It exists only in Greek, or rather (if the above conjecture as to its author be correct) it has only been published in that language. \n\nIt consists of three hundred and four chapters, and professes to be derived from what has been written on the same subject by the Indians, Persians, and Egyptians. It was translated out of Greek into Latin about the year 1160, by Leo Tuscus, of which work two specimens are to be found in Gasp. Barthii \"Adversaria.\" Around 1165, it was used as a source by Pascalis Romanus for his \"Liber thesauri occulti\", a Latin compilation on dream interpretation that also draws on Artemidorus. It was first published at Frankfort, 1577, 8vo., in a Latin translation, made by Leunclavius, from a very imperfect Greek manuscript, with the title \"Apomasaris Apotelesmata, sive de Significatis et Eventis Insomniorum, ex Indorum, Persarum, Aegyptiorumque Disciplina.\" \n\nThe word Apomasares is a corruption of the name of the famous Albumasar, or Abu Ma'shar, and Leunclavius afterwards acknowledged his mistake in attributing the work to him. It was published in Greek and Latin by Rigaltius, and appended to his edition of the \"Oneirocritica\" of Artemidorus, Lutet. Paris. 1603, 4to., and some Greek various readings are inserted by Jacobus De Rhoer in his \"Otium Daventriense\". It has also been translated into Italian, French, and German.\n\n"}
{"id": "882532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882532", "title": "Alex (A Clockwork Orange)", "text": "Alex (A Clockwork Orange)\n\nAlex is a fictional character in Anthony Burgess' novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" and Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of the same name, in which he is played by Malcolm McDowell. In the film, his surname is DeLarge, a reference to Alex calling himself The Large in the novel. In the film, however, two newspaper articles print his name as \"Alex Burgess\". In addition to the book and film, Alex was portrayed by Vanessa Claire Smith in the ARK Theatre Company's multi-media adaptation of \"A Clockwork Orange\", directed by Brad Mays.\n\nAlex is the narrator, protagonist and antihero in the novel \"A Clockwork Orange\". The character is portrayed as a sociopath who robs, rapes, and assaults innocent people for his own amusement. Intellectually, he knows that such behaviour is morally wrong, saying that \"you can't have a society with everybody behaving in my manner of the night\". He nevertheless professes to be puzzled by the motivations of those who wish to reform him and others like him, saying that he would never interfere with their desire to be good; he simply \"goes to the other shop\".\n\nHe speaks Nadsat, a teenage slang created by author Anthony Burgess. The language is based on largely English and Russian words, but also borrows from other sources such as Cockney rhyming slang, Romani speech, and schoolboy colloquialisms. His beverage of choice is milk spiked with various drugs, which he and his fellow gang members (\"droogs\") drink to fortify themselves for \"ultraviolence\". Alex is very fond of classical music, particularly Ludwig van Beethoven, whom he habitually refers to as \"Ludwig Van\". While listening to this music, he fantasises about endless rampages of rape, torture and slaughter. Alex's favourite melee weapon is a \"cut-throat britva\", or straight razor.\n\nAlex lives with his parents in a block of flats in a dystopian England in which his brand of \"ultraviolence\" is common. At the age of 15, he is already a veteran of state reform institutions (In the film, he is somewhat older). While the youngest of his gang, he is the most intelligent, and designates himself as the leader. Another member of the gang, Georgie, resents his high-handedness, and begins plotting against him along with the rest of the gang. One night, the gang breaks into a woman's house, and Alex assaults and kills her by ramming her face with a sculpture of a penis and testicles (in the book it is a bust of Beethoven). As Alex flees from the house after hearing police sirens, Dim hits him with a milk bottle (his chain in the book) and the gang leaves him to be arrested. Alex is found guilty of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nOver the next two years, Alex is a model prisoner, endearing himself to the prison chaplain by studying the Bible. He is especially fond of the passages in the Old Testament portraying torture and murder. Eventually, prison officials recommend him for the Ludovico Technique, an experimental treatment designed to eliminate criminal impulses. During the treatment, prison doctors inject him with nausea-inducing drugs and make him watch films portraying murder, torture and rape. The treatment conditions him to associate violent thoughts and feelings with sickness. Alex is particularly affected by watching footage of Nazi war crimes set to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, one of his favourite pieces of music, and he can no longer hear it without feeling sick.\n\nHis sentence is commuted to time served, and he is released. Once he returns to society, however, he finds that the treatment worked too well: any thought of violence brings him to his knees with pain, and he cannot defend himself. His parents have rented out his room, he is brutalised by his former victims, and beaten by his former accomplices Georgie and Dim, who are now police officers.\n\nHe collapses in front of an old house, owned by a writer the government considers \"subversive\". The writer is one of the gang's victims, but he does not recognise Alex, who had been wearing a mask as he and his friends beat the man and gang-raped his wife, who later died of her injuries. When Alex tells him of his plight, the writer promises to help him. However, the writer realises who Alex is upon hearing him singing \"Singin' in the Rain\", the very song he had sung while raping his wife. He drugs Alex and forces him to listen to the Ninth Symphony, which causes Alex so much pain that he attempts suicide by jumping out of the window.\n\nHe survives, but is badly injured, and wakes up in a state hospital. His parents take him back, while the government, smarting from the bad publicity, gives him a well-paying job. The treatment, meanwhile, has worn off, and Alex is his old ultraviolent self again: \"I was cured all right\".\n\nWhile the film ends here, the novel features an additional chapter in which Alex, now a few years older, outgrows his sociopathy and begins to think about starting a family.\n\nThe American Film Institute rated Alex the 12th greatest film villain of all time. \"Empire\" magazine selected Alex as the 42nd greatest movie character of all time \"Wizard\" magazine rated Alex the 36th greatest villain of all time. Malcolm McDowell's performance has been widely acclaimed by critics. McDowell was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and some consider his failure to receive a Best Actor nomination at the Academy Awards a major snub. In 2008, his performance was ranked #100 on \"Premiere Magazine\"s \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time.\" Vanessa Claire Smith won \"LA Weekly\"s Leading Female Performance award for her gender-bending performance in the stage production of \"A Clockwork Orange\".\n"}

He has led the Social Democratic Rally (RSD-Gaskiya), a political party, since founding it in January 2004. Cheiffou was President of the Economic, Social and Cultural Council of Niger (CESOC) from January 2006 to February 2010, and he held the official post of Ombudsman from August 2011 to December 2015.\n\nCheiffou is an ethnic Fula and was born at Kornaka, in Maradi Department, in 1942. Prior to becoming Prime Minister, Cheiffou worked in Dakar as a representative of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for Central and West Africa. He was a delegate for the Association of Nigeriens Abroad at the 1991 National Conference; at the Conference, he was the compromise choice for the position of Prime Minister, although he was opposed by the delegates representing the government, and was elected on 26 October 1991. His selection as Prime Minister was aided by his political inexperience and lack of association with the old regime of Seyni Kountché and Ali Saibou. Cheiffou headed the transitional government that served from 1991 to 1993, during the transitional period leading to multiparty elections. He also served as Minister of National Defense during that period. Along with President Saibou and André Salifou, the President of the High Council of the Republic, he was prohibited by the National Conference from standing as a candidate in the February 1993 presidential election.\n\nAs of 2002, Cheiffou was the ICAO's Regional Director for its Western and Central African Office.\n\nCheiffou was Vice-President of the Democratic and Social Convention (CDS-Rahama) before splitting with that party and its President, Mahamane Ousmane, and creating his own party, the Social Democratic Rally (RSD-Gaskiya), in January 2004. In the presidential election held on 16 November 2004, Cheiffou placed fourth out of six candidates, winning 6.35% of the vote. He was elected to the National Assembly in the December 2004 parliamentary election as an RSD candidate in Maradi constituency.\n\nWhen the 85-member Economic, Social and Cultural Council (CESOC) was installed by President Mamadou Tandja on 3 January 2006, Cheiffou became President of CESOC.\n\nThe RSD supported President Tandja during the 2009 political crisis, and it participated in the October 2009 parliamentary election. The opposition, angered by President Tandja's efforts to change the constitution so that he could remain in power, boycotted the election. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which had wanted the election delayed in hopes of resolving the political crisis, suspended Niger from its ranks immediately after the election was held. Cheiffou was included in the 22-member Nigerien delegation that traveled to Abuja for talks with ECOWAS beginning on 9 November 2009.\n\nStill serving as President of CESOC, Cheiffou stood as a candidate in the December 2009 local elections and was elected as a municipal councillor in Kornaka. Cheiffou's decision to run for local office was considered striking, as it was rare for major political leaders in Niger to do so.\n\nTandja was ousted in a February 2010 military coup. In the January 2011 presidential election, held under a transitional junta, Cheiffou stood again as a candidate, but received only a small share of the vote. On 10 February 2011, he announced his support for Mahamadou Issoufou, who had placed first, in the March 2011 second round. He backed Issoufou along with many other unsuccessful candidates, buttressing Issoufou's position against his second round opponent, Seyni Oumarou. After Issoufou won the election, Cheiffou was appointed as Ombudsman on 24 August 2011.\n\nOn 13 December 2015, Cheiffou was designated as the RSD candidate for the February 2016 presidential election. In light of his candidacy, he submitted his resignation as Ombudsman to President Issoufou on 21 December 2015, although he stressed that he was not legally required to resign. He was elected to the National Assembly in the February 2016 parliamentary election. As the oldest deputy present, he presided over the National Assembly when it began meeting on 24 March 2016, until the election of Ousseini Tinni as President of the National Assembly on 25 March.\n"}

{"id": "201908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201908", "title": "Axel von Fersen the Younger", "text": "Axel von Fersen the Younger\n\nHans Axel von Fersen (, known as Axel de Fersen in France; 4 September 175520 June 1810) was a Swedish count, Marshal of the Realm of Sweden, a General of Horse in the Royal Swedish Army, one of the Lords of the Realm, aide-de-camp to Rochambeau in the American Revolutionary War, diplomat and statesman, and a friend of Queen Marie-Antoinette of France's. He died at the hands of a Stockholm lynch mob.\n\nvon Fersen was born in 1755 to Field Marshal Axel von Fersen the Elder and countess Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie. He was nephew of Eva Ekeblad and grandson of General Hans Reinhold Fersen. Axel was born the second of four children; he had two sisters, Hedvig Eleonora and Eva Sophie, and one brother, Fabian Reinhold. Two female cousins, Ulrika von Fersen and Christina Augusta von Fersen, were Swedish ladies-in-waiting and leading socialites of the Gustavian age.\n\nFersen's ancestors came from Estonia to Sweden at the time of the Thirty Years' War, which took place from 1618–1648. The family made their name during the reigns of Christina (queen regnant), Charles X, and Charles XI. In 1735, the von Fersen family purchased Steninge Palace, which overlooks Mälaren, a lake outside of Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nvon Fersen's father, the de facto parliamentary leader of the Hats party, was the most politically influential man in Sweden at that time and also one of the richest in the realm. He was the lord of four grand houses in Sweden: Löfstad [inherited through his wife], Steninge, Ljung and Mälsåker. He also owned mines, land, forests and iron foundries in Sweden and Finland, and a large share of Sweden's East India Company, the country's most profitable undertaking ever.\n\nThe younger Axel was influenced by French culture, owing in part to his father's services to Louis XV of France. Under his childhood tutor, von Fersen learned several languages including French, Latin, English, German and Italian. His later education was primarily military.\n\nOn 3 July 1770, von Fersen made his first journey abroad with the intention of seeing the world and finishing his studies at military academies, including Brunswick, Turin, Strasbourg and Lüneburg. In October 1771, he passed through Switzerland and in Ferney, he met the philosopher, Voltaire. In England nearly seven years later, von Fersen looked back on that meeting:\nIn November 1772, von Fersen continued on to Turin, Italy, where he paid a visit to King Charles Emmanuel III. In January 1774 his travels took him to France where he paid court to the reigning monarch, Louis XV, and his mistress, Madame du Barry. While at Versailles he attended the ceremony of the Order of the Holy Spirit. A little over a week later, von Fersen met Marie-Antoinette, then Dauphine, for the first time:\n\nvon Fersen continued the Grand Tour by traveling to England where he stayed for roughly four months and met King George III and Queen Charlotte. By the beginning of 1775, von Fersen had returned to Sweden, where he remained for approximately three years, serving under his king, Gustavus III.\n\nIn the late summer of 1778, von Fersen traveled to Normandy with his friends, Barrington Beaumont and the Baron de Stedingk, to see a large army camp that was training under the command of the Duke of Broglie. Besides military matters, they were treated to dinner and dances attended by the officers and their wives. von Fersen later paid his respects to the French royal family for the first time since his grand tour more than three years earlier:\n\nMarie-Antoinette's personal property, the Petit Trianon, was on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. In contrast to Versailles, the dress and manners at the Petit Trianon were simple and down-to-earth; her guests were personally invited and treated equally, as friends. However, the private festivities often caused jealousy among those who were excluded from them.\n\nIn the 1770s, the American Revolutionary War began with the passage of the Intolerable acts, and the battles of Lexington and Concord, and Bunker Hill. von Fersen told Beaumont that in France \"it is the fashion to rhapsodize over the Americans' rebelliousness against England\". France had officially declared war against her \"natural enemy\" (Great Britain) in February 1778, but in the beginning of 1780, a French contingent was finally being outfitted to fight with the rebels on North American soil.\n\nOn May 4, 1780, von Fersen secured the position of aide-de-camp to General Rochambeau and sailed from the port of Brest. Nearly two months later, his ship made anchor at Narragansett Bay in Newport, Rhode Island, where the French made camp until June of the next year. In mid-September 1780, von Fersen set off as part of Rochambeau's suite to meet the American General, George Washington, in Hartford, Connecticut. Washington's retinue included the young Alexander Hamilton, General Henry Knox and the Marquis de Lafayette. On meeting Washington, von Fersen remarked:\n\nAfter spending eleven months in Newport, Rhode Island, in total inaction, the men under Rochambeau began a march on June 12, 1781, to link up with Washington's army at Philipsburg on the Hudson. On August 15, von Fersen was tasked with conveying a letter from Rochambeau to Comte de Barras, who had been waiting for a signal to join Comte de Grasse's fleet at the Chesapeake Bay. Word reached the troops in early September of Grasse's victory in gaining control of the Chesapeake, and by the end of the month Washington surrounded Cornwallis in Yorktown. By October 19, the British surrendered the town, hastening the end of the war.\n\nvon Fersen and the rest of the French wintered in Williamsburg. Anticipating the American Civil War nearly eighty years later, von Fersen remarked that he wouldn't be surprised to see Virginia separate herself from the rest of the states at some point due to the strain of \"aristocracy\" prevalent there as opposed to the northern states. In December 1782, the French made sail for the West Indies and Venezuela but word reached them of the signing of peace and the ships headed back to France. von Fersen arrived back in Brest in June 1783.\n\nFollowing the end of hostilities, the United States and Sweden concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce. von Fersen was awarded the Order of Cincinnatus by Washington, though he was forbidden by his monarch to wear a medallion earned fighting in a republican war.\n\nIn 1783, Gustavus III asked von Fersen to join him in Germany as Captain of the Guard. Gustavus was planning on making war on Denmark, and was on a trip through the Continent to secure aid from other countries. Gustavus promoted von Fersen to titulary-colonel in the Swedish army, chevalier of the Order of the Sword, and lieutenant-colonel of the light-horse cavalry of the king. Gustavus also used his influence to persuade Louis to have von Fersen appointed proprietary colonel of the Royal Suédois French Army infantry regiment. Louis also appointed von Fersen second-colonel of the Royal Deux-Ponts regiment and chevalier of the Order of Military Merit.\n\nOn June 7, 1784 von Fersen returned to Versailles with Gustavus, who concluded a treaty of alliance with France on the 19th of the month. On June 27, Gustavus and the rest of his entourage were invited to the Petit Trianon. von Fersen sat in the royal box beside Marie-Antoinette. A month later von Fersen returned to Sweden, tasking himself with the job of getting a dog for Marie-Antoinette, which she named Odin.\n\nvon Fersen divided his time between Paris, Versailles, and his new regiment in Valenciennes. During this time, the Diamond Necklace Affair took place, and only months later the Cardinal de Rohan was arrested, bringing the affair to public knowledge. von Fersen wrote to his father in September that everyone believed the Queen (Marie-Antoinette) had fooled the King. In August 1786, Vicomte de Calonne finally apprised Louis XVI of the desperate state of the French finances, and by the very end of the year it was announced formally that there would be a convening of an Assembly of Notables to discuss future measures.\n\nIn late-February 1787, the Assembly of Notables was convened. von Fersen attended the closing of the last day of that meeting, and described the gathering as \"imposing\". von Fersen was secretly entrusted, by Gustavus III, with the role of special envoy to the King and Queen of France. Some sensitive diplomatic contacts between Sweden and France were conducted, not through the Swedish embassy, but through von Fersen. To be closer to Paris, he moved into a house in Auteuil borrowed from Count Esterhazy.\n\nIn spring, 1788, von Fersen joined Gustav for the latter's Finnish campaign against Russia as lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Horse Guards but by December 1788, von Fersen was again with his French regiment in Valenciennes to witness the following:\n\nOn May 2, 1789, the Estates-General finally met. von Fersen and Beaumont sat in one of the boxes of the Salle des Menus Plaisirs on May 5, as Louis read his opening speech. Before long, however, the Third Estate reconstituted itself as the National Assembly, arguing that the three orders were no more than arbitrary divisions of one body. By the end of June, the monarchy had reinforced its concentration of regiments around the capital, ostensibly to maintain order in and around Paris, although many believed the troops would be turned against the recalcitrant Third Estate. von Fersen wrote:\n\nOn July 14, 1789, the Invalides and the Bastille were both stormed and taken, and on July 16, von Fersen was at Versailles with the King and Queen to debate how to forestall the incipient revolution in Paris. After much discussion, Louis decided to go to Paris with the guardsmen to show his personal goodwill towards the revolution. The Princess de Lamballe (who in 1792 would lose her life in the September Massacres) related the scene:\n\nvon Fersen followed Louis to the capital and arrived in time to watch Louis take the national cockade from the mayor, Jean Sylvain Bailly, and placed it in his own hat. On August 8, the August Decrees, which abolished many aspects of monarchy, including tithes and hereditary titles, were enacted. von Fersen wrote from Valenciennes:\n\nMonths later, with the revolution spreading to the rest of the country and the royal army in disintegration, the Flanders Regiment was brought to Versailles to replace the French Guards who had mutinied. The King's bodyguard decided to host a fraternal dinner party for the regiment, and von Fersen and Beaumont attended. Despite having reservations at first, the King and Queen made an appearance towards the end. This banquet, however, provided fuel for the Women's March on Versailles four days later, when it was rumored that the tricolor (cockade) was trampled upon at the banquet. von Fersen was in Versailles to witness the march.\n\nOn the morning of October 6, 1789, an armed crowd made their way to the royal apartments. Two of the royal bodyguards were killed before the National Guard restored order. In order to calm the protestors, Louis agreed to go to the balcony of the Cour de Marbre and tell the crowd that he would return with them to Paris. von Fersen recounts the departure in his diaries:\n\nThe situation of the royal family became considerably more desperate on April 18, 1791, when they were prevented from traveling to Saint-Cloud to attend Mass by a large hostile crowd. Escape plans had been broached earlier between Comte de Mirabeau and von Fersen, but Mirabeau's death on April 2, 1791 put an end to that discussion. Following the aborted trip to Saint Cloud, von Fersen revived these plans with vigor. In June, he acquired a Berline and drove it to a courtyard at Eleanore Sullivan's residence on the Rue de Clichy in Paris. The escape was arranged to take place on June 20, coinciding with a particular guard change.\n\nAt 11:15 p.m. the royal children were brought out without difficulty. At 11:45 the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, appeared followed by Louis himself. A half hour later they were still waiting for Marie-Antoinette. However, she came out at the same time as the torchlit carriage of Marquis de Lafayette, who was responsible for the royal family's custody, appeared with some of his men, Marie-Antoinette was able to conceal herself and the royal family slipped away.\n\nvon Fersen drove the carriage, first from the Place du Carrousel to the Porte Saint-Martin, and then on to the Barrier Saint-Martin where they switched to the Berine. von Fersen continued to drive as far as Bondy, seven miles from Paris, where the Queen's maids and a fresh relay of horses awaited them. The royal family took the post road and von Fersen took a different route to Bourget.\n\nThe royal family reached Varennes on June 22 around 11 p.m., but here they were discovered and eventually held in custody until troops from the National Convention arrived. They departed Varennes surrounded by 6,000 armed citizens and National Guardsmen. Having left behind him a long declaration which had been read and published in all the newspapers in his absence, Louis himself had made it impossible to sustain the pretence that he had been \"abducted\".\n\nEven before the royal family returned to Paris, it was discovered that von Fersen was one of the people who facilitated their escape, and a warrant was put out for his arrest. von Fersen left France and in Koblenz he put himself in touch with Comte d'Artois, the exiled prince, and the former Controller-General, Charles Alexandre de Calonne; together they made plans to convince the other European powers to declare war on France. In Brussels, von Fersen worked out a cypher code and secret methods of writing with Beaumont and Marie-Antoinette:\n\nFrom August 2–14, von Fersen was in Vienna to discuss the situation with Marie-Antoinette's brother Leopold, now Emperor. On August 27, 1791 the Declaration of Pillnitz was issued from Pillnitz Castle near Dresden; it declared the joint support of the Holy Roman Empire and Prussia for King Louis XVI against the Revolution but stipulated that Austria would only go to war if the other European powers followed them into war, which at this point in time was not likely to happen. von Fersen wrote:\nIn December 1791, von Fersen confided to Beaumont about another possible escape attempt for the royal family. Because the roads were closely watched, it was decided that Louis should escape through the woods and then by sea, while von Fersen conveyed Marie-Antoinette and the children by another route. Because security was tight around the royal family, von Fersen traveled to Paris in a large wig and false moustache, and assumed the identity of a minister plenipotentiary of the Queen of Portugal. They arrived in Paris without difficulty, and were able to sneak into the Tuileries and speak with Marie-Antoinette. von Fersen laid the escape plan before Louis, however, the king did not feel that it would work. As he told von Fersen:\n\nThat night von Fersen saw the King and Queen for the last time. After the meeting, von Fersen and Beaumont headed back north. Outside Cambrai, their carriage was stopped by a Frenchman doubting the authenticity of their passport but, with von Fersen feigning sleep, Beaumont managed to talk himself out of trouble and they continued on.\n\nOn March 16, 1792, Gustav III was shot at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm, and died almost two weeks later. In Sweden, Gustav's younger brother, the Duke Karl, became regent to the underage Gustav IV. On April 20, France officially declared war on Austria, and invaded the Austrian Netherlands. On June 20, the Tuileries was stormed by a large crowd and Louis was made to wear a red bonnet of liberty and drink a toast to the health of the people of Paris and the Nation. Three days later Marie-Antoinette was able to get an encrypted letter out to von Fersen: \"Your friend is in the greatest danger. His illness is making terrible progress ... Tell his relations about his unfortunate situation\".\n\nOn November 7, following the French victory at Jemappes, von Fersen wrote from Brussels:\n\nOn January 21, 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined at the Place de Grève. Von Fersen heard the news while in Cologne: \"Received last night at 10:30, from the Archbishop of Tours, the sad details of the death of the King of France\". On February 1, France officially declared war against Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, but the tide quickly turned against the French in the Netherlands. The general in charge of the northern army, Dumouriez, was defeated March 18 at Neerwinden and Louvain. On 18 March, von Fersen was able to meet with him:\n\nOn August 2, Marie-Antoinette was moved to the Conciergerie while awaiting her trial. During this time von Fersen was still attempting to find a way to save her and the remaining royal family. On 11 August he wrote:\n\nOn October 6, 1793, von Fersen paid a visit to Jean-Baptisite Drouet at the Saint-Elizabeth prison on the slim hope of hearing news that might be of use. Drouet was the postmaster who recognized Louis on his flight to Varennes and was able to alert the authorities in time to stop them. Beaumont related the scene from his memoirs:\n\nMarie-Antoinette was executed ten days later. von Fersen heard the news of this while in Brussels:\n\nVon Fersen returned to Sweden, from where he was forced to watch the ever-increasing expansion of the French revolutionary empire, and in late December 1793, he was suspected of possible complicity in Baron Armfeldt's conspiracy to deprive the Duke of Södermanland of the regency. As a result, von Fersen was deprived of his diplomatic appointments and his post as ambassador. In November 1796, Prince Gustav was declared of age and become King Gustav IV Adolf. His accession restored von Fersen, and other supporters of Gustav III's, back to favor at court. Von Fersen and his best friend, Baron Taube, became two of the most influential advisors to the young king, inculcating in him a \"steadfast opposition to Revolutionary France, close relations with Russia, and hostility to Denmark, with the ultimate objective of acquiring Norway\".\n\nIn November 1797, von Fersen attended the Second Congress of Rastatt and met general Napoleon Bonaparte:\n\nWhile in Germany, von Fersen made a trip to Karlsruhe to secure, for Gustav IV Adolf, the hand of the Princess Friederike of Baden's, whom Gustav IV Adolf married in October. In 1799, following von Fersen's return to Sweden from Germany, he was appointed as one of the Lords of the Realm.\n\nIn the fall of that year, Gustav IV Adolf was concerned about the level of sympathy for the French Revolution in the city of Uppsala. After students at Uppsala University celebrated Bonaparte's return to France from his Italian campaigns, Gustav IV Adolf appointed von Fersen as Chancellor of Uppsala. According to Adlerbeth, this amounted to \"a declared French royalist being made the Swedish Jacobins' schoolmaster\". That winter a wave of rioting occurred in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Norrköping, Linköping, Malmö, and other Swedish towns following the onset of a severe winter and famine. Von Fersen wrote: \"Who, given the spirit that now prevails, can guarantee that there will not be a general upheaval.\"\n\nIn April, an attempt to trick the Uppsala orchestra into performing a composition containing an excerpt from the \"La Marseillaise\" led to the trial and punishment of four known radicals of the university, one of whom was dismissed. The \"Music Trial\" proved the deathblow to Uppsala radicalism.\n\nWith the state bordering on financial bankruptcy, and poor harvests and declining trade undermining his efforts to resolve the issue without recourse to parliament, Gustav IV Adolf reluctantly announced the first assembly of the Riksdag. The Riksdag, dissolved in mid-June but not before several prominent aristocrats walked out and renounced their noble status. Though creating a much-talked about sensation, they had virtually left a vacuum in the political field which their rivals filled.\n\nIn 1801, von Fersen was appointed Marshal of the Realm. He was now the highest official in the court of Sweden. Around this time, von Fersen's sister, Sophie, returned to Sweden from Germany and took over his household in lieu of a wife.\n\nFollowing the overthrow and exile of King Gustavus IV in 1809, a dispute over the Royal succession divided the nobility and much of Swedish society. Von Fersen, now Earl Marshal of Sweden, led a political faction (\"the Gustavians\") which supported Gustavus' son against the popular Crown Prince Charles August.\n\nOn May 28, 1810, while reviewing troops in Scania, Charles August fell from his horse and died from apoplexy. Rumors ran strong throughout the country that he had been poisoned by the partisans of Gustav IV Adolf; von Fersen and his sister Sophie were seen as prime suspects. They were abused in public, and von Fersen received anonymous death threats.\n\nJune 20, 1810 was the date set for the Crown Prince's public funeral. The \"Livgarde till Häst\" (Horse Guards) formed the advance guard in the procession; von Fersen, as Marshal of the Realm, and other court dignitaries, rode in coaches before the coffin, while the rear of the procession was brought up by a squadron of cavalry which had accompanied the Crown Prince's remains from Scania. Foot Guards paraded on the Riddarhustorget. General Silfversparre, commander of the Stockholm garrison, was alerted to the possibility of disturbances but may himself have been a member of the court party that opposed von Fersen. The procession proceeded slowly through the Hornsgatan and Södermalm Square, and was met with threats and insults as soon as it entered the city.\n\nVon Fersen, with a violent effort, flung back one of the ruffians who grasped him and shook himself free of the others who were pressing round. There was a momentary lull; the curses shrank from shouts to mutterings. Von Fersen's face bled where a stone had cut it; his decorations were glittering in the sun; the guards, who were supposed to protect him, gazed at him with a sort of curious expectancy.\n\nIt was at this moment when Beaumont arrived on the scene with General Silfversparre and a small detachment of troops. This intervention further enraged the large crowd. Von Fersen, realizing that the authorities planned to do nothing, turned and dashed into the first door he could find. The crowd converged on this spot, and a few ran into the house in pursuit of him.\n\nBefore long, one man appeared at the window \"and with a triumphant shout\" hurled down von Fersen's cloak and sword, which were seized by the angry crowd. Von Fersen was dragged back out into the square. His gloves were pulled off and thrown in his face, and his coat torn off and trampled upon. Silfversparre, attempting to save von Fersen, offered to arrest him and have him tried in court for the Crown Prince's murder. At this moment, the mounted escort turned and rode away. The mob \"which had been almost quiet, but now raised yells of delight and triumph, and fell upon von Fersen\".\n\nVon Fersen's contemporary, Baron Gustaf Armfelt, stated afterward:\n\nAxel von Fersen died that day in Stockholm as Sweden's highest-ranking official next to the King; his death sent shock waves throughout the country. The cause of death was determined to be \"crushing of the ribcage\" when the Swedish-Finn Otto Johan Tandefelt jumped with both feet on Fersen's chest.\n\nA few months after the murder, von Fersen and his family were cleared of any suspicion connected with the death of Carl August of Augustenburg, and he finally received a state burial with all pomp and ceremony. His sister, Sophie Piper, withdrew from Stockholm to her Löfstad manor, near Norrköping. Here she raised a memorial to her brother, with the inscription:\n\n\"Åt en oförgätlig broder, mannamodet uti hans sista stunder den 20 juni 1810 vittna om hans dygder och sinnes lugn\" ()\n\nThe young nobleman was a favorite at the French court, owing partly to the recollection of his father's devotion to France, but principally because of his own amiable qualities. Queen Marie-Antoinette, who had first met von Fersen when they both were 18, was especially attracted by the grace and wit of \"le beau\" von Fersen. However, it was nearly four years later, on von Fersen's second visit to France in the summer of 1778, when the relationship blossomed. Here he was accepted by Marie-Antoinette into her trusted circle and invited to her private gatherings at the Petit Trianon. It seems that the friendship grew very quickly and caused jealousy among those at court. By the account of Beaumont's, von Fersen left for the war in America in the early part of 1780 to avoid causing a scandal, as it was widely known that the two were close, and it was rumored that he was the Queen's lover. Beaumont wrote in his memoirs that von Fersen asked Gustaf Philip Creutz to use his influence, as Swedish ambassador to France, to get von Fersen appointed as \"aide-de-camp\" to Rochambeau. According to Creutz in a letter to Gustav III:\n\nIt is impossible to state how far the relationship went. It was difficult for the Queen of France to remain alone for long; she was almost always accompanied by others, such as attendants of the court. At the time that Marie-Antoinette was rumored to be Axel's lover, she was also rumored to be the lovers of the Duc d'Orléans, the Comte d'Artois, and others.\n\n\n\n"}

He worked for Yang Enterprises (YEI) until February 2001. He is notable chiefly for making a series of whistleblower allegations about his former employer and about Republican Congressman Tom Feeney, including an allegation that in 2000, Feeney and Yang Enterprises requested Curtis's assistance in a scheme to steal votes by inserting fraudulent code into touch screen voting systems.\n\nIn 2006, Curtis ran unsuccessfully against Feeney for the United States congressional seat in Florida's 24th congressional district. He ran again in 2008, losing in the Democratic primary to eventual winner of the seat, Suzanne Kosmas.\n\nIn 2007, Curtis enrolled as a student at the Barry University School of Law in Orlando, Florida.\n\nIn 2010, Clint Curtis was the Democratic nominee for Congress in California's 4th district, ultimately losing to incumbent Representative Tom McClintock.\n\nIn 2001, Curtis first achieved public attention for a series of allegations against his former employer, Yang Enterprises, and against Tom Feeney, who was at that time serving as a Florida state legislator and as Yang's attorney and as Yang's lobbyist for local governments.\n\nOn May 10, 2001, shortly after leaving Yang and accepting a job with the Florida Department of Transportation, Curtis reported that Yang had overbilled the FDOT and hired an illegal alien. Approximately a year later, on April 1, 2002, Curtis and his supervisor were both fired, allegedly for violating FDOT policies. (Although Curtis's supervisor later settled a retailiation lawsuit brought relating to her firing, Curtis reports that he did not sue because he \"missed the filing deadline.\") During that same year, Curtis's accusations against Yang were the subject of a series of articles in the Daytona Beach News-Journal. \n\nYang Enterprises denied Curtis's allegations, and alleged that Curtis was a disgruntled former employee. According to the \"St. Petersburg Times\", Curtis made his initial accusations against Yang one day after attorneys for Yang Enterprises questioned whether Curtis's employment with the FDOT violated a non-compete agreement and whether Curtis had taken a confidential computer program with him when he left Yang. According to the \"St. Petersburg Times\", \"Curtis said he would not have filed complaints about Yang if the company had not harassed him.\" Curtis denies that he stole any software from Yang Enterprises, and as of August 10, 2006, a lawsuit between Yang and Curtis was ongoing in Leon County, Florida.\n\nUltimately, Curtis' initial allegations led to mixed results:\n\nIn September 2004, Curtis self-published \"Just A Fly On The Wall\", a book critical of the George W. Bush administration, Yang Enterprises, and Tom Feeney. In the edition of that book published before the 2004 election, Curtis focused on his earlier accusations against Yang, as well as accusations that Feeney used his influence with the Florida State government to Yang's benefit.\n\nCurtis specifically alleged that:\n\nAt the behest of Rep. Tom Feeney, in September 2000, he was asked to write a program for a touchscreen voting machine that would make it possible to change the results of an election undetectably. Curtis assumed initially that this effort was aimed at detecting Democratic fraud, but later learned that it was intended to benefit the Republican Party.\n\nCurtis explained that the software could be used in any electronic tabulation machine or scanner. He spoke about this to the Conyers Voting Forum, after Conyers left the forum and turned over the dais on December 13, 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Feeney responded to Curtis's allegations in a news article posted in the \"St. Petersburg Times\". According to the newspaper, Feeney stated:\n\nOn March 3, 2005, Curtis passed a polygraph test given by Tim Robinson, the retired chief polygraph operator and 20-year veteran of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The polygraph was paid for by Kevin Walsh, a private investigator from Washington, D.C., who told the \"St. Petersburg Times\" that he had been hired to prove election fraud. Walsh refused to identify the client. Curtis has stated that the test was based on all the allegations in the affidavit that was provided to Conyers' Voting Forum.\n\nIn 2006, Curtis ran a campaign to unseat Republican incumbent Tom Feeney, the former attorney for Yang Enterprises and the person who Curtis had accused, since 2004, of soliciting Curtis to assist in attempted vote fraud in the 2000 election.\n\nCurtis won the Democratic primary.\n\nCurtis's accusations that Feeney solicited him to commit vote fraud played a central role in the campaign, with Curtis challenging Feeney to take a polygraph test to prove that Feeney did not commit vote fraud and Feeney engaging in a campaign to trivialize Curtis, including a website that called Curtis \"crazy\" and featured photos of Curtis altered to include a tin-foil hat, and a controversial flier with Curtis's head superimposed on what appeared to be Hugh Hefner's body. Feeney refused to debate Curtis, arguing that any debate would be a \"disservice\" to voters.\n\nOn October 26, 2006, \"The Orlando Sentinel\" reported on the status of Curtis's race against Tom Feeney. According to the \"Sentinel\", although both Curtis and Feeney had reported that their internal polling showed them to be leading in the polls, a Zogby poll showed the race to be extremely close, with Feeney leading Curtis by 45 percent to 43 percent, with a 5 percent margin of error. \n\n\"The Sentinel\" reported that \"local political observers\" attributed the tight race to several factors, including:\n\nCurtis lost the general election, garnering 42 percent to Feeney's 58 percent of the vote, or 89,863 votes to Feeney's 123,795.\n\nOn December 13, 2004, \"Wired News\" reported on Curtis's allegations. After repeating Curtis's allegations, summarized above, and Yang Enterprises' denial of those allegations, \"Wired\" concluded that \"it remains to be seen if any new investigations can uncover the truth\".

He was a descendant of the great Kalonymus family of Mainz, and a disciple of Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg (Judah he-Hasid), who initiated him into the study of the Kabbalah, at that time little known in Germany. According to Zunz, Eleazar was hazzan at Erfurt before he became rabbi at Worms. In 1233 he took part in the Synod of Mainz which enacted the body of regulations known as \"Takkanot Shum\" (ShUM = \"Speyer, Worms, Mainz\"), of which he was a signatory.\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", Eleazar underwent great sufferings during the Crusades. The \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" states that on the night of 22 Kislev, 1196, he was engaged on his commentary on \"Genesis\" (Eleazar relates that he had reached the parashah Vayeshev), when two Crusaders entered his house and killed his wife Dulca (Dolce), his two daughters Belet(Belette) and Hannah, and wounded him and his son Jacob. His wife had conducted a business in parchment scrolls in order to support the family and enable him to devote all his time to study. Many of the \"piyyutim\" he authored protest at Israel's suffering and hope for redemption and revenge against her tormentors. He also recorded the deaths of his family in a moving and poetic eulogy.\n\nEleazar developed a vigorous activity in many directions. On the one hand, he was a Talmudist of vast erudition, a liturgist gifted with a clear and easy style, and an astronomer, and was well versed in the sciences open to the Jews of Germany at that time. At the same time, he was an adventurous mystic who experienced visions, seeing legions of angels and demons. He exerted himself to spread mystical systems which went far beyond the conceptions of the classical authors of Jewish esoterica. In his mystical works he developed and gave a new impulse to the mysticism associated with the letters of the alphabet. By the gematria and notarikon systems of interpretation found in the Talmud, Eleazar invented new combinations by which miracles could be performed. The haggadic anthropomorphism which he had combated in his earlier works (\"Ha-Roḳeaḥ,\" \"Sha'are ha-Sod weha-Yiḥud\") occupied later the foremost place in his mystical writings.\nEleazar's great merit therefore lies not only in his new mystical system, but also in his ethical works. In these he shows greatness of soul and a piety bordering upon asceticism. Though so severely tried by fate, he inculcates cheerfulness, patience, and love for humanity. He died at Worms in 1238.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these works, Eleazar wrote tosafot to many Talmudical treatises, referred to by Bezalel Ashkenazi in his \"Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet\"; a commentary on \"Sheḳalim\" in the Jerusalem Talmud, cited by Asheri in his commentary to that treatise in the Babylonian Talmud; thirty-six chapters on the examination of slaughtered animals (MS. Michael No. 307). Zunz enumerates fifty-five liturgical poems and dirges composed by Eleazar and occurring in the Ashkenazic \"maḥzorim\", \"ḳinot\", and \"seliḥot\".\n"}

The operation of mass expulsions from Zamojszczyzna region around the city of Zamość (now in Lublin Voivodeship, Poland) was carried out between November 1942 and March 1943 on direct order from Heinrich Himmler. It was preplanned by both, Globocnik from Action Reinhard and Himmler, as the first stage of the eventual murderous ethnic cleansing ahead of projected Germanization of the entire General Government territory.\n\nIn Polish historiography, the events surrounding the Nazi German roundups are often named alternatively as the to emphasize the simultaneous apprehension of around 30,000 children at that time, snatched away from their parents transported from Zamojszczyzna to concentration camps and slave labour in Nazi Germany. According to historical sources the German police and military expelled 116,000 Polish men and women in just a few months during Action Zamość.\n\nWartime fate of the Polish children from Zamojszczyzna was closely related to the German plans for the expansion of their own so-called \"living space in the East\", part of a broader Nazi policy called the \"Generalplan Ost\". The plans for \"ethnically cleansing the land\" of its inhabitants were created in the fall of 1941 in Berlin and were closely connected with the idea of the new great consolidation of German nationhood. Country-wide actions dubbed \"Heim ins Reich\" (\"Home to the Reich\") were conducted across all of Central and Eastern Europe (see Action Saybusch in Polish Silesia). Their main purpose was to transplant colonists of the German origin from Russia, Romania, and other countries, to occupied Poland. At the beginning of war, the programme was mainly realised in western parts of Poland, including Wielkopolska, Silesia and Pomerania already controlled by Nazi Germany; but after Operation Barbarossa, it was continued throughout the General Government.\n\nIn order to prepare the land for the new German settlers, both German military and all \"branches of police\" including \"Sonderdienst\", aided by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police battalions, conducted mass deportations of native Polish inhabitants using Holocaust trains as well as lorries and even horse-drawn wagons. Zamojszczyzna was recognized as one of the core German settlement areas in \"Distrikt Galizien\", and according to the order of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler became the first intervention target in the region. People of Ukrainian blood, subjects of parallel transfer called \"Heim ins Reich Ukraineraktion\" , were also to be resettled there.\n\nThe German Wehrmacht attacked the Soviet forces in eastern Poland on June 22, 1941, and in the euphoric atmosphere surrounding their initial victories, the \"Aktion Zamosc\" was first outlined by Himmler together with Governor Hans Frank who initially requested that the programme be delayed until complete victory, but was convinced otherwise. In accordance with the General Plan East, the first forcible removal of the 2,000 inhabitants from selected villages was conducted between 6th and 25 of November 1941, while the general deportation programme began a year later on the night of 27–28 November 1942 in Skierbieszów and its vicinity. By then, the murderous Operation Reinhard was already in full swing.\n\nThe expulsions encompassed the districts of Hrubieszów, Tomaszów Lubelski, Zamość and Biłgoraj, and were completed in March 1943. In total 297 Polish villages were depopulated. A concentration camp was created in Zamość around the streets of Piłsudskiego and Okrzei. Initially, it was a transit camp for Soviet POWs, rebuilt and expanded with 15 new barracks added for the imprisonment of rounded up families. \"SS-Unterscharführer\" Artur Schütz was appointed the camp's commandant. From there, transports of children no older than 14 years of age – whose names have already been Germanized – were sent elsewhere. Historians estimate that 116,000 people in total were forcibly removed from Zamojszczyzna, among them 30,000 children.\n\nThe camp in Zamość , located on S. Okrzei street, served as the transit point for selections and further deportations. In the first month of Action Zamość the camp processed 7,055 Polish inhabitants of 62 villages. People were divided into four main categories with the following code letters: \"WE\" (re-Germanization), \"AA\" (transport to the Reich), \"RD\" (farm-work for the settlers), \"KI\" (\"Kindertransport\"), \"AG\" (work in the General Government); and finally, \"KL\" (concentration camp). Those expelled from Zamojszczyzna to perform slave labour in Germany were loaded onto trains departing for temporary displacement camps governed by main resettlement HQ in Łodź. People from the last group were sent to the Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz and Majdanek.\n\nThe camp in Zamość processed 31,536 Poles according to Germany's own records, or 41,000 based on postwar estimates. Dispossessed Polish families were sent to other transit camps as well including Zwierzyniec in the Zamość County, which processed 20,000-24,000 Poles (12,000 between July and August 1943). Transit camps existed in Budzyń, Frampol, Lublin (on Krochmalna street), Stary Majdan, Biłgoraj County, Tarnogród, Wola Derezieńska, Old Wedan, Biłgoraj and also in Puszcza Solska. Race selections based on forcible abduction of children from their parents were conducted in all of them. The term \"Children of Zamojszczyzna\" originates from the multitude of those locations.\n\nChildren suffered the most in those camps. The average stay lasted several months. Starvation, cold, disease were fatal for them a lot more often than for adults. Separated from their parents, children were transported in cattle wagons (100 up to 150 children in one wagon) to other destinations. Many of them were sent to the concentration camp for children run side-by-side with the Łódź Ghetto. Kinder KZ processed up to 13,000 children. News about enormous drama of children from Zamojszczyzna quickly spread through entire country. Polish railwayman were forwarding messages about transports to inhabitants of the cities where transports were stopping by. There were several stations where ordinary people took a chance and risked rescuing the children, like in Sobolew, Żelechów, Siedlce, Garwolin, Pilawa and Warsaw. Another deportation action, called Operation Werwolf, was conducted during the summer of 1944 ahead of the Soviet advance. Many of the inhabitants were forced to evacuate after being previously transferred into these areas by Germany as early as 1939. Entire families ended up in concentration camps at Majdanek (up to 15,000 prisoners of Action Zamość) and Oświęcim, before deportation to forced labour in the Reich. At Majdanek, due to severe overcrowding, entire train-loads were kept in open fields numbered from III to V.\n\nThere was also a portion of children designated for germanisation. Those, in which German anthropologists confirmed the presence of desirable racial traits, were supposed to go through transition by being placed in German families or German orphanages.\nOut of several thousand of children taken to Germany only 800 were successfully reclaimed.\nAfter the World War II this atrocity was investigated in Nuremberg. From Polish side statements came from Zygmunt Klukowski – a doctor from Szczebrzeszyn, who knew well conditions of camps in Zwierzyniec and Biłgoraj, and from three of the returned children.\n\n\n"}

In 1976 International Computers Limited (ICL) acquired Singer Business Machines, changing the name of the computer to the ICL 1500.\n\nCogar was last seen Friday, September 2, 1983, when a private plane, a Britten-Norman Islander, went down somewhere in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nCogar and his wife Ann established the Cogar Foundation for the express purpose of awarding grants and scholarships to students of Herkimer County.\n\n3,166,715 Asynchronous Self Controlled Shift Register <br>\n3,261,003 TAPE ERROR INDICATION APPARATUS <br>\n3,510,680 ASYNCHRONOUS SHIFT REGISTER WITH DATA CONTROL GATING THEREFOR <br>\n3,550,103 Reverse Write and Forward Verify Read of a Variable Length Data Record <br>\n3,794,980 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION OF INSTRUCTIONS AND NESTING OF SUBROUTINES IN A DATA PROCESSOR <br>\n4,365,742 Heating System <br>\n4,609,613 Permanent reproductions and formation method therefor <br>\n3,410,312 Fluid Shift Flip-Flop 3,410,312\n\n3,188,621 DISPLAY PANELS WITH SELECTABLE INDICATORS 3,188,621\n\n3,239,809 Skew Correction Buffer \n\n3,426,415 Printed Circuit Assembly Apparatus \n\n3,283,255 Phase Modulation System For Reading Particular Information \n\n3,282,205 PRINT CONTROL MEANS FOR HIGH SPEED PRINTER WITH TRAVELING PRINT BAR \n\n3,310,660 ASYNCHRONOUS COUNTING DEVICES \n\n3,483,523 DATA RECORDING AND VERIFYING MACHINE \n\n3,807,614 BACKSPACE MECHANISM FOR A TAPE HANDLING APPARATUS FOR A DATA RECORDER \n\n3,193,697 SYNCHRONIZED SINGLE PULSER \n\n3,585,619 MAGNETIC TAPE READOUT SYSTEM WITH MEANS TO GENERATE ARTIFICIAL SIGNALS \n\n3,578,257 TAPE HANDLING APPARATUS FOR DATA RECORDER \n\n3,555,306 KEYBOARD SPROCKET CIRCUIT \n\n3,624,838 ADDRESS COUNTER STAGE CIRCUITRY \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1721178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1721178", "title": "George Morland", "text": "George Morland\n\nGeorge Morland (26 June 1763 in London29 October 1804 in Brighton) was an English painter. His early work was influenced by Francis Wheatley (painter) but after the 1790s he came into his own style. His best compositions focus on rustic scenes: farms and hunting; smugglers and gypsies; and rich, textured landscapes informed by Dutch Golden Age painting. \n\nGeorge Morland was born in London on 26 June 1763. He was the son of Henry Robert Morland, and grandson of George Henry Morland, said by Cunningham to have been lineally descended from Sir Samuel Morland, while other biographers go so far as to say that he had only to claim the baronetcy in order to get it. \nMorland began to draw at the age of three years, and at the age of ten (1773) his name appears as an honorary exhibitor of sketches at the Royal Academy. He continued to exhibit at the Free Society in 1775 and 1776, and at the Society of Artists in 1777, and then again at the Royal Academy in 1778, 1779 and 1780.\n\nHis talents were carefully cultivated by his father, who was accused of stimulating them unduly with a view to his own profit, shutting the child up in a garret to make drawings from pictures and casts for which he found a ready sale. \nThe boy, on the other hand, is said to have soon found a way to make money for himself by hiding some of his drawings, and lowering them at nightfall out of his window to young accomplices, with whom he used to spend the proceeds in frolic and self-indulgence. \nIt has been also asserted that his father, discovering this trick, tried to conciliate him by indulgence, humouring his whims and encouraging his low tastes.\n\nHe was set by his father to copy pictures of all kinds, but especially of the Dutch and Flemish masters. Among others he copied Fuseli's \"Nightmare\" and Reynolds's \"Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy\". \nHe was also introduced to Sir Joshua Reynolds, and obtained permission to copy his pictures, and all accounts agree that before he was seventeen he had obtained considerable reputation not only with his friends and the dealers, but among artists of repute. \nA convincing proof of the skill in original composition which he had then attained is the fine engraving by William Ward, after his picture of \"The Angler's Repast\", which was published in November 1780 by John Raphael Smith. \nIt is said that before his apprenticeship to his father came to an end, in 1784, Romney offered to take him into his own house, with a salary of £300, on condition of his signing articles for three years. \nBut Morland, we are told, had had enough of restraint, and after a rupture with his father he set up on his own account in 1784 or 1785 at the house of a picture dealer, and commenced that life which, in its combination of hard work and hard drinking, is almost without a parallel.\n\nMorland soon became the mere slave of the dealer with whom he lived. \nHis boon companions were \"ostlers, potboys, horse jockeys, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, punks, and pugilists.\"\nIn this company the handsome young artist swaggered, dressed in a green coat, with large yellow buttons, leather breeches, and top boots. \"He was in the very extreme of foppish puppeyism\", says Hassell; \"his head, when ornamented according to his own taste, resembled a snowball, after the model of Tippey Bob, of dramatic memory, to which was attached a short, thick tail, not unlike a painter's brush.\"\nHis youth and strong constitution enabled him to recover rapidly from his excesses, and he not only employed the intervals in painting, but at this time, or shortly afterwards, taught himself to play the violin. \nHe made also an effort, and a successful one, to free himself from his task-master, and escaped to Margate, where he painted miniatures for a while. \nIn 1785 he paid a short visit to France, whither his fame had preceded him, and where he had no lack of commissions.\n\nReturning to London, he lodged in a house at Kensal Green, on the road to Harrow, near William Ward, intercourse with whose family seems for a time to have had a steadying influence. It resulted in his marriage with Miss Anne Ward (Nancy), the sister of his friend, in July 1786, and the bond between the families was strengthened a month later by the marriage of William Ward and Morland's sister Maria. \nThe two newly married couples set up house together in High Street, Marylebone, and Morland for a while appeared to have become a reformed character. \nHe was now becoming known by such engravings from his pictures as the large 'Children Nutting' (1783), and several smaller and more sentimental subjects published in 1785, like the ' Lass of Livingston.' To 1786, the year of his marriage, is said to belong the series of 'Letitia or Seduction' (well known from the engravings published in 1789), in which with much of the narrative power of Hogarth, but with softer touches, the 'Progress' of Letitia is told in six scenes admirable in design, and painted with great skill, finish, and refinement. About this period he was fond of visiting the Isle of Wight, where he painted his best coast scenes, and studied life and character in a low public-house at Freshwater Gate, called the Cabin. In 1786 he painted \"The Wreck of the Haswell\", an oil on canvas. It shows women and children clutching what little of the ship remains afloat while a crewman's eyes tell the eventual fate of his half-submerged body. It clearly conveys the terror and hopelessness that must grip people when they know they're taking their last breath.\n\nAfter three months the double household was broken up by dissensions between the ladies, and Morland took lodgings in Great Portland Street, and afterwards moved to Camden Town, where he lived in a small house in Pleasing Passage, at the back of the tavern known as Mother Black Cap. The attractions of the neighbouring inns, and of the Assembly Rooms at Kentish Town, now proved too strong for him, and he returned to all his bad habits. \nA long illness of his wife, following her confinement and death of the child, further weakened the influence of home, and he neglected and ultimately left his wife, though he seems to have made her an allowance as long as he lived. \nWhen he finally separated from her it is not easy to determine, and his course afterwards was so erratic that it is difficult to trace it with minuteness and order. He moved from Pleasing Passage to Warrens Lane, and seems for some time to have made his headquarters at Paddington. \nIt was here probably that he painted the celebrated picture of 'The Inside of a Stable,' now in the National Gallery, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1791. \nThe stable is said to be that of the White Lion Inn at Paddington, opposite to which he lived. \nAt this time he was at the plenitude of his power, and dissipation had not impaired the sureness of his touch, his unusually fine sense of colour, or the refinement of his artistic feeling. He exhibited again in 1793 and 1794, but though he still painted finely he had become completely the prey of the dealers, painting as it were from hand to mouth to supply himself with funds for his extravagances. \nHis art was so popular that, comparatively small as was the price which he actually received for his labour, he might have easily lived for a week on the earnings of a day. He was besieged by dealers who came to him, as it is said, with a purse in one hand and a bottle in the other. \nThe amount of work he got through was prodigious. \nHe would paint one or two pictures a day, and once painted a large landscape with six figures in the course of six hours. \nEvery demand that was made upon him, whether a tavern score or the renewal of a bill, was paid by a picture. \nAnd they were good pictures too, generally worth many times the value of the account to be settled, and always popular in engravings. \n\nFrom 1788 to 1792 inclusive, over a hundred engravings after Morland were published. \nThey included 'A Visit to the Child at Home' and 'A Visit to the Boarding School,' two compositions of remarkable refinement and elegance, and a number of charming scenes of children's sports, like 'Children Birdnesting,' 'Juvenile Navigation,' 'The Kite entangled,' 'Blind Man's Buff,' and 'Children playing at Soldiers.' Equalling if not exceeding these in popularity were scenes of moral contrast, like 'The Fruits of early Industry and Economy' (1789) and 'The Effects of Extravagance and Idleness' (1794), the 'Miseries of Idleness' and the 'Comforts of Industry,' both published in 1790, and subjects appealing to national sentiment, like 'The Slave Trade' (1791) and 'African Hospitality.' Five hundred copies of the engraving of 'Dancing Dogs' (1790) were sold in a few weeks, and one dealer gave an order for nine dozen sets of the four plates of 'The Deserter' (1791). Elegant and refined subjects gradually gave place exclusively to scenes from humble life in town and country, including the coast with fishermen and smugglers, sporting scenes, but more frequently, in a plain but seldom a coarse manner, the life of the cottage, the stable, and the inn-yard, with lively groups of natural men and women, and still more natural horses, donkeys, dogs, pigs, poultry, and other animals. \nAbout 250 separate engravings from his works appeared in his lifetime.\n\nAlthough the publishers reaped the benefits of their large sale, Morland's credit and resources enabled him for some years to lead the rollicking life he loved without much pressure of care. \nAt one time he kept eight saddle horses at the White Lion. \nAs time went on debts increased and creditors became more pressing, and he lived a hunted life, only able to escape from the bailiffs by his knowledge of London and the assistance of friends and dealers. He flitted from one house to another, residing among other places at Lambeth, East Sheen, Queen Anne Street, the Minories, Kensington, and Hackney. \nAt Hackney his seclusion aroused the suspicion that he was a forger of bank notes, and his premises were searched at the instance of the bank directors, who afterwards made him a present of 40l. for the inconvenience caused by their mistake.\n\nDealers and innkeepers also would keep rooms ready for him to paint in, supplied with the necessary materials, and there was generally some dealer at hand ready to carry off his pictures before they were dry, often before they were finished. \nMorland was not, however, much more scrupulous in his dealings than the dealers themselves, and a picture begun under contract with one would be parted with to another who had money in his hand, if the rightful owner was not there to claim it. \nIn this way a number of pictures got into the market commenced by Morland, and finished by inferior hands, while hundreds of copies were made and sold as originals. 'I once saw,' says Hassell, 'twelve copies from a small picture of Morland's at one time in a dealer's shop, with the original in the centre.' \nAnother dealer (according to Redgrave), in whose house he painted under contract in the morning for several years (commencing about 1794), had each morning's work regularly copied. Occasionally Morland managed to escape from both dealers and bailiffs. \nOnce he paid a visit to Claude Lorraine Smith in Leicestershire. \nHe was apprehended as a spy at Yarmouth. \nHe painted the sign of an inn called the Black Bull, somewhere on the road between Deal and London.\n\nIn November 1799, Morland was at last arrested for debt, but was allowed to take lodgings 'within the rules,' and these became the rendezvous of his most discreditable friends. \nDuring this mitigated confinement he sank lower and lower. \nHe is said to have often been drunk for days together, and to have generally slept on the floor in a helpless condition. \nIt is probable that these stories are exaggerated, for he still produced an enormous quantity of good work. \n'For his brother alone,' says Redgrave, 'he painted 192 pictures between 1800 and 1804, and he probably painted as many more for other dealers during the same period, his terms being four guineas a day and his drink.' \nAnother account says that 'during his last eight years he painted 490 pictures for his brother, and probably three hundred more for others, besides making hundreds of drawings. \nHis total production is estimated at no less than four thousand pictures. \nIn 1802, he was released under the Insolvent Debtors Act, but his health was ruined and his habits irremediable. \nAbout this time he was seized with palsy and lost the use of his left hand, so that he could not hold his palette. \nNotwithstanding he seems to have gone on painting to the last, when he was arrested again for a publican's score, and died in a sponging-house in Eyre Street, Cold Bath Fields, on 27 October 1804. His wife died three days afterwards, and both were buried together in the burial-ground attached to St. James's Chapel in the Hampstead Road.\n\nThe finest of Morland's pictures were executed between 1790 and 1794, and amongst them his picture \"The inside of a stable\" (Tate Britain, London) may be reckoned as a masterpiece. In the last eight years of his life Morland produced some nine hundred paintings, besides over a thousand drawings.\n\nHe exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1784 down to 1804. \nAmongst these was the remarkable 1788 picture \"Execrable Human Traffic or the Affectionate Slaves\". \nTwo years later he exhibited a companion picture showing Africans caring for shipwrecked Europeans. They were subsequently published as prints and served to promote abolitionism.\n\nMorland was a close friend of fellow artist, William Armfield Hobday (1771–1831) who painted a portrait of the artist which is still intact. William Collins was an informal pupil and later wrote a biography.\n\n\n\nEarly biographies include those by: William Collins (1805), Francis William Blagdon (1806), John Hassell (1806) and George Dawe (1807).\n\n"}

{"id": "4668387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4668387", "title": "Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "text": "Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nHacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are practical jokes and pranks meant to prominently demonstrate technical aptitude and cleverness, or to commemorate popular culture and historical topics. The pranks are anonymously installed at night by hackers, usually, but not exclusively, undergraduate students. The actions of hackers are governed by an extensive and informal body of precedent, tradition, and ethics. Hacks can occur anywhere across campus, or occasionally off campus; many make use of the iconic Great Dome, Little Dome, Green Building tower, or other prominent architectural features of the MIT campus. Well-known hacker alumni include Nobel Laureates Richard P. Feynman and George F. Smoot. In October 2009, US President Barack Obama made a humorous reference to the MIT hacking tradition during an on-campus speech about clean energy.\n\nAlthough the practice is unsanctioned by the university, and students have sometimes been arraigned on trespassing charges for hacking, hacks have substantial significance to MIT's history and student culture. Student bloggers working for the MIT Admissions Office have often written about MIT hacks, including those occurring during Campus Preview Weekend (CPW), an event welcoming admitted prospective freshman students. Alumni bloggers on the MIT Alumni Association website also report and document some of the more memorable hacks. Since the mid-1970s, the student-written guide \"How To Get Around MIT (HowToGAMIT)\" has included a chapter on hacking, and discusses history, hacker groups, ethics, safety tips, and risks of the activity.\n\nFor a decade, the MIT Museum included a \"Hall of Hacks\" featuring famous MIT hacks, but the section was closed in 2001, temporarily returning for a 2003 exhibition. In 2011, the display space was reallocated to the \"MIT 150\" exhibition, a year-long show commemorating MIT's 150th anniversary. Although hacks were not featured in the exhibit, certain student activities such as the Annual Baker House Piano Drop were featured in the exhibition. The Museum's extensive collection of hacker artifacts and documentation continues to be preserved and expanded, with a selection of larger relics from past hacks plus explanatory panels and plaques semi-permanently displayed inside the Stata Center. This mini-exhibit on hacks is located on the ground floor of the Stata Center, near the cafeteria at the southeastern end of the complex, and may be viewed by visitors during normal office hours.\n\nFamous hacks include a weather balloon labeled \"MIT\" appearing at the 50-yard line at the Harvard/Yale football game in 1982, the placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome, converting the Great Dome into R2-D2 or a large yellow ring to acknowledge the release of \"\" and \"\" respectively, or placing full-sized replicas of the Wright Flyer and a fire truck to acknowledge the anniversaries of first powered controlled flight and the September 11th attacks respectively.\n\nAt MIT, the terms \"hack\" and \"hacker\" have many shades of meaning, though they are closely linked historically and culturally with computer hacking (in its original non-computer-cracker sense), collegiate practical jokes, and even culture jamming. The origin of this usage is unknown, but it seems to have been widespread at MIT by the 1960s, and the hacker ethic has since spread into cyberculture and beyond. Over time, the term has been generalized to describe anybody who possesses great technical proficiency in any particular skill, usually combined with an offbeat sense of humor. The manifestation of hacker culture in the form of spectacular pranks is the most visible aspect of this culture to the world at large, but many hacker subcultures exist at MIT, and elsewhere. This article focuses mostly on prankish aspects; for a fuller description of hacker culture, see \"Hacker (term)\".\n\nRoof and tunnel hacking, a form of urban exploration, is also related to but not identical to \"hacking\" as described in this article. Some hacks do involve overcoming barriers to physical access (e.g. placing a half-scale Apollo Lunar Module atop the Great Dome), but many other stunts do not require such specialized skills.\n\nViewed from an anthropological perspective, hacking is a cultural tradition affirming group solidarity, but some hacks can also be viewed as individualistic creative or artistic expression. For example the \"Massachusetts Toolpike\" hack was a clear instance of installation art or environmental art. Hacks which involve staged public actions (e.g. a zombie march or the Time Traveler Convention of 2005) are clearly a form of performance art, often combined with body art and cosplay. Still other hacks have a strong conceptual art flavor, often satirizing other purported works of conceptual art. Sometimes the boundaries have been deliberately blurred, for example when a satirical work of \"conceptual art\" (\"No Knife: a study in mixed media earth tones, number three\") was surreptitiously added to a \"serious\" art gallery show at the List Visual Arts Center.\n\n\"Tribute\", \"memorial\", or \"commemorative\" hacks note the arrival, passing, or anniversary of some noteworthy person, tradition, institution, or idea (e.g. the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia). Another broad category of hacks contains strong elements of social commentary or street protest (e.g. \"Nth Annual Spontaneous Tuition Riot\") about events on campus or in the world at large. But the strongest element of many hacks is the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective engineering, both technical and social (e.g. installing a full-sized mockup solar-powered subway car on the parapet wall around the base of the Great Dome, and then \"driving it back and forth under remote wireless control\" from Killian Court, some five stories below, \"after sundown\").\nLike most art exhibitions, the great majority of hacks are temporary installations; most are removed within a day or so by MIT Physical Plant, the MIT Confined Space Rescue Team (CSRT), or occasionally by the hackers themselves. It is a traditional courtesy to leave a note or even engineering drawings behind, as an aid to safe de-installation of a hack. Sometimes, the hacks have been de-installed so quickly that members of the MIT community and the general public have had little opportunity to view them. On very rare occasions, community protests have caused the MIT administration to quietly allow a hack to be re-installed and left for a proper viewing interval. The results of certain hacks (often wall murals) have been considered \"permanent improvements\" to the campus environment, and have been left in place indefinitely, most notably the \"Smoot marks\" on the Harvard Bridge. The MIT Museum maintains an extensive collection of original hacker artifacts and documentation, and displays some larger items semi-permanently in the Stata Center.\n\nAlthough many traditional college pranks have involved maximizing embarrassment or inconvenience for a victim or target, such antics are usually disparaged by MIT hackers as \"unimaginative\" or \"boring\". Often the target of a hack is an abstract concept (e.g. bureaucracy or \"political correctness\", or entropy), and the prank may or may not be aimed at any specific individual. Even when an individual is targeted (e.g. the \"disappearing office\" of newly arrived MIT President Charles Vest), the jest is good-natured, often eliciting admiration rather than anger from the \"victim\".\n\nWriters for the third-party, independent Internet prankster site \"Zug\" once compared humorous responses at MIT and Harvard, by posting similar banners over main entrances to their respective campuses which proclaimed \"Institute of Nowlege\". Regarding Harvard, they concluded, \"The question: is the sense of humor still alive in modern-day Harvard students? The answer, it turns out, is \"no\".\" Regarding MIT, they said, \"So it's official: MIT students have a better sense of humor, hands down, than Harvard students. MIT students are more imaginative, more fun-loving, and probably smarter as well. Truly, MIT is the Institute of NOWLEGE.\" The \"Zug\" pranksters also noted and documented great differences in the reactions of campus police, maintenance workers, and passersby, upon seeing the ironically punned banners.\n\nMIT hacks can push the limits of technical skill, and sometimes fail in spite of meticulous planning. Even these engineering failures have been acknowledged to have educational value, and sometimes a follow-up attempt succeeds. One hack on the Great Dome is documented as having finally succeeded on the fourth try, after a complete re-engineering of both the installed artifact and the installation method.\n\nSmaller projects that can be completed by an individual student are sometimes accorded the honorific \"a great hack\" by other students, if they combine technical elegance with a hackish sense of humor. For example, an MIT undergrad transformed an ordinary grocery shopping cart into a high-performance electric vehicle, and had been frequently seen riding around campus in his \"LOLrioKart\". The shopping cart had a claimed top speed over , and also had a complex steering wheel linkage and a low turning radius for maneuverability in tight spaces. The student was a strong advocate of the Open Source Hardware philosophy, and incorporated detailed documentation of his projects and a tutorial on building custom wheel hub motors in his blog. The ersatz vehicle was prominently displayed at many MIT events, as well as at the Cambridge Science Festival. As a crowning mark of recognition by the outside world, the LOLrioKart driver once received a traffic ticket from the Cambridge Police, a copy of which was proudly displayed online.\n\nSome of the best large-scale hacks (e.g. the Caltech cannon heist) have involved multiple teams of hackers working on coordinated but diverse subtasks such as fund-raising, \"social engineering\", rigging, transportation logistics, gold electroplating, and precision numerical controlled machining, calling on a wide range of technical and management skills. Not surprisingly, some hacker teams have gone on to found start-up business ventures, though they may be reluctant to reveal their earlier exploits until many years have passed.\n\nOne classic hack involved a police car with its flashing warning lights operating. The unusual aspect of this hack was its position — on top of MIT's Great Dome. The car was found to be a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was pi. Its license plate read \"IHTFP\", the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan. A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside with mug of coffee and a box of donuts. Some years later, the police car has now been semi-permanently re-installed in the Stata Center as an all-time classic.\n\nDue to MIT's proximity to Harvard, many hacks involve the annual Harvard-Yale football game. Because of the Cambridge rivalry between MIT and Harvard, hackers often are found at the games, and they have come up with some of the most famous hacks in the Institute's history.\n\nOne such notable hack attempt targeting the 1948 Harvard-Yale football game involved the use of primer cord. One night shortly before the game MIT students snuck into the Harvard stadium and buried primer cord just under the field. The plan was to burn the letters MIT into the middle of the field during the game. However, their work was uncovered by groundskeepers and disabled. During the game the hackers were apprehended while wearing heavy coats on a fair-weather day. The coats were lined with batteries, obviously intended to be used to detonate the primer cord. An apocryphal story is that an MIT dean came to their defense, opening his own battery-lined coat and claiming that \"all Tech men carry batteries\"; an MIT dean did show up, but he was not wearing batteries. This phrase has since become common among MIT students.\n\nThe Harvard-Yale football game was again the target of MIT hackers in 1982 when a large weather balloon painted with \"MIT\" all around was inflated, seemingly from nowhere, in the middle of the field. The next day the \"Boston Herald\" ran the headline \"MIT 1—Harvard-Yale 0: Tech Pranksters Steal the Show\". The 1982 Harvard-Yale hack earned acclaim as winner of \"Hack Madness\", a March Madness-themed contest sponsored by the MIT Alumni Association in 2014 to determine \"the greatest MIT hack of all time\".\n\nIn 1990 an MIT banner was successfully launched from an end zone using a model rocket engine shortly before Yale attempted a field goal kick. In 1996, the Harvard logos on the scoreboard were hacked from \"VE-RI-TAS\" to read \"HU-GE-EGO\" instead.\n\nAnother traditional hacking target has been the bronze statue of John Harvard, the namesake of Harvard University. The statue itself was sculpted by Daniel Chester French, a respected artist who studied at MIT, who is best known for his statue of \"Abraham Lincoln\" at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. Because of its visible location in Harvard Yard and its symbolic significance, the John Harvard statue has been fitted with an unending sequence of \"accessories\". MIT hackers are hardly alone; Dartmouth College pranksters like to paint the statue green, Yale pranksters prefer blue, and others have dressed the statue in women's underwear. MIT hackers like to go a few steps further, fitting the statue with a plaster leg cast after a crushing football defeat, and disguising the statue as the Unabomber after that infamous Harvard alumnus was arrested. John Harvard has worn a Brass Rat from time to time, and has donned a Halo combat helmet and brandished a Halo assault rifle to mark the release of the \"Halo 3\" first-person shooter video game. In accordance with hacker ethics, great care is taken to ensure that the hacks can be removed without causing permanent damage to Harvard's treasured symbol.\n\nThe cleverness of many MIT hacks has even resulted in urban legends about supposed hacks that may not have occurred. One rumored hack involved a certain student's adherence to classical conditioning behavior response, as studied by Harvard Professor B. F. Skinner. Throughout the off-season, this supposed student visited the Harvard football stadium during his lunch break. He dressed in a black and white striped shirt and trousers, filled his pockets with bird-seed, then went on the field, blew a whistle, and spread his birdseed on the field. The result of all of this effort, the story goes, is that on opening day as the Harvard football team took the field to face their opponent, the referee blew his whistle to signal the start of the game, and the field was suddenly inundated by a flock of birds looking for their lunch. Despite sounding like a classic MIT hack, this particular prank has never been verified. The author of a 1990 book about pranks pulled by MIT students stated that he had not come across clear documentation of this tale during his years of research.\n\nOn the other hand, at least one hack involved a staged event that never occurred, when hackers convinced major news media that they had created an indoor snowstorm in Baker House dormitory.\n\nWhen MIT replaced older mercury-vapor lamps with high-efficiency LED lamps to illuminate the Great Dome, hackers started changing the color of the lights to reflect various occasions — Earth Day, the Fourth of July, etc. Although reprogramming the lights is technically straightforward, these Great Dome lighting hacks are very visible from Boston's Back Bay district, across the Charles River.\n\nIn September 2011, hackers installed 153 (= 9 x 17) custom-made wirelessly-controlled color-changing high-power LED lights into every window above the first floor of the 295-foot (90 m) tall MIT Green Building. They displayed a waving American flag throughout the evening of September 11, 2011 in remembrance of the September 11 attacks of 2001. For a short time in the early morning of September 12, the lights displayed a Tetris game, thus realizing a long-standing hack proposal, the \"Holy Grail\" of hacks. The display hardware had occasional glitches, and was removed as of September 13. The hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability. On April 20, 2012, MIT hackers successfully turned the Green Building into a huge playable Tetris game, operated from a wireless control podium at a comfortable viewing distance in front of the building. Visitors to Campus Preview Weekend (a gathering for admitted prospective freshman students) were invited to play the game on the colossal display grid (80 ft. wide x 250 ft. high), which was claimed to be the second-largest full-color video display in the US.\n\nInstead of a one-shot temporary installation, the hackers have designed and built a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the EAPS Department, which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window. To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to \"opt out\", each light display is equipped with a manual override button, which will disable the pixel lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released Open Source software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images, in cooperation with the hacker engineers.\n\nIHTFP is an abbreviation which is part of the folklore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It originally stood for \"I Hate This Fucking Place\" but, due to use of profanity, is often euphemized with other backronyms. Some of the more popular meanings include \"I Have The Fucking Power\" (Hacking), \"I Help Tutor Freshman Physics\", \"It's Hard To Fondle Penguins\", \"I'm Hankering To Find Paradise\", and \"Interesting Hacks To Fascinate People\", as well as \"I Have Truly Found Paradise\", \"Institute for Hacks, TomFoolery, and Pranks\" and \"Institute Has The Finest Professors.\" MIT leadership has even adapted the acronym, using it to encourage vaccination during the 2009–2010 flu season with a banner in the MIT medical building that read \"I Hate This Flu Pandemic\". The precise time of origin is unknown, though the term IHTFP was already widely used at MIT by 1960.\n\nThe letters \"IHTFP\" have been featured prominently on some hacks, but are more usually subtly embedded within other hacks as an inside joke. A very common motif in the MIT Brass Rat (class ring) prior to 2013 was the inclusion of the letters \"IHTFP\" hidden somewhere within the frame of the bezel.\n\nThe 2016 celebrations of MIT's 'crossing of the Charles' in 1916, featured a translations as 'I Honor Theory (and) Forgo Practice'. This was part of a play / sketch addressing the friction between theoretical and applied researchers.\n\nMIT and Caltech have been prank rivals since Spring 2005, when a group of Caltech students traveled to Cambridge to pull a string of pranks during \"Campus Preview Weekend\" (CPW) for prospective new MIT students. The stunts included covering up the word \"Massachusetts\" in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the main building façade with a banner, so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology\". A group of MIT hackers quickly responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read \"The Only Institute of Technology\".\n\nMIT students retaliated for CPW in April 2006, when students posing as the \"Howe & Ser Moving Co.\" abducted the 130-year-old, 1.7 ton Fleming House Cannon and moved it to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, thus reprising a similar prank performed by Harvey Mudd College in 1986. To add a technical flourish, a 24K gold-plated precisely upscaled machined replica of the famed Brass Rat (MIT's graduation ring) was tightly fitted over the barrel of the cannon, which was carefully aimed in the direction of Caltech. Twenty-three members of Caltech Fleming House traveled to MIT to reclaim their cannon on April 10, 2006. They were greeted by a larger group of MIT students, who offered them a BBQ farewell party. In exchange, the Caltech students offered a small toy cannon, saying that this was \"more your size\".\n\nDuring MIT's CPW in 2007, Caltech distributed a complete fake edition of \"The Tech\" (MIT's student newspaper) with the headline article reading \"MIT Invents the Interweb\". Another article announced the discovery, \"Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite\", referring to MIT's iconic main thoroughfare. The edition included a mock weather forecast, referring often to how sunny Pasadena (where Caltech is located) is compared to Boston, as well as other satirical articles.\n\nIn 2008, Caltech students provided a \"Puzzle Zero\" in the MIT Mystery Hunt which when solved, told solvers to \"CALL 1-626-848-3780 ASAP\". When MIT students dialed the number, they heard, \"Thank you for calling the Caltech Admissions Office. If you are another MIT student wishing to transfer to Caltech, please download our transfer application form from www.caltech.edu. If you are an MIT student not wishing to transfer to Caltech, we wish you the best of luck, and hope you find happiness someday...\"\n\nAround Thanksgiving weekend in 2009, yet another fake edition of \"The Tech\" was released, alleging that MIT had been sold to Caltech and would become \"Caltech East: School of Humanities\". Students would be required to take a core of literature, history, philosophy, and economics, but science subjects would be eliminated.\n\nIn the past few years, MIT hackers have tended to ignore Caltech \"nuisance\" pranks, instead preferring to perform more imaginatively engineered hacks on their own home campus. In particular, the majority of documented hacks occurring during CPW have been perpetrated by MIT students themselves.\nMIT hackers have only rarely interfered with Caltech traditions, rituals, or celebrations. But some MIT hackers do occasionally engage in low-level \"sniping\" back and forth with Caltech pranksters. For example, hackers made a website http://www.mitrejects.com redirect to Caltech's homepage. Caltech then did the same, with https://web.archive.org/web/20110614193503/http://www.caltechrejects.com/ redirecting to the MIT homepage.\n\nA possible change in attitude started when a TARDIS, which hackers had placed on the MIT Little Dome (August 25, 2010) and the MIT Great Dome (August 30, 2010), was transported to the roof of Baxter Hall at Caltech (January 4, 2011) by MIT and Caltech pranksters, where it remained for several weeks. The traveling time-machine subsequently reappeared atop Birge Hall at the University of California, Berkeley (January 29, 2011), and then rematerialized on the Durand Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering Building at Stanford University (March 18, 2011). The TARDIS came complete with a helpful note explaining how to disassemble it, and suggesting passing it on to other unexplored destinations.\n\nThe MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery website has an extensive but far from complete catalog of past hacks related to MIT, including numerous documentary photos. More-complete coverage, especially of older hacks, appears in the books listed under Further Reading below, but these printed volumes appear only intermittently. The listing here only summarizes a few salient examples from MIT's long tradition of hacking.\n\nIn the early morning of April 26, 2017, recent graduate Nicholas William Paggi died while hacking the Great Dome. According to the MIT newspaper, The Tech, the brilliant computer scientist slipped and fell to his death.\n\nOn the evening of January 10, 2013, Pac-Man and Blinky appeared on the scaffolding covering the Great Dome during reconstruction. According to the MIT alumni blog \"Slice of MIT\", the Pac-Man vs. Blinky battle was intended to serve as a metaphor for the semester. \"Pac-Man represents the unquenchable search for knowledge, while Blinky represents the unforeseen distractions that may occur.\"\n\nAlthough it might not strictly be categorized as a hack, the MIT Gangnam Style parody video released October 27, 2012, was a major student-run project that involved coordinating hundreds of people and over 25 different student organizations. The music video closely follows the original version, and includes cameo appearances by MIT professors Donald Sadoway, recognized by \"Time Magazine\" in 2012 as one of the \"Top 100 Most Influential People in the World\", Eric Lander, who was co-chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and Noam Chomsky, a pioneer of modern linguistics. The parody quickly reached #1 most popular video in Entertainment and #6 overall on YouTube, was called the \"Best Gangnam Style Parody Yet\" by \"The Huffington Post\", and got an enthusiastic reaction from Psy, the star and producer of the original video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Coleman\n\nJohn (Jack) Cristopher Coleman (died 20 April 1971) was a respected Irish geographer, archaeologist, speleologist and mountaineer. He devoted much of his life to the study of the caves of Ireland, the product of which were his many contributions to scientific journals in Ireland and the United Kingdom, his founding of the Speleological Society of Ireland and the publishing of his book, \"The Caves of Ireland\".\n\nHis dedication to the exploration of Irish caves and highly respected articles published both nationally and abroad were pivotal in boosting the study of speleology in Ireland during the mid to late 20th century, earning him the affectionate title of the \"father of Irish caving\".\n\nColeman was born in Cork, Ireland and worked for Bord Fáilte from 1945, having trained as a geographer in Cork University. He began caving in 1932, initially exploring caves within cycling distance of his home in Cork City such as Carrigtwohill Caves and Ovens Caves. In 1940 Coleman met Portlaoise textile chemist N. J. Dunnington, who joined him in explorations of caves in South Cork. In July 1941 the pair cycled heavily laden bicycles to County Clare to investigate Pollnagollum, and over the ensuing years undertook a systematic exploration of the cave system. In 1944 the Royal Irish Academy published an article on the cave system by Coleman and Dunnington, which received widespread praise from the scientific community and attracted a new wave of speleologists to the Burren.\n\nColeman was the first speleologist to identify scalloping as an indicator of the direction of water flow in a cave. His findings, made between 1946 and 1949, were published by the University of Bristol Spelæological Society (UBSS). Coleman would later cite the relationship that he built with the society over the following years to be a major stimulus in continuing his work on Irish caves, and ultimately in completing his book on the subject. By the 1960s he had been made Honorary Life Member of the UBSS.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Coleman carried out much scientific fieldwork in areas such as Counties Sligo, Monaghan and Kerry, and the Cong region, which would pave the way for further discoveries by local and visiting speleologists.\n\nIn 1964 Coleman founded the Speleological Society of Ireland, the first representative body for cavers in Ireland. He was also the first editor of the Society's journal \"Irish Speleology\". Coleman published his work widely in a number of publications. His articles included work on Dunmore Cave, Carrigtwohill Caves and Pollnagollum, but it was not until 1965 that his seminal work, \"The Caves of Ireland\", was published. Originally written by Coleman as his MA thesis at Cork University, the book was the first and currently only publication to comprehensively list and describe cave sites throughout Ireland.\n\nColeman was also a prominent member of the Irish Mountaineering Club and was president of the club from 1950–1953.\n\nColeman was killed in a car accident on 20 April 1971, at the age of 57. He was survived by his wife, son and three daughters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "215670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215670", "title": "Lil' Kim", "text": "Lil' Kim\n\nKimberly Denise Jones (born July 11, 1974 or 1975), known professionally by her stage name Lil' Kim, is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, model, and actress. She was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, living much of her adolescent life on the streets after being expelled from home. In her teens, Jones would freestyle rap, heavily influenced by fellow female hip-hop artists like MC Lyte and The Lady of Rage. In 1994, she was discovered by fellow rapper The Notorious B.I.G., who invited her to join his rap group Junior M.A.F.I.A.; their debut album as a group, \"Conspiracy\", generated two top 20 singles in the United States and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nLil' Kim's debut studio album, \"Hard Core\" (1996), was certified double platinum by the RIAA, has since sold more than 6 million copies worldwide, and spawned three successful singles: \"No Time\", \"Not Tonight (Ladies Night)\", and \"Crush on You\". Her following albums, \"The Notorious K.I.M.\" (2000) and \"La Bella Mafia\" (2003), were also certified platinum, making her the only female rapper besides Missy Elliott and Nicki Minaj to have at least three platinum-certified studio albums. In 2001, she was featured on the single \"Lady Marmalade\" (a remake of the 1975 hit single of the same name, originally recorded by LaBelle), alongside Mýa, Pink and Christina Aguilera, which went to number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In addition, the remake won two MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year, and a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Grammy Awards in 2002. In 2005, she served a yearlong prison sentence for lying to a jury about her friends' involvement in a shooting four years earlier. During her incarceration, her fourth album, \"The Naked Truth\", was released to positive reviews from critics. She returned to the public eye in 2009 with an appearance on \"Dancing with the Stars\".\n\nThroughout her career, Lil' Kim has sold more than 15 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide. Her songs \"No Time\", \"Big Momma Thang\", and \"Ladies Night\" were listed on \"Complex Magazine\"'s list of the 50 Best Rap Songs By Women. In 2012, Lil' Kim was listed on VH1's 100 Greatest Women In Music list at number 45, the second highest position for a solo female hip-hop artist. Lil' Kim has been called \"the fiercese, most provocative and most infamous female rapper\" by AllMusic, and one of the top 50 greatest MCs of all time in the book \"There's a God on the Mic\". Aside from music, Lil' Kim is also known for her risk-taking and luxurious approach to fashion that inspired many artists; she has been cited as a fashion icon. She has been called one of the most influential rappers of all time, often referred to as the \"Queen of Rap\" and \"Hip-Hop Goddess\".\n\nJones was born in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the second child of Linwood Jones, a former U.S. Marine, and Ruby Jones (later Ruby Jones-Mitchell). She has one older brother named Christopher. As a child, Jones attended Queen of All Saints Elementary School in Brooklyn. At the age of 9, her parents separated, and Jones was raised by her father, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship. After being kicked out of her house by her father, Jones dropped out of high school and started living out on the streets.\n\nWhile still a teen, Jones met The Notorious B.I.G. a.k.a. Biggie Smalls (real name Christopher Wallace), who was a key figure in both her personal and artistic life, particularly after Wallace gained popularity and influence through his relationship with Bad Boy Records, founded by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs. Jones attended Sarah J. Hale Vocational High School for two and a half years. Many of her friends also went there and she would often skip school to hang out with them. Since her school work wasn't being completed, the decision was made for her to transfer to Brooklyn College Academy to finish her remaining year and half of school. It was the same school that fellow rappers Nas and Foxy Brown also attended.\n\nIn 1994, B.I.G. was instrumental in introducing and promoting the Brooklyn-based group, Junior M.A.F.I.A., which included Jones, who adopted the stage name Lil' Kim and was only 19 at the time. The group's first and only album, \"Conspiracy\", was released to mediocre reviews and moderate sales on August 29, 1995 and debuted at number eight on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 69,000 copies in its first week of release. Wallace wrote (and ghostwrote) most of the album's material. Three hit singles came from \"Conspiracy\": \"Player's Anthem\", \"I Need You Tonight\", and \"Get Money\". The RIAA certified \"Conspiracy\" gold on December 6, 1995. \"Player's Anthem\" and \"Get Money\" were certified gold and platinum respectively. Lil' Kim's increasing popularity as a member of Junior M.A.F.I.A. allowed her to start a solo career shortly after the \"Conspiracy\" album was released, and she began working on what would become her debut album \"Hard Core\" by late 1995.\n\nAfter a year with Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lil' Kim began a solo career by making guest performances on R&B albums and recording her debut album, \"Hard Core\", which was released in November 1996. The album debuted at number 11 on the \"Billboard\" 200, the highest debut for a female rap album at that time, and number 3 on \"Billboard\"s Top R&B Albums, selling 78,000 copies in its first week of release and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. \"Hard Core\" was certified double platinum by the RIAA on March 14, 2001 after having been certified gold on January 6, 1997 and platinum on June 3, 1997. The album's lead single \"No Time\", a duet with Combs (who would later change his stage name to \"P. Diddy\" and then \"Diddy\"), reached the top spot of the \"Billboard\" Hot Rap Tracks chart and was certified gold by the RIAA. The following single, \"Crush on You\", reached number 6 on the Hot 100 and number 2 on the rap chart. A remix of the album's track \"Not Tonight\" saw Lil' Kim team up with Missy Elliott, Angie Martinez, Da Brat and Left Eye of TLC. The song was part of the soundtrack to the Martin Lawrence movie \"Nothing to Lose\", nominated for a Grammy Award, and certified platinum. In one stockholders' meeting of Warner Bros. Records, activist C. Delores Tucker criticized the label \"for producing this filth,\" referring to perceived graphic sexual content in Lil' Kim's lyrics, and labeling them \"gangsta porno rap\". In 1997, Lil' Kim promoted \"Hard Core\" by performing on P. Diddy's \"No Way Out\" tour. The tour continued through to 1998 and became one of the highest grossing hip-hop tours of all time, grossing an estimated $16 million. That same year, she launched her own label Queen Bee Entertainment. From 1998 to 2000, Lil' Kim continued her road to stardom under the management of B.I.G.'s best friend, Damion \"D-Roc\" Butler's \"Roc Management\", touring and modeling for various fashion and pop culture companies including Candie's, Versace, Iceberg, and Baby Phat. and even though she had not had an album of her own released, she was seen on dozens of remixes and guest appearances on other artist's records.\n\nOn June 27, 2000, Lil' Kim released her second album \"The Notorious K.I.M.\" The album marked a new image and revamped look for the rapper. Despite the limited success of its singles, the album debuted at number 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, selling 229,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum by the RIAA, four weeks after its release. It was on this LP that the well-known hip-hop feud between Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown escalated. In 2001, Lil' Kim teamed up with Christina Aguilera, Pink, and Mýa to remake \"Lady Marmalade\", which was originally written about a bordello in New Orleans and performed by the group Labelle (which included diva Patti LaBelle) 25 years earlier. The song was recorded for the \"Moulin Rouge!\" film soundtrack, released in April 2001, and stayed number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for five weeks. The song also went to number 1 in 50 countries around the world. This was a big accomplishment for female rap, as well as for Lil' Kim, who scored her first number 1 Hot 100 hit and became the second solo female rapper in history to hit number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts. \"Lady Marmalade\" also garnered Lil' Kim her first Grammy Award. The second single, \"Kimnotyze\", was released as the lead single of record producer DJ Tomekk's compilation album \"Beat Of Life, Vol 1\". It was released in Switzerland, Austria and Germany only. The song was successful, becoming Lil' Kim's third consecutive top 10 hit in Germany after her number 5 hit \"Lady Marmalade\".\n\nIn 2002, Lil' Kim recorded a new entrance theme for then World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Women's Champion Trish Stratus entitled, \"Time to Rock 'n Roll\", which was used during broadcasts, until Stratus' retirement. The single was released on \"WWE Anthology\", a compilation of entrance theme music to various professional wrestling superstars. Lil' Kim released the buzz song \"Whats The Word\" in mid-2002. Despite not having an official release, it went on to peak at number 9 on the Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. It would later be released on the Japan edition of her third studio album, La Bella Mafia, as a bonus track.\n\nOn March 4, 2003, Lil' Kim released her third studio album, \"La Bella Mafia\". It debuted at number 5 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 166,000 copies in its first week, giving Lil' Kim her second consecutive top 5 album. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, receiving a score of 65 on Metacritic. A buzz single, \"Came Back For You\", was released ahead of the album, the music video for the song featured reality television personality Victoria Gotti. The first single, \"The Jump Off\", featuring Mr. Cheeks, peaked at number 16 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Follow up single, \"Magic Stick\", featuring 50 Cent, peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, staying there for three weeks. The song never had a commercial release or a music video, but was successful due to high radio airplay, peaking at number one on the \"Billboard\" Airplay chart. A third US only single, \"Thug Luv\", featuring Twista, was released in the last quarter of 2003 at peaked at number 60 on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album was certified platinum in the US, selling over 1.1 million copies. Lil' Kim promoted the album with a string of concerts, which also featured DMX and Nas. Lil' Kim was nominated for five Source Awards and won two (\"Female Hip-Hop Artist of the Year\", and \"Female Single of the Year\"). The album also got two Grammy Award nominations for Best Female Rap Solo Performance (\"Came Back For You\") and Best Rap Collaboration (\"Magic Stick\"). She was also nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with singer Christina Aguilera for the song \"Can't Hold Us Down\", from Aguilera's album \"Stripped\".\n\nGreg Thomas, an English professor at Syracuse University, began teaching \"Hip-Hop Eshu: Queen B@#$H Lyricism 101\". Lil' Kim herself was a guest speaker at the school. Professor Thomas considered Lil' Kim's lyrics \"the art with the most profound sexual politics I've ever seen anywhere.\" David Horowitz criticized the course as \"academic degeneracy and decline\". Lil' Kim also made an appearance on the multi-platform videogame \".\" Lil' Kim provided voice-overs for her part in the storyline, where the player may fight an opponent to have Lil' Kim as their girlfriend. In 2004, Lil' Kim recorded a cover of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" which was used as the opening theme for Victoria Gotti's reality series Growing Up Gotti. The same year Lil' Kim was featured on the remix of \"Naughty Girl\" by Beyoncé. In December 2004, Lil' Kim began recording a pilot for a VH1 reality show titled \"718 Makeover\". The 718 in the title is the area code for Brooklyn, where Lil' Kim grew up. The show never made it to air.\n\nOn March 17, 2005, Lil' Kim was convicted of three counts of conspiracy and one count of perjury for lying to a Federal grand jury about her and her friends' involvement in a 2001 shooting outside the Hot 97 studios in Manhattan. During the trial of her co-manager, Damion \"D-Roc\" Butler, and her bodyguard, Suif \"Gutta\" Jackson, a former member of the hip-hop group Junior M.A.F.I.A, she testified not to have known they were at the scene. However, video footage from a security camera placed all three at the scene, exiting the building. This directly contravened testimony before the grand jury. Butler and Jackson have since pleaded guilty to gun charges. Jackson was sentenced, in U.S. District Court, to twelve years in federal prison as part of plea bargain in which he admitted to firing at least twenty rounds during the incident. The length of the sentence was said to have been influenced by his previous gun-related convictions. In July 2005, Lil' Kim was sentenced to a one-year and a day in prison, thirty days home detention upon release from custody, and three years of probation. She served the entirety of her sentence at the Federal Detention Center, Philadelphia in Center City, Philadelphia. She was released on July 3, 2006, after serving approximately 12 months. Lil' Kim, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Register #56198-054, was released from BOP supervision on August 2, 2006.\n\nLil' Kim released her fourth album, \"The Naked Truth\", on September 27, 2005, while serving a federal prison sentence. It earned her a 5 mic rating from \"The Source\", making her the only female rapper to ever receive a 5 mic rating. The album debuted at number 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 109,000 copies in its first week of release, giving Lil' Kim her third top 10 debut on the chart. \"The Naked Truth\" did not sell as well as her previous works, it only managed to reach a gold certification by RIAA. She said that her prison sentence left her with no time to promote the project. The music video for \"The Naked Truth\" first single, \"Lighters Up\", was number one on BET's \"106 & Park\" for two weeks. \"Lighters Up\" was a Top Ten hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. The single also reached number. 67 on the German Single Chart, number 12 on the UK Top 75 and number 4 on the Finland Single Chart. The second single, \"Whoa\" was released on February 17, 2006. It reached number 22 on Airplay.\n\nOn March 9, 2006, BET premiered the show \"\", which was filmed before Lil' Kim headed to prison. The show became the highest rated premiere in BET history, averaging 1.9 million viewers. In May 2006, Debbie Harry released a song in tribute to Lil' Kim called \"Dirty and Deep\" in protest of her conviction. The song was available for free from her official website. \"The Dance Remixes\", her first compilation album was released on June 6, 2006. The album featured remixes of songs from \"The Naked Truth\" and \"Hard Core\". A limited pressing released only in the US, it received no promotion, due to Lil' Kim being in prison at the time of release, and failed to chart.

After a couple of months of seeing each other, Powell was arrested for robbery and was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. Jones and Powell continued their relationship with Jones visiting frequently and also kept in touch by writing letters to each other. The couple also became engaged while he was incarcerated. During this time was when Jones met Christopher Wallace, and with wanting to focus on starting her rap career the engagement was eventually called off and the couple split. Shortly after meeting Wallace, Jones had an on and off relationship with him up until his death in 1997. On July 23, 1996, Jones was arrested for possession of marijuana after police raided the Teaneck, New Jersey home of Wallace. The arrest came after police smelt marijuana inside the home when they went to ask for someone to move an illegally parked car. Jones denied she was smoking, claiming she was \"upstairs all day sleeping\". That same year, during the recording of her debut album, Jones fell pregnant with Wallace's child. Jones never made it public until 1999 during an interview with \"The Source\". Jones decided not to keep the baby, telling \"The Source\" \"I already knew the kind of relationship that Biggie and I had, and I knew that [having a child] was something that couldn't take place...\" Wallace called Jones three days before his death and told her he loved her. In 2017, Jones admitted her relationship with Wallace was \"very violent\" after Jermaine Dupri claimed that he witnessed Wallace pull a pistol out on Jones. She had previously revealed that he was physically abusive and he once choked her until she passed out.\n\nOn March 17, 1999, Teaneck police issued an arrest warrant after Jones failed to turn up to court dates stemming from her 1996 arrest. The warrant wasn't a top priority for police and wasn't made public until September 2003, after the story was published online by The Smoking Gun. Jones was later removed from Teaneck's wanted list in October 2003, after $350 in bail was posted on her behalf. Jones' attorney told reporters that she didn't appear in court as she believed the case had been resolved.\n\nIn 2002, Jones started dating Damion \"World\" Hardy; the couple split in 2003. It was during this time that Jones had been a victim of physical abuse. Jones also stated how she had to have multiple nose jobs due to being punched. On June 20, 2003, Jones had $250,000 worth of jewelry stolen from her while catching a flight at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after a bag, which she intended to carry on, was mixed up with eight other pieces of her luggage. The missing jewelry was recovered 10 days later, found wrapped up in a rag in a locker room for airline employees by a United Airlines worker. On July 1, 2003, John Acheson was charged after trying to extort $25,000 from Jones in exchange for her stolen jewelry. Acheson, who was never in possession of Jones' jewelry, called Jones' lawyer, Mel Sachs, on June 23 saying he had the jewelry and would exchange it for an initial $5,000 and $20,000 at a later date. Acheson was charged with third degree attempted grand larceny, fourth degree attempted grand larceny by extortion, and attempted coercion in the second degree. In March 2004, Acheson was sentenced to five days in jail and a $500 fine after pleading guilty to a minor charge of attempted grand larceny. In 2004, Jones dated record producer Scott Storch. The two met when Storch offered Jones a ride to her hotel. The couple split after only 2 months together. In 2013, Storch revealed that he would've married Jones if the relationship had worked out. In 2007, Jones and Ray J briefly dated. On June 9, 2014, Jones gave birth to a baby girl, named Royal Reign.

In 1995, they collaborated with Da Brat for the remix of \"No One Else\" by Total. The following year, they were featured in the Hot 97 NY Fashion Show, and additionally appeared on the covers of \"The Source\" and \"Vibe\". However, their first dispute developed after both of their debut studio albums were scheduled for release a week apart in November 1996. Media outlets additionally noted similarities between the sleeve covers of Lil' Kim' \"Hard Core\" and Brown's \"Ill Na Na\", where the two were shown wearing the same outfit. In 1997, the feud led to the deterioration of their friendship, and also resulted in the cancellation of a collaborative album \"Thelma & Louise\". Brown noted that the breakdown of their relationship was influenced by their conflicting entourages. They first attempted a reconciliation in 1998 after Lil' Kim called Brown and her mother after the two were held at gunpoint during a house burglary.\n\nIn January 1999, critics noted the track \"My Life\" from Brown's second studio effort \"Chyna Doll\" for being an \"open appeal\" to Brown's friendship with Lil' Kim, in which she cited the relationship being \"lost for pride\", but also contradicted herself after making attacks on \"pointed mistresses\". Critics indicated the records were in subtle use to diss Lil' Kim, especially since during this time, Brown had been supporting Lil' Kim' rival Faith Evans in multiple interviews. In February 1999, a significant part of the media took note of Brown \"suddenly sound[ing] 'exactly' like Lil' Kim\". In late May 1999, Lil' Cease's \"Play Around\", featuring Lil' Kim and Diddy, was released to radio airwaves and was set to be featured on Cease's debut \"The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo\". In the song, after Lil' Kim' guest rap, Diddy recites: \"Stop trying to sound like her too bitches\"; a subliminal diss aimed at Foxy. The line spurred enough controversy that various media sources went on to remark: \"It's finally coming out. Foxy Brown bites worse than a pit bull.\" Additionally, Lil' Kim' guest appearance on Mobb Deep's \"Quiet Storm (Remix)\" and her second album's title track, \"The Notorious K.I.M.\", were released as diss records to Foxy Brown. Angered by Lil' Kim' response, Brown collaborated with longtime associates Capone-N-Noreaga on the track, \"Bang, Bang.\" In the track, Brown mimicked Lil' Kim' interpolation of MC Lyte's \"10% Dis,\" and went on to recite: \"You and Diddy y'all kill me with that subliminal shit.\" Towards the ending of her verse, Brown attacked Lil' Kim' grieving for the loss of Biggie Smalls by remarking: \"Let the nigga [Biggie] rest in peace, and hop off his dick, bitch do you.\"\n\nOn February 26, 2001, at 3 p.m., when Lil' Kim had left New York radio station Hot 97, a shooting broke out; over twenty shots were fired between two groups of three men. One of the men in the groups was Capone, one-half member of Capone-N-Noreaga, who was entering the Hot 97 building in promotion of interviewer DJ Clue's new album, \"The Professional 2\", which happened to have also featured Lil' Kim. An affiliate, Efrain Ocasio, from Capone's entourage was shot in the back; both parties from Lil' Kim and Capone denied any involvement in the shooting. However, a motive behind the shooting was later determined; detectives informed \"The New York Daily News\" that it was a result of the verses Foxy Brown recited in \"Bang, Bang.\"\n\nShaken up by the incident, Brown tried to reach out to Lil' Kim in hopes of settling a truce. Brown stated, \"I really don't know how it started. But Russell [Simmons] and I, we got together, and I said, 'Russell, I want to call a truce.' I want to have a sit-down with Kim. I don't care what it is. Let's just end it. We can even do a collaboration. We're bigger than this. If it has to start with me, let it start with me.\" Brown even extended an olive branch to Lil' Kim' camp, however Lil' Kim had cut all ties with Diddy and Bad Boy associates and wanted no communication with Brown whatsoever. On July 6, 2005, Lil' Kim was sentenced to prison for three counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy.\n\nDuring the 4-year span leading up to Lil' Kim's sentencing, Brown and Lil' Kim began to exchange subtle diss records towards each other, among them included Lil' Kim' \"La Bella Mafia\", \"Quiet\", and \"Guess Who's Back\"; and in turn, Brown's \"\" and various mixtape freestyles. In the midst of the diss records, Brown was interviewed by Doug Banks in 2003 to disclose any further details pertaining to her dispute with Lil' Kim. Brown claimed that Lil' Kim was allegedly jealous that Biggie was to include Brown in his Junior Mafia collective. Brown also added that a tell-all book disclosing the feud would be released in Christmas of 2003. In her final regards to the dispute, Brown stated: \"Kim is the only female artist that keeps me on my toes. She's the only one that I can look at; and any other artist that says they don't have that one person that keeps them driven... is lying.\"\n\nFollowing her release from prison, Lil' Kim no longer acknowledged Brown. Brown, on the other hand, has consistently targeted Lil' Kim as a prime basis in her music and concert venues since Lil' Kim' prison release.\n\nOn May 17, 2012, Lil' Kim attended an interview with radio show, \"The Breakfast Club\". When asked about whether or not she had spoken to Brown at all in recent years, Lil' Kim replied, \"I don't even know her. And when I say that; I don't know who she is to these days. I wouldn't even know what her voice sounds like.\"\n\nLil' Kim has been embroiled in a feud with rapper Nicki Minaj since Minaj dissed Lil' Kim in a track titled \"Hoodstars\", which was released in 2003. With Lil' Kim and media critics noticing resemblances with her on the \"Sucka Free\" mixtape, Lil' Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, \"If you are going to steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me.\" Minaj's single \"Roman's Revenge\" with Eminem was believed by critics to be a response to Lil' Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview on The Angie Martinez show saying \"She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj\", said Minaj. \"Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on \"Billboard\", that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch.\"\n\nLil' Kim reignited the feud following the release of her mixtape \"Black Friday\", an album that directly referenced Nicki Minaj, via her debut album title and songs such as \"Did It On'em\" (that became \"Pissin' On'em\"); and with artwork that showed Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of Minaj's diss track \"Tragedy\" was released online in April 2011, featuring lyrics \"Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal.\" Following the release of Minaj's second album, \"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded\", critics suggested that the tracks \"Stupid Hoe\" may have contained attacks at Lil' Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with \"105's Breakfast Club\" that the song \"\" from Minaj's second album was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj \"obnoxious\" and \"catty\".\n\nThroughout her career, Lil' Kim has earned numerous honors and awards. Lil' Kim's debut album \"Hard Core\" was certified double platinum by the RIAA, and is considered a classic hip-hop album. As of 2007, Lil' Kim has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Her songs \"No Time\", \"Big Momma Thang\" and \"Ladies Night\" were listed on Complex Magazine's \"The 50 Best Rap Songs By Women\", at number 24, 13, and 7, respectively. Her song \"Lady Marmalade\" with Pink, Christina Aguilera, and Mýa, is one of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide, with sales of over 5.1 million worldwide. \"Lady Marmalade\" went number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making her the first female rapper to have a number one on that chart. The song won a 2002 Grammy Award in the category of \"Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals\".\n\nLil' Kim was ranked as one of the top 50 greatest MCs of all time in Kool Moe Dee's 2003 book, \"There's a God on the Mic\".

According to Tribal records, she was the daughter of Will and Caroline Cornsilk Axe.\n\nIn Cherokee culture, a beloved woman is someone who has a lot of influence in the tribe, speaks in tribal meetings, and corresponds with Beloved Women from other indigenous nations. Wachacha was honored as a Beloved Woman by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and Cherokee Nation in 2001 for her work as a clerk in the tribal council, and she was the second woman to be honored in this way. She received the North Carolina Distinguished woman awarded from Governor Jim Martin in 1986. She was one of five to win the award out of the 91 nominated.\n\nWachacha was born and raised in Snowbird Gap in Graham County, North Carolina. Her home was rather isolated in comparison to where the majority of other Cherokee people lived which was about 50 miles away from the Qualla Boundary of Swain County, North Carolina. In Wachacha's youth, European-Americans made many efforts to assimilate Cherokee people into mainstream culture. These efforts led to her going to Christian church every Sunday. Wachacha learned that \"the mountains and the valleys were not formed by the Great buzzards wings but by God.\" Wachacha liked learning about the Bible, the stories in it, and Jesus, but this did not stop her from feeling connected to Cherokee culture. Cherokee was the language spoken in Wachacha's home while growing up. Additionally, Wachacha taught herself to read and write in Cherokee at the age of seven using chalk and writing in the dirt. Moreover, Wachacha attended an English speaking school for four months out of the year until she reached the fourth grade. According to anthropologist Sharlotte Nealy, white teachers and boarding schools were forced on the Cherokee people in order to weaken and eliminate Cherokee culture while promoting American culture. Wachacha's grandson remembers Wachacha talking about her elder's experiences with the Trail of Tears. Not many Cherokee people wrote about this horrific journey; but nonetheless, this did not erase the Trail of Tears from the Cherokee historical memory through word of mouth. Wachacha's ancestors were some of the few Cherokee that were able to remain in North Carolina and avoid forced removal to Indian Territory.\n\nWachacha was a clerk for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Tribal Council for nearly 50 years. She began her tenure as clerk in 1937. There has been no evidence that Wachacha left behind any published works outside of the minutes she wrote as a clerk. Wachacha spoke Cherokee, and there are conflicting accounts as to whether or not she spoke English. Wachacha taught a Cherokee Indian class at Zion Hill Baptist Church. Along with teaching at the Zion Hill Baptist Church, she taught Cherokee culture and language at Robbinsville school system, Tri-County Technical College, and Adult Education Program of Graham County.\n\nWachacha was also known for her skills in being a midwife, herbalist, translator, and public speaker. Over the course of her life as a midwife, Wachacha helped deliver over 3,000 babies. To relieve pain, Wachacha would give mothers in labor tea from the inner bark of the wild black cherry. She regularly walked great distances to help any woman that was in need of her services.\n\nAs a part of Cherokee council member and Beloved Woman, Wachacha attended Cherokee singing ceremonies wearing the customary red Cherokee woman's handkerchief. This singing was the annual Trail of Tears Singing which was incorporated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians from the Western Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. The Trail of Tears Singing was used to create solidarity between the Cherokee Bands and foster ideals of Cherokee traits and identity.\n\nMaggie met and married Jarrett Wachacha in 1935. Jarrett was 20 years older than Maggie, and he was a member of the Deer Clan. Maggie and Jarrett had their first child, Winona, in 1936.\n"}
{"id": "32134569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32134569", "title": "Michael (Nikita character)", "text": "Michael (Nikita character)\n\nMichael Bishop is a fictional character of the CW television series \"Nikita\", portrayed by Shane West. He is the primary romantic interest to Nikita.\n\nLittle is actually known about his past; but flashbacks show Michael was originally a U.S. Navy intelligence officer (although Season 1 episode \"Covenant\" depicts him in Marine uniform), working primarily in the United Arab Emirates. He was also a dedicated family man; with a wife, Elizabeth, and young daughter, Hayley.\n\nIn 2001, while in Yemen, Iraq; Michael was running a \"low-level snitch\"; Kasim Tariq, who was feeding Michael information from inside Al-Qaeda, and was on friendly terms with him. Kasim attempted to kill him with a car bomb placed in a briefcase, supposedly filled with stolen documents, that was in Michael's car. Instead, Michael stepped outside, leaving the briefcase in the car with his family, and realized too late Kasim had betrayed him – the bomb detonated and the car exploded; instantly killing Elizabeth and Hayley, but Michael, unharmed, was knocked out by the blast.\n\nNo sooner had he regained consciousness after the incident, Michael, recovering in a hospital bed and emotionally destroyed by the loss of his family, immediately attempted suicide with pain medication – Percy Rose, however, enters and recruited him into Division; hoping Division will assist him in locating Kasim and Michael would get an opportunity to get revenge. Michael accepted and was given the position as second-in-command and head of agent operations at Division; this cemented the relationship between Percy and Michael. Michael almost achieved this in \"One Way\", Michael plans to stab Tariq with a shiv in a public airport after assistance from Nikita, unbeknownst to her. Nikita foils this plan to save his own life.\n\nIn 2011, Michael finally joined Nikita and her cause after finding out the true reasons behind the death of his family – Kasim only posed as a snitch, and was truly an NOC Division agent; the death of his family was actually due to Percy, the man who saved his life, who had persuaded Kasim that Michael would be an ideal target to gain the approval from Al-Qaeda. Kasim was then killed by Nikita. Upon learning this, Michael, his faith in everything except his feelings for Nikita shattered, joins Nikita's growing anti-Division team – they also succumb to their feelings and become lovers. Together, he continues with them on her mission to search of a way to bring down Division.\n\nAt the start of the story arc concerning Tariq, Michael originally believes that they were killed by Tariq so that he could enter Al Qaeda, having been told so by Percy. Percy and Michael met as Michael was trying to commit suicide, by an overdose of morphine, but is stopped by Percy, who instead persuades him to join him at Division.\nMichael then agrees, and takes up the position of a high-ranking agent due to his military training. He receives the job of greeting new recruits, processing them when they are first taken out of prison. He meets both Nikita and Alex this way. Michael discovers that the death of his family was actually due to the man who saved his life (Percy), who persuaded Tariq that Michael would be an ideal target to gain the approval from Al-Qaeda. Upon learning this, Michael joins Nikita in her search for Percy's secret-containing black boxes.\n\nMichael is introverted in his relationships and is shown to have a closer circle of associates than the other agents. He is, however, shown to be friends with the likes of Seymour Birkhoff and Alex.\n\nConcerning his relationship with Nikita, he seems to not completely understand her intentions (both past and present) when they work together. It is ambiguous to Michael as to why Nikita acted the way she did in saving him from being killed by Kasim Tariq's bodyguards.\nIn the episode \"Alexandra\", he questions her about it, claiming that had she never acted he could have gained revenge and expresses anger that she did so, to which Nikita retaliates with, \"What I did I did out of...\" before trailing off (the implication being that she was going to say she did it out of love). Then, when Michael looks at her oddly, she finishes, \"not wanting to see you get hurt.\" In the episode \"Covenants\", Michael leaves Division and joins Nikita. The two have since become romantically involved. In episode \"Looking Glass\", it is learned that Michael fathered a son with Cassandra (played by Helena Mattsson).\n\nMichael was also in charge of processing new recruits, and telling them that they have been taken out of prison and been given a new life by Division. He breaks the news to Alex in the first episode, telling her that the public now will believe her to have committed suicide in prison. As a field agent, he played a similar role to that of Amanda, who were both high-ranking yet with some psychological leanings in their positions.\nIt is also heavily implied that everyone, even Amanda and Percy, in Division know of Michael's implied affair with Nikita. Both Amanda and Percy have mentioned this to him, Percy rather more bluntly and Amanda stating that \"Percy doesn't need to know everything that goes on here.\"\n\nHe also has a platonic relationship with Alex, who is first processed into Division by Michael in the pilot episode, and he instructs her on the training she will receive, thus learning how to properly \"serve her country\". This reflects six years prior, when he instructed Nikita of the same duties. Alex's similarity to Nikita leads Michael to be more protective of her. He later finds out that she is Nikita's mole by matching the sounds of her phone calls to him to the echoes produced by Nikita's apartment. This is how he is able to track Nikita down. Alex, Nikita and Michael work together to track down Percy's black boxes for a very brief length of time towards the end of the first season, Nikita often in this time asking Michael to help Alex out of sticky situations at Divisions that may compromise his cover by doing so.\n\nAs was the character of Nikita as portrayed by Maggie Q, the character of Michael was highly anticipated by fans who had previously watched \"La Femme Nikita\". Part of this anticipation balanced on the idea of Michael and Nikita's romantic relationship (as had been portrayed in most former incarnations of the tale) and if West and Q possessed a good enough chemistry to play the two.\n\nThe character was well received by critics in his own right, yet not as well received by fans of Roy Dupuis' Michael in \"La Femme Nikita\". West stated that, concerning Dupuis, he \"always actually liked his work\" as well as having also been a fan of the original USA Network \"La Femme Nikita\" television series. Regardless of this, the character was generally well received, and West was even more praised for his performance as the first season continued.\n\nWest won the Teen Choice Award for \"Choice TV Actor Action\" in 2011.\n"}

He wrote three book-length exposés regarding those he said were false seers or psychics: \"ESP, Seers & Psychics;\" \"Mediums, Mystics, & The Occult;\" and \"Search For The Soul.\" In the latter book he found no evidence for the existence of the soul. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell who was influenced by Christopher recommended the books \"without reservation.\"\n\nChristopher also debunked parapsychology experiments and experimenters during his lifetime. Ironically, despite his denial of the existence of psychic or paranormal powers, and like fellow magicians Harry Houdini and James Randi, both of whom also worked to expose false psychics and mediums, Christopher was accused by some of using paranormal powers to perform his own magic tricks and illusions.\n\nIn November 2010, Christopher's widow, Maurine Brooks Christopher, published a special edition of \"Houdini: A Pictorial Life\" with Christopher Collection curator.\n\nAt a meeting of the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) in Denver, Colorado in April 2011, Christopher was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.\n\nIn 2012, the book \"Milbourne Christopher: The Man & His Magic,\" was authored by William V. Rauscher.\n\nThe Milbourne Christopher Foundation was established to encourage excellence, originality and leadership in the magical arts and to help keep conjuring on a level with the other most popular entertainment forms – dance, drama, comedy and music. Incorporated in New York State in 1991, the foundation is federally approved as a charitable organization which was financially supported in the past, and so too will be in the future, through her contributions. The board members have changed through the years, as have several of the award judges. Both the officers and award judges donate their services to the foundation.\n\nIt was Mrs. Christopher wish, and the purpose of the foundation, to sponsor annual awards that spotlight the best magic has to offer contemporaneously in performing, writing, publishing and invention. The categories reflect Milbourne Christopher’s diversified career. This includes the areas of\n\nAuthor and/or publisher\nOutstanding illusionist and/or illusion creator\nPromising young magician\nMentalist\nLifetime achievement/master’s award\nAmbassador of Magic\n\nWinners in other areas may be added at the discretion of the judges and not all winner categories are awarded each year. The charter also authorizes the use of the foundation’s resources to keep classic books of magic – such as Christopher’s “Illustrated History of Magic”, “Panorama of Magic” and his biographies of Houdini.\n\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Patriots in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Oregon and has also been a member of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nChung was born in Kingston, Jamaica. He has four brothers and three sisters.\n\nChung lived in Jamaica until he was ten before moving to California, where he attended Rancho Cucamonga High School in Rancho Cucamonga, California; he played football as a safety and wide receiver and was a two-time All-League pick.\n\nChung enrolled at the University of Oregon in 2004. After redshirting in 2004, Chung took over at the \"rover\" position in 2005, ranking second on the team with 91 tackles (5 solo), as he caused a fumble and deflected five passes. He earned All-Pacific-10 Conference honorable mention honors, and a spot on the Sporting News Freshman All-American Team. In 2006, Chung once again earned All-Pac-10 honorable mention, finishing third on the team with 84 tackles, two sacks, and four interceptions.\n\nAs a junior, Chung was named Second Team All-American and first-team All-Pac-10 Conference. He received the Gordon E. Wilson Award, given to the team's top special teams player. He averaged 22.3 yards on nine kickoff returns while leading the Ducks with a career-high 117 tackles (71 solos), adding 7.5 stops for loss. He broke up nine passes and was credited with a pair of interceptions.\n\nChung garnered Third Team All-American accolades in addition to making the All-Pac 10 first-team for the second consecutive year in 2008. Along with offensive lineman Max Unger, the pair set the school record with 51 consecutive starting assignments. He had 92 tackles (58 solos) in 13 games, coming up with two sacks among his 6.5 stops for loss. He caused and recovered a fumble, batted down seven passes and returned his only interception 31 yards for a touchdown.\n\nChung holds the distinction of starting more games than any other defensive player in Oregon history, having started 51 straight games during his collegiate career.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, it was announced that Chung had decided to forgo his last year of eligibility and enter the 2008 NFL Draft. Three days later, Chung announced that he decided to instead return to Oregon for his senior year. On January 24, 2009, Chung participated in the 2009 Senior Bowl as part of Cincinnati Bengals' head coach Marvin Lewis' North team that lost 18–35 to the South. He went on to attend the NFL Scouting Combine and completed the majority of drills before sustaining a knee injury. He was unable to perform the short shuttle and three-cone drill due to the injury. On March 12, 2009, he attended Oregon's pro day and ran the short shuttle, three-cone drill, and positional drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, he was projected to be a second round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. Chung was ranked as the top strong safety prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com and was ranked the second best safety by NFL analyst Mike Mayock.\nThe New England Patriots selected Chung in the second round (34th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. Chung was the second safety drafted in 2009, one pick behind Western Michigan safety Louis Delmas.\n\nOn July 27, 2009, the New England Patriots signed Chung to a four-year, $5 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $2 million.\n\nDefensive coordinator Dean Pees held a competition to name to new starting safeties between Chung, Brandon Meriweather, James Sanders, and Brandon McGowan. Head coach Bill Belichick named Chung the backup strong safety to begin the regular season, behind Brandon Meriweather.\n\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the New England Patriots' season-opener against the Buffalo Bills and recorded one tackle in their 25–24 victory. Chung made his first career tackle with teammate Darius Butler on cornerback Leodis McKelvin during a 21-yard kick return in the fourth quarter. On October 16, 2009, Chung collected a season-high eight combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made his first career interception off a pass by quarterback Vince Young as the Patriots routed the Tennessee Titans 59–0 in Week 6. The following week, he collected four solo tackles and made his first career sack on quarterback Josh Johnson in the Patriots' 35–7 in over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Wembley Stadium in Week 7. In Week 10, Chung earned his first career start and recorded five combined tackles during a 35–34 loss at the Indianapolis Colts. He finished his rookie season with 37 combined tackles (25 solo), two sacks, a pass deflection, and an interception in 16 games and one start.\n\nThe New England Patriots finished first in the AFC East with a 10–6 record. On January 10, 2010, Chung appeared in his first career playoff game as the Patriots were defeated 33–14 by the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Wildcard Game.\n\nOn January 15, 2010, it was reported that defensive coordinator Dean Pees would not be renewing his contract or returning to the Patriots. Head coach Bill Belichick took over defensive coordinator duties for the season. Chung competed for the job as the starting strong safety against Brandon McGowan and James Sanders. He was officially named the starting strong safety to start the regular season, along with free safety Brandon Meriweather.\n\nHe started in the New England Patriots' season-opener against the Cincinnati Bengals and collected a career-high 16 combined tackles (12 solo) in their 38–24 victory. On October 4, 2010, Chung made five combined tackles and returned an interception by Chad Henne for a 51-yard touchdown to mark the first score of his career. He also blocked a punt and a field goal as the Patriots routed the Miami Dolphins 41–14 on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 4. In Week 6, he collected 13 combined tackles (five solo) in a 23–20 win against the Baltimore Ravens. The following week, Chung made a tackle before exiting a 23–20 win against the San Diego Chargers after injuring his knee. He was sidelined for the next two games (Weeks 8–9) due to the knee injury. He finished the season with 96 combined tackles (72 solo), nine pass deflections, three interceptions, and a touchdown in 14 games and 13 starts.\n\nThe New England Patriots finished atop their division with a 14–2 record, clinching a first round bye and home-field advantage. On January 16, 2011, Chung made his first career start in a playoff game and recorded four solo tackles during a 28–21 loss to the New York Jets in the AFC Divisional round. With 1:14 left in the second quarter, Chung made the decision to call an audible on a punt and opted to receive a direct snap from the longsnapper on a trick play instead and attempt to gain four-yards for the first down. He botched the direct snap and recovered the fumble for no gain at New England's 37-yard line. The mistake proved costly as the New York Jets capitalized on their field position and scored a touchdown in four plays and 41 seconds to enter half time leading the Patriots 14–3. Chung accepted responsibility for the mistake and stated it was his decision to call for the direct snap. He explained that he called the audible after discovering the Patriots had an eight on six advantage with their blocking scheme.\n\nChung entered training camp slated as the starting strong safety and was officially named the starter to begin the regular season, opposite free safety Brandon Meriweather. On September 18, 2011, Chung made five combined tackles during a 35–21 win against the San Diego Chargers in Week 2. He exited the game in the third quarter and returned with a hard cast around his thumb in the fourth quarter. Chung was inactive for the Patriots' Week 3 loss at the Buffalo Bills after he underwent surgery to repair his fractured thumb. On October 30, 2011, he collected a season-high 13 combined tackles (ten solo) and broke up a pass in the Patriots' 25–17 loss at the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 8. Chung was sidelined for seven consecutive games (Weeks 10–16) after suffering an injury to his foot. He finished the 2011 season with 62 combined tackles (37 solo), four pass deflections, an interception, and a sack in eight games and eight starts.\n\nThe New England Patriots finished atop of the AFC East with a record of 13–3, clinching a first round bye and home-field advantage. They went on to defeat the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game. On February 5, 2012, Chung started in Super Bowl XLVI and recorded six combined tackles and a pass deflection in the Patriots' 21–17 loss to the New York Giants.\n\nDefensive coordinator Matt Patricia retained Chung as the starting strong safety, alongside free safety Steve Gregory. Chung started the first six games of the season before sustaining a shoulder injury and missing four games (Weeks 7–11). During his absence, he was replaced by Devin McCourty, who was moved from cornerback to safety. Upon his return in Week 11, Chung was named the backup strong safety behind McCourty and was limited to 65 defensive snaps in the next four games (Weeks 11–14). On December 23, 2012, Chung made four combined tackles, two pass deflections, and intercepted two passes by Chad Henne during a 23–16 win at the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 16. The following week, Chung collected a season-high six combined tackles and deflected a pass in the Patriots' 28–0 victory against the Miami Dolphins in Week 17. Chung finished the season with 44 combined tackles (29 solo), five pass deflections, and two interceptions in 12 games and eight starts.\n\nOn March 12, 2013, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Chung to a three-year, $10 million contract with $4 million guaranteed. He was reunited with Eagles' head coach Chip Kelly, who served as Oregon's offensive coordinator during Chung's last two years.\n\nDefensive coordinator Billy Davis held an open competition to name two new starting safeties. The competition included Chung, Kenny Phillips, Colt Anderson, Nate Allen, Kurt Coleman, and David Sims. Head coach Chip Kelly named him the starting free safety to begin the season, along with strong safety Nate Allen.\n\nHe started in the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opener at the Washington Redskins and recorded seven combined tackles in their 33–27 victory. He was sidelined for two games (Weeks 4–5) due to a shoulder injury. In Week 6, Chung made two combined tackles before exiting the Eagles' 31–20 win at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the third quarter after aggravating his shoulder injury. He missed another two games due to the injury (Weeks 7–8) and lost his starting role to rookie Earl Wolff.

He is believed to be the only professional painter of Chechen origin in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1819, during the Caucasian War Russian troops found a dead woman and a dying wounded three-year-old baby in the Chechen aul Dady-Yurt. The commander-in-chief of the Russian army Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov ordered military medics to do everything possible to save this baby despite all medical advice saying that it was impossible. Against all the odds, the baby survived. The baby was given for nursing to Cossack Zakhar Nedonosov. From the name of this Cossack, the baby got his surname and patronymic. Later Pyotr appended the word Chechenets to his surname in order to show his ethnic identity.\n\nAt the age of seven, Pyotr was adopted by Major-General Pyotr Yermolov, Commanger of a Georgian Grenadier regiment and a cousin of Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov. Pyotr Yermolov liked Zakharov very much and, despite having seven children of his own, treated him as his own son.\n\nThe boy showed talent in painting and Pyotr Yermolov tried to send him to the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg but the president of the Academy, Aleksey Olenin, claimed that the 10-year-old boy was too young to study at the Academy and recommended hiring a private teacher. So, the boy got lessons from the portraitist Lev Volkov.\n\nEventually, at the age of 17, Zakharov entered the Academy. He graduated in 1835 with a diploma of \"Free Artist\" and was recommended for a scholarship to study art in Italy. The trip might have been helpful for both his artistic growth and for his health, which had begun to show signs of tuberculosis. However, his name was withdrawn from the list for the scholarship by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia who insisted that national minorities (\"inorodtsy\") should not benefit from the Academy's scholarships. Another misfortune followed as Zakarov's first teacher, Lev Volkov, refused to allow his daughter to marry Zakharov despite the young people being in love. Instead Volkov had her sent to relatives in the Caucasus with an order to marry her off to any first-comer just to stop the affair.\n\nZakharov soon became a fashionable portraitist. His clients included the favorite daughter of Nicholas I, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna and her future husband Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg. In 1837, he was admitted to the state service as an Artist in the Military Department. In 1842, his qualified him to become a member of the Academy of Arts.\n\nOn 14 January 1846, Zakharov married, but their happiness was short. On 13 June 1846, his wife died from tuberculosis.Zakharov died from the same disease a few months later.\n\nMany works of Zakharov-Chechenets are kept in the Tretyakov Gallery and in the Russian Museum. The Art Museum in the capital of Chechnya, Grozny also used to have many of his works including his \"Selfportrait, and \"Portrait of I.F. Ladygensky\". In 1995 during the First Chechen War the Grozny Museum was heavily damaged and the paintings were all but destroyed. Since 1995, they are being restored at the \"Grabar Restoration Center\" in Moscow.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28330", "title": "Saul", "text": "Saul\n\nSaul (; , meaning \"asked for, prayed for\"; ; , \"Ṭālūt\" or , \"Ša'ūl\"), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the first king of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah. His reign, traditionally placed in the late 11th century BCE, marked a transition from a tribal society to statehood.\n\nSaul's life and reign are described in the Hebrew Bible. He was anointed by the prophet Samuel and reigned from Gibeah. He fell on his sword (committing suicide) to avoid capture in the battle against the Philistines at Mount Gilboa, during which three of his sons were also killed. The succession to his throne was contested by Ish-bosheth, his only surviving son, and his son-in-law David, who eventually prevailed. A similar yet different account of Saul's life may be given in the Quran. Neither the length of Saul's reign, nor the extent of his territory are given in the Hebrew Bible; the former is traditionally fixed at twenty or twenty-two years, but there is no reliable evidence for these numbers.\n\nThe biblical accounts of Saul's life are found in the Books of Samuel:\n\nAccording to the Tanakh, Saul was the son of Kish, of the family of the Matrites, and a member of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve Tribes of Israel. It appears that he came from Gibeah.\nSaul married Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz, with whom he sired four sons (Jonathan, Abinadab, Malchishua and Ish-bosheth) and two daughters (Merab and Michal). \n\nSaul also had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, who bore him two sons, Armoni and Mephibosheth. ().\n\nSaul died at the Battle of Mount Gilboa (; ), and was buried in Zelah, in the region of Benjamin (). Three of Saul's sons – Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua – died with him at Mount Gilboa (; ). Ish-bosheth became king of Israel, at the age of forty. At David's request Abner had Michal returned to David. Ish-bosheth reigned for two years, but after the death of Abner, was killed by two of his own captains ().\n\nArmoni and Mephibosheth (Saul's sons with his concubine, Rizpah) were given by David along with the five sons of Merab (Saul's daughter) to the Gibeonites, who killed them. () Michal was childless ().\n\nThe only male descendant of Saul to survive was Mephibosheth, Jonathan's lame son (), who was five years old at the time of his father's and grandfather's deaths. In time, he came under the protection of David (). Mephibosheth had a young son, Micah (), who had four sons and descendants named until the ninth generation ().\n\nThe First Book of Samuel gives three accounts of Saul's rise to the throne in three successive chapters:\n\n\nAndré Lemaire finds the third account probably the most reliable tradition. The Pulpit Commentary distinguishes between a private and a public selection process.\n\nHaving been anointed by Samuel, Saul is told of signs indicating that he has been divinely appointed. The last of these is that Saul will be met by an ecstatic group of prophets leaving a \"high place\" and playing the lyre, tambourine, and flutes. Saul encounters the ecstatic prophets and joins them. Later, Saul sends men to pursue David, but when they meet a group of ecstatic prophets playing music, they become possessed by a \"prophetic state\" and join in. Saul sends more men, but they too join the prophets. Eventually Saul himself goes, and also joins the prophets. ().\n\nAfter relieving the siege of Jabesh-Gilead, Saul conducts military campaigns against the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Aram Rehob and the kings of Zobah, the Philistines, and the Amalekites (). A biblical summary states that \"wherever he turned, he was victorious\".\n\nIn his continuing battles with Philistines, Saul instructs his armies, by a rash oath, to fast. Methodist commentator Joseph Benson suggests that \"Saul’s intention in putting this oath was undoubtedly to save time, lest the Philistines should gain ground of them in their flight. But the event showed it was a false policy; for the people were so faint and weak for want of food, that they were less able to follow and slay the Philistines than if they had stopped to take a moderate refreshment\". Jonathan's party were not aware of the oath and ate honey, resulting in Jonathan realising that he had broken an oath of which he was not aware, but was nevertheless liable for its breach, until popular intervention allowed Jonathan to be saved from death on account of his victory over the Philistines.\n\nSaul planned a military action against the Philistines. Samuel said that he would arrive in seven days to perform the requisite rites. When a week passed with no word of Samuel, and with the Israelites growing restless, Saul prepares for battle by offering sacrifices. Samuel arrives just as Saul is finishing sacrificing and reprimands Saul for not obeying his instructions.\n\nLater Samuel instructs Saul to make war on the Amalekites and to \"utterly destroy\" them, in fulfilment of a mandate set out :\nHaving forewarned the Kenites who were living among the Amalekites to leave, Saul goes to war and defeats the Amalekites. Saul kills all the men, women, children and poor quality livestock, but leaves alive the king and best livestock. When Samuel learns that Saul has not obeyed his instructions in full, he informs Saul that God has rejected him as king due to his disobedience. As Samuel turns to go, Saul seizes hold of his garments and tears off a piece; Samuel prophecies that the kingdom will likewise be torn from Saul. Samuel then kills the Amalekite king himself. Samuel and Saul each return home and never meet again after these events ().\n\nAfter Samuel tells Saul that God has rejected him as king, David, a son of Jesse, from the tribe of Judah, enters the story: from this point on Saul's story is largely the account of his increasingly troubled relationship with David.\n\n\nSaul offered his elder daughter Merab as a wife to the now popular David, after his victory over Goliath, but David demurred. David distinguishes himself in the Philistine wars. Upon David's return from battle, the women praise him in song:\nimplying that David is the greater warrior. Saul fears David's growing popularity and henceforth views him as a rival to the throne.\n\nSaul's son Jonathan and David become close friends. Jonathan recognizes David as the rightful king, and \"made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.\" Jonathan even gives David his military clothes, symbolizing David's position as successor to Saul.\nOn two occasions, Saul threw a spear at David as he played the harp for Saul. David becomes increasingly successful and Saul becomes increasingly resentful. Now Saul actively plots against David. Saul offered his other daughter, Michal in marriage to David. David initially rejects this offer also, claiming he is too poor. Saul offers to accept a bride price of 100 Philistine foreskins, intending that David die in the attempt. Instead, David obtains 200 foreskins and is consequently married to Michal. Jonathan arranges a short-lived reconciliation between Saul and David and for a while David served Saul \"as in times past\" () until \"the distressing spirit from the Lord\" re-appeared. Saul sends assassins in the night, but Michal helps him escape, tricking them by placing a household idol in his bed. David flees to Jonathan, who arranges a meeting with his father. While dining with Saul, Jonathan explains David's absence, saying he has been called away to his brothers. But Saul sees through the ruse and reprimands Jonathan for protecting David, warning him that his love of David will cost him the kingdom, furiously throwing a spear at him. The next day, Jonathan meets with David and tells him Saul's intent. The two friends say their goodbyes, and David flees into the countryside. Saul later marries Michal to another man.\n\nSaul is later informed by his head shepherd, Doeg the Edomite, that high priest Ahimelech assisted David, giving him the sword of Goliath, which had been kept at the temple at Nob. Doeg kills Ahimelech and eighty-five other priests and Saul orders the death of the entire population of Nob.\n\nDavid had left Nob by this point and had amassed some 300 disaffected men including some outlaws. With these men David rescues the town of Keilah from a Philistine attack. Saul realises he could trap David and his men by laying the city to siege. David realizes that the citizens of Keilah will betray him to Saul. He flees to Ziph pursued by Saul. Saul hunts David in the vicinity of Ziph on two occasions:\n\n\nThe Philistines make war again, assembling at Shunem, and Saul leads his army to face them at Mount Gilboa. Before the battle he goes to consult a medium or witch at Endor. The medium, unaware of his identity, reminds him that the king has made witchcraft a capital offence, but he assures her that Saul will not harm her. She conjures the spirit of the prophet Samuel, who before his death had prophesied that he would lose the kingdom. Samuel tells him that God has fully rejected him, will no longer hear his prayers, has given the kingdom to David and that the next day he will lose both the battle and his life. Saul collapses in fear, and the medium restores him with food in anticipation of the next day's battle.\n\n1 Samuel and 2 Samuel give conflicting accounts of Saul's death. In 1 Samuel, and in a parallel account in 1 Chronicles 10, as the defeated Israelites flee, Saul asks his armour bearer to kill him, but he refuses, and so Saul falls upon his own sword. In 2 Samuel, an Amalekite tells David he found Saul leaning on his spear after the battle and delivered the \"coup de grâce\". David has the Amalekite put to death for accusing himself of killing the anointed king.\n\nThe victorious Philistines recover Saul's body as well as those of his three sons who also died in the battle, decapitated them and displayed them on the wall of Beth-shan. They display Saul's armour in the temple of Ashtaroth (an Ascalonian temple of the Canaanites). But at night the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead retrieve the bodies for cremation and burial (). Later on, David takes the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan and buries them in Zela, in the tomb of his father (). The account in 1 Chronicles summarises by stating that:\n\nThere are several textual or narrative issues in the text, including the aforementioned conflicting accounts of Saul's rise to kingship and his death, as well as plays on words, that biblical scholars have discussed.\n\nThe birth-narrative of the prophet Samuel is found at 1 Samuel 1–28. It describes how Samuel's mother Hannah requests a son from Yahweh, and dedicates the child to God at the shrine of Shiloh. The passage makes extensive play with the root-elements of Saul's name, and ends with the phrase \"hu sa'ul le-Yahweh\", \"he is dedicated to Yahweh.\" Hannah names the resulting son Samuel, giving as her explanation, \"because from God I requested him.\" Samuel's name, however, can mean \"name of God,\" (or \"Heard of God\" or \"Told of God\") and the etymology and multiple references to the root of the name seems to fit Saul instead. The majority explanation for the discrepancy is that the narrative originally described the birth of Saul, and was given to Samuel in order to enhance the position of David and Samuel at the former king's expense.\n\nThe Bible's tone with regard to Saul changes over the course of the narrative, especially around the passage where David appears, midway through 1 Samuel. Before, Saul is presented in positive terms, but afterward his mode of ecstatic prophecy is suddenly described as fits of madness, his errors and disobedience to Samuel's instructions are stressed and he becomes a paranoiac. This may indicate that the David story is inserted from a source loyal to the House of David; David's lament over Saul in 2 Samuel 1 then serves an apologetic purpose, clearing David of the blame for Saul's death.\n\nGod's apparent change of mind in rejecting Saul as king has raised questions about God's \"repentance\", which could be considered as inconsistent with God's immutability. In the King James Version, God's word to Samuel states \"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king\". Samuel's words later clarify that God's repentance is not like human regret or reconsideration:\nMethodist biblical commentator Joseph Benson writes that \"Repentance, properly speaking, implies grief of heart, and a change of counsels. Understood in which sense, it can have no place in God. But it is often ascribed to him in the Scriptures when he alters his method of dealing with persons, and treats them as if he did indeed repent of the kindness he had shown them.\"\n\nIn the Books of Samuel, Saul is not referred to as a king (\"melech\"), but rather as a \"leader\" or \"commander\" (\"nagid\") (; ). However, Saul is also said to be made a \"king\" (\"melech\") at Gilgal ().\n\nVarious authors have attempted to harmonize the two narratives regarding Saul's death. Josephus writes that Saul's attempted suicide was stalled because he was not able to run the sword through himself, and that he therefore asked the Amalekite to finish it. Later biblical criticism has posited that the story of Saul's death was redacted from various sources, although this view in turn has been criticized because it does not explain why the contradiction was left in by the redactors. But since 2 Samuel records only the Amalekite's report, and not the report of any other eye-witness, some scholars theorize that the Amalekite may have been lying to try to gain favor with David. On this view, 1 Samuel records what actually happened, while 2 Samuel records what the Amalekite \"claims\" happened.\n\nTwo opposing views of Saul are found in classical rabbinical literature. One is based on the reverse logic that punishment is a proof of guilt, and therefore seeks to rob Saul of any halo which might surround him; typically this view is similar to the \"republican source\". The passage referring to Saul as \"a choice young man, and goodly\" (1 Samuel 9:2) is in this view interpreted as meaning that Saul was not good in every respect, but \"goodly\" only with respect to his personal appearance (Num. Rashi 9:28). According to this view, Saul is only a \"weak branch\" (Gen. Rashi 25:3), owing his kingship not to his own merits, but rather to his grandfather, who had been accustomed to light the streets for those who went to the \"bet ha-midrash\", and had received as his reward the promise that one of his grandsons should sit upon the throne (Lev. Rashi 9:2).\n\nThe second view of Saul makes him appear in the most favourable light as man, as hero, and as king. This view is similar to that of the \"monarchical source\". In this view it was on account of his modesty that he did not reveal the fact that he had been anointed king (1 Samuel 10:16; Meg. 13b); and he was extraordinarily upright as well as perfectly just. Nor was there any one more pious than he (M. Q. 16b; Ex. Rashi 30:12); for when he ascended the throne he was as pure as a child, and had never committed sin (Yoma 22b). He was marvelously handsome; and the maidens who told him concerning Samuel (cf 1 Samuel 9:11–13) talked so long with him that they might observe his beauty the more (Ber. 48b). In war he was able to march 120 miles without rest. When he received the command to smite Amalek (1 Samuel 15:3), Saul said: \"For one found slain the Torah requires a sin offering [Deuteronomy 21:1–9]; and here so many shall be slain. If the old have sinned, why should the young suffer; and if men have been guilty, why should the cattle be destroyed?\" It was this mildness that cost him his crown. And while Saul was merciful to his enemies, he was strict with his own people; when he found out that Ahimelech, a kohen, had assisted David with finding food, Saul, in retaliation, killed the rest of the 85 kohanim of the family of Ahimelech and the rest of his hometown, Nov. (Yoma 22b; Num. Rashi 1:10) The fact that he was merciful even to his enemies, being indulgent to rebels themselves, and frequently waiving the homage due to him, was incredible as well as deceiving. But if his mercy toward a foe was a sin, it was his only one; and it was his misfortune that it was reckoned against him, while David, although he had committed much iniquity, was so favored that it was not remembered to his injury (Yoma 22b; M. Q. 16b, and Rashi ad loc.). In some respects Saul was superior to David, e.g., in having only one concubine {Rizpah}, while David had many. Saul expended his own substance for the war, and although he knew that he and his sons would fall in battle, he nevertheless went forward, while David heeded the wish of his soldiers not to go to war in person (2 Samuel 21:17; Lev. Rashi 26:7; Yalq., Sam. 138).\n\nAccording to the Rabbis, Saul ate his food with due regard for the rules of ceremonial purity prescribed for the sacrifice (Yalq., l.c.), and taught the people how they should slay cattle (cf 1 Samuel 14:34). As a reward for this, God himself gave Saul a sword on the day of battle, since no other sword suitable for him was found (ibid 13:22). Saul's attitude toward David finds its excuse in the fact that his courtiers were all tale-bearers, and slandered David to him (Deut. Rashi 5:10); and in like manner he was incited by Doeg against the priests of Nob (1 Samuel 22:16–19; Yalq., Sam. 131)—this act was forgiven him, however, and a heavenly voice (\"bat qol\") was heard, proclaiming: \"Saul is the chosen one of God\" (Ber. 12b). His anger at the Gibeonites (2 Samuel 21:2) was not personal hatred, but was induced by zeal for the welfare of Israel (Num. Rashi 8:4). The fact that he made his daughter remarry (1 Samuel 25:44), finds its explanation in his (Saul's) view that her betrothal to David had been gained by false pretenses, and was therefore invalid (Sanhedrin 19b). During the lifetime of Saul there was no idolatry in Israel. The famine in the reign of David (cf 2 Samuel 21:1) was to punish the people, because they had not accorded Saul the proper honours at his burial (Num. Rashi 8:4). In Sheol, Samuel reveals to Saul that in the next world, Saul would dwell with Samuel, which is a proof that all has been forgiven him by God ('Er. 53ba).\n\nSome Muslims refer to Saul as Tālūt (), and believe that (as in the Bible) he was the commander of Israel. Other scholars, however, have identified Talut as Gideon with the reasoning that the Qur'an references the same incident of the drinking from the river as that found in Judges 7:5–7 and other factors associated with Gideon. According to the Qur'an, Talut was chosen by the Prophet Samuel (not mentioned by name explicitly, but rather as \"a Prophet\" of the Israelites) after being asked by the people of Israel for a King) to lead them into war. The Israelites criticized Samuel for appointing Talut, lacking respect for Talut because he was not wealthy. Samuel rebuked the people for this and told them that Talut was more favored than they were. Talut led the Israelites to victory over the army of Goliath, who was killed by Dawud (David). Talut is not considered a \"Nabi\" (, Prophet), but a Divinely appointed King.\n\nThe name 'Tālūt' has uncertain etymology. Unlike some other Qur'anic figures, the Arabic name is not similar to the Hebrew name (\"Sha'ul\"). According to Muslim exegetes, the name 'Tālūt' means 'Tall' (from the Arabic \"tūl\") and refers to the extraordinary stature of Saul, which would be consistent with the Biblical account. In explanation of the name, exegetes such as Tha'labi hold that at this time, the future King of Israel was to be recognised by his height; Samuel set up a measure, but no one in Israel reached its height except Tālūt (Saul).\n\nIn the Qur'an, Israelites demanded a King after the time of Musa (Moses). God appointed Talut as their King. Saul was distinguished by the greatness of his knowledge and of his physique; it was a sign of his role as King that God brought back the Ark of the Covenant for Israel. Talut tested his people at a river; whoever drank from it would not follow him in battle excepting one who takes [from it] in the hollow of his hand. Many drank but only the faithful ventured on. In the battle, however, David slew Goliath and was made the subsequent King of Israel.\n\nThe Qur'anic account differs from the Biblical account (if Saul is assumed to be Talut) in that in the Bible the sacred Ark was returned to Israel before Saul's accession, and the test by drinking water is made in the Hebrew Bible not by Saul but by Gideon.. However, the story of Saul in 1 Samuel 14 has parallels to Qur'an 2:246-251, faithfully accounting for the sacred Ark and the fasting test (; ; ).\n\nThe historicity of Saul's kingdom is not universally accepted and there is insufficient extrabiblical evidence to verify if the biblical account reflects historical reality. The notion of a United Monarchy of Israel and Judah is believed by some scholars to be a later ideological construct; statehood in Judah is thought, on the basis of archaeological evidence, to have emerged no earlier than the 8th century BCE.\n\nSaul’s kingdom was not very large. It probably included Mt. Ephraim, Benjamin and Gilead. He also exerted some influence in the northern mountains in Judah and beyond the Jezreel Valley. His capital appears to have been basically a military camp near Gibeah. Archeology seems to confirm that until about 1000 BCE, the end of Iron Age I, Israelite society was essentially a society of farmers and stockbreeders without any truly centralized organization and administration.\n\nAccounts of Saul's behavior have made him a popular subject for speculation among modern psychiatrists. George Stein views the passages depicting Saul's ecstatic episodes as suggesting that he may have suffered from mania. Martin Huisman sees the story of Saul as illustrative of the role of stress as a factor in depression. Liubov Ben-Noun of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, believes that passages referring to King Saul's disturbed behavior indicate he was afflicted by a mental disorder, and lists a number of possible conditions. However, Christopher C. H. Cook of the Department of Theology and Religion, Durham University, UK recommends caution in offering any diagnoses in relation to people who lived millennia ago.\n\n\n"}

He faced competition from three of his brothers, primarily from Rabbi Yehuda Leib Schneersohn who established a dynasty in Kapust upon their father's death. Other brothers also established dynasties in Lyady, Nizhyn, and Ovruch.\n\nIn 1848 Rabbi Schneersohn was married to the daughter of his brother, Rabbi Chaim Shneur Zalman Schneersohn. After several months, she died, and he then married the Rebbetzin Rivkah, a granddaughter of Rabbi Dovber Schneuri, the Mitteler Rebbe. He had three sons, Rabbi Zalman Aharon, Rabbi Shalom Dovber and Rabbi Menachem Mendel as well as one daughter, Rebbetzin Devorah Leah.\n\nRabbi Schneersohn was said to have had chariots on call for the evacuation of books in time of fire.\n\nBesides his communal activism, he had wide intellectual interests. He spoke several languages, including Latin. He wrote widely on a range of religious and secular topics, and much of his writing has never been published and remains in manuscript form alone. His discourses began to be published for the first time under the title \"Likkutei Torat Shmuel\" in 1945 by Kehot, and 12 volumes have so far been printed.\n\nHe died in Lyubavichi, on 13 Tishrei 1882, leaving three sons and two daughters, and was succeeded by his son Sholom Dovber.\n\nRabbi Schneersohn urged the study of Kabbalah as a prerequisite for one's humanity:\nA person who is capable of comprehending the \"seder hishtalshelus\" (kabbalistic secrets concerning the coming-into-being of all existence every moment) - and fails to do so - cannot be considered a human being. At every moment and time one must know where his soul stands. It is a mitzvah (commandment) and an obligation to know the \"seder hishtalshelus\".\n\n\"The world says, 'If you can't crawl under, climb over.' But I say, \"Lechatchilah Ariber\"--'At the outset, one should climb over.'\"\n\"You cannot fool God; ultimately, you cannot fool others either. The only one you can fool is yourself.

She was briefly interim regent of Bohemia after the death of Wenceslaus in 1419.\n\nSophia was a member of the House of Wittelsbach and was the youngest child and only daughter of John II, Duke of Bavaria, and his spouse Catherine of Gorizia. Sophia's two brothers were Ernest, Duke of Bavaria, and William III, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Stephen II, Duke of Bavaria and his first wife Elisabetta of Sicily, daughter of Frederick III of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou. Sophia was a cousin of Isabeau of Bavaria, Queen of France. Sophia's maternal grandparents were Count Meinhard VI of Gorizia and Catharina of Pfannberg.\n\nSophia grew up in the care of her uncle, Frederick, Duke of Bavaria, in Landshut. Sophia liked hunting, which was one thing she had in common with her future husband. In 1388 uncle took her to Prague, where he worked through political negotiations to have his niece married off. He said that the twelve-year-old princess was impressed with Wenceslaus, moreover, the marriage was for political reasons. Sophia's father was represented in the negotiation of the marriage by her uncle Duke Frederick.\n\nOn 2 May 1389 in Prague, Sophia married Wenceslaus, King of the Romans. Wenceslas and Sophie were probably married by the king's chancellor, Bishop Jan. Wenceslaus was in a dispute with the Archbishop of Prague, which threatened Sophia's coronation. She could have only been crowned queen by an archbishop.\n\nWenceslaus celebrated the marriage by making a number of excellent manuscripts such as the Wenceslas Bible. There was also a manuscript on marital fidelity. The relationship was described as happy. Sophia had no children.\n\nSophia's husband was certainly not an incompetent ruler, in chronicles he was described in a biased manner. Sophia is described as economically talented. In March 1393, her confessor John of Nepomuk died under torture. It was said that he died refusing to reveal her confession, but he was also at that time involved in a conflict with Jan of Jenštejn. During the rebellion and the imprisonment of her spouse in 1402–1403, she lived in Hradec Králové. Queen Sophia was initially a follower of Jan Hus and listened to his sermons, and like Wenceslas, she gave him her protection. After Hus was banned by the Pope in 1410, however, she withdraw her support. She was convinced that the death of Hus, in 1415, would lead to a riot.\n\nWenceslaus died in 1419. As a queen dowager, Sophia sought refuge with her brother-in-law, Sigismund of Hungary, whose claims on the throne of Bohemia she supported. For a period of time, Sophia was the official regent of Bohemia. In October 1419, the leading Bohemians signed a treaty with queen dowager Sophia with a promise to protect law and order. She soon lost authority, however. Sophia and Sigismund were involved in managing a property in Prešpurk together. There were rumours that Sophia and Sigismund had an affair. Sigismund remarked that the Queen dowager of Bohemia would surely marry again – possibly to Wladyslaw II of Poland.\n\nSophia died on 4 November 1428.\n\n"}

{"id": "1974223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974223", "title": "Syndic", "text": "Syndic\n\nSyndic (Late Latin: '; Greek: ' – one who helps in a court of justice, an advocate, representative) is a term applied in certain countries to an officer of government with varying powers, and secondly to a representative or delegate of a university, institution or other corporation, entrusted with special functions or powers.\n\nThe meaning which underlies both applications is that of representative or delegate. Du Cange (\"Gloss, s.v. Syndicus\"), after defining the word as defensor, patronus, advocatus, proceeds \"Syndici maxime appellantur Actores universitatum, collegiorum, societatum et aliorum corporum, per quos, tanquam in republica quod communiter agi fierive oportet, agitur et fit,\" and gives several examples from the 13th century of the use of the term. The most familiar use of \"syndic\" in the first sense is that of the Italian \"sindaco\" (or , who is the head of the administration of a \"comune\", comparable to a mayor, and a government official, elected by the residents of commune.\n\nAs indicated above, in Italy and parts of Switzerland, the term \"sindaco\" or \"sindaca\" is equivalent to the English term mayor, in this case, the head of the administration of a \"comune\".\n\nIn areas where Catalan or Occitan are spoken, the term has been used since Medieval times. At present it is used in a variety of cases. The president of Andorra's parliament is known as the \"\"Síndic General\"\" or General Councillor. Until the 1993 Constitution, the Síndic was the effective head of government of Andorra. Similarly, the Sindic d'Aran / Síndic d'Aran (in Occitan and Catalan, respectively) is the head of the administration of this small region (Vall d'Aran) in Catalonia. In Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, the \"Síndic de Greuges\" or \"Síndica de Greuges\" (\"advocate of grievances\") is the ombudsman or ombudswoman, while the \"Síndic de Comptes\" or \"Síndica de Comptes\" is a board member of the Public Audit Office in each of the three regions. In the Valencian Parliament, the spokesperson or speaker of a parliamentary group is called a \"síndic\" or \"síndica\", and together they form the \"Junta de Síndics\" (Board of Spokespersons), while in the Horta de València region (the area around the city of Valencia), a \"síndic\" is also a member of the Water Tribunal (\"Tribunal de les Aigües\"), the body in charge of regulating irrigation matters. In Alguer, Sardinia, the \"síndic\" is the equivalent of mayor.\n\nIn Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, nearly all companies, guilds, and the University of Paris had representative bodies the members of which were termed \"syndici\". Similarly in England, the Regent House of the University of Cambridge, which is the legislative body, delegates certain functions to special committees of its members, appointed from time to time by Grace (a proposal offered to the Regent House and confirmed by it); these committees are termed \"syndicates\" and are permanent or occasional, and the members are styled \"the syndics\" of the particular committee or of the institution which they administer; thus there are the syndics of the Fitzwilliam Museum, of the Cambridge University Press, of local examinations, etc.\n\nThe term \"sindicat\" in Catalan is used in a broad sense to mean an association for the defence of the economic or social interests of its members, and therefore is often used generically to refer to labour organizations, as well as in the titles of certain labour organizations or federations (for instance, the Confederació Sindical de Treballadors de Catalunya, the Unió Sindical Obrera de Catalunya, the Coordinadora Obrera Sindical, etc.), student organizations (Sindicat d'Estudiants dels Països Catalans, Sindicat d'Estudiants del País Valencià, Sindicat Democràtic d'Estudiants de la Universitat de Barcelona, etc.) and journalist organizations (Sindicat de Periodistes de Catalunya / Sindicat de Professionals de la Comunicació, etc.), among others. The members or leaders of these organisations, however, are not called \"síndics\".\n\nIn France, a \"syndic de copropriété\" is an important figure in millions of lives, elected by owners of condominiums to represent property owners in the management of the co-owned building or property. While the profession is regulated, fees are not, and complaints of overcharging are frequent. The \"Association des responsables de copropriété\" (ARC) reported that fees rose by 4% in 2016, though the rate of inflation was only 0.2%, and since 2014 three of the largest \"syndics\" in Paris have raised their fees by amounts ranging from 26% to 37%.\n\nOne special use of the term applies to the Franciscan order of priests and brothers. The Order of Friars Minor (OFM), as opposed to the Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.) is forbidden by its constitutions from owning property, as part of its commitment to communal poverty. Various arrangements therefore exist whereby churches and houses of the order are owned by the Holy See itself, or the local diocese or, sometimes, by a \"syndic,\" an independent layman who is the actual owner of the land but who loans it to the friars.\n\nWithin Syndicalist and Anarcho-syndicalist organizations, a syndic is a member of an autonomous union, also called a Syndicate, which make up the basic organizational unit of society. As these models are organized along principles of non-hierarchy and direct democracy, the title syndic is applied to all in the syndicate and does not imply a position of power over any other member, unlike older usages of the title.\n\n"}

The report is issued annually in cooperation with Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University in the United States.\n\nThe publication highlights people who are influential as Muslims. That is people whose influence is derived from their practice of Islam or from the fact that they are Muslim. Nominations are evaluated on the basis of the influence that particular Muslims have had within the Muslim community and the manner in which their influence has benefited the Muslim community, both within the Islamic world and in terms of representing Islam to non-Muslims. \"Influential\" for the purposes of the book is defined as \"any person who has the power (be it cultural, ideological, financial, political or otherwise) to make a change that will have a significant impact on the Muslim World\".\n\nThe publication defines eligible entries with the following: \"Traditional Islam (96% of the world's Muslims): Also known as Orthodox Islam, this ideology is not politicized and largely based on consensus of correct opinion—thus including the Sunni, Shi'a, and Ibadi branches of practice (and their subgroups) within the fold of Islam, and not groups such as the Druze or the Ahmadiyya, among others.\"\n\nThe book starts with an overall top 50, ranked the most influential Muslims in the world. The remaining 450 most prominent Muslims is broken down into 15 categories without ranking, of scholarly, political, administrative, lineage, preachers and spiritual guides, women, youth, philanthropy/charity, development, science and technology, arts and culture, Qu'ran reciters, media, radicals, international Islamic networks and issues of the day. Each year the biographies are updated.\n\nThe publication also gives an insight into the different ways that Muslims impact the world and also shows the diversity of how people are living as Muslims today. The book's appendices comprehensively list populations of Muslims in nations worldwide, and its introduction gives a snapshot view of different ideological movements within the Muslim world, breaking down clearly distinctions between traditional Islam and recent radical innovations.\n\nIn 2009, the book was edited by Professors John L. Esposito and Ibrahim Kalin at Georgetown University in Washington.\n\nThe 500 most influential Muslims were chosen largely in terms of their overt influence. The top 50 is dominated by religious scholars and either heads of state, which automatically gives them an advantage when it comes to influence, or they have inherited their position. Lineage is a significant factor – it has its own category – and the predisposition to include children of important people reveals a mindset that indicates achievement is an optional extra. The top 50 fits into six broad categories as follows: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are \"preachers\", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations.\n\nThe book has given the first place to King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia. Second place went to Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader of Iran. King Mohammed VI of Morocco found third place and King Abdullah II Al-Hussain of Jordan occupied fourth place. Fifth place went to Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nThe first solely religious leader is Iraq's Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in seventh place. Fethullah Gülen came 13th. The heads of Hezbollah; Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah listed 17th and Hamas Khaled Mashaal listed 34th.\n\nThe highest-ranking American (and highest-ranking convert) at 38th place was Sheikh Hamza Yusuf Hanson, founder of the Zaytuna Institute in Berkeley, California. Right after him comes the highest-ranking European, Sheikh Mustafa Cerić, grand mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn total 72 Americans are among the 500, a disproportionately strong showing. Timothy Winter (Abdal Hakim Murad) was the highest ranked British Muslim, in an unspecified position between 51st and 60th, considerably higher than the three other British people who made the list – the Conservative Party chairman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi; the UK's first Muslim life peer, Lord Nazir Ahmed; and Dr Anas Al Shaikh Ali, director of the International Institute of Islamic Thought.\n\nThe women featured had a separate section from the men. There were only three women listed in the top 50. Sheikha Munira al-Qubaysi (number 21), an educator of girls and women; Queen Rania of Jordan (number 37), who promotes global education; and Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned of Qatar (number 38), who is chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development.\n\nThe listing also includes an extensive Arts and Culture Section. The general Arts and Culture Section included the names of singers Salif Keita, Youssou N'Dour, Raihan, Yusuf Islam and Sami Yusuf, Dawud Wharnsby; musician A. R. Rahman (India); film stars Aamir Khan and Shahrukh Khan; comedian Azhar Usman and martial artist Ma Yue. All the Qāriʾs (Quran reciters) listed in the book are from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Foreign Policy\" magazine's Marc Lynch stated, \"Esposito and Kalin's methodology seems strange. Any list in which the Sultan of Oman (Qaboos bin Said al Said, who was sixth) outranks, say, Turkish preacher Fethullah Gülen (placed 13th) or the Aga Khan (Aga Khan IV, who was placed 20th) seems odd to this observer...\"\n\nIn 2010, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list as the most influential Muslim in the world for the second consecutive year. Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei maintained second place. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan moved into third place. Jordanian King Abdullah II was placed fourth above Moroccan King Mohammed VI who moved down to fifth place.\n\nIn 2011, achievements of a lifetime were given more weight than achievements within the current year. which meant that the lists of names were going to change gradually, rather than dramatically, year-on-year. The Arab Spring had no impact on Saudi King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's influence, it had boosted King Mohammed VI of Morocco's influence, who moved up to second place, and it had no effect on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who came in third place.\n\nErdoğan was expected by many to receive the top spot in light of the Arab Spring. Erdoğan was credited with Turkey's \"Muslim democracy\", and was seen as the leader of a country that, as the Brookings Institution said, \"played the 'most constructive' role in the Arab events.\"\n\nEmir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani influence rose during the Arab Spring, moving him to sixth place. He had driven much of the Arab Spring through the coverage given by \"Al Jazeera\", given financial support to protesters and political support to Libya, making him arguably the biggest enabler of the Arab Spring.\n\nIn 2012, the edition was published by S. Abdallah Schleifer, Professor Emeritus and Senior Fellow Kamal Adham Center for Television & Digital Journalism, The American University in Cairo.\n\nThere were more Muslims from America than any other country again with 41 spots on the 500 list. Countries with the next highest number of names were Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom, with 25 Muslims each, followed by Indonesia, with 24. It lists the winners according to 13 categories, including spiritual guides, Quran reciters, scholars, politicians, celebrities, sports figures, radicals, and media leaders.\n\nFor the fourth year running, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list. He was followed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at second place. Erdoğan's advance gave him advantage over Moroccan King Mohammed VI who took the third place. Fourth place went to Dr Mohammed Badie, whose name appeared in the top 10 for the first time. He was followed by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who took the fifth place. Sheikh Al-Azhar Dr. Ahmad el-Tayeb and prominent Islamic scholar Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi who is President of Global Association of Muslim Scholars, also made it to the top 10 ranks.\n\n\"The Clarinet Projected\" reported that they considered seven of the top ten to be \"Islamists\".\n\nIn 2013, the list was edited once again by Professor Emeritus S. Abdallah Schleifer of the American University in Cairo.\n\nThe top of the list went to Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Sheikh of the Al Azhar University for the prominent role played by him in Egypt's troubled democratic transition His astute decision making over the past couple of years has preserved the traditional approach of Al-Azhar which faced threats from Islamists and Salafis in the years that have followed Mubarak's fall. His public support of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's coup also gave it a strong religious grounding that was necessary for it to achieve the legitimacy needed to prevent a civil war, effectively making him a \"king-maker\" and cementing his place at the top of the list. He was followed on the listing by Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud and Iranian Grand Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei.\n\nReflective of the wider trajectory of the Arab Spring, this year's list showed a decline in influence from Muslim Brotherhood associated figures Dr Mohammed Badie, Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. Coup kingpin General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who was previously unlisted now ranks at 29.\n\nThe US dominates the list again with 41 inclusions including Muhammad Ali, Dr Mehmet Oz, Rep. Keith Ellison, Yasiin Bey (Mos Def), and Fareed Zakaria. Representing the UK are Mo Farah, Yusuf Islam, Riz Khan, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Cambridge's Dr Timothy Winter and 18 others.\n\nIn 2014, the chief editor of the list was again Professor S Abdallah Schleifer. The top spot went back to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, due to his being the \"absolute monarch of the most powerful Arab nation.\" The list accords him the place in light of Saudi Arabia being home to Islam's two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, which millions of Muslims visit throughout the year, as well as the kingdom's oil exports. Rounding out the top three are Dr Muhammad Ahmed al-Tayeb, grand sheikh of Al-Azhar University and grand imam of Al-Azhar mosque, and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The top nine are all political leaders and royals, including Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe top 50 fit into six broad categories: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are \"preachers\", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations. In total 72 Americans are among the 500 most influential Muslims, a disproportionately strong showing, but only one among the top 50, Sheikh Hamza Yusuf Hanson of Zaytuna Institute listed at number 38.\n\nIn 2015, the top 50 was again dominated by religious scholars and heads of state. The top five, was King Abdullah of Jordan; Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheikh of Egypt's Al-Azhar University; King Salman of Saudi Arabia; Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan came in at Number eight, but surprisingly Syrian President Bashar al-Assad did not make the Top 50 this year or last, though he is still listed in the 500. The prime minister of Iraq did not make the list, but Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hussein Sistani did, coming in at number nine.\n\nThere was 32 newcomers to the 2016 list. 22 Indians featured on the list. As in past years, there continued to be more Muslims from the United States than any other country. Since at least 2012, the U.S. has outpaced nations with a far larger Muslim population, with at least 40 notable people of influence, with Pakistan (33), Saudi Arabia (32), Egypt (27) and the UK (27).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "471783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471783", "title": "The Waterboys", "text": "The Waterboys\n\nThe Waterboys are a Scottish-Irish folk rock band formed in Edinburgh in 1983 by Scottish musician Mike Scott. The band's membership, past and present, has been composed mainly of musicians from Scotland. Mike Scott has remained as the only constant member throughout the band's career. They have explored a number of different styles, but their music is mainly a mix of folk music with rock and roll. They dissolved in 1993 when Scott departed to pursue a solo career. They reformed in 2000, and continue to release albums and tour worldwide. Scott emphasises a continuity between The Waterboys and his solo work, saying that \"To me there's no difference between Mike Scott and the Waterboys; they both mean the same thing. They mean myself and whoever are my current travelling musical companions.\"\n\nThe early Waterboys sound was dubbed \"The Big Music\" after a song on their second album, \"A Pagan Place\". This style was described by Scott as \"a metaphor for seeing God's signature in the world.\" Waterboys chronicler Ian Abrahams elaborated on this by defining \"The Big Music\" as, \"...a mystical celebration of paganism. It's extolling the basic and primitive divinity that exists in everything ('the oceans and the sand'), religious and spiritual all encompassing. Here is something that can't be owned or built upon, something that has its existence in the concept of Mother Earth and has an ancestral approach to religion. And it takes in and embraces the feminine side of divinity, pluralistic in its acceptance of the wider pantheon of paganism.\"\n\n\"The Big Music\" either influenced or was used to describe a number of other bands specializing in an anthemic sound, including U2, Simple Minds, In Tua Nua, Big Country and Hothouse Flowers. \n\nIn the late 1980s, the band became significantly more folk influenced. The Waterboys eventually returned to rock and roll, and have released both rock and folk albums since reforming.\n\nThe Waterboys have gone through three distinct phases. Their early years, or \"Big Music\" period was followed by a folk music period which was characterised by an emphasis on touring over album production and by a large band membership, leading to the description of the group as a \"Raggle Taggle band\". After a brief return to the \"Big Music\" for one tour and the release of a mainstream rock and roll album with \"Dream Harder\", the band dissolved until its rebirth in 2000. In the years since, the band has revisited both rock and folk music, and continues to tour and release studio albums.\n\nScott, the founder and only permanent member of The Waterboys, made a number of solo recordings in late 1981 and early 1982 while in a band named Another Pretty Face (later called Funhouse). These sessions at Redshop Studio are the earliest recordings that would be released under The Waterboys name. During the same period, Scott formed the short-lived band The Red and the Black, with saxophone player Anthony Thistlethwaite, after hearing him play on \"Waiting on Egypt\", a Nikki Sudden album. The Red and the Black performed nine concerts in London. Thistlethwaite introduced Scott to drummer Kevin Wilkinson, who joined The Red and the Black. During 1982, Scott made a number of recordings, both solo and with Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson. These recording sessions, both of Scott's solo work and the group performances, would later be divided between The Waterboys' first and second albums.\n\nIn 1983, even though Scott's record label, Ensign Records, expected his first album to be a solo effort, Scott decided to start a new band. He chose The Waterboys as its name from a line in the Lou Reed song \"The Kids\" on the album \"Berlin\". In March 1983, Ensign released the first recording under the new band name, a single titled \"A Girl Called Johnny\", the A-side of which was a tribute to Patti Smith. This was followed in May by The Waterboys' first performance as a group, on the BBC's \"Old Grey Whistle Test\". The BBC performance included a new member, keyboard player Karl Wallinger. The Waterboys released their self-titled debut, \"The Waterboys\", in July 1983. Their music, influenced by Patti Smith, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, was compared by critics to Van Morrison and U2 in its cinematic sweep.\n\nAfter the release of their debut The Waterboys began touring. Their first show was at the Batschkapp Club in Frankfurt in February 1984. The band then consisted of Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Anthony Thistlethwaite on saxophone and mandolin, Wallinger on keyboards, Roddy Lorimer on trumpets, Martyn Swain on bass and Kevin Wilkinson on drums. John Caldwell from Another Pretty Face also played guitar, and Scottish singer Eddi Reader sang backing vocals for the band's first two concerts. The band made some new recordings and over-dubbed old material in late 1983 and early 1984 which were released as The Waterboys' second album, \"A Pagan Place\", in June 1984. The \"official\" Waterboys line-up at this time, according to the sleeve of \"A Pagan Place\", was Scott, Thistlethwaite, Wallinger and Wilkinson, with guest contributions from Reader, Lorimer and many others.\n\n\"A Pagan Place\" was preceded by the single \"The Big Music\". \"The Big Music\", the name of the single's A-side track, was adopted by some commentators as a description of The Waterboys' sound, and is still used to refer to the musical style of their first three albums. The release of the album was followed by further touring including support for The Pretenders and U2 and a show at the Glastonbury Festival.\n\nThe band began to record new material in early 1985 for a new album, with Wilkinson leaving the band to join China Crisis. Late in the sessions future Waterboy Steve Wickham added his violin to the track \"The Pan Within\"; he had been invited after Scott had heard him on a Sinéad O'Connor demo recorded at Karl Wallinger's house.\n\nThe Waterboys (officially a trio of Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wallinger with a slew of guests) released their third album, \"This Is the Sea\", in October 1985. It sold better than either of the two earlier albums, and managed to get into the Top Forty. A single from it, \"The Whole of the Moon\", reached number 26 in the UK. Promotion efforts were hampered by Scott's refusal to perform on \"Top of the Pops\", which insisted that its performers lip sync. (However, in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, when the New Wave era started around this period, the group's biggest hit single out of this third album was \"The Pan Within\", aside from \"The Whole of the Moon\" and \"Don't Bang The Drum\".) The album release was followed by successful tours of the UK and North America with Wickham becoming a full-time member, Marco Sin replacing Martyn Swain on bass, and Chris Whitten replacing Kevin Wilkinson on drums. Towards the end of the tour Wallinger left to form his own band, World Party, and was replaced by Guy Chambers. At the same time, drummer Dave Ruffy replaced Chris Whitten.\n\nAt the invitation of new member Steve Wickham, Mike Scott moved to Dublin and quickly became influenced by the traditional Irish music there as well as by country and gospel. The band's line-up changed once again with Scott, Wickham and Thistlethwaite now joined by Trevor Hutchinson on bass and Peter McKinney on drums. The new band, which the official Waterboys' website refers to as the \"Raggle Taggle band\" line-up, spent 1986 and 1987 recording in Dublin and touring the UK, Ireland, Europe and Israel. Some of these performances were released in 1998 on \"The Live Adventures of the Waterboys\", including a famous Glastonbury performance in 1986.\n\nIn 1988 Scott took the band to Spiddal in the west of Ireland where they set up a recording studio in Spiddal House to finish recording their new album. \"Fisherman's Blues\" was released in October 1988 and showcased many guest musicians that had played with the band in Dublin and Spiddal. Critics and fans were split between those embracing the new influence of Irish and Scottish folk music and others disappointed after hoping for a continuation of the style of \"This Is the Sea\". \"World Music: The Rough Guide\" notes that \"some cynics claim that Scotsman Mike Scott gave Irish music back to the Irish... his impact can't be underestimated\", but Scott himself explains that it was the Irish tradition that influenced him; \"I was in love with Ireland. Every day was a new adventure, it was mythical... Being part of a brotherhood of musicians was a great thing in those days, with all the many musicians of all stripes we befriended in Ireland. I still have that connection to the Irish musicians and tap into it...\" Owing to the large number of tracks that were recorded in the three years between \"This Is the Sea\" and \"Fisherman's Blues\", The Waterboys released a second album of songs from this period in 2001, titled \"Too Close to Heaven\" (or \"Fisherman's Blues, Part 2\" in North America), and more material was released as bonus tracks for the 2006 reissue of the remastered \"Fisherman's Blues\" album.\n\nAfter further touring the band returned to Spiddal to record a new album. The Waterboys now consisted of Mike Scott, Steve Wickham, Anthony Thistlethwaite, Colin Blakey on whistle, flute and piano, Sharon Shannon on accordion, Trevor Hutchinson on bass and Noel Bridgeman on drums. Their fifth album, \"Room to Roam\" was released in September 1990. One of the album's tracks was a recording of the traditional ballad \"The Raggle Taggle Gypsy\".\n\nJust before \"Room to Roam\" was released, Wickham left over a disagreement with Scott and Thistlethwaite regarding the future direction of the band's sound. Scott and Thistlethwaite wanted to move the band back to a more rock and roll style, and Wickham disagreed. His departure started the band's dissolution, and in his wake Shannon and Blakey both left. Scott, Thistlethwaite and Hutchinson recruited Ken Blevins on drums to fulfil the group's tour dates.\n\nTrevor Hutchinson left the band in 1991, a year that also saw a re-release of the single \"The Whole of the Moon\" from \"This Is the Sea\". The single reached number three on the United Kingdom charts. Scott spent the rest of the year writing new material and moved to New York. Thistlethwaite left the band in December, leaving Mike Scott as The Waterboys' only member. The next album was completed with session musicians and was released in 1993 as \"Dream Harder\" with a new hard rock-influenced sound, and produced two UK Top 30 singles ('The Return of Pan' and 'Glastonbury Song'). Frustrated by not being able to get a new touring Waterboys band together, Scott left New York, abandoning the \"Waterboys\" name and embarking upon a solo career.\n\nHowever, Scott later resurrected the Waterboys name, citing its recognition amongst fans, for the 2000 album \"A Rock in the Weary Land\". The album had a new, experimental rock sound, inspired by contemporary bands Radiohead and Beck that \"shocked\" some listeners. Scott described the new sound as \"Sonic Rock\". A number of old Waterboys guested on the album including Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson. By 2001 the core of the new Waterboys included Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Richard Naiff on keyboards and organs and Wickham, who had returned to the band, on violin. The group changed direction once again in 2003 and released \"Universal Hall\" a mostly acoustic album with a return of some Celtic influences from the \"Fisherman's Blues\" era. The album was followed by a tour of the UK and then Europe. Their first official live album, \"Karma to Burn\", was released in 2005. A new studio album, \"Book of Lightning\", was released 2 April 2007.\n\nHaving harboured the idea for 20 years, Mike Scott set 20 W.B. Yeats poems to music in an enterprise that evolved into a show entitled \"An Appointment With Mr. Yeats\". The Waterboys held the world premiere from 15 to 20 March 2010 in Yeats's own theatre, the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. The five-night show quickly sold out, later receiving several rave reviews, among which were The Irish Times and Irish Actor/Playwright Michael Harding. The performances boasted an eclectic mix of musicians that involved Irish rock singer Katie Kim, Irish Singer/Writer/Guitarist Joe Chester, and Simon Wallace (keyboards). Some of the poems performed include 'The Hosting of the Sidhe', 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree', 'News for the Delphic Oracle', and 'The Song of Wandering Aengus', along with an amalgamation of two Yeats lyrics that became the song 'Let the Earth Bear Witness' which Scott had produced during 'The Sea of Green' 2009 Iranian election protests. The musical arrangements for the poems were varied and experimental.\nOn the band's website Scott described the arrangements as \"psychedelic, intense, kaleidescopic, a mix of rock, folk and faery music,\" the delivery of which signals yet another musical shift in the ever mutable world of The Waterboys.\n\n\"An Appointment With Mr. Yeats\" returned to Dublin on 7 November 2010 in the city's Grand Canal Theatre. The show was performed at the Barbican Hall, London in February 2011. The album version of \"An Appointment With Mr. Yeats\" was released on 19 September 2011 and reached the UK Top 30.\n\nIn October 2014, the band announced a new album \"Modern Blues\", which was first released on 19 January 2015 in the United Kingdom, and was released on April 7 in North America. The album was recorded in Nashville, and produced by Mike Scott and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. The line up includes Paul Brown, David Hood, Ralph Salmins, Zach Ernst, and Steve Wickham. The first UK single from the Modern Blues album was 'November Tale'.\n\nThe Waterboys' lyrics and arrangements reflect Scott's current interests and influences, the latter including the musical sensibilities of other members. Wickham in particular had a tremendous impact on the band's sound after joining the group. In terms of arrangement and instrumentation, rock and roll and Celtic folk music have played the largest roles in the band's sound. Literature and spirituality have played an important role in Scott's lyrics Other contributing factors include punk music's DIY ethic, the British poetic tradition, and Scott's experiences at Findhorn, where he has lived for some years.\n\nThe Waterboys' music can be divided into three distinct styles. The first is represented by the first three albums, released between 1983 and 1985. The band's arrangements during this period, described by Allmusic as a \"rich, dramatic sound... majestic\", and typically referred to as \"The Big Music\", combined the rock and roll sound of early U2 with elements of classical trumpet (Lorimer), jazz saxophone (Thistlethwaite) and contemporary keyboards (Wallinger). Scott emphasised the arrangement's fullness by using production techniques similar to Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\". The archetypal example, the song \"The Big Music\", gave the style its name, but the best-selling example was \"The Whole of the Moon\", the song that the early-1980s Waterboys are best known for and that demonstrates both Wallinger's synthpop keyboard effects and the effectiveness of the brass section of the band.\n\nAfter Wickham's joining and the move to Ireland, the band went three years before releasing another album. \"Fisherman's Blues\", and more particularly \"Room to Roam\", traded \"The Big Music\"'s keyboards and brass for traditional instruments such as tin whistle, flute, fiddle, accordion, harmonica, and bouzouki. Celtic folk music replaced rock as the main inspiration for song arrangements on both albums. \"Rolling Stone\" describes the sound as \"an impressive mixture of rock music and Celtic ruralism..., Beatles and Donovan echoes and, of course, lots of grand guitar, fiddle, mandolin, whistle, flute and accordion playing\". Traditional folk songs were recorded along with those written by Scott. \"The Raggle Taggle Gypsy\", a British folk ballad at least two hundred years old, was recorded on \"Room to Roam\". It became closely associated with the band, much as the song \"The Big Music\" did, and also gave its name to describe the band's character. The recording emphasises how distinctly different the band's music had become in the five years since the last of \"The Big Music\" albums.\n\nAfter the break-up of the \"Raggle Taggle band\", Scott used The Waterboys' name for \"Dream Harder\" and \"A Rock in the Weary Land\". These two albums, separated by seven years and bookending Scott's solo album releases, were both rock albums but with distinctive approaches to that genre. \"Dream Harder\" was described as \"disappointingly mainstream\", whereas the sound of the \"A Rock in the Weary Land\" was inspired by alternative music and was praised by critics. For 2003's \"Universal Hall\", however, Wickham had once again rejoined the band, and that album saw a return of the acoustic folk instrumentation of the late 1980s Waterboys, with the exception of the song \"Seek the Light\", which is instead an idiosyncratic EBM track.\n\nScott, who briefly studied literature and philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, has made heavy use of English literature in his music. The Waterboys have recorded poems set to music by writers including William Butler Yeats (\"The Stolen Child\" and \"Love and Death\"), George MacDonald (\"Room to Roam\"), and Robert Burns (\"Ever to Be Near Ye\"). A member of the Academy of American Poets writes that \"The Waterboys' gift lies in locating Burns and Yeats within a poetic tradition of song, revelry, and celebration, re-invigorating their verses with the energy of contemporary music\". So close is the identification of the Waterboys with their literary influences that the writer also remarks that \"W.B.\", the initials to which Yeats' first and middle names are often shortened, could also stand for \"Waterboys\". The Waterboys returned to W.B. Yeats in March 2010. Having arranged 20 of his poems to music, the band performed them as \"An Appointment With Mr Yeats\" for five nights at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (which Yeats co-founded in 1904).\n\nScott has also a number of poetic tropes in lyrics, including anthropomorphism (e.g. \"Islandman\"), metaphor (e.g. \"A Church Not Made with Hands\", \"The Whole of the Moon\"), and metonymy (e.g. \"Old England\"). The latter song quotes from both Yeats and James Joyce. While the lyrics of the band have explored a large number of themes, symbolic references to water are especially prominent. Water is often referenced in their songs (e.g. \"This Is the Sea\", \"Strange Boat\", \"Fisherman's Blues\"). The Waterboys' logo, first seen on the album cover of \"The Waterboys\", symbolises waves.\n\nThe Waterboys' lyrics show influences from different spiritual traditions. The first is the romantic Neopaganism and esotericism of authors such as Yeats and Dion Fortune, which can be observed in the repeated references to the ancient Greek deity Pan in both \"The Pan Within\" and \"The Return of Pan\". Pan was also featured on the album art for \"Room to Roam\". \"Medicine Bow\", a song from the recording sessions for \"This Is the Sea\", refers to Native American spirituality in its use of the word \"medicine\" to mean spiritual power. Scott's interest in Native American issues is also demonstrated in his preliminary recordings for the group's debut album, which included the songs \"Death Song of the Sioux Parts One & Two\" and \"Bury My Heart\". \"Bury My Heart\" is a reference to Dee Brown's \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\". a history of Native Americans in the western United States. Scott took the traditional Sioux song \"The Earth Only Endures\" from \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\", and set it to new music; the arrangement appears on \"The Secret Life of the Waterboys\". Christian imagery can be seen in the songs \"December\" from \"The Waterboys\", \"The Christ in You\" on \"Universal Hall\", and indirectly in the influence of C. S. Lewis in a number of other songs, but Scott writes that his lyrics are not influenced by Christianity.\n\nScott has also said, \"I've always been interested in spirituality, and I've never joined any religion. And it really turns me off when people from one religion say theirs is the only way. And I believe all religions are just different ways to spirituality. And if you call that universality, well, then I'm all for it.\" Despite Scott's pluralist perspective, The Waterboys have been labelled as \"Christian rock\" by some reviewers and heathens by some Christians .\n\nOver seventy musicians have performed live as a Waterboy. Some have spent only a short time with the band, contributing to a single tour or album, while others have been long-term members with significant contributions. Scott has been the band's lead vocalist, motivating force, and principal songwriter throughout the group's history, but a number of other musicians are closely identified with the band.\n\nAnthony Thistlethwaite was an original member of the band, and remained a member until 1991 when the band broke up, although he also joined a few recording sessions for \"A Rock in the Weary Land\". After Scott and Wickham, Thistlethwaite has more songwriting credits than any other Waterboy. His saxophone, regularly featured in solos, was one half of the early group's distinctive brass section, but he has also played guitar, keyboards and a number of other instruments for the band. He pressed to return The Waterboys to a rock music sound after \"Room to Roam\", but did not appear on \"Dream Harder\", the result of that decision. He is now a member of The Saw Doctors, and has also released three solo albums.\n\nOriginal member Kevin Wilkinson was the band's drummer from 1983–1984, and continued to play in some studio sessions afterwards. His later appeared on \"A Rock in the Weary Land\". He led the rhythm section of the group during its \"Big Music\" phase, sometimes without the assistance of any bass guitar. Scott describes Wilkinson's drumming as \"bright and angular, an unusual sound\".\n\nKarl Wallinger joined the group in 1983, shortly after its formation. He left the group two years later, but in that relatively short period made important contributions to both \"A Pagan Place\" and \"This Is the Sea\". He co-wrote \"Don't Bang the Drum\", the environmentalism anthem on the latter album. His keyboards and synthesiser work expanded the group's sound, and he also did some studio work for demo sessions. Wallinger's World Party project was heavily influenced by his work with The Waterboys.\n\nRoddy Lorimer's participation began in 1983, contributing his trumpet playing \"on and off\" until 1990. He and Thistlethwaite took turns leading the brass section of the band, and Lorimer was also a featured soloist, most famously on \"The Whole of the Moon\" and \"Don't Bang the Drum\". He further contributed backing vocals to the song. His trumpet style is a combination of his classical training with an experimental approach encouraged by Scott. Lorimer returned for some studio work in 2006.\n\nSteve Wickham transformed the group when he joined in 1985; his interest in folk music directly resulted in the band's change of direction. His initial involvement with The Waterboys ended in 1990 when Scott and Thistlethwaite wanted to return to rock and roll, but Wickham rejoined the group again in 2000, and, as of 2007, continues to perform with the band. Described by Scott as \"the world's greatest rock fiddle player\", he has written more songs for the band than anyone other than Scott, including the group's handful of instrumental recordings.\n\nRichard Naiff first recorded with the band in 1999, and joined permanently in 2000. As of 2007, he was a core member, along with Scott and Wickham. He is a classically trained pianist and flautist, and plays keyboards for The Waterboys. Ian McNabb described him as Scott's \"find of the century\" and reviewers have described him as \"phenomenally talented\". Naiff officially left The Waterboys in February 2009 to spend more time with his family.\n\nOther notable past members have included Ian McNabb, leader of Icicle Works; Sharon Shannon, who became Ireland's all-time best-selling traditional musician; the experimental musician Thighpaulsandra, producer Guy Chambers, Patti Smith drummers Jay Dee Daugherty and Carlos Hercules, bassists Steve Walters and Mark Smith who was the band's bassist when he died on 3 November 2009.\n\nThe Waterboys line-up as of 2010 appeared at the world premiere of \"An Appointment With Mr Yeats\" at The Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Along with Scott and Wickham the ensemble included Irish folk-rock singer Katie Kim, Irish singer/writer/guitarist Joe Chester, flautist and member of Flook, Sarah Allen, drummer Ash Soan, keyboards and piano, Simon Wallace, bassist Marc Arciero, Blaise Margail on trombone and Ruby Ashley on the oboe.\n\nThe Waterboys expanded into a 9-piece band in the autumn of 2017 for their tour of the UK, Ireland and Europe. \n\n\n\n\nScott has stated that \"We've had more members I believe than any other band in rock history\" and believes that the nearest challengers are Santana and The Fall.\n\n\n\n"}
