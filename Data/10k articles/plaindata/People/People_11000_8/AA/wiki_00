The gunmen were led by Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, who wanted to bring attention to the murder of his family in 1973. They took 149 hostages and killed radio journalist Maurice Williams. After a 39-hour standoff, the gunmen surrendered and all remaining hostages were released from the District Building (the city hall; now called the John A. Wilson Building), B'nai B'rith headquarters, and the Islamic Center of Washington.\n\nThe gunmen killed 24-year-old Maurice Williams, a radio reporter from WHUR-FM, who stepped off a fifth-floor elevator into the crisis (the fifth floor is where the mayor and Council Chairmen have their offices). The gunmen also shot D.C. Protective Service Division police officer Mack Cantrell, who died in the hospital a few days later of a heart attack. Then-Councilman and future 4-term Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry walked into the hallway after hearing a commotion and was hit by a ricocheted shotgun pellet, which lodged just above his heart. He was taken out through a window and rushed to a hospital.\n\nThe gunmen had several demands. They wanted the government to hand over a group of men who had been convicted of killing seven relatives – mostly children – of takeover leader Hamaas Khaalis. They wanted those that were convicted of killing Malcolm X. They also demanded the cancellation of a premiere of the movie \"Mohammad, Messenger of God\" because they considered it sacrilegious.\n\n\"Time\" magazine noted: \nThat the toll was not higher was in part a tribute to the primary tactic U.S. law enforcement officials are now using to thwart terrorists—patience. But most of all, perhaps, it was due to the courageous intervention of three Muslim ambassadors, Egypt's Ashraf Ghorbal, Pakistan's Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan and Iran's Ardeshir Zahedi.\n\nThe leader of the attack was former national secretary of the Nation of Islam Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. Khaalis was born Ernest McGhee in Indiana in 1921. Discharged from the U.S. Army on grounds of mental instability, he worked as a jazz drummer in New York City before converting to Islam and changing his name to Hamaas Khaalis. He became prominent in the ministries and school of the Nation of Islam and was appointed its national secretary in the early 1950s.\n\nKhaalis split with the Nation of Islam in 1958 to found a rival Islamic organisation, the \"Hanafi Movement\". In 1968, he was arrested for attempted extortion but released on grounds of mental illness.\n\nThe Kokayi family were at the roots of the \"Hanafi Movement\" going back to a conclave at Howard University in 1968, when militant blacks formed a group called the Kokayi family. When the Kokayi family was disbanded, many of its members became members Hamaas' Hanafi American Mussulman's Rifle and Pistol Club, which was given a group membership charter by the National Rifle Association.\n\nIn 1972, he published an open letter attacking the leadership and beliefs of the Nation of Islam. A year later five men broke into Khaalis' Washington, D.C. home and murdered five of his children, his nine-day-old grandson and another man. The murderers were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. Khaalis claimed the men were associated with the Nation of Islam, and that the government had not held the Nation of Islam accountable.\n\nOn March 9, 1977, seven members of Khaalis' group burst into the headquarters of B'nai B'rith, in downtown Washington, several miles south of [Khaalis' headquarters at 7700 16th Street NW, and took over 100 hostages. Less than an hour later, three men entered the Islamic Center of Washington, and took eleven hostages. At 2:20 pm, two Hanafis entered the District Building, three blocks from the White House. They went to the fifth floor looking for important people to take hostage. When an elevator opened the hostage-takers thought they were under assault and fired, killing Maurice Williams, a reporter for WHUR-FM radio, and injuring security guard Mack Cantrell. Then-councilman Marion Barry was struck by a ricochet in the chest, and two others were wounded. \"Throughout the siege Khaalis denounced the Jewish judge who had presided at the trial of his family's killers. 'The Jews control the courts and the press,'\" he repeatedly charged.\n\nKhaalis and his followers wanted those convicted for the 1973 murders handed over to them, presumably for execution. They wanted those that were convicted of killing Malcolm X. They also wanted to receive visits from Muslim leader Warith Deen Mohammed and champion boxer Muhammad Ali, long an active Black Muslim supporter. Khaalis also demanded that he be refunded $750 in legal fees caused by a contempt of court citation issued in response to shouting at one of defendants on trial for murdering seven of his family members. \"Time\" noted: \"He also wanted the recently released film \"Mohammad, Messenger of God\", to be banned on the grounds that it is sacrilegious. Khaalis' concern over the film was thought to have triggered the attack.\" He made this determination about the sacrilegious nature of the film based on the mistaken impression that Mohammad was a character seen or heard in the film, which is not the case. The main characters are relatives whose portrayal is not forbidden by religious tradition. The kidnappers made some of their demands on air by calling the then popular broadcast journalist Max Robinson.\n\nWhen Khaalis was informed that people were worried about the fate of the hostages, Khaalis said, \"Nobody showed any concern when my family was killed several years earlier.\" He told a reporter, \nget on the phone and call President Carter and some of those senators that never sent a call, a condolence message. Do you not realize when my family was wiped out [no] one said one word? Not one. Not even a preacher. Not even a minister. Not even a spiritual advisor. Not even a city council member. So, I'm very glad you're worried now. When they wiped out my family, I didn't hear about your sympathy and emotions. I got a letter the other day from my brother telling me how the brother was swaggering around in jail, the killer of Malcolm, walking around with guards protecting him. Well tell him it's over. Tell him it's payday.\n\nThe money from the contempt of court citation was returned and the movie premiere was cancelled. Convicted killers of his family and Malcolm X were not delivered. Part of the negotiations were conducted by the three Muslim ambassadors, who \"read to the gunmen passages from the Quran that they said demonstrated Islam’s compassion and mercy. They urged the gunmen to surrender.\"\n\nOn the evening of the following day, following a number of phone calls, the three ambassadors, along with a few Washington, D.C. officials (including police commander Joseph O'Brien, who had investigated the murder of Khaalis' children and was trusted by Khaalis) met with the Hanafis. The ambassadors of Pakistan, Iran, and Egypt read the Quran with Khaalis to appeal to his conscience. Finally, Khaalis and the others involved in the hostage taking at the two sites where no one was killed were allowed to be charged and then freed on their own recognizance. All were later tried and convicted, with Khaalis receiving a sentence of 21 to 120 years for his role.\n\nKhaalis died at the Federal Correctional Complex Prison in Butner, North Carolina, on November 13, 2003. Marion Barry recovered from his wounds and was later elected mayor. In 2007, the fifth floor press room at the Wilson Building was named for the slain reporter, Maurice Williams.\n\nJohn W. King wrote about the Hanafi siege in his book, \"The Breeding of Contempt\". The book chronicles the siege and his family's becoming the first African American family in the Federal Witness Protection Program after the massacre of the Khaalis family.\n\nThe siege is mentioned in Joni Mitchell's song \"Otis And Marlena\" from her 1977 album \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\". In the song, the title characters travel \"for sun and fun / While Muslims stick up Washington\".\n\nThe Jonathan Leaf play \"The Caterers\", which was produced Off Broadway in 2005, portrayed a modern-day version of the siege.\n\n"}

His paternal grandfather, Antoine Philippe de Marigny, was a French nobleman, military officer, and geographer. His maternal grandfather, Jean Baptiste d'Estrehan, was the royal treasurer of the colony.\n\nIn 1798, Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans (who became King Louis Philippe in 1830) and his two brothers, the Duke de Montpensier and the Count of Beaujolais, visited the Marigny plantation. By all accounts, they were lavishly entertained by the family. One story recounts that special gold dinner ware was made for the occasion of the Duke of Orleans' visit and was thrown into the river afterward, because no one would be worthy of using it again.\n\nThe visit of the French royal family apparently had a big impact on Marigny, as it is reported as an example of the spoiled life in which he was reared. When he was 15 years old, his father died and Bernard inherited his father's plantation just outside the city gates, east of New Orleans' Vieux Carré. According to historians, \"His every whim [was] indulged while his father was alive, he became as wild and headstrong after his death as an unbacked [wild] mustang, and his guardian, abandoning all idea of control, finally shipped him to England, hoping that life abroad might mend his manners; but in London Bernard's dissipations became only more pyrotechnic, and he spent most of his time at Almack's and other famous gambling places.\"\n\nOne of the things Marigny brought back to New Orleans from England was the dice game Hazard which became popular in a simplified form, known in local dialect as \"\"Crapaud\".\"\n\nMarigny founded the \"Louisiana Race Course,\" now the Fair Grounds Race Course, with Julius C Branch and Henry Augustine Tayloe (son of John Tayloe III of the Octagon House, a leading turfman, founder of the Washington Jockey Club (1798), who imported the great English thoroughbred Diomed who sired Sir Archy-whose progeny include Lexington, Secretariat and American Pharoah; grandson of John Tayloe II who imported Childers (by Flying Childers), Jenny Cameron and Jolly Rogers (three of the most important colonial imports) and who built the grand colonial estate and stud farm Mount Airy) and organized the first races for March 20, 1839, and lasted for five days. \"The First Day was the \"Creole Purse\" for $500, one mile heats; the same day the \"Proprietors Purse\" for $250, one mile heats; and third race \"Sweepstakes\" (See Spirit of Times). Second Day-\"Proprietors Purse\" $1,200—two mile heat; if more than two start the second best to be entitled to $200-but if two, the winner to receive $1,000. Third Day-\"Jockey Club Purse\" $1,800—three mile heats; of which the second best will be entitled to $300, if more than two start-if but two, the winner to receive $1500. Fourth Day-\"Jockey Club Plate\" value $1,500 and $500, -four mile heats-to the winner, and $500 to the second best horse, provided more than two start. Fifth Day-\"Proprietors Purse\" $600—mile heat-best 3 in 5; Same Day-\"The Louisiana Plate\" value $1,000—two mile heats; five year olds and over will carry 100lbs.- four year olds and under their appropriate weight.\"\n\nOn reaching his majority in 1806, Marigny at once had his plantation subdivided and began to develop the Faubourg Marigny. (The Louisiana Purchase had taken place in 1803.) Marigny had many gambling debts; and the smaller the land parcels were, the more there were to sell. The area grew rapidly and lots were sold all the way into the 1820s. Marigny's development was immediately popular. He spent most of 1806 and 1807 at the office of notary Narcisse Broutin selling sixty-foot lots or emplacements to prospective home builders. Marigny famously named the streets of his neighborhood whimsically: Abundance, Peace, History, Poets, Piety, Frenchmen, Greatmen, Goodchildren, Music, Desire, Hope, Love, Pleasure, Duels, and Craps (after the game of chance he introduced to America). \"Though said to be poorly educated in the classics, he christened the main thoroughfare to his house Elysian Fields after Virgil's \"Deathless Residence of the Spirits of the Blessed.\" Others say that Elysian Fields Avenue was named simply as the English translation for the Parisian Avenue des Champs-Élysées.\n\nAs more English-speaking Americans arrived in New Orleans, tensions between them and the settled Creoles began to grow. When two American developers approached Marigny about future commercial development of the city in the area of the Faubourg Marigny, the Creole first agreed, and then reneged by instructing Madame Marigny to stay away from the notary office, thus effectively killing the deal; this was reportedly due to his notorious dislike of the American settlers who were considered uncouth \"parvenus\". This act was seen as extremely bad faith on the part of Marigny, and not only ensured that housing development grew uptown instead of east of the city, but also affected both his finances and his political career: \"Marigny was severely blamed by the rest of the Creole population for thus yielding to his anti-American prejudices. This feeling ultimately worked his political destruction. Thereafter he was not looked on as a safe leader, and when he became a candidate for the governorship, they refused to support him.\"\n\nStrapped for cash, Marigny later sold his lots not only to white Creoles but also to free black Creoles, known as gens de couleur libre. Marigny was also related to one of the most prominent femme de couleur libre (free women of color), his half-sister Eulalie Mandeville Macarty, who was the illegitimate, but well loved daughter of Pierre Enguerrand Philippe De Marigny de Mandeville and Marie Jeanne, who was an enslaved woman from the Marigny household. Eulalie was given her freedom and brought up by her paternal grandparents, who left her well provided. The Bernard de Marigny, as well as other Mandeville de Marigny family members, even testified on Eulalie de Mandeville's behalf following her husband's death, when her in-laws sued Eulalie de Mandeville for her estate. They claimed that legally a femme de couleur libre, such as herself, could not inherit the amount of money she possessed from her late-husband (or life partner, as interracial marriage was illegal). Eulalie countered by arguing that all the money she possessed she and her husband earned as equals and that the majority of their wealth came from her business endeavour from before their marriage. Bernard de Marigny testified in favour of his half-sister and helped her hold on to her wealth, not once but twice, as her late husband's family sued Eulalie de Mandeville again after being dissatisfied with the results of the first trial.\n\nMarigny and Edward Livingston were unable to convince General Andrew Jackson to meet and seek the support of Jean Lafitte to aid in the Battle of New Orleans, whom the British forces had tried to recruit but who, according to Marigny, was more inclined to support the Americans. Lafitte did eventually meet and persuade Jackson of the Baratarian's support, which proved very useful during the campaign, meriting personal and public praise from Jackson.\n\nMarigny served as aide-de-camp for Louisiana governor, William C. C. Claiborne, during the battle of New Orleans\n\nIn 1811, and again in 1814, Marigny was elected to the New Orleans City Council to represent the Fifth Ward. From 1822 to 1823, Marigny served as President of the Louisiana State Senate; and, as there was no Lieutenant Governor, he was next in line of succession to Governor Thomas B. Robertson.\n\nMarigny was aide-de-camp of the prefect Pierre Clément de Laussat, then of Louisiana governor, William C. C. Claiborne, during the battle of New Orleans — whose daughter, Sophronie Louise, later wed Marigny's son, Antoine James de Marigny. He was chairman of the state Senate from Louisiana, 1822 to 1823.\n\nIn 1824, Marigny ran for Governor of Louisiana, but was defeated by Anglo candidate Henry Johnson. He ran again in the gubernatorial election of 1828, but he was defeated by Pierre Derbigny, whom he had supported in the 1820 election. Marigny was at one point a candidate in the special gubernatorial election of 1830, but ultimately he was not on the ballot.\n\nMarigny's land holdings included a sugarcane plantation on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. This region is Saint Tammany Parish, one of the Florida Parishes, lands acquired by the U.S. in 1810, prior to Louisiana's transition to statehood.\n\nToday there are a few ruins of Marigny's 1829 sugar mill; the area comprises Fontainebleau State Park. Fontainebleau was the name Marigny chose for his property, after the Fontainebleau Forest near Paris. In 1834, Marigny de Mandeville laid out the town which bears his family name, Mandeville, Louisiana.\n\nMarigny eventually lost his fortune gambling and died impoverished, in 1868. He was buried at Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1 in New Orleans. (His mother, father, paternal grandfather, and paternal great-grandfather were interred in the St. Louis Cathedral. The engraved slab listing the men's names is one of only two prominent grave monuments located inside the cathedral.)\n\nTwo New Orleans streets are named for him or his family, Marigny and Mandeville.\n\n\n\n"}

The marriage does not seem to have lasted, and Betsey Chamberlain did not use the name \"Wright\" in later years.\nAccording to Harriet Hanson Robinson, who started work in the Lowell mills as a child of ten in 1835, \"Mrs. Chamberlain was a widow, and came to Lowell with three children from some 'community' (probably the Shakers), where she had not been contented. She had inherited Indian blood, and was proud of it. She had long, straight black hair, and walked very erect, with great freedom of movement. One of her sons was afterwards connected with the \"New York Tribune\".\"\n\nLowell was a planned factory town. Under the Lowell System, the company recruited young farm girls to work in the mills, building dormitories where they could live at low rents, and hiring matrons to monitor the social conduct of the girls. The company arranged for cultural events, bible studies and other educational opportunities.\nLowell was rich in educational and cultural opportunities for women at that time. There were libraries and bookstores, evening schools and lectures, concerts and balls. \nTwo of the first magazines written by women were published in the town, the \"Lowell Offering\" (1840-1845) and the \"New England Offering\" (1847-1850).\nChamberlain wrote for both of these journals using the pseudonyms \"Betsey\", \"B.C.\", \"Jemima\", and \"Tabitha.\"\n\nIn 1843 Betsey Chamberlain married Charles Boutwell, a widowed farmer with children of his own.\nThey moved to Illinois, where they began farming.\nShe was back in Lowell in 1848, perhaps to earn cash to help support the farm, and published short pieces in \"The New England Offering\" between December 1848 and February 1850.\nShe returned to Illinois in 1850.\nShe had four husbands in total, dying at the age of eighty-eight.\n\nThirty-three prose works by Chamberlain were published in the \"Lowell Offering\" between 1841 and 1842, and four more in the \"New England Offering\" of 1848.\nA few of her writings, such as the 1842 \"The Indian Pledge\" and \"A Fire-Side Scene\", are among the earliest protests against Indian persecution to be published by native women.\nThe satirical \"A Fire-Side Scene\" is highly critical of the way the government was treating native people, implying that their actions were far from following Christian morality.\nMost of her published pieces are sketches of village life and legends told from a woman's viewpoint, in which she shows great powers of observation, \nbringing her characters vividly to life.\nHarriet Hanson Robinson said of her \"Mrs. Chamberlain was the most original, the most prolific, and the most noted of all the early story-writers. Her writings were characterized, as Mr. Thomas says, 'by humorous incidents and sound common sense,' and is shown by her setting forth of certain utopian schemes of right living.\"\n\n\n"}

Del Castillo was the Program Scientist for the Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program at NASA Headquarters, in Washington, D.C..\n\nDel Castillo was born in San Juan, the capital city of Puerto Rico, and raised in Mayaguez. There he received his primary and secondary education. He lived a humble life and spent most of his youth on or near the Atlantic Ocean. His upbringing near the ocean served as an influential factor when he decided to study biology at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez where in 1987, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Biology.\n\nHe continued to work on a master's degree in Marine Science in the same institution. Del Castillo began studying the effects of oil pollution in the tropical marine environments. His master's thesis dealt with oil pollution and the results of his thesis was presented in a meeting in Rennes, France.\n\nDuring this time period, he also served in the Puerto Rico National Guard and was assigned to the 240th Military Police Company. His military service included deployment to Saudi Arabia during the first Persian Gulf War (August 2, 1990 – February 28, 1991).\n\nUpon his return to Puerto Rico Del Castillo earned his master's degree in Marine Science in 1991. He realized that there was a lack of funding for oil pollution research in Puerto Rico and therefore, he decided to continue his education and research at the University of South Florida. While pursuing his doctorates degree, he became interested in Organic Carbon biogeochemistry. He used remote sensing to study biogeochemical and physical processes in the oceans through a combination of remote sensing and field and laboratory experiments. Del Castillo was offered a position in a laboratory where he was to conduct a series of studies in the Arabian Sea similar to the ones which he had proposed to NASA. In his proposal to NASA, he asked the agency to conduct and study the optical properties of organic matter in the Orinoco River plume. It was his believe that Orinoco River plume was a critical aspect in the use of optical sensors for ocean Biogeochemical research. Del Castillo earned his PhD in Oceanography in 1998, from the University of South Florida and was awarded the William Sackett Prize for Innovation and Excellence in Research.\n\nDel Castillo was offered a position at NASA's Stennis Space Center (SSC), in Mississippi. There he worked as a researcher under the direction of Dr. Rick Miller, who led the Earth Systems Science Office. He began working in the Mississippi River plume and in the application of remote sensors to study coastal environments. He co-edited with Dr's. Richard Miller and Brent McKee, \"Remote Sensing of the Coastal Environment,\" a book which provides extensive insight on remote sensing of coastal waters from aircraft and space-based platforms.\n\nIn 2003, Del Castillo was offered a position as Program Scientist for the Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The temporary position allowed him to learn about policy, and interact with colleagues in academia and other branches of the government.\n\nOn September 9, 2003, National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) announced that Del Castillo would be awarded the prestigious Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) for his research in Ocean Biology. The award, which is bestowed by the NSTC once during an individuals career, was officially given to Del Castillo on May 2004. It is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers.\n\nDel Castillo is a member of NASA's Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Management and Operations working group.

As a child in 1949 he contracted polio. He began classical piano lessons at the age of nine and saxophone by twelve. His interest in jazz was sparked by seeing John Coltrane perform live in New York City clubs such as Birdland, the Village Vanguard and the Half Note. Throughout high school and college, Liebman pursued his jazz interest by studying with Joe Allard, Lennie Tristano, and Charles Lloyd. Upon graduation from New York University (with a degree in American History), he began to seriously devote himself to the full-time pursuit of being a jazz artist.\n\nIn the early 1970s, after recording with Genya Ravan and Ten Wheel Drive, Liebman took the leading role (as President) in organizing several dozen musicians into a cooperative, Free Life Communication, which became an integral part of the fertile New York loft jazz scene in the early 1970s and was funded by The New York State Council of the Arts and the Space for Innovative Development. After one year spent with Ten Wheel Drive, one of the early jazz fusion groups, Liebman secured the saxophone/flute position with the group of John Coltrane's drummer, Elvin Jones. Within two years, Liebman reached the zenith of his apprenticeship period when Miles Davis hired him. These years, 1970–74, were filled with tours and recordings. At the same time, Liebman began exploring his own music, first in the Open Sky Trio with Bob Moses and then with pianist Richie Beirach in the group Lookout Farm. This group recorded for the German-based ECM label as well as A&M Records while touring the U.S., Canada, India, Japan and Europe. Lookout Farm was awarded the number one position in the category \"Group Deserving of Wider Recognition\"in the 1976 \"Down Beat\"'s International Critics' Poll. In these years he also played and recorded with Pee Wee Ellis.\n\nIn 1977, Liebman toured the world with pianist Chick Corea, followed up the next year by the formation of the David Liebman Quintet with John Scofield, Kenny Kirkland and Terumasa Hino as featured sidemen. After several world tours and recordings by the quintet over three years, he reunited with Richard Beirach. They began performing and recording as a duo, as well as creating the group Quest in 1981. Beginning with bassist George Mraz and drummer Al Foster, the group solidified when Ron McClure and Billy Hart joined in 1984. Through 1991, Quest recorded seven CDs, toured extensively and did many workshops with students worldwide.\n\nAfter 23 years with the Dave Liebman Group (featuring guitarist Vic Juris), Liebman formed \"Expansions\" reaching out to the younger generation featuring bassist Tony Marino, pianist Bobby Avey, on reeds Matt Vashlishan and Alex Ritz on drums. Over the past decades, Liebman has often been featured with top European jazz artists such as Joachim Kühn, Daniel Humair, Paolo Fresu, Jon Christensen, Bobo Stenson and in the World View Trio with Austrian drummer Wolfgang Reisenger and French bassist Jean-Paul Celea. His ability to play in so many diverse styles has led to big band and radio orchestra performances with the Brussels Jazz Orchestra, the WDR and NDR in Germany, the Metropole Orchestra of the Netherlands, the new music group Klangforum Wien from Vienna and, most notably, Liebman was the first improviser to perform with the world-famous Ensemble InterContemporain founded by Pierre Boulez in France. On all these occasions, the music is arranged from Liebman's own compositions and improvisations. He has consistently placed among the top finalists in the \"Down Beat\" Critic's and Reader's Polls since 1973 in the Soprano Saxophone category and on occasion, flute. Lieb has been featured on several hundred recordings of which he has been the leader or co-leader on over one hundred. Nearly three hundred original compositions have been recorded. His artistic output has ranged from straight-ahead classic jazz to chamber music, from fusion to avant garde, with numerous CDs featuring original arrangements of the music of Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Coltrane, Kurt Weill, Alec Wilder, Cole Porter, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Puccini and the Beatles.\n\nLiebman has published material on a variety of subjects including instructional DVDs. He has also published chamber music and over the years has contributed regularly to various periodicals, such as the \"Saxophone Journal\" and the \"International Association of Jazz Educators Journal.\" He is the author of several milestone books: \"Self Portrait of a Jazz Artist\", \"Jazz Connections: Miles Davis and David Liebman\", \"A Chromatic Approach to Jazz Harmony and Melody\", and \"Developing a Personal Saxophone Sound.\" Several of these books have been translated to other languages.\n\nHis teaching activities at universities and in clinic settings have taken him literally around the world as a result of his varied musical directions and expertise on several instruments, along with an ability to articulate the intricacies of the jazz language, aesthetic and technique. Over the years, he has regularly received grantees to study with him funded by the NEA (U.S.), the Canadian Arts Council, as well as Arts Councils of numerous European countries. In 1989, he founded the International Association of Schools of Jazz (IASJ), an organization dedicated to networking educators and students from international jazz schools through periodic meetings, exchange programs and newsletters. Liebman presently serves as the Artistic Director of the IASJ. He scored music for the JazzEx Ballet Company in the Netherlands in the early 1990s and \"Ocean of Light\" for Katrina and the tsunami tragedies in 2006. Currently, Liebman is the Artist in Residence at the Manhattan School of Music and will be visiting Artist at the University of Toronto for year 2014–15.\n\nLiebman and musicologist Lewis Porter teamed up to develop \"What It Is: The Life of a Jazz Artist\", Liebman's biography. Released in March 2012, the book was well received by jazz critics.\n\nIn 1989 he was the Artistic Director of the International Association of Schools of Jazz. He was an Artist in Residence at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City, and held an annual Saxophone/Chromatic Harmony Master class held at East Stroudsurg University since 1987. He recorded extensively for Double-Time Records during the 1990s.\n\nDave Liebmann in Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n\n"}

Though Sanborn has worked in many genres, his solo recordings typically blend jazz with instrumental pop and R&B. He released his first solo album \"Taking Off\" in 1975, but has been playing the saxophone since before he was in high school.\n\nOne of the most commercially successful American saxophonists to earn prominence since the 1980s, Sanborn is described by critic Scott Yannow as \"the most influential saxophonist on pop, R&B, and crossover players of the past 20 years.\" He is often identified with radio-friendly smooth jazz, but he has expressed a disinclination for the genre and his association with it.\n\nSanborn was born in Tampa, Florida, and grew up in Kirkwood, Missouri. He suffered from polio for eight years in his youth. He began playing saxophone on a physician's advice to strengthen his weakened chest muscles and improve his breathing. Alto saxophonist Hank Crawford, at the time a member of Ray Charles's band, was an early and lasting influence on Sanborn.\n\nSanborn attended college at Northwestern University and studied music. But he transferred to the University of Iowa where he played and studied with saxophonist J.R. Monterose.\n\nSanborn performed with blues musicians Albert King and Little Milton at the age of 14. He continued playing blues when he joined Paul Butterfield's band in 1967. Sanborn recorded on four Butterfield albums as a horn section member and soloist from 1967 to 1971.\n\nIn the mid-70s and playing bebop Sanborn became prominent in the newly popular jazz/funk scene by joining the Brecker Brothers band where he became influenced by Michael Brecker, and it was with the brothers that he recorded his first solo album, 'Taking Off', nowadays regarded as something of a jazz/funk classic. Although Sanborn is most associated with smooth jazz, he studied free jazz in his youth with saxophonists Roscoe Mitchell and Julius Hemphill. In 1993, he revisited this genre when he appeared on Tim Berne's \"Diminutive Mysteries\", dedicated to Hemphill. Sanborn's album \"Another Hand\" featured avant-garde musicians.\n\nIn 1985 Sanborn and Al Jarreau played two sold-out concerts at Chastain Park in Atlanta.\n\nHe has been a highly regarded session player since the late 1960s, playing with an array of well-known artists, such as James Brown, Bryan Ferry, Michael Stanley, Eric Clapton, Bobby Charles, Cat Stevens, Roger Daltrey, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Jaco Pastorius, the Brecker Brothers, Michael Franks, Kenny Loggins, Casiopea, Players Association, David Bowie, Todd Rundgren, Bruce Springsteen, Little Feat, Tommy Bolin, Bob James, James Taylor, Al Jarreau, Pure Prairie League, Kenny G, Loudon Wainwright III, George Benson, Joe Beck, Donny Hathaway, Elton John, Gil Evans, Carly Simon, Guru, Linda Ronstadt, Billy Joel, Kenny Garrett, Roger Waters, Steely Dan, Ween, the Eagles, The Grateful Dead, Nena, Utada Hikaru, The Rolling Stones, Ian Hunter, and Toto.\n\nHis solo recordings have often featured the bassist/multi-instrumentalist and producer Marcus Miller. He has also done some film scoring for films such as \"Lethal Weapon\" (and its sequels) and \"Scrooged\". In 1991 Sanborn recorded \"Another Hand\", which the \"All Music Guide to Jazz\" described as a \"return by Sanborn to his real, true love: unadorned (or only partly adorned) jazz\" that \"balanced the scales\" against his smooth jazz material. The album, produced by Hal Willner, featured musicians from outside the smooth jazz scene, such as Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Bill Frisell, and Marc Ribot.\n\nIn 1994 Sanborn appeared in \"\", also known as \"Daltrey Sings Townshend\". This was a two-night concert at Carnegie Hall produced by Roger Daltrey of English rock band The Who in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. In 1994 a CD and a VHS video were issued, and in 1998 a DVD was released. In 1995 he performed in \"\" a musical performance of the popular story at Lincoln Center to benefit the Children's Defense Fund. The performance was broadcast on Turner Network Television (TNT) and issued on CD and video in 1996.\n\nIn 2006, he was featured in Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band's album \"The Phat Pack\" on the track \"Play That Funky Music\", a remake of the Wild Cherry hit in a big band style. Sanborn often performs at Japan's Blue Note venues in Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo. He plays on the song \"Your Party\" on Ween's 2007 release \"La Cucaracha\". On April 8, 2007, Sanborn sat in with the Allman Brothers Band during their annual run at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. In 2010, Sanborn toured primarily with a trio featuring jazz organist Joey DeFrancesco and Steve Gadd where they played the combination of blues and jazz from his album \"Only Everything\". In 2011, Sanborn toured with keyboardist George Duke and bassist Marcus Miller as the group DMS.\n\nSanborn has performed on both radio and television broadcasts; he has also acted as a host. From the late 1980s he was a regular guest member of Paul Shaffer's band on \"Late Night with David Letterman\". He also appeared a few times on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" in the 90s. From 1988–89, he co-hosted \"Night Music\", a late-night music show on NBC television with Jools Holland. Following producer Hal Willner's eclectic approach, the show positioned Sanborn with many famed musicians, such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Pharoah Sanders, Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, Lou Reed, Elliott Sharp, Jean-Luc Ponty, Santana, Todd Rundgren, Youssou N'dour, Pere Ubu, Loudon Wainwright III, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Leonard Cohen, Was, John Zorn, and Curtis Mayfield. During the 1980s and 1990s, Sanborn hosted a syndicated radio program, \"The Jazz Show with David Sanborn\". Sanborn has recorded many shows' theme songs (most notably the one for \"L.A. Law\") as well as several other songs for \"The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder\".\n\nHe has won six Grammy Awards and has had eight gold albums and one platinum album.\n\nSanborn won Grammy Awards for \"Voyeur\" (1981), \"Double Vision\" (1986) and the instrumental album \"Close Up\" (1988).\n\nIn 2004, Sanborn was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\n\nWith Joe Beck\n\nWith George Benson\n\nWith David Bowie\n\nWith the Brecker Brothers\n\nWith Paul Butterfield\n\nWith the Eagles\n\nWith Gil Evans\n\nWith Maynard Ferguson\n\nWith Michael Franks\n\nWith Bob James\n\nWith Steve Khan\n\nWith Lisa Lauren\nWith O'Donel Levy\n\nWith Pure Prairie League\n\nWith Carly Simon\n\nWith Mike Stern\n\nWith James Taylor\n\nWith John Tropea\n\nWith others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels. Lenin was given a state funeral and then buried in a specially erected mausoleum on 27 January. A commission of the Central Committee of the RCP(b) was in charge of organizing the funeral.\n\nOn 23 January, the coffin with Lenin's body was transported by train from Gorki to Moscow and displayed at the Hall of Columns in the House of the Unions, and it stayed there for three days. On 27 January, the body of Lenin was delivered to Red Square, accompanied by martial music. There assembled crowds listened to a series of speeches delivered by Mikhail Kalinin, Grigory Zinoviev and Joseph Stalin, but notably not Leon Trotsky, who had been convalescing in the Caucasus. Afterwards the body was placed into the vault of a temporary wooden mausoleum (soon to be replaced with present-day Lenin's Mausoleum), by the Kremlin Wall. Despite the freezing temperatures, tens of thousands attended.\n\nThe commander of the Moscow Garrison issued an order to place the guard of honour at the mausoleum. The people called it the \"Number One Sentry\". After the events of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the guard of honour was disbanded.\n\nAgainst protestations of Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin's widow, Lenin's body was embalmed to preserve it for long-term public display in the Red Square mausoleum. During this process, Lenin's brain was removed; in 1925 an institute was established to dissect it, revealing that Lenin had suffered from severe sclerosis.\n\nRussian MP Vladimir Petrov suggested in 2018 that Lenin’s body be buried in 2024, the 100th anniversary of his death, because it was costing the state too much money to house the body in the mausoleum. The body would be replaced with a wax or rubber model of Lenin. \n\n"}

He killed a total of four officers in the course of resisting capture, two at his house, and two who tried to apprehend him during an 11-day manhunt in the Beartooth Mountains (near the mouth of Clarks Fork Canyon) of Wyoming.\n\nWalter Earl Durand was born in 1913 to parents who were farmers in Powell, Wyoming, where he grew up. He learned all about farming and hunting.\n\nHe was a mountain man who lived off the land in the mountains of Wyoming during the years following the Great Depression. He was arrested for poaching elk, as he did not believe in the new hunting license system and refused to get a license.\n\nWhile in jail in Cody, Wyoming, Durand escaped by taking a Deputy sheriff/Jailer's gun and forcing the officer to drive him into the countryside before he returned to his home. Durand shot and killed two police officers who came to his house to take him back to jail; then he armed himself and headed into the wilderness of the Beartooth Mountains.\n\nThe prosecutor initially deputized 10 men to form a posse to find and bring Durand in for trial. Durand shot and killed two of the possemen who were searching for him. The manhunt grew to include the FBI, sharp shooters, the Wyoming National Guard with artillery from Fort Warren, civilians, and an airplane fitted with tear gas and dynamite bombs.\n\nDuring the manhunt, Durand eluded the pursuers for several days. He car-jacked a vehicle and drove it to Powell, where he attempted to rob a bank. He spent several minutes shooting at the windows and walls of the bank. Durand took several hostages, one of whom was killed by a citizen trying to shoot and take down Durand as they left the bank. After being shot by Tip Cox, Durand crawled back into the bank; there he killed himself with a shot to the neck.\n\nThe 11-day manhunt was widely covered by the national press, with Durand being nicknamed \"Tarzan of the Tetons\". Inspired by the manhunt, the film \"Wyoming Outlaw\" was rapidly produced: the B movie starring John Wayne appeared in theaters 3 months after Durand's death. Durand was later portrayed by Peter Haskell in a Hollywood biopic, \"The Legend of Earl Durand\" (1974).\n"}

Noted for his activities with the Filiki Eteria in the Danubian Principalities, he is considered to be a leading figure of the Greek Revolution.\n\nOlympios was of Aromanian origin. He was born in the village of Livadi, near Larissa, on Mount Olympus, in Ottoman-ruled Greece. After joining the \"Armatolikia\" in the Olympus area around the age of 20, Olympios became a prominent member of the local society by protecting villages from the Ali Pasha's raids, when the powerful Pasha started expanding his authority out of Epirus. In 1798, however, he was forced to abandon his birthplace, due to Ali Pasha's hostility towards him, and fled to Serbia, where he collaborated for some time with Karađorđe Petrović during the First Serbian Uprising (he is known in Serbia as Kapetan Jorgać, \"Captain Giorgakis\").\n\nOlympios became a supporter of the ideas diffused by Rigas Feraios for a common Balkan revolution against the Ottoman rule, and moved to Wallachia. There, with the help of Constantine Ypsilantis, he composed a military force of Greeks to fight alongside the Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1806. After the Battle of Ostrova, he was named a \"Polkovnik\" in the Russian Army. Emperor Alexander I included him in the Russian military escort during the Congress of Vienna, where Olympios met with Alexander Ypsilantis, a Filiki Eteria leader.\n\nOlympios entered Filiki Eteria in 1817, taking the high rank of \"Shepherd\". He initiated many others in the Eteria, and established contacts with the Wallachian Pandur Tudor Vladimirescu, who led the parallel uprising of 1821. Olympios married Čučuk Stana, the widow of Hajduk Veljko, who had arrived from Serbia to participate in the Greek War of Independence as a fighter, alongside his own men. They had three children: sons Milanos and Alexandros and daughter Euphrosyne.\n\nAt the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, when the Eteria began its expedition in Moldavia and Wallachia, Olympios was appointed leader of the Greek forces in Bucharest by Alexander Ypsilantis, at first cooperating with Tudor Vladimirescu, who led the parallel Wallachian uprising. However, when Vladimirescu distanced himself from the Fililiki Eteria, Olympios was responsible for his arrest on 1 June in Goleşti - following which Vladimirescu was summarily put to death .\n\nHe took part in the Battle of Sculeni on 29 June 1821, when Ottoman forces chased him (along with Yiannis Pharmakis and a small force of 400 Greeks) to the Secu Monastery in the Neamț County, where the Greeks made their last stand. Olympios died during the Ottoman attack on the monastery. His widow and children fled to Khotyn, then part of the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire, where other people of the Serbian- and Greek War, had taken refuge.

His thesis work “La Truite” (“The Trout”, 1987) was purchased by the Japanese Ministry of Culture. His second work, “The Salmon”, 1989 by the Daiwa Bank.\nDuring this phase, he oriented his work strongly toward the European Renaissance, in which his human forms are evocative of Albrecht Dürer or Matthias Grünewald, in combination with his conceptions of fish and water.\nAfter his academic studies he worked for one year as a research assistant in the Department of Oil Painting, Technique and Materials.\n\nIn subsequent years he created more surreal and expressive oil paintings. Simultaneously, from 1983 to 1992, he worked as a muralist for the department store Shibuya PARCO in Tokyo. Later in his writings, he called this job Kaisha ni okeru katsudō (in English, “the establishment-concerned workings”). On surfaces of 4.5 x 13m, respectively, 4.5 x 9m, he painted advertisements for various products on the exterior walls of the department store.

Next to his many early works, oil paintings created using his lapis lazuli technique were also shown. In addition, the collection of tea ceremony utensils was presented for the first time. It consists of 30 ceremonial teacups fired with lapis lazuli pigment. Also included were accessories in bamboo and wood, which were lacquered with lapis lazuli pigment.\n\nFor Hiroshi Onishi the link between Eastern and Western painting was a central theme.\nA part of his work is now in Germany with his widow, Martina Wagner-Onishi.\n\n\n\nOn the occasion of the 120th Anniversary of the Tokyo University of the Arts, a four-day event\n„Geidai Chakai“ (tea convention of the Geidai) took place in October 2007.\nFor this event, Hiroshi Onishi created multiple implements for tea ceremonies, among them the first teacup fired with a glaze of lapislazuli pigment.

Huang came in contact with the Tongmenghui while studying at the Tokyo Shimbu Gakko, a military academy in Tokyo in 1905 and met Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Qun in 1907 when they arrived to study in Japan as well. In 1908, he studied surveying under the Imperial Japanese Army, and returned to China in 1910.\nDuring the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, he and Chen Qimei declared Shanghai to be independent of the Empire of China, and became blood brothers with Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nHe was forced to flee abroad after the failed Second Revolution of 1913 against Yuan Shikai, travelling via Japan to the United States, and returned in 1916 to participate in the final stages of the National Protection War, and to represent Zhejiang's military government in Beijing. When Sun Yatsen ordered Kuomintang members to swear personal loyalty to him, Huang objected and left politics.\n\nHuang reappeared into public life by supporting China's entry into World War I hoping it would regain lost territories. He worked with President Xu Shichang as a diplomat, co-wrote books about economics and foreign affairs and would often guest lecturer at universities. He was part of China's delegation to the 1921 Washington Naval Conference which secured the Beiyang government's greatest diplomatic triumph, the return of Shandong.\n\nAfter the fall of Cao Kun in the 1924 Beijing coup, he joined the Zhili clique and became acting president of the Republic of China on the request of Feng Yuxiang. He declared Cao Kun's term illegal because it was obtained through bribery and also repudiated the agreement which allowed former Emperor Puyi to continue to live in the Forbidden City.\n\nHuang was influential in winning over Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan to Chiang Kai-shek's faction of the Kuomintang (KMT) which was one of the major reasons why Wang Jingwei's Wuhan regime collapsed. He later served under several offices during the Nanjing decade including Shanghai mayor, foreign minister, and chairman of the North China Political Council. Despite his close ties to Chiang, he never rejoined the KMT as he did not want to be associated with the opportunists who joined during and after the Northern Expedition. In 1933, he signed the unpopular Tanggu Truce which ceded Chahar, Rehe, and part of Hebei to Manchukuo. Like Chiang, he viewed the Communists as a greater threat than the Japanese.\nHuang died of lung cancer in Shanghai in 1936.\n"}

He began his career working as a caricaturist for several Paris journals including \"Le Monde Parisien\" and \"Le rire satirique\". Wanting to expand his horizons, he enrolled at the École des Beaux Arts, studying under Jean-Léon Gérôme as well as another sculptor/painter, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. Forain's quick and often biting wit allowed him to befriend poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine as well as many writers, most notably Joris-Karl Huysmans. He was one of only \"seven known recipients\" to receive a first edition of A Season in Hell directly from Rimbaud. He was the youngest artist to frequent and participate in the feverish debates led by Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas at the Café de la Nouvelle Athènes in Montmartre.\n\nA follower and protégé of Degas, Forain joined the Impressionist circle in time to take part in the fourth independent exhibition in 1879; he participated in four of the eight Impressionist Exhibitions (1879, 1880, 1881 et 1886). Influenced by Impressionist theories on light and color, he depicts scenes of everyday life: his watercolors, pastels, and paintings focused on Parisian popular entertainments and themes of modernity—the racetrack, the ballet, the comic opera, and bustling cafés. Forain is the most famous caricaturist of the \"Belle époque\", and draw, among others, for the Figaro for more than 30 years. From 1898 - 1899 Forain worked as an illustrator for the weekly French magazine Psst...!, a satirical publication to promote the anti-Dreyfus.\n\nAside from being influenced by his friend of over fifty years, Edgar Degas, Forain was greatly influenced by Honoré Daumier; and his treatment of subjects in his drawings for publications such as \"Le Figaro\" and \"Le Courrier Francais\" are often reminiscent of Daumier's. In 1892 he published the first volume of \"La Comédie Parisienne,\" a collection of Forain's illustrations and commentary on the major stories political stories that disrupted France’s Third Republic—such as the anarchic crisis and the Dreyfus affair. In 1891 Forain married the painter Jeanne Bosc with whom he had a son, Jean-Loup, born in 1895.\n\nDuring the first World War, Forain's illustrations honored the patriotism of his contemporaries; and he enlisted in the Section de Camouflage under Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola. In his later years, Forain created numerous scenes of the Law Courts and other Parisian institutions plus social satire caricatures on late 19th and early 20th century French life. In 1931, shortly before his death, he was made a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He was one of France's best known and revered artists during his time and may best be remembered for his numerous drawings chronicling and commenting on Parisian city life at the end of the 19th century. Followers and admirers of Forain's work include Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "297256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297256", "title": "Lin Biao", "text": "Lin Biao\n\nLin Biao (December 5, 1907 – September 13, 1971) was a Marshal of the People's Republic of China who was pivotal in the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, especially in Northeast China. Lin was the general who commanded the decisive Liaoshen and Pingjin Campaigns, in which he co-led the Manchurian Field Army to victory and led the People's Liberation Army into Beijing. He crossed the Yangtze River in 1949, decisively defeated the Kuomintang and took control of the coastal provinces in Southeast China. He ranked third among the Ten Marshals. Zhu De and Peng Dehuai were considered senior to Lin, and Lin ranked directly ahead of He Long and Liu Bocheng.\n\nLin abstained from taking an active role in politics after the civil war ceased in 1949. He led a section of the government's civil bureaucracy as one of the co-serving Deputy Vice Premiers of the People's Republic of China from 1954 onwards, becoming First-ranked Vice Premier from 1964. Lin became more active in politics when named one of the co-serving Vice Chairmen of the Communist Party of China in 1958. He held the three responsibilities of Vice Premier, Vice Chairman and Minister of National Defense from 1959 onwards. Lin became instrumental in creating the foundations for Mao Zedong's cult of personality in the early 1960s, and was rewarded for his service in the Cultural Revolution by being named Mao's designated successor as the sole Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China, from 1966 until his death.\n\nLin died on September 13, 1971, when a Hawker Siddeley Trident he was aboard crashed in Öndörkhaan in Mongolia. The exact events of this \"Lin Biao incident\" have been a source of speculation ever since. The Chinese government's official explanation is that Lin and his family attempted to flee following a botched coup against Mao. Others have argued that they fled out of fear they would be purged, as Lin's relationship with other Communist Party leaders had soured in the final few years of his life. Following Lin's death, he was officially condemned as a traitor by the Communist Party. Since the late 1970s Lin, and Mao's wife Jiang Qing (with her Gang of Four) have been labeled the two major \"counter-revolutionary forces\" of the Cultural Revolution, receiving official blame from the Chinese government.\n\nLin Biao was the son of a prosperous merchant family in Huanggang, Hubei. His name at birth was \"Lin Yurong\". Lin's father opened a small handicrafts factory in the mid-late 1910s, but was forced to close the factory due to \"heavy taxes imposed by local militarists\". After closing the factory, Lin's father worked as a purser aboard a river steamship. Lin entered primary school in 1917, and moved to Shanghai in 1919 to continue his education. As a child, Lin was much more interested in participating in student movements than in pursuing his formal education. Lin transferred to Wuchang Gongjin High School (武昌共进中学) at 15. Lin joined a satellite organization of the Communist Youth League before he graduated high school in 1925. Later in 1925 he participated in the May Thirtieth Movement and enrolled in the newly established Whampoa (Huangpu) Military Academy in Guangzhou.\n\nAs a young cadet, Lin admired the personality of Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), who was then the Principal of the Academy. At Whampoa, Lin also studied under Zhou Enlai, who was eight years older than Lin. Lin had no contact with Zhou after their time in Whampoa, until they met again in Yan'an in the late 1930s. Lin's relationship with Zhou was never especially close, but they rarely opposed each other directly.\n\nAfter graduating from Whampoa in 1926, Lin was assigned to a regiment commanded by Ye Ting. Less than a year after graduating from Whampoa, Lin was ordered to participate in the Northern Expedition, rising from deputy platoon leader to battalion commander in the National Revolutionary Army within a few months. It was during the Northern Expedition that Lin joined the Communist Party. By 1927 Lin was a colonel.\n\nWhen he was 20 Lin married a girl from the countryside with the family name \"Ong\". This marriage was arranged by Lin's parents, and the couple never became close. When Lin left the Kuomintang to become a communist revolutionary, Ong did not accompany Lin, and their marriage effectively ended.\n\nAfter the Kuomintang-Communist split, Lin's commander, Ye Ting, joined forces with He Long and participated in the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927. During the campaign Lin worked as a company commander under a regiment led by Chen Yi. Following the failure of the revolt, Lin escaped to the remote Communist base areas, and joined Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet in 1928. After joining forces with Mao, Lin became one of Mao's closest supporters.\n\nLin became one of the most senior military field commanders within the Jiangxi Soviet. He commanded the First Army Group, and achieved a degree of power comparable to that of Peng Dehuai, who commanded the Third Army Group. According to Comintern representative Otto Braun, Lin was \"politically... a blank sheet on which Mao could write as he pleased\" during this period. After Mao was removed from power in 1932 by his rivals (the 28 Bolsheviks), Lin frequently attended strategic meetings in Mao's name and openly attacked the plans of Mao's enemies.\n\nWithin the Jiangxi Soviet, Lin's First Army Group was the best-equipped and arguably most successful force within the Red Army. Lin's First Army became known for its mobility, and for its ability to execute successful flanking maneuvers. Between 1930 and 1933, Lin's forces captured twice the number of prisoners of war and military equipment as the Third and Fifth Army Groups combined. The successes of Lin's forces are due partially to the division of labour within the Red Army: Lin's forces were more offensive and unorthodox than other groups, allowing Lin to capitalize on other Red Army commanders' successes.\n\nDuring the Communists' defense against Chiang's 1933–34 Fifth Encirclement Campaign, Lin advocated a strategy of protracted guerilla warfare, and opposed the positional warfare advocated by Braun and his supporters. Lin believed that the best way to destroy enemy soldiers was not to pursue them or defend strategic points, but to weaken the enemy through feints, ambushes, encirclements, and surprise attacks. Lin's views generally conformed with the tactics advocated by Mao.\n\nAfter Chiang's forces successfully occupied several strategic locations within the Jiangxi Soviet, in 1934, Lin was one of the first Red Army commanders to publicly advocate the abandonment of the Jiangxi Soviet, but he was opposed by most Red Army commanders, especially Braun and Peng Dehuai. After the Communists finally resolved to abandon their base, later in 1934, Lin continued his position as one of the most successful commanders in the Red Army during the Long March. Under the direction of Mao and Zhou, the Red Army finally arrived at the remote Communist base of Yan'an, Shaanxi, in December 1936.\n\nLin and Peng Dehuai were generally considered the Red Army's best battlefield commanders, and were not rivals during the Long March. Both of them had supported Mao's rise to \"de facto\" leadership at the Zunyi Conference in January 1935. Lin may have become privately dissatisfied with Mao's strategy of constant evasion by the end of the Long March, but continued to support Mao publicly.\n\nThe American journalist Edgar Snow met Lin Biao in the Communist base of Shaanxi in 1936, and wrote about Lin in his book, \"Red Star Over China\". Snow's account focused more on the role of Peng than Lin, evidently having had long conversations with, and devoting two whole chapters to, Peng (more than any individual apart from Mao). But he says of Lin:\n\nLin Biao did not present the bluff, lusty face of Peng Dehuai. He was ten years younger, rather slight, oval-faced, dark, handsome. Peng talked with his men. Lin kept his distance. To many he seemed shy and reserved. There are no stories reflecting warmth and affection for his men. His fellow Red Army commanders respected Lin, but when he spoke, it was all business ...\n\nThe contrast between Mao's top field commanders could hardly have been more sharp, but on the Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from the rear, and stratagems. Peng met the enemy head-on in frontal assaults and fought with such fury that again and again he wiped them out. Peng did not believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish—and more than replenish—any losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.\n\nWith Mao Zedong, Lin Biao shared the distinction of being one of the few Red commanders never wounded. Engaged on the front in more than a hundred battles, in field command for more than 10 years, exposed to every hardship that his men have known, with a reward of $100,000 on his head, he miraculously remained unhurt and in good health.\n\nIn 1932, Lin Biao was given command of the 1st Red Army Corps, which then numbered about 20,000 rifles. It became the most dreaded section of the Red Army. Chiefly due to Lin's extraordinary talent as a tactician, it destroyed, defeated or outmanoeuvered every Government force sent against it and was never broken in battle ...\n\nLike many able Red commanders, Lin has never been outside China, speaks and reads no language but Chinese. Before the age of 30, however, he has already won recognition beyond Red circles. His articles in the Chinese Reds' military magazines ... have been republished, studied and criticised in Nanking (Nanjing) military journals, and also in Japan and Soviet Russia.\n\nLin and Mao generally had a close personal relationship, but some accounts claim that Lin sometimes made disparaging comments about Mao in private, and that Lin's support of Mao was largely for the pursuit of power. After arriving in Yan'an, Lin became the principal of the newly founded Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. In 1937, Lin married one of the students there, a girl named Liu Ximin, who had earned the nickname \"University Flower\".\n\nIn August 1937, Lin was named commander-in-chief of the 115th Division of the Communist 8th Route Army and ordered to aid Yan Xishan's forces in repelling the Japanese invasion of Shanxi. In this capacity, Lin orchestrated the ambush at Pingxingguan in September 1937, which was one of the few battlefield successes for the Chinese in the early period of the Second Sino-Japanese War (known in China as the \"War of Resistance Against Japan\").\n\nIn 1938, while he was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese soldiers who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and \"katana\", which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier was surprised to see a Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him. The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull. After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.\n\nRecovering from his wounds and ill with tuberculosis, Lin left for Moscow at the end of 1938, where he served as the representative of the Communist Party of China to the Executive Committee of the Communist International. He remained in Moscow until February 1942, working on Comintern affairs and writing for its publication. Lin was accompanied by his wife, Liu Ximin, but their relationship deteriorated in Moscow, and Lin eventually returned to Yan'an without her.\n\nWhile in Moscow, Lin became infatuated with Zhou Enlai's adopted daughter, Sun Weishi, who was studying in Moscow from 1938 to 1946. Before returning to China, in 1942, Lin proposed to Sun and promised to divorce his wife, from whom Lin had become estranged. Sun was not able to accept Lin's proposal, but promised to consider marrying Lin after completing her studies. Lin divorced Liu Ximin after returning to China, and married another woman, Ye Qun, in 1943. The relationship between Sun and Ye was notably bad. After returning to Yan'an, Lin was involved in troop training and indoctrination assignments.\n\nLin was absent for most of the fighting during World War II, but was elected the sixth-ranking Central Committee member in 1945 based on his earlier battlefield reputation. After the Japanese surrender, the Communists moved large numbers of troops to Manchuria (Northeast China), and Lin Biao relocated to Manchuria to command the new \"Communist Northeast Military District\". The Soviets transferred captured Japanese military equipment to the Communists, making Lin's army one of the most well-equipped Communist forces in China. By the time that units from the Kuomintang (Nationalists) were able to arrive in the major cities of Manchuria, Lin's forces were already in firm control of most of the countryside and surrounding areas.\n\nBy the end of 1945, Lin had 280,000 troops in Manchuria under his command, but according to Kuomintang estimates only 100,000 of these were regular forces with access to adequate equipment. The KMT also estimated that Lin also had access to 100,000 irregular auxiliaries, whose membership was drawn mainly from unemployed factory workers. Lin avoided decisive confrontations throughout 1945, and he was able to preserve the strength of his army despite criticism from his peers in the Party and the PLA.\n\nFor the sake of bargaining with the Kuomintang in peace negotiations in 1946, Mao ordered Lin to assemble his army to take and defend key cities, which was against the previous strategy of the Red Army. Lin disagreed with this position, but was ordered by Mao to draw the KMT into a decisive battle and \"not give an inch of land\" around Siping, Jilin. In April 15, Lin orchestrated an ambush and forced KMT forces there to withdraw with heavy casualties. When the local KMT commander, Du Yuming, launched a counterattack on April 18, Mao ordered the troops there to hold the city indefinitely. The fighting continued until Mao finally allowed Lin to withdraw on May 19, which Lin did immediately, barely saving his army from encirclement and destruction.\n\nDu pursued Lin's forces to the south bank of the Songhua River, where they halted due to Du's concerns about his army becoming overextended. According to Communist sources, Lin's army lost 15,000 soldiers in the fighting and withdrawal, but Nationalist sources claim that 25,000 soldiers also deserted or surrendered, and that Lin's force of 100,000 irregular auxiliaries suffered from mass desertion during the retreat. On June 10, the two forces agreed to a ceasefire brokered by George Marshall, and fighting temporarily ceased. Mao ordered Lin to counterattack that winter, but Lin refused, replying that his forces were exhausted and not logistically prepared to do so.\n\nWhen Du led the majority of his forces to attack Communist forces on the Korean border in January 1947, Lin finally ordered 20,000 of his soldiers to cross the Songhua River, where they staged guerrilla raids, ambushed relief forces, attacked isolated garrisons, and avoided decisive confrontations with strong units Du sent to defeat them. While they did so, they looted large quantities of supplies and destroyed the infrastructure of the KMT-held territories that they passed through, including bridges, railroads, fortifications, electrical lines, and boats. When Du sent his forces back south, they were ambushed and defeated. When Du requested reinforcements from Chiang Kai-shek, his request was rejected.\n\nOn April 8, Lin moved his headquarters from Harbin to Shuangcheng in order to be closer to the front. On May 5, he held a conference with his subordinates and announced that his armies would change tactics, engage in a large-scale counterattack, and seek to defeat Du's forces in a decisive battle. On May 8, Lin launched the first of his \"three great campaigns\", the Summer Offensive, intending to engage a large garrison at Huaide while a second force positioned itself to ambush the force that would predictably be sent to relieve it. On May 17, they won a major victory and forced the survivors to retreat to Changchun and Siping. By the end of May 1947, Lin's forces had taken control of most of the countryside (everything except for the rail lines and several major cities), infiltrated and destroyed most KMT forces in Manchuria, and re-established contact with isolated Communist forces in southern Liaoning province.\n\nAfter the victory of the Summer Offensive, Lin's forces gained the initiative and Kuomintang defensive strategy became static and reactionary. Lin ordered his forces to besiege Siping, but they suffered very high casualties and made little progress, partially due to the defenders' strong entrenched position and air support, and due to the attackers' poor artillery support (Lin only had seventy pieces of artillery around Siping). Lin's forces broke into the city twice and engaged in street-to-street fighting, but were driven back both times with heavy casualties. By June 19, Lin's assault troops had become increasingly exhausted, and Lin began to rotate them to prevent them from becoming completely ineffective. On June 24, Nationalist reinforcements arrived from the south to lift the siege. Lin recognized that he did not have enough manpower left to defeat them, and on July 1, he ordered his forces to retreat back to the north of the Songhua River.\n\nThe Communists suffered over 30,000 losses at Siping, and may have suffered a desertion rate of over 20% during the withdrawal, while the Nationalist garrison at Siping fell from 20,000 to slightly over 3,000 before the siege was broken. Lin volunteered to write a self-criticism after the defeat. He also criticized his commander at Siping, Li Tianyou, for demonstrating poor tactics and for lacking \"revolutionary spirit\". Despite the army's setbacks he reorganized the army, combining surviving regiments and raising local militia forces to the status of regular units. By the fall of 1947, he had 510,000 soldiers under his command, approximately equal to Nationalist forces in the region.\n\nBefore Du's replacement, Chen Cheng, could cross north and begin an offensive, Lin moved his army south and began the Autumn Offensive, in which his forces destroyed rail lines and other infrastructure, attacked isolated Nationalist units, and attempted to provoke and ambush strong Nationalist forces. Chen's forces responded to the campaign by withdrawing into their city garrisons. The Communists were not able to provoke a decisive confrontation, and the Autumn Offensive ended in a stalemate.\n\nChen's forces remained static and reactionary, at the end of 1947, Lin led his armies back south in his final Liaoshen Campaign, the Winter Offensive. His initial plan was to repeat the goal of his last offensive, to besiege Jilin City and ambush its relief force, but after reviewing Kuomintang troop dispositions he determined that southern Manchuria would be an easier target. On December 15, Lin's forces attacked Fakui, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun. Chen sent reinforcements to relieve Fakui, and when the Communist ambush failed, Lin ordered his forces to withdraw and join in the siege of Zhangwu. When Chen did not intervene and the town fell on December 28, Lin assumed the main part of the campaign was over and he dispersed his forces to rest and attack secondary targets.\n\nChen saw Lin's withdrawal as an opportunity to seize the offensive. He ordered his forces to attack targets in northern Liaoning on January 1, 1948, and on January 3, Lin successfully encircled the isolated Nationalist 5th Corps. Its commander, Chen Linda, realized that he was being surrounded and requested reinforcements, but Chen Cheng only responded that he would \"allow\" Chen Linda to withdraw. The attempted breakout failed, and the 5th Corps was destroyed on January 7. After this defeat, Chen Cheng was replaced with Wei Lihuang ten days later, but Wei was not able to prevent the Communists from capturing Liaoyang on February 6, destroying the 54th division, and severing an important railroad that linked Wei's forces from their ports on the Bohai Sea.\n\nLin continued his advance, defeating all garrisons in western Manchuria or inducing them to defect by late February. On February 26 Lin reorganized his forces as the Northeastern Field Army and began preparations to return and take Siping, whose garrison had been transferred elsewhere by Chen Cheng and never re-strengthened. Lin began the general assault on the city on March 13, and took the town one day later. The capture of Siping ended Lin's Winter Offensive. The KMT nearly lost all of Manchuria by the end of the campaign and suffered 156,000 casualties, most of which survived as prisoners of war that were indoctrinated and recruited into Lin's forces. By the end of winter 1948 the Kuomintang had lost all of its territory in the Northeast, except for Changchun, Shenyang, and an area connecting the rail line from Beiping to those cities.\n\nFollowing Lin's Winter campaign, Mao wanted him to attack targets farther south, but Lin disagreed because he did not want to leave a strong enemy at his back, and he believed the defeat of a strong city would force Chiang to abandon the Northeast. By May 25, 1948, the Northeastern Field Army had completely encircled Changchun, including its airfield, and for the rest of the siege the Nationalist commander, Zheng Dongguo, depended entirely on supplies airdropped into the city. On May 19, Lin submitted a report to Mao in which he expected heavy casualties. By July 20 the siege was at a stalemate, and Lin deferred to Mao, allowing some of his army to attack Jinzhou farther south, beginning the Liaoshen Campaign. When Chiang airlifted reinforcements to defend Jinzhou, Lin ordered his army to abandon the siege and return to Changchun, but Mao disagreed and overruled him, and Lin was ordered to engage the defenders in a decisive confrontation. On October 14, the Northeast Field Army began its assault on Jinzhou with 250,000 men and the bulk of Lin's artillery and armor. After nearly 24 hours of fighting, Lin's forces were victorious, suffering 24,000 casualties but capturing the enemy commander, Fan Hanjie, and 90,000 enemy soldiers.\n\nAfter hearing the news about the defeat at Jinzhou, a KMT army from Yunnan and its commander, Zeng Zesheng, defected and abandoned its position on the outskirts of Changchun on October 14. This doomed the remaining Nationalist forces in the city, and Zheng Dongguo was forced to surrender two days later. Chiang ordered the 9th army of 110,000 men under General Liao Yaoxiang to travel west and retake Jinzhou, but Lin directed nearly all of his forces to stop them, and they began to encircle the relief unit on October 21. After a week of fighting, the Nationalist army was destroyed on October 28. Remaining KMT garrisons in the Northeast attempted to break out of the region and flee south, but most were unsuccessful. After Changchun, the only major KMT garrison in the Northeast was Shenyang, where 140,000 KMT soldiers were eventually forced to surrender. By the end of 1948 all of Northeast China was under Communist control.\n\nAfter taking control of the Manchurian provinces, Lin then swept into North China. Forces under Lin were responsible for winning two of the three major military victories responsible for the defeat of the Kuomintang. Lin suffered from ongoing periods of serious illness throughout the campaign. Following the victory in Manchuria, Lin commanded over a million soldiers, encircling Chiang's main forces in northern China during the Pingjin Campaign, taking Beijing and Tianjin within a period of two months. Tianjin was taken by force, and on January 22, 1949 General Fu Zuoyi and his army of 400,000 men agreed to surrender Beijing without a battle, and the PLA occupied the city on January 31. The Pingjin Campaign saw Lin remove a total of approximately 520,000 enemy troops from the enemy's battle lines. Many of those who surrendered later joined the PLA.\n\nAfter taking Beijing, the Communists attempted to negotiate for the surrender of the remaining KMT forces. When these negotiations failed, Lin resumed his attacks on the KMT in the southeast. After taking Beijing, Lin's army numbered 1.5 million soldiers. He crossed the Yangtze River in the Spring of 1949 and decisively defeated the defending KMT army stationed in central China during the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. Lin 's armies continued to defeat KMT armies farther south, finally occupying all KMT positions on mainland China by the end of 1949. The last position occupied by Lin's forces was the tropical island of Hainan.\n\nLin Biao was considered one of the Communists' most brilliant generals after the founding of the People's Republic of China, in 1949. Lin was the youngest of the \"Ten Marshals\" named in 1955, a title that recognized Lin's substantial military contributions.\n\nLin Biao continued to suffer from poor health after 1949, and chose to avoid high-profile military and political positions. His status led him to be appointed to a number of high-profile positions throughout most of the 1950s, but these were largely honorary and carried few responsibilities. He generally delegated or neglected many of the formal political responsibilities that he was assigned, usually citing his poor health.\n\nAfter Lin's injury in 1938, he suffered from ongoing physical and mental health problems. His exact medical condition is not well understood, partially because his medical records have never been publicly released. Dr. Li Zhisui, then one of Mao's personal physicians, believed that Lin suffered from neurasthenia and hypochondria. He became ill whenever he perspired, and suffered from phobias about water, wind, cold, light, and noise. He was said to become nervous at the sight of rivers and oceans in traditional Chinese paintings, and suffered from diarrhea, which could be triggered by the sound of running water. Li's account of Lin's condition is notably different from the official Chinese version.\n\nIn another study, Lin is described as having symptoms similar to those seen in patients of schizoid personality disorder. Lin's personality traits including his aloofness, lack of interest in social relationships, secretiveness, and emotional coldness he exhibited during the Cultural Revolution suggest Lin suffered from symptoms similar to those seen in schizoid personality disorder. The challenge of Lin's personality problems in conjunction with the turbulent political climate of the Cultural Revolution impacted his overall ability to govern his position.\n\nLin suffered from excessive headaches, and spent much of his free time consulting Chinese medical texts and preparing traditional Chinese medicines for himself. He suffered from insomnia, and often took sleeping pills. He ate simple meals, did not smoke, and did not drink alcohol. As his condition progressed, his fear of water led to a general refusal to either bathe or eat fruit. Because of his fear of wind and light, his office was gloomy and lacked any ventilation. Some accounts have suggested that Lin became a drug addict, either to opium or morphine.\n\nAs early as 1953, Soviet doctors diagnosed Lin as suffering from manic depression. Lin's wife, Ye Qun, rejected this diagnosis, but it was later confirmed by Chinese doctors. Lin's fragile health made him vulnerable, passive, and easily manipulated by other political figures, notably Ye Qun herself.\n\nLin's complaints got worse with time and age. In the years before his death, the fiancee of Lin's son reported that Lin became extremely distant and socially and politically detached, even to the extent that he never read books or newspapers. His passivity made him difficult to connect with at any meaningful level: \"usually he just sat there, blankly\". In Lin's rare periods of activity, he used his time mostly to complain about, and seek treatment for his large variety of medical issues.\n\nLin, like most of the Politburo, initially held serious reservations about China's entry into the Korean War, citing the devastation that would result if the \"imperialists\" detonated an atomic bomb in Korea or China. Lin later declined to lead forces in Korea, citing his ill health. In early October 1950, Peng Dehuai was named commander of the Chinese forces bound for Korea, and Lin went to the Soviet Union for medical treatment. Lin flew to the Soviet Union with Zhou Enlai and participated in negotiations with Joseph Stalin concerning Soviet support for China's intervention, indicating that Mao retained his trust in Lin.\n\nDue partially to his periods of ill health and physical rehabilitation in the Soviet Union, Lin was slow to rise to power. In the early 1950s Lin was one of five major leaders given responsibility for civil and military affairs, controlling a jurisdiction in central China. In 1953 he was visited by Gao Gang, and was later suspected of supporting him. In 1955 Lin was named to the Politburo. In February 1958 Peng Dehuai, then China's Defense Minister, gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army in which he suggested increasing the military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao wanted to distance China from the Soviet Union, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng. In 1958 Lin joined the Politburo Standing Committee and became one of China's Vice-Chairmen. After the 1959 Lushan Conference, at which Peng criticized Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, Peng was arrested and removed from all government positions. Privately, Lin agreed with Peng and was strongly opposed to Peng being purged, but Lin's fear of being purged himself kept him from publicly opposing Mao's efforts to purge Peng, and Lin publicly condemned Peng as a \"careerist, a conspiracist, and a hypocrite\". Under Mao's direction, Peng was disgraced and put under indefinite house arrest. Lin became the senior leader most publicly supportive of Mao following the Great Leap Forward, during which Mao's economic policies caused an artificial famine in which tens of millions of people starved to death.\n\nLin initially refused to replace Peng, but eventually accepted the position at the insistence of Mao Zedong. As Defense Minister, Lin's command of the PLA was second only to Mao, but he deferred many of his responsibilities to subordinates. The most important figures to whom Lin deferred the day-to-day operations of China's armed forces were Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff, and He Long, the Central Military Vice-Chairman.\n\nAs Defense Minister, Lin's policies differed from those of his predecessor. Lin attempted to reform China's armed forces based on political criteria: he abolished all signs and privileges of rank, purged members considered sympathetic to the USSR, directed soldiers to work part-time as industrial and agricultural workers, and indoctrinated the armed forces in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin's system of indoctrination made it clear the Party was in command of China's armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army's political commissars enjoyed great power and status in order to see that his directives were followed. Lin implemented these reforms in order to please Mao, but privately was concerned that they would weaken the PLA (which they did). Mao strongly approved of these reforms, and conscientiously promoted Lin to a series of high positions.\n\nLin used his position as Minister of Defense to flatter Mao by promoting Mao's cult of personality. Lin devised and ran a number of national Maoist propaganda campaigns based on the PLA, the most successful of which was the \"learn from Lei Feng\" campaign, which Lin began in 1963. Because he was the person most responsible for directing the \"learn from Lei Feng\" campaign, Lin may have directed the forging of \"Lei Feng's Diary\", upon which the propaganda campaign was based.\n\nBecause of Lin's fragile health, Ye Qun controlled many aspects of Lin's public life during the 1960s, including who would see Lin and what others would know about him. Mao encouraged Ye to act on Lin's behalf, giving her an unusual amount of power and responsibility. In 1965 Mao asked Ye to publicly criticize Lin's chief of staff, Luo Ruiqing, on Lin's behalf, even though Ye did not yet hold any high political position. When Lin discovered that Ye had done so (after Luo was purged), he was angry at Ye, but powerless to alter Luo's disgrace.\n\nLin often read speeches prepared by others, and allowed his name to be placed on articles that he did not write, as long as these materials supported Mao. One of the most famous articles published in Lin's name was the 20,000-word pamphlet on revolution in developing countries, \"Long Live the Victory of the People's War!\", which was released in 1965. This article made Lin one of China's leading interpreters of Mao's political theories. The article likened the \"emerging forces\" of the poor in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to the \"rural areas of the world\", while the affluent countries of the West were likened to the \"cities of the world\". Eventually the \"cities\" would be encircled by revolutions in the \"rural areas\", following theories prevalent in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin made no promise that China would fight other people's wars, and foreign revolutionaries were advised to depend mainly on \"self-reliance\".\n\nLin worked closely with Mao, promoting Mao's cult of personality. Lin directed the compilation of some of Chairman Mao's writings into a handbook, the \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong\", which became known as \"the Little Red Book\". Lin Biao's military reforms and the success of the 1962 Sino-Indian War impressed Mao. A propaganda campaign called \"learn from the People's Liberation Army\" followed. In 1966, this campaign widened into the Cultural Revolution.\n\nLin's support impressed Mao, who continued to promote Lin to higher political offices. After Mao's second-in-command, President Liu Shaoqi, was denounced as a \"capitalist roader\" in 1966, Lin Biao emerged as the most likely candidate to replace Liu as Mao's successor. Lin attempted to avoid this promotion, but accepted it on Mao's insistence.\n\nPrivately, Lin opposed the purging of Liu and Deng Xiaoping, on the grounds that they were \"good comrades\", but was not able to publicly oppose Mao's condemnation of them. Lin privately admired Liu, and once told his daughter that Liu had \"a better understanding of theory than Mao\". Zhou Enlai was also considered for the position of Vice-Chairman, but Zhou successfully withdrew from the nomination, leaving Lin the only candidate.\n\nLin also seriously attempted to withdraw from the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again attempted to submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.\n\nBecause there was no way to avoid becoming Mao's second-in-command, Lin attempted to protect himself from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution by giving absolute support to Mao and doing very little else. Lin avoided expressing any opinion, or making any decision on any matter, until Mao's own opinions and positions on that matter were clear, after which Lin would adhere as closely to Mao's direction as possible. Lin made sure that, whenever he and Mao were scheduled to appear in the same place, Lin would always arrive earlier than Mao, waiting to greet the Chairman. Lin attempted to make all observers believe that he was Mao's closest follower, always appearing beside Mao in all of Mao's public appearances with a copy of Mao's \"Little Red Book\". When he was informed that the public's image of Lin was that he was \"Mao's best student\", Lin was pleased, and stated: \"I don't have any talent. What I know, I learned from Mao.\"\n\nBecause Lin had no real interest in the position of Vice-Chairman, he did little other than whatever he believed would ingratiate himself to Mao. Privately, Lin had no interest in promoting the Cultural Revolution, and attended government meetings only when Mao demanded that he do so. Those colleagues closest to Lin noted that Lin avoided talking about the Cultural Revolution in any context other than public speeches, and when pressed would only make very brief and ambiguous statements. After 1966, Lin made no phone calls, received few visitors, secluded himself from his colleagues, and gained a reputation as being \"reticent and mysterious\". He did not take an active role in government, but allowed his secretaries to read short summaries of selected documents for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon. This was generally insufficient to fulfill the responsibilities of vice-chairman, and he left most important work and family duties to his wife, Ye Qun.\n\nLin's passivity was part of a calculated plan to survive the Cultural Revolution alive and well. When Lin perceived that his longtime subordinate, Tao Zhu, was in danger of being purged in the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Lin sent a letter to warn Tao, advising Tao to be \"passive, passive, and passive again\". Tao probably did not understand Lin's advice, and was subsequently purged in 1967. In his relationship with Mao, Lin adopted a policy of \"three 'nos': no responsibility; no suggestions; no crime\".\n\nFollowing the lead of Mao, in 1966 Lin directed Red Guards in Beijing to \"smash those persons in power who are traveling the capitalist road, the bourgeoisie reactionary authorities, and all royalists of the bourgeoisie, and to forcibly destroy the \"four olds\": old culture, old ideas, old customs, and old habits. In August 1966 Lin publicly called for a \"three-month turmoil\" within the PLA, and on October 6 Lin's Central Military Commission issued an urgent instruction that all military academies and institutes were to dismiss their classes and allow their students to become fully involved in the Cultural Revolution. Following the orders of this directive, officers and commissars were expelled from their positions, and some were beaten to death. Students at Chinese military academies followed Lin's instructions to rebel against their senior officers, breaking into the offices of Lin's National Commission for Defense Science to abduct one of the department's directors, and claiming Lin's deputy chief of staff, Li Tianyu, whom students accused of disciplining them. The students \"overthrew\" General Xiao Hua, the head of the PLA's Political Department since the previous July, and went on to purge 40 other top officers working under him in the Political Department, most of whom died in prison.\n\nLin continued to support the Red Guards until May 1967, when Mao accepted Zhou Enlai's appeals to moderate their radical activity through military intervention. Lin moderated some of the most radical activity within the PLA; but, from 1967 to 1969, 80,000 officers were purged, 1,169 of whom died from torture, starvation, or execution. Research programs were cancelled and the number of military academies across China shrank by two-thirds. Many defensive fortifications were destroyed, and regular training within the PLA ceased.\n\nAfter 1966, Lin's few personal political initiatives were efforts to moderate the radical nature of the Cultural Revolution. Privately, he expressed unhappiness with the Cultural Revolution, but was unable to avoid playing a high-profile role due to the expectations of Mao, China's unpredictable political environment, and the manipulations of his wife and son, Ye Qun and Lin Liguo. After 1966, Lin, like Liu before him, attempted to build his own base of support so that he could better position himself for the inevitable, unpredictable political situation that would occur following the death of Mao. Lin's few proactive attempts to direct the Cultural Revolution were attempts to protect Red Guards and his political allies from political persecution, and to mediate the attempts of Jiang Qing and her followers to radicalize China's political climate. In May 1967, Lin's follower, Chen Boda, saved Zhou Enlai from being persecuted by Red Guards by convincing them that Zhou was Lin's follower and supporter. Zhou repaid Lin's assistance by giving him excessive public praise three months later, in August, but was forced to write a formal apology to Lin after Lin complained to Mao that such praise was inappropriate.\n\nLin and Jiang cooperated at the outset of the Cultural Revolution, but their relationship began to deteriorate in 1968 as Jiang frequently attempted to interfere in Chinese military affairs, which Lin found intolerable. By 1970 Lin and Ye were very unfriendly with Jiang Qing: Lin referred to her as a \"long-nosed pit viper\". From 1968 until his death in 1971, Lin and his supporters disagreed with Zhou Enlai and his followers over the issue of China's relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union. Lin believed that both superpowers were equally threatening to China, and that they were colluding to thwart China's interests. Zhou Enlai believed that China should become closer to the United States in order to mitigate the threat posed by the Soviet military. Lin was supported by Jiang Qing in his opposition to pursuing a relationship with the United States, but was not able to permanently disrupt Zhou's efforts to contact the American officials.\n\nLin Biao, as Defense Minister, was responsible for the Chinese response to the Zhenbao Island incident of March 1969, a battle with the Soviet Union over a small, uninhabited island on the border of Mongolia. Lin issued a report labeling the Soviet Union a \"chauvinist\" and \"social imperialist\" power, and issuing orders warning Chinese troops to be wary of an impending Soviet attack. Lin's followers attempted to use the hysteria generated by the incident in an effort to deepen the power that they had gained during the Cultural Revolution, disregarding and acting against the interests of Zhou Enlai and his supporters.\n\nLin officially became China's second-in-charge in April 1969, following the 1st Plenary Session of the 9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Lin's position as Mao's \"closest comrade-in-arms and successor\" was recognized when the Party constitution was formally revised to reflect Lin's future succession. At the 9th Central Committee, Lin's faction was unquestionably dominant within the Politburo. Of the Politburo's twenty-one full members, Lin counted on the support of six members: the generals Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, Qiu Huizo, Ye Qun; and Chen Boda, an ambitious ideologue. Lin's support surpassed the number of members aligned with Jiang Qing, and far surpassed those aligned with Zhou Enlai. Because over 45% of the Central Committee were members of the army, Lin's supporters dominated the Politburo, and Lin's power was second only to Mao's.\n\nDuring the Second Plenary Session of the 9th Central Committee, held in Lushan from August–September 1970, Mao became uncomfortable with Lin's growing power, and began to maneuver against Lin by undermining his supporters and attacking some of Lin's suggestions at the conference. At the Second Plenum, Lin advocated that Chairman Mao take the position of President, which had not been filled in since the removal of Liu Shaoqi, but Mao dismissed this appeal, suspecting Lin of using it to increase his own power. Mao did not attack Lin directly, but showed his displeasure by attacking Lin's ally, Chen Boda, who was quickly disgraced. Lin kept his position, but the events of the Lushan Conference revealed a growing distrust between Lin and Mao.\n\nBecause Lin was one of the most influential figures in promoting Mao's personality cult, he began to be criticized within the Party for its excesses later in 1970. After 1970, some factions within the Army, and those led by Zhou Enlai and Jiang Qing, began to distance themselves from Lin. In order to limit Lin's growing power, Mao approved Zhou's efforts to rehabilitate a number of civilian officials who had been purged during the first years of the Cultural Revolution, and supported Zhou's efforts to improve China's relationship with the United States.\n\nA serious rift developed between Mao and Lin. Mao was displeased with comments that Lin had made about his wife, Jiang Qing, at the Lushan Conference. Generals loyal to Lin refused to accept Mao's criticism of them, and Mao began to question whether Lin continued to follow him unconditionally. Mao wanted Lin to make a self-criticism, but Lin stayed away from Beijing and resisted doing so. Ye Qun made a self-criticism, but it was rejected by Mao as not genuine. Zhou Enlai attempted to mediate between Mao and Lin, but by 1971 Lin had become extremely reclusive and difficult to talk with at any level, and Zhou's mediation failed. In July 1971 Mao decided to remove Lin and his supporters. Zhou again attempted to moderate Mao's resolution to act against Lin, but failed.\n\nLin died when a plane carrying him and several members of his family crashed in Mongolia at 3:00 AM on September 13, 1971, allegedly after attempting to assassinate Mao and defect to the Soviet Union. Following Lin's death, there has been widespread skepticism in the West concerning the official Chinese explanation, but forensic evidence conducted by the USSR (which recovered the bodies following the crash) has confirmed that Lin was among those who died in the crash.\n\nAccording to the Chinese government, Lin Biao was made aware that Mao no longer trusted him after the 9th Central Committee, and he harbored a strong desire to seize supreme power. In February 1971 Lin and his wife, Ye Qun (who was then a Politburo member), began to plot Mao's assassination. In March 1971, Lin's son, Lin Liguo (who was a senior Air Force officer) held a secret meeting with his closest followers at an Air Force base in Shanghai. At this meeting, Lin Liguo and his subordinates supposedly drafted a plan to organize a coup, titled \"Project 571\" (in Chinese, \"5-7-1\" is a homophone for \"armed uprising\"). Later that March, the group met again to formalize the structure of command following the proposed coup.\n\nMao was unaware of the coup plot, and, in August 1971, scheduled a conference for September to determine the political fate of Lin Biao. On August 15 Mao left Beijing to discuss the issue with other senior political and military leaders in southern China. On September 5, Lin received reports that Mao was preparing to purge him. On September 8, Lin gave the order to his subordinates to proceed with the coup.\n\nLin's subordinates planned to assassinate Mao by sabotaging his train before he returned to Beijing, but Mao unexpectedly changed his route on September 11. Mao's bodyguards foiled several subsequent attempts on Mao's life, and Mao safely returned to Beijing in the evening of September 12. By failing to assassinate Mao, Lin's coup attempt failed.\n\nRealizing that Mao was now fully aware of his abortive coup, Lin's party first considered fleeing south to their base of power in Guangzhou, where they would establish an alternate 'Party headquarters' and attack armed forces loyal to Mao in cooperation with the Soviet Union. After hearing that Premier Zhou Enlai was investigating the incident, they abandoned this plan as impractical, and decided to flee to the Soviet Union instead. In the early morning of September 13, Lin Biao, Ye Qun, Lin Liguo, and several personal aides attempted to flee to the Soviet Union and boarded a prearranged Trident 1-E (a CAAC B-256), piloted by Pan Jingyin, the deputy commander of the PLAAF 34th division. The plane did not take aboard enough fuel before taking off, ran out of fuel, and crashed near Öndörkhaan in Mongolia on September 13, 1971. Everyone on board, eight men and one woman, was killed.\n\nThe exact circumstances surrounding Lin's death remain unclear, due to a lack of surviving evidence. Many of the original government records relevant to Lin's death were secretly and intentionally destroyed, with the approval of the Politburo, during the brief period of Hua Guofeng's interregnum in the late 1970s. Among the records destroyed were telephone records, meeting minutes, personal notes, and desk diaries. The records, if they had survived, would have clarified the activities of Mao, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Qing, and Wang Dongxing relative to Lin, before and after Lin's death. Because of the destruction of government documentation related to Lin's death, the Chinese government has relied on alleged confessions of purged officials close to Lin to corroborate the official narrative, but non-Chinese scholars generally regard these confessions as unreliable.\n\nEver since 1971, scholars outside of China have been skeptical of the government's official explanation of the circumstances surrounding Lin's death. Skeptics assert that the official narrative does not sufficiently explain why Lin, one of Mao's closest supporters and one of the most successful Communist generals, would suddenly attempt a poorly planned, abortive coup. The government narrative also does not sufficiently explain how and why Lin's plane crashed. Skeptics have claimed that Lin's decision to flee to the Soviet Union was illogical, on the grounds that the United States or Taiwan would have been safer destinations.\n\nInfluential Western historians critical of the Chinese government's official story have promoted the view that Lin did not have either the intention or the ability to usurp Mao's place within the government or the Party. One theory attempted to explain Lin's flight and death by observing that Lin opposed China's rapprochement with the United States, which Zhou Enlai was organizing with Mao's approval. Because the Chinese government never produced evidence to support their report that Lin was on board the plane that crashed in Mongolia, Western scholars originally doubted that Lin had died in the crash. One book, published anonymously using a Chinese pseudonym in 1983, claimed that Mao had actually had Lin and his wife killed in Beijing, and that Lin Liguo had attempted to escape by air. Other scholars suggested that Mao had ordered the Chinese army to shoot down Lin's plane over Mongolia.\n\nThe Chinese government has no interest in re-evaluating its narrative on Lin Biao's death. When contacted for its comment on fresh evidence that surfaced on the Lin Biao incident after the Cold War, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated: \"China already has a clear, authoritative conclusion about the Lin Biao incident. Other foreign reports of a conjectural nature are groundless.\" Non-Chinese scholars interpreted China's reluctance to consider evidence that contradicts its \"official\" history as the result of a desire to avoid exploring any issue that may lead to criticism of Mao Zedong or a re-evaluation of the Cultural Revolution in general, which may distract China from pursuing economic growth.\n\nA six-month investigation by Western scholars in 1994 examined evidence in Russia, Mongolia, mainland China, the United States, and Taiwan, and came to a number of conclusions, some of which were contrary to the official Chinese version of events. The study confirmed that Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo were all killed in the crash. Lin's plane was travelling \"away\" from the Soviet Union at the time of its crash, making the exact sequence of events before Lin's death more confusing, and casting doubt on the possibility that Lin was attempting to seek asylum in the USSR. Lin's wife and son may have forced Lin to board the plane against his will. Several senior leaders within the Communist Party hierarchy knew that Lin's party would flee, but chose not to attempt to stop their flight. According to this study, Lin had attempted to contact the Kuomintang in Taiwan on two separate occasions shortly before his death. The findings of Lin's attempt to contact the Kuomintang supported earlier rumors from inside China that Lin was secretly negotiating with Chiang's government in order to restore the Kuomintang government in mainland China in return for a high position in the new government. The claims of Lin's contact with the Kuomintang have never been formally confirmed nor denied by either the governments in Beijing or Taipei.\n\nThe eyewitness account of Zhang Ning, who was Lin Liguo's fiancee before his death, and another witness who requested anonymity, indicate a sequence of events different from the official narrative. According to Zhang, Lin Biao had become extremely passive and inactive by 1971. When Lin Liguo informed Ye Qun that Mao was preparing to strip Ye of her Politburo seat, the two became convinced that their family would be purged if they failed to act, and developed a plan to escape.\n\nAt 10 o'clock the night before Lin's party fled, Ye Qun announced that the family would board a plane at 7 the next morning to fly to Guangzhou. Lin's 27-year-old daughter, Lin Liheng (known by the nickname \"Doudou\") opposed the escape plan, and contacted Lin's bodyguards to request that they guard her father from Ye. Doudou then phoned Zhou Enlai, but was not able to contact him directly, and Zhou only received Doudou's report second-hand.\n\nZhou received Doudou's message shortly after Doudou's phone call, directly from the general office of the Central Committee responsible for guarding China's senior leaders. The message contained Doudou's warning that Ye Qun and Lin Liguo were attempting to persuade Lin Biao to flee the country using an aircraft currently being prepared at Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport. Zhou called Wu Faxian, the commander of the air force, who verified the plane's existence. Zhou then issued orders that the plane could not take off without the written permission of himself and several other senior military officials, including Wu Faxian, general chief-of-staff Huang Yongsheng, and the commander of the navy and general chief-of-staff, Li Zuopeng. At 11:30, Ye Qun called Zhou and informed him that Lin Biao was planning to fly to Dalian, and denied that they had prepared a plane at Shanhaiguan. Zhou then told Ye to wait for him to travel to see Lin before they left Beidaihe (where they were staying), issued orders to neutralize potentially disruptive officers close to Lin (Wu Faxian and Huang Yongsheng), and ordered two planes readied in Beijing so that he could fly to Lin's residence to personally deal with the matter.\n\nYe made an announcement that the party were to pack quickly. Two hours after Doudou contacted Zhou, soldiers had still not responded in any meaningful way. Ye and Lin Liguo woke Lin Biao and packed him into a waiting limousine. The party then drove to Shanhaiguan airport, 25 miles away from their residence in Beidaihe, where their plane was waiting. Lin's bodyguards told Doudou and another companion that they were ordered to take them as well, but Doudou and her companion refused.\n\nOne soldier shot at Lin's limousine as it left Beidaihe, but missed, and most soldiers that the party encountered on their way to the airport allowed the limousine to pass. According to the driver of Lin's limousine, there was no time to place mobile stairs next to the plane's entrance, so the party boarded the plane via a rope ladder. Lin Biao was so weak that he had to be lifted and pulled onto the plane.\n\nZhang Ning observed the plane after it left the airport. Lin's plane initially traveled southeast (in the direction of Guangzhou). The plane then returned twenty minutes later and circled the airport several times as if it were trying to land, but the runway lights had been turned off. Soviet officials and Mongolian witnesses reported that the plane then flew north, over Mongolia and almost to the Soviet border, but then turned around and began flying south before it crashed. A Mongolian who witnessed the plane crash reported that the plane's tail was on fire when it crashed. The crash occurred at around 3:00 AM.\n\nNone of Zhou's instructions prevented Lin's flight, and he learned that Lin's plane had taken off before he, himself, could fly to see Lin. Zhou then ordered all planes nationwide grounded without the written permission of Mao, himself, and several senior military leaders. He rushed to Zhongnanhai to brief Mao of Lin's flight, and asked Mao if he wanted to order Lin's plane shot down, but Mao replied that they should \"let him go\". At 8:30 PM, September 13, the Mongolian Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador to make a formal complaint about the unauthorized entrance of a plane into Mongolian airspace, and reported to the ambassador that the plane had crashed, killing all on board. The Chinese ambassador to Mongolia then phoned Zhou Enlai, who then instructed the ambassador to tell the Mongolians that the plane had entered Mongolian airspace because it had gone off course.\nMongolian investigators were the first to inspect the wreckage, arriving later the same day. They found an identity card belonging to Lin Liguo, confirming Lin Liguo's presence on the flight. Markings on the plane and surviving miscellaneous personal items confirmed that the plane and passengers had originated from China, but the Mongolians were uncertain that any of the dead were either Lin Biao or Ye Qun. After inspecting the crash, the Mongolians buried the dead onsite.\n\nThrough the Chinese ambassador, Zhou requested and received permission for Chinese embassy staff to inspect the wreckage of Lin's plane, which they did on September 15–16. The staff reported to Zhou that the plane had caught fire while attempting to land, and then exploded. Zhou then sent additional staff to interview Mongolian witnesses of the crash, and to perform a detailed technical assessment of the crash. The report concluded that the plane had approximately 30 minutes of fuel when it crashed, but attempted to land without activating its landing gear or wing flaps.\n\nLater in 1971 a Soviet medical team secretly traveled to the crash site and exhumed the bodies, which were by then modestly decomposed. The team removed the heads of two of the corpses suspected to be Lin Biao and Ye Qun and took them back to Russia for forensic examination. In 1972 the team concluded that the heads belonged to Lin Biao and Ye Qun (the heads are still stored in Russian archives). In order to corroborate their findings the team returned to Mongolia a second time to inspect the body believed to be Lin Biao's. After exhuming the body a second time the team found that the corpse's right lung had the remains of tuberculosis, which Lin had suffered from, confirming the Soviet identification. The Soviet team were not able to determine the cause of the crash, but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude. Judging from the fires that burnt after the plane crashed, the Soviets estimated that it had enough fuel to fly to the Soviet cities of Irkutsk or Chita. All of the work and its results were kept secret from the public: outside of the investigative team, only KGB director Yuri Andropov and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev were informed. The report remained classified until the early 1990s, after the end of the Cold War.\n\nLin Biao was survived by Doudou and one other daughter. All military officials identified as being close to Lin or his family (most of China's high military command) were purged within weeks of Lin's disappearance. On September 14, Zhou announced to the Politburo that four of the highest-ranking military officials in China were immediately suspended from duty and ordered to submit self-criticisms admitting their associations with Lin. This announcement was quickly followed by the arrest of ninety-three people suspected of being close to Lin, and within a month of Lin's disappearance over 1,000 senior Chinese military officials were purged. The official purge of Lin's supporters continued until it was closed by the 10th Central Committee in August 1973. The incident marked the end of Mao's status as always absolutely correct within the Party. The National Day celebrations on October 1, 1971, were cancelled.\n\nThe news of Lin's death was announced to all Communist Party officials in mid-October 1971, and to the Chinese public in November. The news was publicly received with shock and confusion. Mao Zedong was especially disturbed by the incident: his health deteriorated, and he became depressed. At the end of 1971, he became seriously ill; he suffered a stroke in January 1972, received emergency medical treatment, and his health remained unstable. Mao became nostalgic about some of his revolutionary comrades whose purging Lin had supported, and backed Zhou's efforts to conduct a widespread rehabilitation of veteran revolutionaries, and to correct some of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution (which he blamed on Lin). In the aftermath of the purge of Lin's supporters, Zhou Enlai replaced Lin as the second most powerful man in China, and Jiang Qing and her followers were never able to displace him. Without the support of Lin, Jiang was unable to prevent Zhou's efforts to improve China's relationship with the United States, or to rehabilitate cadres who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution. The clause in the Party constitution indicating that Lin was Mao's successor was not officially amended until the 10th Central Committee in August 1973.\n\nThe position of the Chinese government on Lin and the circumstances of his death changed several times over the decade following 1971. For over a year, the Party first attempted to cover up the details of Lin's death. The government then began to issue partial details of the event, followed by an anti-Lin Biao propaganda campaign. After Mao's death, in 1976, the government confirmed its condemnation of Lin and generally ceased any dialogue concerning Lin's place in history. Throughout the 1970s, high-ranking leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including Hua Guofeng, spread the story to foreign delegates that Lin had conspired with the KGB to assassinate Mao.\n\nIn 1973 Jiang Qing, Mao's fourth wife and a former political ally of Lin's, started the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign, aimed at using Lin's scarred image to attack Zhou Enlai. Much of this propaganda campaign involved the creative falsification of history, including (false) details about how Lin had opposed Mao's leadership and tactics throughout his career. Lin's name became involved in Jiang's propaganda campaign after flashcards, made by Ye Qun to record Lin's thoughts, were discovered in Lin's residence following his death. Some of these flashcards recorded opinions critical of Mao. According to Lin's writings, Mao \"will fabricate 'your' opinion first, then he will change 'your' opinion – which is not actually yours, but his fabrication. I should be careful of this standard trick.\" Another critical comment of Lin's states that Mao \"worships himself and has a blind faith in himself. He worships himself to such an extent that all accomplishments are attributed to him, but all mistakes are made by others\". Lin's private criticisms of Mao were directly contradictory of the public image cultivated by Lin, who publicly stated following the Great Leap Forward that all mistakes of the past were the result of deviating from Mao's instructions.\n\nLike many major proponents of the Cultural Revolution, Lin's image was manipulated after Mao's death in 1976, and many negative aspects of the Cultural Revolution were blamed on Lin. After October 1976, those in power also blamed Mao's supporters, the so-called Gang of Four. In 1980, the Chinese government held a series of \"special trials\" to identify those most responsible for the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the government released their verdict: that Lin Biao must be held, along with Jiang Qing, as one of the two major \"counter-revolutionary cliques\" responsible for the excesses of the late 1960s. According to the official Party verdict, Lin and Jiang were singled out for blame because they led intra-Party cliques which took advantage of Mao's \"mistakes\" to advance their own political goals, engaging in \"criminal activity\" for their own self-benefit. Among the \"crimes\" he was charged with was the ouster of China's head of state, President Liu Shaoqi. Lin was found to be primarily responsible for using \"false evidence\" to orchestrate a \"political frame-up\" of Liu. Lin has been officially remembered as one of the greatest villains of modern China since then. Lin was never politically rehabilitated, so the charges against him continue to stand.\n\nFor several decades, Lin's name and image were censored within China, but in recent years a balanced image of Lin has reappeared in popular culture: surviving aides and family members have published memoirs about their experience with Lin; scholars have explored most surviving evidence relevant to his life and death, and have gained exposure within the official Chinese media; movies set before 1949 have made reference to Lin; and Lin's name has re-appeared in Chinese history textbooks, recognizing his contributions to the victory of the Red Army. Within modern China, Lin is regarded as one of the Red Army's best military strategists. In 2007, a portrait of Lin was added to the Chinese Military Museum in Beijing, included in a display of the \"Ten Marshals\", a group considered to be the founders of China's armed forces.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "892268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=892268", "title": "Lucy Larcom", "text": "Lucy Larcom\n\nLucy Larcom (March 5, 1824 – April 17, 1893) was an American teacher, poet, and author.\n\nIn the 1840s (circa 1846), Larcom taught at a school in Illinois before returning to Massachusetts. She went on to become one of the first teachers at Wheaton Female Seminary (now Wheaton College) in Norton, Massachusetts, and taught there from 1854 to 1862. While there, she helped to found \"Rushlight Literary Magazine\", a submission-based student literary magazine which is still published today. From 1865 to 1873, she was the editor of the Boston-based \"Our Young Folks\", which merged with \"St. Nicholas Magazine\" in 1874. In 1889, Larcom published one of the best-known accounts of New England childhood of her time, \"A New England Girlhood\", commonly used as a reference in studying antebellum American childhood. This autobiographical text covers the early years of her life, in Beverly Farms and Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nAmong her earlier and best-known poems are \"Hannah Binding Shoes,\" and \"The Rose Enthroned,\" Larcom's earliest contribution to the \"Atlantic Monthly\", when the poet Lowell was its editor, a poem, that in the absence of signature, was attributed to Emerson by one reviewer. Also of note was \"A Loyal Woman's No\" which was a patriotic lyric and attracted considerable attention during the American Civil War.\n\nLarcom was inclined to write on religious themes, and made two volumes of compilations from the world's great religious thinkers, \"Breathings of the Better Life\" (Boston, 1866) and \"Beckonings\" (Boston. 1886). Her last two books, \"As it is in Heaven\" (Boston, 1891) and \"The Unseen Friend\" (Boston, 1892), embodied much of her own thought on matters concerning the spiritual life.\n\nLucy Larcom was born in Beverly, Massachusetts in 1824 as the ninth of ten children. She was the next to the youngest of a family of eight sisters. The homes built up the streets of her village were full of neighbor children; they all played and grew up together. She read what she could find. This included the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" and the \"Scottish Chiefs\". She read John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and other English literature. At the age of seven, she secretly wrote, illustrated with crude watercolors, and published (only to herself) her first work: a manuscript volume of little stories and poems.\n\nAfter her father's death when she was eight years old, the home at Beverly was broken up. Mrs. Larcom turned her thoughts toward Lowell. Girls were wanted, and were flocking there for employment in the mills. Homes were wanted, also, in consequence. Good, motherly housekeepers —not common boarding-mistresses— were sought, and accepted only with the best credentials, by the corporation, to occupy its houses and take care of the operatives. Lucy's mother, the mother of many girls, was just one such. The family removed to Lowell, where her mother became a boardinghouse keeper to bring in income for the family. Here, at the age of ten, she helped her mother, in the intervals between her hours of school, in the household work.\n\nAt age eleven, in 1835, she began working at Boott Mills, a cotton mill in Lowell, as a doffer, to earn extra money for her family. She was among the very youngest of those employed at the mills. Her first work as a Lowell operative was in a spinning-room, doffing and replacing the bobbins, after which she tended a spinning-frame and then a dressing-frame, while looking out windows towards the river. Later, she was employed in a \"cloth-room,\" considered to be a more agreeable working-place because of its fewer hours of confinement, its cleanliness, and the absence of machinery. The last two years of her Lowell life, which covered in all a period of about ten years, were spent in that room, not in measuring cloth, but as bookkeeper, recording the number of pieces and bales. There, she pursued her studies during leisure moments, some textbooks in mathematics, grammar, English or German literature usually laying open on her desk.\n\nHere, as in her earlier childhood, she put words to her visions through verses and by telling herself stories. Of those days, Larcom stated,— \"While yet a child, I used to consider it special good fortune that my home was at Lowell. There was a frank friendliness and sincerity in the social atmosphere that wrought upon me unconsciously, and made the place pleasant to live in. People moved about their every-day duties with purpose and zest, and were genuinely interested in one another; while in the towns on the seaboard it sometimes was as if every man's house was his castle in almost a feudal sense, where the family shut themselves in, on the defensive against intruders.\" Still, she never lost her love and allegiance to the seaside area where she was born, while frequent visits kept up the charm, and gave her links to her home town.\nThe ten years that Larcom spent at the mills made a huge impact on her. The \"Lowell Offering\", a magazine whose editors and contributors were \"female operatives in the Lowell mills,\" was published in 1842, and soon after Larcom became one of its corps of writers. One of her first poems was entitled \"The River,\" and many of her verses and essays were found in its volumes. Some of those \"Lowell Offering\" essays appeared afterwards in \"Similitudes\", her first published work.\n\nIt was at one of the meetings of the literary circle, established among the \"mill girls\", that Larcom first met the poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, who was then in Lowell editing a Free Soil journal. He became her friend, showing his real interest in her at once by criticising her share in the written contributions of the evening. She was then very young, but it was the beginning of an interest and gratitude that continued mutually in an established friendship. Afterward, when she had come to know and dearly love the Whittier's sister, Elizabeth (\"Lizzie\"), the three spent time together. During happy sojourns at Salisbury Beach, near the respective homes at Amesbury and Beverly, in visits at Amesbury, in counsel and work together, out of which in recent time have grown the beautiful compilations of \"Child-life\", and \"Songs of Three Centuries\", their lives ran near together and contributed the one to the other.\n\nOne after another, Larcom's sisters married out of the home, until only two remained. At about twenty years of age, Larcom accompanied the oldest of the Larcom sisters in Lowell, Emeline, to the then wild prairies of Illinois. Here, she shared in the efforts of a clergyman's household in pioneer times. A truly pioneer life was theirs as they moved many times from place to place, dependent upon who summoned the clergyman. Somewhere in this prairie Larcom taught school in a vacated log building to a neighborhood. Her students came from small colonies within this radius. It was in the corner of a big township which included three counties. She taught under the auspices of a district committee, before whom, previous to induction to office, the candidate was obliged to hold up her right hand and swear to acquaintance, sufficient to instruct from, with writing, spelling, arithmetic, and geography. Her salary was for three months; and once, when the time for payment arrived, and her brother-in-law visited the committee-man whose duty it was to make it, his reminder was met with the rather startled remark, as if the subject had never presented itself in so strong a light before:— \"Forty dollars! Well, that's a lot o' money to pay a young woman for three months' teachin'! She oughter know consider'ble!\" When the official was reassured by a statement of what Larcom's antecedents in study and achievement had been, he replied:— \"Well, that's a good deal for her to ha' done!\" before handing over the money.\n\nDuring another sojourning, Larcom found herself in the neighborhood of an excellent young ladies' school. Switching from teacher of scholar, she spent three years at Monticello Female Semmary, following the full course of study. During the last two years, she took charge of the preparatory department of that institution.\n\nEventually, Larcom tired of life in the west, so she went back to Beverly, where, for a year or two, she taught a class of young ladies before accepting a position as teacher in Wheaton Female Seminary, at Norton. She remained there for six years, conducting classes in rhetoric, English literature, and composition, while sometimes adding history, mental and moral science, or botany. Larcom's health began after these few years to suffer from such a constant strain of teaching work forcing hhe had to relinquish the regular employment, although, from time to time, she lectures upon literature, or taught classes in various young ladies' schools of Boston. \n\nHer first poem in the \"Atlantic\" was \"The Rose Enthroned\" and it is remembered as her greatest inspiration. It was a parable-epic of creation with twenty-one four-line stanzas. Previously to this,— as far back as during her early residence in Illinois,— some poems were published with the name, and some slight sketch of the writer, in Griswold's \"Female Poets of America\"; and at about the same time, verses of hers were printed in \"Sartain's Magazine\". During 1852-53, she wrote frequently for the \"National Era\", of which Mr. Whittier was corresponding editor. Later, the \"Independent\" and the \"Boston Congregationalist\", and various other magazines received and published her contributions. \"Hannah Binding Shoes\" appeared first in the New York \"Crayon\"; perhaps no single poem of hers was better known or more admired. When \"Our Young Folks\" magazine was started, Larcom became one of its assistant editors. Subsequently, for a year or two, she was the leading editor. For the next seven years, she lived quietly and independently at Beverly Farms.\n\nIn the spirit of ministry, she gathered together the compilation of \"Breathings of a Better Life\". \"Roadside Poems\", and \"Hillside and Seaside\", were compilations from readings of nature. \"Childlife\", \"Childlife in Prose\", and \"Songs of Three Centuries\", were pulled together in company with Whittier, and which he edited. The volume, \"Wild Roses of Cape Ann\" came after these.\n\nLarcom served as a model for the change in women's roles in society. She was a friend of Harriet Hanson Robinson, who worked in the Lowell mills at the same time. Robinson also became a poet and author; later, she was prominent in the women's suffrage movement. Both contributed to the literary magazine \"Lowell Offering\".\n\nLarcom died at age 69 on April 17, 1893 in Boston and was buried in her hometown of Beverly, Massachusetts. Her influence is still felt in Beverly. A local literary magazine entitled \"The Larcom Review\" is named for her, as is the library at the Beverly High School.\n\nLarcom Mountain, located in the Ossipee Mountains in New Hampshire, is named after her, as she frequented the area during the late 1800s. At Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, the Larcom Dormitory is named after her. Rushlight Literary Magazine, which she founded, is still in publication today. Larcom's legacy is honored in Lowell, Massachusetts, where she worked as a \"mill girl\" at the Boott Mills, and as such, the Lucy Larcom Park was named after her to honor her works of literature that recounted her life at the mills. The park is located between the two Lowell High School buildings, and excerpts from her writings can be found on monuments, statues and other works of art throughout the park.\n\nLarcom's later writings, assumed a deeply religious tone, in which the faith of her whole life found complete expression. In retrospection, she wrote \"Idyl of Work\". Notwithstanding the fact that she really meant to set forth the image she had in her mind of her own elder sister, she unconsciously gave herself also, perhaps, through family likeness, in some touches of her portrayal of \"Esther\" in the \"Idyl\". In her \"Idyl of Work\" and also in \"A New England Girlhood\", Larcom described her early life. In the \"Idyl\", the mill-life of forty or fifty years earlier was portrayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The National Cancer Institute evaluated Gerson's claims and concluded that his data showed no benefit from his treatment. The therapy is both ineffective and dangerous.\n\nGerson was born in Wongrowitz, German Empire (Wągrowiec, now in Poland), on October 18, 1881. In 1909, he graduated from the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg. He began practicing medicine at age 28 in Breslau (Wrocław, now in Poland), later specializing in internal medicine and nerve diseases in Bielefeld.\nBy 1927, he was specializing in the treatment of tuberculosis, developing the Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet, claiming it was a major advance in the treatment of tuberculosis. Initially, he used his therapy as a supposed treatment for migraine headaches and tuberculosis. In 1928, he began to use it as a claimed treatment for cancer. He left Germany in 1933 and emigrated first to Vienna, where he worked in the West End Sanatorium. Gerson spent two years in Vienna, then in 1935 he went to France, associating with a clinic near Paris before moving to London in 1936. Shortly after that, he moved to the United States where he settled in New York City.\n\nGerson emigrated to the United States in 1936, passed his medical board examination, and became a U.S. citizen in 1942.\nThe rest of his family died at the hands of the Nazis. \nIn the U.S., Gerson applied his dietary therapy to several cancer patients, claiming good results, but other workers found his methodology and claims unconvincing. Proponents of the Gerson Therapy believe a conspiracy headed by the medical establishment prevented Gerson from publishing proof that his therapy worked. In 1958, Gerson published a book in which he claimed to have cured 50 terminal cancer patients: \"A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases\". In 1953, Gerson's malpractice insurance was discontinued and, in 1958, his medical license in New York was suspended for two years. Gerson died March 8, 1959 of pneumonia.\n\nInitially, Gerson used his therapy as a treatment for migraine headaches and tuberculosis. In 1928, he began to use it as a supposed treatment for cancer.\n\nGerson Therapy is based on the belief that disease is caused by the accumulation of unspecified toxins, and attempts to treat the disease by having patients consume a predominantly vegetarian diet including hourly glasses of organic juice and various dietary supplements. Animal proteins are excluded from the diet under the unproven premise that tumors develop as a result of pancreatic enzyme deficiency. In addition, patients receive enemas of coffee, castor oil and sometimes hydrogen peroxide or ozone.\n\nAfter Gerson's death, his daughter Charlotte Gerson continued to promote the therapy, founding the \"Gerson Institute\" in 1977. The original protocol also included raw calf's liver taken orally, but this practice was discontinued in the 1980s after ten patients were hospitalized (five of them comatose) from January 1979 to March 1981 in San Diego, California, area hospitals due to infection with the rare bacteria \"Campylobacter fetus.\" This infection was seen only in those following Gerson-type therapy with raw liver (no other cases of patients having sepsis with this microbe, a pathogen in cattle, had been reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the previous two years). Nine of ten hospitalized patients had been treated in Tijuana, Mexico; the tenth followed Gerson therapy at home. One of these patients who had metastatic melanoma died within a week of his septic episode. Many of the patients had low sodium levels, thought to be associated with the very low sodium Gerson diet. The photographer Garry Winogrand died of gallbladder cancer in a Gerson Clinic in Tijuana. \n\nGerson's therapy has not been independently tested or subjected to randomized controlled trials, and thus is illegal to market in the United States. The Gerson Institute promotes the therapy by citing patient testimonials and other anecdotal evidence. Gerson published a book discussing the alleged success of the therapy in 50 patients, but a review by the U.S. National Cancer Institute was unable to find any evidence that Gerson's claims were accurate. The NCI found that no \"in vivo\" animal studies had been conducted. Similarly, case series by Gerson Institute staff published in the alternative medical literature suffered from methodological flaws, and no independent entity has been able to reproduce the claims.\n\nAttempts to independently check the results of the therapy have been negative. A group of 13 patients sickened by elements of the Gerson Therapy were evaluated in hospitals in San Diego in the early 1980s; all 13 were found to still have active cancer. An investigation by Quackwatch found that the institute's claims of cure were based not on actual documentation of survival, but on \"a combination of the doctor's estimate that the departing patient has a 'reasonable chance of surviving', plus feelings that the Institute staff have about the status of people who call in\".\n\nA 1994 article in the \"Journal of Naturopathic Medicine\" attempted to follow 39 Gerson patients in Tijuana. Patient interviews were used to confirm the existence and stage of cancer; most patients were unaware of the stage of their tumor, and medical records were not available. Most patients were lost to follow-up; of the patients successfully followed, 10 died and six were alive at their last follow-up. Review of this study pointed out its \"obvious flaws\", including \"the majority of patients lost to follow-up, lack of access to detailed medical records, and reliance upon patients for disease stage information\"; the authors themselves regarded the results as unclear.\n\nThe American Cancer Society reported that \"[t]here is no reliable scientific evidence that Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer, and the principles behind it are not widely accepted by the medical community. It is not approved for use in the United States.\" In 1947, the National Cancer Institute reviewed 10 claimed cures submitted by Gerson; however, all of the patients were receiving standard anticancer treatment simultaneously, making it impossible to determine what effect, if any, was due to Gerson's therapy. A review of the Gerson Therapy by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center concluded: \"If proponents of such therapies wish them to be evaluated scientifically and considered valid adjuvant treatments, they must provide extensive records (more than simple survival rates) and conduct controlled, prospective studies as evidence\". In 1959, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) again reviewed cases of patients treated by Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit. Cancer Research UK states that \"Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that Gerson therapy can treat cancer [...] Gerson therapy can be very harmful to your health.\"\n\nGerson therapy can lead to several significant health problems. Serious illness and death have occurred as a direct result of some portions of the treatment, including severe electrolyte imbalances. Continued use of enemas may weaken the colon's normal function, causing or worsening constipation and colitis. Other complications have included dehydration, serious infections and severe bleeding.\n\nThe therapy may be especially hazardous to pregnant or breast-feeding women.\n\nCoffee enemas have contributed to the deaths of at least three people in the United States. Coffee enemas \"can cause colitis (inflammation of the bowel), fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and in some cases septicemia\". The recommended diet may not be nutritionally adequate. The diet has been blamed for the deaths of patients who substituted it for standard medical care.\n\nRelying on the therapy alone while avoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer has serious health consequences. Jessica Ainscough, better known as \"The Wellness Warrior\", was a major proponent of the Gerson diet after her diagnosis with cancer. She rejected medical treatment and followed the diet strictly, documenting her progress in a popular blog. She died from the cancer in February 2015, aged 30.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Yahyā. Hence, ibn Yahyā (which means son of Yahyā).\n\nA lady from Banu Asad bought Maytham (as a slave). Accordingly, Maytham worked for this lady until the caliphate of Imam Ali.\n\nThe first title/address was Mawali, meaning a slave of Persian origin living in Kufa. But after Maytham was freed from the shackles of slavery, he no longer was addressed as a Mawali. The second and most famous title given to Maytham was al-Tammar. Tammar stems from the Arabic word Tammer. In Arabic, Tammer means dates (a type of fruit). Therefore, al-Tammar means \"the date seller\". In Hebrew, Tamar means palm tree, date palm, or dates. Maytham received the title al-Tammar because he owned a market store in Kufa where he would sell dates and other types of fruit. In addition, al-Kufi was another title given to Maytham. Al-Kufi simply means a person from Kufa.\n\nAfter the time of Muhammad and the caliphate of Uthman, Imam Ali became Caliph in the year 656 AD. As the new caliph (after Uthman ibn Affan's death), Imam Ali moved the Islamic capital from Medina to Kufa for two reasons: to keep Mu'awiyah in check, and because Kufa had an illustrious history (many prophets of Allah lived in Kufa). Moving to Kufa, Imam Ali use to go around the city of Kufa. It is documented that if he encountered a slave he would try to free him or her. One day, Imam Ali saw a lady from the Banu Asad tribe, who had a male slave of Persian origin (Mawali). Imam Ali approached the woman and began to converse with her, in order to purchasing the slave, Salim. The two started to negotiate a price, and the lady's initial asking price was 50 dinar. As Imam Ali gave her the 50 dinar she changed the price to 100 dinar. She kept raising the price, since she realized that Imam Ali was willing to pay her a much higher price. Seeing the price soar, a companion of Imam Ali then asked, \"O Amir al-Momineen (Imam Ali), who is this man? What is he? He's originally a Persian, he is a slave, what the point of paying this much?\" Finally, she settled at 500 dinar. Imam Ali handed her the 500 dinar. She then called Salim and stated to him that Imam Ali has purchased you. After buying Salim, Imam Ali set him free from the shackles of slavery for the way of Allah. It demonstrated the Islamic view of slavery; Islam establishes that slavery is immoral and that all humans are equal in the perspective of Allah. The only thing that differentiates a human is their Taqwa. Islam called for a gradual emancipation of slaves. Meaning that masters/owners should not just set slaves free but they should help them build a foundation financially so that they (slaves) could support themselves. Thus, Imam Ali took Maytham under his wings after he freed Maytham. Moreover, a person who frees a slave is showered with blessing and would be protected from hell fire.\n\nAfter Imam Ali set him free, he greeted Salim by the name Maytham. Maytham was the name that his mother gave to him after his birth; no one in Kufa knew that Maytham was Salim's real name. Upon hearing a stranger calling him by Maytham, Salim was shocked, baffled, and astonished that a person other than his parents knew about his real name (Maytham). He questioned Imam Ali as to how did he knew that Maytham was his real name. Imam Ali replied, \"Come with me do not worry. Allah's Apostle (Prophet Muhammad) has told me that the Iranians call you Maytham. Still shocked, Maytham willing went with Imam Ali who would later become his best friend and teacher.\n\nSalim (a.k.a. Maytham) himself narrates this event:\n\nOther narrations state that Imam Ali tells Salim, \"Your name is Maytham, you are Iranian, you are of Iranian origin. Be proud of your Iranian origin.\"\n\nThe caliph, Imam Ali, would at times visit the market place of Kufa. In his visits he would stop by Maytham's store to converse with him. One day, Maytham was at his market store in Kufa selling dates. Imam Ali approached Maytham and said to him to take a prayer break. Other variants of this event state that Imam Ali told Maytham to take a break and visit his family. Another variant states that Maytham went to go buy something. Before leaving, Maytham requested Imam Ali to sell some dates. While Maytham was gone, Imam Ali looked over his shop. A shopper came looking to buy some dates. He looked around and them purchased four dates from Imam Ali. Some variants say he purchased four Dirhams worth of dates. But he purchased the dates using counterfeit money (fake money). Eventually, Maytham returned to his stall and asked Imam Ali if he managed to sell any dates. Imam Ali tells Maytham he sold some dates and handed Maytham the money. Maytham was shocked that Imam Ali sold the dates and did not realize that the money was fake. However, Imam Ali mentions to Maytham to remain patient because the shopper would come back for a reason. Maytham became confused, he had a feeling that the shopper would not come back because he essentially got free dates. A couple hours passed by, the man returned to Maytham's market shop upset at the taste of the dates that he recently purchased from the ruling caliph of the time, Imam Ali. The man requested for a return. Imam Ali then tells the man the dates were bitter because the money you gave was bitter (fake). The man was surprised and astonished. He then took his counterfeit money and left.\n\nMaytham himself narrates this event:\n\nMaytham comes back:\n\nThe man returns:\n\nMaytham viewed Imam Ali in a very positive light. He saw him as a humble and down to earth Caliph, who sought to teach his fellow citizens manners, religion, and a good lifestyle. Maytham himself says, \"Only Allah knows what lessons I learned from Ali ibn Abi Talib. I didn't find a human on this earth like Amir al-Momineen (Imam Ali). If you want to see the embodiment of humility, then see what I saw with Ali ibn Abi Talib. He also says, \"Ali ibn Abi Talib is the caliph of the state and I am a Tammar (date seller). Amir al-Momineen would come and sit by me. I would be there, I would sell dates. He would come and sit near me. Which king would sit next to a man selling dates. Whereas Ali ibn Abi Talib would come, sit near me. Look at the humility of the man (referring to Imam Ali).\" Furthermore, people who knew the caliph, Imam Ali, were astonished to find him at times sitting next to a Tammar (date seller) conversing.\n\nAs the cousin of Muhammad, Ali would follow his footsteps and educate people about the teachings of Islam. He taught/trained many religious scholars both Muslims and non-Muslims. Among these religious scholars was Maytham al-Tammar. Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib took Maytham under his wings, he taught Maytham many secrets about faith, religion, and the world. In addition, he taught Maytham many branches of knowledge, including \"ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya\" (esoteric knowledge of future events) and \"ilm-e-Taweel\" (interpretation and exegesis of the Quran). It is documented that Imam Ali would take Maytham to a nearby desert in the middle of the night to teach him about future affairs/matters/events. At times with the permission of his master/teacher, Maytham used to acquaint the public about the deep secrets that he learned from Imam Ali. On account of the frank speech of Maytham, people used to think that Maytham had lost his head/gone insane. They could hardly understand the depth and logic of his words.\n\nTeachings narrated my Maytham:\n\nAs a student of Imam Ali, Maytham was taught various categories of knowledge. One of these categories was ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya (the knowledge of death and future calamities). With ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya, Maytham prophesied specific events that would occur in the future. According to Kashshi and Liyakatali Takim, Maytham possessed supernatural knowledge unmatched by ordinary people. Kashshi also mentions that Maytham's ability to predict future events was a feat that was later matched by Muhammad ibn Sinan. \nMaytham became one of the top scholars of his time, in part of his desire to increase his understanding about various subjects and the teachings of Imam Ali. People would come to Maytham for explanations of Quranic verses, since he possessed ilm-e-Taweel (interpretation and exegesis of the Quran). Abdullah ibn Abbas is documented to be one of the people that would take lessons from Maytham.\n\nOnce Ali ibn Abi Talib, told Maytham that he would be hanged on account of the love for the Imam of his time. He also gave the address and told him that he would be hanged in a farm next to the house of Amr lbn Huraith. The tree on which he would be hanged was the smallest of the ten trees existing in the farm at that time. Maytham was also informed that his tongue would be cut out because he would not stop praising his Imam of time (Ali ibn Abi Talib). After getting this information, it is recorded in history that, Maytham used to go to the tree pointed out by Ali ibn Abi Talib, clean the place and water the tree and offer prayers saying, \"O tree! You are for me and I am for you. Months and years passed by, Ali was martyred then Hasan ibn Ali (the Second Shī`a Imām) was martyred and Maytham kept waiting for the time.\n\nIn 60 A.H., when Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad was appointed as the Governor of Kufa, things started to get complicated. Maytham then went to perform Hajj and thereafter returned to Kufa. One day, Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad, called him and asked him to come to his Court, and said, \"O Maytham! Inform me where your Allah is?\" Maytham immediately replied. \"He is in quest of an opportunity to punish the transgressors.\" Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad then asked him about his connections with Ali ibn Abi Talib. Maytham replied that Ali ibn Abi Talib was his master and that he loved him. Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad then asked him, \"Did your master tell you anything about your end?\" Maytham replied, \"Yes, he informed me that I would be hanged and that my tongue would be cut.\" Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad sent a roar of laughter and said, \"I will see that your master did not tell you the truth. I will see that his prophecy is belied.\" Maytham said, \"My master's words are true because he got that information from Allah. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad was informed by Jibril, and Jibril came with the message of Allah.\"\n\nUbayd-Allah ibn Ziyad ordered Maytham to be jailed and sent him to al-Tamura, a fearful prison underground, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi was in the same prison with Maytham. Maytham and Mukhtar would hold conversations in prison but later on the orders of Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad he was ordered to be hanged for creating mischief. Maytham was brought to the same tree to be hanged as pointed out by Ali ibn Abi Talib. Maytham began singing the praises of his master Ali, and about a thousand people gathered to see Maytham being hanged. Even after being hanged, the tongue of Maytham went on singing the praises of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad was informed about this and the tyrant ordered that the tongue of Maytham to be cut and thus the prophecy of Ali ibn Abi Talib came true and Maytham died after his tongue was cut out.\n\nThe book \"Nafasul Mahmoom\" states that \"Maytham was martyred ten days before Imam Husain (a.s.) came to Iraq.\" Imam Hussein entered Sharraf, on the border of Iraq and Hijaz on the 25th of Dhul Hijjah 60AH.\n\nIn 2006, a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle implosive explosive device near the shrine of Maytham al-Tammar in Kufa, Iraq. He detonated his vehicle bomb in between two vans carrying Iranian pilgrims. Twelve innocent civilians were killed and 37 more were injured as a result of the car bomb. Out of the 12 killed 8 were Iranians and out of the 37 that were injured 22 of them were Iranian.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41775439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41775439", "title": "Ni-Vanuatu name", "text": "Ni-Vanuatu name\n\nNi-Vanuatu names are the names used by the people of Vanuatu, who are commonly known as ni-Vanuatu. Under the law of Vanuatu, a child's name registered at birth should include \"the family name, the Christian name, if any, and the Melanesian individual name\", the latter of which is also known as a \"traditional name\" or \"custom name\". \n\nNaming customs differ between the various islands which comprise Vanuatu. The decision whether to give a child a custom name and/or \"foreign name\" may be tied to the parents' expectations of the child's future life path: whether he would remain in his village and inherit his ancestors' property and social roles, or whether he would leave to pursue a career elsewhere. Dickinson Tevi of the Mama Graon Project has expressed concerns that due to Western influence, the use of traditional names is dying out; he described traditional names as a vital link between children and their cultures and customs.\n\nTraditional names may be given at birth, or bestowed in adulthood by chiefs. Chiefs may also remove a traditional name so bestowed; in 2012, the chiefs of Tanna and then-President of Vanuatu Iolu Abil came to an agreement that Abil would no longer use the traditional name \"Kaniapnin\". Land tribunals may look at custom names as one factor in attempting to determine who has the right of usage of disputed custom land, as custom names are also sometimes tied to toponymy. For example, in central and southern Vanuatu, men's custom names make reference to the place where their clan's founding ancestors first appeared, known in Bislama as \"stamba\".\n"}
{"id": "766221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=766221", "title": "Paul Bearer", "text": "Paul Bearer\n\nWilliam Alvin Moody (April 10, 1954 – March 5, 2013), better known by his ring names Paul Bearer and Percival 'Percy' Pringle III, was an American professional wrestling manager. He was best known for his time in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE), where he performed as the manager of wrestlers such as The Undertaker, Kane, and Mick Foley.\n\nMoody was born in Mobile, Alabama on April 10, 1954. He attended San Antonio College and The University of South Alabama.\n\nHe entered the wrestling business in his teenage years as a ringside photographer. After high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, serving four years on duty; during this time, he often wrestled for Indian Coast independent promotions during off-duty hours. In 1979, he began managing as Percival \"Percy\" Pringle, III in southeastern independent promotions. There had been previous Percy Pringles in wrestling who were not William Moody. Immediately after his first son's birth, he cut back his involvement in the wrestling business in order to obtain a degree in mortuary science and earn certification as an embalmer and mortician.\n\nIn 1984, he resumed full-time involvement in the wrestling business, using his Pringle character in Championship Wrestling from Florida, World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas, and the United States Wrestling Association (a successor to WCCW). During this time, he served as manager for numerous wrestlers; he notably managed Rick Rude, \"Stunning\" Steve Austin, and Mark Calaway in their early careers. As Percy Pringle, he was also associated with the careers of Lex Luger, Eric Embry, and The Ultimate Warrior.\n\nHe joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in December 1990, after being mentioned by Rick Rude to WWF owner Vince McMahon. McMahon used Moody's real-life involvement in the funeral industry to create the character of Paul Bearer, a name given to him by Road Warrior Hawk and a play on the term pallbearer. In his portrayal of a very histrionic, ghostly manager, he was almost always seen bearing an urn (which led to several storylines involving wrestlers stealing his urn), and whose catch phrase was \"Ohhh yyes!\"\nMoody made his first appearance in February 1991, as a heel, when Brother Love, who originally managed The Undertaker, passed him on to be managed by Paul Bearer. Bearer took on a spookier, ghastlier character. Bearer also hosted the WWF talk show segment entitled \"The Funeral Parlor\", which included memorable segments such as the Ultimate Warrior being locked inside a casket, among others. In 1992, The Undertaker and Bearer turned face, when Undertaker stopped former ally Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts from ambushing Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage and Miss Elizabeth with a chair backstage.\n\nEventually Bearer turned heel again by betraying his long-time protege at SummerSlam 1996 to align himself with The Undertaker's arch-enemy, Mankind. During this time, Bearer also hired The Executioner and Vader to battle The Undertaker.\n\nIn April 1997 at , The Undertaker set Bearer's face ablaze using a fireball. As a result, Bearer's head was bandaged for a time before changing his looks, shedding the makeup of ghostly pallor and jet-black color to his natural strawberry blond hair and less make-up. No longer using his ghostly appearance and mannerisms, he became loudmouthed and shrill. Around mid-1997, Paul Bearer coerced Undertaker (WWF Champion at the time) into being his protégé again with the ultimatum of revealing a deep, dark secret from the past. During this time, Bearer made references to \"the fires of hell.\" Feeling he had no choice, The Undertaker accepted after several weeks of resistance. While \"managing\" Undertaker this time around, Bearer engaged in tyrannical behaviors towards him, harassing him constantly. Eventually, Undertaker lost his patience and refused to allow Bearer to continue being his manager, leading Bearer to reveal the secret.\n\nThe secret suggested that Bearer had a traumatic past with The Undertaker which long preceded Brother Love's joining the two in January 1991. The secret, which involved the Undertaker's family, was: The Undertaker's mother had an affair with Paul Bearer and as a result, gave birth to a younger half-brother of The Undertaker, named Kane. Throughout The Undertaker's childhood and teen years, he lived in a funeral home with his parents and half-brother. According to Paul Bearer, The Undertaker accidentally killed his parents by setting the funeral home ablaze and caused his half-brother's face to be bruised and scarred. At the time throughout mid to late 1997, The Undertaker denied all this, claiming it was his younger half-brother's fault. Bearer accused The Undertaker of being an \"arsonist\", \"murderer\", and \"liar.\"\n\nBecause of the fire incident, The Undertaker thought his younger half-brother and Bearer's illegitimate son had been dead for years. But Bearer introduced Kane in October 1997 at , where Kane cost The Undertaker a Hell in a Cell match against Shawn Michaels. This led to a bitter rivalry between The Undertaker and Kane and Bearer. Kane was not revealed as Bearer's son until April 27, 1998, on Monday Night Raw, a day after the first Inferno Match, at , where Kane was set on fire. The Undertaker was shown to have also been unaware of this at that time, and helped to build the feud up further, as Undertaker initially refused to believe the story until an in-story DNA test proved it to be true. The feud lasted into summer of 1998, when Kane seemingly abandoned Bearer to side with The Undertaker, beginning a face turn.\n\nBearer and The Undertaker became a heel team again toward the end of 1998 when Bearer betrayed his own son, Kane, in favor of managing The Undertaker once again. Once becoming a heel with Bearer, The Undertaker shamelessly admitted to setting the funeral home ablaze for which he had initially claimed was an accident or blamed Kane. Shortly thereafter, Bearer (returning to his signature look) and The Undertaker formed the Ministry of Darkness. Both he and The Undertaker took a hiatus from the WWF unceremoniously in September 1999 as a result of The Undertaker suffering an injury.\n\nIn early 2000, Bearer, who turned face once more briefly, returned to WWF TV as Kane's manager, but he retired from on-screen performing shortly after WrestleMania 2000. Later that year, he went backstage to serve as a WWF road agent, stage manager, and talent scout. His contract with WWE ended in October 2002.\n\nHe spent the next year working with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under the ring name Percy Pringle III.\n\nIn October 2003, he signed a new three-year contract with WWE. When Jim Ross contacted him about rejoining the company, Paul at first refused the offer. Ross then called again with an offer. At that time, he was suffering from health problems and depression related to his obesity and underwent gastric bypass surgery in November 2003. As a signing bonus, WWE agreed to pay for the surgery, as Ross promised.\n\nAfter recovering, he reappeared as Paul Bearer in March 2004 at WrestleMania XX, alongside Undertaker in a match against Kane. Paul Bearer also appeared on TV as The Undertaker's manager.\n\nIn spring of 2004, Paul Bearer was kidnapped by The Dudley Boyz under the direction of Paul Heyman. This was set up in order to temporarily write Bearer out of WWE story lines because he had to undergo emergency gallbladder surgery after suddenly developing gallstones, a common side effect of gastric bypass surgery.\n\nFor the June 27, 2004 pay-per-view The Great American Bash, a match pitting The Undertaker against both of The Dudley Boyz was booked. Paul Bearer was encased in a glass \"crypt\" backstage, covered up to his chest in cement. Heyman demanded The Undertaker throw the match or Bearer would be suffocated in cement.\n\nThe Undertaker won the match but proceeded afterwards to pull the lever that sent cement into the crypt, completely burying Paul Bearer, suffocating him. (Bearer was not really at the event. The WWE had recorded footage of Paul Bearer in the crypt before the event. During the event, there was a stunt double in the crypt the whole time. That's why the television audience could only see Paul Bearer and the crypt he was in – since he wasn't there, they couldn't actually show anyone on screen with Bearer). This shot ended the pay-per-view and caused numerous complaints toward WWE, as in essence they had shown a simulated murder. The live audience, however, saw an extended ending in which Bearer surfaced for air and was carried from the arena on a stretcher. On the following week's \"SmackDown!\", Bearer was acknowledged to be alive, although gravely injured, for storyline purposes. The rehearsal taping earlier in the day of the Bash – with Undertaker ad-libbing and only half of the stunt complete, in an empty arena – was leaked onto the internet dirt sheets and actually broadcast live by accident in many of the television markets. As he had two years remaining on his contract, however, Bearer was used as a booker for the company up until WWE decided to terminate his contract on April 11, 2005.\n\nOn June 10, 2005, Bearer announced that he had signed a new deal with WWE, allowing it to market his personality and requiring he attend autograph sessions, make promotional appearances and occasionally work TV and house shows. In late January 2007, at a SmackDown/ECW house show in Mobile, Alabama, Bearer joined The Brothers of Destruction at ringside, carrying the original urn.\n\nOn April 11, 2007, Bearer appeared in the \"Where Are They Now?\" page, on the WWE website. He was said to have lost 240 pounds.\n\nBearer was a manager in the THQ video game \"WWE Legends of WrestleMania\" in 2009. In 2010, Moody did voice over work as Paul Bearer for the game, \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011\", where he was featured in one of the \"Road To WrestleMania\" storylines for the game, as well as a selectable manager. He was also in \"WWE All Stars\", \"WWE '13\", and \"WWE 2K14\" as a selectable manager and part of the Attitude Era single-player mode, and 30 Years of WrestleMania mode respectively representing The Brothers of Destruction.\n\nBearer returned to the Boston-based Millennium Wrestling Federation as top heel manager along with John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield after four years, leading \"Stalker\" Dylan Kage at Soul Survivor VI against The Iron Sheik and \"Black Machismo\" Jay Lethal in the Sheik's retirement match April 24, 2010.\n\nOn October 12, 2012, Bearer managed Vader against Rikishi at Pro Wrestling Syndicate in Rahway, NJ.\n\nOn the September 24, 2010, episode of \"SmackDown\", Bearer made his first on-screen appearance in 6 years after being brought out in a casket. He helped The Undertaker, who was feuding with Kane over the World Heavyweight Championship, by restoring Undertaker's powers with the urn. Bearer officially became Undertaker's manager again by accompanying him to the ring for his match against Kane for the title at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view. During the match, Bearer once again turned on Undertaker, after shining a light in his eyes when he was about to Tombstone Kane. He then let Kane hit Undertaker with the urn to help him win. On the October 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bearer challenged Undertaker to face Kane in a Buried Alive Match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Bragging Rights, to which Undertaker accepted by attacking Kane. At Bragging Rights, Kane once again defeated Undertaker after interference by Bearer, who was almost thrown in the grave by Undertaker, and The Nexus, who helped Bearer and Kane bury Undertaker.\n\nKane then entered a feud with Edge, after he was named the new challenger to Kane's World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Kane cost Edge his match against Nexus member David Otunga. After the match, Edge kidnapped Bearer by strapping him in a wheelchair. Later that night, Edge used Bearer to cost Kane his match against Big Show. The following week, Edge tormented Bearer throughout the night by throwing a dodgeball at him and force feeding and throwing pizza all over him. Edge then used Bearer to call for Kane in the parking lot, but Kane wasn't able to get Bearer in time as Edge attacked him and drove off with Bearer. At Survivor Series, Edge brought an empty wheelchair causing Kane to go mad frantically trying to interrogate him on where Bearer was held. Even though the match ended in a draw, Kane was unable to find Bearer as Edge wheeled his enemy into a barricade. On the November 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", Kane demanded that Edge to let Bearer go, but Edge refused. Kane attempted to track down Bearer, but was unable to find him. Kane offered a second title shot to Edge, which he accepted, but continued to keep Bearer with him. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane to the parking lot, where Edge drove over a dummy version of Paul Bearer, with the actual Paul Bearer in the backseat of the car. On the December 3 episode of \"SmackDown\", Edge continued his mind games with Kane by pushing a dummy version of Paul Bearer down some stairs. Then, after Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match, he brought out a Paul Bearer lookalike. Kane then went to search for Bearer again, but Edge drove away in a truck with Bearer tied up on the back. The following week, Kane begged Edge to return Bearer, but Edge once again refused. Kane then refused to participate in the main event that night and once again searched for Bearer. After seeing what he thought was a dummy version of Paul Bearer on top of two ladders, Kane pushed them over. Afterward, Kane saw that he pushed the actual Paul Bearer off the ladders onto the concrete floor, thus, injuring him and writing him out of the storyline.\n\nIn April 2012, Bearer returned for a brief stint as a part of Kane's ongoing feud with Randy Orton. He was kidnapped by Orton and then stuck in a storage freezer while strapped to a wheelchair. Kane later came for Bearer, only to roll him back into the freezer and saying, \"I'm saving you... from me\".\n\nBearer was planned to reunite with The Undertaker and Kane on WWE Raw 1000 but could not make the event due to scheduling and travel conflicts. Bearer's last appearance for WWE was in April 2012 before his death.\n\nMoody married Dianna McDole in December 1978 and had two sons, Michael and Daniel. Daniel wrestles on the independent circuit as DJ Pringle. Dianna died due to complications resulting from breast cancer on January 31, 2009.\n\nMoody's health improved after his gastric bypass surgery. One year earlier, he admitted that he had weighed 525 pounds (238 kg) before the operation but dropped to under 300 pounds.\n\nIn September and October 2005, he conducted three shoot interviews for Ring of Honor. Two were done exclusively about him, talking about his career in wrestling. The third was with friend and fellow wrestling manager Jim Cornette. He returned full-time to his funeral business in 2006. In 2005, Moody, with three partners, started his own independent promotion known as Gulf South Wrestling. In May 2007 he dissolved the company after his partners wanted to continue the promotion without him. On September 21, 2014, his son Michael died.\n\nOn March 2, 2013, he attended the annual Gulf Coast Wrestlers Reunion in Mobile, AL. According to club board member \"Cowboy\" Bob Kelly, Moody was having breathing difficulties at the event. He was coughing, and told friends he was going to seek treatment for respiratory problems. Kelly said that Moody was treated for a blood clot after the reunion. On March 5, 2013, Moody died in Mobile, Alabama at the age of 58 due to a heart attack. The cause of the heart attack was supraventricular tachycardia, which causes a dangerously high heart rate.\n\nFollowing his death, Moody became a driving point in WWE storylines. The March 11 episode of \"Raw\" was held as a tribute to Bearer, The Undertaker paid tribute but was interrupted by CM Punk, his WrestleMania 29 opponent. Punk then mocked Bearer over the next few weeks against both The Undertaker and Kane, including stealing his urn and attacking Kane with it. On the April 1 episode of \"Raw\", Paul Heyman dressed up as Paul Bearer and Punk poured the ashes of the urn onto The Undertaker after attacking him. At WrestleMania 29, The Undertaker defeated Punk and took back the urn, dedicating his victory to Paul Bearer.\n\nOn the March 3, 2014, episode of \"Raw\" it was announced that Paul Bearer would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Kane was the inductor whereas his sons Michael and Daniel Moody had accepted the induction. After the segment, The Undertaker came out in character and paid tribute.\n\nOn February 24, 2016, his Hall of Fame ring was shown on \"Pawn Stars\"; the seller stated his ring was given to him by his family. Moody's son Daniel later stated that the ring was a fake.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "99502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99502", "title": "Reggie Mantle", "text": "Reggie Mantle\n\nReginald \"Reggie\" Mantle is a fictional teenager in stories published by Archie Comics. Created by writer-artist Bob Montana and John L. Goldwater in \"Jackpot Comics\" #5 (cover-dated Spring 1942) as well as CW's \"Riverdale\". He is a frenemy of Archie Andrews.\n\nReggie Mantle debuted in \"Jackpot Comics\" #5 (cover-dated Spring 1942). An enduring character, he appears across the Archie Comics line and headlined the series \"Archie's Rival Reggie\" (14 issues, 1949 n.d. – Aug. 1954), which returned a decade later as \"Reggie\" for the sporadically published issues #15-18 (Sept. 1963 – Nov. 1965). The series was renamed \"Reggie and Me\" for issues #19 – #126 (Aug. 1966 – Sept. 1980).\n\nOther series include \"Reggie's Wise Guy Jokes\" (55 issues, Aug. 1968 – Sept. 1980), and the three-issue miniseries \"Reggie's Revenge\" (Spring 1994 – Spring 1995).\n\nReggie appears as a main character in the 2015 \"Archie\" and \"Jughead\" titles that launched the New Riverdale reboot. On September 20, 2016, it was announced that a five-issue miniseries titled \"Reggie and Me\" would be published as part of the launch. It was written by Tom DeFalco with art by Sandy Jarrell.\n\nReggie Mantle at one point says he was born in Texas, and comes from a fairly well-to-do family, although certainly nowhere near the level of Veronica Lodge's. In Reggie's debut story, Archie refers to him as, 'that snooty Reggie Mantle', indicating his upper-class background. His father, Ricky Mantle, owns a newspaper-publishing company, one of his publications is \"The Riverdale Gazette\". Reggie seems to show journalistic aspirations himself, often working as the editor of the high school paper, Blue and Gold. He is quick to use the term \"freedom of the press\" to defend controversial or inflammatory articles. Little is known of his mother, though her name was eventually revealed to be Vicky Mantle. Reggie has a brother, Oliver Mantle, who has appeared in \"Life With Archie\" issue #26. Compared to the families of the other main characters, Reggie's family members have made very few appearances in the comics through the decades.\n\nLike many Archie characters, Reggie has a number of relatives who are created for one story only. One, his cousin May, is often mistaken for a pre-teen. After a makeover, she attracts attention at a school dance, but choses to dance with short Dilton. Another cousin, Regina, has Reggie's style of humor, but after a date with Jughead, appears to enjoy herself. Reggie also has a number of relatives whom he often uses to get favors.\n\nReggie has been known to boast that his family is the only one in Riverdale that has its own coat of arms.\n\nReggie Mantle's chief characteristics are his love of sarcasm and practical jokes, his vanity, his athletic abilities, and his interest in dating multiple women.\n\nReggie is a naturally gifted and talented athlete who excels at nearly every major sport, including football, baseball, and basketball, along with more obscure sports such as cross country running and Kung Fu. He often works as a surfing or skiing instructor. Sometimes, if his skills are not enough to secure victory, Reggie cheats, and he often shows little team spirit. Once in a while, Reggie tries to win competitions on a technicality by pulling out a rulebook.\n\nThe most common accessories associated with Reggie are the mirror and the comb. A lot of jokes in the comics are about his vanity, earning him the nickname \"Reggie 'I-Love-Me' Mantle\". Somewhat of a fashion plate, Reggie is the character who most frequently experiments with his hairstyle to match current trends. These looks have lasted months (rather than been contained within a single story) and have included several incarnations of sideburns, slicked back, short, shaggy, and even a ponytail in the early 1990s.\n\nReggie, along with Archie and Jughead, is one of the founding members of the band \"The Archies\". Reggie is a bassist for The Archies and occasionally lead guitarist after Archie, and thinks of himself as the most important and talented member of the group—and has gone to great lengths to prove it, such as hiring groupies to scream his name during concerts. Although his instrument of choice is guitar, Reggie has also demonstrated skill in singing, acting, and piano-playing.\n\nHis sharp, quick wit has led him to working part-time as a stand-up comedian at a Riverdale comedy club, and hoping to perform professionally someday. In spite of his evident upper-middle class status, he is remarkably cheap, and the first time his schoolmates remember him inviting them to a party, he had filled the room with vending machines from which to obtain the party food.\n\nReggie is Riverdale High's resident prankster. It is not unusual for Reggie's practical jokes to backfire. His pranks are usually meant to embarrass his victims rather than physically hurt them. When he tries to humiliate Chuck Clayton during a sledding contest, Reggie digs a pit for Chuck to fall into when he landed. Reggie fills the pit with sawdust to soften the blow, adding crankcase oil to make it stick and covering it with snow to conceal it.\n\nReggie likes to chase girls, delighting in the pursuit, but is not usually interested in having a serious relationship with one girl. Reggie likes to play the field, and openly announces himself 'a true practitioner of the art'. He has expressed horror at the idea of being tied down to one solitary female, saying that, \"having one girl is like having one peanut, one potato chip.\"\n\nReggie is Archie Andrews's rival, and has a perennial crush on Veronica Lodge. The fact that she loves Archie makes Reggie jealous, so he spends most of his time trying to outwit Archie, and playing practical jokes on him. Despite the rivalry, he and Archie are generally amicable, and often spend time together pursuing dates or practicing athletics. In \"Archie's Double Digest\" #201, during the possibility of Archie moving, he eventually admits he would miss Archie, whom he calls his best friend. In a lot of the older Archie Comics stories, Reggie and Archie team up to play pranks on Jughead Jones. Their schemes usually backfire as Jughead outwits them.\n\nOther than Veronica, Reggie is romantically interested in Midge Klump, who is the girlfriend of one of Reggie's athletic teammates, Moose Mason. Reggie's relentless efforts to spend time with Midge without attracting Moose's ire are a running gag. He occasionally seeks to date other women, including Betty Cooper. Reggie and Betty frequently join forces to try and break up Archie and Veronica. In some stories, Reggie and Betty are shown to be a couple, even though their respective interests still lie with Veronica and Archie. The \"Life with Archie\" series looks to a future where Archie marries Veronica and Betty and Reggie are a loving couple. It has been hinted that they are thinking about getting married.\n\nIn the rare occasions when Reggie is genuinely trying to help someone, the others usually believe he has nefarious motives, and are wary of trusting him.\n\nReggie is insanely jealous of anyone else but him being in the spotlight, and will sometimes deliberately cause them trouble to get what he wants.\n\nReggie is also known to date Cheryl Blossom occasionally. The two have very similar personalities, and at one point, before she dates a boy named George, try going out together. Like Betty and Veronica, however, Cheryl mainly uses Reggie as an alternative to Archie.\n\nOn certain occasions, Reggie shows a kinder side where he will come to the aid of his friends or total strangers, although he prefers to keep these good deeds secret. In one comic, he has a close childhood friendship with an elderly woman named Mrs. Finklehoff.\n\nIn one storyline, Reggie is shown to have fallen in love with Veronica's cousin, Harper. They have a long distance relationship, so there aren't many times they are shown together. Harper is a disabled author, blogger, and fashion designer with an automated, bedazzled, bright pink wheelchair.\n\nIn \"Afterlife with Archie\", Reggie Mantle caused the zombie apocalypse. Midge asks him for money so she can pay for an abortion. This frustrates and angers him to the point that when he sees Hot Dog on the side of the road he swerves to hit him. He immediately regrets his actions and tries to carry Hot Dog to a vet, failing that, he takes him to Jughead's lawn so that he can die at home. Hot Dog's subsequent reanimation results in him infecting Jughead and starting the zombie apocalypse. \n\nReggie survives with the others on the road, growing increasingly bitter towards Archie for becoming a natural leader and thriving while he is continually wracked with guilt for starting all this horror. Archie remains oblivious to this, intending to make Reggie the best man at his wedding to Betty. Reggie eventually goes out hunting with Kevin and tells him how he caused the apocalypse, how he killed Hot Dog, how he fears he might be a sociopath and how he thinks the only way to end the zombie plague is by offering himself up to the horde so they can have their revenge and hopefully stop their rampage. He wanders off alone into the woods. Kevin tells the others his story, Archie wants to go after him but Veronica and Betty convince him otherwise.\n\nReggie walks into the horde, expecting to be torn limb from limb, but instead they part for him until he reaches the zombified Jughead. The zombified Hot Dog walks forward, and Reggie kneels before it, expecting it to kill him and accepting his fate. But, at that moment a vision of Sabrina Spellman appears before him. She tells him that they will make the zombified Midge whole once again and make her do whatever Reggie wants if Reggie returns to his friend and kills Betty Cooper. Reggie's resolve to redeem himself crumbles upon being offered Midge and he responds with \"Kill Betty Cooper... sure, why not?\"\n\n\n"}

Created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, the character first appeared in \"World's Finest Comics\" #3 (September, 1941). The self-proclaimed \"Master of Fear\" is commonly depicted as an obsessive ex-professor of psychology in Gotham City who uses a variety of experimental drugs and toxins to exploit the fears and phobias of his victims. He is one of the most enduring enemies of the superhero Batman and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up the Dark Knight's rogues gallery.\n\nIn 2009, the character was ranked as IGN's 58th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. The Scarecrow has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, such as feature films, television series, and video games. He has been voiced by Henry Polic II and Jeffrey Combs in the DC Animated Universe, by Dino Andrade and John Noble in the , and by Robert Englund in \"Injustice 2\". He has been portrayed in live-action by Cillian Murphy in \"The Dark Knight\" Trilogy, and by Charlie Tahan and David W. Thompson in the FOX television show \"Gotham\".\n\nBill Finger, Bob Kane and Jerry Robinson introduced Scarecrow in the fall of 1941 for \"World's Finest Comics\" #3, during the Golden Age of Comic Books, in which he only made two appearances. The character was revived during the Silver Age of Comic Books by writer Gardner Fox and artist Sheldon Moldoff in the pages of \"Batman\" #189 (February 1967), still maintaining his origin story from the Golden Age. It was also in \"Batman\" #189 that the Scarecrow's fear gas debuted.\n\nFollowing the 1986 multi-title event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" reboot, the character's origin story is expanded in \"Batman Annual\" #19 and the miniseries \"Batman/Scarecrow: Year One\", with this narrative also revealing that Crane has a fear of bats.<ref name=\"B/S:YO\">\"Batman/Scarecrow: Year One\"</ref> In 2011, as a result of The New 52 reboot, Scarecrow's origin (as well as that of various other DC characters) is completely altered, incorporating several elements that differ from its original.\n\nDuring his childhood and adolescence, Jonathan Crane was obsessed with fear and revenge as a result of having been constantly bullied, especially because of his resemblance to Ichabod Crane from \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\". After being humiliated by his school bully Bo Griggs and rejected by cheerleader Sherry Squires, he takes revenge during the senior prom by donning his trademark scarecrow costume and brandishing a gun in the school parking lot; in the ensuing chaos, Griggs gets into a car accident, paralyzing himself and killing Squires.\n\nCrane's obsession with fear leads to his becoming a psychologist, taking a position at Arkham Asylum and performing fear-inducing experiments on his patients. He is also a professor of psychology at Gotham University, specializing in the study of phobias. He loses his job after he fires a gun inside a packed classroom, accidentally wounding a student; he takes revenge by killing the professors responsible for his termination, and becoming a career criminal. As a college professor, Crane mentored a young Thomas Elliot. The character also has a cameo in \"Sandman\" #5, seeming uncharacteristically friendly.\n\nIn stories by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale, the Scarecrow is depicted as one of the more deranged criminals in Batman's rogues gallery, with a habit of speaking in nursery rhymes. These stories further revise his backstory, explaining that he was raised by his fanatically religious grandmother, whom he murdered as a teenager.\n\nScarecrow plays a prominent role in Doug Moench's \"Terror\" storyline, set in Batman's early years, where Scarecrow is broken out of prison by the mysteriously returned Professor Hugo Strange, who selects Scarecrow as an ally to help him capture Batman. Scarecrow turns on Strange when Strange's therapy proves effective enough to turn the Scarecrow against his 'benefactor', impaling him on a weather vane and throwing him in the cellar of his own mansion. The Scarecrow then uses Strange's mansion as a trap for Batman, but it is less effective than Strange's plan of attack due to Scarecrow lacking knowledge of Batman's identity; Scarecrow uses Strange's plan to lure Batman to Crime Alley, but his 'trap' consists of simply decapitating one of his former classmates in the alley in front of Batman. With the help of Catwoman—whom Scarecrow had attempted to blackmail into helping him by capturing her and photographing her unmasked face—Batman catches Scarecrow, but loses sight of Strange, with it being unclear whether Strange had actually survived the fall onto the weather vane—he claimed that he lured rats to himself by using his sweat so that he could eat them—or if Scarecrow and Batman were hallucinating from exposure to Scarecrow's fear toxin, although Batman concludes that the subsequent explosion of the house has definitely killed Strange.\n\nScarecrow appears in \"\", first seen escaping from Arkham on Mother's Day with help from Carmine Falcone, who also helps the Mad Hatter to breakout. The Scarecrow gases Batman with fear toxin as he escapes, causing Batman to flee to his parents' grave as Bruce Wayne, where he is arrested by Commissioner Jim Gordon due to Wayne's suspected ties to Falcone. Scarecrow robs a bank with the Mad Hatter on Independence Day for Falcone, but is stopped by Batman and Catwoman. He later appears in Falcone's office on Halloween with Batman's future rogue's gallery, but is defeated by Batman. Scarecrow returns in \"\" as part of Two-Face's gang, and is first seen putting fear gas in children's dolls on Christmas Eve. He is eventually defeated by Batman. He later appears as one of the villains present at Calendar Man's trial. It is revealed he and Calendar Man had been manipulating Falcone's son Alberto; Scarecrow had determined that Alberto feared his father, and poisoned his cigarettes with fear toxin to bring out the fear; Calendar Man, meanwhile, had been talking to Alberto, with the fear toxin making Alberto hear his father's voice. Together, they manipulate Alberto into making an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his sister, Sofia Gigante. After Two-Face's hideout is attacked, Batman captures Scarecrow, who tells him where Two-Face is heading. In \"\", Scarecrow supplies the Riddler with fear gas to manipulate Catwoman, and later aids Riddler when he fights Catwoman in Rome. Scarecrow accidentally attacks Cheetah with his scythe before Catwoman knocks him out.\n\nThe Scarecrow appears in such story arcs as \"\" and \"\", first teaming with the Joker to ransom off the mayor of Gotham City. Batman foils their plan, and forces them to retreat. Scarecrow betrays Joker by spraying him with fear gas, but it has absolutely no effect; Joker then beats Scarecrow senseless with a chair. Scarecrow later tries to take over Gotham with an army of hypnotized college students, commanding them to spread his fear gas all over the city. His lieutenant is the son of the first man he killed. He is confronted by both Batman-Azrael and Anarky, and tries to escape by forcing his lieutenant to jump off of a building. Batman-Azrael knocks him out, and Anarky manages to save the boy.\n\nDespite his criminal history, he is still recognized as a skilled psychologist. When Aquaman needed insight into a serial killer operating in his new city of Sub Diego - San Diego having been sunk and the inhabitants turned into water-breathers by a secret organization - he consulted Crane for insight into the pattern of the killer's crimes, Crane determining that the victims had been chosen as the initials of their first and last names spelled out the message 'I can't take it any more' (thus allowing Aquaman to determine both the true identity and final target of the real killer).\nIn the 2004 story arc \"As the Crow Flies\", Scarecrow is hired by the Penguin under false pretenses. Dr. Linda Friitawa then secretly mutates Scarecrow into a murderous creature known as the \"Scarebeast\", who Penguin uses to kill off his disloyal minions. The character's later appearances all show him as an unmutated Crane again, except for an appearance during the \"\" story arc. Scarecrow appears in the third issue of \"War Games\" saving Black Mask from Batman and acting as the crime lord's ally, until Black Mask uses him to disable a security measure in the Clock Tower by literally throwing Scarecrow at it. Scarecrow wakes up, transforms into Scarebeast, and wreaks havoc outside the building trying to find and kill Black Mask. The police are unable to take it down, and allow Catwoman, Robin, Tarantula II, and Onyx to fight Scarebeast, as Commissioner Atkins had told all officers to capture or kill any vigilantes, costumed criminals or \"masks\" they find. Even they cannot defeat the Scarebeast, though he appears to have been defeated after the Clock Tower explodes.\n\nThe Scarecrow reappears alongside other Batman villains in \"Gotham Underground\"; first among the villains meeting at the Iceberg Lounge to be captured by the Suicide Squad. Scarecrow escapes by gassing Bronze Tiger with fear toxin. He later appears warning the Ventriloquist II, Firefly, Killer Moth and Lock-Up, who are planning to attack the Penguin that Penguin is allied with the Suicide Squad. The villains wave off his warnings and mock him. He later leads the same four into a trap orchestrated by Tobias Whale. Killer Moth, Firefly and Lock-Up all survive, but are injured and unconscious to varied degrees, the Scarface puppet is \"killed\", and Peyton Reily, the new Ventriloquist, is unharmed, though after the attack she is taken away by Tobias Whale's men. Whale then betrays Scarecrow simply for touching his shoulder (it is revealed Whale almost pathologically hates \"masks\" because his grandfather was one of the first citizens of Gotham killed by a masked criminal). The story arc ends with Scarecrow beaten and tied up by Tobias Whale, as a sign to all \"masks\" that they are not welcome in Whale's new vision of Gotham.\n\nScarecrow appears in \"\", working for the Riddler and Hush. He composes profiles on the various villains of Gotham so Riddler and Hush can manipulate them to their own ends. He later gases Huntress with his fear gas, making her attack Catwoman. He attacks Batman in a graveyard, only to learn his fear gas is ineffective (due to Hush's bug), but before he can reveal this he is knocked out by Jason Todd. Scarecrow also appears in \"\", kidnapping a child to distract Batman so Hush can attack Catwoman. When Batman goes to rescue the child, Scarecrow activates a Venom implant, causing the boy to attack Batman. He is defeated when Batman ties the boy's teddy bear to Scarecrow, causing the child to attack Scarecrow. After he is captured, Batman attacks him in prison to get Hush's location.\n\nIn the \"\" storyline, Scarecrow is recruited by a new Black Mask to be a part of a group of villains who are aiming to take over Gotham in the wake of Batman's apparent death. He later assists the crime lord in manufacturing a recreational drug called \"Thrill,\" which draws the attention of Oracle and Batgirl. He is later defeated by Batgirl and once again arrested.\n\nScarecrow briefly appears in the fourth issue of the \"Blackest Night\" storyline. His immunity to fear (brought about by frequent exposure to his own fear toxin) renders him practically invisible to the invading Black Lanterns. The drug has taken a further toll on his sanity, exacerbated by the long disappearance of Batman in the \"Batman R.I.P.\" storyline; he develops a literal addiction to fear, exposing himself deliberately to the revenant army, but knowing that only Batman could scare him again. Using a duplicate of Sinestro's power ring, he is deputized into the Sinestro Corps for 24 hours in order to combat the Black Lanterns. Overjoyed at finally being able to feel fear again, Scarecrow gleefully and without question follows Sinestro's commands. His joy is cut short when Lex Luthor, overwhelmed by the orange light of Avarice, steals his ring.\n\nDuring the events of \"Brightest Day\", Scarecrow begins kidnapping and murdering college interns working for LexCorp as a way of getting back at Lex Luthor for stealing his ring. When Robin and Supergirl attempt to stop his plans, Scarecrow unleashes a new fear toxin that is powerful enough to affect a Kryptonian. The toxin forces Supergirl to see visions of a Black Lantern Reactron, but she is able to snap out of the illusion and help Robin defeat Scarecrow. He is eventually freed from Arkham when Deathstroke and the break into the asylum in order to capture one of the inmates.\n\nIn The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Scarecrow is a central villain in the Batman family of books and first appeared in the New 52 in \"\" #4 (February 2012), written by David Finch and Paul Jenkins. His origin story is also altered; in this continuity, his father used him as a test subject in his fear-based experiments. As part of the experiments, Jonathan was locked inside a little dark room, while his father (who was examining the test's effects from the outside) suffered a heart attack and died, leaving Jonathan trapped in the test chamber for days until being freed by some employers of the University. As a result of this event, he was traumatized for most of his childhood, and eventually developed an obsession with fear. He became a psychologist, specializing in phobias. Eventually, Crane began using patients as test subjects for his fear toxin. His turn to criminality is also markedly different, as he was fired from his professorship for covering an arachnophobic student with spiders, and became a criminal after stabbing a patient to death.\n\nThe Scarecrow had kidnapped Poison Ivy, and works with Bane to create and distribute to various Arkham inmates, a new form of Venom infused with the Scarecrow's fear toxin. With the help of Superman and The Flash, Batman defeats the villains. The Scarecrow surfaces again in \"Batman: The Dark Knight\" #10, penned by Gregg Hurwitz, for a six-issue arc. The Scarecrow kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and several children, and eventually releases his fear toxin into the atmosphere. Scarecrow is also used as a pawn by the Joker, for his \"Death of the Family\" plot; he is referred to as Batman's Physician.\n\nScarecrow appears in \"Swamp Thing\" #19 (June 2013), clipping flowers for his toxins at the Metropolis Botanical Garden. Swamp Thing attempts to save Scarecrow from cutting a poisonous flower, not realizing who the villain is. Scarecrow attempts to use his fear toxin on Swamp Thing. The toxin causes Swamp Thing to lose control of his powers, until Superman intervenes.\n\nHe is later approached by the Outsider of the Secret Society of Super Villains to join up with the group. Scarecrow accepts the offer.\n\nAs part of \"Villains Month\", \"Detective Comics\" vol. 2, #23.3 (Sept. 2013) was titled \"The Scarecrow\" #1. Scarecrow goes to see Killer Croc, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Riddler and informs them of a war at Blackgate Penitentiary is coming and learns where each of the alliances live. Through his conversations with each, Scarecrow learns that Bane may be the cause of the Blackgate uprising and will be their leader in the impending war. It was also stated that that Talons from the Court of Owls were stored at Blackgate on ice. Later, looking over the divided city, Scarecrow claims that once the war is over and the last obstacle has fallen, Gotham City would be his. Scarecrow approaches Professor Pyg at Gotham Memorial Hospital to see if he will give his supplies and Dollotrons to Scarecrow's followers. Scarecrow goes to Penguin next, who has already planned for the impending war, by blowing up the bridges giving access to Gotham City. Scarecrow and Man-Bat attempt to steal the frozen Talons from Blackgate while Penguin is having a meeting with Bane. Killer Croc rescues Scarecrow and Man-Bat from Blackgate and brings Scarecrow to Wayne Tower, where he gives Killer Croc Wayne Tower as it no longer suits him. Scarecrow begins waking the Talons in his possession, having doused them with his fear gas and using Mad Hatter's mind-control technology in their helmets to control them. At Arkham Asylum, Scarecrow senses that he has lost the Talons after Bane freed them from Mad Hatter's mind-control technology. Scarecrow then turns to his next plan, giving the other inmates a small dose of Bane's Venom to temporarily transform them. Upon Bane declaring that Gotham City is finally his, he has Scarecrow hanged between two buildings.\n\nIn \"Batman and Robin Eternal\", flashbacks reveal that Scarecrow was the first villain faced by Dick Grayson as Robin in the New 52 universe, when his and Batman's investigations into Scarecrow's activities led Batman to Mother, a woman who believes that tragedy and trauma serve as 'positive' influences to help the victims become stronger. To this end, Mother has Scarecrow develop a new style of fear toxin that would make the brain suffer the same experience as witnessing a massive trauma, but Scarecrow turns against Mother as the victims of this plan would become incapable of feeling anything. Recognizing that he will be killed once he has outlived his usefulness, Scarecrow attempts to turn himself over to Batman, but Batman uses this opportunity to have Crane deliver a fake psychological profile of him to Mother, claiming that Batman is a scared child terrified of fear and losing others to make Mother think she understands him. In the present day, as Mother unleashes a new hypnotic signal to take control of the world's children, the Bat Family abduct Scarecrow to brew up a new batch of his trauma toxin after determining that it nullifies the controlling influence of Mother's signal until they can shut down her main base.\n\nIn the DC Rebirth rebooted universe, Scarecrow has a cameo appearance as one of the many trials that Batman's apprentice Duke Thomas has faced in his training. He later works with The Haunter to release a low dose of fear gas around Gotham on Christmas, and sets up a small stand for her to pickup the fear gas. Both he and Haunter are paralyzed by the effects of the fear gas and arrested by Batman. The Scarecrow later emerges using a Sinestro Corps' Power ring to induce fear and rage against Batman in random citizens throughout Gotham, to the point where he provokes Alfred Pennyworth into threatening to shoot Simon Baz as part of his final assault.\n\nIn the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock\", Scarecrow is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory.\n\nJonathan Crane is a brilliant psychologist who specializes in fear and phobias. With this knowledge, he knows how to use words to affect a person's actions.\n\nIn the story arc \"As the Crow Flies\", after been secretly mutated by Dr. Linda Friitawa, Scarecrow gains the ability to turn into a large monster with greatly enhanced strength, endurance, and a fear gas he naturally emits. However, he has to be under physical strain or duress to transform.\n\nHe is also an accomplished biochemist for his invention of fear gas that causes his victims to experience nightmarish hallucinations. He wears his Scarecrow mask to enhance the effect of the hallucinogen. The mask contains filters to protect him from his own gas. Prolonged exposure to his own gas has damaged Crane's brain despite measures that have been made to protect himself from it, rendering him nearly incapable of being afraid of anything, except Batman. This is problematic for him, as he is addicted to fear and compulsively seeks out confrontations with Batman to feed his addiction.\n\nThe Scarecrow at times wields a scythe which he uses in addition to his \"violent dancing\". Scarecrow also uses a hand-held fear gas sprayer in the shape of a human skull, straws which he leaves as a calling card, special straws which can be snapped in half to release a fear poison (as seen in \"Batman: Hush\") and stuffed scarecrows which scare his victims.\n\nDuring the \"Blackest Night\" mini-series, Scarecrow is temporarily deputized into the Sinestro Corps by a duplicate of Sinestro's Power ring. He proves to be very capable in manipulating the light of fear to create constructs, until his ring is stolen by Lex Luthor.\n\nAs one of Batman's most recognizable and popular opponents, the Scarecrow appears in numerous comics which are not considered part of the regular DC continuity, including:\n\nThe Scarecrow appears in \"\", in which he attempts to use the Kingpin's crime empire to disperse his fear gas over Gotham City. He is defeated when Daredevil, the \"Man Without Fear\", proves immune to the gas.\n\nIn \"DC vs. Marvel\", the Scarecrow temporarily allies with the Marvel Universe Scarecrow to capture Lois Lane before they are both easily defeated by Ben Reilly.\n\nThe Scarecrow is featured in part two of the four-part in \"\". This version of Scarecrow is portrayed as a German agent who kills a contact working for the Bat (Batman), the Clock (Hourman), and the Owl (Doctor Mid-Nite). In a struggle with Scarecrow, the fiancée of agent Terry Sloane is killed. This causes Sloane to return to the field as Mister Terrific and kill Scarecrow.\n\nA stand-in for Jonathan Crane named Jenna Clarke/Scarecrone appears in the \"Elseworlds\" original graphic novel \"\" as a henchwoman/consort under the employ of Vandal Savage. Scarecrone also acts as a stand-in for Two-Face. She has the power to invade a person's psyche and make their deepest fears appear as illusions simply by touching them. \"Scarecrone\" is actually a separate personality from Jenna Clarke, Vandal Savage requires Clarke to switch to her Scarecrone persona through a special formula that he has made Clarke dependent on. The two personalities are actually extremely antagonistic towards each other. It's revealed that when the formula brings out Scarecrone the right side of her face becomes heavily scarred. This scarring is healed once the formula wears off and the Jenna Clarke personality becomes dominant again.\n\nThe Scarecrow is one of the main characters in Alex Ross' maxi-series \"Justice\" as part of the Legion of Doom. He is first seen out of costume in a hospital, injecting a girl in a wheelchair with a serum allowing her to walk. Scarecrow was later seen in costume during Lex Luthor's speech alongside Clayface inside the home of Black Canary and Green Arrow. Crane gases Canary while Clayface attacks Green Arrow, but the attack fails on Crane's end when Black Canary finds her husband attacked by Clayface. Oliver defeats Clayface by electrocuting him with a lamp, and the duo flee soon after Canary unleashes her Canary Cry. Scarecrow is later seen with Clayface and Parasite, having captured Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl, and Supergirl. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, Scarecrow does not appear to face any particular target and duels the League as a whole. He is one of the few villains to escape the League's initial attack. The Justice League follows Scarecrow to his city, whereupon he sends his city's population to attack the League, knowing that they would not hurt civilians. However, John Stewart's ring frees the city from Scarecrow's control, subsequently freeing Scarecrow from Brainiac's control. Scarecrow does not seem bothered by this realization, admitting he would have done it anyway. He causes a diversion by releasing his fear gas into his entire city, driving his citizens into a homicidal frenzy, and manages to escape capture, but he is ambushed and nearly killed by the Joker in retaliations for not having been invited to the Legion of Doom. Scarecrow's city is again saved by the Justice League.\n\nThe Scarecrow appears in the third and final chapter of \"\", in which his suit has been adorned with laces of severed fingers from past victims & all of his family; the bullies who tormented him in school. He is about to kill a former football player when vampire Batman appears, noting that Scarecrow is almost worse than him; he now has no choice but to kill, but Scarecrow has a choice and yet he chose to prey on innocents. Batman then grabs Scarecrow's vial of fear gas, crushing it along with the supervillain's hand, and cuts Scarecrow's head off with his own sickle, declaring that Scarecrow has no idea what fear really is.\n\nIn \"The Batman Adventures\" #1, Scarecrow is seen along some other Batman rogues at Arkham Asylum. In issue #9, Scarecrow is seen during a flashback sequence. Series writer Ty Templeton mentioned during an interview that he originally wanted to use the Scarecrow in a story which would have revealed why an accident and a murder trial provoked him to change his costume, as his face was never seen in \"The New Batman Adventures\" TV show, but the series was canceled before Scarecrow's mystery could have been revealed.\n\nIn the 2010 adaptation of \"Batman Beyond\", the character never appears on screen, but it is mentioned that Crane ended up retiring from his life of crime, and spent the last ten years of his life writing out experiments.\n\nIn the New 52 Batman Beyond books that takes place after \"Future's End\", the future Batman fights a new, female version of the Scarecrow named Adalyn Stern. As a child, Adalyn was traumatized when she witnessed Batman brutally beat up her father (who was a notorious gang leader). She was placed in institutional care until she was assigned to one of Jonathon Crane's disciples who attempted to treat her with technology derived from Crane's work, which only amplified her fear of Batman. She grows up and becomes a co-anchor to Jack Ryder on the News 52. She uses A.I. cubes placed in everyone's homes to brainwash the population into believing that the new Batman is a demonic monster that needs to be put down. She is eventually defeated by the combined efforts of the original and new Batman as well as Jack Ryder and is placed in Arkham Asylum afterwards when she views herself as nothing but the Scarecrow.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Scarecrow is one of the many villains subsequently killed by Batman.\n\nIn the \"\" graphic novel, Dr. Jonathan Crane is mentioned as the head of the Crane Institute for the Criminally Insane, and one of its escapees is one Ray Salinger, also known as the \"Birthday Boy\", used by Mayor Cobblepot to his advantages.\n\nIn \"\", the Mad Hatter mentioned that he acquired and modified Scarecrow's fear gas to make Batman see his \"Alices\" as various Alice in Wonderland characters who, in turn, were drugged by Hatter and placed under his control.\n\nThe Scarecrow appears in \"\"'s prequel comic. In Year One, the alternate universe's Joker poisons Scarecrow with his laughing toxin, which left him in a state of induced coma. Later, Scarecrow's body is found in S.T.A.R. Labs by the Flash, with his face twisted into a smile. Joker would use Scarecrow's fear toxin laced with kryptonite to make Superman see his wife Lois as Doomsday, causing the Man of Steel to accidentally murder her and seal Metropolis's fate. In Year Five, after awakening from his coma, Scarecrow goes to Bludhaven, where he meets with Black Mask, Man-Bat, Bronze Tiger, Mad Hatter, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Robin later arrives and fights the villains. When they start to overwhelm Robin, Deadman arrives and possesses Bronze Tiger to knock out the villains before calling for help.\n\nIn Injustice 2, Scarecrow is one of the many villains recruited by Gorilla Grodd to form The Society. After a battle with Wonder Woman , Scarecrow was injured as a result of Wonder Woman slicing his hand.\n\nIn \"Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" crossover, the Scarecrow appears mutated into a crow as one of the various other Arkham inmates mutated by Shredder and Foot Clan to attack Batman and Robin. Batman is captured, but Robin manages to escape. The Ninja Turtles and Splinter then arrive, where Splinter defeats the mutated villains, while Batman uses his new Intimidator Armor to defeat Shredder and the Turtles defeat Ra's al Ghul. Later, Gordon tells Batman that the police scientists have managed to turn all of the inmates at Arkham back to normal and are currently in A.R.G.U.S. custody.\n\nThe Scarecrow appears in \"Batman '66\" (which is based on the 1966 TV series). This version of the character was adopted in the childhood and raised in a small Appalachian town, aptly named Jitters Holler, after being abandoned by his parents. He also was bullied by his adoptive brother Zeke, who constantly scared Jonathan with a scarecrow. After heading off to college, Crane returns to exact his revenge in the citizens of Gotham City. While robbing the bank of Gotham, Scarecrow is confronted by Batman and Robin and, through a weapon created by himself, infects them with his fear gas, making them see their greatest fears and allowing the Scarecrow a chance to escape. After that, Batman and Robin follow a trail of clues which lead them to Jitters Holler, where they confront the villain and are able to defeat the Scarecrow after exposing him to his own fear gas.\n\nScarecrow has a minor appearance in the 2017 series \"\". Crane, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from Clayface’s body. This was done so that Napier, who was using Mad Hatter’s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Scarecrow and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of Gotham City’s poorer districts. Later on in the story, the control hat is stolen by Neo-Joker (the second Harley Quinn, who felt that Jack Napier was a pathetic abnormality while Joker was the true, beautiful personality), in an effort to get Napier into releasing the Joker persona.\n\nThe Scarecrow appears in \"Gotham\", portrayed by Charlie Tahan (in season one as well as season four's first half), and by David W. Thompson (in season four's second half). He is introduced in the first season episodes \"The Fearsome Dr. Crane\" and \"The Scarecrow\". His father Gerald Crane (portrayed by Julian Sands) creates the \"fear toxin\", a serum designed to eliminate fear, and then injects Jonathan with it. Detectives Jim Gordon and Harvey Bullock save Jonathan's life, but are too late to save his sanity; the toxin has left him in a state of perpetual terror, plagued by hallucinations of his greatest fear: scarecrows. He is next seen in the season four episode \"Pax Penguina\", in which he is institutionalized in Gotham Asylum, where the corrupt warden Reed uses his fears to keep him under control. A gang of criminals led by Grady Harris and Merton bribe Reed to give them Crane and forces him to re-create his father's fear toxin so they can use it to control Gotham City. Jonathan eventually embraces his fear and uses the toxin against Grady Harris after Merton and his fellow gang members were arrested. He then wreaks havoc on Gotham with the toxin as \"The Scarecrow\". In \"The Fear Reaper\", Crane invades Gotham Asylum and uses the fear gas on Warden Reed and other inmates causing the guards to flee. When Gordon confronts Scarecrow, he gets infected with fear gas until he overcomes it. After Gordon turns on the sprinklers and undoes the fear gas' effects on the inmates, Scarecrow got away. In \"A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups,\" Scarecrow is shown as an inmate at Arkham Asylum after getting apprehended at some point and is freed by Jervis Tetch where they collaborate in a plot that involves releasing all the inmates of Arkham Asylum. After Jervis is defeated by Jim Gordon, Scarecrow gasses the driver of his transport as he and Jerome free him for their next plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Scarecrow appears in the \"\" video game series. The version of the character as he first appeared sports a mechanical gauntlet strapped with four fluorescent hypodermic needles on his right hand, which he uses to inject fear toxin into his victims. His voiceover work was provided by vocal artist Dino Andrade in \"Arkham Asylum\" and the mobile game \"Arkham Underworld,\" and by actor John Noble in \"Arkham Knight\".\n\nIn the series' first game, Scarecrow's character design is shirtless, wearing a pair of tattered pants and emphasizing his overall skinny body type. Set free by the Joker during his takeover of Arkham Island, he appears several times over the course of the story using his fear toxin to make Batman experience powerful and nightmarish hallucinations. Presented with haunting images featuring his enemies as well as the deaths of his parents, Batman has to overcome each scenario by using a manifestation of his willpower, the Bat-Signal, to defeat Scarecrow in each hallucinatory instance.\n\nAfter his final defeat, Scarecrow eventually flees down to Killer Croc's lair in the bowels of the Asylum to dump his most potent toxin into Gotham's water supply in an attempt to drive Gotham City into madness. However, a hungry Croc suddenly attacks Scarecrow and attempts to eat him. Acting quickly, Batman activates his electric collar with a Batarang, and the monster disappears, dragging Scarecrow back into the water with him. In one of the three possible post-credits endings, Scarecrow's hand is seen emerging from the water and grabbing onto a floating box of the Titan formula, which was used to transform several of Joker's henchmen into large, mindless beasts.\n\nScarecrow is not physically present in the eponymous prison during the events of the series' second game, which takes place approximately one year after \"Arkham Asylum\". That prison, \"Arkham City,\" consists of a few districts in the larger Gotham City that have been walled off from the other neighborhoods of Gotham. It is administrated by Hugo Strange, with the story revealing its creation to be a step toward a plot of larger global domination by Strange and his master.\n\nWhile exploring Arkham City, the player can discover several artifacts and signals that point toward Scarecrow's continued activity in Gotham, and allusions to a future confrontation he is preparing for with Batman. Near the Industrial District, which has been claimed by the Joker, Batman can discover Scarecrow's discarded mask, which unlocks a story that gives ideas to Scarecrow's fate after his encounter with Killer Croc in the Asylum. In the story, it's revealed that nobody has laid eyes on Jonathan Crane since the night Batman saw him at the Asylum. While some write him off as having surely been killed by Croc, Batman maintains no such belief: he knows that Crane is still out there somewhere, and needs to be stopped.\n\nAlso in Arkham City's Industrial District, Batman can locate a small boat in the harbor that doesn't register anything out of the ordinary on his Detective Mode vision. When he lands on this boat and uses his Cryptographic Sequencer gadget to unlock a secret and hidden door, it opens to reveal several indications as to Scarecrow's activities. The most obvious sign is a nearly comatose test subject, one of the Joker's henchmen, tied to a chair and mostly unconscious. Looking further, you can see a flood of crawling cockroaches up the walls, as well as a document from Falcone Shipping indicating Crane's importation of live insects for undisclosed medical research. While monitoring radio frequencies in Arkham City, the player can also discover hidden broadcasts of a mysterious voice reading a sequence of numbers. When translated, the frequencies reveal three different phrases: the first says, \"I will return Batman!\" The second says, \"You will pay for what you have done to me!\" And the final code says, \"Fear will tear Gotham to shreds!\"\n\nIn the prequel game taking place roughly five years before the events of \"Arkham Asylum\" during the second year of Batman's crimefighting career, Scarecrow makes no physical appearance either as his costumed persona or as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Though not confirmed, it seems likely that by this point in the timeline he had yet to make his debut as Scarecrow.\n\nThere are a couple of allusions to Crane, however: after saving Vicki Vale and a group of other reporters in the opening segment taking place in Blackgate Penitentiary, the player can walk into the guard office to the right and see that Dr. Jonathan Crane has signed in several times to visit Blackgate inmates. Additionally, a flyer soliciting test subjects for Dr. Crane's research on fear can be found on the Penguin's ship, the \"Final Offer,\" docked at Amusement Mile.\n\nScarecrow appears in \"Batman: Arkham Knight\". Seeking revenge on Batman, Scarecrow re-emerges in Gotham City two years after being attacked by Killer Croc in Arkham Asylum. Scarecrow's appearance has changed drastically following his encounter with Killer Croc, with Scarecrow now sporting a leg brace and having his gas mask now permanently grafted on his face.\n\nScarecrow joins forces with a man known only as the \"Arkham Knight\", a paramilitary commander who commands a militia that answers only to him and Scarecrow. In his latest campaign against Gotham, Scarecrow unites all of Gotham's criminals in an attempt to finally kill Batman. At the beginning of the game, Scarecrow threatens to release his new strain of fear toxin on the streets of Gotham, resulting in the evacuation of most of the city's civilian population. The Arkham Knight's militia then conquers Gotham, preventing the authorities from interfering with Scarecrow's plan. Batman soon discovers that Scarecrow's new fear gas is being manufactured at the ACE Chemicals plant. Defeating the militia there, Batman confronts Scarecrow in the central mixing chamber, where the villain informs Batman that Barbara Gordon has been captured, before locking the hero inside the imploding facility. Batman manages to reduce the blast radius and narrowly escape, after contending with a hallucination of the deceased Joker.\n\nScarecrow later appears on an airship owned by magnate Simon Stagg, revealing that he had hired the businessman to create \"the Cloudburst:\" a device that will disperse his toxin in the form of a giant cloud over Gotham. When Stagg attempts to double-cross Scarecrow, the villain captures him and takes charge of the device. Scarecrow evades Batman once again, and the Cloudburst is extracted with the help of the Arkham Knight. After Batman destroys the device and Poison Ivy sacrifices herself to dissipate the fear gas using a weaponized network of plants, Batman tracks down the Arkham Knight to his headquarters and defeats him for the final time, discovering his identity as Jason Todd, his second partner to serve as Robin whom he believed for the last several years to have been killed by the Joker in the bowels of Arkham Asylum.\n\nAfter the Arkham Knight disappears, his militia swear their allegiance to Scarecrow and their new appointed commander, Deathstroke. Batman locates and confronts Scarecrow again, but the villain holds Barbara at gunpoint, and forces Commissioner Gordon to shoot Batman in exchange for his daughter's life. Scarecrow then betrays the Commissioner by pushing Barbara off the building. Though Gordon shot Batman, he did so in a reinforced area of his suit, which allowed him to save Barbara. In the mayhem, Scarecrow and his militia forces escape, now holding Commissioner Gordon hostage. After kidnapping an already incapacitated Robin, Scarecrow tells Batman to surrender at the abandoned Arkham Asylum, where he unmasks Batman as Bruce Wayne for the world to see, before injecting the crime-fighter with three full doses of fear toxin. Batman eventually overcomes the chemical, and is soon after freed by the newly-reformed Jason Todd, who has adopted a new persona as the \"Red Hood\" before Scarecrow can kill him. Batman subsequently injects Scarecrow with his own toxin, and the villain is subdued and taken into police custody.\n\nIn the freemium mobile game \"Batman: Arkham Underworld\" Scarecrow appears as a playable character. He is the last villain to be unlocked, after the player completes a mission for him, wielding a scythe and his fear gas to great effect, even being able to teleport short distances. The game takes place in an undetermined period before the events of \"Arkham Asylum\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For the American political candidate and businessman Thomas McNutt, see Collin Street Bakery\"\n\nThomas MacNutt (August 3, 1850 – February 5, 1927) was a Canadian politician who held national as well as province-wide office, as a former member of the House of Commons of Canada and the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. He won a number of significant recognized awards and honours in his career. Thomas MacNutt was one of the original eight people who comprised the Independent party, the precursor to the Progressive Party of Canada.\n\nMacNutt was born in Eastern Canada in Campbellton, New Brunswick on August 3, 1850 to Charles Stewart MacNutt and Emily Allison (née Sims) MacNutt. Thomas MacNutt attended elementary school on Prince Edward Island, and thereafter attended Ottawa grammar school and commercial college. Thomas MacNutt completed his schooling and served in the military as well as timber agent, surveyor, Indian agent, and colonization agent before entering politics. Many early immigrants felt that Thomas MacNutt was guide, and friend.\n\nUpon marrying Miss Margaret McFayden, Thomas and Margaret started a family in the Saltcoats area of Saskatchewan. Four children made up their family, Charles Arthur Macnutt, Thomas Russell MacNutt, Mary Lamont MacNutt, and Everett Alexander MacNutt.\n\n\nMacNutt was a member of the Territorial Assembly from 1902 until 1905. He was then a member of the Saltcoats constituency when he was the first Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1906. As a Speaker, the office required knowledge of the rules of the house and impartiality. He continued on in politics, becoming a member of the House of Commons at Ottawa, Ontario from 1908 until 1921. MacNutt entered politics as a Liberal Party of Saskatchewan supporter until 1917. He was elected in the 1905 Saskatchewan election as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) representing Saltcoats. He served with Premier Walter Scott of the Liberal Party. He resigned as MLA and served as a Member of Parliament (MP). He served in the House of Commons after the 1908 federal election, and represented the federal Saltcoats district. After the 1908 Saskatchewan election, MacNutt again represented the provincial Saltcoats and served with Premier Walter Scott. MacNutt subsequently won the 1911 and the 1917 federal elections in Saltcoats. The Unionist Party was formed in 1917 by Members of Parliament who supported the \"Union government\" formed by Sir Robert Borden during World War I. MacNutt was a Liberal-Unionist between 1917 and 1920. \nThere were eight who came together to form the Independent party which later became known as the Progressive Party of Canada.\n\nThe early Saskatchewan District of Landestreu was named in honour of the Honorable Thomas MacNutt Esq., and is now known as MacNutt\n\n\n"}

In 1837, the William Watson business was established in London for the manufacture of optical instruments. By the 1840s, the company moved into lanterns, slides and associated equipment. In 1868, the name was changed to W. Watson & Son and by this time were located at 313 High Holborn, London. In the 1870s, the company added photographic equipment and became known as a leading manufacturer of the \"Highest Class Photographic Instruments and Apparatus\" in England. Into the 1940s, the company remained at 313 High Holborn, London, England.\n\nOn 9 January 1881 William Watson died. In 1883, the name of the company was changed to W. Watson & Sons as the son, Charles Henry Watson joined the business. The 1883 Kelly's Business Directory listed both Charles Henry Watson and Henry Watson as associated with the Watson & Sons company located at 23 Walton Street, Aylesbury, England. In 1889, the company participated in the formation of a Photographic Trades Section of the London Chamber of Commerce. In 1894, the company exhibited scientific instruments at the Antwerp Exhibition.\n\nIn the 1890s, the business continued to grow and advertised in catalogues their factories for instruments, optical glass and cabinet work located at Fullwood Rents W.C. The warehouse and show room remained at 313 High Holborn. In 1900, W. Watson & Sons purchased the John Browning & Co. In 1903, a section in the journal \"Knowledge\" lists an assortment of equipment available from the company: microscopes, astronomical telescopes (educational model for £5 1s), Crookes' spinthariscope (pocket model for £1 1s), and Electro-Therapeutics apparatus that included complete outfits for radiography from £30. The company also offered Finsen-type lamps.\n\nIn 1908, the firm became W. Watson & Sons Ltd. On 10 August 1938, Charles Henry Watson died. In 1912, the company employed their equipment and demonstrated the utilization of alternating current electricity to enhance the growth of plants in a nursery near London. In 1929, an advertisement in the British Industries Fair Catalogue announced an Optical, Scientific and Photographic Exhibit. The exhibition featured manufacturers of microscopes for medical, industrial, and educational purposes and for the amateur, prism binoculars, astronomical and portable telescopes, photographic lenses and cameras, surveying and measuring instruments, photometers, and scientific apparatus of every description. The W. Watson & Son company exhibited in the Scientific Section at Stand No. N.24. In 1947, the firm was a Listed Exhibitor at the British Industries Fair. The Fair featured manufacturers of microscopes for all purposes and auxiliary optical and mechanical accessories. The company offered photometers, telescopes, prism binoculars, photographic lenses of all types, and optical elements in every form. W. Watson & Son exhibited in the Olympia Room, Ground Floor at Stand No. A.1020.\n\nIn January 1905, the display of apparatus at the Annual Meeting and Exhibition of the British Electrotherapeutic Society was quite remarkable. Those in attendance were treated to items and displays of much interest, several items on display for the first time. High frequency apparatus was featured to a lesser extent than shown in previous years, but appliances for Röntgen ray work were plentiful.

They were a fringe group in Powhatan's Confederacy. In the mid-seventeenth century, the colonial court of Virginia ordered them to merge with a smaller tribe; the group was known as Wicocomico when assigned a reservation of near Dividing Creek, south of the Great Wicomico River.\n\nAfter losing the last of their reservation land in the early 1700s, the tribe disappeared from the historical record and was considered extinct. Since the late twentieth century, descendants have organized, documented history and genealogy, and are seeking recognition.\n\nThe Wicocomico people were encountered by Captain John Smith in 1608 as he explored Virginia. He notes a village of about 130 men on the South side of the mouth of the Patawomeke (Potomac) River.\n\nThe Northumberland County Court began interfering in the governance of the local tribes by the mid-1600s. Sometime between 1652 and 1655, the Court directed the Wicocomico and Chicacoan (or Sekakawons) tribes to merge and relocate slightly south of the Great Wicomico River. They were given 50 acres per fighting man, for a total of near Dividing Creek. The Lower Cuttatawomen probably merged with them between 1656 and 1659. The merged tribes' adopted the name of \"Wicocomico\" as that group were the most numerous. The Court appointed \"Machywap\" (formerly King of the Chicacoan) as the weroance of the combined tribes, as he was considered a friend of the English and easy to manage. By 1659, the Wicocomico had deposed Machywap, possibly by force, and replaced him with \"Pekwem\" as their weroance.\n\nThere were constant problems with the colonists' encroachment on their lands. From 1660 to 1673, the Wicocomico frequently challenged colonists in court over land disputes. Although most disputes were settled in favor of the Wicocomico, by 1719 they retained only of their original reservation. In 1705, Robert Beverley, Jr. wrote \"In Northumberland, Wiccocomoco, has but three men living, which yet keep up their Kingdom, and retain their Fashion; they live by themselves, separate from all other Indians, and from the English.\" After June 1719 and the death of William Taptico, the last Wicocomico weroance, the English took the lands. The remnants of the Wicocomico dispersed, and the tribe has been considered extinct. In 1730, the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730 declared that one of the public tobacco warehouses should be \"At Wiccocomico, at Robert Jones's; and at Coan, at the warehouses in Northumberland, under one inspection.\" \n\nSince the late 20th century, according to their website, descendants of Chief Taptico have worked to document their genealogy and history, as well as to re-organize as a tribe known as the Wicocomico Indian Nation. They have not received state or federal recognition, although they are preparing required documentation for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n"}
