His father, Ngabehi Soero Pernollo, served the Dutch East India Company in various capacities before being appointed \"politiehoofd\", or police head, of Besuki and Panarukan in 1764. One of his sisters married Pakunataningrat I, Sultan of Sumenep (reigned 1812 - 1854). Other prominent members of his family include his younger brother, Raden Soero Adiwikromo; his uncle, Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen (1727 – 1778); and his cousins, Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen (1759 – 1827), and Han Kik Ko, Majoor der Chinezen (1766 – 1813). His family played an important role in the consolidation of Dutch rule and subsequent administration of East Java.\n\nBaba Sam's career in the colonial administration began with his appointment by the Dutch East India Company in 1772 as \"Ronggo\", or district head, of Besuki under the Javanese name of Soemodiwirjo. He obtained this post thanks to the intercession of his powerful uncle, Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen of Surabaya and \"pachter\", or leaseholder, of the district of Besuki. In 1776, Baba Sam was promoted to the higher position of \"Tumanggung\" of Bangil with the successive noble titles of Ngabehi Soero Widjojo (1776 – 1788) and Tumanggung Soero Adinegoro (1788 – 1808). According to Jacques Julien de Labillardière and Ch. F. Tombe, French travellers during the Interregnum in Java (1806 – 1815), the Tumanggung not only spoke good Dutch, but was also a keen admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte and the latter's administrative policies in Europe.\n\nHerman Willem Daendels, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies (1808 – 1811) during the Interregnum, paid a visit to the Tumanggung's district of Bangil in 1808. Impressed by the good governance of the district, Daendels later that same year made the Tumanggung a \"Ridder\", or Knight, in the Order of Holland, recently founded in 1807 by Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland.\n\nA year later, in 1809, Daendels conferred upon the Tumanggung the dignity of \"Adipati\", the highest title in the \"priyayi\", or Javanese aristocracy. Adipati Soero Adinegoro was also elevated to the post of Regent of Malang. Later, the regencies of Sidayu and Tuban were added to his now considerable jurisdiction. Many of his sons also held government appointments in the colonial administration.\n\nIn 1818, however, the Adipati and his sons were suddenly relieved of their government positions. It was thought that the Dutch government felt threatened by the organised power of the Han family of Lasem, and wanted to reassert control over the Eastern Salient of Java.\n\nAdipati Soero Adinegoro died in 1833.\n\nThe Adipati had a total of twenty-six children. He gave up one of them, \"Raden\" Panderman (born in 1778), in adoption to his childless successor and younger brother, Raden Soero Adiwikromo, who was Ronggo of Besuki (1776), Tumanggung of Puger and Bondowoso (1796), and finally Regent of Tegal. Raden Panderman eventually succeeded his adoptive father and uncle, with the patronage of Majoor Han Chan Piet, the landlord of Besuki, as Ronggo of Besuki in 1794, Tumanggung of Puger and Besuki in 1804, then as Regent of Puger in 1813, but was demoted along with his other brothers in the purge of 1818.\n\nRaden Panderman's issue, however, managed to retain their position in the colonial administration, and continued their family's tradition of public service in East Java. The most prominent line descending from Raden Panderman is that of his son, Raden Karaman, later known as \"Kyai Tumanggung\" Soero Adhi Negoro, who was appointed Tumanggung of Kendal, then Regent of Probolinggo in 1856. The latter was succeeded in Kendal by his son, \"Pangeran Ario\" Noto Amiprodjo; grandson, \"Raden Mas Adipati Ario\" Notonegoro; and great-grandson, \"Raden Mas Adipati Ario\" Notohamidjojo, who all served successively as Regents of Kendal.\n\n"}

{"id": "594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=594", "title": "Apollo", "text": "Apollo\n\nApollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , \"Apollōn\" ( ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the \"kouros\" (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as \"Apulu\".\n\nAs the patron of Delphi (\"Pythian Apollo\"), Apollo was an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle.\n\nMedicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague.\n\nAs an archer who never missed, Apollo carried a golden bow (silver bow, sometimes) and a quiver of golden arrows. As the inventor of archery and taught the same to the people. His arrows could inflict harm by causing sudden deaths or deadly plague.\n\nAs the leader of the Muses (\"Apollon Musegetes\") and director of their choir, Apollo functions as the patron god of music and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music. The Cithara and the lyre are also his inventions. The lyre is a common attribute of Apollo. Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans.\n\nApollo favors and delights in the foundation of towns and the establishment of civil constitution. Hence is associated with dominion over colonists. Additionally, he is the god of foreigners, the protector of fugitives and refugees.\n\nApollo is the giver and interpreter of laws. He presides over the divine law and custom along with Zeus, Demeter and Themis.\n\nAs the protector of young, Apollo (\"kourotrophos\") is concerned with the health of children. He presides over their education and brings them out of their adolescence. Due to this belief, boys in Ancient Greece, upon reaching their adulthood, cut their hair and dedicated it to Apollo.\n\nHe is the patron of herdsmen and protector of herds and flocks. He is believed to cause abundance in the milk produced by cattle, and is also connected with their fertility.\n\nApollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil. He delivered men from the epidemics. Various epithets call him the \"averter of evil\".\n\nAs an agricultural deity, Apollo protects the crops from diseases, especially the rust in corns and grains. He is also the controller and destroyer of pests that infect plants and plant harvests.\n\nIn Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as \"Apollo Helios\" he became identified among Greeks with Helios, Titan god of the sun. In Latin texts, however, there was no conflation of Apollo with Sol among the classical Latin poets until 1st century AD. Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.\n\nApollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , \"Apollōn\" ( ); Doric: , \"Apellōn\"; Arcadocypriot: , \"Apeilōn\"; Aeolic: , \"Aploun\"; )\n\nThe name \"Apollo\"—unlike the related older name \"Paean\"—is generally not found in the Linear B (Mycenean Greek) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form \"]pe-rjo-[\" (Linear B: ]-[) on the KN E 842 tablet.\n\nThe etymology of the name is uncertain. The spelling ( in Classical Attic) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form, \"Apellon\" (), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier . It probably is a cognate to the Doric month \"Apellaios\" (), and the offerings apellaia () at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai (). \nAccording to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word \"apella\" (), which originally meant \"wall,\" \"fence for animals\" and later \"assembly within the limits of the square.\" Apella () is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta, corresponding to the \"ecclesia\" (). R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun \"apellai\" and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *\"Apalun\".\n\nSeveral instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb (\"apollymi\"), \"to destroy\". Plato in \"Cratylus\" connects the name with (\"apolysis\"), \"redemption\", with (\"apolousis\"), \"purification\", and with (\"[h]aploun\"), \"simple\", in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, , and finally with (\"aeiballon\"), \"ever-shooting\". Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric (\"apella\"), which means \"assembly\", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation (\"sekos\"), \"fold\", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds. In the ancient Macedonian language (\"pella\") means \"stone,\" and some toponyms may be derived from this word: (Pella, the capital of ancient Macedonia) and (\"Pellēnē\"/\"Pallene\").\n\nA number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name, The Hittite form \"Apaliunas\" (\"\") is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter, perhaps related to Hurrian (and certainly the Etruscan) \"Aplu\", a god of plague, in turn likely from Akkadian \"Aplu Enlil\" meaning simply \"the son of Enlil\", a title that was given to the god Nergal, who was linked to Shamash, Babylonian god of the sun.\nThe role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of Apollo Smintheus (\"mouse Apollo\") by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is apotropaic, meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague).\n\nThe Hittite testimony reflects an early form \"\", which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot with Doric . The name of the Lydian god \"Qλdãns\" /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y \">\" d. Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric \"Ἀπέλjων\" and Hittite \"Apaliunas\".\n\nA Luwian etymology suggested for \"Apaliunas\" makes Apollo \"The One of Entrapment\", perhaps in the sense of \"Hunter\".\n\nApollo's chief epithet was Phoebus ( ; , \"Phoibos\" ), literally \"bright\". It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in Latin literature.\n\n\n\nApollo's birthplace was Mount Cynthus on the island of Delos.\n\n\nDelphi and Actium were his primary places of worship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo was worshipped throughout the Roman Empire. In the traditionally Celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with Celtic gods of similar character.\n\nThe cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of Pytho. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with \"healing\". In classical Greece he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil. Walter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed \"a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.\"\n\nFrom his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of \"symbols and omina\" (σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα : \"sēmeia kai terata\"), and of the observation of the omens of the days. The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from Anatolia. The ritualism belonged to Apollo from the beginning. The Greeks created the legalism, the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, ideal beauty, fine arts, philosophy, moderation, spiritual-life, the protector of music, divine law and perceptible order. The improvement of the old Anatolian god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the Greek people.\n\nThe function of Apollo as a \"healer\" is connected with Paean (), the physician of the Gods in the \"Iliad\", who seems to come from a more primitive religion. Paeοn is probably connected with the Mycenean \"pa-ja-wo-ne\" (Linear B: ), but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song \"paean\" (). The magicians were also called \"seer-doctors\" (), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.\n\nIn the \"Iliad\", Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra. He sends a plague () to the Achaeans. The god who sends a disease can also prevent it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a hecatomb to ward off evil. When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the \"Paean\".\n\nSome common epithets of Apollo as a healer are \"paion\" ( literally \"healer\" or \"helper\") \"epikourios\" (, \"succouring\"), \"oulios\" (, \"healer, baleful\") and \"loimios\" (, \"of the plague\"). In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called \"apotropaios\" (, \"averting evil\") and \"alexikakos\" ( \"keeping off ill\"; from v. + n. ). In later writers, the word, usually spelled \"Paean\", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing.\n\nHomer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph.\nSuch songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to Dionysus, to Apollo Helios, to Apollo's son Asclepius the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.\n\nThe connection with the Dorians and their initiation festival \"apellai\" is reinforced by the month \"Apellaios\" in northwest Greek calendars. The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo (Doric: ). \"Apellaios\" is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the \"megistos kouros\" (the great Kouros). However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the Ancient Macedonian word \"pella\" (Pella), \"stone\". Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (Omphalos).\n\nThe \"Homeric hymn\" represents Apollo as a Northern intruder. His arrival must have occurred during the \"Dark Ages\" that followed the destruction of the Mycenaean civilization, and his conflict with Gaia (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent Python.\n\nThe earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle. The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated. A female dragon named Delphyne (; cf. , \"womb\"), and a male serpent Typhon (; from , \"to smoke\"), the adversary of Zeus in the Titanomachy, who the narrators confused with Python. Python was the good daemon (ἀγαθὸς δαίμων) of the temple as it appears in Minoan religion, but she was represented as a dragon, as often happens in Northern European folklore as well as in the East.\n\nApollo and his sister Artemis can bring death with their arrows. The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in Germanic and Norse mythology. In Greek mythology Artemis was the leader (, \"hegemon\") of the nymphs, who had similar functions with the Nordic Elves. The \"elf-shot\" originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.\n\nThe Vedic Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called \"The Archer\", and the bow is also an attribute of Shiva. Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba is a healer physician god. However the Indo-European component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.\n\nIt seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the Mycenaean age. In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called Lab(r)yadai, \"the double-axe men\", which indicates Minoan origin. The double-axe, labrys, was the holy symbol of the Cretan labyrinth. The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. \"Apollo Delphinios\" or \"Delphidios\" was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands. Apollo's sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan \"Mistress of the animals\". In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the \"Mister of the animals\", a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin \"Mistress of the Animals\", becoming her brother.\n\nThe old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple. This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress Sibyl of Anatolian origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself. However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.\n\nPlato describes the priestesses of Delphi and Dodona as frenzied women, obsessed by \"mania\" (, \"frenzy\"), a Greek word he connected with \"mantis\" (, \"prophet\"). Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the Near East as Mari in the second millennium BC. Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC, there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages. It is more probable that this art was introduced later from Anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.\n\nA non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship. The name of Apollo's mother Leto has Lydian origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain \"purification\".\n\nA similar story is mentioned by Plutarch. He writes that the Cretan seer Epimenides purified Athens after the pollution brought by the Alcmeonidae, and that the seer's expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to Solon in his reform of the Athenian state. The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of Asia, and proves, together with the Homeric hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to Anatolia.\n\nHomer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans, fighting against the Achaeans, during the Trojan War. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to \"Appaliunas\", a tutelary god of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete. The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of \"Artimus\" (Artemis) and \"Qλdãns\", whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving Lydian texts\".\" However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of \"Qλdãns\" with Apollo.\n\nThe Greeks gave to him the name \"agyieus\" as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column. However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (\"sibutu\") indicates a Babylonian origin.\n\nThe Late Bronze Age (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) Hittite and Hurrian \"Aplu\" was a god of plague, invoked during plague years. Here we have an apotropaic situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning \"the son of\", was a title given to the god Nergal, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash. Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god () who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods. In \"Iliad\", his priest prays to \"Apollo Smintheus\", the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats. All these functions, including the function of the healer-god Paean, who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.\n\nUnusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: Delos and Delphi. In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality. Apollo's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period, and the frequency of theophoric names such as \"Apollodorus\" or \"Apollonios\" and cities named \"Apollonia\" testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at Didyma and Clarus pronounced the so-called \"theological oracles\", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing, highest deity. \"In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. Julian the Apostate (359–361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.\"\n\nApollo had a famous oracle in Delphi, and other notable ones in Clarus and Branchidae. His oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis, where he bore the toponymic epithet \"Abaeus\" (, \"Apollon Abaios\"), was important enough to be consulted by Croesus.\nHis oracular shrines include:\n\nOracles were also given by sons of Apollo.\n\nMany temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection. From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.\nThe Doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order, but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.\n\nThe most important temples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo appears often in the myths, plays and hymns. As Zeus' favorite son, Apollo had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.\n\nWhen Zeus' wife Hera discovered that Leto was impregnanted by Zeus, she banned Leto from giving birth on \"terra firma\". In her wanderings, Leto sought shelter on many lands, only to be rejected by them. Finally, Apollo, still in Leto's womb, spoke to his mother and told her about the newly created floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island. Leto, when welcomed by Delos, gave birth there, clinging to a palm tree.\n\nIt is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards or 8.2 meters long.\nWhen Apollo was born clutching a golden sword, the swans circled Delos seven times and the nymphs sang in delight. Soon after he was born, he was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in white garment, with golden bands fastened around him. Since Leto was unable to feed the new born, Themis, the goddess of divine law, fed him the nectar, or ambrosia. Upon tasting the divine food, Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind.\nApollo was a precocious child. Even before he was born, in anger he had foretold the fate of Niobe and the death of Python during Leto's wanderings. Leto was accepted by the people of Delos and she promised them that her son would be always favorable towards the city. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. This island later became sacred to Apollo.\n\nApollo was born on the seventh day (, \"hebdomagenes\") of the month Thargelion —according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him. Mythographers agree that Artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.\n\nAs a child, Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he later became \"Archegetes\", the founder of towns and god who guided men to build new cities.\n\nIn his young years when Zeus had ignored him, Apollo spent his time herding cows. There, he was reared by Thriae, the bee nymphs, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills. During this time, Apollo also invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery. Phoebe, his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of Delphi to Apollo as a birthday gift. Themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi thereon.\n\nLater, with his bow and arrows that he had received from Hephaestus, Apollo went in search of the chthonic dragon Python, which lived in Delphi beside the Castalian Spring, and was a terror to the people. Hera had sent this serpent to hunt the pregnant Leto to her death across the world. To avenge the trouble given to his mother, Apollo killed Python in the sacred cave at Delphi with his arrows. Even though he had freed the people from a great bane, Python was a child of Gaia. Zeus, not wanting to incur her anger, decided to punished Apollo.\n\nZeus banned Apollo from Olympus, and told him to purify himself. Exiled, Apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years. He also travelled to Crete, where Carmanor performed purification rites on him. Further, Zeus ordered him to go to the Vale of Tempe and bath in waters of Peneus. Apollo later established the Pythian games to appropriate Gaia. Only after this, he was given his place on Olympus. Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.\n\nZeus, for his son's integrity, gave Apollo the seat next to him on his right side. He also gifted to Apollo a golden tripod, bow and arrows, a golden chariot drawn by swans and the land of Delphi.\n\nSoon after his return, Apollo needed to recruit people to Delphi. So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god. Initiating them to his service, he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts. The Pythia was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies. Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals. \n\nHera once again sent another giant, Tityos to rape Leto. This time Apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword. According to variations, Artemis aided in protecting their mother by attacking with her arrows. After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver.\n\nOnce Apollo, along with Athena and Poseidon, participated in Hera's scheme to hold Zeus captive and demand a better rule from him. This was unsuccessful and Zeus, feeling beatryed, sent Apollo and Poseidon to serve as slaves under the Trojan king Laomedon. According to varied version, both gods went to test Laomedon. Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy. There, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, and sired a son Ileus by her.\n\nLater, Apollo was also compelled by Laomedon to build the walls. Apollo obeyed, and by playing on his lyre, he built the walls of Troy. However, the king refused to give them the wages he had promised. Angered, Apollo sent a pestilence to the city. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter Hesione (who would later be saved by Heracles).\n\nApollo sided with the Trojans during the Trojan war, a war waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.\n\nDuring the war, Agamemnon, a Greek hero captured Chryseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest Chryses. Angered, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded to return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the \"anger of Achilles\", which is the theme of the \"Iliad\".\n\nReceiving the aegis from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry, pushing them back and destroying many of them. He is described as \"the rouser of armies\", because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.\n\nWhen Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he wouldn't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.\n\nWhen Diomedes, the greek hero, injured Aeneas, a Trojan ally, Aphrodite tried to rescue him but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy, where he was healed.\n\nAfter the death of Sarpedon, a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep (Hypnos) and Death (Thanatos). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.\n\nThe Trojan hero Hector was favored by Apollo, who, according to some, was the god's own son by Hecuba. When he got injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up the arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse.\n\nThe Greek warrior Patroclus tried to get into the fort of Troy and was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of Patroclus and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector.\n\nApollo held anger towards Achilles throughout the war. The reason for this was the murder of his son Tenes before the war began, and brutal assassination of his another son Troilus in his own temple, both by Achilles. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body.\nFinally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by Paris into Achilles' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.\n\nApollo helped many Trojan warriors, including Agenor, Polydamas, Glaucus in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.\n\nWhen Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus. Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus forever for this, but his mother Leto intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of hard labor.\n\nDuring this time he served as herdsman for King Admetus of Pherae in Thessaly. His mere presence is said to have made the cows give birth to twins. Apollo shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.\nAdmetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus. Out of love and gratitude, Apollo helped Admetus win Alcestis, the daughter of King Pelias and later convinced, or tricked the Fates to let Admetus live past his time.\n\nThe love between Apollo and Admetus was a favorite topic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius.\n\nThe fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb. Niobe was the queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion. She displayed hubris when she boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.\n\nA devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river Achelous. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.\n\nAs a child, Apollo built an altar made of goat horns which was considered as one of the wonders of the world.\nIn the first Olympic games, Apollo defeated Ares and became the victor in wrestling. He outran Hermes in the race and won first place.\nApollo killed Aloadae, the twin giants, when they attempted to storm Mt. Olympus.\nDuring the gigantomachy, Apollo killed the giant Ephialtes and with Zeus, he killed Porphyrion, the king of giants.\n\nWhen Odysseus, with the help of Athena, attacked the Bryges (backed by Ares), he lost. This caused Athena and Ares to enter into a direct duel. Their fight continued until Apollo intervened between the war siblings and resolved the conflict.\n\nWhen Heracles tried to steal the Delphic tripod to start his own Oracle, he was stopped by Apollo. A duel ensued between Apollo and Heracles where Athena supported the latter. Soon, Zeus intervened to stop the fight and punished Heracles for his act.\n\nWhen Phorbas, a robber, had seized the roads to Delphi and was harassing the pilgrims, Apollo defeated and killed him in a boxing match. \nApollo rescued Hemithea and Parthenos, sisters of Rhoeo from their drunk father and turned them into goddesses.\n\nApollo rescued several dryads from drowning during the war against Indians waged by Dionysus.\n\nWhen the Argonauts were facing a terrible storm, Jason prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon the island Anafi, where the Argonauts soon took shelter.\n\nApollo helped the Greek hero, Diomedes, to escape from a great tempest. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of \"Apollo Epibaterius\", \"Apollo the embarker\".\n\nPeriphas, a noble king, was honoured to the same extent as Zeus by mortals. Due to this Zeus wished to destroy him. But Apollo requested his father not to do so, since Periphas was a virtuous man. Zeus agreed and metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle his companion.\n\nApollo spoke to Zeus regarding Prometheus, the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. Apollo, with tears in his eyes, pleaded Zeus to release the kind Titan. Zeus, moved by Apollo's words and the tears of Artemis and Leto, sent Heracles to free Prometheus.\nChiron, the abandoned centaur was fostered by Apollo who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron's calm nature and wisdom, in contrast to rest of the centaurs, is attributed to the education Apollo gave him.\n\nApollo adopted Carnus, the abandoned son of Zeus and Europa. He fostered him with the help of his mother Leto and later educated the child. \nApollo personally readied his son Aristaeus for the Indian war by providing him with bow, arrows and a shield. Later on, he also rescued Aristaeus from drowning in a river during the war.\n\nAnius, Apollo's son by Rhoeo, was abandoned by his mother. Apollo brought him up and educated him. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos. In a similar fashion, he had educated his sons Idmon and Iamus (by taking him to Olympia).\n\nUpon the death of his son Idmon, Apollo commanded the Megarians and Boetians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him for his bravery and sacrifice.\n\nApollo saved a shepherd (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.\n\nApollo guided Aphrodite to his sanctuary when she was grief-stricken with Adonis' death. He helped her free herself from the heartbreak.\nApollo divides months into summer and winter. He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of Dionysus, and no prophecies were given during winters.\n\nApollo's music is soulful and enchanting. His music would deliver people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.\n\nApollo is often seen as the companion of the Muses and as \"Musagetes\", he leads them into dance while he sang. He is found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre. Apollo and the Muses are often seen on Parnassus, which is one of their favorite spots.\n\nApollo was always invited to play music on weddings of the gods, like the marriage of Eros and Psyche, Peleus and Thetis.\n\nThe invention of lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself. Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, where as the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.\n\nMyths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near Pylos, covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a tortoise and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre.\n\nUpon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.\n\nAccording to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repent to the excess punishment he had given to Marsyas. Hermes' lyre, therefore, is rather a reinvention.\n\nApollo participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all the contests, but usually punished his opponents severely for their hubris.\n\nOnce Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge Apollo, the god of music. The mountain-god Tmolus was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone were pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a donkey.\n\nMarsyas was a satyr who was punished by Apollo for his hubris.\n\nHe had found an aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the Muses. The contestants agreed to the rule that the victor can do anything with the loser.\n\nAfter they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage. But Apollo presented the counterpoint that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was same as singing. The judges agreed with Apollo. Apollo played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and not singing. Apollo was declared the winner because of this.\n\nAccording to some, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.\nAnother variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the flute), and so Apollo hung him from a tree to flay him alive.\n\nApollo flayed Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god. He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But, as an act of repent and purification for killing Marsyas, he tore the strings of his lyre. Staying away from music for a long time, he isolated himself and wandered with Cybele till he reached Hyperborea, his mother's native.\n\nCinyras was a ruler of Cyprus, who was a friend of Agamemnon. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a lyre-playing contest with Cinyras, and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.\n\nLove affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology. Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.\n\nDaphne was a nymph whose parentage varies. She scorned Apollo's adavnces and ran away from him. When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and Gaea helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place. According to Roman poet Ovid, the chase was brought about by Cupid, who hit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred. The myth explains the origin of the laurel and connection of Apollo with the laurel and it's leaves, which his priestess employed at Delphi. The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the Pythian games.\nApollo is said to have been the lover of all nine Muses, and not being able to choose one of them, decided to remain unwed. He fathered the Corybantes by the Muse Thalia, Orpheus by Calliope, Linus of Thrace by Calliope or Urania and Hymenaios(Hymen) by either Terpsichore or Clio or Calliope.\nCyrene, was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her its ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, Aristaeus, and Idmon.\n\nEvadne was a nymph daughter of Poseidon and a lover of Apollo. She bore him a son, Iamos. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth to assist her.\n\nRhoeo, a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named Anius. Not wanting to have the child, she entrusted the infant to Apollo and left. Apollo raised and educated the child on his own.\n\nOurea, a daughter of Poseidon, fell in love with Apollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king Laomedon. They both united on the day the walls of Troy were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion (Troy). Ileus was very dear to Apollo.\n\nThero, daughter of Phylas, a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return. By their union, she became mother of Chaeron, who was famed as \"the tamer of horses\". He later built the city Chaeronea.\n\nHyrie or Thyrie was the mother of Cycnus. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.\n\nHecuba was the wife of King Priam of Troy, and Apollo had a son with her named Troilus. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by Achilleus, and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles.\n\nCoronis, was daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths. While pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis' belly and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise.\n\nIn Euripides' play \"Ion\", Apollo fathered Ion by Creusa, wife of Xuthus. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked Hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at Delphi, where he was raised by a priestess.\n\nHyacinth or Hyacinthus was Apollo's favorite lover. He was a Spartan prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the discus when the discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning \"alas\". He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival Hyacinthia was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.\nAnother male lover was Cyparissus, a descendant of Heracles. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by it's death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.\n\nAdmetus, the king of Pherae, was Apollo's another dear lover. During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years, Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. Developing a passion for the king there, he herded and fed the cattle, and caused the cows to give birth to twin calves. He would make cheese and serve it to Admetus and was often seen being domestic, causing embarrassment to his family. \nWhen Admetus wanted to marry princess Alcestis, Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis' father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis' wrath and also convinced the Moirai to postpone Admetus' death once.\n\nBranchus, a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.\n\nOther male lovers of Apollo include:\n\n\nApollo sired many children, from mortal women, nymphs as well as the goddesses. His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings. They were all usually very beautiful.\n\nAsclepius is the most famous son of Apollo. Apollo brought the child into the world by performing cesarean. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but later upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god.\n\nAristaeus, the son of Apollo and Cyrene, was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon the humanity.\n\nThe Corybantes were spear-clashing, dancing demigods. They were seven sons of Apollo and the nymph Rhetia or the Muse Thalia.\n\nApollo's children who became musicians and bards include Orpheus, Linus, Ialemus, Hymenaeus, Philammon, and Eleuther.\n\nApis, Idmon, Iamus, Tenerus, Mopsus and others were gifted seers. Anius, Pythaeus and Ismenus lived as high priests. Most of them were trained by Apollo himself.\n\nDelphos, Dryops, Miletos, Tenes, Epidaurus, Ceos, Lycoras, Syrus, Pisus, Marathus, Acraepheus, Cicon, Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo, under the guidance of his words, founded eponymous cities.\n\nApollo fathered 3 daughters, Nete, Mese, Hypate, who formed a minor group of Muses, the \"Musa Apollonides\". They were worshipped at Apollo's shrine in Delphi and are named after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre. His other daughters are Phemonoe (the poetess and seer), Eriopis (known for her lovely hair), Pamphile (silk weaver), Phoebe and Hilyra (the wives of Dioscuri), Parthenos (turned into a constellation upon her death) and by some accounts, Scylla.\n\nAdditionally, Apollo fostered and educated Chiron, the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered Carnus, the son of Zeus and Europa.\n\nMarpessa was kidnapped by Idas but was loved by Apollo as well. Zeus made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.\n\nSinope, a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.\n\nBolina was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph and let her go.\n\nCastalia was a nymph whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the spring at Delphi, at the base of Mt. Parnassos, which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.\n\nCassandra, was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.\n\nHestia, the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.\n\nArtemis as the sister of Apollo, is \"thea apollousa\", that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo. However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual, which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the Hellenic period.\n\nArtemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang. The laurel was sacred to both. \"Artemis Daphnaia\" had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi. In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or Helios, Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon. \nThe Laurel was sacred to both. \"Apollo Daphnephoros\" had a temple in Eretria, a \"place where the citizens are to take the oaths.\n\nHecate, the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers - Leto and Asteria - are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, \"Hecatos\", is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean \"working from afar\". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness. If Hecate is the \"gate-keeper\", Apollo \"Agyieus\" is the \"door-keeper\". Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.\n\nThe oldest evidence found for Hecate's worship is at Apollo's temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis. Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrats and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.\n\nAs a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of Athena. Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principle goddess of Athens, Apollo was the principle god of Sparta.\n\nAs patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the Muses, the former a much more frequent companion than the latter. Apollo was somtimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus due to his wise and artistic nature.\n\nIn the Trojan war, as Zeus' executive, Apollo is seen holding the aegis like Athena usually does. Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.\n\nIn Aeschylus' \"Oresteia\" trilogy, Clytemnestra kills her husband, King Agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, Orestes, is to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the Erinyes or Furies (female personifications of vengeance).\n\nApollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's supplicant. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.\n\nThe Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. As a quintessentially Greek god, Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus. There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus.\n\nOn the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's first temple at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the \"Apollinare\". During the Second Punic War in 212 BCE, the \"Ludi Apollinares\" (\"Apollonian Games\") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius. In the time of Augustus, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.\n\nAfter the battle of Actium, which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour. He also erected a new temple to the god on the Palatine hill. Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana formed the culmination of the Secular Games, held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.\n\nThe chief Apollonian festival was the Pythian Games held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great Panhellenic Games. Also of major importance was the Delia held every four years on Delos.\nAthenian annual festivals included the Boedromia, Metageitnia, Pyanepsia, and Thargelia.\nSpartan annual festivals were the Carneia and the Hyacinthia.\nThebes every nine years held the Daphnephoria.\n\nApollo's most common attributes were the bow and arrow. Other attributes of his included the kithara (an advanced version of the common lyre), the plectrum and the sword. Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers. The Pythian Games were held in Apollo's honor every four years at Delphi. The bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games.\n\nThe palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in Delos. Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins, roe deer, swans, cicadas (symbolizing music and song), hawks, ravens, crows, snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and griffins, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.\nAs god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped Cretan or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: Hittite cuneiform texts mention a Minor Asian god called \"Appaliunas\" or \"Apalunas\" in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of \"Lykegenes\" can simply be read as \"born in Lycia\", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a folk etymology).\n\nIn literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of Dionysus, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the Borghese Vase.\n\nApollo is often associated with the Golden Mean. This is the Greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony.\n\nApollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the Renaissance. The earliest Greek word for a statue is \"delight\" (, \"agalma\"), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.\n\nThe naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.\n\nThe evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal Kouros type in early archaic period, to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period. In classical Greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by Polykleitos. Finally Praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization.\n\nThe evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of Thales to the metaphysical theory of Pythagoras. Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older animism. This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.\n\nPythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation. The forms on earth, are imperfect imitations (, \"eikones\", \"images\") of the celestial world of numbers. His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art. The Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection. (canon).\n\nIn classical Greece, Anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and Plato extended the Greek belief of \"ideal forms\" to his metaphysical theory of \"forms\" (\"ideai\", \"ideas\"). The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words \"oida\" (, \"(I) know\") and \"eidos\" (, \"species\"), a thing seen, have the same root as the word \"idea\" (), a thing ἰδείν to see. indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses. The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization. The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.\n\nKouros (\"male youth\") is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in Greece. This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of \"Apollo\". The first statues are certainly still and formal. The formality of their stance seems to be related with the Egyptian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods. The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in \"ideal forms\" that can be imagined and represented. These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of \"ideal balance and order\". His shrine in Delphi, that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: (gnōthi seautón=\"know thyself\") and (\"mēdén ágan\", \"nothing in excess\"), and (eggýa pára d'atē, \"make a pledge and mischief is nigh\").\nIn the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life. The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive. This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself. A fine example is the statue of the \"Sacred Gate Kouros\" which was found at the cemetery of Dipylon in Athens (Dipylon Kouros). The statue is the \"thing in itself\", and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the Dipylon master was named Daedalus, and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the \"New York kouros\", which is the oldest fully preserved statue of \"Kouros\" type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.\nThe animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the Homeric poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god Hephaestus (Phaistos) and the mythic Daedalus (the builder of the labyrinth) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the Minoan period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment. These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.\n\nThe earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of \"Apollo Ptoios\", Boeotia alone. The last stage in the development of the \"Kouros type\" is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo. It was found in Piraeus, the harbour of Athens. The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. It probably comes from north-eastern Peloponnesus. The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art. The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler and heavier style, restricts Ionian influence in Athens. Finally, this is the germ from which the art of Polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later.\n\nAt the beginning of the Classical period, it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions. The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment (Myron), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant Minoan element. Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances. Polykleitos in his \"Canon\" wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of Pythagoras.\nThe famous \"Apollo of Mantua\" and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm. The type is represented by neo-Attic Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of Polykleitos but more archaic. The Apollo held the \"cythara\" against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.\n\nThough the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the Minoan period, and in the beliefs of the first Greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self. Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.\n\nIn the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.\n\nThe Siphnian Treasury in Delphi was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling. The pediment shows the story of Heracles stealing Apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. Their two figures hold the centre. In the pediment of the temple of Zeus in Olympia, the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.\n\nThese representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole. While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs. In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and from a busy battlefield. The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.\n\nApollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a kithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types). The Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans, from the Renaissance through the 19th century. The marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares, made between 350 and 325 BCE.\n\nThe life-size so-called \"Adonis\" found in 1780 on the site of a \"villa suburbana\" near the Via Labicana in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from El Djem, Roman \"Thysdrus\", he is identifiable as Apollo Helios by his effulgent halo, though now even a god's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire.\n\nAnother haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse. The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great. Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.\n\nApollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature. Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a \"Hymn of Apollo\" (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinsky's \"Apollon musagète\" (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band Rush released an album with songs \"Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom\"/\"Dionysus: Bringer of Love\".\n\nIn discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable. Carl Jung's Apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.\n\nCharles Handy, in \"Gods of Management\" (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organisational culture. Apollo represents a 'role' culture where order, reason, and bureaucracy prevail.\n\nIn spaceflight, the NASA program for landing astronauts on the Moon was named Apollo.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Buell moved to New York in 1971 after signing a modeling contract with Eileen Ford, and garnered notoriety after her publicized relationship with musician Todd Rundgren from 1972 until 1979, as well as her liaisons with several rock musicians over the following four decades. She is the mother of actress Liv Tyler, whose father is Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. Buell was involved with Rundgren when she had a fling with Tyler and gave birth to Liv in 1977; she then resumed her relationship with Rundgren.\n\nIn 2001, Buell wrote an autobiography (with Victor Bockris) titled \"Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey\". The book was a \"New York Times\" bestseller. The paperback was issued in 2002.\n\nBuell was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, the daughter of Dorothea (Brown) Johnson, who founded the Protocol School of Washington, and Harold Lloyd Buell. As her father was not at home at the time of Buell's birth, her mother waited until he got back before naming her daughter. The nurses in the hospital took to calling her \"Baby Buell,\" which is where her nickname of \"Bebe\" originated. She is of German descent.\n\nBuell was discovered by modeling agency executive Eileen Ford after high school graduation at age 17, and relocated to New York City at age 18. She was \"Playboy\" magazine's Playmate of the Month for the November 1974 issue; her centerfold was photographed by Richard Fegley. In describing her early years and modeling career, Buell stated: \"[I wanted] to be a professional singer [which was why] I came to New York— yes, I was a pretty young girl, so I fell into the modeling thing, and [then] I did \"Playboy\", so then the rock stars came-a-hunting, as I like to say.\"\n\nIn 1981, Buell recorded a four-song EP on Rhino Records, produced by Rick Derringer and Ric Ocasek, with the Cars serving as her band on two tracks. The rock band the Power Station began in 1984 when her then-boyfriend John Taylor (of Duran Duran fame) pulled some famous friends together to provide backing for another of Buell's musical efforts. She also formed the band the B-Sides in 1980 but they disbanded in 1985.\n\nShe founded another band called the Gargoyles in 1985, and released a couple of singles. A few large record companies were showing interest, but they disbanded when the paternity of her daughter Liv became publicly known in 1991. She withdrew from performing for six years in the 1990s. Buell managed her daughter Liv, helping to launch her career as a successful international model and actress. She also represented actress Charis Michelsen.\n\nAfter Buell's daughter left home in 1997, Buell returned to music to record a solo effort with producer Don Fleming, released in 2000. She also performed around New York with the Bebe Buell Band and, later, with Boston musicians the Rudds and the Neighborhoods' drummer Johnny Lynch to form a new band for a few shows which also included husband Jim Wallerstein.\n\nShe released her first recording in ten years with a single \"Air Kisses for the Masses\" in May 2009 and completed recording of a full-length 12-song album, set for late Fall 2009. It can be downloaded on iTunes or Amazon MP3. Buell is playing a series of live shows in the New York City area to promote the single.\n\nIn September 2011, Buell released \"Hard Love\", an aggressive rock album influenced by grunge and glam rock. The album was produced by Bebe's husband James Wallerstein of the critically acclaimed proto-grunge band Das Damen, and Stephen DeAcutis. The 11-track record features original songs alongside covers of Gang of Four's \"I Love a Man in Uniform\" and \"Baby Baby\" by the English punk rock band the Vibrators.\n\nBuell has dated many musicians, beginning with Paul Cowsill of the Cowsills when she was 16. She has dated Mick Jagger, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Todd Rundgren, Jimmy Page, and Steven Tyler, but she rejects the label \"groupie\".\n\nFrom 1972 to 1979, Bebe Buell had a longterm, on and off, relationship with Todd Rundgren. In 1976, Buell became unexpectedly pregnant from her brief relationship with Steven Tyler. On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth to future actress/model Liv Tyler, but Buell initially named her child \"Liv Rundgren\" and claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father to protect the child from Tyler's drug addiction. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship shortly after Liv's birth, but Rundgren put his heart and soul into the \"white lie\". At age nine, Liv found out that she was Steven Tyler's biological daughter.\n\nIn 1992, Buell married for the first time. She wed sometime-musician and actor Coyote Shivers. They divorced in 1999 after a year-long separation. In 2002, she married musician Jim Wallerstein (aka Jim Walters) of Das Damen and Vacationland fame.\n\nFor his film \"Almost Famous\", music journalist and filmmaker Cameron Crowe developed the groupie character Penny Lane as a composite of a handful of girls he saw backstage in the late 1960s and early 1970s at concerts calling themselves the \"Flying Garter Girls\". One girl who went by the nickname Pennie Lane is real-life Pennie Lane Trumbull, born in Portland, Oregon, in 1954. Though they were not in the Flying Garter Girls group, various other women have been described as Crowe's inspiration, for instance Pamela Des Barres and Buell. Buell partially inspired Crowe; he named a lead singer character Jeff Bebe.\n\nBuell lived in New York and New Jersey before relocating to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2014.\n\nSolo\n\n\n\nwith the B-Sides\n\nwith the Gargoyles\n\nTwo 45 releases:\n\nCassette EP, \"Bebe Buell and the Gargoyles\": \"Vibrator\"/\"Lick it and Stick it\"/\"Take Me to Your Leader\"/\"Luv Reaction\" (1988), FISHTRAKS\n\n"}

He is known as the first printer of a book with copper engravings, and as the printer of the first books in English and French.\n\nColard Mansion was a central figure in the early printing industry in Bruges. He was active as early as 1454 as a bookseller, and was also active as a scribe, translator and contractor for manuscripts, which meant entering into contracts with the clients, and organizing and sub-contracting the elements such as scribing, decorating and binding. From 1474 until 1476 he worked together with the early English printer William Caxton, and he continued the company on his own afterwards. Caxton probably learned the art of printing from Mansion, and it was from Mansion's press that the first books printed in English (\"Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye\") and French came. He moved to the Burg, the commercial heart of Bruges at the time, in 1478. Mansion suffered heavily under the economic crisis in Bruges in the 1480s, and only one work was printed after the death of Mary of Burgundy in 1482. Nothing is known with certainty about his life after 1484, although he may have moved to Picardy.\n\nMansion sold illuminated manuscripts to the aristocracy, and luxurious incunabula to the bourgeoisie, but he was one of the first to also publish smaller and cheaper books of only twenty to thirty pages, mainly in French. Nowadays, 25 editions of incunabula by Mansion alone are known, making him the most prolific of Bruges' early printers. Only two of these are in Latin, all others are in French, many of them first editions. Customers of Mansion include Charles de Croÿ, prince of Chimay, and Marie, the widow of Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol. Mansion has been called the first printer of luxury books.\n\nHe collaborated with major manuscript illuminators, such as the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book, who were fast losing work to printing, or copyists of their work. In fact only two of his books are illustrated, the influential \"Ovide Moralisé\" with woodcuts, and a French translation of Boccaccio's \"De Casibus Virorum Illustrium\", the first book to be illustrated with engravings, some of which have been claimed to be the work of the Dresden Prayer Book Master and other identified illuminators in the circle of the Master of Anthony of Burgundy. As intaglio prints, the nine engravings had to be printed separately from the relief text and then pasted in, and only three copies are known with the engravings. More copies are known without the engravings, several of which contain illuminations instead. It has been suggested that this was Mansion's original intention (other incunabula left spaces for manual illustration), but that this hybrid product did not attract the wealthy buyers of illuminations, so the engravings were an afterthought, aimed at a less exclusive market. Mansion is also known as the translator of at least five texts from Latin to French, including \"Le dialogue des créatures\", printed by Dutch Gerard Leeu in 1482.\n\n\nIncunabula by Mansion are scattered throughout collections mainly in Western Europe. The largest such collection is in Paris, and the 16 copies of 10 different titles in the Public Library of Bruges form the second biggest collection.\n\n"}

His story is told in a popular short video by Western Sydney University, where he earned his law degree. He was named the 2017 New South Wales Australian of the Year.\n\nA member of the Dinka people, Adut was born near Malek, a small fishing village in South Sudan near White Nile River. One of eight children, he had a happy early childhood spent with his family at their banana farm.\n\nIn 1987 at the age of 6 or 7 years, Adut was taken from his mother and marched for 33 days to Ethiopia along with 30 other child conscripts. During the march, some boys died of starvation or thirst, others were shot by bandits, and others attacked by wild animals. The boys were forced to fight for the Sudan People's Liberation Army in the Second Sudanese Civil War. They were brainwashed and given daily doses of khat, a herbal stimulant drug popular in East Africa. Adut was taught to use an AK-47 assault rifle and other weapons. He witnessed many atrocities, including people dying from dehydration and a grenade explosion and children committing suicide. At 12 years of age he was shot in the testicles and back and almost bled to death.\n\nIn 1995, Adut's older half-brother, John Mac, smuggled Adut out of Sudan at night in a truck under sacks of corn. Adut spent 18 months in a refugee camp in Kenya. The United Nations granted both brothers refugee status, and in 1998 when Adut was 14, Australia granted both boys a visa.\n\nAdut reached Australia in 1998 at age 14 due to sponsorship by Christian aid workers Bob and Christine Harrison. He was part of the third family to come to Australia as Sudanese refugees. He had little education and did not know English, and initially felt isolated as a member of the only black family in Blacktown, Sydney. At 15 Adut taught himself English, in part by using \"The Wiggles\" children's television program and the Bible as examples, though Adut is an avowed atheist. He worked myriad part-time jobs including making concrete, carpet, windows and doors, catching chickens, working in a meat factory, working in a petrol station, and mowing lawns. He became an Australian citizen in 2001.\n\nIn 2001, Adut completed a TAFE course equivalent to a high school certificate. Subsequently he completed an Advanced Diploma in Accounting at TAFE. He rejected an offer to study at Macquarie University following racist remarks by Macquarie law professor Drew Fraser, instead accepting admission to Western Sydney University on a scholarship. The first in his family to earn a university degree, Adut graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, and worked for Grace Legal and then LN Legal. Along with solicitor Joseph Correy, Adut co-founded AC Law Group and is still a partner, supporting youths of Western Sydney's Sudanese community as a defence lawyer. He performs much of his work \"pro bono\".\n\nAdut founded the John Mac Foundation in honour of his half-brother, John Mac Acuek, who helped Adut escape South Sudan and died in 2014 while leading an effort to rescue South Sudanese civilians from ongoing conflict. The Foundation provides higher education scholarships to students from refugee backgrounds. Adut sponsors \"Savannah Pride\", a Blacktown basketball team.\n\nIn 2017 Adut condemned the ban on immigration to the United States ordered by US President Donald Trump. He said, \"The culture of punishing the innocent and weak countries has got to stop. It's not stopping wars; it's creating them. It's creating economic deprivation for the local people; the victims are the poor, the ones that have no skills, the refugees.\"\n\nAdut completed a Master of Laws in Criminal Prosecution at Wollongong University and has a scholarship to return to Western Sydney University for a second Master of Laws in International Governance. He ultimately aims to return to South Sudan to prosecute those responsible for the conscription of child soldiers.\n\nIn 2015 Western Sydney University produced a short video about Adut's life up to his 2012 reunion with his mother, who was still living in Adut's childhood home in South Sudan. Viewed over 2 million times on YouTube, Adut says it \"has helped others understand the horrors that see people seek asylum in safer countries\", and helped him promote the importance of education.\n\nOn 27 October 2016 Adut was awarded the 2016 Law Society of New South Wales President's Medal. Society president Gary Ulman said the award is \"testament to [Adut's] personal and professional achievements over a number of years, and to his outstanding contribution to the community of Western Sydney.\"\n\nAlso in 2016 Adut was named New South Wales Australian of the Year for 2017. The announcement was made by the state Premier Mike Baird, who said Adut \"has channelled his success into helping hundreds of people in the state's Sudanese community navigate their way through the Australian legal system.\"\n\nAn acrylic and oil on linen portrait of Adut titled \"Deng\" by artist Nick Stathopoulos won the People's Choice Award in the 2016 Archibald Prize at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\n\n"}
{"id": "52503567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52503567", "title": "Disappearance of Cheryl Grimmer", "text": "Disappearance of Cheryl Grimmer\n\nCheryl Grimmer (born 1966) was a three-year-old toddler who went missing on 12 January 1970 from a Wollongong beach, in Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia. She had been in the shower block at the beach when witnesses claim a man took her and ran off.\n\nGrimmer's disappearance has been without explanation for over 45 years. A suspect was arrested and charged in March 2017.\n\nThe family emigrated from Knowle, a suburb of Bristol, England to Australia in 1969 when Cheryl was two years old and they were living in a hostel near to the beach where she disappeared. The family was mother Carole (26), father John (24) and sons Ricki (7), Stephen (5) and Paul (4). Cheryl was the Grimmers' only daughter.\n\nOn the morning of 12 January 1970, the Grimmer family went to the beach at Fairy Meadow in Illawarra except for John Grimmer who was away working as a sapper for the Australian Army. When the weather turned at 1:30 pm, Carole Grimmer decided it was time to go home. The children all went to the shower block together whilst Carole Grimmer packed up their belongings. Ricki went back to Carole Grimmer ten minutes later saying that Cheryl was refusing to come out of the shower block. She followed Ricki back to the shower block moments later only to find that Cheryl had disappeared. There has been no trace of her since.\n\nAt the time, witnesses claimed that a man was seen holding Cheryl up to drink from a water fountain and then ran off with her wrapped up in a towel. She was also spotted being driven off in a white car.\n\nNew South Wales Police Minister Michael Gallagher said that it is entirely possible that both Cheryl and her kidnapper were dead but that someone may know the truth. He also alluded to the possibility of someone being alive today suspecting that they may be Cheryl. One reason for this is that Cheryl had a medical condition that made her belly button protrude outwards by and this would be easily identifiable if that person were alive today or if they had surgery to correct this. In 2012 a woman thought that she might be Cheryl. She submitted a DNA swab taken from her inside cheek, but this proved to not be a match for Cheryl Grimmer's DNA.\n\nHer disappearance sparked a massive manhunt and three days later, police received a note demanding $10,000 and saying that the child was unharmed. The police staged a drop for the money in Bulli, but the kidnapper never showed despite police earnestly believing the note was credible. The police disguised themselves as council workers for the ransom drop, but they fear this led to the kidnapper being spooked and that the large police operation may have also deterred the kidnapper from coming forward to claim their ransom. The case became famous in Australia and the family relocated back to England for ten years afterwards to escape the notoriety.\n\nA local man confessed to killing Cheryl, but police investigations revealed that his confession was false.\n\nIn May 2011, a coroner ruled that Cheryl had died sometime after going missing due to an undetermined cause, but Carole Grimmer stated that she believed her daughter was still alive. Both Carole and John Grimmer have since died without knowing what happened to Cheryl. Despite the coroner's ruling, police posted a $100,000 reward for information regarding Cheryl's disappearance. In 2016, a review of the evidence was carried out and all of the evidence and witness statements were computerised for the first time. The review threw up many leads and information that was not pursued thoroughly enough in 1970. Wollongong detectives and the Homicide Squad's Unsolved Homicide Team combined efforts into a new task force called 'Strike Force Wessell'.\n\nPolice announced in December 2016 that they had a credible lead on a man who was seen carrying a fair-haired child at the time of Cheryl's disappearance from the beach. Police said that he was a teenager at the time, so would be in his 60s now, and appealed for him to come forward.\n\nOn 23 March 2017, it was announced that a man had been arrested and charged with Grimmer's abduction and murder. Police stated that it is unlikely that Cheryl's body will ever be found as there has been substantial development of the once-rural area in the 47 years since the abduction.\n\nIn April 2017, NSW police stated that they were trying to trace a family who gave a witness statement on the day of the abduction. The family moved soon after to Papua New Guinea and then back to their native Nottinghamshire in England. Interpol helped to trace the witness, now 80-years old, whose testimony is expected to be crucial in the upcoming court case.\n\nIn May 2017, it was revealed that the suspect who was arrested in March 2017 had confessed to Cheryl's abduction and murder back in 1970. However, police at the time did not believe him. The accused is a 63-year-old man who was born in Britain and has been in Australia since the late 1960s. He has not been named, as he was 16-years-old at the time of the alleged offence and therefore a minor.\n\n"}

United States\". He is a member of the prominent Chamorro family that provided five of Nicaragua's past presidents.\n\nEdgar Chamorro is the son of Julio Chamorro Benard and wife Dolores \"Lola\" Coronel Urtecho, paternal grandson of Filadelfo Chamorro Bolaños and wife Bertha Benard Vivas and great-grandson of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro y Alfaro, 39th President of Nicaragua, and wife María de la Luz Bolaños Bendaña. He has six brothers and four sisters, and is the nephew of intellectual José Coronel Urtecho. In 1950, 19-year-old Chamorro began studying for the Jesuit priesthood, earning degrees from Ecuador's Catholic University, Saint Louis University, and Marquette University. Chamorro joined the faculty of the Jesuit-run University of Central America, before leaving the priesthood in 1969. He got another degree from Harvard University in 1972 and founded a public relations and marketing firm, Creative Publicity, in Managua. In 1977, Anastasio Somoza Debayle appointed him to a figurehead post as a special ambassador to the United Nations General Assembly for a year.\n\nDuring the Sandinista Revolution, Chamorro sympathized with the rebels, at one point hiding Sergio Ramírez from the National Guard. But as the civil war's climax brought fierce fighting to the capital itself, fears for his family's safety led him to leave for Miami, Florida on June 17, 1979. Somoza fell a month later, but after visiting Nicaragua in September, Chamorro decided to remain in Miami.\n\nBy late 1979, Chamorro had become involved in the anti-Sandinista activities of the Miami exile community. He joined the Nicaraguan Democratic Union (UDN), formed the next year by José Francisco Cardenal, which merged into the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) in August 1981. He served on the FDN's political executive committee, which decided to replace Cardenal with a new political directorate. Chamorro was tapped to be a member of the directorate, unveiled at a December 8, 1982 press conference. With his public relations experience, he took on a spokesman role for the FDN, and based himself in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to liaison with journalists covering the war. Chamorro claimed that the CIA prepped him before press conferences and told him to deny that the group had received any funding from the US government.\n\nChamorro was miffed when the FDN directorate, at the CIA's prompting, appointed Adolfo Calero as its president in October 1983. His not-so-private grumblings that his Chamorro lineage was more illustrious than Calero's did not help their deteriorating relations. Chamorro was forced out in November 1984, in the fallout from the furor over the CIA's \"Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare\", labeled by the press a \"murder manual.\" He turned against the rebel movement, even submitting an affidavit for the Sandinista government before the International Court of Justice in \"Nicaragua v. United States\".\n\nChamorro is author of \"Packaging the Contras: A Case of C.I.A. Disinformation\" (1987). He has served as a teacher of Spanish, Latin and Latin American Studies at Bard College at Simon's Rock since 1990 (full-time to 2003), and the John Dewey Academy in Great Barrington, Massachusetts since 2005.\n"}

Even her real name has been referred to differently at times, such as Panchita, Francisca, Pancheta, or Francita, and her surname as Alevesco, Alvárez, or Alavez.\n\nDuring the Texas Revolution, she did travel to Texas in 1836, as a companion of Captain Telesforo Alavez, who had sailed to Texas from Matamoros, Mexico to El Cópano port at Copano Bay, Texas.\n\nAt El Cópano, she combined her compassion for humanity with her strong willed personality to influence important Mexican officials to treat the Texian prisoners humanely. When 80 soldiers of Major William Parsons Miller and the Nashville Battalion were captured by Urrea's soldiers, she influenced the Mexican soldiers to untie the men's hands and to give them something to eat.\n\nIn La Bahia (Goliad), due to the intervention of this Angel of Goliad and the courageous effort of Colonel Francisco Garay, 20 more men were held and spared as doctors, interpreters, or workers. Francita entered the presidio the night before the massacre, bringing several men out with her and hiding them until after the Goliad Massacre. She also made sure the 80 men from Miller's Natchez group were not executed.\n\nIn Victoria, where her husband was left in charge, she saw to it that the 26 Texian boat builders and workers there would be released and not executed.\n\nAfter the defeat of Santa Anna, Francita returned with Captain Alavez to Matamoros. At the prison in Matamoros, she continued to support the Texians imprisoned there. When Captain Alavez left for Mexico City, Francita went with him. But their relationship soon ended. She then left Mexico City and returned to Matamoros. While broke and down on her luck, she was befriended by Texians who knew of her humanitarian acts.

Potenza joined the New York Police Department (NYPD) following the war, serving as a beat cop in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn in the 62nd Precinct for 20 years.

He returned to New York City to take a security position at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.\n\nPotenza had worked in security for more than ten years in New York City and Las Vegas when his nephew, comedian Jimmy Kimmel, asked him to join his late-night show, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", as a regular in 2003.

He is credited as being the first spirit photographer in Britain.\n\nAccording to Joseph McCabe, Hudson's photographs were exposed as fraudulent in 1872 by a fellow spiritualist, William Henry Harrison. Hudson was also exposed by another investigator. The psychical researcher Simeon Edmunds wrote that \"John Beattie, a professional photographer of note, demonstrated conclusively that his spirits were faked by a simple process of double exposure.\"\n\nIn 1874, Alfred Russel Wallace visited Hudson and a photograph of him with his deceased mother was produced. Wallace declared the photograph genuine, declaring \"I see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being, acquainted with my mother's various aspects during life, produced these recognisable impressions on the plate.\"\n\nMagic Historian Milbourne Christopher has written:\n\nHudson introduced spirit photography to Britain in 1872. He varied his methods through the years. Though frequently caught practicing deception, he was never arrested. Hudson at one time used a trick camera, made by a craftsman who sold conjuring apparatus. Harry Price described how the camera worked in his book, \"Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter\", published in London in 1936. When the plate slide was inserted, this action brought the paper positive of the \"ghost\" up against the sensitive plate. When the shutter bulb was pressed, this image and the picture of the sitter were captured on the plate. Thus a single exposure on this plate carried both images.\n\nHudson was known to dress up as spirits or use double exposure to produce his spirit photography. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell noted that Hudson's photographs were fraudulent.

Dugas was code-named as \"patient O\" (pronounced \"oh\", and standing for \"Out-of-California\"); misconstruing of the letter \"O\" as 0 (zero) led to the origin of the term \"patient zero.\" The extent to which HIV/AIDS was known about in the early 1980s, how it was spread, or when Dugas was diagnosed are disputed.\nDugas worked as a flight attendant for Air Canada and died in Quebec City in March 1984 as a result of kidney failure caused by AIDS-related infections.\n\nA study published in \"The American Journal of Medicine\" in 1984 traced many early HIV infections to an unnamed infected gay male flight attendant. Initially, however, the CDC researcher, who was studying cases in Los Angeles, California, referred to Dugas not as \"patient zero\", but as \"patient O\", the letter \"O\" standing for \"outside California\".\n\nDugas is featured prominently in Randy Shilts's book \"And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic\" (1987), which documents the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. Shilts portrays Dugas as having almost sociopathic behavior by allegedly intentionally infecting, or at least recklessly endangering, others with the virus. Dugas is described as being a charming, handsome sexual athlete who, according to his own estimation, averaged hundreds of sex partners per year. He claimed to have had over 2,500 sexual partners across North America since becoming sexually active in 1972. In David France's 2016 book \"How to Survive a Plague\", Shilts's editor expressed his regret for having \"made a conscious decision to vilify Dugas in the book and publicity campaign in order to spur sales.\"\n\nGenetic analysis historically provided some support for the Patient Zero theory, in which Dugas was believed to be part of a cluster of homosexual men who traveled frequently, were extremely sexually active, and died of AIDS at a very early stage in the epidemic.\n\nA number of authorities have since voiced reservations about the implications of the CDC's Patient Zero study and characterizations of Dugas as being responsible for bringing HIV to cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the Patient Zero study, the average length of time between sexual contact and the onset of symptoms was months. While Shilts's book does not make such an allegation, the rumor that Dugas was the principal disseminator of the virus became widespread. In 1988, Andrew R. Moss published an opposing view in \"The New York Review of Books\".\n\nIn 2016, a group of researchers led by evolutionary biologist Dr. Michael Worobey conducted a genetic study that looked at blood samples taken from gay and bisexual men in 1978 and 1979 as part of a hepatitis B study, and based on the results of the data, concluded that Dugas was not the source of the virus in the U.S. \"On the family tree of the virus, Dugas fell in the middle, not at the beginning.\" \"Beliefs about Patient Zero,\" Worobey concludes, \"are unsupported by scientific data.\" Worobey's paper, published in \"Nature\" in October 2016, finds \"neither biological nor historical evidence that he was the primary case in the US or for subtype B as a whole.\"\n\nA study by historian Richard McKay of Cambridge and others identified several causes for the Patient Zero myth. During early CDC analysis of cases in California, patient 057 (Dugas) was nicknamed patient \"O\" for \"outside the area\", but this was interpreted by others as Patient Zero. Dugas was particularly helpful in tracing his network of partners, providing names and addresses for many of them, which was further expanded because others remembered his distinctive name. Although many of the patients analyzed reported in excess of 1000 sexual partners, most remembered \"only a handful\" of names, making their contacts to other cases more difficult to trace.\n\nDr. Robert M. Grant, an AIDS researcher at the University of California, has stated: \"No one wants to be the Patient Zero of their village. But this may be helpful because it says, ‘Just because you are the first to be diagnosed doesn’t mean you started the epidemic.’ \"\n\n\n"}

A native of St. Landry Parish in South Louisiana, he maintained his legal office for many years in Opelousas.\n\nIn his last year in office, Dupré, by then an elderly deaf man, spoke out against the Long intra-party challenger, Dudley LeBlanc of Abbeville through the Long newspaper, the \"Louisiana Progress\".\n\nDupré was born into an established French-American family, the son of Lucius Jacques Dupré (1822–1869) and the former Caroline Victoire Vanhille (1826–1896). His great-grandfather, Jacques Dupré, was a pioneer of St. Landry Parish who served as a National Republican governor of Louisiana from 1830 to 1831 and in the Louisiana State Senate during the 1830s and 1840s. Gilbert was only ten when his father, Lucius, who was a law graduate of the University of Virginia and a member of the former Confederate Congress, died. There was no money for Gilbert's education; so he was self-educated in the law while he worked first in the office of the St. Landry Parish clerk of court. He was admitted to the bar in 1880 and established his law office in Opelousas. In 1887, Dupré was a member of the Louisiana state militia and was on active duty at the time of a riot in Morgan City in St. Mary Parish. He was a member of the Masonic lodge, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nFrom 1888 to 1992 and again from 1913, to fill the seat vacated by A. H. Garland, who left the state, until 1932, Dupré was a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. He served as a state district court judge by election from 1896 to 1900 and by appointment in 1914. He was elected judge in 1916, 1920, and 1924, while he also served in the part-time legislative post. Such dual office-holding is no longer permitted. Judge Dupré, as he was long known, was a member of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention of 1921. In his second stint in the legislature, his successors included his son-in-law, Felix Octave Pavy, a prominent St. Landry Parish physician and an uncle by marriage of Dr. Carl Weiss, the assassin of U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long, Jr.\n\nThe editor of the former \"New Orleans Item\" referred to Representative Dupré's steadfast opposition to tax increases:<br>\nThere was a statesman in Tennessee who attributed his popularity to the fact that he had never voted for a tax or against an appropriation. We might almost say of Judge Dupré that we do not recall his ever having voted for a tax increase, salary increase, or for an increased appropriation.\nThe position of the twelfth man in opposition to eleven stubborn jurors is one which the judge is not afraid to take in a world which loves to have unanimous action and where kickers are generally made uncomfortable.\n\nIn 1881, Dupré married Julia B. Estilette (1860–1944) of Opelousas, the daughter of his law partner, E. D. Estilette. She was born in New Haven, Connecticut, where her father was attending Yale University. E. D. Estilette was a judge and in 1876 the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives. The couple had four children, including twin daughters, a son, and a third daughter. He was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. Dupré outlived his wife by two years. They are interred along with other family members at the Myrtle Grove Cemetery in Opelousas.\n\nTo retaliate against Dupré, Long had a hole drilled in the roof directly above Dupre's office in the Old Louisiana State Capitol to punish Dupré for the lawmaker's opposition to a new capitol building. When he demanded that Governor Huey Long repair the problem at once, Long said that he would do so only if Dupré would vote for the planned new Louisiana State Capitol building, to be built in skyscraper format. When Dupré refused to commit his vote, Long told him, \"Die, damn you, in the faith!\"\nLong then noted that Dupré \"was much amused and almost came over.\"\n"}

{"id": "294411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294411", "title": "John E. Mack", "text": "John E. Mack\n\nProfessor John Edward Mack M.D. (October 4, 1929 – September 27, 2004) was an American psychiatrist, writer, and professor and department head at Harvard Medical School. In 1976, Mack won the Pulitzer Prize for his book \"A Prince of Our Disorder\" on T.E. Lawrence. \n\nMack's clinical expertise at Harvard was in child psychology, adolescent psychology, and the psychology of religion. He was also known as a leading researcher on the psychology of teenage suicide and drug addiction, and he later became a researcher in the psychology of alien abduction experiences. \nMack was born in New York City, to an academic, German Jewish family. His father, the historian Edward Clarence Mack (1904-1973), was a professor at CUNY, while his mother Eleanor Liebmann Mack (1905-1930) died while John was an infant. After his mother died, his father remarried the economist Ruth P. Mack, through which he had a half-sister, Mary Lee Ingbar, a pioneer of computer analysis who became a professor at Dartmouth College and University of Massachusetts Medical School. Growing up, his father would read the Bible to John and his sister, but as a work of culture or literature. Mack graduated from the Horace Mann-Lincoln School in 1947 and Phi Beta Kappa from Oberlin in 1951, and received his medical doctorate degree \"cum laude\" from Harvard Medical School in 1955. Mack subsequently interned at the Massachusetts General Hospital and trained as a psychiatrist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. \n\nIn 1959, Mack joined the US Air Force, serving as a medic in Japan, where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1961 he returned from military service in Japan, continuing at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute receiving certification in child and adult psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. From 1964 Mack returned to Harvard Medical School, becoming a full professor at Harvard in 1972, and then becoming Head of the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, where he continued to work until his death. \n\nMack published over 150 scientific articles and eleven books in his career. As department head at Harvard Medical School, he worked primarily in the field of child and adolescent psychology. He worked on treating suicidal patients, and published research on heroin addiction. The dominant theme of his life's work at Harvard had been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of \"world view\" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in \"A Prince of Our Disorder\", his biographical study of the life of British officer T. E. Lawrence, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1977.\n\nIn the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the Cold War, including former United States President Jimmy Carter and the \"father of the hydrogen bomb\", Edward Teller. \n\nMack, together with luminaries such as Carl Sagan and other Physicians for Social Responsibility (the United States affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the Nevada Test Site in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus psychological study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent alien encounter experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures, R. Leo Sprinkle perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s. Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.\n\nHe initially suspected that such persons were suffering from mental illness, but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend Thomas Kuhn, who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and \"either/or\" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews. Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern.\n\nMack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that \"On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go.\" In a 1994 interview, Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed \"inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value\". Mack replied by saying \"Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't have a way to account for them.\" Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, \"I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry.\"\n\nMack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.\n\nHis interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature — yet nonetheless real — set him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as Budd Hopkins, who advocated the physical reality of aliens.\n\nHis later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, \"Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters\" (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern world-views as it was the culmination of his work with the \"experiencers\" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.\n\nIn May 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, Daniel C. Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book \"Abduction\"). Angela Hind wrote, \"It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation.\"\n\nThe committee chairman was Arnold \"Budd\" Relman, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of \"The New England Journal of Medicine\". According to Daniel P. Sheehan, one of Mack's attorneys, the committee's draft report suggested that \"To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a ‘close encounter’ with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real ... is professionally irresponsible.”\n\nUpon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack's defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law Alan Dershowitz) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had \"reaffirmed Dr. Mack's academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment,\" concluding \"Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine.\" (Mack was censured in the committee's report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee's assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel Sheehan, (of the Pentagon Papers case) and the support of Laurance Rockefeller, who also funded Mack's non-profit organization for four consecutive years at $250,000 per year.\n\nOn Monday, September 27, 2004 while in London to lecture at a T. E. Lawrence Society-sponsored conference, Mack was killed by a drunken driver heading west on Totteridge Lane. He was walking home alone, after a dinner with friends, when he was struck at 11:25 p.m. near the junction of Totteridge Lane and Longland Drive. He lost consciousness at the scene of the accident and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver, Raymond Czechowski, an IT manager, was arrested at the scene, and later entered a plea of guilty by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mack's family requested leniency for the suspect Czechowski in a letter to the Wood Green Crown Court. \"Although this was a tragic event for our family,\" the letter reads, \"we feel [the accused's] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision.\" The driver, Ray Czechowski served 6 months and was disqualified from driving for 3 years.\n\nHe wrote the following books:\n\nCollaborations:\n\nHe was editor or co-editor of:\n\nUnpublished:\n\nHe also wrote the foreword to \"Paths Beyond Ego: The Transpersonal Vision\" (1993), the introductions to \"The PK Man: A True Story of Mind Over Matter\" (2000) by Jeffrey Mishlove and \"Secret Life\" (1992) by David M. Jacobs, and he contributed chapters to several books including \"The Long Darkness: Psychological and Moral Perspectives on Nuclear Winter\" (1986), \"The Psychology of Terrorism Vol. 1: A Public Understanding\" (2002), and \"The Psychospiritual Clinician's Handbook\" (2005).\n\n\n"}

It has the head of a human, body of a lion and a tail of venomous spines similar to porcupine quills, while other depictions have it with the tail of a scorpion. There are some accounts that the spines can be shot like arrows, thus making the manticore a lethal predator. It eats its victims whole, using its triple rows of teeth, and leaves no bones behind.\n\nThe mantyger is a creature of medieval invention, having the body of a heraldic tiger with mane, and the head of an old man, the tusks of a boar and with long spiral horns. Some heraldic authorities make the horns more like those of an ox, and the hands and feet like a monkey's.\n\nThe Manticore myth was of Persian origin, where its name was \"man-eater\" (from early Middle Persian مارتیا \"mardya\" \"man\" (as in human) and خوار \"khowr-\" \"to eat\"). The English term \"manticore\" was borrowed from Latin \"mantichora\", itself derived from the Greek rendering of the Persian name, , \"martichora\". It passed into European folklore first through a remark by Ctesias, a Greek physician at the Persian court of King Artaxerxes II in the fourth century BC, in his book \"Indica\" (\"India\"), which circulated among Greek writers on natural history but has survived only in fragments, or references by those other writers. The Romanised Greek Pausanias, in his \"Description of Greece\", recalled strange animals he had seen at Rome and commented,\n\nPliny the Elder did not share Pausanias' skepticism. He followed Aristotle's natural history by including the \"martichoras\" – mistranscribed as \"manticorus\" in his copy of Aristotle – among his descriptions of animals in \"Naturalis Historia\" 8:30, c. 77 AD.\n\nLater, in \"The Life of Apollonius of Tyana\" Greek writer Flavius Philostratus (c. 170–247) wrote:\n\nPliny's book was widely enjoyed and uncritically believed through the European Middle Ages, during which the manticore was sometimes described or illustrated in bestiaries. Through false etymology, it was sometimes assumed that the name was an amalgamation of \"man\" and \"tiger\"; although other sources regarded the \"mantyger\" as a different creature entirely (the mantyger having monkey-like feet, being apparently inspired by the baboon; and also sometimes being represented with either tusks or short horns). There was further confusion as to whether the manticore should be identified with or distinguished from the \"satyral\" and the lampago.\n\nDante Alighieri, in his \"Inferno\", depicted the mythical creature Geryon as a manticore, following Pliny's description.\n\nThe manticore or mantyger first appeared in English heraldry in c.1470, as a badge of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings; and in the 16th century it was used as a badge by Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex, and by Sir Anthony Babyngton. Randle Holme in 1688 described the manticore (which he regarded as distinct from the mantyger) as having\n\nThe heraldic manticore influenced some Mannerist representations of the sin of Fraud, conceived as a monstrous chimera with a beautiful woman's face – for example, in Bronzino's allegory, \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\" (National Gallery, London), and more commonly in the decorative schemes called \"grotteschi\". From here it passed by way of Cesare Ripa's \"Iconologia\" into the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French conception of a sphinx.\n\nGerald Brenan linked the manticore to the \"mantequero\", a monster feeding on human fat in Andalusian folklore.\n\nThe manticore has been mentioned in \"Harry Potter\" novels and in the book \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\". However, it was introduced as a Greek monster by mistake.\n\nIn Emerson Lake and Palmer's 18 minute album, Tarkus, the 5th piece, Manticore, tells a tell of an armadillo who wants to conquer Earth and go through many trials, and in this piece, it is battling a Manticore.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1165704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1165704", "title": "Mark of Cornwall", "text": "Mark of Cornwall\n\nMark of Cornwall (Latin Marcus, Cornish Margh, Welsh March, Breton Marc'h) was a king of Kernow (Cornwall) in the early 6th century. He is most famous for his appearance in Arthurian legend as the uncle of Tristan and husband of Iseult, who engage in a secret affair.\n\nMark sent Tristan as his proxy to fetch his young bride, the Princess Iseult, from Ireland. Tristan and Iseult fall in love, and, with the help of a magic potion, proceed to have one of the stormiest love affairs in medieval literature. Mark suspects the affair and eventually his suspicions are confirmed. In some versions, he sends for Tristan to be hanged, and banishes Iseult to a leper colony. Tristan escapes the hanging and rescues Mark's bride from her confinement, later to be discovered by Mark. Mark eventually forgives them, with Iseult returning to Mark and Tristan leaving the country.\n\nThe story is cyclical with Mark suspecting Tristan and Iseult of adultery and then believing they were innocent. This happened again and again in the story. In the Beroul version, Tristan and Iseult are never in grave danger due to the narrator's declaration that he himself and God were on their side. King Mark, in the role of husband, is not portrayed as idealistic as other kings in Arthurian literature who were only portrayed in the role of king and not the personal role of husband.\n\nIn the \"Prose Tristan\", Mark's character deteriorates from a sympathetic cuckold to a downright villain. He rapes his niece and then murders her when she produces his son, Meraugis. He murders his brother Baldwin as well. In earlier versions of the story, Tristan dies in Brittany, far away from Mark; but in the \"Prose Tristan\", Mark stabs Tristan while he plays the harp under a tree for Iseult. Though this version of Mark's character was popular in other medieval works, including the \"Romance of Palamedes\" and Sir Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", modern versions of the Tristan and Iseult legend tend to take their inspiration from the older poetic material, and Mark becomes a sympathetic character once again. In these legends, Mark is usually seen as ruling Cornwall from Tintagel Castle.\n\nMarie de France's Breton lai \"Chevrefoil\" (titled sometimes as \"The Lay of the Honeysuckle\") tells a partial story from the Tristan and Iseult tale. The lai begins with an explanation that Mark was enraged with Tristan's affair with his wife, and thus banished him from Cornwall. Tristan spends a year in his own land of South Wales, pining away for Isoude. Eventually, his sorrow grew so great that he went against Mark's order and hid in the woods of Cornwall, taking shelter with villagers only at night. Eventually Tristan comes to hear that Mark plans to hold a feast for Pentecost, and that Isoude would be riding through the forest to attend. He finds the path the queen is most likely to take, and lays on it a hazel stick he stripped the bark off of and carved his name into. Isoude recognizes the sign and stops her party to rest, sneaking away with her maid Brangwaine to see Tristan. During this illicit meeting, Isoude helps Tristan to construct a plan to win back the favor of King Mark, which Tristan resolves to do as soon as the two part. Marie de France ends the poem by telling the reader that the lai Tristan composed was called \"Goatleaf\" in English or \"Chèvrefeuille\" in French, and that the very lai he composed was the one the reader just finished.\n\nMark has become associated with a Celtic variant of the story of Midas and his donkey ears from Greek mythology, due to a pun on \"marc\" which is a Celtic word for \"horse\". The episode already occurs in \"Tristan\" by the 12th century French poet Béroul, where the dwarf divulges the secret that \"Mark has horse's ears\" addressing a hawthorn tree, in the presence of three lords.\n\nThere is a Breton legend which appeared in print in 1794, in which March was initially the king of Cornouaille, France, seated at Ploumarch (Portzmarch). The king kills every barber who knows the secret about his ears, except one, who speaks the secret into the sand. (or wind). Reeds subsequently grow from that spot, and the plants are harvested to make into reeds for the oboe (or simply make pipes). When the instruments are played, it sounds to the audience as if the music is saying the king has horse's ears. John Rhys recorded a Welsh tale that differs little from the simpler Breton version.\n\nAn embellished version collected by (1905) blends the legend of Ys, with the premise that Marc was condemned by Gradlon's daughter (or Dahut). March tried to hunt her when she was assuming the guise of a doe and had his ears exchanged with those of his prized horse .\n\nKnown as \"The Tristan Stone\", or \"The Longstone\" (, meaning \"long stone\"), is a 2.7 m tall granite pillar near Fowey, Cornwall, originally situated at Castle Dore. The stone has a mid-6th-century two line inscription which has been interpreted as reading DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT CVNOWORI FILIV'S (\"Drustan lies here, of Cunomorus the son\"). A now missing third line was described by the 16th century antiquarian John Leland as reading CVM DOMINA OUSILLA (\"with the lady Ousilla\"). Ousilla is a Latinisation of the Cornish female name Eselt, otherwise known as Isolde. The disappearance of this third line may be as a result of the stone being moved several times.\n\nIn Wrmonoc of Landévennec's \"Life of St. Pol de Leon\", he refers to a \"King Marc whose other name is Quonomorus.\" Also rendered Cunomorus, this name means literally the 'Hound-of-the-sea'. An inscription on a 6th-century gravestone near the Cornish town of Fowey memorializes (in Latin) a certain \"Drustanus son of Cunomorus\" and it has been conjectured that this is the \"Tristan son of Mark (alias 'Quonomorus')\" of legend. There is a monument believed by some to refer to Tristan (\"Drustanus\") at .\n\nHowever, in most versions of the story, Mark is Tristan's uncle. His sister is Tristan's mother, Blancheflor alias Elizabeth/Isabelle, or, in some later versions, he is related to Tristan's father, Meliadus. Some identify King Mark with King Conomor of Dumnonia. However, it is also thought that Wrmonoc may have made a mistake with his recorded alias. In Old Welsh records, Mark is recorded as \"March son of Meirchion\" and is variously associated with North Wales, South Wales or South-West Scotland. The stone led to Mark's association with Castle Dore.\n\nKing Mark takes on a much more gruesome role in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poetry cycle \"Idylls of the King\". While Arthur and many of his knights are away taking on the court of the Red Knight, Lancelot is called upon to judge \"The Tournament of the Dead Innocence.\" The tournament quickly becomes a mockery, full of insults and broken rules. Tristram (that is, Tristan) is the winner of the tournament, winning all of the rubies from the necklace. Tristram then breaks tradition in presenting the rubies to a woman present, saying instead \"This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.\" This enrages the crowd, with many saying that \"All courtesy is dead,\" and \"The glory of our Round Table is no more.\" Tristram, who in this piece married Isolt of the White Hands, carries his winnings instead to Mark's wife Queen Isolt, who is upset that Tristram married another woman. The two mock each other for a brief period before Tristram at last puts the necklace about Isolt's neck, and leans down to kiss her. Just as his lips touch her, in an uncharacteristically violent gesture, Mark makes his appearance, rising up behind Tristram and cleaving him through the brain.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a result of her anti-corruption work, she was murdered in her own home.\n\nGarcia-Esperat's career in journalism began accidentally: in the early 1990s, she was an analytical chemist for the Department of Agriculture, when she discovered that her laboratory was not receiving the funding it had been allocated. Inspired by the example of her first husband, Severino Arcones, a journalist who was murdered in 1989, Garcia-Esperat began her public activities. She also spent two years in the witness protection program due to her ombudsman discoveries.\n\nHer case is significant, as it is the first of the 56 murders of Filipino journalists since 1986 for which the people ultimately responsible were identified, in addition to the people directly involved. Esperat, as former employee of the Department of Agriculture in Central Mindanao (DA-12) and Midland Review, Tacurong City columnist, exposed the alleged Jocelyn \"Jocjoc\" Bolante fertilizer funds scam, in which President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was implicated.\n\nTwo weeks after the killing, Randy Grecia (one of the lookouts) surrendered to police, and subsequently pleaded guilty. Grecia and his three accomplices (Estanislao Bismanos and Gerry Cabayag, who likewise pleaded guilty, and Rowie Barua, who has become a State Witness) have testified that they were hired by two officials in the Philippines Department of Agriculture of Central Mindanao. Murder charges were filed, but later dismissed.\n\nThe Esperat family lawyer, Nena Santos, told the Manila Standard that the dismissal of charges was \"highly questionable and suspicious,\" and that it was a \"miscarriage of justice.\"\nThe case was re-filed.\nThe Cebu court convicted and meted out life imprisonment to Randy Garcia, Gerry Cabayag and Estanislao Bismanos who admitted they were hired for P120,000 to kill Esperat.\n\nSince then, the Department of Justice (DOJ) ordered the reopening of the investigation against alleged masterminds Montaner and Sabay, respectively, of the Department of Agriculture (DA) who were earlier excluded from the killing of Esperat by the Regional Trial Court in Tacurong City.\n\nEsperat's sister, Valmie Garcia Mariveles, who re-filed the charges against Montañer and Sabay, gathered more evidence. Accordingly, on September 28, 2008, Cebu City RTC Branch 7 Judge Simeon Dumdum approved the withdrawal of charges at the Cebu City Court for filing of murder case, instead against the alleged 2 masterminds before the Tacurong City RTC. Also, on October 20, 2008, the Department of Justice (Philippines) refiled the murder charges, in Tacurong City against Osmeña Montañer and Estrella Sabay, DA-12 finance officer and accountant, respectively, as masterminds. Meanwhile, the New York Committee to Protect Journalists welcomed the issuance of arrest warrants by Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat Regional Trial Court Judge Melanio S. Guerrero of Branch 20 against the 2 accused, amid the case hearing on October 27, 2008. Tacurong RTC Judge Melanio Guerrero ordered the 2 accused to file a response within 10 days. The 2 DA officials, however, filed a motion to dismiss or to quash the case.\n\n\n"}

Initially he was a cup-bearer of Mieszko II and the governor of Masovia. However, an internal crisis and a pagan reaction led to the exile of Mieszko and rule of Bezprym. This weakened the Piast overlordship over Masovia. Initially, Mieszko's successor, Casimir I, did not have enough power to reunite the country and the region succumbed into chaos. The pagan reaction in Masovia was particularly strong and it is assumed that Miecław, having achieved delegated authority in Masovia under Mieszko, simply took advantage of the difficult situation to increase his rights or become independent.\nHowever, Casimir I in 1039 was supported by Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor against the Bohemians and soon afterwards he also concluded an alliance with Kievan Rus. This allowed him to gather enough forces to subdue Miecław. In 1047 he was attacked by the joint forces of Casimir I and Yaroslav I the Wise and was probably killed in a battle on the banks of Vistula.\n"}
{"id": "24872946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24872946", "title": "Moingona", "text": "Moingona\n\nThe historic Miami-Illinois people who are today referred to as the Moingona or Moingwena were close allies of or perhaps part of the Peoria. They were assimilated by that tribe and lost their separate identity about 1700. The name \"Moingona\" was probably the basis for the name of the City of Des Moines, the Des Moines River, and Des Moines County, Iowa.\n\nJacques Marquette documented in 1672 that the \"Peolualen\" (the modern Peoria). and the \"mengakonkia\" (Moingona) were among the \"Ilinoue\" (Illinois) tribes who all \"speak the same language.\"\nOther names for them mentioned in 1672-73 records were \"Mengakoukia,\" and \"Mangekekis.\"\n\nIn 1673 Marquette and Louis Jolliet left their canoes and followed a beaten path away from the river out onto the prairie to three Illinois villages within about a mile and a half of each other. Marquette identified only one of the villages at the time, the \"peouarea,\" but a later map apparently by him identified another as the \"Moingwena.\" He said of the 1673 meeting that there was \"some difference in their language,\" but that \"we easily understood each other.\"\n\nFather Jacques Gravier reports helping the close allies \"Peouaroua and Mouingoueña\" deal with a common adversary in 1700.\n\nPierre François Xavier de Charlevoix, a missionary who explored the region in 1721, recorded that \"le \"Moingona\"\" was \"an immense and magnificent Prairie, all covered with Beef and other Hoofed Animals.\" He italicized the term to indicate it was a geographical term and noted that \"one of the tribes bears that name.\" Charlevoix was a professor or belles lettres, and his spelling has come to be a preferred spelling in general and scholarly discussions.\n\nThe meaning of \"Moingona\" has been debated; historians have espoused conflicting definitions of the term, ranging from \"People by the Portage\" to \"Clan of the Loon\" and, more controversially, \"Excrement-Faced\".\n\nHistoric accounts suggest that Moingona was a term referring to people who lived by, or were encountered near, the portage around the Des Moines Rapids. The noted cartographer Joseph Nicollet supported this interpretation, as did the Algonquian linguist Henry Schoolcraft. Schoolcraft and Nicollet's report says that \"Moingona\"\n\nAn alternative interpretation is that Moingona is derived from the Algonquian clan name \"Loon\"; the Miami Indian term for loon is \"maankwa\", and many Algonquian villages took their names from tribal clans.\nA controversial theory is that the root of the expression means \"filth\" or \"excrement,\" and the expression means \"excrement face.\"\nIn this theory, the name \"Moingona\", or, especially in its older French spelling, \"Moinguena\", is from Illinois \"mooyiinkweena\" \"one who has shit on his face\". This etymology is supported by Gravier's word \"m8ing8eta\", which he translates as \"visage plein d'ordure, metaphor sale, vilain. injure\". This verb, phonetically \"mooyiinkweeta\", morphologically consists of \"mooy\"- \"shit\", -\"iinkwee\"- \"face\", and the third person singular intransitive suffix -\"ta\", for a meaning \"he who has shit on his face\". The form \"Moinguena\", phonetically \"mooyiinkweena\", is the same verb but with the independent indefinite subject ending -\"na\", for a more precise meaning \"one who has shit on his face\". The spelling \"Moinguena\" is exactly how the French spelling of the time would render the Illinois verb \"mooyiinkweena\". Perhaps this name arose as an insult given to the Moinguena by some neighboring tribe, as thus it is not known what the Moinguena called themselves.\nThis scenario is rejected by the historian Jim Fay:\n\"There is no historical record that \"shit-faced\" was ever expressed or implied in the vernacular usage of the term. There is very substantial evidence to the contrary by probably the most knowledgeable Algonquian linguists who ever lived. Missionaries who understood the language repeatedly used the term, not as a dirty metaphor or ugly insult, but as a very respectful name used in very cordial interactions with the people to whom it referred.\"\n\n"}

Agents under non-official cover do not have this \"safety net\", and if captured and charged as spies are subject to severe criminal punishments, up to and including execution. Agents under non-official cover are also usually trained to deny any connection with their government, thus preserving plausible deniability, but also denying them any hope of diplomatic legal assistance - or official acknowledgment of their service. Such agents or operatives may be referred to as a \"NOC\" (pronounced ). or as \"illegals\" (see Clandestine HUMINT operational techniques). Sometimes, entire front companies or strawman entities are established in order to provide false identities for agents.\n\nAn agent sent to spy on a foreign country might, for instance, work as a businessperson, a worker for a non-profit organization (such as a humanitarian group), or an academic. For example, the CIA's Ishmael Jones spent nearly two decades as a NOC.\n\nMany of the agents memorialized without names or dates of service on the CIA Memorial Wall are assumed to have been killed or executed in a foreign country while serving as NOC agents. In nations with established and well-developed spy agencies, the majority of captured non-native NOC agents have, however, historically been repatriated through prisoner exchanges for other captured NOCs as a form of gentlemen's agreement.\n\nSome countries have regulations regarding the use of non-official cover: the CIA, for example, has at times been prohibited from disguising agents as members of certain aid organizations, or as members of the clergy.\n\nThe degree of sophistication put into non-official cover stories varies considerably. Sometimes, an agent will simply be appointed to a position in a well-established company which can provide the appropriate opportunities. Other times, entire front companies can be established in order to provide false identities for agents.\n\nExamples include Air America, used by the CIA during the Vietnam War, and Brewster Jennings & Associates, used by the CIA in WMD investigations and made public as a result of the Plame affair.\n\nThe journalist Udo Ulfkotte made a statement, referring to his past career at the German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", that he worked as a NOC for the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nFormer MI6 officer \"Nicholas Anderson\" wrote an account of his service in a fictionalized autobiography (as per British law) entitled \"NOC: Non-Official Cover: British Secret Operations\", and two sequels: \"NOC Twice: More UK Non-Official Cover Operations\" and \"NOC Three Times: Knock-On Effect (Last of the Trilogy)\".\n\nMichael Ross, a former Mossad officer, operated as a Mossad NOC or \"combatant\" as described in his memoir, \"The Volunteer: The Incredible True Story of an Israeli Spy on the Trail of International Terrorists\" (Skyhorse Publishing, September 2007, ).\n\nFictional examples include Chuck Barris who made a satirical claim to have been a NOC with 33 kills in his book and movie \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\". Other examples are featured in the books \"Debt of Honor\", Ted Bell's \"Pirate\", and \"The Eleventh Commandment\"; in the movies \"\", \"Spy Game\", \"The Bourne Identity\", \"Safe House\", and \"The Recruit\"; and the TV shows \"The Americans\", \"Burn Notice\", \"Spooks\", \"Covert Affairs\" and \"Patriot\".\n\n"}

She is best remembered as a producer of the original production of \"Trial by Jury\" by Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\nDolaro was born in London. Her father was the violinist and conductor Benjamin Simmonds, and her mother was Julia (née Lewis). Dolaro received early music lessons from her father's colleagues, and she attended the Paris Conservatory as a teenager to continue her musical studies. In 1865, at the age of sixteen, she married Isaac Dolaro Belasco, an Italian Jew of Spanish descent, in Upper Kennington, England. By 1870, she had adopted Dolaro as her stage name.\nDolaro made her stage debut at the Lyceum Theatre, in the role of the Spanish princess, Galsuinda, in Hervé's operetta \"Chilpéric\" in 1870 and soon played there in Offenbach operettas. Successes at various London theatres followed: After a season at the Gaiety Theatre, London, Dolaro starred in an English-language Offenbach adaptation called \"Breaking the Spell\", on tour with Fred Sullivan's Operetta Company in 1871.

She starred as the title character in Offenbach's \"La Périchole\", uniting \"vivacity as an actress\" with \"taste and skill as a singer\".

Sullivan conducted the opening night performance of \"Trial\" on 25 March, but Dolaro's father generally conducted the orchestra thereafter until the end of its initial run on 12 June 1875.\n\nDolaro took her Madame Selina Dolaro's Comic Opera Co. on tour between 13 June and 10 October 1875, as the theatre was closed during the hot summer months. On their return, Charles Morton became manager of the theatre. Dolaro returned to the position in January 1876 when, again working with Carte, she played Malvina in \"The Duke's Daughter\". Dolaro continued to perform both in London and on tour, appearing at the Alhambra Theatre in 1877. In 1879 she worked at the Folly Theatre, which she also managed for the time.\n\nDolaro travelled to the United States that autumn, appearing in October at the Academy of Music in New York City in the title role of \"Carmen\", but reviews were mixed, with one critic commenting that she seemed \"much more at home\" performing in burlesque and comic opera. She then joined a touring comic opera troupe before returning to London. In 1880 she appeared again at the Globe Theatre as Cerisette in Farnie & Genee's \"The Naval Cadets\". Soon thereafter she moved to New York, where she spent the next few seasons performing in comic opera. There, she worked under Carte's agency while appearing as Girola in Bucalossi's \"Les Manteaux Noirs\" and Katrina in Robert Planquette's \"Rip van Winkle\" and as the Fairy Queen in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Iolanthe\", both in 1882 at the Standard Theatre. In 1883, an opinion piece in the \"New York Herald\" by a Reverend Philip Germond denounced \"play-acting as a godless life.\" Dolaro responded with a spirited defence of her profession: \"Had I not been ‘launched’ on this ‘godless life,’ I should probably have been a burden to some parish or perhaps launched on what I regard as indeed a godless life. ... Is it not enough that we must slave as we do to earn the means to educate and train our children so as to enable them to become useful members of society without being assailed even from the pulpit with such outrageous slander?”\n\nDolaro's last part was Minnie Marden in an adaptation of Victorien Sardou's \"Agnes\" in 1886. Her health soon began to decline, as she began to struggle with tuberculosis. Her last appearance was in New York as a supernumerary in a benefit production of \"Hamlet\" for Lester Wallack, played at Daly's Theatre in May 1888.\n\nDolaro died of a stroke in New York City in January 1889 at the age of 39.\n\nDolaro's play, \"In the Fashion\" (later known only as \"Fashion\"), ran in New York between 1887 and 1888. Her \"Mes amours: Poems, Passionate and Playful\", based on love letters that she had received, was published in 1888. She also wrote a play called \"Justine\".\n\nDolaro also wrote novels, including: \n\n\n"}

He was born in Andros, Cyclades, Ottoman Greece, as a son of a distinguished family.\n\nKairis studied in the theological school of Smyrna and was ordained a Greek Orthodox priest. He spoke many languages ranging from Ancient Greek, Latin, Italian, French, German, and English, that would allow him to participate in organizing the Greek War of Independence and to one day build the \"Orphanotropheio\" (Ὀρφανοτροφεῖο; Greek for \"Orphanage\"), a progressive school that embraced the modern university system. Kairis studied with Benjamin of Lesbos at the school of Kydonies, Asia Minor, and was introduced to contemporary science and Greek interpretations of natural science. \n\nKairis studied in Pisa and Paris, and shared to the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He studied mathematics, natural sciences and philosophy. Kairis also had an interest in archaeology, making some major findings upon his native island of Andros. He also had an interest in botany and cataloged many of the plants of his local area, as well as documenting pharmacologic properties of various plants.\n\nStarting from 1811 he led Greek language high schools in Asia Minor. Eventually, he took an active part (1819–1826) in the Greek War of Independence and is now considered as an important figure in the History of Modern Greece.\n\nOn May 10, 1821, Theophilos Kairis, one of the leading intellectuals of the Greek Revolution, declared the War of Independence by raising the Greek flag at the picturesque cliffside church of St George on the island of Andros: at this time, a famous heartfelt speech, or \"rhetoras\", inspired shipowners and merchants to contribute funds and contribute ships to build a Greek Navy to combat the Ottoman Empire. \n\nThere are many factors that influence the beginning of the Greek War of Independence. Furthermore, philosophy and science from Western Europe began to penetrate the culture of Greece at the same time of the establishment of the Philiki Etairia, which was composed of intellectuals and merchants.\n\nThe views of the Age of Enlightenment in European countries are in general well researched, while the attempts to introduce the Enlightenment to countries in the periphery of Europe, such as Greece, is not documented to the same degree. Many unanswered questions remain from this historical period, and surround the philosophic work of Theophilos Kairis. How did the scientific revolution migrate to the Greek-speaking regions occupied by the Ottoman Empire? How did the Greeks accept the truly revolutionary ideas of the French Revolution and liberalism? What were the reactions of the conservative Greek Orthodox Church and who sacrificed their lives in the cause of their ideas? \n\nMany of the orphans from the Greek War of Independence, especially from the massacre from the island of Psara would form the body of the Orphanotropheio, in which Kairis taught many of the ideas learned from Philhellenes from all over Europe. Hence, this was the first true European university of Greece. \n\nThough he was an ordained priest, Kairis fought in the War of Independence and was severely wounded in one battle. Towards the end of the war, he was selected to draft the verbiage for Greece's Constitution. But when the European Great powers of the time installed Otto von Wittelsbach as a kind of Viceroy of the Powers he was not ready to integrate himself into the new system. King Otto offered him the position of Director of the University of Athens and awarded him the Gold Cross (equivalent to the Medal of Honor) for his contribution to the war, but Kairis turned both of these down. Instead, he continued to teach radical ideas of the Enlightenment which brought him into conflict with the King and with the Eastern Orthodox Church. Kairis became a victim of the Eastern Orthodox Church's equivalent of the Holy Inquisition. Kairis suffered a tragic end reserved by fate for those who, being pioneers, tried to introduce to Greece the liberal ideas of Western Europe and the Enlightenment. The philosopher priest, Theophilos Kairis, following his conviction by the Holy Synod in 1839, was confined to the monastery in political exile on the island of Skiathos. He had been located to Syros for trial and execution but died in 1853, 10 days before his judicial hearing, of natural causes.\n\nTheophilos Kairis, founded with a few disciples, a pietistic revivalist movement, known as Theosebism, inspired by the French revolutionary cults, radical Protestantism and deism. This movement was anathematised by the Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nBeginning with 1826, Kairis dedicated himself to an institute for orphans of the Greek revolution on Andros. The \"Orphantropheio\", or orphan school, presented Kairis with the opportunity to introduce to the Greek education system a wide range of subjects ranging from comparative religion, astronomy, ship navigation, agriculture, applied mathematics, accounting, natural science, advanced mathematics, and Theosebism.\n\nMembers of the Orphanotripheio represented children from all sides of the Balkan conflict, with individuals from Bulgaria, Muslim Turks displaced by the Revolution, and Catholics who had inhabited the Greek island since the Middle Ages.\n\nIn fact, Kairis had a very different vision for an independent Greece, one that was based upon the concept of separation of church and state as proposed by Thomas Jefferson. Kairis advocated for a pan-Balkan state similar to the United States, that preserved the cosmopolitan nature of the post-Byzantine Empire era, where all creeds were equally free of tyranny from the oppressive \"Ottomans\".\n\nThis was the prelude of the so-called Eastern Question, the gradual dismemberment of the decaying Ottoman Empire by the Great powers.\n\nThe library is housed in a wonderful neoclassical building, in Hora (or Andros Town) and contains about 3,000 tomes from the collection of Theophilos Kairis. In the library are also exposed a large number of rare publications, manuscripts, historical records, works of art and a small archaeological collection. Within the records, extensive letters demonstrating a network of intellectuals would update Kairis about the trends in European science and philosophy.\n\nAlso the mathematical treatises of Kairis are present, representing a very active and original intellect, who had written on complex themes, including on mathematical extensions of Pierre-Simon Laplace's Celestial Mechanics. Artifacts that demonstrate Kairis philosophic approach to understanding the energies (energiki ousia phiseos) of nature remain in the library, and highlight Kairis knowledge of Joseph Fourier's work on energy. Through various letters and correspondence, Kairis's approach to communicating with the various philhellenes demonstrates a network of intellectuals that were involved with the French revolution. Kairis has been referred to as the \"new Socrates\" and was very active in didactic education. The island of Andros has a series of water fountains, and horizontal windmills constructed at the time the students from the orphanotropio were active on the Island, and represent applications from the Kairiki lessons. \n\nOne can find books by Professor Mavromatis in the library, who edited Kairis's mathematical work, focusing on how Kairis use the Newtonian binomial to find the roots of cardinal numbers.\n\nKairis was in constant communication with western intellectuals from Andros, and had communicated with Auguste Comte, and wrote on his treatises on sociology, then a newly emerging subject. Kairis has also incorporated these ideas into the curriculum of the orphanotropheio. Comte's ideas were tremendously influential on Kairis in the later years of the orphanotropheio, especially the idea that social ills can be solved as advocated by Jeremy Bentham.\n\nKairis spoke many languages and was interested in teaching philosophy from the ancient Greeks, translating the great poetry and theatre from antiquity, as well as the philosophic treatises of Aristotle and Plato. Furthermore, lessons on the progressive subject of comparative religion was to be invaluable for the would-be ship captains and merchants embarked on international trade. Kairis would teach theosphitism, but in the context of world religions, ranging from Buddhism, many describing the philosophical thought of Kairis similar in vein as with the Transcendentalism of Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. \n\nKiaris emphasised poetry as part of the curriculum and taught Lord Byron's work, Robert Browning as well as poetry from the French and German speaking west. This was to create a naturalist and metaphysical aptitude balanced with the natural sciences and mathematics.\n\nUnfortunately, the school was disbanded after Kairis was declared a heretic, but many of the orphanotropio would go on into the shipping professions, and were also versed in accounting and probability. Of notable family names who can trace back ancestors who were schooled by Kairis were the Goulandris and Emberikos families. Other students hid in the surrounding mountains, taking with them the banned books from the school, and continued to live with the inhabitants of the island working and building some of the most interesting windmills in Greece.\n\nIndeed, Kairis had also taught his students the early field of Archeology, and conducted field trips on the island to the place he had discovered the ruins of a temple dedicated to Aphrodite prior to the Greek revolution.\n\nTo this day, every summer, art exhibitions are organized in the new exhibition area of the library.\n\n"}

He was born in Osu, Ghana to Mr. Ricky Tetteh Quaynor and Naa Badu Quaynor. He is the last-born of their six children. At the early age of eight, by singing and rapping at parties and funfairs, he got into the music industry. In 1994 he started performing at Fun-World, an entertainment programme which was organized every Sunday at the National Theatre (Accra). He has released five studio albums since his debut.\n\nTinny was born Tinny Nii Addo Quaynor and grew up in the neighborhood of Osu and La both in Accra, Ghana. Young Tinny had his primary education at the Osu Home School and then went to Hepter International School at Akim Oda. He then went on to Osu Salem JSS and then proceeded to Okuapeman Secondary School for his secondary education. He was the entertainment prefect while he was at Okuapeman Secondary School and he organised shows for the students, as well as performed for them. He is the best friend of an artist known as RAP TWO.\n\nIn his early years, Tinny took up his first stage name Black Nature. He performed at various entertainment shows with that name. While he was in Osu Salem JSS, he joined forces with two of his friends, Salam and Buke, who called themselves \"Black Agony\" as a duo, and formed a whole new a group called \"Nature and Agony\". This group was managed by Tinny's father, Mr. Ricky Tetteh Quaynor. They performed at by then very popular teenage music shows such as Kiddafest and Fun-World. However, Agony did not like the idea of Tinny's father managing them thus, they left the group. Tinny then went solo to perform at ‘Ecstasy Promotions’ where he chalked the 1st position. When he got to Okuapeman Secondary School, his dad booked sessions for him with Hammer of The Last Two which landed him into being part of the Last 2 family as a 'foot soldier'.\n\nIt was quite difficult for Tinny to come out since most hiplife artistes at the time sang and rapped in twi and Tinny on the other hand, was a native Ga speaker and was therefore fixed on rapping in his ga language. His dream of making it to the top of the hiplife ladder came true when Hammer of The Last Two secured a deal for him with Abraham Ohene Djan (CEO of OM Studios). Abraham was carried away by his impressive lyrical flow after listening to his album, he agreed to produce him. With a beat maker like Hammer at the helm of things, Nii Addo decided to use the name Tinny as his stage name because it was his real name and blasted onto the Ghanaian music scene in 2003 with ‘Makola Kwakwe’. He quickly became a sensation, gracing events and dominating radio and TV in his category. Tinny’s fame increased when he featured on the remix of ‘Oye Ohene’. His went on with his career and featured atrtises like Dogo, Obrafour, K.K. Fosu, Etuoaboba, Bandana, FBS and Okra. He goes on to bless Obrafour’s Execution Diary with his voice on a track called I Believe I Can Fly (Heko Ejorko). Tinny won several awards following his debut like the New Artiste of the year at both Ghana Music Awards 2004 and Ghana Music Awards UK 2004 and a Youth Excellence award for being the ‘Youth Musician of the year 2003’. He was also awarded for being the Best Guest Entertainment Musical Artiste by Great Lamptey Mills.\n\nIn 2007, Tinny was picked by MTV to have his video for 'Incomplete' shot by world-renowned director Rachel Watanabe-Batton. This track was taken from his Aletse Ogboo album. In 2008, Tinny had the chance to record a single with Ja Rule when Ja Rule was in Ghana to perform during the 2008 Ghana Music Awards.\n\nSince his debut he has maintained his position as an A-list artiste in Ghana, and as kept his name on top of the music charts.\n\nHis knack at making Ga (a local dialect he usually sings and raps in) proverbs sound more appealing and the distinct style with which he flows (mostly rhyming) has not only endeared him to the youth across Africa but won him the respect of native Ga speaking people .\n“Ricky, Naa Badu, Nakutso Bi” a popular line in most of his songs confirms the immeasurable support he receives from his parents Mr. Ricky Tetteh Quaynor and Christie –Lee Naa Badu Quaynor.\n\nCadbury launched a campaign using Ghanaian traditional culture to raise additional funds for cocoa growing communities. The campaign was a promotion for Tinny's track Zingolo, as well as the Ghana-based dance troupe High Spirits. The Zingolo single is available on iTunes, with proceeds going to CARE, which funds education in Ghana's cocoa growing communities. The move follows the recent certification of Cadbury Dairy Milk across the UK and Ireland and builds on the work of the Cadbury Cocoa Partnership, a 10-year initiative launched in 2008.\n\nThe Zingolo campaign was developed at Fallon, London, by executive creative director Richard Flintham, creative directors Chris Bovill, John Allison, creatives Filip Tyden, Dan Watts, Chris Bovill, John Allison, account director Nathalie Clarke, agency producer Tom Goodwin, executive producer Nicky Barnes and agency producer Gemma Knight.\n\nThe song, \"Zingolo\", was released on the newly established record label Glass and a Half Full Records, established by Cadbury's Dairy Milk following their move to Fairtrade chocolate.\nThe song, and the record label, were also set up to celebrate \"all things Ghana, its people, its rappers, its dancers, it's cultural figures and, of course, its cocoa beans\"\n\nThe advertisement was broadcast on television and cinema. Featuring a 1-minute edit of the song, it is a short music video showing Ghana and a \"cocoa head\". It is their fourth advertisement in the \"Glass and a Half Full Productions\" campaign, which begun in 2007 with the award-winning Gorilla advertisement.\n\nOn 2 January 2007 he organized and performed two songs at his grand New Year’s party for 300 HIV/AIDS orphaned children at Manya-krobo in the eastern region of Ghana to mark the beginning of his “Mytinny – Contribution Campaign” which he says would be his Annual Social Responsibility Project.\nIn January 2012 Tinny, as a former student of Okuapeman, visited the school to celebrate his birthday with the blind students with the aim of putting smiles on their faces.\nAmong the items donated included food and drinks, talking calculators, 51 packets of braille sheets among others.\nThe birthday party was organized by Hear Our Say Ghana, an Accra-based Non-Governmental Organzsation with support from Akua Pokua and Arisa, volunteers from Belgium and Japan respectively. Richard Berko, Tinny's Manager told BEATWAVES that students always looked up to them as their source of encouragement. 'I think most of us are in a position to help them and that is exactly what Tinny has done'.Speaking to the children, Tinny encouraged them to learn extra hard to become influential people in society, despite the poor conditions they found themselves in now.

Martin Jr.\n\nWade Omer Martin Jr. (April 18, 1911 – August 6, 1990) was the Democratic Secretary of State of Louisiana under five governors, having served from 1944 to 1976. Though originally part of the Long faction, Martin quarreled with Governor Earl Kemp Long during Long's third term in office, and Long relieved Martin of nearly all of his powers as secretary of state.\n\nAfter having considered a gubernatorial bid on several occasions, Martin finally ran for governor in 1975, when, at sixty-six, he was overshadowed by the popular incumbent, Democrat Edwin Washington Edwards, who easily secured a second term. In retirement, the conservative Martin, thereafter firmly anti-Long, switched his party affiliation in 1979 to Republican to support David C. Treen for governor and Ronald W. Reagan for president.\n\nMartin was born in Arnaudville in St. Landry Parish to Wade O. Martin Sr. and the former Alice Mills. His grandfathers were Dr. G.W. Martin and Patrick Mills; his grandmothers were Ida Guilbeau Martin and Justine Fanguy Mills.\n\nMartin received his bachelor's degree from what is now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then Southwestern Louisiana Institute) in 1932. In 1935, he received his law degree from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. Martin was also an LSU alumnus. On October 25, 1938, Martin married the former Juliette Bonnette (July 28, 1916—August 24, 1999).\n\nMartin was an intimate of Governor and Senator Huey Pierce Long Jr. In 1932, Martin was elected to the then District 2 seat on the Louisiana Public Service Commission. He served for twenty-four years until his death in August 1956. After the assassination of Huey Long, Martin had tried to run for governor in 1935 but was unable to mount a serious campaign.\n\nMartin Jr. was an assistant Attorney General of Louisiana from 1935-1940. He set up a law practice in Baton Rouge from 1940-1944. He ran for Secretary of State against incumbent James Gremillion, an appointee of anti-Long Governor Sam Houston Jones.\n\nMartin Sr. and Jr. coaxed Gremillion to withdraw from the race, in which Gremillion had run second to Wade Jr. Gremillion's exit hence made Wade Jr. the official Democratic nominee, equivalent at the time to election in overwhelmingly Democratic Louisiana. William J. \"Bill\" Dodd, a state legislator at the time of the 1944 election, wrote in his memoirs, \"Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics\", \"That a deal was made seemed evident -- when Gremillion wound up with a big job in Wade Jr.'s office.\"\n\nThe possibility had existed that there would have been no runoffs at all in 1944 if the Long candidate for governor, Lewis Lovering Morgan of Covington in St. Tammany Parish, had decided not to pursue a second primary against Jimmie Davis. Louisiana law then allowed runoffs for the lesser constitutional office only if there was also a runoff for governor. Somehow, the Martins convinced Gremillion that he would lose a runoff and that he should bow out and continue to work in the secretary of state's office, but under Wade Jr.\n\nEarl Long later learned that his presumed allies, the Martins, along with Register of State Lands Lucille May Grace Dent, and others, had coaxed Morgan, whom Dodd called an \"aged and somewhat senile attorney,\" to remain in the running for governor. At first, Morgan said that he would not challenge Davis in a runoff. The Martins and Miss Grace did not expect Morgan to defeat Davis. What they were attempting, according to Dodd, was the defeat of Earl Long, who was a candidate for lieutenant governor in a looming runoff against J. Emile Verret of Iberia Parish. Earl Long had led in the primary and would have become the Democratic nominee for the second spot had Morgan chosen not to continue the challenge to Davis. And while Davis defeated Morgan in the runoff, the results were closer than many had expected.\n\nAfter his 1956 inauguration, Long convinced the legislature, the majority of the members being Long allies at the time, to move against Martin, who was himself considered a \"Longite\" by unofficial affiliation. Martin's office was stripped of four essential duties:\n\n(1) a separate commissioner of insurance (Martin was insurance commissioner AND secretary of state from 1944-1956.) would be established, with Rufus D. Hayes, taking the new position until 1964\n\n(2) a separate position of \"custodian of voting machines,\" later called \"elections commissioner,\" would be established, and the secretary of state would no longer sit on the board that handled the purchase of voting machines,\n\n(3) the secretary of state would no longer handle voter registration, and\n\n(4) the secretary could no longer contract for and purchase printing services.\n\nWhat duties did Martin retain? There were few, and all of an administrative nature. According to Bill Dodd, \"Wade Jr. howled and screamed and accused Earl of being vindictive. But seasoned politicians and those who knew the facts of the 1944 campaign felt that little Wade got what politicians usually get when they do what Wade had done.\"\n\nMartin was the author of the legislation providing for the numbering of candidates on election ballots to speed voting and to provide secrecy of the ballot for illiterates. He was a past president of the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\nOver time, the secretary of state's office gradually regained its previous level of duties. The office was modernized and improved considerably during the long tenure of a Martin successor, W. Fox McKeithen, a Republican who served from 1988 (when he was a Democrat) to his death in 2005. However, there still remains a separate insurance commissioner's office. Martin had appointed only one Assistant Secretary of State his entire tenure of office from 1944–1975, that being Joseph Riley Nelson of Baton Rouge.\n\nIn 1964, Martin joined a group of more conservative Louisiana Democrats who endorsed Republican Barry M. Goldwater for president in the contest against Lyndon B. Johnson. Others who supported Goldwater were Caddo Parish Sheriff J. Howell Flournoy of Shreveport, former Governors Sam Jones and Robert F. Kennon, Lieutenant Governor C. C. \"Taddy\" Aycock, and Monroe Mayor W. L. \"Jack\" Howard.\n\nToward the end of his tenure, Martin hired Sandra Thompson, who was later the director of the Atchafalaya Basin Project. She ran unsuccessfully for secretary of state in 1979.\n\nMartin considered a gubernatorial run in 1948, but he then pulled back to seek reelection, when he realized that Earl Long was a strong contender that year.\n\nIn 1969, Martin was appointed chairman of the state Radio Free Europe Fund. Earlier, he had been the first Louisiana resident to have been president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, when that office had been within the umbrella of the secretary of state.\n\nIn 1971, Republican leader David Treen tried to persuade Martin, who was considered a conservative within the Democratic Party, to switch parties and run as the GOP candidate for governor in 1972. Martin again declined to run for governor and instead won an eighth consecutive term as secretary of state. Treen in fact made the first of his three gubernatorial races that year. The names \"Wade O. Martin Jr.\" and \"Louisiana secretary of state\" had become synonyms in the Bayou State, or at the least there was a strong 32-year connection.\n\nMartin finally ran for governor in 1975, after which time he had decided to retire as secretary of state. Edwin Edwards faced two Democrats that year, Martin and State Senator Robert G. \"Bob\" Jones of Lake Charles, son of former Governor Sam Jones. Edwards prevailed with ease: 750,107 votes (62.3 percent). Bob Jones ran second with 292,220 votes (24.3 percent). Martin ran a weak third with 146,363 ballots (12.2 percent). Both Jones and Martin got some unofficial Republican backing in the gubernatorial election, and Jones was considered a possible candidate for 1979. Thereafter, both Jones and Martin became Republicans, but neither sought office again. Two Democrats, P.J. Mills, a banker and a former state representative from Shreveport, and State Senator Paul J. Hardy of St. Martinville, contested Martin's seat in the 1975 general election. Hardy prevailed by some twenty thousand votes over another Democrat, P. J. Mills.\n\nMartin was thirty and married when the United States entered World War II, but he did not enlist. Dodd, a World War II veteran, said he believed that Martin's failure to serve may have been a reason that he did not attempt to run earlier for governor. Of course, non-military service did not necessarily hurt Earl Long, whom Dodd flatly claimed in his memoir \"was a draft dodger\" in World War I.\n\nMartin was a Roman Catholic and, like his father, a member of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic men's organization. He was also active in the Woodmen of the World and was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity and the Kiwanis International. He was on the board of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, or CODOFIL. He was a fundraiser for the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and United Cerebral Palsy.\n\nIn retirement, Martin spent much time on his St. Martin Parish farm, where he raised sugar cane and other crops, including crawfish. He pioneered in the raising of fresh water shrimp in Louisiana. He also wrote books about government, practiced law, and was a consultant to the Louisiana Elections Integrity Commission.\n\nMartin died in his Baton Rouge home. Services were held in St. Martin De Tours Catholic Church in St. Martinville. Burial was in St. Francis Regis Cemetery in Arnaudville. Survivors included four sons, Wade O. Martin III (born 1944), of Baton Rouge, David Mills Martin (born 1950) of Jackson, Mississippi, Wallace T. Martin (born 1955) of Ridgecrest, California (Kern County), and Gregory Bonnette Martin of Baton Rouge; two daughters, Mrs. Merle M. Dooley of Covington and Mrs. Marcelle M. Sherrill of Paducah, Kentucky; a brother, Dr. Murphy Martin (born 1913); two sisters, Leona M. Guirard (1908–2000) and Jeanne M. Svendson (1915–2002), fifteen grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Martin was divorced from his wife Juliette. She was living for a time in Ridgecrest to be near son Wallace Martin but had returned to Baton Rouge shortly before the time of her death. Grandson of Dr. Murphy Martin, Murphy \"Tracy\" Martin III, a grandson of Dr. Murphy Martin, is a physician, currently rotating at theEarl K. Long Medical Center in the field of internal medicine.\n\nThe auditorium of the Louisiana State Archives building, a part of the secretary of state's office, is named in Martin's honor. Martin is also remembered for his trademark bow tie. Martin was posthumously inducted in 2002 into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.\n\n"}
