The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the National Olympic Committee or by the athletes themselves to represent their country.\n\nAs the nation of the first modern Olympic Games, Greece entered the stadium first; whereas, the host nation of the United States marched last. Other countries entered in alphabetical order in the language of the host country (English), according with tradition and IOC guidelines.\n\nWhilst most countries entered under their short names, a few entered under more formal or alternative names, mostly due to political and naming disputes. Macedonia entered as \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'\" because of the naming dispute with Greece. The Republic of China (commonly known as Taiwan) entered with the compromised name and flag of \"Chinese Taipei\" under T so that they did not enter together with conflicting People's Republic of China (commonly known as China), which entered as the \"People's Republic of China\" under C. The Republic of the Congo entered as just \"Congo\" while the Democratic Republic of Congo entered under its former name, Zaire. Iran, Moldova, Laos, Brunei and the United States all entered under their formal names, respectively \"Islamic Republic of Iran\", \"Republic of Moldova\", \"Lao People's Democratic Republic\", \"Brunei Darussalam\" and \"United States of America\".\n\nA record of 197 nations entered the stadium with a combined total of 10,318 athletes. Twenty-four nations made their Olympic debut, including eleven of the former Soviet republics, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia (although it had been competed independently in 1912 under the Russian Empire), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, that had previously competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992. Czech Republic and Slovakia attended the Games independently for the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1993, whereas Cambodia returned officially after its 24-year absence under the Khmer Republic.\n\nNotable flag bearers in the opening ceremony featured the following athletes: weightlifter Pyrros Dimas (Greece; eventing rider Andrew Hoy (Australia); nine-time Olympian and Star sailor Hubert Raudaschl (Austria); 1984 Olympic middle-distance champion Joaquim Cruz (Brazil) in the 800 metres; track sprinters Charmaine Crooks (Canada) and Marie-José Pérec (France); defending Olympic long-distance champions Derartu Tulu (Ethiopia) and Khalid Skah (Morocco), both in the 10,000 metres; fencers Arnd Schmitt (Germany), Bence Szabó (Hungary), and Giovanna Trillini (Italy); rowing legend Steve Redgrave (Great Britain); swimmers Raimundas Mažuolis (Lithuania) in sprint freestyle and Rafał Szukała (Poland) in the butterfly; windsurfer Barbara Kendall (New Zealand); hurdler and world champion Brigita Bukovec (Slovenia); defending Olympic champions Jan-Ove Waldner (Sweden) in men's table tennis singles, and Andrey Abduvaliyev in the hammer throw; pole vaulter and world record holder Sergey Bubka (Ukraine); and super heavyweight wrestlers Alexander Karelin (Russia) in Greco-Roman, and Bruce Baumgartner (United States) in freestyle.\n\nThe following is a list of each country's announced flag bearer. The list is sorted by the order in which each nation appears in the parade of nations. This table is sortable by country name (in English), the flag bearer's name, and the flag bearer's sport. The names are given in their official designations by the IOC.\n"}

{"id": "1738916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1738916", "title": "Batna, Algeria", "text": "Batna, Algeria\n\nBatna () is the main city of Batna Province, Algeria. With a population of 290,645 (2008 census) it is the fifth largest city in Algeria. It is also one of the principal cities of the Chaoui area and is considered the capital of the Aures.\n\nThe first solid foundations (a military encampment) of the city were erected by a French garrison in 1844, with a strategic mission to create a permanently guarded access point for the main Sahara road.\n\nBatna's geographical location offers a natural break through the Atlas Mountains. The Romans did not detect this passage in their early invasion phase.\n\nThe ancient cities of Timgad and Lambese, built around the first century CE, are living examples of the importance that the Romans gave to commercial control over the region.\n\nThe inhabitants of the city revolted against the French authorities at the beginning of colonization. Thereafter they organized the Algerian revolution against French colonialism.\n\nThe first Batneens adhered to Messali Hadj (PPP), as did the Ulemas Ben Badis and the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Freedoms (MTLD), and together they organized the great historic summit of 22, June 25, 1954.\n\nThe Algerian revolution started at Batna under the chairmanship of Batnéen Mustapha Benboulaïd (FLN). Batna was the first military region of L 'Algeria (zone 1) 1954 1962. \nOn the night of November 1, 1954, the barracks of the city of Batna was attacked by the mujahedeen. \nBatna was the command headquarters of the Algerian revolution until independence.\n\nOn September 6, 2007, Batna saw a massive Al-Qaeda suicide bombing. The bombing, which took place shortly before the visit of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, resulted in approximately 15–20 deaths and 107 injuries as the bomber detonated his device among a crowd waiting to see the President, who was at the end of a three-day tour of eastern Algeria. The bombings were condemned by the UN Security Council.\n\nLocated in the Aurès Mountains (part of the Atlas Mountains), at above sea level, Batna has a semi-arid climate with Mediterranean influences and an average annual precipitation of . Summers are moderately hot (by Saharan standards) and dry and winters are chilly and wetter, with the possibility of snowfall. This climate is described by the Köppen climate classification as \"BSk\".\n\nMany entertainment resorts are spread across the town. Regarding sports activities the most important destinations are the 1st November Stadium (Stade du premier Novembre), and Seffouhi Stadium, which is used mainly for soccer clubs and festivals (CAB & MSPB are the biggest teams in the city), in addition to the Scholar Stadium. For cultural activities there is the , and also a municipal Cultural House, which is located behind the Prefecture and covers many cultural and educational activities, in addition to the Islamic Cultural Center in the heart of the city and the Youth House in Cite Ennaser. For children, an attraction park is located in Kechida, which is approximately a ten-minute drive from the downtown area.\n\nWith regard to night life, due to some religious and cultural limitations, there are almost no night clubs in the city. However, the existing nightlife is concentrated in the heart of the city, around \"Les allées Benboulaïd\" and \"STAND\" areas, especially during summer break. Downtown Batna has plenty of cafés, traditional restaurants (Chouwaya) or GARGOUTTIER, Pizzerias, French and oriental bakeries, and a limited number of luxury restaurants. Many festivities take place in \"allées Ben Boulaïd\" area, mainly in the season of International Timgad Festival (usually between 4-15 July every year). The most attractive exciting places surrounding the city are, Lambese (also called Lambaesis), Timgad, Ghoufi, Chelaalaa, and Belezma National Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "339185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339185", "title": "Ben Nighthorse Campbell", "text": "Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\nBen Nighthorse Campbell (born April 13, 1933) is an American politician who was a U.S. Senator from Colorado from 1993 until 2005. Campbell was a three-term U.S. Representative from 1987 to 1993, when he was sworn into office as a Senator following his election on November 3, 1992. Campbell also serves as one of forty-four members of the Council of Chiefs of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe.\n\nOriginally a member of the Democratic Party, Campbell switched to the Republican Party on March 3, 1995. Reelected in 1998, Campbell announced in March 2004 that he would not run for reelection to a third term in November of that year. He expressed interest in running for Governor of Colorado in 2006. However, on January 4, 2006, he announced that he would not enter the race. His Senate seat was won by Democrat Ken Salazar in the November 2004 election. He later became a lobbyist for the law and lobbying firm Holland & Knight and afterward co-founded his own lobbying firm, Ben Nighthorse Consultants.\n\nCampbell was born Benny Campbell in Auburn, California. His mother, Mary Vierra (Vieira), was a Portuguese immigrant who had come with her mother to the U.S. at age six through Ellis Island, (according to Campbell, his maternal grandfather had entered the United States some time before.) The Vierra family settled in the large Portuguese community near Sacramento. When Mary Vierra contracted tuberculosis in her youth, she was forced to convalesce at a nearby hospital, often for months at a time during treatment. It was there that she met an American Indian patient Albert Campbell, who was at the hospital for alcoholism treatment. Albert Campbell was of predominantly Northern Cheyenne descent but, according to Nighthorse Campbell biographer Herman Viola, Albert Campbell spent much of his youth in Crow Agency boarding school and may have had some Pueblo Indian and Apache Indian blood in his background as well. The couple married in 1929, and Campbell was born in 1933.\n\nDuring Campbell's childhood, his father continued to have problems with alcoholism, often leaving the family for weeks and months at a time. His mother continued to have health problems with tuberculosis, a highly contagious disease that limited the contact she could have with her children and continued to force her into the hospital for long periods of time. These problems led to Ben and his older sister Alberta (who died in an apparent suicide at age 44) spending much of their early lives in nearby Catholic orphanages. As a young man, Campbell was introduced to the Japanese martial art of judo by Japanese immigrant families he met while working in local agricultural fields.\n\nCampbell attended Placer High School, dropping out in 1951 to join the U.S. Air Force. He was stationed in Korea during the Korean War as an air policeman; he left the Air Force in 1953 with the rank of Airman Second Class, as well as the Korean Service Medal and the Air Medal. While in the Air Force, Campbell obtained his GED and, following his discharge, used his G.I. Bill to attend San Jose State University, where he graduated in 1957 with a Bachelor of Arts in Physical Education and Fine Arts.\n\nHe is listed as \"Ben M. Campbell\" in his college records and records of his Olympic competition, but was given the name \"Nighthorse\" when he returned to the Northern Cheyenne reservation for his name-giving ceremony, as a member of his father's family, Blackhorse.\n\nWhile in college, Campbell was a member of the San Jose State judo team, coached by future USA Olympic coach Yosh Uchida. While training for the Olympic Games, Campbell attended Meiji University in Tokyo, Japan as a special research student from 1960-1964. The Meiji team was world-renowned and Campbell credited the preparation and discipline taught at Meiji for his 1961, 1962, and 1963 U.S. National titles and his gold medal in the 1963 Pan-American Games. In 1964, Campbell competed in judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He suffered an injury and did not win a medal. He broke his ankle and was out for two years.\n\nIn the years after returning from the Olympic Games, Campbell worked as a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, California, coached the U.S. National Judo Team, operated his own dojo in Sacramento, and taught high school (physical education and art classes). He and his wife also raised quarterhorses, including a Supreme Champion and AQHA Champion, \"Sailors Night\". They bought a ranch near Ignacio, Colorado on the Southern Ute reservation in 1978.\n\nIn the book \"Ben Nighthorse Campbell: An American Warrior\", by Herman Viola, Campbell tells of learning to make jewelry from his father and flattening silver dollars on train tracks for the materials. He also used techniques learned from sword makers in Japan and other non-traditional techniques to win over 200 national and international awards for jewelry design under the name, \"Ben Nighthorse\" and was included in a feature article in the late 1970s in \"Arizona Highways\" magazine about Native artists experimenting in the 'new look' of Indian jewelry.\nCampbell has works on display with the Art of the Olympians organization.\n\nCampbell was elected to the Colorado State Legislature as a Democrat in November 1982, where he served two terms. He was voted one of the 10 Best Legislators by his colleagues in a 1986 \"Denver Post\" – News Center 4 survey. Campbell was elected in 1986 to the US House of Representatives, defeating incumbent Congressman Mike Strang; he was re-elected twice to this seat. In 1989, he authored the bill HR 2668 to establish the National Museum of the American Indian, which became PL 101-185.\n\nThe early 1990s marked a turning point in Campbell's political career. In 1992, following the announced retirement of Senator Tim Wirth, Campbell won a three-way Democratic primary with former three-term Governor Richard Lamm and Boulder County Commissioner Josie Heath, who had been the party's nominee in 1990. During the primary campaign, Lamm supporters accused Heath of \"spoiling\" the election by splitting the vote of the party's left wing. Heath's campaign pointed out that it was Campbell who should not have been running because his voting record in Congress had been much more like that of a Republican. Campbell won the primary with 45% of the vote and then defeated Republican State Senator Terry Considine in the general election. As a Democrat, Campbell was the first Native American elected to serve in the United States Senate.\n\nIn March 1995, after two years in office, Senator Campbell switched parties from Democratic to Republican in the wake of publicized disputes he had with the Colorado Democratic Party. The Senator said that the final straw for him was the Senate's defeat of the balanced-budget amendment, which he has championed since coming to Washington as a congressman in 1987. Others attributed the switch to personal hostility within the Democratic Party in Colorado.\n\nIn 1998, Campbell won re-election to the Senate by what was then the largest margin in Colorado history for a statewide race. After winning re-election, Campbell identified as a moderate Republican saying that <nowiki>\"</nowiki>[his re-election] shows the moderate voices within the Republican Party are dominating.<nowiki>\"</nowiki> In the 106th Congress, he passed more public laws than any individual member of Congress. During his tenure, Campbell also became the first American Indian to chair the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. He retired from office in January 2005.\n\nThe Senate ethics committee investigated accusations that his former chief of staff inflated bonuses to an aide in 2002 so he could return the money to the chief of staff. In subsequent interviews, the chief of staff and aide both asserted that Campbell had approved of the deal.\n\nAfter his retirement, Campbell was a senior policy advisor at the firm of Holland and Knight, LLP in Washington, DC. In July 2012, he left that firm to found Ben Nighthorse Consultants, a new lobbying firm. He also continues to design and craft his Ben Nighthorse line of American Indian jewelry.\n\nCompleted in 2011, Lake Nighthorse, a 120,000-acre-foot reservoir in southwestern Colorado, is named in his honor.\n\nCampbell is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.\n\nIn 1966, Campbell married the former Linda Price, a public school teacher who was a native of Colorado. The couple have two married children, Colin (Karen) Campbell and Shanan (John) Wells. They have four grandchildren. The Campbells still reside in Colorado.\n\nLinda Campbell was the sponsor of USS \"Mesa Verde\" (LPD 19) on January 15, 2005.\n\n\n"}

Rogers is a left-handed opening batsman. He spent ten years playing for Western Australia, before moving to play for Victoria in 2008. He has played county cricket in England for the past ten years for five first-class teams Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Middlesex and Somerset.\n\nDespite being colour blind and short sighted, he maintained a first-class average of nearly 50, yet he did not play for the Australia national cricket team until the age of 30, when he was selected for a single Test match in 2008. He was recalled to the Australia national team for the 2013 Ashes series, aged 35, and over the following two years played a further 24 Tests opening the batting for Australia before retiring after the 2015 Ashes series.\n\nBorn in St George, Sydney, Rogers' father, John Rogers played for New South Wales between 1969 and 1970. He is also a cousin of Australian chess grandmaster Ian Rogers.\n\nRogers made one Youth Test match appearance, against New Zealand in 1996. Rogers' batting talent had led some to anoint him as the next Australian opener, replacing Justin Langer.\n\nHe first came to England in 1996 to play in the Devon Cricket League for North Devon CC under the watchful eye of former Gloucestershire player and Test match umpire David Shepherd. He came back the following year to score a league record aggregate of 1,273 runs but could not save the Instow Club from relegation.\n\nIn 2002 he played for Exeter, also in the Devon League, and in 2003 he returned to England once again to play for Wellington CC in the Shropshire League The welter of runs he contributed saw them move from the Furrow's Shropshire League to the Birmingham League where they were again promoted. He was unable to play Minor Counties cricket but did make one appearance for Shropshire in the Nat West Trophy where overseas players were allowed, but made a duck in his only game.\n\nHe made his first trip into English First Class cricket playing for Derbyshire in 2004, where despite suffering from a shoulder injury, played well. He moved to Leicestershire in the second half of the 2005 season, where he averaged over 70, and scored one double-century against the touring Australians. In 2006 he moved to Northamptonshire and immediately made his mark with fifty fours, two sixes, and a final score of 319 from 417 balls against Gloucestershire.\n\nIn October 2006 he and Marcus North put on a record domestic third wicket partnership of 459, Western Australia v Victoria, at the WACA. Rogers' score of 279 was the second highest ever by a West Australian, behind the 355 not out that Geoff Marsh scored at the same ground in December 1989. On 5 February 2007 Rogers was awarded the 'State Cricket Player of the Year' prize at the Allan Border Medal presentation.\n\nHe returned to Derbyshire for the 2008 season, playing as their overseas player when Mahela Jayawardene declared himself unavailable due to his commitments with Sri Lanka and the Indian Premier League, and has since become the temporary captain after the resignation of Rikki Clarke. Despite being both short-sighted and colourblind (a fact that was said to put him at a bigger disadvantage when using the pink ball for the first day-night test against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval), Rogers has proven himself to be a sharp player both at and away from the crease. Rogers has also played for Shropshire, representing them during one match of the C&G Trophy.\nIn 2008, he walked out on the Western Warriors, reportedly over his status as a fringe-player in the state's one-day team, and joined Victoria for the 2008/2009 season.\n\nIn 2008, Rogers hit 248 not out, carrying his bat for Derbyshire against Warwickshire. The score is the third-highest single-innings total in a first-class match by a Derbyshire player, and the highest score for 62 years. The innings meant Rogers had registered a double century for all four first-class domestic teams that he had represented.\n\nIn 2010, after relinquishing the Derbyshire captaincy to Greg Smith, Rogers joined Middlesex for the 2011 season, and was appointed captain of the first-class County Championship side in 2014.\n\nIn 2016 he joined Somerset, being appointed captain of the Championship side on his arrival. Rogers retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 2016 season; in his final match for Somerset he made twin hundreds in their 325-run victory over Nottinghamshire.\n\nIn May 2007, Rogers was awarded his first national contract with Cricket Australia. On 13 January 2008, he was added to the Australia Test squad as a cover for the injured Matthew Hayden, who had torn a hamstring, and he made his Test debut in the third Test against India at the WACA Ground on 16 January, but the Baggy Green had to be replaced a day later because Rogers' cap was too small, and he unsuccessfully tried to make it bigger to alleviate headaches caused by fielding all day in the scorching heat. Australia were chasing a world-record 17th consecutive Test victory, but found the going difficult. Rogers scored four runs in the first innings of 212 and 15 in the second innings as Australia unsuccessfully chased a target of over 400. His national contract was subsequently terminated in April 2008. Rogers commented that he \"didn't see it coming, I'll have to accept it and try to get back in.\"\n\nOn 24 April 2013 and at age 35, Rogers was named in the 16-man Australian Test squad for the 2013 Ashes tour in England, more than five years after his previous Test. He opened the batting throughout the series, partnering initially with Shane Watson and later with David Warner, and made 367 runs at 40.77 for the series to be Australia's third-highest scorer. Rogers scored his maiden Test century in the first innings of the fourth Test, in difficult seaming conditions at the Riverside International Cricket Ground, Durham.\n\nFollowing his success in England, Rogers held his place as an opening batsman for the next two years. In the return Ashes series in the 2013/14 summer, Rogers scored 463 runs at 46.30 to again be Australia's third-highest scorer. He scored his second Test century, and his first on Australian soil, in Australia's successful fourth-innings run-chase in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground,<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 26–29 December 2013 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 – Australia v England\"></ref> and he backed that up with his third Test century in the second innings of the New Year's Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground with a score of 119.<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 3–5 January 2014 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 – Australia v England\"></ref> He then scored a rearguard century of 107 against South Africa in the second innings of the second Test in Port Elizabeth in February 2014,<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 20–23 February 2014 - Australia tour of South Africa, 2013/14 – South Africa v Australia\"></ref> which was his only score above 50 in the series where he averaged 30.16. A two-Test series in the UAE against Pakistan in late 2014 was the leanest of Rogers' career, managing only 88 runs at 22.00.\n\nRogers returned to form during the 2014/15 summer, scoring 417 runs at 52.12 in the four-Test home series against India. He failed to score a century in the series, but managed consecutive half-centuries over his last six innings. He toured with Australia in its 2015 tour of the West Indies, but missed both matches with concussion after being struck in the head during a net session.\n\nRogers returned from his concussion the following month for the 2015 Ashes series in England, which he had announced before the tour would be his last before retiring from international cricket. He extended his sequence of consecutive Test half-centuries to a record-equalling seven innings in the first Test at Cardiff, before being dismissed for ten in the second innings. He batted through the entire first day on his way to the highest score of his Test career (173) in the first innings of the second Test at Lord's, and made an unbeaten 49 before retiring hurt in the second innings after suffering a dizzy spell. He finished the series with 480 runs at 60.00, the highest average across both teams, and was awarded Australian Player of the Series.\n\nDespite a relatively short career of 25 Tests, Rogers retired having gained admiration for his watchful, consistent batting at the top of the order; in particular, during the two Ashes series he played in England, he was one of Australia's most consistent batsmen in the seaming and swinging conditions. For all but the first few Tests of his international career, he formed a successful opening partnership with David Warner, generally playing an anchoring role to Warner's more aggressive style; in only 41 innings together, the pair shared nine century partnerships.\n\nRogers received a belated sendoff at the 2015 Boxing Day Test where he rode a lap of honour around the MCG and received a mushroom stand to rest his Baggy Green cap.\n\n\"as of 23 August 2015\"\n"}

{"id": "35865318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35865318", "title": "Costa Ricans", "text": "Costa Ricans\n\nCosta Ricans (Spanish: Costarricenses), also called Ticos, are a group of peoples from a multiethnic Spanish speaking nation in Central America called Costa Rica. Costa Ricans are predominantly whites, castizos (halfway between white and mestizo) and mestizo, but their country is considered a multiethnic society, which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic backgrounds. As a result, modern-day Costa Ricans do not consider their nationality as an ethnicity but as a citizenship with various ethnicities. Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattoes, Blacks, Asians, and Amerindians. In addition to the \"Indigenas\", whites, mestizos, blacks and mulattoes, Costa Rica is also home to thousands of Asians. Most of the Chinese and Indians now living in the country are descendants of those that arrived during the 19th century as migrant workers.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, Costa Rica has a population of 4,301,712 people. The population growth rate between 2005 and 2010 was estimated to be 1.5% annually, with a birth rate of 17.8 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 4.1 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. By 2016, the population had increased to about 4.9 million.\n\nCosta Rica was the point where the Mesoamerican and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of Nahuatl cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors (conquistadores) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had Chibcha influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with Jamaican immigrant workers during the 19th century. The country has received immigration from Europe, Africa, Asia, Americas, Middle East etc. The inmigration received from Nicaragua and the rest of Central America during the last century can be perceived nowadays in every corner of the country\n\nThe colonial period began when Christopher Columbus reached the eastern coast of Costa Rica on his fourth voyage in 1502. Numerous subsequent Spanish expeditions followed, eventually leading to the first Spanish colony, Villa Bruselas in Costa Rica in 1524.\n\nDuring most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which was nominally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (i.e., Mexico), but which in practice operated as a largely autonomous entity within the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition under Spanish law to trade with its southern neighbors in Panama, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (i.e., Colombia), and the lack of resources such as gold and silver, made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica was described as \"the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America\" by a Spanish governor in 1719.\n\nAnother important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for forced labor, which meant that most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large \"haciendas\". For all these reasons Costa Rica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the Spanish Crown and left to develop on its own. The small landowners' relative poverty, the lack of a large indigenous labor force, the population's ethnic and linguistic homogeneity, and Costa Rica's isolation from the Spanish colonial centers in Mexico and the Andes all contributed to the development of an autonomous and individualistic agrarian society. Even the Governor had to farm his own crops and tend to his own garden due to the poverty that he lived in. An egalitarian tradition also arose. Costa Rica became a \"rural democracy\" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowlands.\n\n most Costa Ricans are primarily of Spanish ancestry with minorities of German, Nicaraguan, Italian, Jamaican, Colombian, Central American and Greek ancestry or mixed. \n\nEuropean migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to reach the USA West Coast (California) in the late 19th century and until the 1910s (before the Panama Canal opened). Other ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Venezuelans, Peruvian, Brazilians, Portuguese, Palestinians, Caribbeans, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.\n\nMany of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to Christianity who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition. The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous.\n\nCosta Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattos, Blacks, Amerindians and Asians. About 8% of the population is of Black African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans, English-speaking descendants of 19th century black Jamaican immigrant workers.\n\nIn 1873 the Atlantic Railroad imported 653 Chinese indentured laborers, hoping to duplicate the success of rail projects that used Chinese labor in Peru, Cuba, and the United States. Asians represent less than 0.5% of the Costa Rican population, mostly from China, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nThere are also over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (in the Central Valley), Matambú or Chorotega (Guanacaste), Maleku (northern Alajuela), Bribri (southern Atlantic), Cabécar (Cordillera de Talamanca), Guaymí (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), Boruca (southern Costa Rica) and Térraba (southern Costa Rica).\n\nA considerable portion of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans. There is also a number of Colombian refugees. Moreover, Costa Rica took in lots of refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s – notably from El Salvador, Chile, Argentina, Cuba and recently from Venezuela.\n\nCurrently immigrants represent 9% of the Costa Rican population, the largest in Central America and the Caribbean. By 2014 the three largest Immigrant Diasporas in Costa Rica are people from: Nicaragua, Colombia and United States.\n\nApproximately 40% live in rural areas and 60% in urban areas. The rate of urbanization estimated for the period 2005–2010 is 2.3% per annum, one of the highest among developing countries.\n\nThe primary language spoken in Costa Rica is Costa Rican Spanish, one of the main particularities of the Costa Rica Spanish is the usage of the second person singular pronoun \"vos (called voseo) or usted\" instead of \"tu\". Some native languages are still spoken in indigenous reservations. The most numerically important are the Bribri, Maléku, Cabécar and Ngäbere languages, some of which have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica – others a few hundred. Some languages, such as Teribe and Boruca, have fewer than a thousand speakers. A Creole-English language, Jamaican patois (also known as Mekatelyu), is spoken along the Caribbean coast. About 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks English, 0.7% French, and 0.3% speaks Portuguese or German as a second language. Mennonite immigrants to the country also speak Plautdietsch.\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion, and Roman Catholicism is the official state religion according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nAccording to the most recent nationwide survey of religion, conducted in 2007 by the University of Costa Rica, 70.5% of Costa Ricans are Roman Catholics, 44.9% of the population are practicing Catholics, 13.8% are evangelical Protestants, 11.3% report they do not have a religion, and 4.3% belonged to another.\n\nBecause of the recent small but continuous immigration from Asia and the Middle East, other religions have grown, the most popular being Buddhism (because of a growing Han Chinese community of 40,000), and smaller numbers of Hindu, Jewish, Bahá’í, and Muslim adherents.\n\nThe Sinagoga Shaarei Zion synagogue is near La Sabana Metropolitan Park in San José. Several homes in the neighborhood east of the park display the Star of David and other Jewish symbols.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) claim more than 35,000 members, and has a temple in San Jose that served as a regional worship center for Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras. However, they represent less than one percent of the population.\n\nCosta Rica's emigration is the smallest in the Caribbean Basin and is among the smallest in the Americas. By 2015 about just 133,185 (2,77%) of the country's people live in another country as immigrants. The main destination countries are the United States (85,924), Nicaragua (10,772), Panama (7,760), Canada (5,039), Spain (3,339), Mexico (2,464), Germany (1,891), Italy (1,508), Guatemala (1,162) and Venezuela (1,127). In 2005, there were 127,061 Costa Ricans living in another country as immigrants. Remittances were $513,000,000 in 2006 and they represented 2.3% of the country's GDP.\n\nCosta Rica's immigration is among the largest in the Caribbean Basin. Immigrants in Costa Rica represent about 10.2% of the Costa Rican population. The main countries of origin are Nicaragua, Colombia, United States and El Salvador. In 2005, there were 440,957 people in the country living as immigrants. Outward Remittances were $246,000,000 in 2006.\n\n"}

{"id": "252113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=252113", "title": "Don Juan", "text": "Don Juan\n\nDon Juan (Spanish ), also Don Giovanni (Italian), is a legendary, fictional libertine. The first written version of the \"Don Juan\" legend was written by the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina (\"nom de plume\" of Gabriel Téllez). His play, \"El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra\" (\"The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest\"), was set in the fourteenth century and published in Spain around 1630. The name \"Don Juan\" is a common metaphor for a womanizer.\n\nThe original play was written in the Spanish Golden Age according to its beliefs and ideals, but as the story was translated and time passed, the story was adapted to accommodate cultural changes.\n\nTirso de Molina wrote \"El burlador de Sevilla\" in 1630 in order to demonstrate a life-changing lesson. He saw that everyone was throwing his life away, living and sinning as they pleased, because they believed that in the end, as long as they repented before they died, they would receive the grace to enter heaven. However, through his play, he shows that even Don Juan, who is identified as the very devil, a \"man without a name\" and shapeshifter, has to eventually pay for his sins. Tirso reminds us that we must pay for our actions, and that in the end, death makes us all equal.\n\nAlthough the various iterations of the Don Juan myth show some variation, the basic story remains the same. Starting with Tirso's work, Don Juan is portrayed as a wealthy libertine who devotes his life to seducing women, taking great pride in his ability to seduce women of all ages and stations in life.\n\n\"Tan largo me lo fiáis\" (translated as \"What a long term you are giving me!\") is the aphorism that Don Juan lives by. It is his way of indicating that he is young and death is still distant, trusting he has plenty of time to repent for his sins.\n\nHis life is also punctuated with violence and gambling, and in many interpretations (Tirso, Espronceda, Zorrilla), he kills Don Gonzalo, the father of a girl he has seduced, Doña Ana. This leads to the famous last supper scene, whereby Don Juan invites the statue of the father to dinner. The ending depends on which version of the legend one is reading. Tirso's original play was meant as religious parable against Don Juan's sinful ways, and ends with his death, having been denied salvation by God. Other authors and playwrights would interpret the ending in their own fashion. In Da Ponte's libretto for \"Don Giovanni\", he repeatedly refuses to repent despite being given the opportunity by the statue. Espronceda's Don Felix walks into hell and to his death of his own volition, whereas Zorrilla's Don Juan asks for, and receives, a divine pardon. The figure of Don Juan has inspired many modern interpretations.\n\nAlbert Camus utilizes Don Juan as a character to portray certain ideas. In \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", Camus describes Don Juan as an example of an 'absurd hero', as he maintains a reckless abandon in his approach to love. His seductive lifestyle \"brings with it all the faces in the world, and its tremor comes from the fact that it knows itself to be mortal\". He \"multiplies what he cannot unify... It is his way of giving and vivifying\". \n\nDon Juan also fascinated Jane Austen: \"I have seen nobody on the stage who has been a more interesting Character than that compound of Cruelty and Lust\". In a famous passage, Kierkegaard discusses Mozart's version of the Don Juan story. Charles Rosen saw what he called \"the seductive physical power\" of Mozart's music as linked to 18th century libertinism, political fervor, and incipient Romanticism. Anthony Powell in his novel \"Casanova's Chinese Restaurant\" contrasts Don Juan, who \"merely liked power\" and \"obviously did not know what sensuality was\", with Casanova, who \"undoubtedly had his sensuous moments\".\n\nIn Spain, the first three decades of the twentieth century saw more cultural fervor surrounding the Don Juan figure than perhaps any other period. In one of the most provocative pieces to be published, the endocrinologist Gregorio Marañón argued that, far from the paragon of masculinity he was often assumed to be, Don Juan actually suffered from an arrested psychosexual development.\n\nDuring the 1918 influenza epidemic in Spain, the figure of Don Juan served as a metaphor for the flu microbe.\n\nThe Don Juan legend discusses the theological question of the Act of Contrition, through which those who regretted their sins before death, would automatically receive salvation. However, others believed that some sins were unforgivable and that a simple Act of Contrition would not save them from damnation for all the harm they had caused. Tirso de Molina's theological perspective is quite apparent through the message he conveys with the dreadful ending of his play.\n\nSpecifically redefined as masculine honor and feminine integrity. Under the importance of honor, men in this time period found feminine integrity to be a crucial element, to the point where women in the Italian version of Don Juan are devalued. These notions influence Don Juan’s opinions and behavior, leading him to objectify women throughout his life; quantity of women becomes more important to him than social status. He often disguises himself and assumes other identities in order to seduce women. If a woman was not to remain chaste until marriage, her whole family’s honor would be devalued.\n\nDon Juan is first identified as an evil man for his ability to manipulate his language and seduce women, as the devil is known for taking other forms. However, he finally repents of all his wrongdoings.\n\nIn Spanish, \"Don Juan\" is pronounced . The usual English pronunciation is , with two syllables and a silent \"J\". However, in Byron's epic poem it rhymes with \"ruin\" and \"true one\", indicating that it was intended to have the trisyllabic spelling pronunciation . This would have been characteristic of his English literary predecessors who often imposed English pronunciations on Spanish names, such as Don Quixote .\n\nAn English adaptation of Tirso de Molina's play was \"The Libertine\" (1676) by Thomas Shadwell. A revival of this play in 1692 included songs and dramatic scenes with music by Henry Purcell. \n\nAmong the best-known works about this character are Molière's play \"Dom Juan ou le Festin de pierre\" (1665), Goldoni's play \"Don Giovanni Tenorio\" (1735), Byron's epic poem \"Don Juan\" (1821), José de Espronceda's poem \"El estudiante de Salamanca\" (1840), and José Zorrilla's play \"Don Juan Tenorio\" (1844). Along with \"Don Juan Tenorio\" (still performed every November 2 throughout the Spanish-speaking world), \"Don Giovanni\", an opera composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, is arguably the best-known version. First performed in Prague in 1787, it inspired works by E. T. A. Hoffmann, Alexander Pushkin, Søren Kierkegaard, George Bernard Shaw and Albert Camus.\n\n\"Don Juans Ende\", a play derived from an unfinished 1844 retelling of the tale by poet Nikolaus Lenau, inspired Richard Strauss' orchestral tone poem \"Don Juan\", Op. 20, which premiered on November 11, 1889, in Weimar, where Strauss served as Court Kapellmeister and conducted the orchestra of the Weimar Opera. In Lenau's rendering, Don Juan's promiscuity springs from his determination to find the ideal woman. Despairing of ever finding her, he ultimately surrenders to melancholy and wills his own death.\n\nIn 1901, Finnish composer Jean Sibelius wrote the second movement of his second symphony based on the climax of Don Juan. The piece begins with a representation of Death walking up the road to Don Juan's house, where Don Juan pleads with Death to let him live.\n\nSwedish film director Ingmar Bergman wrote and directed a comic sequel in 1960 titled \"The Devil's Eye\" in which Don Juan, accompanied by his servant, is sent from Hell to contemporary Sweden to seduce a young woman before her marriage.\n\nDon Juan is also mentioned in the musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's \"Les Miserables\", in which the character Grantaire states that Marius Pontmercy is acting like Don Juan.\n\nAlso in Gaston Leroux's \"The Phantom of the Opera\", the Phantom writes an opera based on the legend of Don Juan called \"Don Juan Triumphant\".\n\nErrol Flynn stars as a swashbuckling lover of women who also fights on the side of a good Spanish queen (Viveca Lindfors) against the forces of evil in the film \"The Adventures of Don Juan\" (1948).\n\nIn 1971, Gunta Virkava and Juhan Ulfsak starred in Estonian film version \"Don Juan in Tallinn\" based on Samuil Aljošin play. In this version, Don Juan is a woman dressed in men's clothes and is accompanied by her servant Florestino in their adventure in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. \n\nIn 1995, Johnny Depp and Marlon Brando starred in the film \"Don Juan DeMarco\", in which Depp plays the title role, a mental patient convinced he is Don Juan, and who retells his life story to the psychiatrist played by Brando.\n\nThe film \"Don Jon\" (2013) and its womanizing protagonist is a reference to Don Juan.\n\n\n"}

She was murdered in a former psychiatric institution at Sonnenstein castle in Pirna under Action T4, a forced euthanasia program of Nazi Germany. Since 2000, a memorial center for the T4 program in the house commemorates her life and work in a permanent exhibition.\n\nElfriede Lohse-Wächtler grew up in a middle-class family, but left at the age of 16 to study at the Royal Arts School Dresden from 1915 to 1918 (fashion, then applied graphics). From 1916 to 1919, she also attended drawing and painting courses at the Dresden Art Academy. She came into contact with the Dresden Secession Group 1919 and became part of the circle of friends around Otto Dix, Otto Griebel, and Conrad Felixmüller. Renting part of the studio of the latter near the Dresden city center she made a living with batiks, postcards and illustrations.\n\nIn June 1921, she married the painter and opera singer , following him to Görlitz in 1922 and in 1925 to Hamburg. The marriage was a difficult one and the couple separated several times in the following years. In 1926, Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler joined the \"Federation of female Hamburgian artists and art lovers\"; in 1928. she was able to participate in some exhibitions of the New Objectivity.\n\nIn 1929, she suffered a nervous breakdown because of financial and partnership difficulties and was committed to a psychiatric institution in Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. During the two months' stay she painted the \"Friedrichsberg heads\", a piece of work consisting of about 60 drawings and pastels, mainly portraits of fellow patients. After her recovery and a final separation from Kurt Lohse (in 1926), she had a very creative phase. She painted numerous paintings of Hamburg's harbor, scenes from the life of workers and prostitutes, and pitiless self-portraits. But despite some exhibitions, sales, and smaller grants, she lived in grinding poverty.\n\nDue to financial problems and increasing social isolation, she returned to her parents' home in Dresden by midyear 1931. When her mental state worsened her father admitted her to the state mental home at Arnsdorf in 1932. There she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. From 1932 to 1935 she was still creatively active, drawing portraits and creating arts and crafts. After Kurt Lohse divorced her in May 1935 she was incapacitated due to \"incurable insanity\".\n\nAfter refusing to consent to a sterilisation, she was denied the permission to go out of the hospital any more. In December 1935, she underwent a forced surgical sterilisation in the Dresden-Friedrichstadt women's hospital on the grounds of Nazi eugenicist policies. After this traumatic event she never painted again. In 1940 she was deported to the former psychiatric institution at Pirna-Sonnenstein (located in the Sonnenstein castle in Pirna), where, on 31 July, she was murdered along with the majority of the other residents as part of the Nazi \"euthanasia\" program, Action T4. The official cause of death was \"pneumonia with myocardial insufficiency\". In the years of 1940 and 1941, a total of 13,720 mainly mentally ill or handicapped people were gassed by Nazis in this institution formerly well known for its humanistic traditions.\n\nHer most creative period falls within the time of her stay in Hamburg. From 1927 to 1931, she painted some of her major works. The portraits of mentally ill people she drew in Hamburg-Friedrichsberg (1929) and Arnsdorf (1932–1935) have attracted much interest. As part of the \"degenerate art\" campaign by the Nazis nine of her works from the art museum Hamburger Kunsthalle and the Altonaer Museum were confiscated and presumably destroyed in 1937, as well as a large part of her paintings from Arnsdorf.\n\nRenewed interest in Lohse-Wächtler started with a presentation of some of her paintings in Reinbek near Hamburg. In 1994, an association for the promotion of the works of Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler was founded (\"Förderkreis Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler\"). 1996 saw the publication of the first monograph on her works, written by Georg Reinhardt. This and the exhibitions in Dresden, Hamburg-Altona and Aschaffenburg marked the beginning of a broader reception of the artist's work and fate.\n\nIn 1999, there was a stele erected in memory of her at the Saxon Hospital in Arnsdorf and a ward house named after her. In Pirna-Sonnenstein, a street was dedicated to her in 2005, and since 2008, a street in Arnsdorf also carries her name. At the former hospital site in Friedrichsberg (Hamburg-Barmbek-Süd), a rose garden with a commemorative plaque was designed for her in 2004. In the development area close by, another street was also given her name.\n\nThese were some of the most important expositions on the work of Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler:\n\n\nThese are some of the most important works on Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler (all of them in German).

In the course of his career he was known by increasingly elevated titles as he rose through military ranks, including Enver Efendi (), Enver Bey (), and finally Enver Pasha, \"pasha\" being the honorary title Ottoman military officers gained on promotion to the rank of Mirliva (major general).\n\nAfter the Ottoman coup d’état of January 1913, Enver Pasha became (4 January 1914) the Minister of War of the Ottoman Empire, forming one-third of the triumvirate known as the \"Three Pashas\" (along with Talaat Pasha and Djemal Pasha) who held \"de facto\" rule over the Empire from 1913 until the end of World War I in 1918. As war minister and \"de facto\" Commander-in-Chief (despite his role as the \"de jure\" Deputy Commander-in-Chief, as the Sultan formally held the title), Enver Pasha was the most powerful figure of the government of the Ottoman Empire. He decided to involve the Empire in World War I on the side of Germany. Along with Talaat and Djemal, he was one of the principal perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide and thus is held responsible for the death of between 800,000 and 1,800,000 Armenians.\n\nPrior to World War I, he was hailed at home as \"the hero of the revolution\", and Europeans often spoke of Ottoman Turkey as \"Enverland\". He was a strong proponent of Pan-Turkism.\n\nEnver was born in Istanbul on 22 November 1881. Enver's father, Ahmed ( 1860–1947), was a Gagauz Turk either a bridge-keeper in Monastir or a small town public prosecutor in the Balkans and his mother Ayşe, an Albanian. His uncle was Halil Pasha (later Kut). Enver had two younger brothers, Nuri and Mehmed Kamil, and two younger sisters, Hasene and Mediha. He studied for different degrees in military schools in the empire and ultimately graduated from the \"Harp Akademisi\" with distinction in 1903. He became a major general in 1906. He was sent to the Third Army, which was stationed in Salonica. During his service in the city, he became a member of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP).\n\nIn 1908, the Young Turk Revolution broke out in Salonica, and the young Enver quickly became one of its military leaders. The successful revolt brought the CUP to power, ushering in the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. During the course of the next year, a reactionary conspiracy to organize a countercoup culminated in the \"31 March Incident\", which was put down. Enver Bey took an active role in the suppression of the countercoup. Afterwards, he was sent to Berlin as a military attaché, where he grew to admire the German military culture and strengthened the military ties between Germany and the Ottoman Empire, inviting German officers to reform the Ottoman Army.\n\nIn 1911, Italy launched an invasion of the Ottoman vilayet of Tripolitania (\"Trablus-i Garb\", modern Libya), starting the Italo-Turkish War. Enver decided to join the defense of the province and left Berlin for Libya. There, he assumed the overall command after successfully mobilizing 20,000 troops. Because of the outbreak of the Balkan Wars, however, Enver and other Ottoman generals in Libya were called back to Istanbul. This allowed Italy to take control of Libya. In 1912, thanks to his active role in the war, he was made lieutenant colonel.\n\nHowever, the loss of Libya cost the CUP in popularity, and it fell from government after rigging the 1912 elections (known as the \"Sopalı Seçimler\", \"Election of Clubs\"), to be replaced by the Liberal Union party (which was helped by its military arm, the Savior Officers, that denounced the CUP's actions during the 1912 elections). The defeated CUP assumed an ideology favoring more centralization under Enver.\n\nIn October 1912, the First Balkan War broke out, where the Ottoman armies suffered severe defeats at the hands of the Balkan League. These military reversals weakened the government, and gave Enver his chance to grab for power from the Liberal Union. In a coup in January 1913, he returned power to the CUP from the Liberal Union and introduced a triumvirate that came to be called the \"Three Pashas\" (Enver Pasha, Talaat Pasha, and Djemal Pasha). He took the office as Minister of War. In 1914, he was again Minister of War in the cabinet of Said Halim Pasha, and married HIH Princess Emine Naciye Sultan (1898–1957), the daughter of Prince Süleyman, thus entering the royal family as a damat (\"bridesgroom\" to the ruling House of Osman). His power grew steadily while Europe marched towards total war. He then left the peace negotiations then under way in London. The renewed hostilities only worsened the Empire's situation, however, as the two major remaining strongholds of Adrianople (Edirne) and Yannina fell to the Bulgarians and the Greeks, respectively, forcing the Ottomans to concede defeat at the Treaty of London.\n\nIn June 1913, however, the Second Balkan War broke out between the Balkan Allies. Enver Bey took advantage of the situation and led an army into Eastern Thrace, recovering Adrianople from the Bulgarians, who had concentrated their forces against the Serbs and Greeks. After this success, Enver Bey became a Pasha, and recognised by some Turks as the \"conqueror of Edirne\".\n\nEnver Pasha was an architect of the Ottoman-German Alliance, and expected a quick victory in the war that would benefit the Ottoman Empire. Without informing the other members of the Cabinet, he allowed the two German warships SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau, under the command of German admiral Wilhelm Souchon, to enter the Dardanelles to escape British pursuit; the subsequent \"donation\" of the ships to the neutral Ottomans worked powerfully in Germany's favor, despite French and Russian diplomacy to keep the Ottoman Empire out of the war. Finally on 29 October, the point of no return was reached when Admiral Souchon, now Commander-in-Chief of the Ottoman navy, took \"Goeben\", \"Breslau\", and a squadron of Ottoman warships into the Black Sea and raided the Russian ports of Odessa, Sevastopol, and Theodosia. Russia declared war on Ottoman Empire on 2 November, and Britain followed suit on 5 November. Most of the Turkish cabinet members and CUP leaders were against such a rushed entry to the war, but Enver Pasha held that it was the right course of action.\n\nAs soon as the war started, 31 October 1914, Enver ordered that all men of military age report to army recruiting offices. The offices were unable to handle the vast flood of men, and long delays occurred. This had the effect of ruining the crop harvest for that year.\n\nAfter taking office in 1913, Enver proved ineffective as War Minister, and frequently over the next four years, the Germans had to support the Ottoman government with generals such as Otto Liman von Sanders, Erich von Falkenhayn, Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, and Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein. The Germans also gave the Ottoman government military supplies and fuel.\n\nEnver Pasha's message to the army and the people was \"war until final victory\". During the war, living conditions deteriorated rapidly, and discontent grew. Enver would remain War Minister until he fled the country in 1918.\n\nEnver Pasha assumed command of the Ottoman forces arrayed against the Russians in the Caucasus theatre. He wanted to encircle the Russians, force them out of Ottoman territory, and take back Kars and Batumi, which had been ceded after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. Enver thought of himself as a great military leader, while the German military adviser, Liman von Sanders, thought of him as incompetent. Enver ordered a complex attack on the Russians, placed himself in personal control of the Third Army, and was utterly defeated at the Battle of Sarikamish in December 1914 – January 1915. His strategy seemed feasible on paper, but he had ignored external conditions, such as the terrain and the weather. Enver's army (90,000 men) was defeated by the Russian force (100,000 men), and in the subsequent retreat, tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers died. This was the single worst Ottoman defeat of World War I. On his return to Constantinople, Enver Pasha blamed his failure on his Armenian soldiers, although in January 1915, an Armenian named Hovannes had saved his life during a battle by carrying Enver through battle lines on his back. Nonetheless, Ismail Pasha later initiated the deportations and sporadic massacres of Western Armenians, culminating in the Armenian Genocide.\n\nAfter his defeat at Sarıkamısh, Enver returned to Istanbul (Constantinople) and took command of the Turkish forces around the capital. He was confident that the capital was safe from any Allied attacks. The British and French were planning on forcing the approaches to Constantinople in the hope of knocking the Ottomans out of the war. A large Allied fleet assembled and staged an attack on the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915. The attack (the forerunner to the failed Gallipoli campaign) was a disaster, resulting in the loss of several ships. As a result, Enver turned over command to Liman von Sanders, who led the successful defence of Gallipoli, along with Mustafa Kemal. Enver then left to attend to pressing concerns on the Caucasus Front. Later, after many towns on the peninsula had been destroyed and women and children killed by the Allied bombardment, Enver proposed setting up a concentration camp for the remaining French and British citizens in the empire. Henry Morgenthau, the American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, convinced Enver not to go through with this plan.\n\nEnver’s plan for Falkenhayn’s Yildirim Army Group was to retake Baghdad, recently taken by Maude. This was nearly impossible for logistical reasons. Turkish troops were deserting freely, and when Enver visited Beirut in June 1917, soldiers were forbidden to be stationed along his route for fear that he would be assassinated. Lack of rolling stock meant that troops were often detrained at Damascus and marched south.\n\nDuring 1917, due to the Russian Revolution and subsequent Civil War, the Russian army in the Caucasus had ceased to exist. At the same time, the Committee of Union and Progress managed to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks with the signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (1 January 1918). Enver looked for victory when Russia withdrew from the Caucasus region. When Enver discussed his plans for taking over southern Russia, he ordered the creation of a new military force called the Army of Islam which would have no German officers. Enver's Army of Islam avoided Georgia and marched through Azerbaijan. The Third Army under Vehib Pasha was also moving forward to pre-war borders and towards the First Republic of Armenia, which formed the frontline in the Caucasus. General Tovmas Nazarbekian was the commander on the Caucasus front, and Andranik Ozanian took the command of Armenia within the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman advance was halted at the Battle of Sardarabad.\n\nThe Army of Islam, under the control of Nuri Pasha, moved forward and attacked Australian, New Zealand, British, and Canadian troops led by General Lionel Charles Dunsterville at Baku. General Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on 14 September, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran; most of the Armenian population escaped with British forces. The Ottomans and their Azerbaijani allies, after the Battle of Baku, entered the city on 15 September.\n\nHowever, after the Armistice of Mudros between Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire on 30 October, Ottoman troops were obliged to withdraw and replaced by the Triple Entente. These conquests in the Caucasus counted for very little in the war as a whole but they did however ensure that Baku remained within the boundaries of Azerbaijan while a part of Soviets and later as an independent nation.\n\nFaced with defeat, the Sultan dismissed Enver from his post as War Minister on 4 October 1918, while the rest of Talaat Pasha's government resigned on 14 October 1918. On 30 October 1918, the Ottoman Empire capitulated by signing the Armistice of Mudros. Two days later, the \"Three Pashas\" all fled into exile. On 1 January 1919, the new government expelled Enver Pasha from the army. He was tried \"in absentia\" in the Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20 for crimes of \"plunging the country into war without a legitimate reason, forced deportation of Armenians and leaving the country without permission\" and condemned to death.\n\nEnver first went to Germany, where he communicated and worked with German Communist figures like Karl Radek. In April 1919, Enver left for Moscow in order to serve as a secret envoy for his friend General Hans von Seeckt who wished for a German-Soviet alliance. In August 1920, Enver sent Seeckt a letter in which he offered on behalf of the Soviet Union the partition of Poland in return for German arms deliveries to Soviet Russia. Besides working for General von Seeckt, Enver envisioned cooperation between the new Soviet Russian government against the British, and went to Moscow. There he was well-received, and established contacts with representatives from Central Asia and other exiled CUP members as the director of the Soviet Government’s Asiatic Department. He also met with Bolshevik leaders, including Lenin. He tried to support the Turkish national movement and corresponded with Mustafa Kemal, giving him the guarantee that he did not intend to intervene in the movement in Anatolia. Between 1 and 8 September 1920, he was in Baku for the \"Congress of Eastern Peoples\", representing Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. His appearance was a personal triumph, but the congress failed in its aim to create a mass pro-Bolshevik movement among Moslems. Victor Serge, a witness, recorded that:\n\nMuch has been written about the poor relations between Enver and Mustafa Kemal, two men who played pivotal roles in the Turkish history of the 20th century. Both hailed from the Balkans, and the two served together in North Africa during the wars preceding World War I, Enver being Mustafa Kemal's senior. Enver disliked Mustafa Kemal for his circumspect attitude toward the political agenda pursued by his Committee of Union and Progress, and regarded him as a serious rival. Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk) considered Enver to be a dangerous figure who might lead the country to ruin; he criticized Enver and his colleagues for their policies and their involvement of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. In the years of upheaval that followed the Armistice of October 1918, when Mustafa Kemal led the Turkish resistance to occupying and invading forces, Enver sought to return from exile, but his attempts to do so and join the military effort were blocked by the Ankara government under Mustafa Kemal.\n\nOn 30 July 1921, with the Turkish War of Independence in full swing, Enver decided to return to Anatolia. He went to Batum to be close to the new border. However, Mustafa Kemal did not want him among the Turkish revolutionaries. Mustafa Kemal had stopped all friendly ties with Enver Pasha and the CUP as early as 1912, and he explicitly rejected the pan-Turkic ideas and what Mustafa Kemal perceived as Enver Pasha’s utopian goals. Enver Pasha changed his plans and traveled to Moscow where he managed to win the trust of the Soviet authorities. In November 1921 he was sent by Lenin to Bukhara in the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to help suppress the Basmachi Revolt against the local pro-Moscow Bolshevik regime. Instead, however, he made secret contacts with some of the rebellion’s leaders and, along with a small number of followers, defected to the \"basmachi\" side. His aim was to unite the numerous basmachi groups under his own command and mount a co-ordinated offensive against the Bolsheviks in order to realize his pan-Turkic dreams. After a number of successful military operations he managed to establish himself as the rebels’ supreme commander, and turned their disorganized forces into a small but well-drilled army. His command structure was built along German lines and his staff included a number of experienced Turkish officers.\n\nFrom :\nOn 4 August 1922, as he allowed his troops to celebrate the Kurban Bayramı (Eid al-Adha) holiday while retaining a guard of 30 men at his headquarters near the village of Ab-i-Derya near Dushanbe, the Red Army Bashkir cavalry brigade under the command of Yakov Melkumov (Hakob Melkumian) launched a surprise attack. According to some sources, Enver and some 25 of his men mounted their horses and charged the approaching troops, when Enver was killed by machine-gun fire. In his memoirs, Enver Pasha’s aide Yaver Suphi Bey stated that Enver Pasha died of a bullet wound right above his heart during a cavalry charge. Alternatively, according to Melkumov’s memoirs, Enver managed to escape on horseback and hid for four days in the village of Chaghan. His hideout was located after a Red Army officer infiltrated the village in disguise. Melkumov’s troops then stormed Chaghan, and in the ensuing combat Enver was killed by Melkumov himself.\nFrom :\nEnver’s body was buried near Ab-i-Derya. In 1996, his remains were brought to Turkey and reburied at Abide-i Hürriyet (Monument of Liberty) cemetery in Şişli, Istanbul. Enver’s image remains controversial in Turkey, since there are those who blame him for the Ottoman entrance into World War I and the subsequent collapse of the Empire.\n\nAfter Enver’s death, three of his four siblings, Nuri (1889–1949), Mehmed Kamil (1900–62), and Hasene Hanım, adopted the surname \"Killigil\" after the 1934 Surname Law required all Turkish citizens to adopt a surname.\n\nEnver’s sister Hasene Hanım married Nazım Bey. Nazım Bey, an aid-de-camp of Abdul Hamid II, survived an assassination attempt during the 1908 Young Turk Revolution of which his brother-in-law Enver was a leader. With Nazım, Hasene gave birth to (1910–2000), who would become a famous Turkish film director and producer.\n\nEnver’s other sister, Mediha Hanım (later Mediha Orbay; 1895–1983), married Kâzım Orbay, a prominent Turkish general and politician. On 16 October 1945, their son Haşmet Orbay, Enver's nephew, shot and killed a physician named Neşet Naci Arzan, an event known as the \"\". At the urging of the Governor of Ankara, Nevzat Tandoğan, Haşmet Orbay's friend Reşit Mercan initially took the blame. After a second trial revealed Haşmet Orbay as the perpetrator, however, he was convicted. The murder became a political scandal in Turkey after the suicide of Tandoğan, the suspicious death of the case’s public prosecutor , and the resignation of Kâzım Orbay from his position as Chief of the General Staff of Turkey after his son’s conviction.\n\nBy his marriage to Emine Naciye Sultan, a granddaughter of sultan Abdülmecid I, Enver had:\n\nHis widow remarried his brother Mehmed Kamil Killigil (1900–1962) in 1923, and had one daughter: \n\n\n\n"}

Lagarde, in turn, sent the list to governments whose citizens were on the list.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, Falciani was indicted in absentia by the Swiss federal government for violating the country's bank secrecy laws and for industrial espionage. The indictment accused Falciani of stealing information from HSBC's Geneva offices and passing it on to tax authorities in France. HSBC had been indicted in France for money laundering in November 2014. In November 2015, Switzerland’s federal court sentenced Falciani to five years in prisonthe \"longest sentence ever demanded by the confederation’s public ministry in a case of banking data theft\". Falciani was accused of \"aggravated financial espionage, data theft and violation of commercial and banking secrecy\".\n\nAfter studying at the Sophia Antipolis technology park, Falciani became a computer engineer at the Swiss branch of HSBC between 2001 and 2008. In 2006, he reorganized the database of the organization to improve its security. Falciani has declared that he realized that the way data was managed at HSBC fostered tax evasion, and proposed a new system, which was rejected by his superiors. After the HSBC reaction, and because he believed that \"it is a systematic violation of fundamental rights of citizens by subtracting funds that should be allocated to the general interest\", for two years Falciani collected evidence of potential tax fraud involving 130,000 individuals. Falciani tried to make the information available to the Swiss judicial authorities, but was unsuccessful. This claim was corroborated by French prosecutors.\n\nIn 2008, Falciani made a trip to Beirut and, using a false identity, attempted to sell what he claimed was private client information from a Swiss bank to Bank Audi. Falciani claims that he did this in order to intentionally activate an internal alarm system available to Swiss banking employers, the Swiss Bankers Association (Swissbanking), and which is monitored by the police. He hoped this would allow Swiss prosecutors to become aware of HSBC's criminal activities. In their prosecution against him, however, Swiss authorities claimed that he went to Beirut with the intention of selling the data for profit. In either case, an alarm was indeed set off after a woman reported that a man calling himself Ruben al-Chidiak had attempted to sell her the private data. Falciani says he paid for the airline tickets from his own HSBC account so that authorities could track him.\n\nOn 22 December 2008, Falciani was arrested, questioned and released. On release, Falciani travelled to France where he was arrested in January 2009, forcing the Swiss judiciary to issue an international arrest warrant for him. Switzerland called on France to search his home and to seize the laptop used to send the files. After searching the address, the prosecutor of Nice, Eric de Montgolfier, opened his own investigation, not against Falciani, but against alleged tax fraudsters appearing in the list. The so-called Falciani list remains in France. An international collaboration began with various judicial authorities and remains ongoing. The Falciani list created a diplomatic incident between Switzerland and France. The latter finally agreed to return the data, but only after the contents had been examined. Afterwards Falciani fled to Spain on the advice of the U.S. government because \"it would be easy for someone to pay\" to try to kill him. Upon arrival, he was arrested in Barcelona in July 2012, due to the Swiss international warrant.\n\nHe was jailed at Valdemoro prison (Madrid), waiting for the Audiencia Nacional to decide on his extradition to Switzerland. On 18 December 2012, the Audiencia Nacional released him provisionally. It was in maximum security conditions: eight bodyguards and bulletproof vest. After that Falciani hid in Spain under a system of maximum security protection sponsored by the UN. Finally, on 8 May 2013, Falciani was released. The Audiencia Nacional, given the ongoing collaboration between Spanish and French courts, decided not to extradite Falciani, the reason being that he had provided information indicative of \"severely irregular\" suspicious activity, and of illegal and criminal offenses. He was released because in Spain there is no legal concept of bank secrecy, and information technology trade secrets can not be used to hide unlawful activities. In April 2014, Falciani was called to assist the Argentine federal taxation agency (AFIP) in the fight against money laundering.\n\nFalciani published a book about his experience in the HSBC scandal called \"Séisme sur la planète finance\" (\"Earthquake on Planet Finance\" in English) that was published in April 2015. He lived in Paris for a time, but continued working with Spanish authorities, and stood as a candidate in Spanish elections for the anti-corruption X Party. In April 2018 he was again arrested in Madrid and is currently facing possible extradition to Switzerland, with a decision expected on September 11th.\n\nSpanish high court has rejected the extradition request on the grounds that the Spanish legal code does not recognize ‘aggravated financial espionage’.\n\nHervé Falciani was first in the electoral list of the new Spanish political party Citizen Network X Party for the European elections of 2014. He was elected by citizens in Internet through open lists. Finally the X Party did not obtain any seats.\n\nIn February 2015, it was announced that Falciani will collaborate with the Spanish party Podemos to draft measures against tax evasion for the party's political program.\n\nFalciani claims he was kidnapped by Israeli Mossad agents in Geneva, who were seeking information on bank clients with Hezbollah ties.\n\nFalciani claims that his motives are to repel Switzerland’s \"attack\" on other countries' tax laws and exchequers. HSBC's position is that Falciani is not a whistleblower, that he has instead tried to sell, not release, the stolen data, and only started to cooperate with authorities after being imprisoned in Spain. Regarding this allegation the Audiencia Nacional, a high court in Spain, stated that \"this fact\" (the court's quotation marks in reference to the allegation):\n\nappears somewhat confused and inconsistent with the factual story that we present, which do seem objectively specific episodes of provision of information and effective collaboration with authorities of other states, which indicates a determined attitude of Falciani and not an economic motivation.\n\nFalciani was indicted by Switzerland on 11 December 2014, for violating the country's bank secrecy laws and for industrial espionage. Falciani (who was not named in the indictment, as is customary for Switzerland) was charged with stealing information from HSBC's Geneva offices and passing it on to French tax authorities. The Swiss prosecutors said they were willing to try Falciani in absentia for his alleged crimes.\n\nIn the month prior to his indictment, France had indicted HSBC for money laundering. Falciani had also offered his services to the government of India, which had been investigating money laundering abetted by HSBC. The Swiss government had refused to help the Indian government in its investigation of Indian citizens who were abetted in tax evasion by HSBC on the basis that the information detailing HSBC's alleged transgression was stolen.\n\nIn an interview with the Indian television network NDTV, Falciani said that Switzerland indicted him as part of an \"agenda\" to stifle whistleblowers like himself who have exposed corruption in the Swiss banking industry.\n\n\n"}

Orlandos was born in c. 1770 in Spetses and died in 1852 in Hydra.\n\nIn Hydra, where he had been living since 1811, he married the sister of Georgios and Lazaros Kountouriotis, Hydriote landlords and shipowners. He was also a significant shipowner before the revolution. At the start of it, he gave all his ships to the revolutionary government. He became a delegate from Hydra at the First National Assembly at Epidaurus and a member of the twelve-member committee that modified the text of the first constitution. He had the position of the vice-president of the legislative corps from 13 January until April 1823. On 26 April and after Lazaros Kountouriotis denied the position, he was elected president of the legislative corps. A month later, on 22 May 1823, disappointed from the way politics had taken and anticipating the upcoming civil war, he resigned from his post. His political opponents had already accused him of factionalism due to the assistance he provided to Kountouriotis. In June 1823 he became a member of a committee jointly with Andreas Louriotis and Andreas Zaimis to negotiate about a loan in London. Before departing for the British capital, he wrote a letter about the need of unity and avoidance of civil wars. Also, on November 1823 he visited Lord Byron in Cephalonia. In January 1824, he and Louriotis, a man of Mavrokordatos, were the Greek ambassadors who made the negotiations and finally borrowed the first British loan during the revolution, £800,000. In London they were formally welcomed and they even met the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, George Canning. He was a member of the delegation who, on 1825, summed the second loan, £2,000,000. He returned to Greece on 1825 and continued representing Hydra at the National Assemblies.\n\nOrlandos was a member of the English Party, considering the UK as the most effective country as of helping the revolution. He selected them due to the Kingdom's liberal political heritage and also its superiority in sea. Then he joined the anti-capodistrian faction stating that he preferred Greece a British protectorate instead of tolerating Ioannis Kapodistrias' authoritarian administration. So he took part in the anti-capodistrian demonstrations of Hydra, during the summer of 1831. After all these and in searching for scapegoats to apologise for the loans, he and Louriotis were accused of wrongful administration. They were firstly acquitted but, in 1835 the court characterised them responsible for the loss of £28,769. On 1839 they published their huge apology in two volumes which they later renounced. On 1837 he was one of the founding members of the Archaeological Society of Athens.\n"}
{"id": "657466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657466", "title": "Jack Deveraux", "text": "Jack Deveraux\n\nJack Deveraux is a fictional character from the soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\". He once was the most prominent member of the Johnson family and is most famously played by Matthew Ashford from 1987 to 1993 and from 2001 to 2006, with a few minor breaks in between, in addition to a small guest stint in 2007. After a four-year absence, the character had recently returned to \"Salem\" to reconnect with his estranged family, beginning September 23, 2011. Ashford's return, however, was short-live, as, in April 2012, it was announced that he had been let go from the series, last appearing on August 15, 2012, where he was killed off. Ashford reprised the role for three days, appearing on May 24, 2016, June 20, 2016, August 5, 2016, and August 23, 2016, before making a final appearance on December 21, 2017. \n\nMany of his storylines have included his relationship with Jennifer Horton, which has made up one of one the soap's most popular supercouples. They have two children together, Abigail Deveraux and JJ Deveraux, in addition to a grandson, Thomas DiMera and a granddaughter Charlotte DiMiera, through Abigail. One of the character's well known plots have been his fake deaths which occurred between 2003 and 2006, where he was presumed dead 3 times, which the actor found \"hard to play\" due to being unrealistic.\n\nAt the character's inception in 1987, the role was recast two times, originated first by Joseph Adams from April 10, 1987 to July 17, 1987. Further, James Acheson played the role briefly from July 21, 1987 to October 26, 1987, before Matthew Ashford stepped into the role on October 30, 1987; Ashford notably went on to play the role through October 12, 1993, reappearing from February 5, 2001 to October 27, 2003 and June 22, 2004 until September 21, 2006, with a guest appearance on April 2–4, 2007 and again from September 23, 2011 until August 15, 2012. Ashford later took a brief absence from the series from October 2003 to June 2004 where he would appear as a special guest star on \"One Life to Live\".\n\nAshford was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2012. During Ashford's absence, the role of Jack was played by Mark Valley from October 28, 1994 until September 26, 1997, and by Steve Wilder from September 26, 1997 through June 5, 1998.\n\nOn November 30, 2015, it was announced that Ashford would briefly return to the soap; he appeared on May 24, 2016. Ashford also briefly appeared on June 20, 2016, August 5, 2016, and August 23, 2016. He made another on-off appearance on December 21, 2017. \n\nCharming, manipulative, heroic, clever, selfish, arrogant and self-loathing all at the same time, antihero Jack Deveraux is one half of Jack and Jennifer, one of \"Days of our Lives\" most popular supercouples. Although he entered the story as an outright villain wedging himself violently in between another popular supercouple, Steve Johnson and Kayla Brady, Jack eventually grew to establish himself as a core main character in the \"Days\" mythos through his passion, outrageous sense of humor, redemption, and undying love for heroine Jennifer Horton.\n\nThe character has been a frequent winner of Soap Opera Digest Awards, including Outstanding Villain, multiple wins for Best Love Story (with Jennifer), Best Wedding (also with Jennifer) and Outstanding Comic Performance. Ashford was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2012.\n\nWhen Jack came to Salem, he was seeking treatment for Hodgkin's disease. His father, Harper Deveraux hired Kayla Brady to be Jack's nurse, and when Steve \"Patch\" Johnson rejected her, she agreed to marry him. Unfortunately, the match was doomed. Kayla soon began cheating on Jack with Steve, and when he found out (from the newspaper, of all things), he raped her, and had Steve beaten up. A confrontation resulted in a fall off a roof, and Jack wound up needing a kidney. Unfortunately, the only viable donor was his birth brother, who just happened to be Steve (who only donated the kidney when their mother, Jo, asked him to). Kayla pressed charges (which were later dropped) and filed for divorce.\n\nSometime during this whole fiasco, Jack learned from Melissa Horton, who he had turned to when his marriage had gone sour (not realizing that Harper was trying to frame her for poisoning Kayla), that he was adopted. He turned his back on Harper (who he found out was sterile.) He learned that Jo Johnson was his mother, and Steve and Adrienne his siblings. It was initially hard for him to accept, but Adrienne convinced Jack to at least try, and he made his mother's Christmas when he extended an olive branch...in the form of expensive emerald earrings.\n\nJack ran for his father's seat in the senate against Mickey Horton, Melissa's adoptive father, using her to get to him. When she learned the truth, she dumped him. Then he saw his chance for big money...he helped Victor Kiriakis break Harper out of prison for a portion of his fortune, but the plan went bad, and Harper ended up kidnapping Kayla (again). Steve saved her, and his father went back to jail.\n\nJack bought half the \"Spectator\" to keep them from running a story about him. He attempted to blackmail co-partner Diana Colville into selling her other half. Originally she refused, but he later got his hands on it. The \"Spectator\" is where Jack met college student Jennifer Horton. She was trying to help a homeless pregnant girl named Sally, and the two pretended to be married to give the baby a home. Their fantasy love turned into a real thing, but the return of Jennifer's childhood sweetheart, Emilio, put a wedge between them. When Melissa returned to town, she tried to push Jennifer and Emilio together, and get Jack for herself, but he learned the truth, and kidnapped Jennifer on her wedding day.\n\nJack moved into Steve and Kayla's loft, and was interested to learn that Steve's ex, Marina, was blackmailing him into helping her find the family fortune. He broke a sane Isabella out of the asylum, and found out all about the treasure from her. After getting his hands on the key to the treasure, all he found was Loretta's diary...containing the secret to Isabella's paternity. Before giving her the diary, he removed those pages. Without revealing his identity, her father, Ernesto Toscano, planned a cruise to get revenge on his enemies and get the diary, inviting Jack, who took that opportunity to give Isabella the papers proving that Victor was her father. When a bomb exploded on board the ship, the passengers found their way to an island, where Jack and Jennifer made love. Jennifer agreed to marry Jack, and he was there for her when Ernesto took out himself and Jennifer's cousin Hope Brady (or so they thought...).\n\nWhen Harper returned to town (after having escaped from prison), Jack foiled his plan to kill Steve during his second marriage to Kayla by pushing him off the roof of the bell tower...killing him. His own marriage plans were interrupted when Jennifer stepped in for her high-school chum Katerina von Leuschner (now known as Dr. Carly Manning) and married Lawrence Alamain. When she didn't come back, Jack went looking for her, and ended up in a cell next to Katerina's brother, François, who he later discovered was the Brady's adoptive son, Frankie Brady. The two managed to escape with the help of Lawrence's father, Leopold Alamain (who died in the attempt).\n\nWhen Jack returned to Salem, he hoped to pick up where he left off with Jennifer, and began planning their wedding. When he tried to get romantic with her, she pushed him away, calling him a rapist. He didn't know what was going on, but Jennifer seemed to want nothing to do with him, so he broke it off. When he learned that the \"Spectator\" was in trouble, he married Eve Donovan, who needed a husband to get her hands on Nick Corelli's fortune. Once Eve had her hands on the money, the marriage was annulled, and Jack again tried to get back with Jennifer. After nearly dying when the theme train they were in derailed, Jennifer finally admitted to Jack that she pushed him away because Lawrence had raped her. With Kimberly Brady's help, Jack found a video of Lawrence confessing to the rape, and he was sent to prison.\n\nJack and Jennifer finally married in a wild west show. Honeymooning in Universal Studios, they met Hawk Hawkins, a con man seeking to separate them from their money. With the help of his partner, Desirée, Hawk not only got himself a spot in the Deveraux home (after pretending he threw his back out at their place), but managed to convince Jack the FBI was after him. Jack fled, and Hawk managed to get hold of Jack's fortune. Before Hawk could leave Salem (with Jennifer in tow), Jack returned and convinced Hawk to admit to taking the money. Hawk went to jail, but Jack and Jennifer were still broke.\n\nFinding out Jennifer was pregnant should have been the best moment of Jack's life, but he thought his Hodgkin's had returned, and that he would be leaving a widow with a baby girl. So he sold the \"Spectator\" to Julie Olson Williams, before learning he wasn't dying after all. With no home and no money, they accepted Bill Horton's offer to move into a house he'd owned for years. Abigail Johanna Deveraux was born in a cabin outside of town, and Jack got a job freelancing. When he discovered a journal hidden in the attic of the house, he tried to have it turned into a novel, but Kate Roberts turned him down, and then refused to return the manuscript. Unfortunately, Jack had been counting on that money...he'd stolen some money from Billie Reed (who was holding it for a crime boss) to buy the Spectator back, and had to sell it to Kate...who promptly fired him. When Jack learned shortly after that Abby had aplastic anemia, contracted because he had signed the wrong documents years before resulting in a polluted water well near their home, he decided Jennifer could never forgive him...and left Salem.\n\nJack wasn't seen or heard from for years, until he checked himself into The Meadows (using the name 'Clarke'), and met a woman named 'Monica'. The two realized they had a lot in common, and even became lovers. Imagine Jack's surprise when he found out Monica was none other than Laura Horton, his mother-in-law who had been released from the mental hospital after he'd left town. Jack returned to town and moved into the house like he'd never left...uncomfortable for Jennifer and Peter, but ideal for Jack to get his wife back. He had no idea that his mother-in-law had fallen in love with him.\n\nWhen Peter Blake took Jennifer to his hometown of Aremid, Jack followed them, and befriended a young woman named Sarah, hoping she would help him. She told him all about the woman in white, but once it was discovered that she was dressing like her (she'd fallen in love with Jack), Jennifer and Peter discounted the story. The group returned to Salem, Sarah in tow. Jack hid her, until Peter found out and encouraged her to return to Aremid. After Hope saved her from stripping at the Blue Note, Jack took her back to Aremid. Later, he tried again in Aremid to break up Peter and Jennifer, until Peter revealed that Jack had an affair with Laura (to Laura). Also while in Aremid, Jack found the deed to the Blue Note with Peter's name on it (proving he was involved in his father's criminal activities), but before he could show Jennifer the pavilion caught fire...Jack was saved by Peter in the nick of time. Jennifer discovered Jack's affair with Laura when she walked in on Jack comforting her mother, and married Peter in her devastation (while Jack was in jail for arson, charges that were later dropped).\n\nWhen Tony DiMera was murdered during the wedding reception and John Black the accused, Jack and Jennifer joined forces to prove his innocence. They went undercover at the Blue Moon, but just as they were about to prove Peter and Jude were linked, there was a police bust. Back in Aremid, Jude took Jennifer hostage, and Jack let him go to save Jennifer...who escaped on her own, complete with a matchbook containing the numbers to a bank account in the Cayman Islands. When the two went down there to check it out, Peter magically had the names on the account erased at the very moment they were accessing it. Then they learned that Bo Brady was looking for Hope Brady, who had disappeared, in Aremid, and joined the search. Jack watches Peter shoot Jude in cold blood, but everyone believes that Peter did it in self-defense.\n\nJack followed Peter and Jennifer to Paris, still trying to prove that Peter was dirty. He found some books that could work as proof, but then Peter blew up the tunnels, and Jack and Jennifer barely escaped. Then Jack found Daniel Scott, the man Peter had hired to romance Laura. When Jack agreed to pay his debts (after luring him into a high-stakes poker game), Daniel confessed his dealings with Peter to Jennifer. She wouldn't believe his word alone, but Laura backed her up. After returning to Salem, Peter paid Daniel to tell Jennifer that Jack had bribed him to tell her those lies. Unluckily for Peter, Jennifer went to Daniel on her own, and tricked him into telling her everything. Jack had been planning to leave town until he learned that Jennifer kicked Peter out, and hung around to protect his ex-wife and daughter. He found out Peter was planning to kidnap Jennifer and Abby, but the police couldn't do anything. Jack headed over to the house with a gun, and accidentally killed Peter in a struggle. He was arrested for his murder, and bailed out by Jennifer. Too bad for Jack, Stefano had blackmailed a judge, and Jack was sentenced to life. His cellmate in prison was 'Travis Malloy', a plant from Stefano DiMera. When 'Travis' was released, he moved in next door to Jennifer, as Trent Davis.\n\nThe retrial began, and everyone figured that the charges would be dismissed because Peter was alive. Kristen DiMera even agreed to testify to that fact, but Stefano's presence scared her into silence. He was sent back to prison, and Jennifer got a job there to help him expose the prison system (using Hope's credentials). A crooked guard, T.C., was assigned to Jack and took a liking to Jennifer, even attempting to rape her. Jack saved her by bribing a guard to take him to the warden's office, and was paid back for it with a beating, not knowing Jennifer was hiding in his cell. T.C. and Trent searched Jennifer's home and discovered she was posing as a guard, and Jack's visitors were limited to one person...his lawyer, Mickey Horton. When Stefano decided (as part of a master plan) to become a respected resident of Salem, Jennifer told him that nothing better happen to Jack, because he needed the support of the Hortons. He called T.C. to tell him not to hurt Jack, which came just in time...they were seconds away from killing him. Jack realized that T.C. was on the DiMera bankroll.\n\nJack got himself a new cellmate, Herbie, who used his girlfriend on the outside to sneak Jack the password that Jennifer had stolen for the warden's computer. He used it, and learned that 'Travis' was living next door to Jennifer as Trent Davis. Unfortunately, by the time he got word to Mickey, Trent had kidnapped Jennifer. Finding that out, Herbie helped Jack break out of prison, and he headed to the Grand Canyon to save her. In a fight between Trent and Jack, Trent fell to his death. He and Jennifer returned to Salem to spend Christmas with their family, but Jack snuck away to catch Peter...not realizing that Abby and Jennifer had tagged along. They ended up at a seedy motel, Peter hot on their tail, and ended up being members of the Ward's World Famous Circus, where Jack got a job as an animal keeper. Laura accidentally sent Peter right to them, but luckily, circus owner Jasper saved them.\n\nJack convinced the circus to head to Salem, with a plan to trap Peter, and sent tickets to Hope to get her to come. Unfortunately, Peter had tipped the FBI off to where Jack was hiding, and had him arrested. Jack was heartbroken when Abe came to the jail to tell him that Jennifer's car had crashed, and a dead woman had been found inside...presumed to be Jennifer. Jack was released from jail just long enough to attend Jennifer's funeral. Jack was exonerated of his crimes when Jennifer's 'spirit' convinced Peter to confess to his crimes. Upon returning home, Jack and Abby found a very life Jennifer, who told them about the plan the circus people had to fake her death and resurrection. Jack, Jennifer, and Abby all left Salem in June of 1998 for a vacation in Africa.\n\nWhile in Africa, something went wrong. The two never ended up getting married, and Jennifer ended up tending bar in Ireland. After Bo found her, she returned to Salem. Jack learned from Alice that she had gone to Paris for Greta's coronation, and turned up to try, one last time, to get his wife and daughter back. He has followed Jennifer back to Salem, and the two moved in together so they could look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushed Jack away, and concentrated on relationships with first Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack couldn't resist that certain something that had always been between them. They were remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.\n\nJack and Jennifer were just beginning to enjoy their married life together again, and to enjoy hosting In the House, a show that was one of Jennifer's father Bill Horton's wedding gifts to her and Jack. Then Jennifer was dealt the harshest blow of her life when Jack was struck down in an alley behind Salem Place by the Salem Stalker; however, unbeknownst to everyone in Salem, Jack wasn't really dead -- he'd been kidnapped to a tropical island that was the spitting image of Salem! He tried to escape to make it back to Jennifer, but ended up lost in the jungle surrounding the compound. Luckily Patrick, Jennifer and Hope were also out there in the jungle, and Jack was there just in time to meet his brand new son. While trying to get back to Salem, Jack and Jennifer were separated and Jack was presumed dead again, but ended up in Tony's European castle being held prisoner.\n\nNot one to be down and out, Jack was still determined to get home to Jennifer, and escaped from the DiMera castle, trying to make his way back to Salem. After numerous failed attempts, Jack managed to pair up with Cassie Brady, Marlena Evans and Roman Brady, and the four eventually made it back to Salem. Jack was happy to be home with his wife and children, but he soon began feeling sick, and when he went in to Lexie, she advised him he only had a short period of time to live. Although Lexie and later Marlena tried to convince Jack to tell Jennifer, he was determined to enjoy the time he had left with his family without having them concentrate on his illness.\n\nConvinced it was his job to make sure Jennifer was taken care of after his death, he began pushing Jennifer and Frankie to spend more time together. As soon as he thought the two were close again, Jack faked his death and \"left\" Salem, leaving Jennifer and Frankie to marry.\n\nA few months later he encountered an orderly who looked exactly like his long-lost brother, Steve Johnson. It turned out that the orderly was Steve, and Jack insisted on a DNA test. Jack convinced Steve to return to Salem and reconnect with their family.\n\nJack returned during Jennifer's wedding to Frankie. Because her husband was still alive, Jennifer's marriage was invalid. Wanting Jennifer to be happy, Frankie found a cure for Jack's illness and Jack and Jennifer left for Europe together.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Jennifer returned to Salem to settle Alice Horton's estate. Jack was not with her. Jack had decided to go on a \"walk about\" in Australia to search for himself and find the meaning of life - or so we thought.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, Jack returned to Salem with the real story of where he was for a year. He had been working on a case involving drug trafficking in Europe. He traced the source of the drugs to Afghanistan, lied to Jennifer, Abigail, and JJ Deveraux about where he was going, and snuck into the country. He was soon captured, held prisoner, and tortured. His contact made up the story about the \"walk about\" and kept up that image so that Jack's family would not know about the news story. When Jack was finally released, he returned to Salem to tell everyone the truth. However, Jennifer had already divorced Jack and moved on with Daniel, and Abigail was furious with Jack for lying to the family. Neither was ready to trust Jack again.\n\nAdamant that he had changed and would not lie again, Jack set about getting his family back. But, his first step was to deal with the trauma of being captured and tortured. Jack had developed PTSD. He worked with Marlena and a support group to recover. Eventually, he was able to open up to Jennifer about it.\n\nThis lead to the two of them reconciling and getting engaged. It also paved the way for Abigail and Jack to rebuild their relationship as well. And, Jack took a job teaching journalism at Salem U.\n\nJack and Jennifer supported Abe Carver through Lexie Carver's terminal diagnosis and death. And, after she died, they attended a memorial/autism fundraiser. However, there was a great explosion that night in the tunnels underneath Salem. Many buildings were damaged, including the banquet hall where Lexie's benefit was being held. Abigail was trapped in the elevator.\n\nJennifer, Jack, and Cameron Davis worked to get Abigail out. When they were able to pry the doors open a little, Jack went into the elevator to rescue Abigail. But, the elevator cables continued to break. Cameron and Jennifer were able to open the doors again and Jack pushed Abigail out. Then, the doors closed and the final cables broke. The elevator crashed with Jack inside. Roman reported that the EMTs pronounced Jack dead upon impact.\n\n"}

{"id": "31897509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31897509", "title": "Janis Babson", "text": "Janis Babson\n\nJanis Anne Babson (September 9, 1950 – May 12, 1961) was a Canadian girl who received posthumous acclaim with the donation of her corneas for transplant after her death from leukemia at the age of 10. Her story was reported in a newspaper article syndicated across Canada, inspiring two books and other memorials. When Janis died of leukemia in 1961, corneal transplantation was a relatively unknown procedure. Although parents who lose young children frequently donate some of their organs to others, Janis's bequest was significant because the donation of her eyes at her death was her own idea, and it inspired many other people—across Canada and elsewhere—to become cornea donors as well.\n\nJanis happened to see a television program sponsored by an eye bank after watching \"National Velvet\", a program she loved because of her passion for horses. When her youngest brother fell asleep on her lap, she did not want to wake him and remained in front of the television set when a White Cane Week special aired. The program's hosts explained how some cases of blindness could be cured with corneal donations, restoring a recipient's eyesight. After the program Janis, moved, told her mother and father that when she died she wanted to donate her eyes to the Eye Bank. Her parents—Harry Rudolphe (Rudy) Babson, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Rita Quinn Babson—knew their daughter was serious about the gift, but it was a big decision for such a young girl.\n\nIn early 1959, when Janis was eight years old, her mother noticed that she had lost her energy and appetite. Her father took her to the family pediatrician who noted a great increase in white blood cells from a sample he took. He ordered additional tests and referred her to hematologist Alexander English at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. The tests revealed that Janis was suffering from a sub-acute form of leukemia. At that time, leukemia was invariably fatal; with the chemotherapy available, Janis was expected to live about a year. She responded well to treatments which slowed the advance of the leukemia, and survived about 26 months after her diagnosis.\n\nDespite a change in drugs from methotrexate to mercaptopurine, Janis's condition deteriorated in early 1961 as her leukemia worsened and she was hospitalized and released twice. In early May, she was hospitalized for the third (and final) time. Janis died in her parents' arms at 9:25 pm ET on Friday, May 12, 1961. Throughout her illness, Janis reminded her parents about her desire to donate her eyes; their original reluctance gave way when Rudy signed the consent forms for the donation of Janis's eyes a few hours before her death.\n\nJanis is buried in Notre Dame Cemetery in Ottawa. Her funeral Mass was attended by her entire school.\n\nJanis's best friend, Tricia Kennedy, moved from Ottawa to Chalk River, Ontario with her family. When the Kennedys were interviewed by the local paper as part of a get-to-know-your-neighbours feature, Tricia Kennedy announced that her best friend had died of leukemia and donated her eyes to the Eye Bank in Toronto. Impressed, the reporter then contacted the \"Ottawa Journal\". Tim Burke, a reporter for the \"Journal\", contacted the Babsons; his interview became \"Little Janis\" in his May 31, 1961 \"Below the Hill\" column. The response was immediate: from Ottawa Mayor Charlotte Whitton to retired pharmacist Abe Silver (who created an endowment to Hebrew National University in Janis's name for leukemia research) to groups and individuals who set a record for the number of pledged donations to the Eye Bank.\nIn 1962, the first of two books on Janis's life was published: \"Janis of City View\" (Holy Cross Press) by Rena Ray.

Six months earlier, a condensed version had appeared in the June 1963 issue of \"Reader's Digest\" entitled \"The Triumph of Janis Babson\".\n\nThe Internet has spawned several websites dedicated to Janis Babson's memory. In addition, her family (mother and siblings) have created a memorial Facebook page where many whose lives were touched by Janis's can leave comments and posts. A 50th-anniversary tribute, arranged by the Babson family, was held May 27, 2011, in Ottawa to commemorate a half-century since Janis's death. It featured Lawrence Elliott, a new commemorative edition of \"A Little Girl's Gift\", and artist Caroline Langill (\"Custody of the Eyes\").

He entered the French military engineering school in 1760. He was assigned to America in 1777. On 17 November Laumoy was commissioned Colonel of Engineers; he joined Washington's winter camp at Valley Forge. The French engineers, de Laumoy, La Radiere, and Duportail, provided knowledge of European fortifications and siege warfare.\n\nLaumoy was deployed to the southern operations area on 8 February 1779; he advised Benjamin Lincoln at Charleston to surrender given the inadequate fortifications; he was taken prisoner at the Siege of Charleston (12 May 1780); he was exchanged on 26 November 1782. Laumoy was breveted Brigadier General on 30 September 1783, and honorably discharged from the US Army the following month.\n\nHe returned to France in December 1783. On 4 July 1784 he was awarded the Order of Saint Louis, a distinction his father had also received. On 1 July 1785, Laumoy was made Aide maréchal général des logis at Saint-Domingue. Later, returning to France, he was Mestre de camp on 2 December 1787. For some months in 1788, he served on the army general staff. On 14 February 1789, he was second in command at Martinique, when the French suppressed a rebellion by island's large African slave and ex-slave population. As one of the hated administrators, Laumoy was obliged to return to France in May 1790.\n\nFor a while, Laumoy held a number of staff posts in the French Revolutionary Army. However, along with Lafayette, he was forced to flee in August 1792, and was captured by the Austrians, at Rochefort, Belgium. Upon release, he lived in exile, in Holland, but escaped to America when Napoleon invaded The Netherlands. Laumoy lived in Philadelphia until he was removed from the émigré list. He returned to France in the summer of 1801. He retired in 1810, and died 19 January 1832.\n\n"}

{"id": "3646582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3646582", "title": "Legal name", "text": "Legal name\n\nLegal name is the name that identifies a person for legal, administrative and other official purposes. A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of registration of the birth and which then appears on a birth certificate (see \"birth name\"), but may change subsequently. Most jurisdictions require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a name change to be recorded at marriage. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes his/her first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations).\n\nA person's legal name typically is the same as his/her personal name, comprising a given name and a family name. The order varies according to culture and country. There are also country-by-country differences on changes of legal names by marriage. (See \"married name\".)\n\nMost countries require by law the registration of a name for newborn children, and some can refuse registration of \"undesirable\" names. In 1991, a Swedish couple refused to give their newborn a legal name, in protest of existing naming laws. In 1996, they were fined for not registering a name for their child for five years, after they unsuccessfully tried to register the child's name as Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116, and then as \"A\".\n\nThe \"Civil Code of Quebec\" states that \"Every person exercises his civil rights under the name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth,\" and spouses retain their legal names upon marriage. They can be changed, upon registration, only under prescribed conditions, and only where the person is a Canadian citizen who has been domiciled in Québec for at least one year.\n\nIn Germany, names are regulated to a large extent. Apart from possibly adopting the partner's name upon marriage, German citizens may only change their name for a recognised important reason. Among other reasons, a change of names is permitted when the name can give rise to confusion, ridicule, unusual orthographic difficulties, or stigmatization. In certain situations, children's last names may also be changed to their natural, foster or adoptive parent's last name. Transgender people may change their first names. Foreign names in writing systems that are not based on Latin are transliterated according to rules which may conflict with the system of transcribing or transliterating names that is used in the country of origin. Former titles of nobility became integrated into the last names in 1919 but continue to be adapted according to gender and other circumstances.\n\nIn the UK, businesses that trade under names other than those of the owner or a corporate entity must display the name of owner and an address at which documents may be served, or the name and registered number of the corporate body and its registered address. The requirements apply to sole traders and partnerships, but there are special provisions for large partnerships where listing all partners would be onerous. \n\nThe information must be shown on any trading premises where the public have access to trade and in documents such as order forms, receipts and, as of January 2007, corporate websites (to be extended later in 2007 to sole trader websites).\n\nIn strict English law, if there is such a thing as a \"legal\" surname, it is easily changed. In the words of \"A dictionary of American and English law\", \"Any one may take on himself whatever surname or as many surnames as he pleases, without statutory licence\". This does not always seem to have applied to names given in baptism. As noted by Sir Edward Coke in \"Institutes of the Lawes of England\", \"a man may have divers names at divers times, but not divers Christian names.\" But in modern practice all names are freely changeable.\n\nChanges of name are usually effected through deed poll, optionally enrolled either at the High Court of Justice or at the College of Arms, with a notice recorded in \"The London Gazette\". Changes may also be made by means of a Royal License obtained through the College of Arms, with similar notice. These enrolment, licence and notice procedures are useful for having the new name appear in official documents.\n\nScots Law allows anyone who wishes to do so to change their forename(s) or surname and such changes may be recorded in the official register held by the National Records of Scotland. Technically the Registrar General makes a correction to the entry. A correction can be recorded where a birth has been registered in Scotland, or where a person is the subject in Scotland of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, the Parental Order Register or the Gender Recognition Register. The above formalities are not necessary where a spouse/partner assumes the other spouse/partner's surname upon marriage or civil partnership, or reverts back to their original name upon separation, divorce or dissolution of the civil partnership.\n\nOnly one change of name is allowed in the register where a person has not yet reached the age of 16, and afterwards only one change of forename and three changes of surname may be granted during a person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname. Name changes may also be recorded where:\n\n\nAnyone born or adopted in Northern Ireland is able to change their name with the General Register Office of Northern Ireland in the following circumstances:\n\n\nA deed poll can also be used in Northern Ireland for this purpose.\n\nMost states in the United States follow the common law which permits name changing for non-fraudulent purposes. This is actually the most common method, since most women who marry do not petition a court under the statutorily prescribed method, but simply use a new name (typically the husband's, a custom which started under the theory of coverture where a woman lost her identity and most rights when she married). \n\nMost state courts have held that a legally assumed name (i.e., for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name and usable as their true name, though assumed names are often not considered the person's technically true name.\n\nThe legal name of a business is the name under which the business conducts its operations.\n"}
{"id": "54516135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54516135", "title": "Lin Daoqian", "text": "Lin Daoqian\n\nLin Daoqian (, Malay: Tok Kayan, Thai: ลิ้มโต๊ะเคี่ยม), also written as Lim Toh Khiam and Vintoquián, was a Chinese pirate and trader of Teochew origin. He led pirate attacks along the coast of Guangdong and Fujian, but they were driven to Taiwan by the Ming dynasty navy commanded by Yu Dayou. He later moved to South East Asia where he traded and engaged in piracy. He became established in Patani where he died.\n\nLin was of Teochew origin, and he was described as being from either Chenghai or Huilai in Guangdong. Later he moved to Quanzhou, Fujian. Lin was part of the \"wokou\" piratical activity that plagued the Chinese coast during the reign of the Ming Jiajing Emperor (1522–1566). He attacked Zhao'an in 1563, where he was said to have burnt hundreds of houses killing thousands. In response, the Ming navy led by Yu Dayou drove Lin away first to Penghu islands, later to Beigang, Taiwan. Yu then occupied Penghu, but did not pursue Lin to Taiwan. Lin was said to have stayed in Takau for a while . According to Taiwanese accounts, Lin slaughtered many of the natives in Taiwan, using their blood as caulk for his ships.\n\nLin escaped to Champa, but after another defeat, he went to Luzon in the Philippines. By 1567, he was again raiding along the coast of China, and in 1568, and the Ming authority placed a bounty on Lin in an attempt to capture him. Lin was reported to have 5,000 followers in July 1569. At some point he was said to have been attacked by another pirate chief Lin Feng, who captured 55 of his ships. Ming records state that Lin was \"most crafty and cunning\", and would alternately rebel and swear allegiance to the Ming authority. It was reported in 1573 that he had rebelled, and fled to find sanctuary in a foreign country. He settled in Pulo Condore in 1574.\n\nBy the first half of 1570s, Lin was already operating in the Patani area, and the Ming authority joined force with the Siamese navy as well as using Portuguese ships to combat the pirates. In 1578, he established a base in Patani with 2,000 followers and they would dominate the town for some time. Ming sources indicate that he attacked Siamese ships but was repelled in 1578, and in 1580 he again attacked Siam but also left Siam later that year. The Ming authorities tried to capture him while he continued to launch raids against Chinese ships in 1580–81. After 1581 there were no further reports of his piratical activity in Ming sources, suggesting he had retired from raiding and settled in Patani. He obtained a fief and briefly established a small port near Patani, while members of his band gained prominence in the service of Patani's ruler. According to the local lore of Patani, he married the daughter of the Sultan, converted to Islam and built a mosque. He died in Patani, said to be due to cannon fire while he was testing cannons he had made.\n\nThere are a number of myths and legends about Lin in Taiwan. It was said that while anchored at Takau, Taiwan in 1563, Lin placed his treasure into eighteen and a half bamboo baskets, hiding them in the surrounding hills, and the Takau Hill then acquired an alternate name Buried-Gold Hill (埋金山). Another story goes that Lin was told by a Taoist master that he would be able to conquer all of China if, after he had performed certain tasks in a hundred days, he fired three arrows towards Beijing on the dawn of the last day. The master gave him 3 magic arrows and a \"divine rooster\". Lin handed the rooster in the care of his sister Jin-lien (金蓮). On the midnight of last day, Jin-lien inadvertently startled the rooster, causing it to crow. Lin awoke and mistakenly thought that dawn had arrived, immediately firing off three divine arrows with his name towards the imperial capital. The three arrows flew into the imperial palace, striking the dragon throne. However, as it was midnight, the throne was empty. The emperor found the three arrows with Lin's name on them stuck in his throne, realizing that Lin had attempted to kill him, then ordered his troops to attack Lin.\n\nThe Teochew people of Thailand tell a number of stories about Lin. In one, he was said to have helped the Siamese fight off an Annam attack and was thus given the daughter of the king to marry; however, he later angered the king after making a joke about killing the king, and had to flee. Another story involves the legend of Lin Guniang (Lim Ko Niao), said to be his sister in this account. Lin Guniang tried to persuade her brother to return to China with her after finding that her brother had married a local woman, converted to Islam as well as building a mosque in Kru Se, Patani. However he refused, fought and defeated her, and she then committed suicide by hanging from a tree. Her gravestone, located next to the Krue Se Mosque, is said to have been built by her brother. A shrine in her name exists in Patani and she is worshipped by some Chinese people in southern Thailand.\n\nAccording to \"Phongsawadan muang pattani\" (Chronicle of Pattani), he attempted to cast three bronze cannons to be used in the wars of Patani. After several failures with the third cannon, he offered to sacrifice himself should his attempt be successful, and was blown up while testing the third cannon. A 19th century Chinese account claims that the ruler of Patani was his descendant.\n\nIt is thought that Lin's activity in the area may have influenced the migration of Teochew people to Thailand in later years. A Dutch merchant Olivier van Noort described a group of traders from Patani he met in Brunei in 1601 as being Chinese enough to have their own king and used the same laws as in China. Another Dutch report of 1603 by Jacob van Neck estimated that there may be as many Chinese in Patani as there were native Malays. Many Malays in Kru Se, Patani claim descent from Lin, although they may have been descendants of his followers who married local women.\n"}

His parents were Narciso Gregorio and Canuta Valladolid (some sources spell his mother's name as \"Balladolid\"). At an early age he learned to play the violin and was soon recognized for his talent. He subsequently learned to play other instruments such as the bandurria, the guitar, and piano. Later he started writing music for the local church by himself or in collaboration with his older brother Bernardo who organized the local band Banda de Lib-og. Potenciano later became the bandmaster of the same band until he joined the Philippine Constabulary Band in 1919.\n\nIt is claimed that Potenciano Gregorio composed \"Sarung Banggi\" when he was 17 years old. There are different versions as to how he composed this song. Hilario Balilo, the former town mayor stated that the composer wrote the music and lyrics of the song one night after hearing a bird chirping and the leaves rustling.

{"id": "32694798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32694798", "title": "William Preston (Virginia)", "text": "William Preston (Virginia)\n\nCol. William Preston (December 25, 1729 – June 28, 1783) played a crucial role in surveying and developing the colonies going westward, exerted great influence in the colonial affairs of his time, ran a large plantation, and founded a dynasty whose progeny would supply leaders for the South for nearly a century. He served in the Virginia House of Burgesses, and was a Colonel in the militia during the American Revolutionary War. He was one of the thirteen signers of the Fincastle Resolutions, a predecessor to the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nHe was a founding trustee of Liberty Hall (later Washington and Lee University), when it was made into a college in 1776. \nWilliam Preston was born on Christmas Day, 1729, in Limavady, Ireland, to Col. John Preston and his wife Elizabeth. Elizabeth's father Henry Patton was a prominent shipwright and merchant, and her brother James Patton served with such distinction in the Royal Navy that the Crown granted him between 100,000 and 120,000 acres in America to permit British colonization beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains. The family immigrated to Augusta Co., Virginia, in 1738 on James's ship. Subsequent French and Indian resistance and reversal of British policy limited the impact of the family's grants, but Prestonsburg, Kentucky, was named in John's honor by its later founders. In 1755, he survived the Draper's Meadow massacre, an Indian attack against a settlement that was part of a property (later known as Smithfield Plantation) that he inherited from his uncle, Colonel James Patton, who died in the incident.\n\nRemaining in Virginia, William married Susanna Smith on January 17, 1761, and together they had 12 children. He and his family moved to Smithfield Plantation, in present-day Blacksburg, Virginia, in 1774 and it served as his final home. He previously resided at Greenfield Plantation at Fincastle, Botetourt County, Virginia.\n\nColonel Preston was elected to the Virginia colony's House of Burgesses in 1765 to represent Augusta County and served until the county was divided around 1770. In 1775, Preston was one of the thirteen signers of the Fincastle Resolutions.\n\nColonel Preston served in both the French and Indian War and American Revolutionary War. During the French and Indian War, William Preston saved George Washington's life from an impending Indian attack. During Lord Dunmore's War of 1773-1774 against the Shawnee Indians, he urged Virginians to join the militia to enact revenge on the Indians and plunder their stock of horses. As a Colonel in the militia, one of Colonel Preston's greatest contributions to the American Revolutionary War was his ability to suppress the Tories (British loyalists) from uprising in Southwest Virginia, thus helping prevent a civil war during the Revolution. He also helped aid in the fight against Lord Cornwallis and the British in the Carolinas.\n\nHe served as a founding trustee of Liberty Hall, formerly the Augusta Academy, when in 1776 it was renamed in a burst of revolutionary fervor and relocated to Lexington, Virginia. Other founding trustees along with Preston were prominent men including Andrew Lewis, Thomas Lewis, Samuel McDowell, Sampson Mathews, George Moffett, and James Waddel. Finally chartered in 1782, Liberty Hall was again renamed, to Washington College and finally Washington and Lee University. It is the ninth oldest institution of higher education in the country.\n\nColonel Preston died during a military muster near Price's Fork, Va., in 1783. The cause of death is unknown but it is believed to be either a heat stroke or a heart attack. He is buried in the family cemetery located on Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg, Virginia near Smithfield Plantation. His final home, Smithfield Plantation, has been restored and is listed on the U.S. Historical Registry, and is open for tours April through the first week in December.\n\nMany other prominent Americans descended from Colonel William Preston and his wife Susanna, for whom the plantation is named. They were parents or grandparents to governors, senators, presidential cabinet members, university founders and presidents, and military leaders. Most notably among them are the Prestons' son James Patton Preston, who was governor of Virginia from 1816–1819 and helped charter the University of Virginia, and their grandson William Ballard Preston, who was a Congressman, Secretary of the Navy under Zachary Taylor, and later a Senator from the Confederate States of America. William Ballard Preston also offered the Ordinance of Secession to the Virginia Legislature that resulted in Virginia joining the Confederacy, and he co-founded a small Methodist college, the Olin and Preston Institute, which was in financial difficulty by 1872. The trustees relinquished its charter and donated its property to the state, which reorganized the campus as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, the forerunner what is today Virginia Tech. \n\nColonel Preston was memorialized on July 27, 2011 with the Colonel William Preston highway in Blacksburg, Virginia.\n\nThe city of Prestonville, Kentucky, was erected on one of his land grants and named in his honor. It was (before 1800) the most important town in the county and larger than Port William. One of the first roads built in this section of the state was from the mouth of the Kentucky to New Castle in Henry County.\n\n\n"}
