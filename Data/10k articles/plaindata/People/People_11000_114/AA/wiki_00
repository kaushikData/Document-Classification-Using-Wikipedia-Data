O'Berry was a native to North Carolina, growing up in Edgecombe County on a farm with her family. She was involved in women's clubs and an open member of the Democratic party. More specifically, O’Berry's endeavors in the North Carolina Emergency Relief Association, North Carolina Democratic Party, League of Women Voters, and the Women's Missionary Society at her local Presbyterian Church demonstrated her dedication to serving her community. As an academic, O'Berry was named the first honor graduate from Peace University.\n\nAnnie Land O’Berry was born on May 28th 1885 in Edgecombe County, North Carolina to V.W. and Mary Dawson Mayo Land. O’Berry grew up on her family plantation and enjoyed playing outdoor sports until the age of 13, when her parents died and she moved to live with her her older sister in Littleton. From a young age, O’Berry was interested in and excelled at school. In grammar school O’Berry attained high marks and continued on to study at Littleton College. She then attended the William Peace University, graduating as the first honor graduate. \n\nAfter graduation, O’Berry moved in with her brother, Edward Land, in Kinston. There, O’Berry was an active member of the Presbyterian Church where she organized Sunday School and was chairman of the Women's Missionary Society. On December 14th, 1909 Annie Land married Thomas O’Berry and soon after they moved to Goldsboro, North Carolina. Throughout her career, O’Berry advocated for education and aspired to end adult illiteracy. In addition, as O’Berry focused on relief in her own community, she took a course on social work at Columbia University.\n\nWhile living with her brother in Kinston, Annie Land O’Berry was very active in the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs. She became the first chairman of the Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of Wayne County where she was the president for two years. O’Berry gave her time and effort to what was then called the Charity Organization of Goldsboro. She later went to Columbia University in order to learn more about this type of work. O’Berry also helped her father-in-law, Captain Nathan O’Berry of Goldsboro, raise over $5,000.00 to help white collar people during the depression. As a result, Governor Angus McLean appointed her to the Commission to Study County Government and the North Carolina Historical Commission. O’Berry also worked in the Goldsboro Club in Women's Club Work. She was elected vice-president of the State Federation in 1923 and, in 1927, was elected president. \n\nO’Berry's literacy committee sponsored an Educational Pilgrimage to Washington. It was recognized as one of the most outstanding projects of adult education in the United States. She was later named the vice-chair of the state executive committee of the Democratic Party in 1930. Three years later, in 1933, O’Berry became one of the few women to administer a state emergency relief agency as she became the administrator of the Civil Works Commission. The Civil Works Commission later became the North Carolina Emergency Relief Administration (NCERA). O’Berry continued to remain in-charge of an offshoot of NCERA, called the Rural Rehabilitation Corporation, until her death. This offshoot provided loans to farmers. Through her diplomacy, O’Berry provided both direct and indirect relief to many citizens.\n\nAnnie Land O’Berry worked to help clubwomen overcome indifference to civic responsibility. She inspired them to be civic-minded and to work for the advancement of adult education. She was viewed as ‘the little soldier,’ ‘relief lady,’ and a symbol of ‘food for the hungry, homes for the weary and a new chance for the discouraged.’ Although she had no children of her own, O’Berry raised her grand-nephew and grand-niece as her own. \n"}

He never went to school, but worked since he was about 13 years old as a fisherman. Later his family sent him on the cocoa plantations in the Ashante Region. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. From 1939 to 1970 he worked in numerous temporary employments. \n\nAccording to Regula Tschumi, Ataa Oko started to build figurative coffins around 1945. He had been inspired by the figurative palanquins he had seen in Accra. These palanquins were used by the Ga chiefs already at the beginning of the 20th century. The palanquins were built in the form of the respective family symbols which the Ga chiefs were using. Around 1960 Ataa Oko opened his own coffin and palanquin workshop in La. \n\nThe last years of his life, Ataa Oko was retired and hardly built coffins any more. Around 2005 the former carpenter started to draw. His graphic art practice was boorn as a result of his meeting with Regula Tschumi who was making a research about the figurative coffins of the Ga. Looking for information about this art form the ethnologist asked Ataa Oko to draw his former works he had made some 50 years ago. Ataa Oko's graphic work developed continuously. When he died in 2012, he left behind a comprehensive body of work that give a fascinating insight not only into the life of the artist, but also into the religious life and culture of the Ga people.\n\nAtaa Oko's coffins and drawings were first exhibited in the group show \"Six Feet Under\" at the Kunstmuseum Berne 2006 and 2010/11 he had first one-man show in the well known Collection de l'art brut in Lausanne. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14261749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14261749", "title": "Charles Derber", "text": "Charles Derber\n\nCharles Derber is an American Professor of Sociology at Boston College.\n\nDerber was born in Washington DC in January 1944, the son of New Deal economist Milton Derber. Routine evenings in the Derber household featured dinner discussions of politics and economics, imprinting a New Deal ideological framework upon young Derber. Reaching adulthood in the 1960s, Derber buried himself within the works of Karl Marx and Herbert Marcuse while in jail for protesting the Vietnam War. He attended Yale University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1965 and was a member of Manuscript Society. He attended the University of Chicago, and obtained his PhD in political science.\n\nDerber started at Brandeis University in 1979 and switched to Boston College in 1980. He became a professor in 1991 and has been teaching in the graduate program on social economy and social justice ever since.\n\nDerber's work falls into three major categories. One is a critique of individualism and American culture. His 1980 book \"The Pursuit of Attention\" focuses on ego-centeredness and \"conversational narcissism\" in everyday life as structured by class, gender and America’s individualistic culture. In 2000, Oxford University Press printed a 20th year commemorative edition of the book, making it a classic sociological work. \"The Wilding of America\", in its fifth edition, is a widely used text in American sociology. It offers a sharp critique of the American Dream and the crisis of hyper-individualism.\nDerber is best known to the general public for his analysis of corporate power and globalization. His book \"Corporation Nation\" is an study of how corporations penetrate and control every sector of American life. \"People Before Profit\", a treatment of corporate globalization and its alternatives, has been published in five languages.\n\nHis books, \"Regime Change Begins at Home\" and \"Hidden Power\", deal with the marriage of political and economic power in America. In 2006, the Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) nominated \"Hidden Power\" as one of the three best American books on current events.\nDerber's interests evolved to focus on ideology and political morality, as well as the new dynamics of global capitalism and of the movements, such as the Occupy Movement, that challenge it. His 2008 book, \"Morality Wars\" (co-authored with Yale Magrass), analyzes hegemonic discourses from the Roman Empire to the present. It also examines religious and \"born again\" ideologies, from German fascism to contemporary evangelical politics in the United States. Another 2008 book, with Katherine Adam, \"The New Feminized Majority\", examines the gendered character of values and politics in America. It shows that a new electoral majority has embraced progressive values historically associated with women; values now shared by millions of men.\n\nIn 2010, Derber published Greed to Green: Solving Climate Change and Remaking the Economy (Paradigm Publishers, 2010), that shows that climate change is a symptom of a dysfunctional lifestyle that can be solved only through a transformation of American capitalism and neo-liberal globalization. He argues that we are seeing a third wave environmentalism that is inseparable from the broader social and economic justice movements. In 2011, he published Marx's Ghost: Midnight Conversations on Changing the World, also translated also into Korean and Chinese. In an imaginative encounter, Derber engages Marx's ghost in a provocative conversation about today's crises, relying extensively on Marx's own quotations. Turning to a genre of literary social science, based on conversation, Derber lays out alternative visions and political strategies for movements such as the Occupy Movement.\n\nDerber's 2012 book \"The Surplus American: How the 1% Is Making Us Redundant\", co-authored with Yale Magrass, continues Derber's evolution into new genres of political writing. The Surplus American features not only a careful analysis of \"surplus people,\" those without jobs or any meaningful place in society, but a concluding play already performed at Boston College. The book describes a dystopia in 2020, where the majority of Americans have been rendered redundant through outsourcing, technological change and a corporate strategy to abandon the entire US economic infrastructure. While first drafted before the rise of the Occupy Movement the analysis is, prophetically, structured around a confrontation on Wall Street between financial elites and surplus people protesters.\n\nDerber’s 2017 book is \"Welcome to the Revolution: Universalizing Resistance for Social Justice\". It explores the anti-Trump resistance movement and the anti-systemic universalizing movement needed to transform contemporary militarized capitalism. In conjunction with that book, Derber has brought together leaders of unions and many social justice movement, to analyze where we go from here. With Routledge Publishers, Derber is editing a new Universalizing Resistance Book Series where leading critical public intellectuals and activists analyze and flesh out stories of mass anti-systemic resistance that moves beyond the siloes of our current Left and Progressive movements. Derber is also helping direct a series of films and books about and with Noam Chomsky, funded by the Wallace Action Fund.\nDerber is known as a public sociologist who writes for general audiences, offering not only sociological critiques but alternative visions. He appears frequently on talk shows, has written opinion pieces for media including the International Herald Tribune, the Boston Globe, the Christian Science Monitor, Newsday and Tikkun, and is a regular contributor to \"Cognoscenti\", the opinion page of WBUR, Boston's NPR station. He is one of the most prominent contemporaries of the sociological imagination as championed by C. Wright Mills, and, like Mills, he believes in the importance of melding critical scholarship with social justice activism.\n\nDerber has long been active in the peace, environmental and labor movements, from his 1960s work to register African-American voters in the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and his opposition to the Vietnam War to current movements such as Occupy and the struggle to prevent climate change and transform global corporate capitalism into a robust economic and political democracy.\n\nDerber’s work focuses on the crises of capitalism, globalization, corporate power, American militarism, the culture of hegemony, the climate crisis, and the new peace and global justice movements. Derber is persuaded that the overwhelming economic and cultural power of global corporations, increasingly melded with the political and military hegemonic power of the American government and the crises of global capitalism and global climate change, are together an integrated crisis that is now the pre-eminent social issue of the 21st century, and that a new vision and political movement is needed. Derber’s research is oriented toward 1) the systemic analysis of the intertwined crises we face and 2) analysis of the transformative potential of social movements arising to create a more democratic and egalitarian order. \nHis works include:\n\n"}

She was especially known for her rendition of Mexican rancheras, but she is also recognized for her contribution to other genres of popular Latin American music. She has been an influential interpreter in the Americas and Europe, muse to figures such as Pedro Almodóvar, hailed for her haunting performances, and called \"la voz áspera de la ternura\", the rough voice of tenderness. The Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, presented her with a Latin GRAMMY Statuette in 2007 after receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of that organization.\n\nShe was born in Costa Rica, in San Joaquín de Flores, as Isabel Vargas Lizano, daughter of Francisco Vargas and Herminia Lizano. She was baptized on 15 July 1919 with the forenames \"María Isabel Anita Carmen de Jesús.\" She had a difficult childhood: her parents divorced and left her under the care of an uncle, and she contracted poliomyelitis. She went by \"Chavela\", which is a pet name for Isabel. At age 17, she abandoned her native country due to lack of opportunities for a musical career, seeking refuge in Mexico, where an entertainment industry was burgeoning. There she resided for almost eight decades and obtained Mexican nationality. \n\nFor many years she sang on the streets, but in her thirties she became a professional singer. In her youth, she dressed as a man, smoked cigars, drank heavily, carried a gun, and was known for her characteristic red jorongo, which she donned in performances until old. Vargas sang the canción ranchera, which she performed in her own peculiar style. The typical ranchera, as represented by José Alfredo Jiménez, was a masculine but emotional song about love and its mishaps, usually mediated by alcohol, since in a macho culture, the display of feelings by men is allowed only to the drunk. The ranchera is sung from a man's perspective and with a mariachi accompaniment. Chavela sang this type of song as a solo, using only guitar and voice, evoking the singing style of a drunk man. She often slowed down the tempo of melodies to draw more dramatic tension out of songs, so they could be taken as naughtily humorous.\n\nTowards the end of the 1950s, she became known within artistic circles, due in part to her performances in Acapulco, center of international tourism, where she sang at the Champagne Room of the restaurant La Perla. Her first album, \"Noche de Bohemia\" (Bohemian Night), was released in 1961 with the professional support of José Alfredo Jiménez, one of the foremost singer/songwriters of Mexican ranchera music. She eventually recorded more than 80 albums. Vargas was hugely successful during the 1950s, the 1960s, and the first half of the 1970s, touring in Mexico, the United States, France, and Spain and was close to many prominent artists and intellectuals of the time, including Juan Rulfo, Agustín Lara, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Dolores Olmedo and José Alfredo Jiménez.\n\nIn the late 1970s Vargas partially retired from performing due to a 15-year battle with alcoholism, which she described in her autobiography (\"Y si quieres saber de mi pasado\" [And if you want to know about my past], published in 2002) as \"my 15 years in hell.\" Chavela couldn't keep on with her heavy drinking and intense lifestyle. In 1970, \"submerged in an alcoholic haze\" as she described it, she was taken in by an Indian family who nursed her back to health without knowing who she was. In 2003, she told \"The New York Times\" that she had not had a drink in 25 years.\n\nVargas returned to the stage in 1991, performing at a bohemian nightclub called \"El Hábito\" in Coyoacán, Mexico City. Her career started to recover international prominence, with performances in Latin America, Europe and the United States. Vargas debuted at Carnegie Hall in 2003 at age 83 at the behest and promotion of Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, an admirer and friend.\n\nAt age 81, she publicly came out as a lesbian in her autobiography titled \"And If You Want to Know about My Past\".\n\nBut it wasn't really a surprise to her fans. For years Vargas refused to change the genders in her songs. In \"Paloma Negra\" (\"Black Dove\"), Vargas accuses a woman of partying all night long and breaking her heart.\n\nVargas is featured in many of Almodóvar's films, including \"La flor de mi secreto\" in both song and video. She said, however, that acting was not her ambition, although she had previously participated in films such as the 1967 movie \"La Soldadera.\" Vargas also appeared in \"Frida\", singing \"La Llorona\" (The Weeping Woman). Her classic \"Paloma Negra\" (Black Dove) was also included in the soundtrack of the film. Vargas herself, as a young woman, was alleged to have had an affair with Frida Kahlo during Kahlo's marriage to muralist Diego Rivera. She appeared in Alejandro González Iñárritu's \"Babel\", singing \"Tú me acostumbraste\" (\"I got used to you\"), a bolero by Frank Domínguez.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, the biographical film \"Chavela\" debuted. Directed by Catherine Gund and Daresha Kyi, the film features Pedro Almodóvar, Elena Benarroch and Miguel Bosé among others.\n\nJoaquín Sabina's song \"Por el Boulevard de los Sueños Rotos\" (\"Down the Boulevard of Broken Dreams\") is dedicated to Vargas. Sergio Ramírez Mercado, a Nicaraguan writer, published in 2011 the novel \"La Fugitiva\", a fictionalized account of the life of Costa Rican writer Yolanda Oreamuno. In Ramírez' work, Oreamuno's life is told by three women who met her. According to many critics, one of the female characters telling Oreamuno's history is a singer who resembles Chavela Vargas. The character talks about her own life and her non-reciprocated lesbian love for Yolanda Oreamuno.\n\nChavela Vargas had been hospitalized for several weeks as a result of respiratory problems. She died in Cuernavaca, Mexico. According her official Facebook page, her last words were \"I leave with Mexico in my heart.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Informed that Ancient Pistol is at the door, Doll insists that he should not be allowed in because he's \"the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.\" After Pistol enters, Doll berates him with a string of insults: \"I scorn you, scurvy companion. What! you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen\nmate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away!\" She then threatens him with a knife, and Pistol pulls his sword. In the ensuing fight, Falstaff and Bardolph force him out. \n\nAfter his display of fighting prowess, Doll becomes very solicitous to Falstaff, calling him a \"whoreson little valiant villain\". She sits on his knee and kisses him. She asks him what Prince Hal is like; Falstaff gives a rather unflattering picture of him, unaware that Hal and Poins are nearby. When they reveal themselves, Falstaff claims he was intentionally \"dispraising\" the prince in the presence of \"the wicked\". Hal professes to be shocked, describing Doll as a \"virtuous gentlewoman\", to the enthusiastic agreement of Mistress Quickly. But Falstaff says Doll is \"in hell already, and burns poor souls\" (a reference to the burning sensation of venereal disease). When Falstaff is called away to the war, Doll becomes tearful. He leaves, but then calls on her to join him.\nShe next appears, apparently heavily pregnant, with Mistress Quickly. They are being arrested because Pistol has beaten up a man in a brawl in which they were involved. The man has since died. The officer says she will probably be whipped. Doll says that she should not be manhandled because she might have a miscarriage, but the arresting officer insists she has stuffed a cushion up her dress. Doll unleashes a stream of insults directed at the arresting officer's skinniness.\n\nAfter the death of King Henry IV, Falstaff learns about Doll's arrest and promises to have her released. But Hal, now king, refuses to listen to him.\n\nThough she does not appear in \"Henry V\", Doll is mentioned several times, though in contexts which appear to be inconsistent with one another. Pistol marries Mistress Quickly, whose first name is Nell. He gets into an argument with Corporal Nym, who himself wanted to marry her, and tells Nym to go to the hospital ('spital) and find Doll in the ward for sexually transmitted diseases (\"the powdering tub of infamy\") and marry her: \"Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,/ Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse\". After the Battle of Agincourt he receives a letter, from which he learns that \"my Doll is dead in the 'spital\" from \"malady of France\", i.e. syphilis. It is unclear whether this refers to Doll Tearsheet or Mistress Quickly, since the next line says he has lost his home, implying that the woman referred to is the person he lives with. It is often amended to \"Nell\" in modern editions. The Quarto version says \"Doll is sick\", not \"dead\", leaves out the \"my\", and makes no reference to losing a home.\n\nIt has been suggested that a version of \"Henry V\" existed in which Falstaff appeared, perhaps married to Quickly (which he said he would do in \"Henry IV, Part 2\"). At the epilogue to \"Henry IV, Part 2\" Shakespeare had promised another play to \"continue the story, with Sir John in it\", but Falstaff does not appear in existing versions of \"Henry V\". If such a version existed Pistol may have married Doll. If this highly speculative hypothesis is true, when Falstaff was cut out, much of his part was reassigned to Pistol, but the passage apparently referring to Doll as his wife was accidentally left unchanged.\n\nDoll's name is obviously emblematic of her trade. A contraction of Dorothy, the name \"Doll\", with its connotation of \"plaything\", was often given to prostitute characters, as with Doll Common in Jonson's play \"The Alchemist\". Her surname is suggestive of her activities, as is that of the other \"loose woman\" mentioned in the play, Jane Nightwork. Stanley Wells and Eric Partridge say she is \"so called, either because she tore the bed-sheets in her amorous tossings or because her partners did so while consorting with her\". According to René Weis, \n\nHarold Bloom says that Doll's eccentric compliments to Falstaff (\"thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig\") complement Hal's own apparently affectionate insults, with the difference that Doll's are sincere, since \"Falstaff the Bartholomew boar-pig has just proved himself to his doxy as being, in her words, a 'whoreson little valiant villain', and is fully to her taste. Falstaff the Manningtree ox, however, has just been unmercifully made game of by the Prince for running away at Gadshill in a fashion that could only, by everyone in the tavern company except Falstaff, be taken as showing downright cowardice.\"\n\nDoll appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play \"Falstaff's Wedding\" (1766), a comedy by William Kenrick, which is set in the period between the end of \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and the beginning of \"Henry V\". Doll and Mistress Quickly, having bribed their way out of prison, appear in the first act explaining to Falstaff how they were arrested. They later plot to disguise themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting Robert Shallow and Abraham Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so Doll ends up married to Nym.\n\nJames White's book \"Falstaff's Letters\" (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his cronies, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. Several letters from Quickly to Falstaff complain about his treatment of Doll.\n\nIn Oliver St. John Gogarty's poem \"Applied Poetry\" Doll is invoked. The poet tells his beloved that she is filled with the beauties of springtime, and like the breeze that sways a field of buttercups, \"As if Doll Tearsheet lay / And leapt again\". When she expresses outrage at being compared to a whore, he explains, \n<poem>\nBut she was meant to show,\nThat only women know\nThe human essence,\nAnd see beneath a part,\nThough clothed upon\nBy Evil, the rich heart\nOf gross Sir John;\nWhich no one else perceived.\n</poem>\n\nDoll also appears as a character in Gustav Holst's 1925 opera \"At the Boar's Head\". A soprano role, it was first performed by Constance Willis, conducted by Malcolm Sargent.\n"}

{"id": "455908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=455908", "title": "Harmodius and Aristogeiton", "text": "Harmodius and Aristogeiton\n\nHarmodius (Greek: Ἁρμόδιος, \"Harmódios\") and Aristogeiton (Ἀριστογείτων, \"Aristogeíton\"; both died 514 BC) were two lovers from ancient Athens. They became known as the Tyrannicides (τυραννοκτόνοι, \"tyrannoktonoi\") after they killed the Peisistratid tyrant Hipparchus, and were the preeminent symbol of democracy to ancient Athenians.\n\nThe two principal historical sources covering Harmodius and Aristogeiton are the \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" (VI, 56–59) by Thucydides, and \"The Constitution of the Athenians\" (XVIII) attributed to Aristotle or his school. However, their story is documented by a great many other ancient writers, including important sources such as Herodotus and Plutarch. Herodotus claimed that Harmodius and Aristogeiton presumably were \"Gephyraeans\" () i.e. Boeotians of Syrian or Phoenician origin. Plutarch, in his book \"On the malice of Herodotus\" criticized Herodotus for prejudice and misrepresentation and he argued that Harmodius and Aristogeiton were Euboeans or Eretrians.\n\nPeisistratus had become tyrant of Athens after his third attempt in 546/7 BCE. In Archaic Greece, the term tyrant did not connote malevolence. A tyrant was simply one who had seized power and ruled outside of a state's constitutional law. When Peisistratus died in 528/7 BC, his son Hippias took the position of Archon and became the new tyrant of Athens, with the help of his brother, Hipparchus, who acted as the minister of culture. The two continued their father's policies, but their popularity declined after Hipparchus began to abuse the power of his position.\n\nFollowing Hipparchus' rejection by Harmodius, for whom he had unrequited feelings, Hipparchus invited Harmodius' young sister to be the kanephoros (to carry the ceremonial offering basket) at the Panathenaea festival, and then publicly chased her away on the pretext she was not a virgin, as required. This publicly shamed Harmodius' family; then he, with his lover Aristogeiton, resolved to assassinate both Hippias and Hipparchus and thus to overthrow the tyranny. The assassination attempt succeeded and Hipparchus was killed in 514/3, but Hippias remained in power. The truly tyrannical (by today's standards) actions in the remaining years of his reign are typically attributed by contemporary scholars as paranoia and anger over the assassination.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, however, it was Thessalos, the hot-headed son of Peisistratus' Argive concubine, and thus half-brother to Hipparchus, who was the one to court Harmodius and drive off his sister.\n\nThe plot – to be carried out by means of daggers hidden in the ceremonial myrtle wreaths on the occasion of the Panathenaic Games – involved a number of other co-conspirators. Thucydides claims that \"this was the only day on which it was possible for the citizens who formed the parade to assemble armed without arousing suspicion\". Aristotle disagrees, asserting that the custom of bearing weapons was introduced later, by the democracy.\n\nSeeing one of the co-conspirators greet Hippias in a friendly manner on the assigned day, the two thought themselves betrayed and rushed into action, ruining the carefully laid plans. They managed to kill Hipparchus, stabbing him to death as he was organizing the Panathenaean processions at the foot of the Acropolis. Herodotus expresses surprise at this event, asserting that Hipparchus had received a clear warning concerning his fate in a dream. Harmodius was killed on the spot by spearmen of Hipparchus' guards, while Aristogeiton was arrested shortly thereafter. Upon being told of the event, Hippias, feigning calm, ordered the marching Greeks to lay down their ceremonial weapons and to gather at an indicated spot. All those with concealed weapons or under suspicion were arrested, gaining Hippias a respite from the uprising.\n\nThucydides' identification of Hippias as the two's purported main target, rather than Hipparchus who was Aristogeiton's rival erastes, has been suggested as a possible indication of bias on his part.\n\nAristotle in the \"Constitution of Athens\" preserves a tradition that Aristogeiton died only after being tortured in the hope that he would reveal the names of the other conspirators. During his ordeal, personally overseen by Hippias, he feigned willingness to betray his co-conspirators, claiming only Hippias' handshake as guarantee of safety. Upon receiving the tyrant's hand he is reputed to have berated him for shaking the hand of his own brother's murderer, upon which the tyrant wheeled and struck him down on the spot.\n\nLikewise, there is a tradition that Aristogeiton (or Harmodius)\nwas in love with a courtesan (see hetaera) by the name of Leæna (Λέαινα – meaning lioness) who also was kept by Hippias under torture – in a vain attempt to force her to divulge the names of the other conspirators – until she died. One version holds that previous to being tortured she had bitten off her tongue, afraid that her resolve would break from the pain of the torture. Another is that the Athenians, unwilling to honour a courtesan, placed a statue of a lioness without a tongue in the vestibule of the Acropolis simply to honor her fortitude in maintaining silence. The statue was made by the sculptor Amphicrates. It was also in her honor that Athenian statues of Aphrodite were from then on accompanied by stone lionesses [after Pausanias].\n\nHis brother's murder led Hippias to establish an even stricter dictatorship, which proved very unpopular and was overthrown, with the help of an army from Sparta, in 508. This was followed by the reforms of Cleisthenes, who established a democracy in Athens.\n\nSubsequent history came to identify the figures of Harmodius and Aristogeiton as martyrs to the cause of Athenian freedom, possibly for political and class reasons, and they became known as \"the Liberators\" (\"eleutherioi\") and \"the Tyrannicides\" (\"tyrannophonoi\"). According to later writers, descendants of Harmodius and Aristogeiton's families were given hereditary privileges, such as \"sitesis\" (the right to take meals at public expense in the town hall), \"ateleia\" (exemption from certain religious duties), and \"proedria\" (front-row seats in the theater).\n\nA number of years after the event, it had become a received tradition among the Athenians to believe that Hipparchus was the elder of the brothers, and to fashion him as the tyrant.\n\nAfter the establishment of democracy, Cleisthenes commissioned the sculptor Antenor to produce a bronze statue group of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. It was the first commission of its kind, and the very first statue to be paid for out of public funds, as the two were the first Greeks considered by their countrymen worthy of having statues raised to them.\nAccording to Pliny the Elder, it was erected in the Kerameikos in 509, as part of a cenotaph of the heroes. However, a far more probable location is in the Agora at Athens, and many later authors such as Pausanius and Timaeus attest to this. Annual offerings \"(enagismata)\" were presented there by the polemarch, the Athenian minister of war. There it stood alone as special laws prohibited the erection of any other statues in their vicinity. Upon its base was inscribed a verse by the poet Simonides:\n\nThe statue was taken as war booty in 480 BC by Xerxes I during the early Greco-Persian Wars and installed by him at Susa. As soon as the Greeks vanquished the Persians at Salamis, a new statue was commissioned. It was sculpted this time by Kritios and Nesiotes, and set up in 477/476 BC. It is the one which served as template for the group we possess today, which was found in the ruins of Hadrian's villa and is now in Naples. According to Arrian, when Alexander the Great conquered the Persian empire, in 330, he discovered the statue at Susa and had it shipped back to Athens. When the statue, on its journey back, arrived at Rhodes it was given divine honors.\n\nSeveral comments of the ancients regarding the statue have come down to us. When asked, in the presence of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, which type of bronze was the best, Antiphon the Sophist replied, \nLycurgus, in his oration against Leocrates, asserts that, \nOther sculptors made statues of the heroes, such as Praxiteles, who made two, also of bronze.\n\nThe statue group has been seen, in modern times, as an invitation to identify erotically and politically with the figures, and to become oneself a tyrannicide. According to Andrew Stewart, the statue \nThe configuration of the group is duplicated on a painted vase, a Panathenaic amphora from 400, and on a bas-relief on the Elgin throne, dated to ca. 300.\n\nAnother tribute to the two heroes was a hymn (skolion) praising them for restoring isonomia (equal distribution of justice) to the Athenians. The skolion may be referred to 500 BC or thereabouts, \nand is ascribed to Callistratus, an Athenian poet known only for this work. It is preserved by Athenaeus. Its popularity was such that \nWhen sung, the singer would hold a branch of myrtle in his hand. This ode has been translated by many modern poets such as Edgar Allan Poe, who composed his \"\" in 1827. The following translation was judged to be the best and most faithful of a number of versions attempted in Victorian England.\n<poem>\nIn myrtles veil'd will I the falchion wear,\nFor thus the patriot sword\nHarmodius and Aristogiton bare,\nWhen they the tyrant's bosom gored, \nAnd bade the men of Athens be \nRegenerate in equality.\n\nOh! beloved Harmodius! never \nShall death be thine, who liv'st for ever. \nThy shade, as men have told, inherits \nThe islands of the blessed spirits,\nWhere deathless live the glorious dead,\nAchilles fleet of foot, and Diomed.\n\nIn myrtles veil'd will I the falchion wear, \nFor thus the patriot sword\nHarmodius and Aristogiton bare,\nWhen they the tyrant's bosom gored; \nWhen in Minerva's festal rite \nThey closed Hipparchus' eyes in night.\n\nHarmodius' praise, Aristogiton's name, \nShall bloom on earth with undecaying fame; \nWho with the myrtle-wreathed sword \nThe tyrant's bosom gored, \nAnd bade the men of Athens be \nRegenerate in equality.\n</poem>\n\nThe story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and its treatment by later Greek writers, is illustrative of attitudes to pederasty in ancient Greece. Both Thucydides and Herodotus describe the two as lovers, their love affair was styled as moderate \"(sophron)\" and legitimate \"(dikaios)\". Further confirming the status of the two as paragons of pederastic ethics, a domain forbidden to slaves, a law was passed prohibiting slaves from being named after the two heroes.\n\nThe story continued to be cited as an admirable example of heroism and devotion for many years. In 346 BC, for example, the politician Timarchus was prosecuted (for political reasons) on the grounds that he had prostituted himself as a youth. The orator who defended him, Demosthenes, cited Harmodius and Aristogeiton, as well as Achilles and Patroclus, as examples of the beneficial effects of same-sex relationships. Aeschines offers them as an example of \"dikaios erōs,\" \"just love\", and as proof of the boons such love brings the lovers – who were both improved by love beyond all praise – as well as to the city.\n\n\n\n\n"}

With John Heminges, he was instrumental in preparing and editing the First Folio, the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623.\n\nCondell's early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from East Anglia, as his will mentions 'my Cosen Gilder late of newe Buckenham’. According to Edmond:\n\nThe only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, née Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at St Peter on 5 September 1576.\n\nTraditionally, he is associated with the \"Harry\" who appears in the cast list for Richard Tarlton's \"The Seven Deadly Sins\", but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in Lord Strange's Men alongside John Heminges and Augustine Phillips. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at St Laurence Pountney, Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the Strand, gentleman. They settled in St Mary Aldermanbury, the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as churchwarden in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611).\n\nDetails of Condell's mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the Lord Chamberlain's and King's companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after Burbage and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; Nicholas Tooley and Alexander Cooke named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at Fulham in Middlesex and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in Snowshill, Gloucestershire. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will.\n\nIn addition to \"Every Man in His Humour\" (1598) and \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of Jonson's plays: \"Sejanus\" (1603), \"Volpone\" (1605), \"The Alchemist\" (1610), and \"\" (1611). He was the original Cardinal in John Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\" (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679:\n\n\n\nCondell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627. He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627. His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635.\n\nCondell left an extensive estate, including shares in the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres.\n\nIn the 2016 sitcom \"Upstart Crow\", Henry Condell is played by Dominic Coleman.\n\n\n"}

When included in the name of continental European properties or churches, any meaning is often imprecise, and may refer to some distant period of the history of what is today a property that is either a normal parish church, or ceased to have any religious function some time ago. Secondary churches or establishments run from a monastery were often called \"hermitages\". \n\nIn the 18th century, some owners of English country houses equipped their gardens with a \"hermitage\", sometimes a Gothic ruin, but sometimes, as at Painshill Park, a romantic hut which a \"hermit\" was recruited to occupy. The so-called Ermita de San Pelayo y San Isidoro is the ruins of a Romanesque church from Ávila, Spain, that eventually ended several hundred miles away, as a garden feature in the Buen Retiro Park in Madrid.\n\nA hermitage is any type of domestic dwelling in which a hermit lives. While the level of isolation can vary widely, more often than not it is associated with a nearby monastery. Typically, hermitages consist of at least one detached room, or sometimes a dedicated space within an open floor plan building, for religious devotion, basic sleeping accommodations, and a domestic cooking range, suitable for the ascetic lifestyle of the inhabitant. Depending on the work of the hermit, premises such as a studio, workshop or chapel may be attached or sited in proximity.\n\nOriginally, the first hermitages were located in natural caves, temple ruins, and even simple huts in forests and deserts. Around the time of early fourth century (around 300 AD), the spiritual retreats of the Desert Fathers, who had chosen to live apart from society in the relative isolation of the Nitrian Desert of Egypt, began to attract the attention of the wider Christian community. The piety of such hermits often attracted both laity and other would-be ascetics, forming the first cenobitic communities called \"sketes\", such as Nitria and Kellia. Within a short time, more and more people arrived to adopt the teachings and lifestyle of these hermits, and there began by necessity a mutual exchange of labour and shared goods between them, forming the first monastic communities.\n\nIn the later feudal period of the Middle Ages, both monasteries and hermitages alike were endowed by royalty and nobility in return for prayers being said for their family, believing it to beneficial to the state of their soul.\n\nCarthusian monks typically live in a one-room cell or building, with areas for study, sleep, prayer, and preparation of meals. Most Carthusians live a mostly solitary life, meeting with their brethren for communion, for shared meals on holy days, and again irregularly for nature walks, where they are encouraged to have simple discussions about their spiritual life.\n\nIn the modern era, hermitages are often abutted to monasteries, or located on their grounds, being occupied by monks who receive dispensation from their abbot or prior to live a semi-solitary life. However, hermitages can be found in a variety of settings, from isolated rural locations, houses in large cities, and even high-rise blocks of flats, depending on the hermit's means.\n\nExamples of hermitages in Western Christian tradition:\n\nA poustinia is a small, sparsely furnished cabin or room where one goes to pray and fast alone \"in the presence of God\". The word \"poustinia\" has its origin in the Russian word for desert.\n\nIn Hinduism, a hermitage is called an ashram. Traditionally, an ashram in ancient India was a place where sages lived in peace and tranquility amidst nature.\n\n\n"}

He was appointed in 1785, at the age of 35, mayor and first consul of Draguignan, and in 1785 and in 1786, he was designated a representative to provincial states of the pays d'etat of Provence.\n\nWhen the social and political movements of the French Revolution started in 1789, Honoré Muraire was charged by the municipality of Draguignan to participate in the preparation of the cahiers de doléances, and assisted in writing up a plan for the reform of the courts and a draft regulation concerning the bourgeois militia.\n\nIn 1790, he went on a mission to the National Assembly to promote his hometown for the coveted designation as chef-lieu for the new department of Var instead of Toulon, as Draguignan was more centrally located. He would return from his mission to take the position of president of the district. It was during this period that he became involved in freemasonry.\n\nThe voters of the district of Draguignan elected him to the Legislative Assembly on 8 September 1791 (elected second out of eight, by 250 votes on 489 voting). He sat on the Legislative Committee, and reported to the assembly on 15 February 1792, in his capacity as rapporteur, a series of recommendations for marriage reform. He was appointed president of the Assembly (13–27 May 1792).\n\nAs the fall of the French monarchy unfolded in the summer of 1792, Muraire took the side of the doomed Louis XVI. On 13 July 1792, Muraire requested action be taken against Pétion and Manuel, respectively mayor and attorney of the Paris Commune, as conspirators and accomplices of the protests of 20 June 1792, and later defended the actions of the monarchist general La Fayette.\n\nFor adopting these unpopular positions, he is not returned to the Convention in the elections of September 1792. This setback turned to his advantage as he avoided the excesses and purges of the French Terror, although he did spend some time imprisoned in Sainte-Pelagie. He was released during the Thermidorian Reaction\n\nUnder the French Directory, he was elected in September 1795 (23 Vendémiaire IV) as a member of the Council of Ancients by the department of the Seine by 364 votes out of 876 voters. Following the 18 Fructidor V coup (4 September 1797), several deputies came under the threat of arrest and deportation. Muraire, who had spoken in favor of émigré and deported priests, appeared along with such conservatives as de Pastoret, Camille Jordan, and Boissy d'Anglas, on the list of suspects. Sentenced to be deported to Cayenne, French Guiana, he instead found a way to hide, and ended up sentenced to detention at the island of Oléron, where he remained more than two years.\n\nBy a decree dated 5 Nivose year VIII (25 December 1799), he is pardoned, along with his companions in exile, by the newly appointed first consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, and permitted to come to Paris and to remain there under the supervision of the department of the police.\n\nHighly recommended by Joseph Bonaparte, a fellow freemason, Muraire was appointed as the first commissioner to the Paris Prosecutor by the first consul, before being appointed to the tribunal of cassation as a counselor 11 Germinal VIII (1 April 1800). When the original president of this institution (created in 1790), François Denis Tronchet, was appointed senator in 1801, Muraire succeeded him. Muraire received further promotions, appointed adviser to state the 14 Floreal X (4 May 1802), then the first First President of the Court of Cassation on 29 Floreal XII (19 April 1804). He requested of the Emperor, who agreed, that the court of cassation, just as the Parlements before 1789, would inaugurate its work by a religious ceremony.\n\nHis daughter Elisabeth married Élie, duc Decazes (future Prime Minister of France 1819-1820), 1 August 1805, but she died shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1809, Napoleon I appointed him to the comte de l'Empire. He named a senator in 1811, and became a Chevalier de l'ordre de la Reunion 3 April 1812, an honour just below the Legion of Honour. In recognition of such honors, Muraire served Bonaparte with much zeal.\n\nAlas, when the Emperor first fell from power, Muraire and his Court of Cassation declared that they would abide by the proclamation of Talleyrand's Provisional Government and support \"the stronger side.\" Muraire personally complimented Comte d'Artois soon after. It is not enough to preserve him in his lofty position, and he is replaced as President of the Court by de Sèze 16 February 1815.\n\nThe Hundred Days (beginning in March 1815) briefly resurrected his fortunes, and Muraire, retaking his position at the head of the Court of Cassation, personally proclaimed the restoration of Napoleon as Emperor at the Tuileries. Of course, with the Battle of Waterloo, his political career is ruined.\n\nMuraire spent the rest of his days in social life, literary pursuits and Masonic activities. He died 20 November 1837, at the age of 87 years, in Paris. A posthumous portrait, painted by Georges Cain, has sat since 1892 in a place of honour in the gallery of the first Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation.\n"}

{"id": "43790219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43790219", "title": "Ji Dengkui", "text": "Ji Dengkui\n\nJi Dengkui (; 17 March 1923 – 13 July 1988) was a prominent Chinese political figure during the Cultural Revolution. He was a member of the 10th and 11th Politburos of the Communist Party and was a protégé of Mao Zedong in Mao's later years. He served in a number of important government and military posts, including member of the Central Military Commission, Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region, and Vice Premier of the State Council. After Mao's death in 1976, he supported Mao's designated successor, Hua Guofeng, in purging the Gang of Four. Two years later, Deng Xiaoping ousted Hua from his leadership position, and Ji, labelled the \"Little Gang of Four\" together with other prominent Hua supporters, was forced out of politics.\n\nJi Dengkui was born in Wuxiang County, Shanxi province on 17 March 1923. After the eruption of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, he joined the anti-Japanese resistance before turning 15, and the Communist Party of China the following year. During the Anti-Japanese War and the subsequent Chinese Civil War, he served in various party positions including Party Secretary of Lushan County in Henan province. Although he participated in some battles during the wars, he frankly admitted that he had little military experience, even after Mao Zedong appointed him to top military posts of China in the 1970s.\n\nAfter Mao's Communist Party won the Civil War and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, Ji continued to serve as a local party official in Henan. In 1951, Ji met Mao for the first time during Mao's tour of Henan. Ji, then Deputy Party Secretary of Xuchang prefecture, reportedly gained the favour of Mao by giving straightforward answers to Mao's questions, and frankly admitted that he had killed innocent people by mistake during the Communist Revolution. Mao praised his work and Ji was soon promoted to Party Secretary of Xuchang, at the age of only 28. He served as the Party Secretary of Luoyang prefecture during the Great Leap Forward (1958 to 1961), and avoided implementing the catastrophic policies of other local leaders which caused extensive famine in Henan, especially in Xinyang prefecture. Few people died of hunger in Luoyang, while more than a million people starved to death in the infamous \"Xinyang Incident\".\n\nMao Zedong visited Henan more than ten times before the start of the Cultural Revolution, and summoned Ji Dengkui for reporting whenever he was in the province. Although Mao was 30 years older than Ji, he publicly referred to Ji as his \"old friend\". Ji rose quickly within the party ranks, first to the provincial party committee as an alternate party secretary, and later to the national government.\n\nWhen the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, Ji was a deputy director of the Henan Cultural Revolution Committee, effectively the deputy head of the provincial government. When the so-called January Storm swept through China in January 1967, China fell into anarchy and the radical Rebel Faction (\"Zaofanpai\" 造反派) of the Red Guards took over many local governments, including that of Henan. Ji was persecuted and imprisoned by the Rebels for six months, and endured numerous struggle sessions. In July 1967, however, Ji was released and restored as the deputy director of the Henan Revolutionary Committee, and the \"de facto\" top leader in Henan. His release was announced after a visit to Henan from representatives of the central government, and was believed to be partly due to his relationship with Mao.\n\nIn 1969, Ji was designated by Mao to speak as a representative of the \"revolutionary cadres\" at the 9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at which he was elected a member of the Central Committee. Soon afterward he was elected an alternate member of the Politburo, catapulting him into the ranks of national leaders.\n\nAs one of Mao's loyal supporters, Ji became a member of the Central Military Commission in September 1970 as part of Mao's strategy to \"mix the sand\" by inserting officials loyal to him into the ranks of Lin Biao's military staff to keep a check on Lin. He was also appointed Political Commissar of the crucial Beijing Military Region.\n\nAfter Lin Biao's death in a 1971 plane crash, Ji was elected a full member of the 10th Politburo in 1973, and became Vice-Premier in January 1975.\n\nAfter Mao died in 1976, Ji supported Mao's designated successor Hua Guofeng, and helped Hua purge the Gang of Four, including Mao's widow Jiang Qing, from the CPC leadership. He was instrumental in taking over the influential newspaper \"Guangming Daily\", which had been controlled by the Gang of Four. In 1977, he was re-elected a full member of the 11th Politburo.\n\nJi was a member of the \"Whatever Faction\" that allied with Hua Guofeng, who was eventually to be outmaneuvered by Deng Xiaoping to resign from the highest command of party leadership. Leading up to the watershed events in 1978, Ji had served as the Executive Vice Premier of the Council in charge of agriculture. Although initially playing a key role in setting the agenda and drafting documents on agricultural development, Ji quickly found himself subject to criticisms from all sides for \"mistakes\" he made during the Cultural Revolution at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Party Congress in 1978. Taken over from Hua Guofeng by Chen Yun and Hu Yaobang, the subsequent discussion sessions turned to the historical cases of Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai, Tao Zhu, and Bo Yibo. According to Yu Guangyuan, who was in the same Northwest Group at the Conference, Ji remained noticeably passive throughout these sessions. “Among the 35 members in northwest group,\" recounts Yu, \"34 of them spoke actively.\" Ji was also named, after his fellow Vice Premier Wang Dongxing was criticized by Hu Yaobang and Yu Guangyuan's reformist camp. Eventually, Ji Dengkui, Wang Dongxing, Wu De, and Chen Xilian, the four high-ranking allies of Hua, were labelled the \"Little Gang of Four\" and dismissed from the most important of their political posts. Although the decision was made in 1978, it was not made public until February 1980, at the Fifth Plenum of the Party Congress.\n\nJi was reassigned a researcher at the Research Center of Rural Development in China in 1982. He died of an illness on 13 July 1988, at the age of 65.\n"}

Amash (; born April 18, 1980) is an American attorney and Republican member of Congress. In January 2011, he began serving as the U.S. Representative for . The district is based in Grand Rapids and was once represented by President Gerald Ford.\n\nAmash was first elected to the House in the 2010 Congressional election. Previously he was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives representing the 72nd District, which is centered on the city of Kentwood and includes his home in Cascade Township as well as the townships of Caledonia and Gaines. At the age of 30, Amash assumed office as the second youngest sitting U.S. Representative (behind 29-year-old Aaron Schock of Illinois). As of January 2016, Amash is the seventh youngest U.S. Representative. He is Chairman of the House Liberty Caucus and associated with the Tea Party movement. Amash has been described and self-identifies as a libertarian Republican. He was described as a diligent member of Congress and a \"stickler for rules\" who has \"never missed a vote\" in Congress. Amash missed his first vote in March 2017, after six years as a U.S. Representative.\n\nBorn in Grand Rapids, and raised in Kentwood, Michigan, Amash is a first US born generation Arab-American son of a Palestinian Christian father and a Syrian Christian mother.\n\nHis father, Attallah, is a business owner, whose family immigrated to the United States in 1956 through the sponsorship of a Christian pastor and his family. His mother, Mimi, is a Syrian immigrant to the United States.\n\nAmash attended Kelloggsville Christian School in Kelloggsville and graduated as class valedictorian from Grand Rapids Christian High School. He graduated from the University of Michigan \"magna cum laude\" with a B.A. in economics and earned his J.D. at the University of Michigan Law School in 2005. Amash admires economists F. A. Hayek and Frédéric Bastiat.\n\nAmash is married and the father of three children. He is an Orthodox Christian in the Antiochian Archdiocese of North America.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Michigan, he became a consultant to his family's tool business. He worked as a corporate attorney for his family's business for a year, before being elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2008.\n\nAmash ran for the Michigan House of Representatives in 2008 in Michigan's 72nd House District. During this time, he donated to the campaigns of Congressman Ron Paul and John McCain. In the Republican primary, he won a five candidate election with 41% of the vote, defeating opponent Ken Yonker by 723 votes, a 6.3% margin. The incumbent, Glenn D. Steil, Jr., was barred from running by term limits. In the general election, Amash defeated Democrat Albert Abbasse 61%–36%.\n\nDuring his initial tenure in the State House, Amash sponsored five resolutions and twelve bills, but none of them passed. While in the State House, Amash began using his Twitter and Facebook pages to report his floor votes and explain his reasoning. Amash was noted for his perfect attendance record, until he missed a vote on March 10, 2017.\n\nIn its October 25, 2010, issue, Amash was named one of \"Time\" magazine's \"40 under 40 – Rising Stars of U.S. Politics\". At the age of 30, Amash was the youngest federal officeholder in the United States on \"Time\"'s list.\n\nOn August 3, 2010, Amash won the five-way Republican primary for the seat vacated by retiring Republican Vern Ehlers with over 40% of the vote. He was endorsed by the Club for Growth, Ron Paul, and FreedomWorks PAC during his primary campaign.\n\nDuring the general election, Amash campaigned on a conservative platform. Amash defeated Democrat Patrick Miles, Jr. 60%–37% in 2010.\n\nAmash won re-election to the U.S. House in 2012 for his second term, defeating Steve Pestka 53%–44%.\n\nAfter initial speculation that he might run for the U.S. Senate, Amash confirmed that he would run for re-election to the House of Representatives in 2014.\n\nAmash was endorsed by the fiscally conservative Club for Growth PAC, which spent over $500,000 supporting Amash in his Republican primary against former East Grand Rapids School Trustee Brian Ellis, who was endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and spent more than $1 million of his own money on the race.\n\nAfter Amash defeated Ellis in the August primary, with 57.4% of the vote to Ellis' 42.6%, Amash was highly critical of Ellis and former Congressman Pete Hoekstra, who had backed Ellis. Of Hoekstra, Amash said, \"You are a disgrace. And I'm glad we could hand you one more loss before you fade into total obscurity and irrelevance.\" Amash took exception to one of Ellis' television ads that quoted California Republican Congressman Devin Nunes calling Amash \"Al Qaeda's best friend in Congress\"; he demanded an apology from Ellis for running what he called a \"disgusting, despicable smear campaign.\" As Friedersdorf of \"The Atlantic\" notes, \"Amash voted against the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, favored a measure to repeal indefinite detention, and opposed reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act.\"\n\nIn the general election, Amash defeated Democrat Bob Goodrich and Green Party candidate Tonya Duncan with 58% of the vote.\n\nAmash won re-election to the U.S. House in 2016 for his fourth term, defeating Douglas Smith 59%–38%.\n\nAmash has been noted for his attendance. From January 2011 to February 2017, Amash missed none of the 4,243 roll call votes.\n\nAmash supports free markets with limited government regulation. He advocates for economic freedom and believes that stimulus programs and government bailouts are ineffective ways to energize the economy. He supports adopting a flat tax in lieu of targeted tax breaks and subsidies. Amash opposes central economic planning, which he believes contributes to unemployment, inflation, and unstable business cycles.\n\nHe was one of four Republicans who joined 161 Democrats to oppose a Constitutional amendment that would require a yearly balanced budget, due to serious concerns with that specific proposal. Earlier that year, Amash had introduced H.J.Res. 81, an alternative balanced budget amendment that addressed those concerns.\n\nAmash supports decreased federal intervention in energy-related issues. He wants to eliminate government-sponsored subsidies for energy production and decrease overall regulation. He believes that no form of energy production should be specially favored or restricted. In addition, Amash supports minimizing federal environmental regulations. He voted in favor of the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, which would have amended the Clean Air Act of 1963 to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating specified greenhouse gasses as air pollutants.\n\nAmash was the only representative from Michigan to oppose federal aid in response to the Flint water crisis, arguing that \"the U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one.\" Instead Amash contended that \"the State of Michigan should provide comprehensive assistance to the people of Flint.\"\n\nAmash has expressed opposition to political gerrymandering. He said in 2018, \"I firmly believe there should be an independent process for drawing districts. They should be based on geographic considerations, and they should be as compact and contiguous as possible...I always felt the maps should be drawn in a way that is less political and more based on geographic considerations.\"\n\nOn May 4, 2017, Amash voted in favor of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and to pass a revised version of the American Health Care Act. Amash initially opposed the American Health Care Act, describing it as \"Swampcare\", tweeting that \"It didn't take long for the swamp to drain @realDonaldTrump\" and criticizing House leadership for attempting to \"ram it through.\" Nevertheless, Amash voted for the updated AHCA plan before the Congressional Budget Office could determine its impact or cost.\n\nIn July 2018 House Republicans introduced a resolution “supporting the officers and personnel” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Amash was the only Republican in the chamber to vote against the resolution. He tweeted, “The House voted today on an inane resolution regarding ICE. The resolution makes several dubious claims and denounces calls to abolish ICE. I wouldn’t abolish ICE without an alternative, but there’s no reason to treat a federal agency as though it’s beyond reproach and reform.”\n\nAmash has been a frequent critic of the National Security Agency's anti-terrorism surveillance programs.\n\nHe voted against the 2011 reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act, the 2012 reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act, and the USA Freedom Act.\n\nAmash opposed President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. He stated: \"Like Pres. Obama's executive actions on immigration, Pres. Trump's executive order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system.\"\n\nAmash proposed an amendment to the reauthorization bill of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Amash amendment would have required the government in criminal cases to seek a warrant based on probable cause before searching surveillance data for information about Americans. While the Amash amendment received bipartisan support as well as support from civil liberties groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, the amendment ultimately failed by a vote of 183 to 233.\n\nAmash is pro-life. He opposes abortion and the use of federal funding for abortion.\n\nWhile Amash opposes government funding for abortion, he voted \"present\", rather than \"yes\" or \"no\" on the 2011 Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act, which provided for the cessation of federal funding to Planned Parenthood. He explained, \"Legislation that names a specific private organization to defund (rather than all organizations that engage in a particular activity) is improper and arguably unconstitutional\". When the \"New York Times\" asked him to explain his approach to voting on legislation, he replied, \"I follow a set of principles, I follow the Constitution. And that's what I base my votes on. Limited government, economic freedom, and individual liberty.\"\n\nHe supported a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act as per his Twitter account, stating that the \"real threat\" to traditional marriage and religious liberty is government, and not gay couples.\n\nIn July 2018 Amash was the only member of the U.S. House to vote against creating a three-digit suicide prevention hotline. He wrote on Twitter, “It’s another good idea without a constitutional basis. I swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I take that oath seriously. Constitutional limits are meaningless if we ignore them whenever we like the policy outcome.”\n\nAmash endorsed Ron Paul for president in 2012. Paul's brother, David, was an assistant pastor in Amash's district and endorsed Amash, saying the Michigan congressman shares common ground with Paul. He has also endorsed Senator Rand Paul for president in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. After Paul dropped out of the Republican primary race, Amash endorsed Senator Ted Cruz in his bid for the presidency.\n\nIn 2016 Amash made headlines by joining the list of Republicans who opposed the GOP nominee for President, Donald Trump. After Trump was elected president, the \"Huffington Post\" profiled him in an article with the following title, \"The One House Republican Who Can't Stop Criticizing Donald Trump.\" Amash said, \"I'm not here to represent a particular political party; I'm here to represent all of my constituents and to follow the Constitution.\"\n\nOn January 14, 2017, Trump sent out a series of tweets criticizing Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), one of the main leaders in the 1960s civil rights movement. Amash responded with a quick quip, \"Dude, just stop.\"\n\nOn April 1, 2017, senior White House aide Dan Scavino tweeted that Amash was \"a big liability\" and urged followers to \"defeat him in primary.\" Amash later referred to Trump as a \"childish bully,\" saying that his attacks would be \"constructive in the fifth grade. It may allow a child to get his way, but that's not how our government works.\" \nIn May 2017 Trump was accused of pressuring fired FBI director James Comey to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nAmash was reported as the first Republican congressman to publicly state that the allegations, if proven true, merited impeachment. This report is contested by the office of Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), who claims that he was the first to recognize that if true, the allegations merit impeachment.\n\nIn June 2018 the \"Huffington Post\" asked House Republicans, \"If the president pardoned himself, would they support impeachment?\" Amash was the only Republican who said \"definitively he would support impeachment...\" In July 2018 Amash strongly criticized Trump's press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Amash tweeted, \"The impression it left on me, a strong supporter of the meeting, is that 'something is not right here.' The president went out of his way to appear subordinate. He spoke more like the head of a vassal state.\"\n\nAmash and fellow U.S. Representative Ted W. Lieu (D-CA) introduced a bill to block the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) from financing its Cannabis Eradication Program through civil asset forfeitures.\n\nAccording to a DEA performance budget submitted to Congress for the fiscal year (FY) 2014, the DEA received $18 million in FY 2013 funding for cannabis eradication from the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture Fund. Amash took aim at civil asset forfeiture in a statement, saying that the practice allows for \"innocent people to have their property taken without sufficient due process\".\n\nAmash co-sponsored H.R. 1227, also known as the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017. The bill was introduced by U.S. Representative Thomas Garrett (R-VA).\n\nAmash supports decreasing U.S. military spending, and believes there is significant waste in the military spending of the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nHe believes only Congress has the power to declare war, criticizing President Obama's military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and intervention in Syria, for proceeding without a Congressional declaration of war.\n\nIn 2011, Amash was one of six members of Congress who voted \"Nay\" on House Resolution 268 reaffirming U.S. commitment to a negotiated settlement of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through direct Israeli–Palestinian negotiation, which passed with 407 members in support.\n\nIn 2014, he was one of eight members of Congress who voted \"Nay\" on a $225 million package to restock Israel's Iron Dome missile defenses, which passed with 398 members in support. He supports a two-state solution to the Palestinian–Israeli conflict.\n\nAmash joined 104 Democrats and 16 Republicans in voting against the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which specified the budget and expenditures of the Department of Defense, calling it \"one of the most anti-liberty pieces of legislation of our lifetime\". Amash co-sponsored an amendment to the NDAA that would ban indefinite military detention and military trials so that all terror suspects arrested in the United States would be tried in civilian courts.

Thomas Massie (R-KY), John Duncan Jr. (R-TN) and Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in opposing a bill that would impose new economic sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. President Trump opposed the bill, pointing out that relations with Russia were already \"at an all-time and dangerous low.\" He did, however, sign the bill though likely out of political pressure.\n\n\"Note\": This list is not complete. \n\n\n\n\nThe House Republican Steering Committee removed Amash from the House Budget Committee in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift.

{"id": "2313053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313053", "title": "Lisa Nowak", "text": "Lisa Nowak\n\nLisa Marie Nowak (née Caputo, born May 10, 1963) is an American former naval flight officer and NASA astronaut. Born in Washington, D.C., she was selected by NASA in 1996 and qualified as a mission specialist in robotics. Nowak flew aboard during the STS-121 mission in July 2006, where she was responsible for operating the robotic arms of the shuttle and the International Space Station.\n\nOn February 5, 2007, she was arrested in Orlando, Florida, and subsequently charged with the attempted kidnapping of U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who was romantically involved with astronaut William Oefelein. Nowak was released on bail, and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault, and battery. Her assignment to the space agency as an astronaut was terminated by NASA effective March 8, 2007. On November 10, 2009, Nowak agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of felony burglary of a car and misdemeanor battery.\n\nNowak remained a Navy captain until August 2010, when a naval board of inquiry, composed of three admirals, voted unanimously to reduce Nowak in rank to commander and to discharge her from the Navy under other than honorable conditions.\n\nLisa Nowak is the daughter of Alfredo and Jane Caputo of Rockville, Maryland.\n\nIn 1969, as a six-year-old watching the Apollo moon landings, Nowak first became interested in the space program. While growing up, she continued to follow the Space Shuttle program, particularly the introduction of female astronauts.\n\nIn 1981, Nowak graduated from Charles W. Woodward High School in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nIn 1985, Nowak received her Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the United States Naval Academy. \n\nIn 1992, Nowak earned both a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and a degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.\n\nIn 1985, Nowak received her commission in the United States Navy.\n\nIn 1987, Nowak became a Naval Flight Officer via the Tactical Navigation syllabus at Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Nowak was then assigned to Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron 34 (VAQ-34) at NAS Point Mugu, California, where she flew both the EA-7L and ERA-3B aircraft, supporting the U.S. Pacific Fleet in small and large-scale exercises with jamming and missile profiles.\n\nIn 1993, Nowak was selected for transfer to the Restricted Line as an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer, and to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.\n\nAfter graduating from the Naval Postgraduate School, Nowak stayed at Patuxent River working as an aircraft systems project officer at the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility and at Strike Aircraft Test Squadron, flying in the F/A-18 and EA-6B. She was then assigned to the Naval Air Systems Command, working on acquisition of new systems for naval aircraft, when she was selected for the astronaut program.\n\nNowak logged over 1,500 hours of flight in over 30 different aircraft during her career in the Navy.\n\nWhile in the Navy, Nowak was awarded the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal, and other service awards.\n\nOn 20 August 2010, after a review of the circumstances of the legal case, a panel of three U.S. Navy admirals recommended that she be discharged from the Navy and her rank reduced from Captain to Commander. Her service was classified as \"other than honorable\".\n\nNowak was selected to be an astronaut in 1996 and entered the NASA Astronaut Corps at Johnson Space Center in August of that year. She qualified as a mission specialist in robotics, and was assigned to a future mission designated STS-118. After schedule changes, she instead went into space on July 4, 2006, as a member of the STS-121 crew assigned to the International Space Station. Nowak served as mission flight engineer, operated the Shuttle's robotic arm during several spacewalks, and logged almost 13 days in space. For her work as a member of the crew of STS-118, Nowak was awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal at Johnson Space Center on June 5, 2007.\n\nOn February 6, 2007, following an arrest in Florida for attempted kidnapping, Nowak was placed on 30-day leave by NASA. She returned to Houston, Texas, on a commercial airline flight the next day and upon arrival was reportedly taken immediately under police escort to the Johnson Space Center for medical and psychiatric evaluation. Nowak's assignment to NASA as a serving Navy officer was terminated by the space agency on March 7, 2007.\n\nNowak remained on active duty with the Navy and was subsequently ordered to work on the staff of the chief of Naval Air Training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. There, she was involved in the development of flight training curricula for broad use throughout the Navy.\n\nNaval officials waited for her kidnapping case to be resolved before taking further action against her. Military law experts have stated that, while the Navy rarely brings charges against officers for adultery, it is seen as conduct unbecoming an officer, as it demonstrates bad judgment.\n\nNowak's state of mind during the incident was the subject of a play, \"Starcrosser's Cut\", which opened in Los Angeles in June 2013.\n\nIn 2017, at the age of 54, Nowak was reported to be living in Texas and working in the \"private sector\". Her attorney stated: \"She's doing well.\"\n\nIn 2018, pre-production began on a film, \"Pale Blue Dot\", based on the events of the case, with Natalie Portman expected to star as \"Lucy Cola\", a fictionalized version of Nowak.\n\nNowak married Richard T. Nowak, a classmate at both the U.S. Naval Academy and naval flight school, in 1988. Richard Nowak was employed by a contractor to NASA at Johnson Space Center while concurrently continuing to fly for the Navy as an officer in the Naval Air Reserve. The Nowaks have three children, a son born in 1992 and twin daughters born in 2001. A statement from the family indicated that the Nowaks separated in January 2007 and subsequently divorced.\n\nImmediately following William Oefelein's divorce, he and Lisa Nowak became involved with each other. Their affair lasted two years, with Oefelein beginning to break it off gradually near the end of 2006. It was during this time that Oefelein started a relationship with Colleen Shipman, who was working as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.\n\nNowak drove from Houston to Orlando, Florida, on February 4–5, 2007. She packed latex gloves, a black wig, a BB pistol and ammunition, pepper spray, a hooded tan trench coat, a drilling hammer, black gloves, rubber tubing, plastic garbage bags, approximately in cash, her computer, an Gerber folding knife and several other items before driving the to Florida. Early police reports indicated she wore Maximum Absorbency Garments during the trip, but she later denied wearing them. On February 5, 2007, Nowak went to the Orlando International Airport, waited for about an hour in the baggage claim, and then proceeded to the airport parking lot, where she located and confronted Shipman, who had just arrived from Houston by plane.\n\nShipman said that after arriving, she was aware of someone following her to an airport satellite parking area. When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being \"more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship\". Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.\n\nTwo fellow astronauts traveled to Florida for Nowak's arraignment to assist authorities and NASA personnel as needed: Captain Christopher Ferguson, the senior active duty Naval Officer in the NASA Astronaut Corps at the time, went as Nowak's commanding officer, and retired Air Force Colonel Steven Lindsey, who was the commander of Nowak's shuttle mission, STS-121, went as Chief of the Astronaut Office, the senior astronaut at NASA. On February 6, 2007, both appeared before a judge on her behalf. The state's attorney argued that the facts indicated a well thought out plan to kidnap and perhaps to injure Shipman. While arguing for pre-trial release Nowak's attorney remarked, \"One's good works must count for something\". Nowak was ordered released on $15,500 bail under the condition she wear a GPS tracking device and not contact Shipman. Before Nowak could be released, however, Orlando police charged Nowak with attempted first-degree murder and announced she would not be released on bail. Her lawyer alleged that police and prosecutors, unhappy that Nowak had been granted bail, pressed more serious charges solely to keep her confined to jail. In the second arraignment Nowak was charged with attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon, for which the judge raised bail by $10,000. After posting bail, Nowak was released from jail. Shipman dropped her request for a protection order on February 15.\n\nThere was widespread reaction to Nowak's arrest with concerns expressed about NASA's astronaut selection and screening process and planned 30-month missions to Mars. Some indicated that NASA's presentation of astronauts as heroes is part of the problem because of the social pressure. Some perceived her treatment in the criminal process as lenient. Others have been shocked that her criminal behavior has been the subject of parody.\n\nNASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin commissioned the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee, an independent panel, to examine how well NASA attended to the mental health of its astronauts. The initial report released by the panel raised questions in regards to possible alcohol use prior to flight. The report, however, offered no specifics, no facts to substantiate the claims, and stated that no attempt to confirm or investigate the allegations had been performed.\n\nShuttle Commander Scott Kelly was vocal in his criticism of the report during interviews prior to STS-118, stating it was beyond his comprehension that astronauts would ever consider what was suggested. Following the release of the independent panel report, NASA ordered an internal review, The Space Flight Safety Review.\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer Bryan O'Connor reported that after the month-long review, NASA found there was no evidence to verify the independent panel's report that astronauts have been allowed to fly drunk. Additionally, investigation into all incident reports dating from 1984 to 2007, found no incident involving alcohol or drug use. The report's findings specifically stated:\n\nIn response to the internal review, policies at NASA would be changed in a variety of ways: flight surgeons would be present during the pre-mission suit-up activities, flight surgeons would receive additional training in psychiatric evaluation, and although there was an unofficial code of conduct in place, an official \"Code of Conduct\" would be written up for employees.\n\nOn April 10, 2007, Florida prosecutors released additional material in the case. The previous week, the trial judge had agreed to unseal some of the documents that described items found in Nowak's car after her arrest. Among these items were a handwritten note on stationery listing Shipman's flight information and \"Flight Controller's Log\" paper with a handwritten list of more than 24 items, including sneakers, plastic gloves, contacts, cash, an umbrella, and black sweats. A floppy disk contained two photographs of Nowak riding in a bicycle race, and 15 images depicting an unidentified woman in different stages of undress. An evidence report dated March 15 indicated that nearly all of the photographs and drawings depicted scenes of bondage. Also found were $585.00 (USD) and £41.00 (GBP) in cash and 4 brown paper bags with 69 orange pills that were not publicly identified. Investigators also examined two USB drives found in the car. They contained family pictures, digital movies, and NASA-related materials. Investigators concluded that the information on the disk and USB drives did not have any direct relationship to the alleged kidnapping attempt.\n\nOefelein reportedly provided Nowak with a cell phone to communicate with him. Phone records show that she called him at least 12 times, and sent 7 text messages the day after he returned from his shuttle flight on December 22 that he did not retrieve until December 24 when they had a 7-minute conversation. During December and January, over 100 calls were recorded, although it is unclear who called whom. Under questioning by NASA and military investigators, Oefelein reportedly stated that he had broken off the relationship with Nowak. He did, however, have her to lunch in his apartment at least once in January, they continued to train together for a bicycle race, and they also went to the gym together.\n\nOn May 11, 2007, authorities released a surveillance video from the Orlando International Airport terminal purporting to show Nowak waiting for nearly an hour, standing near the baggage claim, then donning a trench coat and later following Shipman after she retrieved her bags.\n\nOn February 13, 2007, Nowak pleaded not guilty to the charges of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. On March 2, Florida prosecutors filed three formal charges against Nowak: (1) attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm or terrorize, (2) burglary of a conveyance with a weapon, and (3) battery. The prosecutors declined to file the attempted murder charge that had been recommended by Orlando police. Nowak formally entered a plea of not guilty to the kidnapping charges on March 22 at an arraignment hearing although she was not present in person. Nowak's attorney, who filed the plea with the Orange County court, requested a jury trial. The trial was originally due to commence on July 30, 2007, but was postponed until April 7, 2008, to allow the prosecution time to prepare for an anticipated insanity defense. On January 16, 2008, a judge postponed the trial, as well as the pre-trial hearing to be held on March 12, 2008, indefinitely, pending the outcome of the state's appeal of an earlier decision to suppress evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.\n\nA pre-trial hearing was held on July 17, 2007, and further hearings were to be held on September 19, to argue defense motions to suppress some of the evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.<ref name=\"Florida Today 4/9\"></ref> On August 12, 2007, Nowak asked to have her GPS ankle bracelet removed, which the judge agreed to on August 30. On August 28, the trial judge unsealed a court document indicating that Nowak intended to pursue an insanity defense. According to documents submitted by her lawyer, Nowak was evaluated by two psychiatrists who diagnosed her with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, Asperger syndrome, a single episode of major depressive disorder and a \"brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors\" at the time of the incident. On November 2, 2007, the trial judge suppressed Nowak's initial (pre-Miranda) statements to police, as well as all evidence found in her vehicle, citing police misconduct in their initial search and questioning. The prosecution appealed that ruling on November 8. A hearing on that appeal occurred on October 21, 2008.\n\nOn December 5, 2008, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal held that her statements were taken in violation of her \"Miranda\" rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because the police would have inevitably found it in the normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.\n\nOn May 15, 2009, it was reported that Nowak would not claim insanity if her case ever went to trial. Nowak's attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case. On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak's attorneys to take a second deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper-sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak's attorneys as to the factual basis for it. If it was found not to have occurred, Nowak's attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery to be dropped before trial began. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to lesser charges. She was sentenced to a year's probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.\n\nOn August 19, 2010, a Naval administrative panel of three admirals voted to recommend Nowak be separated from the U.S. Navy with an \"other than honorable\" discharge and that her rank be reduced from Captain to Commander. The panel's recommendation would be reviewed by the Naval Personnel Command and would ultimately be determined by the Secretary of the Navy.\n\nIn March 2011, Nowak petitioned the court to seal the record of her criminal proceedings, citing harm to her family and their livelihood. The motion was granted. On July 28, 2011, Assistant Secretary of Navy Juan M. Garcia III said in a statement that Nowak would retire with an \"other than honorable\" discharge and her pay grade would be reduced one rank.\n\nNowak's love triangle crimes were the subject of an episode of the US TV news series \"20/20\" entitled \"Over the Line\". The fictional episode \"Rocket Man\" of the police procedural \"\" was also loosely based on Nowak's story. In the \"30 Rock\" episode \"The Fighting Irish\", Liz Lemon makes a joke about traveling from Houston to Orlando in under 9 hours.\n\nIn the movie \"Rough Night\", the male protagonist Peter is recommended by his friends to enact the \"Sad Astronaut\", clearly referencing Nowak's road journey from Houston to Florida. A specific element of Nowak's journey (wearing of the adult diapers, which Nowak has since denied), is a plot point utilized in the movie, that has been cited as one of the film's most defining moments .\n\nThe song \"Road Trip\" by Molly Lewis is about Nowak's trip to Orlando and is sung from the inferred perspective of Nowak. Spanish punk pop band wrote a song about Nowak's road trip, \"Usted morirá en el espacio\" (\"You will die in space\"), included in their fifth studio album \"Alto Disco\" (Wild Punk Records, 2008). Nowak is also referenced in the Ben Folds song \"Cologne\" and the Common song \"Drivin' Me Wild\" (\"drivin' herself crazy / like the astronaut lady\"). In 2017, Katie Stelmanis portrayed Nowak in the music video for the Austra single \"I Love You More Than You Love Yourself\".\n\n\n"}

At the death of her brother, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon-Penthièvre, \"prince de Lamballe\", she became the wealthiest heiress in France prior to the French Revolution. She married Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, the \"regicide\" \"Philippe Égalité\", and was the mother of France's last king, Louis Philippe I, King of the French. She was sister-in-law to \"the princesse de Lamballe\", and was the last member of the \"Bourbon-Penthièvre\" family.\n\nMarie-Adélaïde was born on 13 March 1753 at the Hôtel de Toulouse, the family residence in Paris since 1712, when her grandfather, Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, bought it from Louis Phélypeaux de La Vrillière. Her mother died in childbirth the following year. Styled \"Mademoiselle d'Ivoy\" initially and, as a young girl, until her marriage, \"Mademoiselle de Penthièvre\" (derived from the duchy inherited by her father). The style of \"Mademoiselle de Penthièvre\" had been previously borne by her sister Marie Louise de Bourbon (1751–1753), who died six months after Marie-Adélaïde's birth.\n\nAt birth, she was put in the care of \"Madame de Sourcy\" and, as was the custom for many girls of the nobility, she was later raised at the Abbaye de Montmartre convent, overlooking Paris, where she spent twelve years. As a child, she was encouraged to take an active part in the charities for which her father had become known as \"Prince of the Poor\". His reputation for made him popular throughout France and, subsequently, saved him during the Revolution.\n\nUpon the death, on 8 May 1768, of her brother and only sibling, the Prince de Lamballe, Marie-Adélaïde became heiress to what was to become the largest fortune of France.\n\nHer marriage to Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres, son of the Duke of Orléans, had been envisaged earlier and, while the Duke of Penthièvre saw in it the opportunity for his daughter to marry the First Prince of the Blood Royal, the Orléanses did not want another union with an illegitimate branch of the royal family. However, when the Prince de Lamballe's death left his sister sole heiress to the family fortune, the bar sinister on her inescutcheon was \"overlooked\". Although Marie-Adélaîde was much in love with her Orléans cousin, Louis XV warned Penthièvre against such a marriage because of the reputation of the young Duke of Chartres as a libertine. Louis XV was also fearful of the powerful leverage given the Orléans branch should it inherit the Penthièvre fortune.\"You are wrong, my cousin, said Louis XV to Penthièvre, the Duke of Chartres has a bad temper, bad habits: he is a libertine, your daughter will not be happy. Do not rush, wait!\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Penthièvre\" was presented to the King on 7 December 1768, in a ceremony called \"de nubilité\", by her maternal aunt, Maria Fortunata d'Este, Comtesse de la Marche. She was greeted by Louis XV, the Dauphin and other members of the royal family. On that day, she was baptised by Charles Antoine de La Roche-Aymon, Grand Almoner of France, and given the names \"Louise Marie Adélaïde\".\n\nHer marriage to the Duke of Chartres took place at the Palace of Versailles on 5 April 1769 in a ceremony which all of the \"princes du sang\" attended. The marriage contract was signed by all members of the royal family. Afterwards, Louis XV hosted a wedding supper which included the entire royal family. \"Mlle de Penthièvre\" brought to the already wealthy House of Orléans a dowry of six million \"livres\", an annual income of 240,000 livres (later increased to 400,000), and the expectation of much more upon her father's death. \n\nDuring the first few months of their marriage, the couple appeared devoted to each other, but the duke went back to the life of \"libertinage\" he had led before his marriage.\n\nIn the summer of 1772, a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter, Philippe's secret liaison began with one of her ladies-in-waiting, Stéphanie Félicité Ducrest de St-Albin, Comtesse de Genlis, the niece of Madame de Montesson, the morganatic wife of Philippe's father. Passionate at first, the liaison cooled within a few months and, by the spring of 1773, was reported to be \"dead\". After the romantic affair was over, Félicité remained in the service of Marie-Adélaïde at the Palais-Royal, a trusted friend to both Marie-Adélaïde and Philippe. They both appreciated her intelligence and, in July 1779, she became the governess of the couple's twin daughters born in 1777.\n\nIn 1782, the young Louis Philippe was nine and in need of discipline. However, the Duke of Chartres could not think of someone better qualified to \"turn his sons over to\" than Mme de Genlis. Thus she became the \"gouverneur\" of the Duc and Duchesse de Chartres' children. Teacher and pupils left the Palais-Royal and went to live in a house built specially for them on the grounds of the Couvent des Dames de Bellechasse in Paris. Mme de Genlis was an excellent teacher, but like those of her former lover, the Duc de Chartres, her liberal political views made her unpopular with Queen Marie Antoinette. In the dissemination of her ideas, de Genlis managed to alienate her charges from their mother. \n\nMarie-Adélaïde began to object to the education given her children by her former lady-in-waiting. The relationship between the two women became unbearable when Louis-Philippe, on 2 November 1790, one month after his seventeenth birthday, joined the revolutionary Jacobin Club. Marie-Adélaïde's relationship with her husband was also at its worst at this point, and the only way the two would communicate was through letters. In the memoirs of the Baronne d'Oberkirch, Marie-Adélaïde is described as:\"...always wearing a melancholic expression which nothing could cure. She sometimes smiled, she never laughed...\"\n\nUpon the death of her father-in-law Louis Philippe d'Orléans in November 1785, her husband became the new Duke of Orléans, and First Prince of the Blood, taking rank only after the immediate family of the king. As the wife of a \"prince du sang\" she was entitled to be addressed as \"Your Serene Highness\", a style to which her own illegitimate branch of the Bourbons had no right.\n\nOn 5 April 1791, Marie-Adélaïde left her husband, and went to live with her father at the \"château de Bizy\" overlooking Vernon, Eure in Normandy In September 1792, having sided with the Revolution, the Duke of Orléans was elected to the National Convention under the name of \"Philippe Égalité\". Siding with the radical group called La Montagne, he was from the very beginning suspect in the eyes of the Girondists, who wanted all the Bourbons to be banished from France. The fate of the Orléans family was sealed when Marie-Adélaïde's eldest son, the duc de Chartres, \"Général Égalité\" in the Army of the North commanded by Charles François Dumouriez, sought political asylum from the Austrians in March 1793. On 6 April, all the members of the Orléans family still remaining in France were arrested. After their arrest in Paris, Philippe Égalité and his son, the comte de Beaujolais, were imprisoned in the prison de l'Abbaye in Paris.\n\nLater, the two were transferred to the prison of Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille, where they were soon joined by the duc de Montpensier who had been arrested while serving as an officer in the Army of the Alps. The day before his father and brothers were arrested in France, the duc de Chartres rushed to Tournai, near the French border, where his sister Adélaïde and Mme de Genlis had been living since Philippe Égalité had made them emigrate in November 1792. The duc de Chartres accompanied them to safety in Switzerland.\n\nIn the meantime, due to her poor health, Marie-Adélaïde was allowed to stay in France, under guard, at the château de Bizy, where her father had died a month earlier. Her inheritance, however, was confiscated by the revolutionary government.\nDespite having voted for the death of his cousin Louis XVI of France, and having denounced his son's defection, Philippe Égalité was guillotined on 6 November 1793. \n\nUpon the execution of her husband, Marie-Adélaïde, now known as the \"Veuve Égalité\" (\"Widow Égalité\"), was incarcerated at the Luxembourg Palace, which had been transformed into a prison during the Revolution. There she met the man who was to become the \"love of her life\", a former member of the National Convention named Jacques-Marie Rouzet, who had been imprisoned at the fall of the \"Girondins\". Nearly executed before the fall of Robespierre, in July 1794 at the end of the Reign of Terror, she was transferred to the \"Pension Belhomme\", a former mental institution turned into a \"prison for the rich\" during the Revolution.\n\nAfter Rouzet, who after his liberation had become a member of the Council of Five Hundred, succeeded, in 1796, to secure her liberation and that of her two sons still imprisoned in Marseille, the two always remained together and lived in Paris until 1797, when a decree banished the remaining members of the House of Bourbon from France. Marie-Adélaïde was exiled to Spain, as was her sister-in-law Bathilde d'Orléans, the last \"princesse de Condé\". Rouzet accompanied them to the Spanish border and managed to secretly join them in Barcelona where he became her chancellor, and she obtained for him the title of \"comte de Folmont\".\n\nMarie-Adélaïde was never to see her two younger sons again, Montpensier and Beaujolais, who died in exile before the 1814 Bourbon Restoration. She, Rouzet and the Orléans exiled in Spain returned to France in 1814 at the time of the first Bourbon Restoration. After legal battles which lasted until her death, the bulk of her inheritance was eventually recovered. She died in her castle at Ivry-sur-Seine on 23 June 1821, after battling breast cancer. Rouzet had died nine months before, on 25 October 1820, and she had him inhumed in the new family chapel she had built in Dreux in 1816, as the final resting place for the two families, Bourbon-Penthièvre and Orléans. The original Bourbon-Penthièvre family crypt in the Collégiale de Saint-Étienne de Dreux had been violated during the Revolution and the bodies thrown together into a grave in the Chanoines Cemetery of the Collégiale. She was buried in the new chapel which, after the accession to the throne of her son Louis Philippe, was enlarged, embellished and renamed \"Chapelle royale de Dreux\", becoming the necropolis for the now royal Orléans family. Marie Adélaïde did not live to see her son Louis Philippe become \"King of the French\" in 1830.\n\nIn the 2006 film, \"Marie Antoinette\", Marie-Adélaïde had a minor role played by actress Aurore Clément.\n\nThe couple had six children:\n\n\nOn the eve of the French Revolution, in 1789, she was painted by Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun, the favourite portrait painter of Queen Marie Antoinette. The painting was titled \"Madame la Duchesse d'Orléans\". Vigée-Le Brun made use of the lonely duchess' melancholia in the pose. Dressed in white, a reminder of her candor, the head of the duchess is supported on her upraised arm. She is shown with a languid, sad expression. Below the breast is a Wedgwood medallion which Colin Eisler has identified as \"Poor Maria\", possibly a reference to the life of the duchess, which was later destroyed because of the Revolution. The painting is now at the Palace of Versailles. There is another copy in the \"musée de Longchamp\", Marseille. Versailles has a third copy which has been incorrectly described as a replica. \n\n\n"}

Together with her husband, W. H. Kendal, she became an important theatre manager.\n\nKendal was born in Cleethorpes, reportedly the youngest of 22 children of Margharetta Elisabetta Robertson (née Marinus; died 1876), a native of Denmark, and her English husband, William Robertson (died 1872), who joined his wife's family of actors and became their manager in 1830. One of Kendal's brothers was T.W. Robertson, a dramatist who led the movement toward naturalistic acting and design in theatre. One of her sisters, Fanny Robertson, was also an actress. Kendal was home-schooled by a governess and her father, who read Shakespeare to her from an early age.\n\nIn 1854, Kendal had her first speaking role as Marie in the drama \"The Struggle for Gold\" by Edward Stirling under her father's management. She next appeared with her family as a blind girl, Jeannie, in the stage adaptation of \"The Seven Poor Travellers\" by Charles Dickens. Her family was engaged by in Bristol the next year, where Kendal played in an adaptation of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as Eva. Although she sang well as a child, she contracted diphtheria, and her voice suffered after the removal of her tonsils. Nevertheless, she played a singing role in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", with songs by Felix Mendelssohn, at the Bath Theatre in 1863, starring sisters Ellen and Kate Terry as Titania and Oberon, respectively. Throughout this period, she performed with her family in Bristol and Bath.\n\nIn 1865, Kendal was playing adult roles in London, beginning with Ophelia in \"Hamlet\", Blanche in \"King John\" and Desdemona in \"Othello\" at the Haymarket Theatre in London. She was Mary Meredith in \"Our American Cousin\" with Sothern, and Pauline to his Claud Melnotte. But her most notable early successes were at the Haymarket in Shakespearian revivals and the old English comedies. At the Haymarket, she starred with and met her future husband, W. H. Kendal, whom she married in 1869. Kendal played Rosalind, Lady Teazle, Lydia Languish and Kate Hardcastle, while her husband played Orlando, Charles Surface, Jack Absolute and Young Marlowe. The two thereafter acted mostly together. She then toured the provinces, joining the playwright and theatre manager William Brough and the actor Samuel Phelps in 1866 at the Theatre Royal, Hull. She substituted in the role of Lady Macbeth, for an actress who was ill, opposite Phelps, who engaged her to appear as Lady Teazle at the Standard Theatre, Shoreditch, opposite his Sir Peter in \"The School for Scandal\". During the following years, her reputation grew during engagements with F. B. Chatterton at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, E. A. Sothern at the Haymarket, and John Hollingshead at the Gaiety Theatre, London, as well as provincial appearances.\n\nIn 1868, Kendal joined the company of J. B. Buckstone on tour and then at the Haymarket, continuing with this troupe until 1874. She married William Hunter Grimston, an actor in the company who appeared under the name W. H. Kendal, on 7 August 1869, and adopted his stage name. With Buckstone's company, Madge Kendal enjoyed a string of successes, usually opposite her husband, playing as Lilian Vavasour in \"New Men and Old Acres\" by Tom Taylor (1869), Lydia Languish in \"The Rivals\" (1870), Rosalind in \"As You Like It\" (1871), and a series of \"fairy comedies\" by W. S. Gilbert, including Princess Zeolide in \"The Palace of Truth\" (1870), Galatea in \"Pygmalion and Galatea\" (1871), Selene in \"The Wicked World\" (1873) and the Lady Hilda in \"Broken Hearts\" (1875), and Mrs Van Brugh in his drama \"Charity\" (1874).\n\nAfter this, Kendal played at the Opera Comique and the Court Theatre, which they managed for a time before joining the company of the Bancrofts at the Prince of Wales's Theatre. There, she played Dora in \"Diplomacy\" by B. C. Stephenson and Clement Scott (1878, adapted from Victorien Sardou's \"Dora\"), among other roles. Between 1879 and 1888, Kendal and her husband managed the St. James's Theatre with John Hare and presented a large number of Arthur Wing Pinero plays, among many others. Mrs. Kendal played Lady Giovanna in \"The Falcon\" by Tennyson (1879), Susan in \"William and Susan\", Kate Verity in \"The Squire\" by Pinero (1881), repeated her Rosalind in \"As You Like It\" (1885). The Kendals restored the St. James's to popularity and helped to improve the respectability of the Victorian theatre, which had fallen into disrepute among the middle classes. They imposed a high moral code both on stage and behind the scenes.\nSome of the Kendals' other notable successes in the 1880s included \"The Squire\" by Arthur Wing Pinero, \"Impulse\" by B. C. Stephenson, \"The Ironmaster\", an English version by Pinero of \"Le Maitre des Forges\" by Georges Ohnet, and \"A Scrap of Paper\" by John Palgrave Simpson, an adaptation of \"Les Pattes de mouche\" by Sardou. In 1888, the Hare and Kendal partnership ended. George Bernard Shaw wrote of her 1886 performance in \"The Greatest of These\" by Sydney Grundy at the Garrick Theatre, \"her finish of execution, her individuality and charm of style, her appetisingly witty conception of her effects, her mastery of her art and of herself … are all there, making her still supreme among English actresses in high comedy.\" During this period, Kendal learned of the case of Joseph Merrick, referred to as the Elephant Man. Although she probably never met him in person, she helped to raise funds and public sympathy for him. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft, and she arranged for him to see a Christmas pantomime.\n\nThe Kendals made their American debut in \"A Scrap of Paper\" in 1889, and the success of their first tour in the United States was repeated in several successive American seasons, where they spent most of the next five years. In 1902, she appeared as Mistress Ford opposite the Mistress Page of her childhood friend Ellen Terry in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" with Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company. The Kendals continued to appear in popular plays without interruption until 1908, when they both retired, though Mrs Kendal reprised her Mistress Ford at the coronation gala of 1911 at His Majesty's Theatre.\n\nThe Kendals had five children, but they reportedly were estranged from them. Her husband died in 1917. In retirement, Madge Kendal became active with many theatre charities, becoming president of the actors' retirement home, Denville Hall. She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1926.\n\nKendal died at her home in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, in 1935, aged 87, after a long illness. She was buried at St Marylebone cemetery in East Finchley.\n\nKendal is a featured character in the 1979 play \"The Elephant Man\" and the unrelated 1980 film of the same name, both based on the life of Joseph Merrick. In the film, Kendal was portrayed by Anne Bancroft.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3034251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3034251", "title": "Military career of John Kerry", "text": "Military career of John Kerry\n\nThe military career of John Kerry occurred during the Vietnam War.\nKerry served as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy during the period from 1966 to 1970. His only tour in Vietnam was four months as officer in charge of a Swift boat in 1969. Kerry received several combat medals during this tour, including the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Kerry's military record received considerable attention during his political career, especially during his unsuccessful 2004 bid for the presidency.\n\nOn February 18, 1966, John Kerry enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He began his active duty military service on August 19, 1966. After completing sixteen weeks of Officer Candidate School at the U.S. Naval Training Center in Newport, Rhode Island, he received his commission on December 16, 1966.\n\nOn January 3, 1967, Kerry began a ten-week Officer Damage Control Course at the Naval Schools Command on Treasure Island, California. On March 22, 1967, he reported to the U.S. Fleet Anti-Air Warfare Training Center for training as a Combat Information Center Watch Officer.\n\nKerry's first tour of duty was as an ensign on the guided missile frigate USS \"Gridley\", beginning June 8, 1967. On February 9, 1968, the \"Gridley\" set sail for a Western Pacific deployment. The next day, Kerry requested duty in Vietnam, listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a Fast Patrol Craft (PCF), also known as a \"Swift boat.\" These 50-foot boats have aluminum hulls and have little or no armor, but are heavily armed and rely on speed. \"I didn't really want to get involved in the war,\" Kerry said in a book of Vietnam reminiscences published in 1986. \"When I signed up for the swift boats, they had very little to do with the war. They were engaged in coastal patrolling and that's what I thought I was going to be doing.\" However, Kerry's second choice of billet was in a river patrol boat, or PBR, squadron, which at the time was performing the more dangerous river duty.\n\nThe \"Gridley\" traveled to several places, including Wellington in New Zealand, Subic Bay in the Philippines, and the Gulf of Tonkin off North Vietnam. The executive officer of the \"Gridley\" has described the deployment: \"We deployed from San Diego to the Vietnam theatre in early 1968 after only a six-month turnaround and spent most of a four month deployment on rescue station in the Gulf of Tonkin, standing by to pick up downed aviators. It was a fairly grueling tour of duty. Our helicopter was shot up trying to rescue a downed pilot and the door gunner was killed. The crew performed well and John Kerry's performance in all aspects of his duty was outstanding.\" The ship departed for the U.S. on May 27, 1968, and returned to port at Long Beach, California on June 6. Ten days after returning, on June 16, Kerry was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant, junior grade. On June 20, he left the \"Gridley\" for special Swift boat training at the Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado.\n\nOn November 17, 1968, Kerry reported for duty at Coastal Squadron 1 in Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam. Kerry took part in Operation Sea Lords, the brainchild of Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. The goal was to project a U.S. military presence more aggressively into an area that had long been a Viet Cong stronghold. As part of that plan, the Swift boats were assigned to patrol the narrow waterways — inlets, canals, and coves — of the Mekong River delta, to monitor enemy movements, interdict enemy river-based supply lines, invite attack and otherwise draw out hostile forces.\n\nDuring his tour of duty as an Officer in Charge of Swift boats, Kerry led five-man crews on patrols into enemy-controlled areas. His first command was Swift boat PCF-44, from December 6, 1968, to January 21, 1969, when the crew was disbanded. They were based at Coastal Division 13 at Cat Lo from December 13 to January 6. Otherwise, they were stationed at Coastal Division 11 at An Thoi. On January 30, Kerry took charge of PCF-94 and its crew, which he led until he departed An Thoi on March 26 and the crew was disbanded.\n\nDuring the night of December 2, 1968, and early morning of December 3, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating in and around a peninsula north of Cam Ranh Bay together with a Swift boat (PCF-60). Kerry's boat surprised a group of men unloading sampans at a river crossing, who began to run. When the men refused to obey an order to stop running, Kerry and his crew of two enlisted men opened fire, destroyed the sampans, and took off. During this encounter, Kerry suffered a wound from a small piece of shrapnel in the left arm above the elbow.\n\nDr. Louis Letson, a member of the anti-Kerry group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT), claimed to have treated Kerry for this wound, but the sick bay report is signed by medical corpsman J.C. Carreon. According to Letson's account and the sick bay report, shrapnel was removed and the wounded area was treated with bacitracin antibiotic and bandaged. Kerry returned to duty the next day on a regular Swift boat patrol. Kerry was later awarded his first Purple Heart for this injury.\n\nKerry's opponents, including the SBVT, have contended that this wound was too minor to merit a Purple Heart. However, guidelines for a Purple Heart do not distinguish between degrees of injury; in addition, a 2004 review by the Navy inspector general concluded that Kerry's awards, including his first Purple Heart, were properly approved.\n\nAt the time, the U.S. military command in Vietnam had an established policy of \"free-fire zones\": areas in which soldiers were to shoot anyone moving around after curfew, without first making sure that they were hostile. Such encounters could result in the deaths of innocent civilians. Kerry has stated that he never thought he or his crew were at fault: \"There wasn't anybody in that area that didn't know you don't move at night, that you don't go out in a sampan on the rivers, and there's a curfew.\" Nevertheless, he soon concluded that the policy should be changed.\n\nOn January 22, 1969, Kerry and several other officers had an unusual meeting in Saigon with Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, the commander of U.S. Naval forces in Vietnam, and U.S. Army General Creighton Abrams, the overall commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam. Kerry and the other officers reported that the \"free-fire\" policy was alienating the Vietnamese and that the Swift boats' actions were not accomplishing their ostensible goal of interdicting Viet Cong supply lines. According to some who retell the story, Kerry and the other visiting officers' concerns were dismissed with what amounted to a pep talk. One of the other officers who participated later recalled, \"We all looked at each other and thought, 'What is this crap?'\" Kerry later said that the Saigon meeting left him \"more depressed than when I came.\"\n\nKerry received his second Purple Heart for action on the Bo De river on February 20, 1969. The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. They returned to their base to refuel and were unable to return to the mission for several hours. Kerry recorded the situation in his notebook: \"We therefore had a choice: to wait for what was not a confirmed return by the helos [and] give any snipers more time to set up an ambush for our exit or we could take a chance and exit immediately without any cover. We chose the latter.\"\n\nAs the Swift boats reached the Cua Lon river, Kerry's boat was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade round, and a piece of shrapnel hit Kerry's left leg. Thereafter, they had no more trouble, and reached the Gulf of Thailand safely. Kerry still has shrapnel in his left thigh because the doctors tending to him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with sutures rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel. Kerry received his second Purple Heart for this injury, but he did not take any time off from duty.\n\nOnly eight days later, on February 28, came the incident for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star. On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two others. Their mission included bringing a demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese soldiers to destroy enemy sampans, structures and bunkers. Along the Bay Hap river, they ran into an ambush. Kerry directed the boats \"to turn to the beach and charge the Viet Cong positions\" and he \"expertly directed\" his boat's fire and coordinated the deployment of the South Vietnamese troops, according to Admiral Zumwalt's original .\n\nAfter the South Vietnamese troops and a team of three U.S. Army advisors that were with them had disembarked at the ambush site, Kerry's boat and another headed up river to look for the fleeing enemy. The two boats came under fire from a Viet Cong B-40 rocket-propelled grenade, shattering the crew cabin windows of PCF-94. Kerry ordered the boats to turn and charge the second ambush site. As they reached the shore, a Viet Cong soldier jumped out of the brush, carrying a loaded B-40 launcher. With the enemy soldier only a short distance away from the boat and crew, forward gunner Tommy Belodeau shot him in the leg with the boat's 7.62×51mm caliber M-60 machine gun. \"Tommy in the pit tank winged him in the side of the legs as he was coming across,\" Fred Short said. \"But the guy didn't miss a stride. I mean, he did not break stride.\" Belodeau's machine gun jammed after he fired, and while crewmate Michael Medeiros attempted to fire, he was unable to do so. Kerry leaped ashore and, followed by Medeiros, pursued the man and killed him. The medal citation notes that Kerry \"then led an assault party and conducted a sweep of the area\" until the enemy had \"been completely routed.\" The mission was judged highly successful for having destroyed numerous targets and confiscated substantial combat supplies while sustaining no casualties.\n\nKerry's commanding officer, Lieutenant George Elliott, joked that he didn't know whether to court-martial him for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew. Elliott recommended Kerry for the Silver Star, and Zumwalt flew into An Thoi to personally award medals to Kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission. The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in the original signed by Zumwalt. In addition, the after-action reports for this mission are available, along with the original press release written on March 1, a historical summary dated March 17, and more.\n\nSources close to Kerry say the incident had a profound effect on him: \"It's the reason he gets so angry when his patriotism is challenged. It was a traumatic experience that's still with him, and he went through it for his country.\" It affects the way Kerry lives his life every day, the source said, since \"he knows he very well would not be alive today had he not taken the life of another man [he] never ever met.\"\n\nOn March 13, five Swift Boats were returning to base together on the Bay Hap river from their missions that day. A mine detonated directly beneath one of the boats (PCF-3), lifting it into the air. Shortly thereafter, another mine exploded near Kerry's boat (PCF-94). James Rassmann, a Green Beret advisor who was sitting on the deck of the pilothouse eating a cookie, was knocked overboard. Just afterwards, the boat came under attack from both sides of the bank. Rassmann dived to the bottom of the river. Repeatedly, when he came back up for air, the enemy fired at him. Rassmann was heading to the north bank, expecting to be taken prisoner, when Kerry realized he was gone and came back for him.\n\nThe Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in his medal citation:\n\nPCF-94 received special recognition from Captain Roy Hoffmann, the commander of Task Force 115 (which included Coastal Division 11), on March 14 in his weekly report to his men:\n\nAfter the dazed and injured crew of PCF-3 had been rescued, PCFs 43 and 23 left the scene to evacuate the four most seriously wounded sailors. PCFs 51 and 94 remained behind and helped salvage the stricken boat together with a damage-control party that had been immediately dispatched to the scene.\n\nKerry was slightly injured earlier in the day by shrapnel from a grenade tossed into a rice bin; he received contusions on his right forearm from hitting the bulkhead when the mine exploded near his boat during the later action. He received his third Purple Heart at this time.\n\nOn March 17, 1969, shortly after Kerry's third wound, Commodore Charles Horne, the commander of Coastal Squadron 1, filed for Kerry's reassignment to the U.S. per Kerry's request. He was entitled to this early departure from Vietnam (subject to approval by the Bureau of Naval Personnel), because those who had been wounded three times, \"regardless of the nature of the wound or treatment required ... will not be ordered to serve in Vietnam and contiguous waters or to duty with ships or units which have been alerted for movement to that area.\" According to the Navy regulation that governed this (BUPERS Instruction 1300.39), the request for the \"thrice-wounded reassignment\" was optional at the request of the wounded party and required requesting reassignment. Kerry requested reassignment and was granted his request.\n\nOn March 26, after a final patrol at night on March 25, Kerry was transferred to Cam Ranh Bay to await his orders. He was there for five or six days and left Vietnam in early April. On April 11, he reported to the Brooklyn-based Atlantic Military Sea Transportation Service, where he would remain on active duty for the following year as a personal aide to an officer, Rear Admiral Walter Schlech. On January 1, 1970, Kerry was promoted to full Lieutenant; on January 3, he requested discharge. He was released from active duty on March 1.\n\nAll told, John Kerry was on active duty in the U.S. Navy for three years and eight months, from August 1966 until March 1970. He continued to serve in the Navy Reserves until February, 1978. He lost five close friends in the war, including Yale classmate Richard Pershing, who was killed in action on February 17, 1968.\n\nOn November 21, 1969, Kerry requested an early release from active duty in order to become a candidate for Congress. The request was approved and he was released from active duty effective January 3, 1970, and transferred to the Ready Reserve (inactive). On March 1, 1972, the Navy offered Kerry the option of executing a written request to remain in the Ready Reserve or automatically being transferred to the Standby Reserve - Inactive; Kerry was subsequently transferred to the Standby Reserve - Inactive effective July 1, 1972. Kerry had no obligation to attend drills or contact the Navy other than to keep his address current.\n\nOn February 16, 1978, Kerry received an \"Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Naval Reserve,\" pursuant to former Section 1162 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code and \"in accordance with the approved recommendations of a board of officers convened under the authority of [former] Section 1163 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code to examine the official records of officers of the Naval Reserve on inactive duty and determine whether they should be retained on the rolls of the Reserve Component or separated from the naval service pursuant to the Secretarial instructions promulgated in [former] BUPERSMAN 3830300\".\n\nWith respect to Kerry's discharge from the Naval Reserve, Rowan Scarborough of the Washington Times wrote:\n\n\"A second charge is that Mr. Kerry did not successfully fulfill his time in the Reserves, so a special board had to be convened \nto determine what type of discharge he should receive.\n\nNavy documents show that in 1978, he received an \"honorable discharge certificate\" after a board of officers convened and reviewed his record.\n\nNavy officials say today that the board was standard operating procedure at that time for all reservists and does not indicate Mr. Kerry did \nanything wrong.\n\nAfter service just short of four years on active duty, Mr. Kerry transferred to the Ready Reserve and then in 1972 to the standby Reserve. \nHe was not required to attend drills under those two designations, says a Navy official who asked not to be named.The controversy remains active however, because Kerry's discharge was issued years after Kerry's reserve obligation ended, and occurred during the time of President Jimmy Carter's blanket amnesty and discharge upgrade program for Vietnam-era veterans who were discharged under less-than -honorable conditions for misconduct. Additionally, the discharge was processed by a Naval Board of Review, a procedure only utilized to upgrade less-than-honorable discharges, so the fact that Kerry's discharge went through such a process shows that it was a proverbial \"fresh coat of paint,\" over a bad discharge, according to veterans. Detractors contend that Kerry's ties to his fellow liberal political ally, then-President Carter, was behind the upgraded discharge. Carter was very sympathetic to the anti-war movement and had pardoned US deserters and draft-dodgers. Thus, he was suspected to have ordered an upgrading of the discharge. Otherwise, Kerry would have remained on record as a non-honorably discharged veteran. \"\n\nCritics have questioned several aspects of Kerry's military service.\nAs the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, around 200 Vietnam-era veterans formed the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT) and held press conferences, ran ads (financed in part by a major Republican party donor in Texas) and endorsed a book \"Unfit for Command\" questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. Several SBVT members were in the same unit with Kerry. SVPT member Stephen Gardner served on the same boat. Other SBVT members included two of Kerry's former commanding officers, Grant Hibbard and George Elliott. Hibbard and Elliott have alleged, respectively, that Kerry's first Purple Heart and Silver Star were undeserved. In addition, members of SBVT have questioned his other medals and his truthfulness in testimony about the war. Defenders of John Kerry's war record, who include nine of the ten living crewmen who served under him, have charged that organizers of SBVT had close ties to the Bush presidential campaign and that the accusations were false and politically motivated .\n"}

He is the first man to hold the post of regional director within UN Women and the only one thus far. A senior United Nations official, Naciri has served with the UN for more than two decades. Prior to his current appointment, he served as deputy regional director, Arab States, UN Women. He belongs to the Naciri family, a long-standing family in Morocco. Naciri has been engaged in addressing cultural and religious norms from a gendered perspective, creating space for partnerships with religious institutions such as He has spearheaded work on engaging men and boys as agents of change in the region, including through issuing a report on masculinities – the first of its kind in the Arab World. Naciri is a supporter of the arts. He has been supporting young and up and coming artists from the Arab world.\n\nNaciri was born in Rabat to a Moroccan father and an Egyptian mother. The Naciri family is a long-standing family in Morocco, whose members have held various positions in government, academia and the judiciary. The Naciri family is notably a large and ancient family of Saharan origin, present everywhere in Morocco. They are affiliated with their ancestor Mohamed Ben Nacer (hence their name) founder of the seventeenth century Sufi following bearing their name to Tamegroute and disciple of Abu Hafs Omar Bin Ahmed Al Ansari who instructed him to inculcate the principles of Tariqa Chadhiliyya.\n\nNotably, Naciri is the grand-nephew of Mohamed El Mekki Naciri, the former Moroccan ambassador to Libya, minister for religious endowments and the owner and chief editor of Al Alam newspaper, former head of Arrabita Al Mohammadia. He is the nephew of Khalid Naciri, the former minister of communication and the spokesperson of the Moroccan government. Naciri is also the first cousin of Salaheddine Mezouar, the former foreign minister of Morocco.\n\nHis maternal grandfather is Mohamed Ayoub, a senior member of the Egyptian government, a governor of the Eastern governorate from 1970 to 1975, and a founding member of the new delegation party in 1978.\n\nNaciri´s parents were travelling when growing up, he received his primary education in different countries, graduating from High School in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nNaciri has a master's degree in public policy and international development from the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University (United States) in 1997-1999.

Under his leadership, the regional office supported the convening of 45 Yemeni women from different factions to call for an engendered peace process, in his remarks to the meeting, Naciri said, \"Yemeni women have an opportunity to contribute in building peace, revitalizing dialogue, and helping Yemen get out from this dark tunnel. We are counting on Yemeni women’s wisdom to create a model that people will follow.\"\n\nHaving been appointed immediately after the Arab spring, much of Naciri's work on gender equality in the region focused on participation and leadership. \"We need to look on how can we sustain this participation,\" Naciri said. \"With women, with men, with the country at large, and the government, how can we prove that women's participation is of interest and benefit to the whole society.\"\n\nUnder his leadership, UN Women and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) launched regional research on the costing of violence. He has spearheaded work on engaging men and boys as agents of change in the region, including through issuing a report on masculinities – the first of its kind in the Arab World.\n\nNaciri has worked on expanding both the scope and partnerships of the regional office. A new concept note for a partnership initiative between Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), U.N. Women and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Women and ICTs is already under discussion and, according to Naciri, new expertise in this area will definitely be in demand in the future.\n\nNaciri has successfully established several partnerships with bilateral development partners, including the EU MADAD trust fund for Syria response, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Finland, Japan and the government of Norway to mention a few.\n\nNaciri has been engaged in addressing cultural and religious norms from a gendered perspective, creating space for partnerships with religious institutions such as . UN Women under his leadership successfully advocated for the abolishment of laws that gave clemency to rapists if they married their victims in Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nIn 2015 UN Women partnered with Dubai Lynx, the largest regional advertising festival to highlight violence against women, and encouraged young creatives to come up with a video brief on the issue. The regional office shed light on gender taboos through a mother's day campaign which went viral both in the region and beyond. The campaign, highlighting the shame associated with saying one's mother's name, resulted in thousands posting on social media in honor of their mothers.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Naciri was the deputy country director of the United Nations Development Programme in Yemen. During this time he managed a comprehensive development portfolio including good governance, poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability in line with UNDP strategic priorities and the Yemen development framework.\n\nHe was the acting UNDP Kuwait resident representative in 2008-2009, working on, among other things, women's empowerment and witnessing the election of female parliamentarians for the first time in the country´s history. He worked on the transparency index, and updating the fiscal policy of the Central Bank of Kuwait. He further worked with Kuwait on the aftermath of the environmental damages caused by the Iraq war through the burning of oil fields.\n\nNaciri first served with the International Organization For Migration (IOM) as a UN Junior Professional Officer Programme in Cambodia. Here he lobbied for recognition of the human trafficking atrocities taking place in the country, including supporting a public hearing in the US congress in 2003 for the US state department trafficking in persons report. Naciri raised 10 million USD for IOMs work on trafficking from the US government as a result of this.

{"id": "7202631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7202631", "title": "Niki Sanders", "text": "Niki Sanders\n\nNicole Sanders is a fictional character portrayed by Ali Larter in the television series \"Heroes\". Niki is the wife of D. L. Hawkins (Leonard Roberts) and mother of Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey). Niki, a sufferer of Dissociative Identity Disorder, displays superhuman strength, being able to literally rip others in half. Initially, she is able to access this power only when her alter ego \"Jessica\" is in control. Killed in an explosion to save Monica.\n\nTim Kring, the creator of the show, stated that he originally created Niki with the power to be in two places at once, which stems from her life as a single mother. Niki was also originally written to be a showgirl. However, Ali Larter did not have the proper physique to portray a showgirl, so the character's profession was changed to internet stripper. According to writers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coleite, Niki was written out of the series and replaced with Tracy Strauss so that Larter could play a different role, as they realized that they could not go further with the character. The change also allowed them to tell an origin story, where the character discovers that she has powers.\n\nOne of three identical triplets injected with Arthur Petrelli's formula as babies, Niki was adopted by a wealthy father named Hal Sanders. An abusive alcoholic, Hal would often beat Niki and her sister, Jessica, during his drunken rages. Eventually, Hal strangled Jessica to death and abandoned his remaining daughter. As an adult, Niki had no memory of her father's actions and simply believed he ran out on her. At some point in her life, Niki herself became an alcoholic and a problem gambler, but she managed to overcome her problems. On her first anniversary of sobriety, Niki attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. There, she was reunited with her father, Hal, who wanted to make amends. Niki introduced Hal to her husband, D. L., and her son, Micah. Hal gave the boy a computer, but when he became angry at his grandson for taking the expensive gift apart, Niki demanded that he leave. After her father's departure, Niki went to confront him as Jessica, claiming to remember everything he did to her, including his responsibility in her death (a memory Niki had apparently been suppressing). After assaulting him, she forced the check Hal gave Niki into his mouth and ordered him never to contact her again.\n\nAs of October 2006, Niki resides in Las Vegas and struggles to raise her ten-year-old son, Micah. She has been working as an internet stripper to pay the bills. Her husband, D. L. Hawkins, is in prison, accused of stealing two million dollars from a sports booker and murdering his own gang.\n\nTo help pay for Micah's tuition at a very expensive school that Niki believed would encourage his gifts, Niki borrowed money from Mr. Linderman (Malcolm McDowell), a mobster who once employed her husband.\n\nNot having enough money to continue paying tuition or repay the loan, she withdraws Micah from the school. The two go on the run, as they attempt to elude thugs and police that Linderman sends after her.\n\nDuring times of stress, Niki begins seeing her reflection in mirrors and other reflective surfaces moving differently from herself, leading her to be concerned about her sanity. After Linderman sends two thugs to her house to collect the money she owed him, an altercation occurs, with Niki apparently blacking out after being hit by one of the thugs. When Niki recovers consciousness some time later, she is shocked to find the two thugs dead and horribly mutilated. Niki has other blackout spells over the following days, one time losing four hours, always with no recollection of what has transpired. Niki eventually realizes that she possesses a split personality named Jessica, the other being far more sinister and amoral than her usual self, and which possesses superhuman strength.\n\nNiki is reunited with her husband D. L. after he escaped from jail in order to clear his name. Later, Jessica reveals that she was the one who stole the money, killed D. L.'s crew, and framed him, planning to use the money to give her son a better life and keep him away from D. L.'s influence. After a short but violent fight, in which D. L. reveals the phasing powers that he had used to escape from jail, Niki is defeated and lies unmoving on the floor while D. L. takes Micah away.\n\nThe next day, Niki recovers from her injuries and confides in her friend Tina about her dreams and her alternate personality. Jessica then resurfaces and tells Tina that Niki will no longer need Tina's help. That night Jessica answers a telephone call from Micah. She persuades Micah, who knows that she is not his mother, to tell her where he and D. L. are staying. Soon after that, Jessica purchases a sniper rifle, and goes in search of D. L. and Micah. When she finally finds them, she takes aim at D. L. from a hidden location across the street and attempts to kill him. Her first shot hits D. L. in the shoulder, but Jessica is unsuccessful at killing him. After a short chase through the woods, during which Niki fights Jessica for dominance, Jessica attempts to kill D. L. again. She inadvertently throws Micah against some rocks when he tries to restrain her. Horrified, Niki regains control. She apologizes to D. L. and Micah and explains to them her problem. Niki reveals that Jessica is stronger than she is, and that as a result, she can't be trusted. Concerned that Jessica will eventually take over and put her family in danger, Niki turns herself in to the police and confesses to murder.\n\nTwo weeks later, Niki is in prison, awaiting trial. She is returned to her cell after being in solitary confinement. The prison staff is very cautious, as Jessica has emerged previously and injured one of the guards during an attempted escape. During a meeting with the public defender assigned to her case, Niki is informed that the prosecution seeks the death penalty. Her lawyer asks Niki about the two million dollars, but she feigns ignorance. A rowdy Jessica then emerges to state that Niki is lying. Soon, Jessica recommends the lawyer bring in a \"shrink\" to analyze her apparent multiple personality disorder; Niki insists she's not crazy. Later, a meeting with D. L. and Micah indicates that D. L. gave Linderman back the two million dollars. D. L. regrets the whole situation, but Niki believes that it's for the best. She states that she still thinks of Jessica as a completely separate person and not an alter ego. Micah is very distressed by the whole situation and Niki asks the guard for permission to hug him. The guard denies her request, but Niki asks persistently, advancing on the guard as she does so. When the guard attempts to strike her with his nightstick, Niki grabs it and breaks it in half with her bare hands. She appears to be surprised after she does so, as there was no clear indication that the superhuman strength came from Jessica. A now straitjacketed Niki is sedated and placed in a room with padded walls.\n\nIn \"The Fix,\" Niki awakes to find the straitjacket removed, the drugs wearing off, and a psychologist, Dr. Witherson, looking at her. Niki insists that while the straitjacket is useless, the drugs make Jessica weak. The psychologist isn't interested in sedating Niki further, and believes she can help Niki. Niki is visited by D. L., who used his powers to enter her room and proposes breaking her out. D. L. states that he is having trouble raising Micah alone, but Niki is still resigned to her fate.\n\nAfter Niki gives him a bit of advice, D. L. leaves. Later, the psychologist comes back and Niki agrees to talk to her. The psychologist insists on talking to Jessica. Niki is opposed at first, but the thought of being able to see Micah and D. L. again eventually leads her to give it a chance. Niki reminisces about her sister Jessica's piano playing abilities due to the metronome that the psychologist is using to bring Jessica out. Jessica eventually comes out and attacks the psychologist repeatedly with the Taser that the other woman brought for protection. Later, while in her padded cell, a man walks into her cell and tells her to get dressed. When asked for an explanation, he tells Niki that a death row inmate has admitted to the killings for which she was being held and that DNA evidence verifies the inmate's story. Once home, Micah is clearly ecstatic to have his mother home and asks her to play a game with him. Appearing to be his mother, Jessica replies that she would enjoy that, and Niki is shown to be hitting a mirror, begging for release. Jessica merely looks at Niki and replies, \"You were the one who wanted to be locked up, Niki.\"\n\nJessica becomes Linderman's new assassin, and it is revealed that Linderman arranged to have Niki/Jessica released from prison. On Linderman's orders, Jessica kills a man by tearing him in two, throwing Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg) out of the window in the process. (When Niki and Jessica are fighting for dominance when Jessica is about to kill the target, Matt Parkman who possesses the power of telepathy, is able to hear them both in his mind, a fact which surprises Jessica. \"You heard Niki?\".)\n\nNiki manages to gain control a few times. She puts the photo of Nathan Petrelli, Jessica's next target, on D. L.'s pillow, which causes D. L. to question Jessica, who is still pretending to be Niki. Jessica lies and tells him that Linderman called to ask her to be a \"dealer\" at the casino. Jessica kisses D. L. and assures him that it is nothing more. He leaves the room but is still suspicious.\n\nJessica murders the two FBI agents, who are working with Nathan to take down Linderman. Later, Niki, who has managed to gain control once again, confronts Nathan in his room and confesses everything to him. She then advises Nathan to either take his family and run or to accept Linderman's offer. Nathan refuses, so Niki suggests that he kill Linderman instead. She gives Nathan a gun, which Jessica had intended to use on him. She tells Nathan that she does not have much time and begs him to knock her out so that Jessica can see that she is not in control anymore. Nathan complies.\n\nIn \".07%\", Jessica returns home from her failed assignment only to be confronted by D. L who questions her about which personality is dominant. However, Jessica is unsure. Linderman asks if he can borrow Micah for a few hours, given that he let the debt slide and he saved her from the gas chamber. Jessica coldly informs him that Micah stays out of all their affairs, and leaves. Linderman, however, sends Candice Wilmer to impersonate Jessica and give Micah permission to go with Linderman.\n\nIn \"The Hard Part\", Jessica and D. L. argue about their son Micah's whereabouts, and D. L. blames Jessica for his disappearance. He leaves, intending to rescue Micah without help. Niki pleads with Jessica to assist him, saying that he will die without her help.\n\nD. L. and Jessica phase through walls and into Linderman's office. They find detailed files on their whole family, including Micah. D. L. is angered to find that they had been used. The pair attempts to determine Micah's whereabouts, and find a painting of Micah in what appears to be a burning New York City.\n\nD. L. and Jessica make it to New York, where they work with Matt Parkman and Mr. Bennet to find Linderman. When D. L. and Jessica corner him, Linderman offers Jessica $20 million to kill D. L. Jessica seriously considers the offer, turning to D.L. and saying that she would kill him for that amount of money... but then she states \"Niki wouldn't\" and lets Niki take control once more. Niki hugs D. L. and apologizes. Linderman shoots at her but D. L. anticipates him and steps in front of Niki to protect her, taking the bullet. D. L. phases Niki out of the room after he kills Linderman. Niki then confronts Candice Wilmer, who impersonates Jessica. However, the real Jessica appears in a mirror shard to tell Niki she is not fighting her. Rather than take control, Jessica encourages Niki to fight herself and she is able to finally access her super strength as Niki and defeat Candice. Jessica then disappears from the mirror for good. As Niki later leaves the building with D. L., Molly, Mohinder, and Micah, she discovers Sylar and Peter in a showdown. When Sylar summons a parking meter with his telekinesis and strikes Peter down, Niki disarms him and slams his torso with the weapon. Peter, now capable of using Niki's super-strength, tells her to go back to her family. She does so, and then watches with D. L., Micah, and Molly Walker as Nathan flies Peter into the stratosphere to safely explode.\n\nAfter the events in the season finale, Bob from The Company approaches Niki in fear other personalities may emerge. She refuses his treatment so that she can be with Micah and D. L., who survived a gunshot wound to the chest. She begins taking medication, but stops when she experiences unpleasant side effects. On what is meant to be her first day of work at a new job, Gina, a new personality, appears, sealing Niki away. When D. L. tracks down Gina in L.A., whom he believes to be Jessica, she is dancing with another man. Upon seeing D. L., Niki returns. The two begin to leave, exchanging declarations of love for each other, when the same man dancing with Gina shows up and suddenly shoots D. L., killing him.\n\nNiki and Micah then leave Las Vegas. Niki leaves Micah with Nana Dawson, a relative of D. L.'s, and travels to The Company to seek a cure for her condition. A promise of service is extracted as payment. In \"Fight or Flight\", she attacks a company worker and Bob, forcing Mohinder to shoot her with a Taser. When Mohinder offers to help her escape, she stops him, explaining that she came to the Company voluntarily and they are trying to help her (\"I gave up my son to be here\"). Later, in the episode \"The Line\", she joins Mohinder as his partner, claiming to be cured. When Maury Parkman mounts an assault on the Company, he manages to corrupt her by using her nightmares against her. To stop herself, she injects herself with a modified form of the Shanti virus, which is soon discovered to be immune to the antibodies in Mohinder's blood. In the present at the end of \"Four Months Ago...\" she is released into the general population.\n\nIn \"Truth and Consequences\", Niki returns to Nana Dawson's house to be with Micah. One night, she gets a call from Mohinder saying he has found a cure and that he is coming to give it to her. She goes to tell Micah who is supposed to be sleeping, but finds an empty bed. In \"Powerless\", Micah convinces her to help save Monica from the gang that kidnapped her. Niki succeeds in rescuing Monica, but is unable to escape herself as the building explodes.\n\nIn \"One of Us, One of Them\", Niki is revealed to have died. In \"I Am Become Death\", it is revealed that Niki, Tracy Strauss, and Barbara are identical triplets that were separated at birth and had their genes modified to give them superhuman abilities.\n\nIn the graphic novel \"Walls, Part 1\", it is revealed that sometime after the explosion, Niki was placed in a prison for evolved humans and put under maximum security until Peter Petrelli and Hiro Nakamura rescued every prisoner, including her. She is also shown to have taken complete control over her body. Sometime after being freed in \"Five Years Gone\" it is revealed that her son and husband have been killed, Micah by the explosion and D. L. by Sylar. Because of this, Jessica has simply disappeared. Niki is involved in a relationship with Peter Petrelli and works as a barroom stripper under the stage name of \"Jessica\". She is often emotional and in pain, which only grows when she discovers that Peter caused the explosion and not Sylar, as she originally thought.\n\nNiki was not born with the genetic code for abilities, but was synthetically given powers under the Company's orders by Dr. Zimmerman. She has the ability of enhanced strength, allowing her to pull out the door of a safe box with her bare hands, throw her husband several feet across a small area with a single hit, break away from restraining cuffs that are \"strong enough to hold down an elephant\", and literally tear her opponents apart. She also displays signs of increased physical durability, being able to endure a blow from a shovel in \"Fallout\", only to stand back up again relatively unharmed, as well as able to endure the stress inflicted upon her body by her own strength (she does not, for example, injure her hand when punching through a solid wooden door). The ability is originally only used by her alter-ego, Jessica. In \"How to Stop an Exploding Man\", however, Niki is able to fully use her strength after some encouragement from Jessica.\n\nAs a side effect of her ability, Niki has \"alternate\" personalities. Jessica is one of these, named after Niki's late adoptive sister. At the start of the series, Jessica surfaces during times of great stress, but surfaces with increasing ease as the series moves on. When Jessica surfaces, the transformation is instantaneous and almost unnoticeable, but is made apparent by Niki's sudden violent and strong-willed behavior. Jessica also freely demonstrates the superhuman strength Niki has only recently unlocked. She also gains a peculiar tattoo resembling an RNA helix on her right shoulder. This helix symbol has been a recurring element in the series.\n\nJessica seems to have been aware that she is sharing Niki's body for longer than Niki realizes, leaving notes, gifts, and instructions for Niki, and telling a thug not to \"threaten \"our\" son.\" Niki becomes aware of Jessica with the aid of reflective surfaces such as mirrors, and begins communicating with her. Jessica's ability to surface seems to increase over time, as Jessica is able to actively surface more often and more easily than she does in early episodes. The blackout effect on Niki also seems to lessen over time; the two personalities often directly fight each other for control and seem aware of what is said even when they are not active.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Four Months Ago...\" that Jessica is not Niki's only personality. A third personality emerges: Gina, a pseudonym Niki assumed after she ran away to L.A. when she was younger. Whereas Jessica was originally triggered by the stresses of being a single mother and the need to protect herself and Micah, Gina seems to be a manifestation of Niki's suppressed desire to escape her responsibilities as a mother and wife.\n"}

{"id": "30856471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30856471", "title": "Seneb", "text": "Seneb\n\nSeneb was a dwarf who served as a high-ranking court official in the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, \"circa\" 2520 BC. Seneb was a person of considerable importance and wealth who owned thousands of cattle, held twenty palaces and religious titles and was married to a high-ranking priestess of average size with whom he had three children. His successful career and the lavishness of his burial arrangements are indicative of the acceptance given to dwarfs in ancient Egyptian society, whose texts advocated the acceptance and integration of those with physical disabilities.\n\nSeneb is depicted with his wife and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.\n\nSeneb was buried in a \"mastaba\" - a flat-roofed brick tomb – located in the West Field of the Giza Necropolis near modern Cairo, where a large complex of ancient Egyptian royal tombs and mortuary structures was built, including the Great Pyramid. It was rediscovered by the German archaeologist Hermann Junker in 1926. The tomb is situated close to that of another dwarf, Perniankhu, a high-ranking royal courtier who may have been Seneb's father. Its date was long uncertain but is now firmly attributed to the reign of Djedefre (2528–2520 BC). His wife's name also appears in the nearby tomb of an official, Ankh-ib, suggesting that the families of Seneb, Perniankhu and Ankh-ib may have been related. Seneb was apparently buried with his wife, but no trace remains of the bodies, and the tomb was looted long ago, like most of the others at Giza. It was one of the first known attempts at building a ceiling dome over a square chamber, with the dome resting on jutting bricks at the corners of the room.\n\nThe rectangular interior of Seneb's \"mastaba\" contained two cult niches with a false door and cavities containing stone chests. Three statues were found within the chests – the painted limestone sculpture of Seneb and his family and two other statues in wood and granite. The wooden one disintegrated when it was discovered but Junker recorded that it had been about high and depicted Seneb standing with a walking-staff in one hand and a sceptre in the other. The remnants of the wooden statue are now in the Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum Hildesheim in Germany, in a very fragmentary state; the outline of a curled wig can still be made out, as can the pose of the left arm, which was held forward at the elbow. Seneb's 1.5 ton sarcophagus is part of the collection of the Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig.\n\nThe limestone sculpture of Seneb and his family is part of the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senetites sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.\n\nTwo of the couple's children, one boy and one girl, stand below Seneb where the legs of an ordinary person would be. They are depicted nude with their index fingers placed in their mouths and a lock of hair falling on one side of their heads, indicating that they were below the age of puberty, when Egyptian children were given an \"adult\" haircut. Seneb and his son are shown with darker skin colouring than his wife and daughter. This was a standard artistic convention used to indicate gender and status, reflecting the fact that high-ranking females would remain indoors and retain a light skin colour while males would gain a darker skin from the hot Egyptian sun. The names of three children are recorded, though the third child was not depicted on the sculpture - presumably for reasons of symmetry. They were named after Seneb's royal masters; his son was called Radjedef-Ankh (\"May Radjedef live\"), his eldest daughter was Awib-Khufu (\"Happy is Khufu\") and his younger daughter was Smeret-Radjedef (\"Companion of Radjedef\"). They are depicted with normal proportions, suggesting that they did not inherit their father's condition.\n\nThe sculpture's roughly cubical arrangement cleverly ensures that the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting the children in the place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed on either side of the children and on the horizontal face of the base.\n\nSeneb's dwarfism is depicted realistically in the sculpture. It portrays him with a large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing parts of the body – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.\n\nSeneb's name means \"healthy\" – perhaps given by his mother as a wish for survival when he was a baby. Many Egyptians possessed similar names, not to denote an absence of disease but to convey a positive message of healthiness and vigour.\n\nDwarfism was not seen as a defect in ancient Egypt, unlike in many other cultures. Egyptian texts advised the acceptance of those with physical or mental disabilities, and there were even two dwarf gods, Bes and Ptah.\nA number of dwarfs gained prestigious roles and were given lavish burials in proximity to their royal masters. Seneb's career is documented on his false door and the plinths of his statues, which record twenty titles including \"beloved of the lord [king]\", \"overseer of weaving in the palace\", \"overseer of dwarfs\" (presumably indicating that there were others in the palace), \"overseer of the crew of the \"ks\" ship\" (referring to a ceremonial or cult boat), \"overseer of the \"jwḥw\"\" (possibly referring to animal-tenders), and \"keeper of the God's seal of the \"Wn-ḥr-b3w\" boat\" (referring to a papyrus bark used in certain festivals). His titles suggest that he might have started his career as an official in charge of royal linen and possibly also pets, a role in which other dwarfs are known to have served, and subsequently gained higher-ranking posts in charge of royal or cult boats. Alternatively, he could have been born into a high-ranking family and was given roles appropriate to his birth rank. Seneb also carried out religious rites in his dual role as a priest. He was titled \"Priest of Wadjet\", priest of \"the large bull which is at the head of \"Sṯpt\"\" and of the bull \"Mrḥw\". He participated in the funeral services for the Pharaohs Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid, and his successor Djedefre (Radjedef). His wife Senetites, a woman of normal stature, was likewise a priestess, serving the goddesses Hathor and Neith.\n\nSeneb's tomb reliefs and the false door of his tomb indicate his wealth and power. Seneb is described as the owner of several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter, sailing in a boat in the Nile Delta, or receiving his children. The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned with a name. He is depicted using what were evidently custom-made items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.\n\nAs with the sculpture, Seneb's size required the creator of the reliefs to make some unusual artistic choices. The standard convention of depicting higher status through physical size was maintained by portraying Seneb as being larger than his retainers, although this was clearly the opposite of the situation that actually existed. On the other hand, he is still shown with the physical characteristics of a dwarf. Unusually for such a relief, his wife is not pictured alongside him but appears separately. This may have been done to avoid the complications that would have arisen from needing to depict the couple's relative sizes realistically while still portraying Seneb as the larger party, as convention would have dictated. Seneb is also not shown carrying out typical male activities such as hunting, which was presumably impractical for someone of his stature, although one relief shows him pulling on papyrus reeds to guide his boat through the marshes of the Nile Delta.\n"}

{"id": "1118654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1118654", "title": "The Yes Men", "text": "The Yes Men\n\nThe Yes Men are a culture jamming activist duo and network of supporters created by Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos. Through actions of tactical media, the Yes Men primarily aim to raise awareness about problematic social and political issues. To date, the duo have produced three films: \"The Yes Men\" (2003), \"The Yes Men Fix the World\" (2009) and \"The Yes Men Are Revolting\" (2014). In these films, they impersonate entities that they dislike, a practice that they call \"identity correction\". The Yes Men operate under the mission statement that lies can expose truth. They create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof, which have led to numerous interview, conference, and TV talk show invitations. They espouse the belief that corporations and governmental organizations often act in dehumanizing ways toward the public. Elaborate props are sometimes part of the ruse (e.g. Survivaball), as shown in their 2003 DVD release \"The Yes Men\". The Yes Men have collaborated with other groups of similar interest, including Improv Everywhere, Andrew Boyd and Steve Lambert.\n\nAccording to Servin, the Yes Men concept initially sprang from their creation of a fake website spoofing the World Trade Organization. To the surprise of Servin and Vamos, many believed the site to be authentic, and the two were consequently contacted to speak at a conference in Austria. Since this time, the Yes Men have continued performing large-scale hoaxes, in what they describe as a collaborative effort with journalists to help the media tell stories which they believe are important.\n\nThe Yes Men often deploy a satirical approach: they pose as a powerful entity (typically a corporate or government representative or executive) and make ridiculous and shocking comments that caricature the ideological position of the organisation or person. Furthermore, they acknowledge the idea that many corporate or government entities manipulate their ideology using spin; in response, the Yes Men use this power of spin to their own advantage, and use media outlets to disseminate their personal interpretation of the situation. A sense of humor and shock value is usually employed to make these issues more palatable to the general public and to call greater media attention to stories of interest. Some of these outrageous ideas include the prospect of selling one's vote or a proposition that the poor should consume recycled human waste. On most occasions, little to no shock or outrage is publicly evoked in response to their prank.\n\nOn occasion, the Yes Men's phony spokesperson will make announcements that represent fictitious scenarios for the anti-globalization movement or opponents of corporate crime. This has often resulted in false news reports, such as those covering the demise of the World Trade Organization, or Dow Chemical paying compensation to the victims of the Bhopal disaster.\n\nThe Yes Men have posed as spokespeople for the WTO, McDonald's, Dow Chemical, and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The two leading members of the Yes Men are known by a number of aliases, most recently, and in film, Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno (Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, respectively). Servin is an author of experimental fiction, and was known for being the man who inserted images of men kissing in the computer game \"SimCopter\". Vamos is an associate professor of media arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. They are assisted by numerous people across the globe. There are other full-time members, such as Whitney Black and Rocco Ferrer, who take a more behind-the-scenes approach.\n\nTheir experiences were documented in the film \"The Yes Men\", distributed by United Artists, the film documentary \"info wars\", and the book \"\" (). Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno also directed a 2009 film entitled \"The Yes Men Fix the World\", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2009 they launched their online video channel on Babelgum.\n\nTheir third film, \"The Yes Men Are Revolting\", premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nOne of the Yes Men's first pranks was the satirical website www.gwbush.com, established for the 2000 US presidential election to draw attention to alleged hypocrisies on Bush's actual website. When asked about the site in a press conference on May 21, 1999, Bush responded that the website had gone too far in criticizing him.\n\nIn 2004, the Yes Men went on tour posing as the group \"Yes, Bush Can!\" and encouraged supporters to sign a \"Patriot Pledge\" agreeing to keep nuclear waste in their back yards and send their children off to war. They appeared at the 2004 Republican National Convention and drove across the country at first in an RV with a George W. Bush body wrap, and then in a painted van.\n\nThe Yes Men posed as working as part of the Bush-Cheney campaign. They carried around a petition asking for signatures to support global warming because America's competing countries will suffer while America only bears minor side effects.\n\nOn December 3, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, Andy Bichlbaum appeared on BBC World as \"Jude Finisterra\", a Dow Chemical spokesman. Dow is the owner of Union Carbide, the company responsible for the chemical disaster in Bhopal, India on December 3, 1984. An estimated 3,800 people died immediately from the hazardous chemicals and thousands more were killed by the plume from the UCC plant during the next few days. The Indian government reported that more than half a million people were exposed to the gas, leading to numerous early and late health defects. The Bhopal Disaster became one of the worst chemical disasters in history and the name Bhopal became synonymous with industrial catastrophe. Immediately after the disaster, UCC began attempts to dissociate itself from responsibility for the gas leak. The Indian Supreme Court eventually mediated a settlement in which UCC accepted moral responsibility and agreed to pay $470 million to the Indian government to be distributed to claimants as a full and final settlement. The average amount to families of the dead was $2,200.\n\nOn their fake Dow Chemical website, the Yes Men said that Dow Chemical Company had no intention whatsoever of repairing the damage. The real company received considerable backlash, and both the real Dow and the phony Dow denied the statements, but Dow took no real action.\n\nThe Yes Men decided to pressure Dow further, so as \"Finisterra,\" Bichlbaum went on the news to claim that Dow planned to liquidate Union Carbide and use the resulting $12 billion to pay for medical care, clean up the site, and fund research into the hazards of other Dow products. After two hours of wide coverage, Dow issued a press release denying the statement, ensuring even greater coverage of the phony news of a cleanup. In Frankfurt, Dow's share price fell 4.24 percent in 23 minutes, wiping $2 billion off its market value. The shares rebounded in Frankfurt after the BBC issued an on-air correction and apology. In New York, Dow Chemical's stock were little changed because of the early trading.\n\nAfter the original interview was revealed as a hoax, Bichlbaum appeared in a follow-up interview on the United Kingdom's Channel 4 news. During the interview he was asked if he had considered the emotions and reaction of the people of Bhopal when producing the hoax. According to the interviewer, \"there were many people in tears\" upon having learned of the hoax. Bichlbaum said that, in comparison, what distress he had caused the people was minimal to that for which Dow was responsible. The Yes Men claim on their website that they have been told by contacts in Bhopal that once they had got over their disappointment that it wasn't real, they were pleased about the stunt and thought it had helped to raise awareness of their plight.\n\nAt the International Payments Conference on April 28, 2005, 'Dow representative' \"Erastus Hamm\" unveiled Acceptable Risk, the Acceptable Risk Calculator, and the Acceptable Risk mascot — a life-sized golden skeleton named Gilda — to an audience of about 70 banking professionals.\n\nIn February 2012, it was widely reported in the 2012 Stratfor email leak that Dow Chemical Company hired private intelligence firm Stratfor to monitor the Yes Men.\n\nOne of the Yes Men's most famous pranks is placing a \"corrected\" WTO website at http://www.gatt.org/ (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). The fake site began to receive real emails from confused visitors, including invitations to address various elite groups on behalf of the WTO, to which they responded as if they were the actual WTO. \n\nAppearing in newly purchased suits, the Yes Men gave speeches encouraging corporations to buy votes directly from citizens. They argued that the US Civil War was a waste of money because Third World countries now willingly supply equivalent slaves. They also urged people to listen to the WTO instead of the facts. They then unveiled a gold spandex body suit that they claimed would allow productivity to increase, as managers would not have to oversee workers in person but could keep track of them via images on an attached screen as well as implanted sensors. \n\nThe Yes Men appeared on August 28, 2006 at a \"Housing Summit\" in New Orleans, taking the stage along with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. Before an audience composed mostly of real estate developers, one of the Yes Men gave a speech in which he claimed to be Rene Oswin, a fictitious \"assistant under-secretary\" at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In his speech he claimed that HUD would reopen public housing facilities that had been closed since Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005. He announced this false claim because HUD had recently decided to only rebuild a third of the subsidized housing stock after hurricane Katrina, and made plans to demolish four of New Orleans’ ten public housing developments, leaving thousands of New Orleans residents without homes. This decision was contested locally, nationally, and internationally. So, the Yes Men proclaimed that HUD had changed its mind about tearing down the undamaged housing units, and would not tear down the housing projects, as they had planned to do in order to replace them with mixed-income developments.\n\nHUD has called this prank, which brought attention to the lack of affordable housing, a \"cruel hoax.\" A former resident of the community was quoted by Bichlbaum as saying, \"do whatever's most effective, do it, don't worry about how it affects us,\" however. HUD spokeswoman Donna White said no one named \"Rene Oswin\" works for the department. White commented, \"I'm like, who the heck is that?\"\n\nThe fictitious Oswin also announced that the big oil companies would contribute some of their record profits to rebuild the wetlands destroyed by the construction of oil tanker canals to prevent the city from being inundated by future hurricanes.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, the Yes Men acted during Canada's largest oil conference in Calgary, Alberta, posing as ExxonMobil and National Petroleum Council (NPC) representatives. In front of more than 300 oilmen, the NPC was expected to deliver the long-awaited conclusions of a study commissioned by U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman. The NPC is headed by former ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond, who is also the chair of the study. When the Yes Men arrived at the conference they said that Lee Raymond (the promised speaker) was unable to make it due to a pressing situation with the president. The Yes Men then went on to give a presentation in place of Lee Raymond.\n\nIn the actual speech, the \"NPC rep\" announced that current U.S. and Canadian energy policies (notably the massive, carbon-intensive processing of Alberta's oil sands, and the development of liquid coal) are increasing the chances of huge global calamities. But he reassured the audience that in the worst-case scenario, the oil industry could \"keep fuel flowing\" by transforming the billions of people who would die into oil.\n\nThe project, called Vivoleum, would work in perfect synergy with the continued expansion of fossil fuel production. The oilmen listened to the lecture with attention, and then lit \"commemorative candles\". At this point, event security recognized the Yes Men and forced them off stage, and the 'punchline' — that the candles were made of Vivoleum obtained from the flesh of an \"Exxon janitor\" who died as a result of cleaning up a toxic spill — was not delivered to the audience, but only to reporters.\n\nIn July 2007, in order to obtain interviews with right wing think tanks, the Yes Men pretended to be filming a documentary about Milton Friedman. (In fact, their documentary, \"The Yes Men Fix the World\", did end up speaking about Friedman at length.) After interviewing members of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the American Enterprise Institute, several of whom appear in the film, the Yes Men were foiled at the Cato Institute by libertarian activists Bureaucrash, one of whose members had been hanging around the Competitive Enterprise Institute two days before and recognized the duo. On their way out, Bureaucrash members threw colored powder at the Yes Men in a reference to the rainbow.\n\nOn March 10, 2008, the Yes Men responded to a letter from BP (merged from British Petroleum and Amoco) accusing them of copyright violation, with a letter apologizing for having forgotten BP with the spoof site half-completed and that \"BP does every bit as much damage to this planet as does Exxon, Halliburton, or any other more obviously nefarious company\" and deserves its own properly completed spoof site.\n\nIn 1999, the Yes Men visited the offices of Twelve Star Communications, creators of the Eurofederalist superhero Captain Euro, \"a comic book character designed to promote European unification with young children.\" Inside, the impostors discover the hidden, dark truth about European Unification.\n\nThe Yes Men (along with the Anti-Advertising Agency) also claimed partial responsibility for a prank on November 12, 2008, where approximately 80,000 copies of a fake edition of the July 4, 2009 edition of \"The New York Times\" were handed out on the streets of New York and Los Angeles. The fake edition shows their ideas for a better future with headlines such as \"Iraq War Ends\" and \"Nation Sets Its Sights on Building Sane Economy\". The front page contained a spoofed motto, \"All the News We Hope to Print\" from the famous phrase \"All the news that's fit to print\". Articles in the paper announce dozens of new initiatives, including an establishment of national health care, a maximum wage for C.E.O.s and an article wherein George W. Bush accuses himself of treason for his actions during his years as president. There is also a Reuters photo of the fake cover page and a fake website, http://www.nytimes-se.com/.\n\nAlex S. Jones, a former \"Times\" reporter and media scholar, said of the paper, \"I would say if you’ve got one, hold on to it...it will probably be a collector’s item. I’m just glad someone thinks \"The New York Times\" print edition is worthy of an elaborate hoax. A Web spoof would have been infinitely easier. But creating a print newspaper and handing it out at subway stations? That takes a lot of effort.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2009, one day before a UN summit lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, over 2,000 volunteers distributed throughout New York City a 32-page \"special edition\" \"New York Post\", blaring headlines (cover story \"We're Screwed\") that the city could face deadly heat waves, extreme flooding, and other lethal effects of global warming within the next few decades. The paper had been created by the Yes Men and a coalition of activists as a wake-up call to action on climate change. Other articles describe the Pentagon's alarmed response to global warming, the U.S. government's minuscule response, China's advanced alternative energy program, and how the COP15 in Copenhagen could be a \"Flopenhagen\". There is also a fake website. A \"climate change horoscope\" satire on the Sally Brompton horoscope in the Post was commissioned from an environmental activist horoscope writer but was not published.\n\nOn September 22, 2009 the Yes Men demonstrated on the alleged behalf of Halliburton and dozens of other climate threatening corporations an inflatable ball-shaped costume known as the SurvivaBall, claiming it was a self-contained living system for surviving disasters caused by global warming. Over two dozen people wore the SurvivaBall costumes as it was demonstrated in the East River. Police shut down the demonstration for lack of a permit. Co-founder of the Yes Men, Andy Bichlbaum, was arrested on an outstanding parking ticket charge and a handful of other Yes Men were served with summons and tickets for disorderly behavior and creating hazardous conditions.\n\nThe SurvivaBall was also used in a protest at the steps of the capitol. The protesting balls demanded action be taken on global warming to achieve the 350.org goal. Their strategy was to block the entrance until the government comes to a binding agreement on climate change.\n\nOn October 19, 2009, the Yes Men spoofed the United States Chamber of Commerce, declaring a U-turn on their climate change policy. The Yes Men were not able to complete the conference without being exposed as a hoax, although their message that the United States Chamber of Commerce needs to reevaluate their direction in terms of clean energy was their primary concern and was received. Major TV and news organisations carried this story briefly before the hoax was uncovered. The US Chamber of Commerce two weeks later did change their official policy though, according to Al Gore it was \"not because of\" the Yes Men's stunt. The Chamber launched a trademark and copyright infringement lawsuit against The Yes Men, who were defended by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The suit was dropped in June 2013.\n\nThis action appears in their film, \"The Yes Men Are Revolting\".\n\nDuring the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, the Yes Men put out a statement in which they purported to be the Canadian environment minister, Jim Prentice. The statement pledged to cut carbon emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. The statement was followed by a response from the Ugandan delegation, praising the statement, that was also faked. Another fake statement was then put out blasting the falsehoods of the original fake statement. A fake story in a European edition of the \"Wall Street Journal\" was also posted online. Jim Prentice described the hoax as \"undesirable\".\n\nOn March 28, 2010, a video was released on YouTube with the title \"Shell: We are sorry\". A man called Bradford Houppe, from the Ethical Affairs Committee at Royal Dutch Shell gave a four-minute-long apology to the people of the Niger Delta for ruining their land, water, and communities.\nThis video was created in response to the numerous environmental problems and human rights violations that have occurred in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria since Shell began oil exploration in the region decades ago. Shell has yet to make any official statement about this video.\n\nOn April 13, 2011, a hoax website with a URL similar to that of the GE press domain (genewscenter.com) designed to look like the GE news center website. The hoax site posted the claim \"GE Responds to Public Outcry – Will Donate Entire $3.2 Billion Tax Refund to Help Offset Cuts and Save American Jobs.\" and it seems that the AP reported the story as fact, as reported by \"Good\".\n\nIn June 2012, the Yes Men collaborated with Greenpeace and members of the Occupy Seattle movement to create ArcticReady.com, a parody website criticizing Shell Oil's drilling activities in the arctic circle. The website launch was commemorated by a fake launch party held in the Seattle Space Needle. Shell Oil disavowed any affiliation with the website or the launch party on June 14, 2012.\n\nThe Action Switchboard is a platform the Yes Men launched to link up people who want to be involved in activism events with people organising them. As it says \"The Action Switchboard is a platform that helps activists find each other, come up with direct action ideas, and get the resources they need to pull them off.\"\n\nIn October 2015, at the annual Politicon non-partisan political convention, the Yes Men promoted an interview with whistleblower Edward Snowden, known to be living in exile in Russia. As they introduced the interview, they announced that Snowden had been pardoned and would join the group - in person! As Snowden appeared before them, people cheered, applauded and many rushed the stage for photos. A short time later, another Edward Snowden appeared on the giant screen - the real Edward Snowden… from Russia.\n\nIn July 2017, The Yes Men pranked the Democratic Party at Politicon. Following up the \"Better Deal\" agenda released by the party a week earlier, prankster Andy Bichlbaum posed as Frank Spencer, Deputy Vice Chair for Civic Engagement of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). As part of the new #DNCTakeBack campaign, Spencer pushed a more ambitious and progressive Democratic agenda, including: Medicare for all, tuition-free college, public campaign financing, stronger unions, an end to corporate lobbying and the end of for-profit prisons.\n\nIn November 2018, Motherboard/Vice released a video about The Yes Men and their fake VW \"Emissions Anonymous\" project. In the prank, they apologize to the public for the Dieselgate emissions scandal, in which several models and years of VW car family diesel autos were engineered and built with a rigged emissions system that ran clean only while under test conditions, but otherwise released high levels of air pollutants. The Houston Chronicle even covered the pranksters' April 2018 entry in Houston's annual Art Car Parade as if an official VW PR campaign: \"The marketing department has even turned the crisis into a publicity shtick\".\n\n"}

He can play as a central midfielder or right back. He has previously played for Reading, Basingstoke Town, Motherwell, Tranmere Rovers, Śląsk Wrocław and Dundee.\n\nHis father Mark played for many clubs including Coventry City, Portsmouth, A.C. Milan, Rangers and AS Monaco. Tom was born in Monaco.\n\nHis late grandfather, Tony, was also an English striker who played for many clubs including Notts County, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Birmingham City and Liverpool.\n\nHis father revealed in his \"Daily Record\" columns that he used to take Tom to Rangers dressing room before matches and used to warm up with goalkeeper Andy Goram when he was five years old. While growing up, Tom was a Rangers fan.\n\nHateley began his career at Reading, helping the reserve team to the national league title in the 2006–07 season. He was also the captain of the under-18 side during his time with the Royals. In the aftermath of the departure of Steve Coppell, he was one of several youngsters to be released by Reading in the summer of 2009. After being released by Reading, and after time at Basingstoke, Hateley had an extremely successful 4 years at Motherwell.\n\nIn late 2008, he joined Basingstoke Town on loan until the end of the season and featured in a FA Cup match against Bury Town. He made fifteen appearances in all for the Hampshire club. During that season, he also had a trial at Hamilton Academical. and he almost signed on loan, but Manager Billy Reid decided bringing him in due to a short spell of ill health at the time of trial.\n\nAfter being released by Reading, Hateley featured in a pre-season friendly for Basingstoke against Carshalton Athletic. He went on trial at Aldershot Town before being offered a trial with Scottish Premier League club Motherwell. Manager Jim Gannon offered the youngster a twelve-month deal with the option of a further year. He joined Motherwell on 13 August 2009, on a one-year contract. Set to start on the bench against St Johnstone, Hateley made his league debut unexpectedly as a late replacement for Paul Slane in a 2–2 draw. Hateley became an integral part of the Motherwell midfield during the 2009–10 season, offering additional defensive cover when required. He scored his first Motherwell goal with a free-kick against his father's former club Rangers in February 2010. After the match, Hateley said scoring against Rangers was the best goal of his career and that his dad even congratulated him. At the end of the season, he signed a new three-year contract, running until 2013.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, Hateley made his European debut, in the first round; first leg of the Europa League campaign, in a 1–0 win over Breiðablik. Then in the second leg, Hateley provided an assist for Jamie Murphy to send the club through to the next round. In the first leg of the Play-off round, Hateley scored his first European goal, in a 2–1 loss against Danish side OB. After scoring his first European goal, Hateley described it as a \"perfect moment\". But in the second leg, Motherwell would be eliminated after losing 1–0. Later in the season, Hateley would score twice in the league, against St Mirren and Hearts. Hateley was also in the starting up for the Scottish Cup final against Celtic, but Motherwell lost 3–0. After the match, he said the match had left him lost for words. At the conclusion of the 2010–11 season, Hateley had scored three goals in fifty-three appearances.\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, Hateley scored four goals in all competitions in forty-three appearances. In the 2012–13 season, Hateley made his Champions League debut, in a 3–0 loss against Greek side Panathinaikos. Hateley played in both-legs for the Champions League match. With his contract running out, Hateley said that he would consider staying at the club, saying that the prospect of the club qualifying for European football again could be a factor. Eventually, Motherwell qualified for the Europa League; however, Hateley was soon linked with a move to English side Doncaster Rovers. His contract talks with Motherwell soon broke down as he continued to be linked with many European clubs.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, Hateley left Motherwell after informing manager Stuart McCall that he would not return for pre-season training. This would end his four-year association with the club. In the summer transfer window, Hateley was linked a move back to Motherwell, something that was denied by McCall.\n\nOn 21 September 2013, Hateley moved to England by joining League One Tranmere Rovers on a 4-month contract.\n\nHe made his debut on the same day for the club in a 2–0 loss away at Notts County, he played the full 90 minutes whilst picking up a yellow card in the process. Four days later, he made his next appearance in the third round of the League Cup against Stoke City and despite losing 2–0, Hateley, along with three defenders, \"delivered solid displays in defence\". Hateley then played in central midfield, before a spell out of the team through injury.\n\nAfter four months, Hateley left the club at the end of his contract.\n\nOn 23 January 2014, Hateley left Tranmere Rovers to move abroad by joining Polish side Śląsk Wrocław on a two-and-a-half-year contract despite interest from Partick Thistle. Hateley had previously gone on trial with the club, which went successfully. Upon the move, he revealed his former Motherwell teammate Henrik Ojamaa had recommended he should move to Poland.\n\nHateley made his Ekstraklasa debut on 16 February 2014, in an away match against Lech Poznań.\n\nHateley signed a two-year contract with Dundee on 5 September 2016.

{"id": "1144566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1144566", "title": "Untersberg", "text": "Untersberg\n\nThe Untersberg is the northernmost massif of the Berchtesgaden Alps, a prominent spur straddling the border between Berchtesgaden, Germany and Salzburg, Austria. The highest peak of the table-top mountain is the Berchtesgaden Hochthron at . \n\nThe Untersberg rises at the rim of the Northern Limestone Alps, immediately at the Salzburg Basin and the broad Salzach Valley. Neighbouring peaks are the Hoher Göll in the southeast and Mt. Watzmann in the south, beyond the Berchtesgaden Basin. In the northwest, the Saalach Valley with Bad Reichenhall separates it from the Hochstaufen massif of the Chiemgau Alps. About two-thirds of the area, including the Berchtesgaden Hochthron peak, is located in Germany, while the northernmost steep edge above Salzburg belongs to Austria.\n\nThe mountain is a landmark popular with tourists, due to its proximity to the City of Salzburg: less than south of the city centre and within easy reach, e.g. by bus lines running to the southern suburbs of Grödig and Großgmain. \n\nSeveral trails lead to the top, though most people prefer the \"Untersbergbahn\" cable car. Constructed over a period of over two years, and opening in April 1961, the eight and a half minute journey lifts passengers from the lower terminus at the village of Sankt Leonhard at over to the top station on the Geiereck spur at an altitude of , transporting them a horizontal distance of almost with a maximum height above the ground of .\n\nThe first recorded ascent was in the first half of the 12th century, by Eberwein, a member of the Augustinian monastery at Berchtesgaden. \n\n\nThe Untersberg massif is mainly made up of limestone, a bed of Dachstein chalk—mined as \"Untersberg marble\"—on a dolostone basis, and of small deposits of bauxite. Untersberg marble also forms the facade of notable buildings such as Salzburg Cathedral.\n\nThe Karst topography of the limestone includes numerous caves. So far, more than 400 have been explored—including the Schellenberg ice cave at an elevation of , a show cave since 1925, and the Kolowrat Cave with a high dome. The Riesending cave with a depth of and a length of is the largest known in Germany. There also is a lake at depth. An expedition in August 2008 revealed that its lowest point had not yet been reached.\n\nFirst mentioned as \"Vndarnsperch\" (\"Noon Mountain\") in a 1306 deed issued by the Salzburg archbishops, the prominent spur has been the subject of numerous myths and legends. According to a popular king in the mountain tale, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa is asleep inside Mt. Untersberg until his resurrection. His beard is said to be growing longer and longer around a round table and to have grown round two times. Myth says that when the beard has grown three times around the table the end of the world has come. When Frederick leaves the mountain, there will be no further Holy Roman Emperor and the last great battle of humankind will be fought at the pear tree on the Walserfeld, a pasture near Wals, west of Salzburg. There is a similar legend for the Kyffhäuser Mountain in Thuringia and Trifels Castle.\n\nOther legends say that it is Charlemagne waiting inside the Untersberg, taken care of by the \"Untersberger Mandln\", small dwarf-like creatures. Every hundred years he awakes and when he sees the ravens (actually choughs) still flying around the Untersberg he sleeps for another century. Indeed, Charlemagne had held a synod at Salzburg in 803 AD, where he met with Bishop Arno. The Alpine tradition of the Untersberg Wild Hunt (\"Perchten\") has recently been revived. There are also several legends about the cave system below the mountain.\n\nThe landmark gained international fame as the \"distinctive, lopsided peak\" featured at the beginning and end of the 1965 movie \"The Sound of Music\", although the filming was done on the German side, not the Austrian side. It was where Julie Andrews sang \"The Hills Are Alive\" at the opening scene and where the family climbed the mountain on their escape to Switzerland at the end of the film.\n\nThe mountain also lends its name to an 1829 opera, \"Der Untersberg,\" by Johann Nepomuk von Poißl (1783–1865).\n\nThe Untersberger marble ball mills are located in Marktschellenberg in Berchtesgaden, at the opening of the Almbachklamm valley.\n\nThe \"Kügelmühlen\" (ball mills) were established in 1683. Once popular children's toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921.\n\nAs late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction.\n\nThe ball mills were driven by the waters of the Almbach river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After course grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.\n\n"}
{"id": "24336125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24336125", "title": "Uvavnuk", "text": "Uvavnuk\n\nUvavnuk was an Inuk woman born in the 19th century, now considered an oral poet. The story of how she became an \"angakkuq\" (spiritual healer), and the song that came to her, were collected by European explorers of Arctic Canada in the early 1920s. Her shamanistic poem-song, best known as \"Earth and the Great Weather\". has been anthologised many times.\n\nUvavnuk's story was written down by the explorer Knud Rasmussen, who grew up speaking Greenlandic, which is closely related to Inuktitut. Her story was told by Aua, a cousin of her son Niviatsian, both of whom were also spiritual healers. Aua acted as an informant for Rasmussen, who was collecting cultural material such as folktales and songs. \n\nThe two men met in February 1922, in the vicinity of Lyon Inlet, north of Hudson Bay. Given this location, Uvavnuk has been considered an \"Iglulingmiut\", a person from Iglulik. Aua was then living in a settlement of 16 people, all related to him and thus to Uvavnuk.\n\nRasmussen's version of her story appears in \"The Intellectual Culture of the Copper Eskimos\" (1932), also translated from the Danish as \"The Intellectual Culture of the Iglulik Eskimos\". This is the ninth in his ten-volume \"The Fifth Thule Expedition 1921-1924\". So the story was spoken in Inuktitut, written down and eventually published in Danish, and quickly translated into English for the publication of the international edition of his \"magnum opus\".\n\nAnother version of Uvavnuk's story was written by one of Rasmussen's companions on the Fifth Thule Expedition, Peter Freuchen. In his 1961 \"Book of Eskimos\", after half a century living in the Arctic, Freuchen tells the meteor story slightly differently, calling it \"grotesque in its mysticism\".\n\nRasmussen entitled this story \"Uvavnuk is struck by a ball of fire\", which he thinks is a meteor. This is the only story about her in that volume of the Thule Report; what is given below is the first translation from the Danish, by W. Worster.\n\nUvavnuk's story has been described and interpreted in detail from several angles. In a 1989 essay, Rudy Wiebe uses the story as \"a possible way to understanding, to developing an appreciation of Canada's Arctic.\". Novelist and critic Robert Kroetsch builds off this in \"An Arkeology of (My) Canadian Post-modern\", using it to justify sweeping statements such as \"The Arctic for Wiebe announces marginality on a grand scale, and marginality is the stuff of the Canadian experience.\" Kroetsch claims that Wiebe sees Uvavnuk \"not as an agent of transcendence or control but rather as a presence in the world\".\n\nBernard Saladin D'Anglure, a Canadian anthropologist and ethnographer who speaks Inuktitut, used Uvavnuk's story in 1994 as an example of \"a relationship between shamanism and the 'third gender' among the Inuit\". Canadian cultural anthropologist Barbara Tedlock links Uvavnuk's bodily possession (i.e. the unconsciousness) with the resulting shamanic knowledge. \"Mysticism: Experience, Response, and Empowerment\" (1996) describes Uvavnuk's experience in terms of \"telepathic sensitivity\" helping her know the \"thoughts and hidden actions of others\".\n\nThe words that Uvavnuk sang are known by several names: \"The Great Sea\", \"The Song of Uvavnuk\", \"Earth and the Great Weather\". There are an unknown number of versions in English, some via the Danish intermediary and some direct from Inuktitut, but poet John Robert Colombo says \"The song's power is such that its spirit vaults the hurdles of translation with ease.\"\n\nRasmussen's companion Freuchen, mentioned above, translates \"the longest and most moving\" version of the song, according to Colombo. In part:\n\nA translation by Tegoodlejak appears in \"Canadian Eskimo Art\" (1970) by James Houston. Tom Lowenstein, a British poet who for many years lived in the village of Point Hope, Alaska, translated and reprinted Uvavnuk's song in 1973.\n\nUvavnuk's poem has appeared in collections such as \"Northern Voices: Inuit Writing in English\" (1992), \"Women in praise of the sacred: forty-three centuries of spiritual poetry by women\" (edited by Jane Hirshfield in 1994) and \"The Enlightened Heart: An Anthology of Sacred Poetry\" (edited by Stephen Mitchell in 2009). \"Northern Voices\" (which, despite the subtitle, draws on oral poetry as well) was edited by literary scholar Penny Petrone as a pioneer work in the critical study of aboriginal literature in Canada.\n\nThe poem has been used as a touchstone in contexts as diverse as archaeology (\"The distance between an archeologist's experience of the world and that of a particular Inuk's in the past is vast.\" ) and a mystery novel set in modern Alaska. Susan Greenwood, author of \"Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld: An Anthropology\", calls the poem \"well-known\" when she draws on it to describe her understanding of the otherworld\n\nColombo begins \"Dark Visions: Personal Accounts of the Mysterious in Canada\" with Uvavnuk's song, citing it as an example of \"the interrelation between poetic impression and spiritual expression\". Outdoor educators have used the poem to link nature and culture.\n\nUvavnuk's song, in the original Inuktitut, was incorporated into work by American composer John Luther Adams, \"Earth and the Great Weather\" (1995), using her phrase as his title.\n\nAnother musical adaptation was in 2006, when Theodore Wiprud composed \"Three Mystical Choruses\" of five minutes each, based on texts by Rumi, Uvavnuk, and Mahavediyakka. This was a commission from Francisco Núñez for the Young People’s Chorus of New York. Wiprud compares Uvavnuk's experience to that of the Virgin Mary at the Magnificat.\n\nThe song was used by the peace group \"Out Beyond Ideas\" for a 2009 benefit album.\n\nThe 1995 \"Earth and the Great Weather\" recording was subsequently used in the Oscar-winning film \"The Revenant\" (2015), as a voiceover for a Pawnee character from the Great Plains thousands of kilometers away, even though the two languages bear no relation to one another.\n\n\n"}
