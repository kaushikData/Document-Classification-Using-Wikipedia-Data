In later years, he was heavily involved in charity work.\n\nThe Hon. Angus Ogilvy was born in London, the second son of the 12th Earl of Airlie and Lady Alexandra Coke, the daughter of the 3rd Earl of Leicester. Many of his relatives had close links with the British Royal Family. His grandmother, Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie, was a close friend and Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Mary. His father was a Lord-in-waiting to King George V and Lord Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother).\nHe was a second cousin of Diana Mosley, second cousin of Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk, and a second cousin once removed of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury. He was also third cousin, once removed of Pamela Harriman.\n\nOgilvy was educated at Heatherdown School, near Ascot in Berkshire; and later at Eton College (also in Berkshire). Between 1946 and 1948, while on National service, he was commissioned as an officer in the Scots Guards. In 1947 he attended Trinity College, Oxford, graduating in 1950 with a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.\n\nAfter university, Ogilvy worked at the Drayton company, later working with the tycoon Tiny Rowland in Drayton's subsidiary, London and Rhodesia Mining and Land Company (Lonrho). The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, criticised the company and described it in the House of Commons as \"an unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism\" on a 1973 court case over the company's management style. His career ended in 1976 after he was criticised in a Department of Trade report into the company's activities.\n\nOn 24 April 1963, Ogilvy married Princess Alexandra of Kent, a granddaughter of King George V and a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, at Westminster Abbey in London. The wedding ceremony was attended by all the members of the Royal Family and was broadcast worldwide on television, watched by an estimated 200 million people.\n\nThe Queen had offered Ogilvy an earldom on his wedding, which he declined. He also rejected a grace-and-favour apartment at one of the Royal Palaces. Instead, he leased Thatched House Lodge in Richmond, London from the Crown Estate for him and Princess Alexandra to live in, and where she still lives today. However, Princess Alexandra retained an apartment at St James's Palace, which is customary for the royal family.\n\nTogether, the couple had two children: \n\nOgilvy was created a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 31 December 1988 by Queen Elizabeth II. In the 1997 New Year Honours, he was made a Privy Counsellor.\n\nAfter his business career was blighted, Ogilvy was involved with charity work. He served as president of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, and as chairman of Youth Clubs UK, the biggest non-uniformed youth organisation in Britain. He was patron of Arthritis Care; vice-patron of the National Children's Homes; chairman of the advisory council of The Prince's Trust; a trustee of the Leeds Castle Foundation, as well as being a member of the governing council of Business in the Community, and of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He was also a member of the Royal Company of Archers, the Sovereign's Bodyguard in Scotland, in which his father served as one of its four lieutenants.\n\nHe suffered from throat cancer in later years and his last public appearance with his wife was when he accompanied her to Thailand for an official tour.\n\nOgilvy died in Kingston upon Thames, London, on 26 December 2004. His funeral took place at St. George's Chapel, Windsor in Windsor Castle on 5 January 2005. He was buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore at Windsor.\n\nOgilvy and his wife attended a special service at St Anne's Church, Kew, on Sunday 10 May 1964, to mark the church's 250th anniversary. Two pew cushions in the church are embroidered with their names and coats of arms.\n\n\n\n"}

In a book, \"Letters from Exile\", she compared these two schools and made conclusions that preferred parentally financed to state education. She won the Senior Open Scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford aged 17.\n\nIn 1960 she was awarded a B.Litt. degree from Oxford University's faculty of Literae Humaniores (Philosophy), for a thesis, supervised by H. H. Price, entitled \"An Enquiry into Some States of Consciousness and their Physiological Foundation\". From 1957 to 1960, Green held the post of Research Officer at the Society for Psychical Research in London. In 1961, Green founded and became the Director of the Institute of Psychophysical Research. The Institute's areas of interest were initially listed as philosophy, psychology, theoretical physics, and ESP. However, its principal work during the sixties and seventies concerned hallucinations and other quasi-perceptual experiences in normal subjects. Its main benefactor, from 1963 to 1970, was Cecil Harmsworth King, then Chairman of the IPC group, which owned the \"Daily Mirror\".\n\nIn 1996 Green was awarded a DPhil degree by the Oxford faculty of Literae Humaniores for a thesis on causation and the mind-body problem. Green is an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of Philosophy, University of Liverpool.\n\nGreen's basic philosophical position may be described as one of radical scepticism, based on a perception of what she calls 'the total uncertainty'. This perception leads her to agnostic positions, not just on traditional philosophical issues such as the nature of physical causation, but also on current social arrangements, such as state education and the monopolistic power of the medical profession, of both of which she is a relentless critic. Green writes in \"Letters from Exile\" and elsewhere of the damage which she believes can be done to exceptional children by holding back, rather than pushing, a topic which she regards as subject to extreme misrepresentation among current educational theorists.\n\nThere are also strong hereditarian and anti-feminist elements in her thinking. The former element may have been part of the reason she received support from the psychologist, the late Professor Hans Eysenck, who for a number of years was Director of the Institute of Psychophysical Research which Green founded.\n\nReinforcing the impression of someone out of sympathy with the modern Zeitgeist is Green's interest in the concepts of royalty and aristocracy. This interest appears to relate, not to their political significance, but to their symbolic power as representing certain ideals of responsibility and self-reliance. In several of her books Green develops a concept of ‘centralisation’, which is far removed from the ‘Californian’ concept of ‘centredness’, and has more to do with a heroic reaction to the perception that the human condition is intolerable, and that single-mindedness and urgency are the only appropriate responses.\n\nTo the extent that a conventional political position can be inferred from Green’s writings it would appear to be one of extreme libertarianism, and in fact a pamphlet of Green's on education was published in the 1990s by the Libertarian Alliance.\n\nGreen's most widely read philosophical book is probably \"The Human Evasion\", which has been translated into Dutch, German, Italian, and Russian. Its tone is somewhat different from Green's other books, being a curious combination of the oracular and the humorous. It consists almost entirely of a destructive analysis of twentieth century thinkers, from Wittgenstein to Tillich, but at the same time it seems to have a positive sub-text of its own, which is never made explicit.\n\nOn questions of ethics, Green proposes a distinction between tribal and territorial morality. The latter is largely negative and proscriptive: it defines a person’s territory, which is not to be invaded, stolen or damaged, such as his or her property, dependants and family. Outside this defined area territorial morality is permissive, leaving the individual free to have whatever wealth, opinions or behavioural habits that do not harm others.\n\nTribal morality, by contrast, Green characterises as prescriptive, imposing the norms of a group on the individual. Whereas territorial morality attempts to set up rigid, universal, abstract principles (such as Kant's categorical imperative), tribal morality is contingent, culturally determined, and 'flexible'.\n\nGreen links the rise of territorial morality to the development of the concept of private property, and eventually of market capitalism, including the primacy of contract over status. Her evident preference for territorial morality can be related to the centrality of the existential uncertainty in her thinking: under territorial morality it is prohibited to do good to someone against their will because it is impossible for another individual to know with certainty what is in that individual’s best interests.\n\nGreen’s empirical work, some of it undertaken in collaboration with an Oxford psychologist, Charles McCreery, has focussed mainly on hallucinatory experiences in ostensibly normal people.\n\nIn 1968 Green published \"Lucid Dreams\", a study of dreams in which the subject is aware that he or she is asleep and dreaming. The possibility of conscious insight during dreams had previously been treated with scepticism by some philosophers and psychologists. However, Green collated both previously published first-hand accounts and the results of longitudinal studies of four subjects of her own. She predicted that lucid dreams would be found to be correlated with the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, a prediction which was subsequently confirmed by experiment.\n\nGreen also speculated that it might be possible to set up a rudimentary two-way signalling system between the lucid dreamer and a waking observer, a possibility which was subsequently realised, independently of each other, by researchers in two different laboratories.\n\nIn 1968 Green published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of out-of-body experiences. In 1975 Green and McCreery published a similar taxonomy of 'apparitions', or hallucinations in which the viewpoint of the subject was not ostensibly displaced, based on a collection of 1500 first-hand accounts.\n\nGreen has put forward the idea that lucid dreams, out-of-body experiences and apparitional experiences have something in common, namely that in all three types of case the subject's field of perception is entirely replaced by a hallucinatory one. In the first two types of case she considers this self-evident from the nature of the experience, but in the case of apparitional experiences in the waking state the idea is far from obvious. The hypothesis, and the evidence and arguments for it, were first put forward in her book \"Apparitions\", and later developed in her book \"Lucid Dreaming, the Paradox of Consciousness during Sleep\", both of which she co-authored with McCreery.\n\nThis preoccupation with the extent of the hallucinatory element in various anomalous perceptual experiences is an indication that for Green the main interest of all these experiences is in the light they shed on normal perception, and on our theories of such perception, both philosophical and psychological. Prior to Green’s work these various hallucinatory phenomena had been of interest only to parapsychologists, who had studied them with a view to seeing, either whether they provided evidence for extra-sensory perception, or whether they shed light on the question of whether human beings could be said to survive death.\n\nOne of Green’s most distinctive contributions is to the form of the aphorism or epigram, the majority of her aphorisms being grouped together in two of her books, \"The Decline and Fall of Science\" and \"Advice to Clever Children\" . Ten are included in the \"Penguin Dictionary of Epigrams\", a relatively high number for a living author, and three in the \"Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations\". The aphorism, with its tendency to paradox and extreme compression, seems to be particularly suited to Green’s confrontational mode of thought. For example: ‘In an autocracy, one person has his way; in an aristocracy, a few people have their way; in a democracy, no one has his way.’ ‘People have been marrying and bringing up children for centuries now. Nothing has ever come of it.’ ‘The way to do research is to attack the facts at the point of greatest astonishment.’ \n\nBooks\n\n\nwith Charles McCreery:\n\n\nSelected papers\n\n\nTranslations\n\n\nIn 1995 Celia Green was involved in the release of a CD entitled Lucid Dreams 0096, narrated by Green for the label . Earlier Green had contributed a nine-minute track to a compilation CD put out by the same recording label. The track was entitled ‘In the Extreme’ and consisted of readings by the author from her books, \"The Human Evasion\", and \"Advice to Clever Children\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "63105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63105", "title": "Deborah Kerr", "text": "Deborah Kerr\n\nDeborah Jane Trimmer CBE (; 30 September 192116 October 2007), known professionally as Deborah Kerr, was a Scottish film, theatre and television actress. During her career, she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance as Anna Leonowens in the musical film \"The King and I\" (1956) and a Sarah Siddons Award for her performance as Laura Reynolds in the play \"Tea and Sympathy\" (a role she originated on Broadway). She was also a three-time winner of the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\n\nKerr was nominated six times for the Academy Award for Best Actress, more than any other actress without ever winning. In 1994, however, having already received honorary awards from the Cannes Film Festival and BAFTA, she received an Academy Honorary Award with a citation recognising her as \"an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance\". As well as \"The King and I\" (1956), her films include \"An Affair to Remember\", \"From Here to Eternity\", \"Quo Vadis\", \"The Innocents\", \"Black Narcissus\", \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\", \"King Solomon's Mines\", \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\", \"The Sundowners\", and \"Separate Tables\".\n\nDeborah Jane Trimmer was born in Glasgow, the only daughter of Kathleen Rose (née Smale) and Capt. Arthur Charles Kerr-Trimmer, a World War I veteran who lost a leg at the Battle of the Somme and later became a naval architect and civil engineer; She spent the first three years of her life in the nearby town of Helensburgh, where her parents lived with Deborah's grandparents in a house on West King Street. Kerr had a younger brother, Edmund (\"Teddy\"), who became a journalist. He was killed in a road rage incident in 2004.\n\nKerr was educated at the independent Northumberland House School, Henleaze in Bristol, and at Rossholme School, Weston-super-Mare. Kerr originally trained as a ballet dancer, first appearing on stage at Sadler's Wells in 1938. After changing careers, she soon found success as an actress. Her first acting teacher was her aunt, Phyllis Smale, who ran the Hicks-Smale Drama School in Bristol. She adopted the name Deborah Kerr on becoming a film actress (\"Kerr\" was a family name going back to the maternal grandmother of her grandfather Arthur Kerr-Trimmer).\n\nKerr's first stage appearance was at Weston-super-Mare in 1937, as \"Harlequin\" in the mime play \"Harlequin and Columbine\". She then went to the Sadler's Wells ballet school and in 1938 made her début in the corps de ballet in \"Prometheus\". After various walk-on parts in Shakespeare productions at the Open-Air Theatre in Regent's Park, London, she joined the Oxford Playhouse repertory company in 1940, playing, \"inter alia\", \"Margaret\" in \"Dear Brutus\" and \"Patty Moss\" in \"The Two Bouquets\".\n\nIn 1943, aged 21, Kerr made her West End début as \"Ellie Dunn\" in a revival of \"Heartbreak House\" at the Cambridge Theatre, stealing attention from stalwarts such as Edith Evans and Isabel Jeans. \"She has the rare gift\", wrote critic Beverley Baxter, \"of thinking her lines, not merely remembering them. The process of development from a romantic, silly girl to a hard, disillusioned woman in three hours was moving and convincing\".\n\nKerr returned to the London stage 29 years later, in many productions including the old-fashioned, \"The Day After the Fair\" (Lyric, 1972), a Peter Ustinov comedy, \"Overheard\" (Haymarket, 1981) and a revival of Emlyn Williams's \"The Corn is Green\". After her first London success in 1943, she toured England and Scotland in \"Heartbreak House\". Near the end of the Second World War, she also toured Holland, France, and Belgium for ENSA as \"Mrs Manningham\" in \"Angel Street\", and Britain (with Stewart Granger) in \"Gaslight\".\n\nHaving established herself as a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in Robert Anderson's \"Tea and Sympathy\", for which she received a Tony Award nomination. Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner John Kerr (no relation) in Vincente Minnelli's film adaptation of the drama. In 1955, Kerr won the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway début in 1953, she toured the United States with \"Tea and Sympathy\". In 1975, she returned to Broadway, creating the role of Nancy in Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Seascape\".\n\nIn 1977, she came back to the West End, playing the title role in a production of George Bernard Shaw's \"Candida\".\n\nThe theatre, despite her success in films, was always to remain Kerr's first love, even though going on stage filled her with trepidation:\n\nKerr's first film role was in the British production \"Contraband\" in 1940, but her scenes were edited out. With her next two British films—\"Major Barbara\" and \"Love on the Dole\" (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of \"Love on the Dole\", \"is not within a mile of Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star\". She went on to make \"Hatter's Castle\" (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in \"The Day Will Dawn\" (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.\n\nIn 1943, she played three women in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\". During the filming, according to Powell's autobiography, Powell and she became lovers: \"I realised that Deborah was both the ideal and the flesh-and-blood woman whom I had been searching for\". Kerr made clear that her surname should be pronounced the same as \"car\". To avoid confusion over pronunciation, Louis B. Mayer of MGM billed her as \"Kerr rhymes with Star!\"\n\nAlthough the British Army refused to co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—\"Colonel Blimp\" confounded critics when it proved to be an artistic and commercial success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, \"A Canterbury Tale\" (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it clear to him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.\n\nHer role as a troubled nun in the Powell and Pressburger production of \"Black Narcissus\" in 1947 did indeed bring her to the attention of Hollywood producers. The film was a hit in the US, as well as the UK, and Kerr won the New York Film Critics' Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth-most popular local star at the box office. Soon she received the first of her Academy Award nominations for \"Edward, My Son\", a 1949 drama set in England that co-starred Spencer Tracy.\n\nIn Hollywood, Kerr's British accent and manner led to a succession of roles portraying refined, reserved, and \"proper\" English ladies. Kerr, nevertheless, used any opportunity to discard her cool exterior. She starred in the 1950 adventure film \"King Solomon's Mines\", shot on location in Africa with Stewart Granger and Richard Carlson. This was immediately followed by her appearance in the religious epic \"Quo Vadis?\" (1951), shot at Cinecittà in Rome, in which she played the indomitable Lygia, a first-century Christian. She then played Princess Flavia in a remake of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1952). In 1953, Kerr \"showed her theatrical mettle\" as Portia in Joseph Mankiewicz's \"Julius Caesar\". She then departed from typecasting with a performance that brought out her sensuality, as \"Karen Holmes\", the embittered military wife in Fred Zinnemann's \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953), for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The American Film Institute acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which Burt Lancaster and she romped illicitly and passionately amidst crashing waves on a Hawaiian beach. The organisation ranked it 20th in its list of the 100 most romantic films of all time.\n\nThereafter, Kerr's career choices would make her known in Hollywood for her versatility as an actress. She played the repressed wife in \"The End of the Affair\" (1955), with Van Johnson; a nun in \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\" (1957) opposite her long-time friend Robert Mitchum; a mama's girl in \"Separate Tables\" (1958) opposite David Niven; and a governess in both \"The Chalk Garden\" (1964) and \"The Innocents\" (1961) where she plays a governess tormented by apparitions. She also portrayed an earthy Australian sheep-herder's wife in \"The Sundowners\" (1960) and appeared as lustful and beautiful screen enchantresses in both \"Beloved Infidel\" (1959) and \"Bonjour Tristesse\" (1958).\n\nAmong her most famous roles were Anna Leonowens in the film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \"The King and I\" (1956); and opposite Cary Grant as his shipboard romantic interest Terry McKay in the bittersweet love story \"An Affair to Remember\" (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, \"The Grass Is Greener\" (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, \"Marriage on the Rocks\" (1965). In 1966, the producers of \"Carry On Screaming!\" offered her a fee comparable to that paid to the rest of the cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of \"Flowers for Algernon\".\n\nIn 1967, Kerr appeared in the comedy \"Casino Royale\", achieving the distinction of being, at 46, the oldest \"Bond Girl\" in any James Bond film, until Monica Bellucci, at the age of 50, in \"Spectre\" (2015). In 1969, pressure of competition from younger, upcoming actresses made her agree to appear nude in John Frankenheimer's \"The Gypsy Moths\", the only nude scene in her career. Concern about the parts being offered to her, as well as the increasing amount of nudity included in films, led her to abandon the medium at the end of the 1960s in favour of television and theatre work.\n\nKerr experienced a career resurgence on television in the early 1980s when she played the role of the nurse—played by Elsa Lanchester in the 1957 movie—in \"Witness for the Prosecution\". Later, Kerr rejoined screen partner Robert Mitchum in \"Reunion at Fairborough\". She also took on the role of the older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of Barbara Taylor Bradford's \"A Woman of Substance\". For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an Emmy Award.\n\nKerr's first marriage was to Squadron Leader Anthony Bartley RAF on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently married to the actor John Shrapnel). The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success, and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.\n\nHer second marriage was to author Peter Viertel on 23 July 1960. In marrying Viertel, she became stepmother to Viertel's daughter, Christine Viertel. Although she long resided in Klosters, Switzerland and Marbella, Spain, she moved back to Britain to be closer to her own children as her health began to deteriorate. Her husband, however, continued to live in Marbella.\n\nKerr died aged 86 on 16 October 2007 at Botesdale, a village in county of Suffolk, England, from the effects of Parkinson's disease. Less than three weeks later on 4 November, her husband Peter Viertel died of cancer. At the time of Viertel's death, director Michael Scheingraber was filming the documentary \"Peter Viertel: Between the Lines\", which would include reminiscences concerning Kerr and the Academy Awards. \nKerr's body was buried in Alfold Cemetery, near Guildford, Surrey.\n\nKerr was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1998, but was unable to accept the honour in person because of ill health. She was also honoured in Hollywood, where she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1709 Vine Street for her contributions to the motion picture industry.\n\nKerr won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\" for \"The King and I\" in 1957 and a Henrietta Award for \"World Film Favorite – Female\". She was the first performer to win the New York Film Critics Circle Award for \"Best Actress\" three times (1947, 1957 and 1960).\n\nAlthough she never won a BAFTA, Oscar or Cannes Film Festival award in a competitive category, all three organisations gave Kerr honorary awards: a Cannes Film Festival Tribute in 1984; a BAFTA Special Award in 1991; and an Academy Honorary Award in 1994.\n\nIn September and October 2010, Josephine Botting of the British Film Institute curated the \"Deborah Kerr Season\", which included around twenty of her feature films and an exhibition of posters, memorabilia and personal items loaned by her family.\n\nDeborah Kerr was nominated six times for the Academy Award for Best Actress: \"Edward, My Son\" (1949), \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953), \"The King and I\" (1956), \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\" (1957), \"Separate Tables\" (1958) and \"The Sundowners\" (1960).

He was related to the famous Dutch anti-colonialism writer Multatuli, whose real name was Eduard Douwes Dekker (\"Douwes Dekker\" being their surname). In his youth, he fought in the Second Boer War in South Africa on the Boer side. His thoughts were highly influential in the early years of the Indonesian freedom movement.\n\nAfter Indonesian independence, he adopted the Sundanese name Danoedirdja Setiaboedi.\n\nDouwes Dekker was born in Pasuruan, in the north eastern city of Java, 80 km south of Surabaya. His father was Auguste Henri Edouard Douwes Dekker, a broker and bank agent, of a Dutch family living in the then-Dutch East Indies. His Indo (Eurasian) mother was Louisa Margaretha Neumann, of half-German and half-Javanese descent. Douwes Dekker's great-uncle was the famous writer Eduard Douwes Dekker, author of \"Max Havelaar\".\n\nAfter studying in Lower School in Pasuruan, he moved to Surabaya, and later to Batavia. In 1897, he gained his diploma and worked on a coffee plantation in Malang, East Java. Later he moved to a sugar plantation in Kraksaan, East Java. During his years in these plantations, he came in contact with ordinary Javanese and saw the realities of their hard work.\n\nIn 1900, along with his brothers Julius and Guido, he decided to volunteer for service in the Second Boer War. They arrived in Transvaal, and became citizens of that state. He based his actions on the belief that the Boers were victims of British expansionism, and as fellow descendant of the Dutch, he was obliged to help. In the course of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in an internment camp on Ceylon.\n\nDekker was later released and returned to the Dutch East Indies via Paris in 1903.\n\nIn the Dutch East Indies, Dekker, then still in his twenties, started a career as a journalist, first in Semarang and later in Batavia. There he worked with Indo activist Karel Zaalberg, the chief editor of the newspaper \"Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad\", whom he befriended. On 5 May 1903 he married Clara Charlotte Deije, who would bear him three children. Unlike other people of European descent, he did not favour colonialism, strongly advocating self-management, and finally the independence, of the Dutch East Indies. This was prompted partly by his experience in watching the lives of plantation workers and partly by discrimination he had suffered, through being only considered half-Dutch and a second-class citizen.\n\nDuring these times, he published many articles advocating independence, and \"Indies nationalism\". In 1913, close associates of Douwes Dekker, including physicians Tjipto Mangunkusumo and Suwardi Surjaningrat, established the Native Committee in Bandung, which later became the Indische Partij. This was considered a breakthrough, because most organisations had never so openly advocated independence. In March 1913, the party claimed approximately 7000 members, approximately 5500 of whom were Indos (people of mixed Dutch-Indonesian ancestry) along with 1500 native Indonesians. The Colonial government quickly became worried and the party was forbidden. This led to the exile to the Netherlands of Douwes Dekker and his two Javanese associates.\n\nIn exile, they worked with liberal Dutchmen and compatriot students. It is believed that the term \"Indonesia\" was first used in the name of an organization, the Indonesian Alliance of Students, with which they were associated during the early 1920s. After his party was forbidden it directly inspired the foundation of the Insulinde and an Indo-European party named 'Indo Europeesch Verbond' chaired by his friend Karel Zaalberg and also advocated independence. Many of the former 'Indische Partij' members joined the new party that grew to 10.000 members.\n\nIn 1918 he was allowed to return to the East Indies and was responsible for reforming the 'Insulinde' into the new 'National Indische Party' (NIP). Together with his new associate P.F. Dahler and old companion Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, he became a prominent leader of the NIP. After the NIP was involved in the Surakarta farmers' strike he was imprisoned again by the colonial authorities in 1921.\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1922, he taught in Bandung in a lower school. Two years later as head of the school, he renamed it the \"Ksatrian Institute\". This institute was officially recognised by the government in 1926. In the same year, he married Johanna Mussel, one of its teachers, six years after divorcing his first wife. Sukarno was a teacher at one of his schools.\nLater, however, his activities were branded illegal, and in 1936 he was condemned to three months in prison. He was still actively advocating independence and sharing his thoughts with other intellectuals, among them Sukarno, who considered Douwes Dekker as his teacher. Later, however, his influence was overshadowed by the politics of his student Sukarno's Indonesian National Party (PNI), Islamist Sarekat Islam, and Communist Party of Indonesia.\n\nDuring World War II, Dutch authorities, who considered him a dangerous activist, exiled him, along with many Indo-European of German descent, to Suriname. He would spend years in a forest prison camp called Jodensavanne.\n\nDekker returned to Indonesia on 2 January 1947.\n\nAfter he returned to Indonesia, he was appointed a member of the provisional parliament, or \"Komite Nasional Indonesia Pusat\" (\"Indonesian National Central Committee\"). In February 1947, he changed his name to \"Danudirja Setiabudi\" which means 'powerful substance, faithful spirit'. In 1947 he divorced his second wife and married the Indo European \"Nelly Alberta Kruymel\", who had changed her name to \"Haroemi Wanasita\", in an Islamic ceremony.\n\nIn December 1948 he was lifted from his sick bed and arrested by Dutch troops, but released due to his poor health.\n\nHe spent his last years in Bandung, writing his autobiography, \"70 Jaar Konsekwent\".\nOn his seventieth birthday to his delight he witnessed the formal Dutch transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia in 1949. He died eight months later in 1950.\n\nIn Dutch literature he is portrayed as a tragic and misunderstood historic figure. However, his legacy as a national hero is still appreciated in Indonesia; a district and a main street in Jakarta are named \"Setiabudi\" in his honour. In Bandung, there is also a main street called \"Setiabudi\", and another is named \"Ksatrian\" after his school. He was recognized as National Hero by President Sukarno. His life is recorded in a biography, \"'Het Leven van EFE Douwes Dekker\", by Frans Glissenaar in 1999.\n\n\n\n"}

Foresters engage in a broad range of activities including ecological restoration and management of protected areas. Foresters manage forests to provide a variety of objectives including direct extraction of raw material, outdoor recreation, conservation, hunting and aesthetics. Emerging management practices include managing forestlands for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and air quality.\n\nMany people confuse the role of the forester with that of the logger, but most foresters are concerned not only with the harvest of timber, but also with the sustainable management of forests to (in the words of Gifford Pinchot) \"provide the greatest good for the greatest number in the long term\". Another notable forester, Jack C. Westoby, remarked that \"forestry is concerned not with trees, but with how trees can serve people\".\n\nThe median salary of foresters in the United States was $53,750, in 2008. Beginning foresters without bachelor's degrees make considerably less. Those with master's degrees are able to command salaries closer to the average. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation considers the Society of American Foresters as the principal accreditor for academic degree programs in professional forestry, both at a Bachelor's and Master's level.\n\nUsually a bachelor's degree is considered the minimum education required, but some individuals are able to secure a job without a college education based on their experience. Some states have a licensing requirement for foresters, and most of those require at least a four-year degree.\n\nForesters are often employed by private industry, federal and state land management agencies, or private consulting firms.\n\nForester was also a title used widely during Medieval times. The forester usually held a position equal to a sheriff or local law enforcer, and he could act as a barrister or arbiter. He was often based in a forester's lodge, and was responsible for patrolling the woodlands on a lord or noble's property, hence the synonymous term 'woodward'. His duties included negotiating sales of lumber and timber and stopping poachers from illegally hunting. Frequently outlaws would take refuge in heavily wooded regions. When this occurred it was the duty of the forester to organize armed posses to capture or disperse the criminals. The pay and status of foresters was usually above average, reflecting the responsibility of their role in a medieval environment and economy.\n\n\n"}

Her grandparents, whom she was visiting in Aldersgate, sent her to a private school housed in the most basic accommodation \"...to get me out of the way\". Next she was sent to a similar school in Kentish Town which she remembered as simply consisting of children learning Murray's \"Grammar\". Aged 10 she attended a more advanced school in Hampstead; by the age of fourteen she herself was teaching there and by sixteen she was occasionally left in charge of the school.\n\nHer father's career as an artist being at times unsuccessful, to help the family finances her mother set up a private school in Clarence Road, Kentish Town, in 1845, at which Frances assisted, and which was based on the ideas of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.\n\nDuring 1848–9, she attended evening lectures at the newly opened Queen's College in Harley Street, London. She was taught by F. D. Maurice, Charles Kingsley, and R. C. Trench, and gained certificates in French, German and Geography. To Dorothea Beale, a contemporary at Queen's, she described the education she had gained there as opening 'a new life to me, I mean intellectually'.\n\nThe school was renamed the North London Collegiate School for Ladies and moved to larger premises in Camden Street on 4 April 1850. Buss was its first Headmistress and remained so for the rest of her life. Under her headship, and with the help of family members, the school became a model for girls' education. By 1865 the school had 200 day girls, with a few boarders, but was still run as a private, family concern, with her father Robert William Buss and her brother Septimus Buss teaching Art and Scripture respectively.\n\nIn July 1870 Frances Mary Buss handed over the school to trustees, and in the following year she founded the Camden School for Girls with the aim of offering more affordable education for girls. She was the first person ever to use the title Headmistress.\n\nBuss was at the forefront of campaigns for the endowment of girls' schools, and for girls to be allowed to sit public examinations and to enter universities. She became the founding president of the Association of Head Mistresses in 1874, a position she held until 1894, and was also involved in establishing the Teachers' Guild in 1883 and the Cambridge Training College (later Hughes Hall) for training teachers in 1885.\n\nIn 1869 she became the first woman Fellow of the College of Preceptors, helping to establish the College's professorship of the science and art of education in 1872. Her election to a Fellowship of the College in 1873 was the only public recognition she ever received. She was also a member of the Council of the Teachers' Training and Registration Society.\n\nBuss was also a suffragist, participating in the Kensington Society, a woman's discussion society, and the London Suffrage Committee.\n\nShe is buried in the churchyard of Theydon Bois in Essex.\n\nHer name is associated with that of Dorothea Beale in a satirical rhyme:\n\n<poem>\nMiss Buss and Miss Beale,\nCupid's darts do not feel.\nHow different from us,\nMiss Beale and Miss Buss.\n</poem>\n\nIn the spring of each year North London Collegiate School, North London Collegiate School Jeju (in South Korea) and Camden School for Girls all hold Founder's Day to commemorate Frances Mary Buss and her legacy. Pupils, staff and guests each carry a daffodil in memory of Miss Buss's favourite flower.\n\nThe educational values that Frances Mary Buss taught at the North London Collegiate School became the model for many schools throughout the UK and overseas. This included Pretoria High School for Girls, founded in South Africa by Edith Aitken, a former pupil of Miss Buss.\n\n"}

In January 1945, Oertel escaped from the advancing Red Army with his parents, milling director Egon Oertel and his wife Margarete (née Wittek) westwards, initially to Gransee in Brandenburg, then continuing to Triptis in Thuringia which was captured by US forces rather than the Soviets. When Thuringia fell under Soviet control in the course of the Potsdam Agreement, the flight continued by horse and carriage, further westwards to Öhringen in southwestern Württemberg. Goetz's father was able to support the family through his hobby, genealogy. His hometown, lying east of the Oder–Neisse line, was transferred to Poland after the war.\n\nAfter the Abitur at the Robert-Mayer-High School in Heilbronn and first work experiences in the private economy at the energy corporation AEG in Stuttgart, Oertel commenced his studies of physics at the Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel in 1953. A son of a member of the Corps (student fraternity) Masovia, he equally sought membership in the Kiel Corps Palaiomarchia-Masovia, where he sustained in four fencing duels.\n\nGoetz followed his supervisor of his doctoral thesis to the US in 1957 with a Fulbright stipend, and got a position as physics research associate at the University of Maryland. He married Brigitte Beckmann in 1960, and became neighbor as well as friends with Karl-Ludwig Stellmacher, a German – American mathematician.\n\nAfter his successful PhD promotion he was hired by NASA in January 1963 at their Langley Research Center as a researcher. The agency promoted his naturalization to US citizenship and provided him with responsibility over a current research project. He had to convince the NASA and General Electric engineers that the project was unviable and had to be restructured substantially. At the same time, his experimental research results from his PhD thesis became published and resulted in the application for two patents.\n\nIn 1967, the NASA HQ offered Goetz Oertel a senior position in Washington, D.C. and thus enabled a continuation of his theoretical work. When he was finally named leader of the program of the ATM of Skylab, consequentially becoming responsible for continuously increasing roles and functions, and finally was promoted Chief of Solar Physics, he had to come to an end with his experimental work, albeit successfully.\n\nIn 1974, the Nixon administration drafted its Federal Executive Development Program, with the goal to reduce the isolation of the Federal ministries, specifically among the higher level civil servants, the so-called super-grades. As a consequence, management skills gained a higher weight than the academic knowledge of the subject matter. Around 8.000 mid-level civil servants had to apply for 25 positions. Oertel applied successfully and was offered „free choice“ among the Federal ministries. After the introduction course in Charlottesville, South Carolina he became, for six months each, scientific advisor to the President and at the Office of Management and Budget of the President's Office – Department for Space, Science and Energy. In 1975, he was appointed Head of the Astronomy Program at the Ministry of Science, and in 1976 Chief of Staff of the Assistant Administrator for nuclear energy. From 1977 to 1984, he served as director for nuclear energy facilities (including nuclear waste- and secondary products of the defense sector) in the newly created Department of Energy. New positions at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina in Albuquerque brought responsibilities for 32,000 employees and an overall budget of USD 3 billion.\n\nOertel returned to the Ministry of Energy in 1985 as deputy assistant. Dealing with the consequences of the Challenger space shuttle accident and the Chernobyl disaster, the appointment to President and Chief Executive of AURA came at a suitable moment. AURA operated the Hubble Space Telescope, space- and solar observatories in Arizona, New Mexico and Chile, and, more recently, also the Gemini Observatorys in Hawaii and Chile. After thirteen successful years at this position, Oertel finally declined a five-year renewal of his contract.\n\nOertel remains an active member of The National Academy of Sciences, and continues his work for various foundations and universities, as well as for ministries of science in North- and South America. The National Academies elected him as Associate for life. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers honored him with the Dixy Lee Ray Prize. Finally, the International Astronomic Union baptized an asteroid after him: 5074 Goetzoertel.\n\nOertel and his wife have one daughter and one son.

{"id": "2042924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2042924", "title": "Iraj Mirza", "text": "Iraj Mirza\n\nPrince Iraj Mirza (, literally \"Prince Iraj\"; October 1874 – 14 March 1926) (titled Jalāl-ol-Mamālek, ), son of prince Gholam-Hossein Mirza, was a famous Iranian poet. He was a modern poet and his works are associated with the criticism of traditions. He also made translation of literary works from French into Persian.\n\nIraj was born in October 1874 in Tabriz, northwestern Iran. His pedigree chart shows that he was a great-grandson of Fath Ali Shah Qajar, the second shah of Qajar dynasty (reigned 1797–1834). Iraj's father, prince Gholam-Hossein Mirza was son of prince Malek Iraj Mirza son of Fath Ali Shah Qajar.\n\nGholam-Hossein Mirza, Iraj's father, was a poet laureate or the official court-poet of Mozaffar al-Din Mirza. Mozaffar al-Din Mirza, the son of Nasser-al-Din Shah (the fourth shah of Qajar dynasty reigned 1848–1896), was the Crown Prince of Iran at the time. (As a tradition, all Crown Princes during Qajar era used to reside in Tabriz).\n\nThough some sources indicate that Iraj was schooled privately, there are reliable evidences that he studied at a branch of the Dārolfonoon (House of Sciences and Techniques) in Tabriz. At 15, he was fluent in Persian, French, Arabic and Azerbaijani. He was also familiar with the art of calligraphy. His handwriting was very artistic and he was and still is considered as one of the famous calligraphers of Iran.\n\nIn 1890, at the age of 16, Iraj got married. When he was 19, both his father and wife died.\n\nHe then took the position of his late father and became the court-poet of Mozaffar al-Din Mirza . At 22, when Mozaffar al-Din Mirza acceded to the throne in 1896 and became Mozaffar al-Din Shah; Iraj was titled as the Head of Poets (in Persian: Sadr o-Shoʻarā). He was then titled as \"Jalāl ol-Mamālek\".\n\nFew years later, however, he left the royal court and joined the Tabriz office of Ali Khan Amin al-Dowleh who was the governor of Iranian Azarbaijan. At this time, Iraj learned French and became very familiar with Russian too.\n\nIn 1905, when Amino-Dowleh was relocated and moved to Tehran, Iraj also accompanied him and soon became involved in the Persian Constitutional Revolution. In 1907 when Ahmad Ghavam (Qavam os-Saltaneh), a governmental authority, was assigned to go to Europe, Iraj was asked to join him. Two years later, Iraj returned to Tehran where he started to work as a staff member in the \"Office of Official Compositions\" (in Persian: Dār ol-ʻenshā).\n\nIn 1915, his first son, Ja'afar Gholi Mirza, due to some psychological problems, committed suicide.\n\nIn 1917, Iraj joined the newly established Ministry of Culture, and three years later he was transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Revenue. From 1920 to 1925 he worked as a Revenue Officer in Mashhad, the capital city of Khorasan Province (now Razavi Khorasan), in northeast of Iran.\n\nAt 52, Iraj moved back to Tehran where he died on March 14, 1926.\n\nHe was survived by his second son, Khosrow Iraj.\n\nIraj is considered as one of the famous contemporary poets of Iran and also as the first Iranian master of colloquial poetry. In his verses he uses words from everyday speech. The origin of this tendency has come to be identified with his name. Through Iraj, poetic language was enriched with many colloquial words and expressions. His simple poetic language is also famous for its witticism and satire.\n\nDuring Qajar era, Iraj was influenced by the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1906–1911) and by the changing circumstances in the country. This fact is manifested in the particular style of poetry that he created. Modern and imported concepts, combined with what were obtained from his own thoughts, form the framework of his style. He criticizes the social conditions of the country, and the striking originality in his use of metaphor when addressing diverse social problems has been admirable by his critics.\n\nHis style is rich in the art of simile. His striking sarcasm, pungent and fanged words are pointed at the dishonest clergy, businessmen, merchants and statesmen. In addition to those colloquial poems, Iraj also composed elegies to praise Mozzafar-al-Din Shah, Hassan Ali Khan Garroosy (also known as Amir Nezam Garroosy, the governor of Iranian Azarbaijan (now East Azarbaijan and West Azarbaijan) and Kermanshah during Qajar era), and many other Qajar personalities. His praise never shaded into flattery. Iraj also composed very nice massnawi and qat'aa on the raising and education of children, maternal affection, love and romance.\n\nHe was an enlightened and innovative poet, and tended towards European thought.\n\nDespite his famous technical skills, he sometimes used similar cases of rhyme, which is considered by some poetry researchers as an intentional rejection of strict traditional poetical rules. Although Iraj was one of the pioneers of the innovative movement in the Persian poetry, he never thought of abandoning the rules of the classic poetry. Some scholars believe that because of the time in which he lived, his depth of literary knowledge and his familiarity with French and other foreign languages, he could also have been one of the masters of free verse if he wanted to.\n\nHe is particularly famous for his pederastic and satirical poetry.\n\nAmong many poems that Iraj composed, his well-known poems include Satan (in Persian: Ebleess), Mother (in Persian: Maadar), A Letter to a Poet Aref Ghazvini (in Persian: Arefnameh), Woman's Picture (in Persian: Tassvir-e Zan), Story of the Veil or Hijab (in Persian: hejab) and the Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr (in Persian: Daastan-e Zohreh o Manouchehr), which is based on William Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis.\n\nIn Mother, the poet describes a child's affection for his/her mother and how the mother nurtures the child from birth onwards. The words Iraj uses are so exquisitely descriptive and lovely not only in its original Persian but also in translated versions.\n\nThe Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr is one of his famous poetic works. Here Iraj tells the story based on the Greek myth of Venus and Adonis. In this poem, Zohreh leaves the gods and comes to Earth, where she is overcome by the pleasing charm of Manouchehr in his armor. He rejects her advances while Zohreh attempts her first seduction. She goes to great pains to explain the beauty of lovemaking and she finally goes her own way as she returns to the gods.\n\n(Just for the record: On December 8, 2004 the last Iranian movies launched in France was The Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr directed by Mitra Farahani. The film had already participated in Berlin film festival and several other international events and attracted many viewers).\n\nIraj was known to believe that the status of Iranian women at his time was devastatingly reminiscent of the Dark Ages.

Josephus states the traditional belief that this individual was the ancestor of the Greeks.\nAlso serving as the Hebrew name for Greece or Greeks in general, יָוָן \"Yavan\" or \"Yāwān\" has long been considered cognate with the name of the eastern Greeks, the Ionians (Greek Ἴωνες \"Iōnes\", Homeric Greek Ἰάονες \"Iáones\"; Mycenaean Greek *Ιαϝονες \"Iawones\"). The Greek race has been known by cognate names throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Near East and beyond: see Sanskrit \"Yona\" & Sanskrit ( \"yavana\") or proto Aryan languages Sanskrit probably originated. In Greek mythology, the eponymous forefather of the Ionians is similarly called Ion, a son of Apollo. The opinion that Javan is synonymous with Greek Ion and thus fathered the Ionians is common to numerous writers of the early modern period including Sir Walter Raleigh, Samuel Bochart, John Mill and Jonathan Edwards, and is still frequently encountered today.\n\nJavan is also found in apocalyptic literature in the Book of Daniel, 8:21-22 and 11:2, in reference to the King of Greece (יון)—most commonly interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.\n\nWhile Javan is generally associated with the ancient Greeks and Greece (cf. Gen. 10:2, Dan. 8:21, Zech. 9:13, etc.), his sons (as listed in Genesis 10) have usually been associated with locations in the Northeastern Mediterranean Sea and Anatolia: Elishah (modern Cyprus), Tarshish (Tarsus in Cilicia, but after 1646 often identified with Tartessus in Spain), Kittim (modern Cyprus), and Dodanim (alt. 1 Chron. 1:7 'Rodanim,' the island of Rhodes, west of modern Turkey between Cyprus and the mainland of Greece).\n\n"}

He also served within that time as regional party general secretary for Baden-Württemberg.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, his home and offices in Berlin and Karlsruhe were raided by the LKAs of both Berlin and Baden-Württemberg in a search for child pornography which he had allegedly obtained on his mobile phone. Although he claimed that the raid and investigation were politically motivated, he resigned from all government posts on 7 March, and was stripped of his parliamentary immunity on the same day. Prosecutors began the investigation after they had obtained access to phone numbers and addresses found on the mobile phone of a Bremerhaven man who was suspected of participation in a child pornography ring. He stated on 11 March that he had purchased the material only for investigation purposes pertinent to his office. He reports that his research suggests that child pornography is typically distributed by MMS and traditional mail, so that blocking websites is ineffective.\n\nOn 20 June 2009, Tauss announced he was leaving the SPD for the Pirate Party Germany in protest against that party's support of legislation that would block child pornography websites, which he said would set up a technical infrastructure of censorship without judicial review. On 1 July, Tauss appealed against the law because of formal reasons at the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. On 8 September 2009, he was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and the next day he was formally charged. In May 2010 he got a suspended prison sentence of 15 months. The judge concluded that he had been active in the online child pornography scene for private reasons rather than out of political motives relating to his parliamentary work. However, the judge did not think his motivation had necessarily been sexual, it could have been sheer curiosity. 'This is a judgement which I cannot live with and do not want to live with,' Tauss said after the trial. He plans to appeal the verdict.\n\n"}

She is a graduate of Dartmouth College.\n\nLewis is the daughter of a family of teachers. She left Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy) after her junior year to attend Mount Holyoke College.

A widow, her second husband is a former Chicago schools physical education teacher.\n\nLewis is the president of the Chicago Teachers Union. She has been a member of the union since 1988. In 2010, Lewis, running with the Caucus of Rank and File Educators (CORE), gained control over the CTU by winning 60% of the vote in a run-off election. CORE ran an aggressive grassroots organizing campaign, and took a strong stance against school privatization. CORE accused the incumbent United Progressive Caucus (UPC) of capitulating to corporate interests, silencing dissent within the union, and collaborating with the city to prevent union outreach at schools. CORE quickly took action to distinguish itself from UPC, the previous caucus controlling the CTU, reaffirm its grassroots support, and launch a campaign to defend public education. The new leadership cut pay for union officers and used the savings to expand outreach. CORE represented a major bloc of dissent at the 2012 AFT convention, and held signs in protest of Race to the Top during a speech from Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn early September 2012 she led the Chicago Teachers Union on a 10-day strike. Emerging victorious, the union softened the proposed teacher evaluation system, prevented the instituting of merit pay, and ensured protections for veteran teachers in phased out schools.

They are part of a larger grouping of people referred collectively as the Orang Ulu, or upriver people. Like some other Dayak people, they are known for being fierce warriors, former headhunters, adept in Upland rice cultivation, and having extensive tattoos and stretched earlobes amongst both sexes.\n\nThey may have originated from along the Kayan river in the North Kalimantan province of Borneo. They live along the upper Kayan and the middle Kapuas and Mahakam rivers. They seem to have expanded to the south in Sarawak in historic times, generating some conflicts with the Iban that were expanding north at the same time. They have settled in Sarawak on the middle Baram River, the Bintulu River and along the Rajang River, having been pressed back a little during the late 19th century. In 1863 West Kalimantan, Iban people migrated to the upstreams of Saribas River and Rejang River and started to attack the Kayan people in those areas and continued doing so northwards and later eastwards. Wars and headhunting attacks have caused many other tribes to be displaced, including the Kayan people, who make up of 1.4% of the West Kutai Regency population. Significant expansion to the east Borneo also occurred during the historical times, the conversion of the Kayan people to Islam forming the ethnogenesis of the Bulungan people.\n\nThe Kayan language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.\n\nTheir basic culture is similar to the other Dayak people in Borneo. Their agriculture was based upon shifting cultivation techniques and the cultivation of Upland rice. Other farming such as sago, corn, yams, pumpkin and tobacco are also cultivated. During the years of famine, sago is mined. Fishing (killing fish with poisons) plays an important role, and a smaller role is played by hunting with a \"sumpitan\". The Kayan people are engaged in breeding pigs and chickens, while dogs are kept for ritual purposes. The Kayan people are known as excellent blacksmiths (the Kayan Mandau swords are the main item of exchange), boat builders and carpenters. Loom, weaving, production of tans, arts, wood carving, making of masks and pottery are also developed.\n\nTraditionally, they live in long houses on river banks. Their settlement consists of one or several long houses as long as 300 meters, which can accommodate up to 100 families (400–600 people) and consist of a common veranda and rooms. Residents of a long house constitute a tribal community. The Kayan people are divided into three endogamous caste-estate groups; \"house owning group\" or aristocrat (\"ipun uma\" or \"keta'u\"), community members or commoners (\"panyun\") and slaves (\"lupau\"). Among the nobility, marriages are usually outside of the community, often with other tribes; while community members and slaves usually marry within the community. The leader is usually elected from the nobility class (in the 19th century, he also served as a military leader). The settlement is bi-localized, and the filiation is bilateral, while the system of kinship is of the English model.\n\nThe Kayan people a developed mythology and a complex cult (bounty hunting and human sacrifices that disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century, as well as shamanism). The core event was the feast of collected heads (\"mamat\"), during which warrior initiations and funeral ceremonies were held. In the 20th century, the Kayan people began to convert to Christianity.\n\n\n"}

She was also the wife of footballer Magnus Hedman and as a result has been voted the sexiest footballer's wife.\n\nGraaf was born in Gothenburg, but she grew up in Kungsängen in Stockholm County, to Swedish Pentecostal parents.\n\nIn her late teens, Graaf became pregnant with her son Isak. Instead of burdening or embarrassing her religious parents, she married her Finnish gangster boyfriend Jorma whom she was already living with. During this time, she was physically and emotional abused.\n\nAfter Graaf was shot in the leg, she left her husband despite threats against her and her family. She eventually reported him to the proper authorities. As a result, she was placed under protective custody and given new identities. She and her son were moved throughout Sweden but eventually settled in Gothenburg and was given the new names of Michaela and Ville for her son.\n\nHer husband was eventually released from prison and he put a 50 000 SEK bounty on her and a reward for hurting her sister model, Hannah. After her husband's indictment, the police did little to help Graaf. She did receive some help from a policewoman who would eventually get fired for helping Graaf. To this day, Graaf has a bitter disdain for the Swedish authorities. Her plight eventually was heard by former MC gang leader who felt bad for her and decided to protect Graaf. Finally, Graaf had enough of hiding and returned home to her mother. Later her ex-husband decided to stop the harassment.\n\nDue to all the stress following the aftermath her ex-husband's indictment, Graaf lost a great deal of weight and suffered from lack of confidence. She underwent breast augmentation and started an exercise regimen. Her sister Hannah, an established model, took her to a celebrity party where she met E-Type who hit on her. She claims this boosted her confidence and being seen on the party scene with her sister landed her a modeling career.\n\nGraaf followed the footsteps of her younger sister and began glamour modeling. Graaf would often model with her sister Hannah. The two gained noterity for appearing in countless men's magazines. The controversy catapulted lesser known Graaf's career.

The sisters flew to Los Angeles and did a pictorial for \"FHM\" magazine.\n\nThe Graaf sisters became a cultural phenomenon and, by 1998 both sisters gave up glamour modeling to pursue a music career. That same year, she formed a musical duo The Graaf Sisters with Hannah and was quickly signed to Sony BMG. The two worked with producers Christer Sandelin, Tommy Ekman, and Rob 'n' Raz. The record yielded the Swedish #1 hit \"You Got (What I Want)\". The duo has since been on hiatus with both women marrying and having children.\n\nIn 2002, the sisters were involved in a civil suit against Mikael Brinkstierna. Brinkstierna alleged that the sisters began working with him in 1996 and that they had a management contract in which he was entitled to 25% of all revenues from the sisters' future disc sales. After the success of their first album, Brinkstierna received no money after he allegedly spent hours helping them be a success. The sisters claim that Brinkstierna gave them nothing but money and accused him of being a crook after a similar dispute Brinkstierna had with the pop group Aqua.\n\nIn March 2006, Graaf released her biography \"Det ska bli ett sant nöje att döda dig\" (\"It is going to be a true pleasure to kill you\"), where she tells about her childhood and her first, problematic marriage. The title of her book was the last thing her ex-husband Jorma said to her before she left him and fled with their son Isak.\n\nGraaf participated in the Swedish edition of \"Dancing with the Stars\" (\"Let's Dance\") until the end of January 2009, when she was forced to quit due to a cerebral hemorrhage.

The couple had two sons named Lancelot (born in 2000) and Tristan (born in 2004).

After the shooting, Griffin became a fugitive from justice for six years, but after she was profiled on \"America's Most Wanted\", Griffin was captured in El Cajon, California, a suburb of San Diego, in June 2005.\n\nMalaika Tamu Griffin was born on May 11, 1971. She graduated magna cum laude from Jackson State University and received a Bachelor of Science in chemistry. Griffin was known to be a 'loner', and after her graduation from JSU, she went on a solo backpacking journey in Europe. In 1999, she moved to Denver, Colorado, where she was working in a pharmacy and was renting a room in a house next door to a white couple: Jason Patrick Horsley and his girlfriend Deborah Loiselle. Jason Horsley was a carpenter, and Griffin became angry when Horsley laid his tools on the sidewalk in front of her house after work. A bitter argument ensued on May 18, 1999.\n\nAfter arguing with Jason Horsley on May 18, 1999, Griffin returned to her apartment and came out with a 9 mm handgun with a laser sight and shot Horsley point blank in the back, killing him instantly. Immediately after the incident, Griffin fled to the nearby home of an acquaintance, Monique Thomas. Griffin stole Thomas' car at gunpoint and then drove away. The car was later found abandoned in Iowa City, Iowa. \n\nInside Malaika Griffin's apartment, police found a 9 mm carbine, ammunition, hand grenades and the library of a terrorist, with books about terrorism and bomb making including \"The Anarchist Cookbook\", \"Home Workshop Silencers\" and \"The Poor Man's James Bond\". In addition, Griffin's diary was also discovered. In it, Griffin expresses her deep hatred for white people.\n\nGriffin had last been seen boarding a bus to Chicago, Illinois. After that, there had been no sighting of her for years. On May 22, 2004, more than five years after the murder, Griffin was profiled again on \"America's Most Wanted\", and then again a year later on June 4, 2005. After the second showing, authorities received a tip from Griffin's co-workers. The FBI and the El Cajon Police Department contacted the suspect, who had been going by the name \"Lake Griffin.\" After the FBI confronted her, Griffin admitted her identity. She had been working at a biotech firm as a lab assistant, at a fast-food restaurant and thrift store. Griffin was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated robbery, and aggravated motor vehicle theft. She waived her extradition and was returned to Colorado to stand trial.\n\nGriffin's trial began on February 27, 2006. Prosecutors also entered into evidence the weapons found in Griffin's apartment after she fled. Griffin decided to testify in her own defense at the trial. She claimed to be innocent of the offenses, and said her diary was about a play she was writing. After a one-week-long trial and seven hours of jury deliberations, Malaika Griffin was convicted on all counts. Under Colorado law, a first-degree murder conviction results in an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.\n\nGriffin's case was profiled on the Oxygen Network program \"Snapped\" on February 3, 2008 and on Investigation Discovery's \"Deadly Women\" on October 12, 2012.\n\nGriffin filed an appeal in April 2009 to the Colorado Court of Appeals. She argued that her convictions should be overturned because her trial attorney was not licensed to practice law in Colorado, her notebook entries, self-defense instructions, and prosecutorial misconduct. All of her claims were denied, and her convictions were all affirmed on April 16, 2009.\n"}

His autobiography has been published as a book, \"The Terminal Man\", in 2004. His story was the inspiration for the 2004 Steven Spielberg film \"The Terminal\".\n\nNasseri was born in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company settlement located in Masjed Soleiman, Iran. His father was an Iranian doctor working for the company. Nasseri stated that his mother was a nurse from Scotland working in the same place. He arrived in the United Kingdom in September 1973, to take a three-year course in Yugoslav studies at the University of Bradford.\n\nNasseri claims he was expelled from Iran in 1977 for protests against the Shah and after a long battle, involving applications in several countries, was awarded refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Belgium<nowiki>. This allegedly permitted residence in many other European countries. However, this claim has been disputed, with investigations showing that Nasseri was never expelled from Iran.</nowiki>\n\nHaving claimed to have one British parent, although he has produced no evidence to support this claim, he decided to settle in the UK in 1986, but en route there in 1988, his papers were lost when his briefcase was allegedly stolen (others indicate that Nasseri actually mailed his documents to Brussels while onboard a ferry to Britain, lying about them being stolen). Despite this setback, he boarded the plane for London but was promptly returned to France when he failed to present a passport to British immigration officials. He was initially arrested by the French, but then released as his entry to the airport was legal and he had no country of origin to be returned to; thus began his residency at Terminal 1.\n\nHis case was later taken on by French human rights lawyer Christian Bourget. In 1992, a French court ruled that, having entered the country legally, he could not be expelled from the airport, but it could not grant him permission to enter France.\n\nAttempts were then made to have new documents issued from Belgium, but the authorities there would only do so if Nasseri presented himself in person. However, under Belgian law a refugee who voluntarily leaves a country that has accepted him cannot return. In 1995, the Belgian authorities granted permission for him to return, but only if he agreed to live there under supervision of a social worker. Nasseri refused this on the grounds of wanting to enter the UK as originally intended.\n\nBoth France and Belgium offered Nasseri residency, but Nasseri refused to sign the papers as they listed him as being Iranian (he wanted it to be British) and did not show his preferred name, \"Sir, Alfred Mehran\". His refusal to sign the documents that would give him his freedom was much to the frustration of his lawyer, Bourget. When contacted about Nasseri's situation, his family stated that they believed he was living the life he wanted.\n\nIn 2003 Spielberg's DreamWorks production company paid US$250,000 to Nasseri for the rights to his story, but ultimately did not use his story in the subsequent film, \"The Terminal\".\n\nNasseri's stay at the airport ended in July 2006 when he was hospitalized and his sitting place dismantled. Towards the end of January 2007 he left the hospital and was looked after by the airport's branch of the French Red Cross; he was lodged for a few weeks in a hotel close to the airport. On 6 March 2007 he transferred to an Emmaus charity reception-centre in Paris's 20th arrondissement. Since 2008 he has continued to live in a Paris shelter.\n\nDuring his 18-year-long stay at Terminal 1 in the Charles de Gaulle Airport, Nasseri had his luggage at his side and spent his time reading, writing in his diary or studying economics. He received food and newspapers from employees of the airport, visits from journalists eager to hear his story and letters of support.\n\nIn 2004 Nasseri's autobiography, \"The Terminal Man\", was published. It was co-written by Nasseri with British author Andrew Donkin and was reviewed in \" The Sunday Times\" as being \"profoundly disturbing and brilliant\".\n\nNasseri's story provided the inspiration for the 1994 French film \"Tombés du ciel\", starring Jean Rochefort, internationally released under the title \"Lost in Transit\". The short story \"The Fifteen-Year Layover\", written by Michael Paterniti and published in \"GQ\" and \"The Best American Non-Required Reading\", chronicles Nasseri's life. Alexis Kouros made a documentary about him, \"Waiting for Godot at De Gaulle\" (2000). Glen Luchford and Paul Berczeller made the \"Here to Where\" mockumentary (2001), also featuring Nasseri. Hamid Rahmanian and Melissa Hibbard made a documentary called \"Sir Alfred of Charles De Gaulle Airport\" (2001).\n\nNasseri was reportedly the inspiration behind the character Viktor Navorski, from the 2004 Steven Spielberg film \"The Terminal\"; however, neither publicity materials, nor the DVD \"special features\" nor the film's website mentions Nasseri's situation as an inspiration for the film. Despite this, in September 2003, \"The New York Times\" noted that Steven Spielberg had bought the rights to his life story as the basis for \"The Terminal\". \"The Guardian\" indicates that Spielberg's DreamWorks production company paid US$250,000 to Nasseri for rights to his story and report that, as of 2004, he carried a poster advertising Spielberg's film draping his suitcase next to his bench. Nasseri was reportedly excited about \"The Terminal\", but it was unlikely that he would ever have had a chance to see it in cinemas.\n\nNasseri's story was also the inspiration for the contemporary opera \"Flight\" by British composer Jonathan Dove, which won the Helpmann Award at the Adelaide Festival Theatre in March 2006.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1560672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1560672", "title": "Prince William, Duke of Gloucester", "text": "Prince William, Duke of Gloucester\n\nPrince William, Duke of Gloucester (24 July 1689 – 30 July 1700) was the son of Princess Anne, later Queen of England, Ireland and Scotland from 1702, and her husband, Prince George of Denmark. He was their only child to survive infancy. Styled Duke of Gloucester, he was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the \"Glorious Revolution\" that had deposed his Catholic grandfather James II the previous year.\n\nGloucester's mother was estranged from her brother-in-law and cousin, William III, and her sister, Mary II, but supported links between them and her son. He grew close to his uncle William, who created him a Knight of the Garter, and his aunt Mary, who frequently sent him presents. At his nursery in Campden House, Kensington, he befriended his Welsh body-servant, Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of the Duke is an important source for historians, and operated his own miniature army, called the \"Horse Guards\", which eventually comprised 90 boys.\n\nGloucester's precarious health was a constant source of worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of 11, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. The English Parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.\n\nIn late 1688, in what became known as the \"Glorious Revolution\", the Roman Catholic King James of England, Scotland and Ireland was deposed by his Protestant nephew and son-in-law, Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William and his wife, James's elder daughter Mary, were recognised by the English and Scottish parliaments as king and queen. As they had no children, Mary's younger sister, Anne, was designated their heir presumptive in England and Scotland. The accession of William and Mary and the succession through Anne were enshrined in the Bill of Rights 1689.\n\nAnne was married to Prince George of Denmark, and in their six years of marriage Anne had been pregnant six times, but none of her children had survived. Her seventh pregnancy resulted in the birth of a son at 5 a.m. on 24 July 1689 in Hampton Court Palace. As it was usual for the births of potential heirs to the throne to be attended by several witnesses, the King and Queen and \"most of the persons of quality about the court\" were present. Three days later, the newborn baby was baptised William Henry after his uncle King William by Henry Compton, Bishop of London. The King, who was one of the godparents along with the Marchioness of Halifax and the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Dorset, declared him Duke of Gloucester, although the peerage was never formally created. Gloucester was second in line to the throne after his mother, and because his birth secured the Protestant succession, he was the hope of the revolution's supporters. The ode \"The Noise of Foreign Wars\", attributed to Henry Purcell, was written in celebration of the birth. Other congratulatory odes, such as Purcell's last royal ode \"Who Can From Joy Refrain?\" and John Blow's \"The Duke of Gloucester's March\" and \"A Song upon the Duke of Gloucester\", were composed for his birthdays in later years. Opponents of the revolution, supporters of James known as the Jacobites, spoke of Gloucester as \"a sickly and doomed usurper\".\n\nThough described as a \"brave livlylike boy\", Gloucester became ill with convulsions when he was three weeks old, so his mother moved him into Craven House, Kensington, hoping that the air from the surrounding gravel pits would have a beneficial effect on his health. His convulsions were possibly symptomatic of meningitis, likely contracted at birth and which resulted in hydrocephalus. As was usual among royalty, Gloucester was placed in the care of a governess, Lady Fitzhardinge, and was suckled by a wet nurse, Mrs. Pack, rather than his mother. As part of his treatment, Gloucester was driven outside every day in a small open carriage, pulled by Shetland ponies, to maximise his exposure to the air of the gravel pits. When the effectiveness of this treatment exceeded their expectations, Princess Anne and her husband acquired a permanent residence in the area, Campden House, a Jacobean mansion, in 1690. It was here that Gloucester befriended Welsh body-servant Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of his master is an important source for historians.\n\nThroughout his life, Gloucester suffered from a recurrent \"ague\", which was treated with regular doses of Jesuit's bark (an early form of quinine) by his physician, John Radcliffe. Gloucester disliked the treatment intensely, and usually vomited after being given it. Possibly as a result of hydrocephalus, he had an enlarged head, which his surgeons pierced intermittently to draw off fluid. He could not walk properly, and was apt to stumble. Nearing the age of five, Gloucester refused to climb stairs without two attendants to hold him, which Lewis blamed on indulgent nurses who over-protected the boy. His father birched him until he agreed to walk by himself. Corporal punishment was usual at the time, and such treatment would not have been considered harsh.\n\nGloucester's language acquisition was delayed: he did not speak correctly until the age of three, and consequently the commencement of his education was postponed by a year. The Reverend Samuel Pratt, a Cambridge graduate, was appointed the Duke's tutor in 1693. Lessons concentrated on geography, mathematics, Latin, and French. Pratt was an enemy of Jenkin Lewis, and they frequently disagreed over how Gloucester should be educated. Lewis remained Gloucester's favourite attendant because, unlike Pratt, he was knowledgeable in military matters and could therefore help him with his \"Horse Guards\", a miniature army consisting of local children. Over a couple of years from 1693, the size of the army grew from 22 to over 90 boys.\n\nPrincess Anne had fallen out with her sister and brother-in-law, William and Mary, and reluctantly agreed to the advice of her friend, the Countess of Marlborough, that Gloucester should visit his aunt and uncle regularly to ensure their continued goodwill towards him. In an attempt to heal the rift, Anne invited the King and Queen to see Gloucester drill the \"Horse Guards\". After watching the boys' display at Kensington Palace, the King praised them, and made a return visit to Campden House the following day. Gloucester grew closer to his aunt and uncle: the Queen bought him presents from his favourite toy shop regularly. Her death in 1694 led to a superficial reconciliation between Anne and William, which occasioned a move to St James's Palace, London. Gloucester having tired of him, Lewis only attended St James's every two months.\n\nOn his seventh birthday, Gloucester attended a ceremony at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, to install him as a knight of the Order of the Garter, an honour the King had given him six months before. Gloucester became ill during the celebratory banquet afterwards and left early, but after his recovery went deer hunting in Windsor Great Park, where he was blooded by Samuel Masham, his father's page. Princess Anne wrote to the Countess of Marlborough, \"My boy continues yet very well, and looks better, I think, than ever he did in his life; I mean more healthy, for though I love him very well, I can't brag of his beauty.\"\nDuring the trial of Sir John Fenwick, who was implicated in a plot to assassinate King William, Gloucester signed a letter to the King promising his loyalty. \"I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject,\" the letter read, \"had rather lose my life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, and I hope it will not be long ere you conquer France.\" Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: \"We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood.\"\n\nIn 1697, Parliament granted King William £50,000 to establish a household for the Duke of Gloucester, though the King only permitted the release of £15,000, keeping the difference for himself. The establishment of Gloucester's own household in early 1698 revived the feud between Anne and William. William was determined to limit Anne's involvement in the household, and therefore appointed, against her wishes, the low church Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, as Gloucester's preceptor. Anne was high church, and Burnet, knowing she was unhappy, attempted to decline the appointment, but the King insisted he accept it. Anne's anger was only placated by an assurance from King William that she could choose all the lower servants of the household. The Earl of Marlborough, a friend of Anne's, was appointed Gloucester's governor, after the Duke of Shrewsbury declined the office on the grounds of ill health. Shortly before the King sailed for the Netherlands, he received Anne's choices from Marlborough but he refused to confirm them. His favourite, the Earl of Albemarle, eventually convinced him to agree to Anne's appointments, and the King's acceptance was sent from the Netherlands in September 1698. The Marlboroughs' twelve-year-old son, Lord Churchill, was appointed Gloucester's Master of the Horse, and became a friend and playmate. Abigail Hill, a kinswoman of the Countess of Marlborough, was appointed his laundress, and Abigail's brother, Jack Hill, was made one of Gloucester's gentlemen of the bedchamber.\nBurnet lectured Gloucester for hours at a time on subjects such as the feudal constitutions of Europe and law before the time of Christianity. Burnet also encouraged Gloucester to memorise facts and dates by heart. Government ministers inspected Gloucester's academic progress every four months, finding themselves \"amazed\" by his \"wonderful memory and good judgement\". His childhood troop was disbanded, and King William made him the honorary commander of a real regiment of Dutch footguards. In 1699, he attended the trials in the House of Lords of Lord Mohun and Lord Warwick, who were accused of murder. Mohun was acquitted; Warwick was found guilty of manslaughter but escaped punishment by pleading privilege of peerage.\n\nAs he neared his eleventh birthday, Gloucester was assigned the rooms in Kensington Palace that had been used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, he was suffering from a sore throat and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately bled, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.\n\nThe physicians could not agree on a diagnosis. Radcliffe thought he had scarlet fever, while others thought it was smallpox. They administered \"cordial powders and cordial juleps\". Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, \"you have destroyed him and you may finish him\". He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective. In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July \"in great sighings and dejections of spirits ... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters.\" Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted. However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester was breathing more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was \"taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense\". Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents beside him. In the end, the physicians decided the cause of death was \"a malignant fever\". An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the ventricles of his brain: \"four and a half ounces of a limpid humour were taken out.\" A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute bacterial pharyngitis, with associated pneumonia. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.\n\nKing William, who was in the Netherlands, wrote to Marlborough, \"It is so great a loss to me as well as to all England, that it pierces my heart.\" Anne was prostrate with grief, taking to her chamber. In the evenings, she was carried into the garden \"to divert her melancholy thoughts\". Gloucester's body was moved from Windsor to Westminster on the night of 1 August, and he lay in state in the Palace of Westminster before being entombed in the Royal Vault of the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey on 9 August. As was usual for royalty in mourning, his parents did not attend the funeral service, instead remaining in seclusion at Windsor.\n\nIn an allusion to Prince William's death, Tory politician William Shippen wrote:\n\nGloucester's death destabilised the succession, as his mother was the only person remaining in the Protestant line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.\n\nWilliam was styled as: His Royal Highness Prince William, Duke of Gloucester.\n\n\nGloucester bore the royal arms, differenced by an inescutcheon of the Danish coat of arms and a label of three points Argent, the centre point bearing a cross Gules.\n\n"}

{"id": "228637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228637", "title": "Rudolf Christoph Eucken", "text": "Rudolf Christoph Eucken\n\nRudolf Christoph Eucken (; 5 January 1846 – 15 September 1926) was a German philosopher. He received the 1908 Nobel Prize for Literature \"in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life\", after he had been nominated by a member of the Swedish Academy.\n\nEucken was born on 5 January 1846 in Aurich, then in the Kingdom of Hanover (now Lower Saxony). His father, Ammo Becker Eucken (1792–1851) died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his mother, Ida Maria (1814–1872, née Gittermann). He was educated at Aurich, where one of his teachers was the classical philologist and philosopher Ludwig Wilhelm Maximilian Reuter (1803–1881). He studied at Göttingen University (1863–66), where Hermann Lotze was one of his teachers, and Berlin University. In the latter place, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg was a professor whose ethical tendencies and historical treatment of philosophy greatly attracted him.\n\nEucken received his Ph.D. in classical philology and ancient history at Göttingen University in 1866 with a dissertation under the title \"De Aristotelis dicendi ratione\". However, the inclination of his mind was definitely towards the philosophical side of theology. In 1871, after five years working as a school teacher at Husum, Berlin und Frankfurt, he was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Basel, Switzerland, succeeding another of his former teachers at Göttingen, Gustav Teichmüller. He stayed there until 1874 when he took up a similar position at the University of Jena. He stayed there until he retired in 1920. In 1912-13, Eucken spent half of the year as an exchange professor at Harvard University, and in 1913 he served as a Deem lecturer at New York University. During World War I, Eucken, like many of his academic colleagues, took a strong line in favour of the causes with which his country had associated itself.\n\nEucken's philosophical work is partly historical and partly constructive, the former side being predominant in his earlier, the latter in his later works. Their most striking feature is the close organic relationship between the two parts. The aim of the historical works is to show the necessary connexion between philosophical concepts and the age to which they belong; the same idea is at the root of his constructive speculation. All philosophy is philosophy of life, the development of a new culture, not mere intellectualism, but the application of a vital religious inspiration to the practical problems of society. This practical idealism Eucken described by the term \"ethical activism.\" In accordance with this principle, Eucken gave considerable attention to social and educational problems.\n\nHe maintained that humans have souls, and that they are therefore at the junction between nature and spirit. He believed that people should overcome their non-spiritual nature by continuous efforts to achieve a spiritual life, another aspect of his ethical activism and meaning of life.\n\nHe married Irene Passow (1863–1941) in 1882 and had a daughter and two sons. His son Walter Eucken became a famous founder of ordoliberal thought in economics. His son Arnold Eucken was a chemist/physicist.\n\nRudolf Eucken died on 15 September 1926 in Jena at the age of 80.\n\nHe was a prolific writer; his best-known works are:\n\nOther notable works are:\n\nOther English translations of his work include:\n\nHe delivered lectures in England in 1911 and spent six months lecturing at Harvard University and elsewhere in the United States in 1912–1913.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "60024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60024", "title": "Sam Houston", "text": "Sam Houston\n\nSam Houston (March 2, 1793July 26, 1863) was an American soldier and politician. An important leader of the Texas Revolution, Houston served as the 1st and 3rd president of the Republic of Texas, and was one of the first two individuals to represent Texas in the United States Senate. He also served as the 6th Governor of Tennessee and the 7th governor of Texas.\n\nBorn in Rockbridge County, Virginia, Houston and his family migrated to Maryville, Tennessee when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the Cherokee, becoming known as \"Raven\". He served under General Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812, and after the war he presided over the removal of many Cherokee from Tennessee. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827 Houston won election as the Governor of Tennessee. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, joined his Cherokee friends in Arkansas Territory, and began a relationship with a Native American woman.\n\nHouston settled in Texas in 1832. After the Battle of Gonzales, Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the Texian Army. He led the Texian Army to victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won election in the 1836 Texas presidential election. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won election to another term in the 1841 Texas presidential election. Houston played a key role in the annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845, and in 1846 he was elected to represent Texas in the United States Senate. He joined the Democratic Party and supported President James K. Polk's prosecution of the Mexican–American War.\n\nHouston's Senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the Compromise of 1850, which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican–American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the Kansas-Nebraska Act because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the American Party in the 1856 presidential election and the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 presidential election. In 1859, Houston won election as the Governor of Texas. In that role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the Confederate States of America. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the namesake of the city of Houston, the fourth most populous city in the United States.\n\nHouston was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia on March 2, 1793, to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from British and Irish immigrants who had settled in British North America in the 1730s. Houston's father was descended from Ulster Scots people; he could trace his ancestry to Sir Hugh de Paduinan, a Norman knight. By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and a handful of slaves, and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.\n\nHouston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the \"lost\" State of Franklin then in the western frontier of North Carolina, who advocated for the passage of his proposed \"A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland\" at the convention that was assembled in Greeneville on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.\n\nHouston had five brothers and three sisters, as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life. Houston did take an interest in his father's library, however, reading works by classical authors like Virgil, as well as more recent works by authors such as Jedidiah Morse.\n\nHouston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service. He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near Maryville, the seat of Blount County, Tennessee. At that time, Tennessee was on the American frontier, and even larger towns like Nashville were vigilant against Native American raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of sixteen he left his family to live with a Cherokee tribe led by Ahuludegi (also spelled Oolooteka). Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as \"Raven\". He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.\n\nIn 1813, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which was then engaged in the War of 1812 against Britain and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the 39th Infantry Regiment, Thomas Hart Benton, and by the end of 1813 Houston had risen to the rank of third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded General Andrew Jackson, who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the Muscogee (or \"Creek\") tribe in the Old Southwest. Houston was badly wounded in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, the decisive battle in the Creek War. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman John Rhea.\n\nIn early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the removal of Cherokee from East Tennessee. In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from Secretary of War John C. Calhoun after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that would last until Calhoun's death in 1850. Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818 he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in Arkansas Territory.\n\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor Joseph McMinn, Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia. Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812. Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the 1820 United States Census, and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district. In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the 1824 presidential election, which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a contingent election, which was won by John Quincy Adams. Supporters of Jackson would eventually coalesce into the Democratic Party, while those who favored Adams would become known as National Republicans. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as Governor of Tennessee in 1827. Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on public domain. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the 1828 presidential election.\n\nIn January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart, possibly because Eliza loved another man. In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as Governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.\n\nHouston was reunited with Ahuludegi's group of Cherokee in mid-1829. Because of Houston's experience in government and his connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration. In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues. In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston made an unsuccessful bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey. When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman William Stanbery alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane. After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House Andrew Stevenson formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages.\n\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends, William H. Wharton and John Austin Wharton, wrote to convince him to travel to the Mexican possession of Texas, where unrest among the American settlers was growing. The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter he was granted land in Texas. Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches at the Convention of 1833, which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew up a proposed state constitution. After the convention, Texan leader Stephen F. Austin petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President Valentín Gómez Farías. In 1834, Antonio López de Santa Anna assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin. In October 1835, the Texas Revolution broke out with the Battle of Gonzales, a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the Consultation, a congregation of Texas leaders.\n\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the Texian Army, though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army. Houston helped organize the Convention of 1836, where the Republic of Texas declared independence from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from William B. Travis, who commanded Texan forces under siege by Santa Anna at the Alamo. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans but also caused desertions in Houston's ranks. Commanding a force of about 350 men that was numerically inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.\n\nThough the provisional government, as well as many of his own subordinates, urged him to attack the Mexican army, Houston continued the retreat east, informing his soldiers that they constituted \"the only army in Texas now present ... There are but a few of us, and if we are beaten, the fate of Texas is sealed.\" Santa Anna divided his forces and finally caught up to Houston in mid-April 1837. Santa Anna's force of about 1350 soldiers trapped Houston's force of 783 men in a marsh; rather than pressing the attack, Santa Anna ordered his soldiers to make camp. On the April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the Battle of San Jacinto. The Texans quickly routed Santa Anna's force, though Houston's ankle was shattered by a stray bullet. In the aftermath of the Battle of San Jacinto, a detachment of Texans captured Santa Anna. Santa Anna was forced to sign the Treaty of Velasco, granting Texas its independence. Houston stayed on briefly for negotiations, then returned to the United States for treatment of his ankle wound.\n\nVictory in the Battle of San Jacinto made Houston a hero to many Texans, and he won the 1836 Texas presidential election, defeating Stephen F. Austin and former governor Henry Smith. Houston took office on October 22, 1836, after interim president David G. Burnet resigned. During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States. Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country's finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico. He selected Thomas Jefferson Rusk as secretary of war, Smith as secretary of the treasury, Samuel Rhoads Fisher as secretary of the navy, James Collinsworth as attorney general, and Austin as secretary of state. Houston sought normalized relations with Mexico and, despite some resistance from the legislature, arranged the release of Santa Anna. Concerned about upsetting the balance between slave states and free states, U.S. President Andrew Jackson refused to push for the annexation of Texas, but in his last official act in office he granted Texas diplomatic recognition. With the United States unwilling to annex Texas, Houston began courting British support; as part of this effort, he urged the end of the importation of slaves into Texas.\n\nIn early 1837, the government moved to a new capital, Houston, named for the country's first president. In 1838, Houston frequently clashed with Congress over issues such as a treaty with the Cherokee and a land-office act. The Texas constitution barred presidents from seeking a second term, so Houston did not stand for re-election in the 1838 election and left office in late 1838. He was succeeded by Mirabeau B. Lamar, who, along with Burnet, led a faction of Texas politicians opposed to Houston. The Lamar administration removed many of Houston's appointees, launched a , and established a new capital, Austin. Meanwhile, Houston opened a legal practice and co-founded a land company with the intent of developing the town of Sabine City. In 1839, he was elected to represent San Augustine County in the Texas House of Representatives.\n\nHouston defeated Burnet in the 1841 Texas presidential election, winning a large majority of the vote. Houston appointed Anson Jones as secretary of state, Asa Brigham as secretary of the treasury, George Washington Hockley as secretary of war, and George Whitfield Terrell as attorney general. The republic faced a difficult financial situation; at one point, Houston commandeered an American brig used to transport Texas soldiers because the government could not afford to pay the brig's captain. The Santa Fe Expedition and other initiatives pursued by Lamar had stirred up tensions with Mexico, and rumors frequently raised fears that Santa Anna would launch an invasion of Texas. Houston continued to curry favor with Britain and France, partly in the hope that British and French influence in Texas would encourage the United States to annex Texas. The Tyler administration made the annexation of Texas its chief foreign policy priority, and in April 1844 Texas and the United States signed an annexation treaty. Annexation did not have sufficient support in Congress, and the United States Senate rejected the treaty in June.\n\nHenry Clay and Martin Van Buren, the respective front-runners for the Whig and Democratic nominations in the 1844 presidential election, both opposed the annexation of Texas. However, Van Buren's opposition to annexation damaged his candidacy, and he was defeated by James K. Polk, an acolyte of Jackson and an old friend of Houston's, at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. Polk went on to defeat Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an electoral mandate. Meanwhile, Houston's term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by his secretary of state, Anson Jones. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk's victory to convince Congress to approve of the annexation of Texas. Seeking Texas's immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would also be required to keep its public debt. A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas became a U.S. state in February 1846.\n\nIn February 1846, shortly before Texas became a state, the Texas legislature elected Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk as Texas's two inaugural U.S. senators. Houston chose to align with the Democratic Party, which contained many of his old political allies, including President Polk. As a former President of Texas, Houston is the most recent former foreign head of state to serve in the U.S. Congress. He is the only individual to serve as the governor of a state and then be elected to the U.S. Senate by another state, though William W. Bibb had previously accomplished the same feat in reverse order. In 2018, Mitt Romney became the second individual to serve as governor of one state and then win election to represent another state in the Senate.\n\nBreaking with the Senate tradition that held that freshman senators were not to address the Senate, in early 1846 Houston strongly advocated for the annexation of Oregon Country. In the Oregon Treaty, which was reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country. Meanwhile, Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead a U.S. army to the Rio Grande River, which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the Nueces River constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the Mexican–American War broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847. After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, acquired the Mexican Cession. Mexico also agreed to recognize the Rio Grande River as the border between Mexico and Texas.\n\nAfter the war, disputes over the extension of slavery into the territories raised sectional tensions. Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the Oregon Bill of 1848, which organized Oregon Territory as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated, \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\" He criticized both Northern abolitionists and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union. He supported the Compromise of 1850, a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent fugitive slave law was passed, and Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt. Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the 1852 presidential election, but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state. The 1852 Democratic National Convention ultimately nominated a compromise nominee, Franklin Pierce, who went on to win the election.\n\nIn 1854, Senator Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which organized Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory. The act also repealed the Missouri Compromise, an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36°30′ north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery. Houston's opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party. In 1855, Houston began to be publicly associated with the American Party, the political wing of the nativist and unionist Know Nothing movement. The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery Republican Party had both emerged as major political movements. Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the naturalization period for immigrants to twenty-one years. He was also attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state, as well the party's unionist stance.\n\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention, but the party nominated former President Millard Fillmore. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas–Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat James Buchanan won the 1856 presidential election. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his Senate tenure. In the 1857 Texas gubernatorial election, Texas Democrats nominated Hardin Richard Runnels, who supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act and attacked Houston's record. In response, Houston announced his own candidacy for governor, but Runnels defeated him by a decisive margin. After the gubernatorial election, the Texas legislature denied Houston re-election in the Senate; Houston rejected calls to resign immediately and served until the end of his term in early 1859.\n\nHouston ran against Runnels in the 1859 gubernatorial election. Capitalizing on Runnels's unpopularity over state issues such as Native American raids, Houston won the election and took office in December 1859. In the 1860 presidential election, Houston and John Bell were the two major contenders for the presidential nomination of the newly-formed Constitutional Union Party, which consisted largely of Southern unionists. Houston narrowly trailed Bell on the first ballot of the 1860 Constitutional Union Convention, but Bell clinched the nomination on the second ballot. Nonetheless, some of Houston's Texan supporters nominated him for president in April 1860. Other backers attempted to launch a nationwide campaign, but in August 1860 Houston announced that he would not be a candidate for president. He refused to endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates. In late 1860, Houston campaigned across his home state, calling on Texans to resist those who advocated for secession if Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election.\n\nAfter Lincoln won the November 1860 presidential election, several Southern states seceded from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America. A Texas convention voted to secede from the United States on February 1, 1861, and Houston proclaimed that Texas was once again an independent republic, but he refused to recognize that same convention's authority to join Texas to the Confederacy. After Houston refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy, the legislature declared the governorship vacant. Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but nor did he attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal. His successor, Edward Clark, was sworn in on March 18. In an undelivered speech, Houston wrote:\n\nOn April 19, 1861, he told a crowd:\n\nAfter leaving office, Houston returned to his home in Galveston. He later settled in Huntsville, Texas, where he lived in a structure known as the Steamboat House. In the midst of the Civil War, Houston was shunned by many Texas leaders, though he continued to correspond with Confederate officer Ashbel Smith and Texas governor Francis Lubbock. His son, Sam Houston, Jr., served in the Confederate army during the Civil War, but returned home after being wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Houston's health suffered a precipitous decline in April 1863, and he died on July 26, 1863.\n\nThe inscription on Houston's tomb reads:\n<poem>\nA Brave Soldier. A Fearless Statesman.\nA Great Orator—A Pure Patriot.\nA Faithful Friend, A Loyal Citizen.\nA Devoted Husband and Father.\nA Consistent Christian—An Honest Man.\n</poem>\n\nHouston married Tiana Rogers (d. 1838), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740–1833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764–1806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a ceremony according to Cherokee customs. Tiana was in her mid-30s, of mixed-race, and a widow. She had two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston lived together for several years, though, under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Tiana later remarried. She died in 1838 of pneumonia.\n\nOn May 9, 1840, Houston, aged 47, married for a third time. His bride was 21-year-old Margaret Moffette Lea of Marion, Alabama, the daughter of planters. They had eight children. Margaret acted as a tempering influence on her much older husband and convinced him to stop drinking. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840–1863) on Trinity Bay.\n\nIn 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas. The sacrament was held in the living room of the Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches. By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the Baptist church. With the assistance of George Washington Baines, she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to Independence, Texas to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. Rufus C. Burleson by immersion in Little Rocky Creek, two miles southeast of Independence.\n\nHouston, the largest city in Texas, is named for Sam Houston. Several other things and places are also named for Houston, including Sam Houston State University, Houston County, Minnesota, Houston County, Tennessee, and Houston County, Texas. Other monuments and memorials include Sam Houston National Forest, Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center, Fort Sam Houston, the USS \"Sam Houston\" (SSBN-609), and a sculpture of Houston in the city of Houston's Hermann Park. Along with Stephen F. Austin, Houston is one of two Texans with a statue in the National Statuary Hall. Houston has been portrayed in works such as \"Man of Conquest\", \"Gone to Texas\", \"Texas Rising\", and \"The Alamo\".\n\n"}

However, the exact site of the battle remains uncertain. Ngqika’s father, Mlawu, died when Ngqika was too young to rule and therefore his uncle Ndlambe, as per custom, became the regent. Under Ndlambe’s leadership, the chieftaincy grew in strength as he consolidated his power by absorbing smaller chiefdoms or expelling them to far afield lands. It was in 1795 when Ngqika had entered manhood that he soon demanded his rightful place as regent and leader of the AmaRharhabe. Ndlambe refused to relinquish power and because of this stalemate, a minor civil battle ensued. The two adversaries co-existed for almost two decades, in a state of immense tensions. \nThe battle of Amalinde, which lasted from midday to nightfall was a result of this longstanding rivalry between the two chiefs, stemming from both personal and socio-political conflict. On the personal, Ngqika fell deeply in love with Thuthula, the beautiful daughter of Dibi and wife of his uncle, Ndlambe. This is incestuous event was a remote but direct cause of the Battle of Amalinde. A more substantial cause of the battle was in 1817 when Ngqika met with Lord Charles Somerset, Governor of the Cape, and was forced to give up both the Great Fish River and Keiskamma River.. The Amaxhosa felt aggrieved, that since Ngqika was not the paramount chief, he could not then authorise the alienation of the land. Ndlambe used this resentment of Ngqika by the people to exploit for his own selfish gains. \n\nMost sources reveal that Ngqika and his men went forth towards the Debe, known in isiXhosa as \"indebe\" meaning pockmark. He followed a route that skirted the foothills of the Amathole region, the route that is today followed by the roads and railway. Having travelled for over 45 kilometres that morning, Ngqika and his men arrived only at noon. It is said that Ngqika watched the battle from the hillside, some believing that possibly even on the foothills of the Ntaba kaNdoda area that flanks the Debe River valley to the north . Sources report that Ngqika himself was neither a great fighter nor military strategist. As such, he appointed his eldest son Maqoma, who had no actual battle experience, together with Jingqi, a renowned fighter, as lead forces in the battle against Ndlambe. In October 1818, Ngqika mobilised his warriors and sent for help from the British Cape Colony. Ngqika and his men sought advice from Ntsikana, the royal diviner and spiritual counsellor, in his quest to destroy the Ndlambe Great Place. Ntsikana first offered his visionary services to Ndlambe, who then rejected them since he was already served by Nxele, prompting Ntsikana to find his spiritual home under the trusteeship of Ngqika. As with the other charismatic millenarian prophet Nxele, who was in service to Ndlambe, Ntsikana came under the influence of the missioner, Johannes van der Kemp, stationed at Bethelsdorp near Port Elizabeth.\n\nNdlambe had the advantage of distance and did, in fact, use it wisely. Having to travel a much shorter distance to the battle site as compared to Ngqika, Ndlambe’s great place was at Mount Coke, only 25 kilometres away from the Debe, it is probable that he selected an area which held the greater advantage for him and his men. For this, he and his men had to first cross a large area covered by the Amalinde, proving true that indeed it was the battle of Amalinde ). Ndlambe’s army was led by his son, Mdushane and further supported by the amaGcaleka nation who were led personally into the battlefield by their paramount, Chief Hintsa, who was his cousin.. Another important figure in Ndlambe had in his camp was the other charismatic millenarian prophet Nxele, otherwise known as Makana. Proclaiming himself to be the son of God, Nxele offered to Ndlambe and his men a way of thinking which provided them with some exploration of and resistance to the pressures being exerted by the encroaching whites. Ndlambe also made use of Nxele’s growing influence in his power struggle with Ngqika. \n\nWounded and facing defeat, Ngqika’s remaining army men, as led by his eldest son Maqoma, fled up to the slopes of Ntaba ka Ndoda. It is reported that over 500 men lost their lives on that fateful day in October 1818. As the sun went down on that same day, Mdushane’s men fueled huge bonfires with the lifeless bodies of Ngqika’s men, leaving behind very little of what used to be people. In the final analysis, there was no real victor between the amaNgqika and the amaNdlambe as the consequences for both were profound. Soon after the battle, Ngqika applied to the British for assistance and in December 1818, a military expedition under the leadership of Colonel Brereton set out to attack Ndlambe. Matters become extremely worse when Nxele attacked Grahamstown, albeit unsuccessfully. The amaXhosa, in their entirety, lost access to the fertile tract of the country between the Keiskamma and Fish Rivers and soon the area was filled with colonial settlers. A once proud and independent people were inexorably placed under British control. \n\n\n"}

The museum presents the experiences of children who lived through the war in Bosnia, told through objects, video testimonies, and excerpts from oral histories. The 2018 Council of Europe Museum Prize – one of the most prestigious awards in the museum industry – has been awarded to the War Childhood Museum as part of the European Museum of the Year Awards.\n\nThe project began in 2010 when Jasminko Halilovic, a Sarajevan entrepreneur, activist, and “war child,” used an online platform to collect short recollections of young adults who had been children during the Bosnian war. Over 1,000 young adults submitted their memories. Halilovic assembled these recollections into a book which was published in 2013. The book has subsequently been translated into German and Japanese.\n\nAs Halilovic began corresponding with the young adults who submitted memories, he realized that many of the former “war children” still had specific objects that they connected with their memories. He began working with a team of other young professionals to develop a museum collection, eventually collecting over 3,000 objects and over 60 oral history testimonies.\n\nIn May 2016, the War Childhood Museum held its first, temporary exhibition at the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Further exhibitions followed in the cities of Zenica and Visoko. In January 2017, the museum’s permanent exhibition opened on Logavina Street in Sarajevo.\n\nThe museum’s collections feature diaries, toys, photographs, items of clothing, and a variety of other objects donated by war survivors. All the items are presented alongside first-person recollections from the individual who donated them. In addition to the items, visitors can listen to testimonies and read snippets from oral history interviews.\n"}
