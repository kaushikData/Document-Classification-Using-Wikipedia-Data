The name means \"servant of the Helper\", \"An-Nasser\" being a Muslim theophoric name.\n\nThe letter \"a\" of the \"al-\" is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by \"u\". Because the letter \"n\" is a sun letter, the letter \"l\" of the \"al-\" can be assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to \"Abd al-Nasser\", the pronunciation can correspond to \"Abd an-Nasser\". Alternative transliterations of the last element include \"Naaser\", \"Nasir\" and others, with the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.\n\nIt may refer to:\n\n"}

At the Parisian club, he became famous for a winning header he scored in the dying seconds of a UEFA Cup quarter-final match against Real Madrid during the 1992–93 season. The header qualified PSG for the next round with a 4–1 scoreline. Kombouaré had already scored a decisive goal in similar circumstances against Anderlecht in the previous round. His habit of netting tie-deciding headers earned him the name of \"Casque d'Or\", which means \"Golden Helmet\" in French. In 1994–95, during a UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Johan Cruyff's Barcelona \"dream team\", Kombouaré captained PSG to a resounding and unexpected 2–1 win which qualified the French side for the semi-final, which they lost to Milan.\n\nIn all, Kombouaré spent five seasons in Paris, winning the Coupe de France in 1993 and 1995 and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1995. He also played nine games in the title-winning side of 1993–94 under Artur Jorge. From 1992–93, he found his first-team appearances restricted by the presence of fellow defenders Alain Roche, Paul Le Guen and Ricardo. Kombouaré became a cult hero among PSG fans for his habit of scoring late-minute winning goals and his presence and composure in big games.\n\nKombouaré signed for Swiss side Sion in 1995 for an undisclosed fee, then joined Aberdeen a year later for £300,000; he was signed by manager Roy Aitken to add experience to the shaky Aberdeen defence. He made 50 appearances for Aberdeen and scored three goals. He left Aberdeen in May 1998. To this day, he is the only player to ever take a shot that cleared the top of the Richard Donald Stand at Pittodrie.\n\nIn 2003, Kombouaré was already being tipped to coach PSG, the club where he made his name as a player, and had spent four years coaching the reserves team with positive results. However, the arrival of Vahid Halilhodžić at the helm forced him to change his plans. He therefore joined Strasbourg where he achieved an impressive 13th spot in the league, playing some good football along the way. However, a poor start to the 2004–05 season prompted him to leave the Alsace-based club.\n\nIn July 2005, Kombouaré was appointed at Valenciennes, then playing in the second tier of French football. In his first season, he led them to promotion to the top flight, a level from which the club had been relegated in 1993. In the three seasons that followed, Kombouaré helped the club to stabilize itself at the top level of French football. He improved the club's position in every season: 14th in 2006–07, 13th in 2007–08 and 12th in 2008–09, establishing his credentials as a coach who could achieve impressive results on a tight budget.\n\nIn May 2009, Kombouaré's former club PSG came calling back to him, offering him the position of manager. He accepted and signed a three-year contract, replacing Paul Le Guen, with whom he had played at Nantes and PSG. In 2009–10, the Parisian club, in spite of its new signings such as Mevlüt Erdinç and Grégory Coupet, performed poorly in the league and finished in mid-table. Kombouaré made up for this by leading the club to success in the Coupe de France, where they beat Monaco in the final.\n\nIn 2010–11, he again led the club to the Coupe de France Final, which they lost to French champions Lille. In the Coupe de la Ligue, PSG looked set for a final showdown with fierce rivals Marseille, but were stunned by Montpellier in the semi-final. The side performed much better in the league, finishing fourth in spite of a limited playing squad. The Parisians almost achieved qualification to the Champions League, but were let down by tiredness and an inability to perform when it mattered most. However, the attacking brand of football played under Kombouaré's guidance brought acclaim from both fans and writers for the capital club, with many people agreeing that PSG were playing their best football since Luis Fernandez's first spell as coach between 1994 and 1996.\n\nDuring the 2011–12 season, PSG crashed out of the Coupe de la Ligue and the Europa League during the first half of the season, and on 29 December 2011 – with his club top of the Ligue 1 table – Kombouaré was sacked by PSG sporting director Leonardo and replaced by Carlo Ancelotti, putting an end to much speculation about his position at the club. Despite holding top spot in Ligue 1 when he was sacked, the club ultimately finished as runners-up to champions Montpellier.\n\nOn 27 June 2012, it was confirmed that Kombouaré was appointed head coach of Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal FC on a one-year deal with an option for a second, but he was sacked on 31 January 2013.\n\nOn 18 June 2013, Kombouaré became manager of Lens, earning his team a promotion in his first season at the club after it finished in second place in the 2013–14 Ligue 2.\n\nOn 30 May 2016, Kombouaré became manager of Ligue 1 side Guingamp. They finished the season in mid-table. On 6 November 2018, he was sacked due to poor results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the executive editor of \"The Washington Post\" from 1968 to 1991. He became a national figure during the , when he challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers and oversaw the publication of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's stories documenting the Watergate scandal. At his death he held the title of vice president at-large of the \"Post\".\n\nHe was also an advocate for education and the study of history, including working for years as an active trustee on the boards of several major educational, historical, and archeological research institutions.\n\nA member of the Boston Brahmin Crowninshield family, Bradlee was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on , 1921. His father was Frederick Josiah Bradlee, Jr. (1892–1970), a direct descendant of Nathan Bradley—the first American Bradley, born in the colony of Massachusetts in 1631. His mother, Josephine de Gersdorff (1896–1975), was awarded the French Legion of Honour for starting an orphanage that sheltered children from Nazi Germany during World War II. Bradlee's maternal grandfather, Carl August de Gersdorff (1865–1944), the son of a German immigrant, was a wealthy New York lawyer. Bradlee's maternal grandmother was Helen Suzette Crowninshield (1868–1941), daughter of artist Frederic Crowninshield (1845–1918), another member of the Crowninshield family. His great-great-uncle was U.S. lawyer Joseph Hodges Choate, 34th U.S. ambassador to Britain, and his great uncle was Francis Welch \"Frank\" Crowninshield, the creator and editor of \"Vanity Fair\", and a roommate of Condé Nast. He had a brother named Frederick Bradlee (1919–2003), a writer and Broadway stage actor.\n\nChevalier Josephine de Gersdorff, Bradlee's mother, was a direct descendant of Heinrich XXIX, Count of Reuss-Ebersdorf, who was a lineal descendant of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, King John of Denmark, King Casimir IV of Poland, and John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst. Through his father Frederick, Bradlee was also a lineal descendant of King Henry VII of England by an unknown British woman through their son Sir Roland de Velville. His maternal great-grandfather was Dr. Ernst Bruno von Gersdorff, who was a third cousin of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom through Heinrich XXIX.\n\nBradlee, the second of three children, grew up in a wealthy family with domestic staff. With his brother, Freddy, and sister, Constance, he learned French, took piano lessons, and went to the symphony and the opera. The stock market crash of 1929 decimated the family's wealth however. During the Clutch Plague, Bradlee's father worked odd jobs to support his family, including keeping the books for various clubs and institutions and supervising the janitors at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nBradlee attended Dexter School before finishing at St. Mark's School, where he played varsity baseball. While attending St. Mark's, he contracted polio. He exercised regularly at home and developed strong arms and chest. He was able to fight off the effects of polio and could walk without limping. Thereafter he attended Harvard College, where he was a member of the A.D. Club, a Greek–English major and joined the Naval ROTC.\n\nBradlee received his naval commission two hours after graduating in 1942, joined the Office of Naval Intelligence, and worked as a communications officer in the Pacific during World War II. His duties included handling classified and coded cables, serving primarily on the destroyer USS \"Philip\" fighting off the shore of Guam and arriving at Guadalcanal with the Second Transport Group, part of Task Group 62.4, commanded by Rear Admiral Norman Scott. Bradlee's main battles were Vella Lavella, Saipan, Tinian, and Bougainville. He also fought in the biggest naval battle ever fought, the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines Campaign, in the Borneo Campaign, and made every landing in the Solomon Islands campaign.\n\nBradlee's first marriage was to Jean Saltonstall, who also came from a wealthy and prominent Boston Brahmin family. They married on , 1942, and had one son, Ben Bradlee Jr., who became a deputy managing editor of \"The Boston Globe\".\n\nAfter the war, in 1946, Bradlee became a reporter at the \"New Hampshire Sunday News\", a venture he helped launch. After he sold the paper, in 1948 he started working for \"The Washington Post\" as a reporter. He got to know associate publisher Philip Graham, who was the son-in-law of the publisher, Eugene Meyer. On , 1950, Bradlee was alighting from a streetcar in front of the White House just as two Puerto Rican nationalists attempted to shoot their way into Blair House in an attempt to kill President Harry S. Truman. In 1951 Graham helped Bradlee become assistant press attaché in the American embassy in Paris \n\nIn 1952, Bradlee joined the staff of the Office of U.S. Information and Educational Exchange (USIE), the embassy's propaganda unit. USIE produced films, magazines, research, speeches, and news items for use by the CIA throughout Europe. USIE (later known as USIA) also controlled the Voice of America, a means of disseminating pro-American \"cultural information\" worldwide. While at the USIE, according to a Justice Department memo from an assistant U.S. attorney in the Rosenberg Trial, Bradlee was helping the CIA manage European propaganda regarding the spying conviction and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on , 1953. The memo, addressed to U.S. Attorney Myles Lane and dated December 13, 1952, states that \"[Mr. Bradlee] further advised that he was sent here by Robert Thayer, who is the head of the CIA in Paris ... he stated that he was supposed to have been met by a representative of the CIA at the airport but missed connections\" and that \"he has been trying to get in touch with [CIA Director] Allen Dulles.\" \n\nThis memorandum was cited as evidence of Bradlee's CIA connections by author Deborah Davis in her 1979 biography of Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, \"Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and her Washington Post Empire\". Graham and Bradlee, in a controversial action that drew widespread accusations of censorship, demanded and obtained the recall of the book by Davis's publisher, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which first disavowed the book, and then recalled and shredded 20,000 copies. Davis subsequently won a judgment against her publisher, however, and the Justice Department memorandum that formed the primary basis for her claims regarding Bradlee's CIA affiliation was never disavowed, even by Bradlee himself. It appeared in two subsequent editions of Davis's book without challenge and was cited by author Carol Felsenthal, in her 1999 book \"Power, Privilege, and The Post: The Katharine Graham Story\". Reporter Christopher Reed, in his obituary on Bradlee in \"The Guardian\", states that Bradlee \"spent many years undercover as a counter-espionage informant, a government propagandist and an unofficial asset of the Central Intelligence Agency,\" initially by promulgating \"CIA-directed European propaganda urging the controversial execution of the convicted American spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.\"\n\nBradlee was officially employed by USIE until 1953, and he began working for \"Newsweek\" in 1954. While based in France, Bradlee divorced his first wife and married Antoinette Pinchot in 1957. At the time of the marriage, Antoinette's sister, Mary Pinchot Meyer, was married to Cord Meyer, a key figure in Operation Mockingbird, a CIA program to influence the media. Antoinette Bradlee was also a close friend of Cicely d'Autremont, who was married to CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton. Bradlee became friends with Angleton but the two allegedly parted ways after the October 12, 1964, murder of Bradlee's sister-in-law Mary Pinchot Meyer, whose CIA connections and romantic ties to the late President John F. Kennedy made her death the object of intense scrutiny. Bradlee and Angleton gave conflicting accounts of the events surrounding the search for and disposition of the diary in which Pinchot Meyer recorded her affair with Kennedy.\n\nIn 1957, while working as a reporter for \"Newsweek\", Bradlee created controversy when he interviewed members of the FLN. They were Algerian guerrillas who were in rebellion against the French government at the time.\nAccording to Deborah Davis, author of the Katharine Graham biography \"Katharine the Great\", this had all the \"earmarks of an intelligence operation\". As a result of these interviews, Bradlee was forced to leave France.\n\nAs a reporter in the 1950s, Bradlee became close friends with then-senator John F. Kennedy, who had graduated from Harvard two years before Bradlee, and lived nearby. In 1960 Bradlee toured with both Kennedy and Richard Nixon in their presidential campaigns. He later wrote a book, \"Conversations With Kennedy\" (W.W. Norton, 1975), recounting their relationship during those years. Bradlee was, at this point, Washington Bureau chief for \"Newsweek\", a position from which he helped negotiate the sale of the magazine to \"The Washington Post\" holding company. Bradlee maintained that position until being promoted to managing editor at the \"Post\" in 1965. He became executive editor in 1968.\n\nAfter Bradlee and Pinchot divorced, Bradlee married fellow journalist Sally Quinn on , 1978. Quinn and Bradlee had one child, Quinn Bradlee, who was born in 1982 when Quinn was 40 and Bradlee was 60. In 2009 they appeared with Quinn Bradlee on the \"Charlie Rose Show\" on PBS and spoke of their son's having been born with Velo-cardio-facial syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nBradlee retired as the executive editor of \"The Washington Post\" in September 1991 but continued to serve as vice president at large until his death. He was succeeded as executive editor at the \"Post\" by Leonard Downie Jr., whom Bradlee had appointed as managing editor seven years earlier.\n\nUnder Bradlee's leadership, \"The Washington Post\" took on major challenges during the Nixon administration. In 1971 \"The New York Times\" and the \"Post\" successfully challenged the government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee:\n\nYou had a lot of Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.\n\nEnsuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.\n\nIn 1981 \"Post\" reporter Janet Cooke won a Pulitzer Prize for \"Jimmy's World\", a profile of an 8-year-old heroin addict. Cooke's article turned out to be fiction: there was no such addict. As executive editor, Bradlee was roundly criticized in many circles for failing to ensure the article's accuracy. After questions about the story's veracity arose, Bradlee (along with publisher Donald Graham) ordered a \"full disclosure\" investigation to ascertain the truth. Bradlee personally apologized to Mayor Marion Barry and the chief of police of Washington, D.C., for the \"Post\"'s fictitious article. Cooke, meanwhile, was forced to resign and relinquish the Pulitzer.\n\nIn recognition of his work as editor of \"The Washington Post\", Bradlee won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism in 1998.\n\nBradlee published an autobiography in 1995, \"A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures\". He had an acting role in \"Born Yesterday\", the 1993 remake of the 1950 romantic comedy. In 1983 he gave the inaugural Vance Distinguished Lecture at Central Connecticut State University. On , 2006, Bradlee received a Doctor of Humane Letters from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Prior to receiving the honorary degree, he taught occasional journalism courses at Georgetown.\n\nIn 1991 he was persuaded by then–governor of Maryland William Donald Schaefer to accept the chairmanship of the Historic St. Mary's City Commission and continued in that position through 2003. He also served for many years as a member of the board of trustees at St. Mary's College of Maryland, and endowed the Benjamin C. Bradlee Annual Lecture in Journalism there. He continued to serve as vice chairman of the school's board of trustees.\n\nIn 1991, Bradlee delivered the Theodore H. White lecture at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. His message: Lying in Washington, whether in the White House or the Congress, is wrong, immoral, tearing at the fiber of our national instincts and institutions — and must stop. He said, \"Lying has reached such epidemic proportions in our culture and among our institutions in recent years, that we've all become immunized to it.\" He went on to suggest that the deceit was degrading the respect for the truth.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, Jim Lehrer conducted six hours of interviews with Bradlee on a variety of topics, from the responsibilities of the press to Watergate to the Valerie Plame affair. The interviews were edited for an hour-long documentary, \"Free Speech: Jim Lehrer and Ben Bradlee\", which premiered on PBS on , 2006.\n\nAt \"The Washington Post\", Bradlee carried the title vice president at large. He and Quinn lived at the Todd Lincoln House in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The middle part of the house was built in 1792. They also restored Porto Bello, their home in Drayden, Maryland.\n\nBradlee received the French Legion of Honor, the highest award given by the French government, at a ceremony in 2007 in Paris.\n\nBradlee was named as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama on , 2013, and was presented the medal at a White House ceremony on , 2013.\n\nBradlee spent his final years suffering with dementia. In late September 2014, he entered hospice care due to declining health as a result of Alzheimer's disease. He died of natural causes on , 2014, at his home in Washington, D.C., at the age of 93. His funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral on October 29. He was buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. \"The Daily Beast\" paid tribute to Bradlee by posting his quote, \"Today Our Best, Tomorrow Better\" on the wall of their office.\n\nBradlee has drawn criticism from several quarters for his perjury at the 1965 trial of the man accused of murdering Bradlee's sister-in-law Mary Pinchot Meyer, who was shot to death on October 12, 1964, while walking on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath in Georgetown. Attorneys for both the prosecution and the defense (Alfred Hantman and Dovey J. Roundtree), in addition to D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke, along with authors Peter Janney and Nina Burleigh, have all noted the significant difference between the limited information Bradlee divulged under oath at the 1965 trial, and what he revealed 30 years later in his 1995 memoir \"A Good Life\".\n\nPinchot Meyer biographers Janney and Burleigh have both criticized Bradlee's omission of substantial information under oath. \"Bradlee had excoriated Cord Meyer [Pinchot Meyer's ex-husband] for his 'derisive scorn' for the people's right to know in the 1960s, but the rules changed when the subject of a story was his sister-in-law,\" author Burleigh wrote. \"The First Amendment champion of the Watergate investigation admitted in his memoir that he gave Mary Meyer's diary to the CIA because it was 'a family document.'\"\n\nIn his 1995 memoir \"A Good Life\", Bradlee revealed that his sister-in-law's diary contained information about her affair with the late President Kennedy and the fact that Bradlee had conspired with CIA counterintelligence chief James Angleton and others to destroy it. At the 1965 trial, however, he failed to mention the diary when asked under oath what he had found when searching her studio on the night of the murder.\n\nIn a 1991 interview with the late author Leo Damore, prosecuting attorney Hantman said that having knowledge of the diary at the trial \"could have changed everything.\" In her 2009 autobiography, \"Justice Older than the Law\", defense counsel Dovey Johnson Roundtree expresses shock at learning of the diary's significance from Bradlee's book, and states,\n\nJames Angleton's awareness of the diary's existence and his interest in finding it, reading it, and destroying it – all of that unsettled me deeply when I read Mr. Bradlee's 1995 account, as did his insistence that the diary was a private document ... Had I been aware of it, I would have felt compelled to pursue it.\n\nFor many years Bradlee served on the board of trustees of St. Mary's College of Maryland. He was very active on the board and also played major roles in the establishment of the Center for the Study of Democracy at the college, where he also served on the advisory board.\n\nHe is also known for his work on the board of trustees of the Historic St. Mary's City Commission, as well as narrating a documentary produced by the organization on the history of the early Maryland colony.\n\n\n\n"}

They had a son, Sir Jeremy Cashel Thomas, born 1 June 1931; he became a diplomat.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Thomas organised concerts in British cathedrals. In 1940, she left Britain for the United States with her young son, Jeremy. While in the US she hoped to raise money for London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, where her brother was chief surgeon.\n\nHaving first met in the 1930s in England, Humby and Sir Thomas Beecham were reintroduced in the US by Andrew Schulhof, who managed each of them. He later arranged for them to perform the Delius piano concerto together in June 1941 at a studio concert for CBS.\n\nHumby married Beecham on 19 January 1943, one month after a divorce was granted from Beecham's wife Utica Celestia Welles. According to John Lucas's biography, \"Thomas Beecham: An Obsession with Music\", they were married before a police justice in Manhattan. On the advice of their legal advisers, in order to \"assure compliance with the technicalities of English law\", they underwent a second marriage on 7 September 1944, before Supreme Court Justice Samuel Null in his chambers at Country Court House, New York. They lived in New York City at 31 East 79th Street.\n\nHer best-known recording is probably that of the Delius Piano Concerto, with her husband conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, in October 1946, shortly after he had founded it. This recording of 1946 replaced an earlier version, made with the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 3 October 1945, which was not released.\n\nAccording to the Lucas biography, her performance of the Delius concerto at Lafayette, Indiana, on 1 December 1950, marked the end of Lady Betty's playing career.\n\nShe died of a heart attack in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1958. She was 50. She was cremated there and the ashes returned to England. They had been in Argentina for Beecham to conduct \"The Magic Flute\" and \"Fidelio\" at the Teatro Colón. He cancelled two rehearsals the next day, but continued his schedule. The last night of \"Fidelio\" was also his swansong as an opera conductor.\n\n"}

Construction workers may also colloquially be referred to as \"hard hat workers\" or \"hard hats\", as they often wear hardhats for safety.\n\nConstruction workers often work under a construction foreman.\n\nWhile most construction workers learn on the job as an informal apprentice to an experienced tradesman, formal apprenticeship programs are common, particularly in developed countries with trade unions.\n\nThe division of labor of construction encompasses a diverse range of skilled and manual labor.\n\nAmong the most common construction trades are those of carpenter, electrician, heavy equipment operator, ironworker, laborer, mason, plasterer, plumber, pipefitter, sheet metal worker, steel fixer (also known as a \"rodbuster\"), and welder.\n\nConstruction safety is very important to ensure a safe environment for the workers. All construction workers need to be educated on safety at each construction site to minimize injury.\n\nIn 2008, a Human Rights Watch report described unsafe and unfair working conditions and failure on the part of the Chinese government to enforce labor standards in the construction industry. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that, at the end of 2006, 90% of the 40 million construction workers in China were migrant workers. Many of the migrant workers turned to construction work after their farming communities collapsed into poverty.\n\nIn the United States, illegal immigrant labor is prevalent in the construction industry. Because of the questionable legal status of these workers, employers often have the ability to commit crimes such as wage theft and violation of workplace standards without fear of facing consequences. Similar abuse of immigrant labor is also a problem in Qatar during the lead up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup where workers mostly from poor countries in the Indian Sub-continent are forced to work in desert conditions for as little as €6.20 a day.\n\n"}

Around the year 2000, he decided to donate all his belongings to the Orthodox church when he began to live very modestly in a small extension to the Saints Cyril and Methodius parish church in his native village of Bailovo. About that time, he embarked on his mission to raise funds for the restoration of churches and monasteries across Bulgaria.

Harriman\n\nEdward Henry \"Ned\" Harriman (February 20, 1848 – September 9, 1909) was an American railroad executive.\n\nHarriman was born on February 20, 1848 in Hempstead, New York, the son of Orlando Harriman, Sr., an Episcopal clergyman, and Cornelia Neilson. He had a brother, Orlando Harriman, Jr. His great-grandfather, William Harriman, had emigrated from England in 1795 and engaged successfully in trading and commercial pursuits.\n\nAs a young boy, Harriman spent a summer working at the Greenwood Iron Furnace in the area owned by the Robert Parker Parrott family that would become Harriman State Park. He quit school at age 14 to take a job as an errand boy on Wall Street in New York City. His uncle Oliver Harriman had earlier established a career there. By age 22, he was a member of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nHarriman's father-in-law was president of the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad Company, which aroused Harriman's interest in upstate New York transportation. In 1881, Harriman acquired the small, broken-down Lake Ontario Southern Railroad. He renamed it the Sodus Bay & Southern, reorganized it, and sold it to the Pennsylvania Railroad at a considerable profit. This was the start of his career as a rebuilder of bankrupt railroads.\nHarriman was nearly 50 years old when in 1897 he became a director of the Union Pacific Railroad. By May 1898, he was chairman of the executive committee, and from that time until his death, his word was the law on the Union Pacific system. In 1903, he assumed the office of president of the company. From 1901 to 1909, Harriman was also the President of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The vision of a unified UP/SP railroad was planted with Harriman. (The UP and SP were reunited on September 11, 1996, a month after the Surface Transportation Board had approved their merger.)\n\nAt the time of his death Harriman controlled the Union Pacific, the Southern Pacific, the Saint Joseph and Grand Island, the Illinois Central, the Central of Georgia, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and the Wells Fargo Express Company. Estimates of his estate ranged from $150 million to $200 million. It was left entirely to his wife.\n\nIn 1899, Harriman sponsored and accompanied a scientific expedition to catalog the flora and fauna of the Alaska coastline. Many prominent scientists and naturalists went on the expedition, aboard the luxuriously refitted steamer \"George W. Elder\".\n\nHarriman became interested in ju-jitsu after his two-month visit to Japan in 1905. When he returned to America, he brought with him a troupe of six Japanese ju-jitsu wrestlers, including the prominent judokas Tsunejiro Tomita and Mitsuyo Maeda. Among many performances, the troupe gave an exhibition that drew six hundred spectators in the Columbia University gymnasium on February 7, 1905.\n\nIn 1879, Harriman married Mary Williamson Averell, daughter of William J. Averell, a banker in Ogdensburg, New York. Together they had:\n\n\nHarriman died on September 9, 1909 at his home, Arden, at 1:30 p.m. at age 61. Naturalist John Muir, who had joined him on the 1899 Alaska Expedition, wrote in his eulogy of Harriman, \"In almost every way, he was a man to admire.\" Harriman was buried at the St. John's Episcopal Church cemetery in the hamlet of Arden, near his estate.\n\nIn 1885, Harriman acquired \"Arden\", the Parrott family estate in the Ramapo Highlands near Tuxedo, New York, for $52,500. The property had been a source of charcoal for the Parrott Brothers Iron Works. Over the next several years he purchased almost 40 different nearby parcels of land, adding , and connected all of them with of bridle paths. His residence, Arden House, was completed only seven months before he died.\n\nIn the early 1900s, his sons W. Averell Harriman and E. Roland Harriman hired landscape architect Arthur P. Kroll to landscape many acres. In 1910, his widow donated to the state of New York for Harriman State Park. The estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966. In 1977, they gave the State of Idaho another Harriman State Park\" on several conditions. One of these was that the waters of the Henry's Fork, which flowed through the property, had to be managed for catch-and-release fly fishing. To this day it is considered one of the greatest fly fishing streams in North America.\n\n\n\n\n\"Much good work is lost for the lack of a little more.\"\n\n\"Cooperation means 'Do as I say, and do it damn quick.'\" \n\n\n\n"}

When he was 21, he went to London and worked as a printer for \"The Times\". In March 1799, he was charged with shoplifting and sentenced to death, but this was commuted to transportation for life to New South Wales. Howe arrived at Sydney on 22 November 1800.\n\nA small printing press had been brought to Australia by Governor Arthur Phillip, and a convict named George Hughes used it to print a considerable number of orders, rules and regulations. Soon after he arrived George Howe became the government printer, and in 1802 printed \"New South Wales General Standing Orders\" consisting of 146 pages, the first book to be printed in Australia. In May 1803 Governor King, in a dispatch to Lord Hobart, mentioned the establishment of the \"Sydney Gazette\" as a weekly publication—its first number had appeared on 5 March and asked that a new font of type should be sent to Sydney. The paper was carried on at the risk of Howe, who, though he had been fully emancipated in 1806, did not receive a salary as government printer until 1811 when he was granted only £60 a year. In the meantime Howe conducted the \"Gazette\" under difficulties, often running out of paper and suffering much from patrons who fell behind in their subscriptions. In 1810 a lightning strike almost destroyed Howes's printing office. Howe tried various expedients to keep his household going, at one time keeping a school and at another becoming a professional debt collector. Another of these expedients was becoming a professional mobile food stand for the public, he did this for 3 years.\n\nIn addition to the \"Gazette\" Howe began the publication of the \"New South Wales Pocket Almanac\" in 1806, which became a regular yearly publication from 1808 to 1821. He also began trading in sandalwood, and in 1813 found himself liable for over £90 of duty on two consignments. He appears to have become more prosperous, as in 1817 he was one of the original subscribers when the Bank of New South Wales was founded. Howe died on 11 May 1821 and left an estate of £400. He was married twice, and his second wife survived him with children of both marriages. He seems to have been a man of indomitable spirit and, considering his difficulties, was a good printer and editor. The memorial placed in the printing office by his son stated that \"his charity knew no bounds\".\n\nHowe's eldest son, Robert (1795–1829), helped his father from age 9, but as a teenager rebelled, indulging in excessive alcohol consumption and fathering an illegitimate child before converting to Methodism under the guidance of Ralph Mansfield and returning to the family business in 1820. He printed the first magazine, \"The Australian Magazine; or, Compendium of Religious, Literary, and Miscellaneous Intelligence\" (1821), hymn-book, \"An Abridgment of the Wesleyan Hymns, selected from the larger Hymn-book published in England\" (1821), and Church of England hymn-book, \"Select Portions of the Psalms of David etc.\" (1828), in Australia. The first volume of verse published by a native-born Australian \"Wild Notes from the Lyre of a Native Minstrel\" by Charles Tompson junior, which appeared in 1826, is an excellent example of R. Howe's typographical work. Like many other editors in colonial Australia, Howe was implicated in several libel suits. Moreover, his editorial policies, stemming from his religious convictions and the newspaper's continuing support for the government, led to him being horsewhipped by William Redfern. Starting 1 January 1821, the \"Gazette\" was jointly edited by Mansfield, a division of duties that Howe hoped would facilitate his retirement from the newspaper. Less than a month later, on 29 January 1829, Howe drowned in a boating accident off Fort Denison, leaving his wife, Ann, as proprietor of the \"Gazette\" and Mansfield as the editor.\n\nGeorge Terry Howe (c. 1806–63), Robert's younger half-brother by his father's common law wife, Elizabeth Easton, went to Launceston, Tasmania in October 1821, becoming the town's first printer and the founding editor of the \"Tasmanian and Port Dalrymple Advertiser\". In 1825, he was persuaded by the Lt. Governor Sir George Arthur to form a partnership with James Ross in Hobart, where he was appointed government printer and co-edited the \"Hobart Town Gazette\". In 1827, he left the \"Gazette\" to edit the \"Tasmanian\" for six months before returning to Sydney. He died there on 6 April 1863. He was married and had six daughters and a son.\n"}

Jacobs' accusers included his daughter-in-law and granddaughter, Margaret.\n\nJacobs is believed to be the George Jacob baptized 13 February 1608/09 at St. Dunstan in the West, London, son of barber-surgeon George Jacob and wife Priscilla of Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire.\n\nJacobs' body was buried near where he was hanged. In the 1970s bones were found that were believed to be his. They were tested and found to have osteoarthritis. George Jacobs walked with two canes.

His mother, \"née\" Hagi-Panteli, was from Bucharest. Gheorghe added \"Fontanin\" to his name; this was a latinization of his father's native village, Izvoarele (\"the streams\"). Associated with the Latinist school of Romanian culture, he later helped edit a Latin-Romanian dictionary.\n\nHe studied in Brașov and in a private boarding school at Sibiu. He continued his education at Cluj and at the University of Vienna, where he took a doctorate in philosophy. In 1848, he was in Bucharest, a participant in that year's revolution, but fled to Sibiu for a few months after the city was occupied by the Ottomans. He later returned to Bucharest and in 1851 moved to Craiova, where he became director of the Central School, which had shut down during the revolution. In 1853, early in the Crimean War, the Russian Army closed the school and turned it into a hospital. Fontanin protested and was imprisoned for seven months, but managed to reopen the following year. He ardently supported the Union of Wallachia with Moldavia, and in 1857 presided over the election of Dolj County deputies for the ad-hoc divan.\n\nFontanin was noted for his considerable knowledge and reserved demeanor, and only formed a few friendships. Preoccupied by scientific problems and uncommunicative, he was seen as a legendary figure by the students. He taught various subjects: in the 1850s, he was responsible for Romanian, Latin, history and geography for one grade, and also served as inspector. In 1864, he took on the newly introduced subject of philosophy. His penchant for latinization extended to the schoolboys' names. He often spent summer vacations in Rome, deepening his studies and purchasing books in Latin, Italian, French, German and English, all languages he knew well, in addition to Hungarian and Old Church Slavonic. He was a gifted translator from Latin, also working on Greek philosophy and literature, as well as modern languages. Due to Fontanin's almost pathological reticence, many of his writings remained unpublished.\n\nIn 1870, he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy.

This stewardship is usually outside the acceptance of authority figures, hence the guerrilla or underground nature of the action taken. Guerrilla librarianship can be politicized and occasionally controversial.\n\nWith the rise of electronic resources, some more “traditional” librarians in the San Francisco Public Library system were reported to hide books to protect them from destruction. In a column in the April 1997 ALA publication \"American Libraries\", the reference librarian Will Manley referred to these librarians as “guerrilla librarians.” The librarians attempted to save the books marked for destruction or the discard pile by stamping them with incorrect due dates.\n\nIn 1987, a planning study was conducted by library consultants Becker & Hayes Inc. This study found that “The library will pursue an active 'weeding' program in the next two decades to extend the useful life of the facility... up to 50 percent of the material could be located off-site.” In 1988, Proposition A was passed by voters to provide $109.5 million for the New Main Library to double existing space and would be applied to just the new building. Other resources such as furniture and equipment had to be covered by the public-private partnership called The Library Foundation. After the October 17, 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, City Librarian Ken Dowlin applied to the Federal Emergency Management Authority for a $1 million grant. With this funding, he changed the organization of the books from the Dewey Decimal System to a system he referred to as “leveled access.”\n\nThe Mercury Project involved the purchase of new computers, including a supercomputer from the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for an online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC). The Alexandrian Project aimed to build a new main library building using computers and electronic resources more than books. In 1995, 250,000 library books were weeded, including old, rare and some last copies. Some librarians resisted this idea of the “Library of the Future” that Dowlin\nhad envisioned. This resistance to these changes created the term “guerrilla librarian,” a librarian who saves books from destruction by either hiding them or stamping them to make the books appear that they had been in recent circulation.\n\nIn the Word Watch of April 1997, \"The Atlantic Monthly\" defined guerrilla librarianship as “the use of surreptitious measures by librarians determined to resist the large-scale 'deaccessioning' of rarely used books: 'A branch librarian ... sometimes goes around with a due-date stamp, furtively stamping into currency books that she feels are imperiled... [Employees of the San Francisco Public Library] call it “guerrilla librarianship”' (The New Yorker).”\n\nIn more recent history, the term “guerrilla librarian” has been used to refer to Mick Jones of The Clash. His recent efforts in July 2009 created the Rock-n-Roll Public Library in London. Including 10,000 items from the guitarist's private collection, the library also contains Clash artwork and Beatles memorabilia. This exhibition is free as a “direct artistic challenge to the likes of the corporate British Music Experience.”\n\nOther guerrilla librarians include organizations such as Biologists Helping Bookstores, private citizen scientists re-shelving books to prevent pseudoscience from being placed in with the science categories. In comparison to the original 1997 usage of the term, this version of guerrilla librarianship involves the removal or rearrangement of books by the general public regarding bookstores as opposed to librarians in public library settings.\n\n\n"}

When filing opened in 1995 for her seat, Obama entered the race. Eventually, his challengers were disqualified and he won the Democratic primary unopposed in 1996. He won re election in 1998 and 2002. During his Senate tenure, Obama was involved with a wide range of legislation. \n\nWhile serving, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in the 2000 elections. In the redistricting following 2000 Census, the Democrats gained control of the Illinois Senate, and Obama became more active in his legislation, which included work in areas such as health care, labor, law enforcement, campaign finance reform, welfare, and community reinvestment.\n\nOn November 21, 1994, Senator Alice Palmer, a Democrat of Chicago's South Shore neighborhood announced she was launching a campaign committee to raise funds to run in 1996 for the 2nd congressional district seat of indicted U.S. Representative Mel Reynolds, and suggested that 29-year-old Jesse Jackson, Jr. run for her 13th district Illinois Senate seat in 1996 instead of running against her for Congress.\n\nOn June 27, 1995, Palmer announced she was running for Congress and would be giving up her Senate seat instead of running for re-election in 1996. The following week, newspapers reported that Palmer-supporter Barack Obama of Hyde Park—who had been announced as chairman of the $49.2 million Chicago Annenberg Challenge on June 22 and whose memoir \"Dreams from My Father\" would be published on July 18—would announce he was running for Palmer's 13th district seat, which was then a T-shaped district that spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park-Kenwood south through South Shore and from the lakefront west through Chicago Lawn.\n\nOn September 11, 1995, Governor Jim Edgar set November 28 as the date for a special primary election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mel Reynolds following his August 1995 conviction. On September 19, Obama announced his Illinois Senate candidacy to an audience of 200 supporters at the Ramada Inn Lakeshore in Hyde Park-Kenwood. Palmer introduced and endorsed Obama as her successor to supporters that included 4th Ward Alderwoman Toni Preckwinkle of Hyde Park, newly elected 5th Ward Alderwoman Barbara Holt of Hyde Park, and state Representative Barbara Flynn Currie (D-25) of Hyde Park.\n\nOn November 7, 1995, Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, died of metastatic uterine cancer at the age of 52 in Honolulu. Obama arrived in Hawaii the following day, remained for his mother's memorial service and returned to Chicago soon after. On November 28, after finishing a distant third in the special congressional primary election won by Jesse Jackson, Jr., a disappointed Palmer announced she wouldn't seek re-election and was undecided about again challenging Jackson in the March 1996 primary.\n\nOn December 11, 1995—the first filing day for nominating petitions—Obama filed his nominating petitions with more than 3,000 signatures; perennially unsuccessful candidate Ulmer Lynch, Jr., also filed nominating petitions. On December 18—the last filing day for nominating petitions—Palmer held a press conference to announce she was running for re-election to the Senate, accepting a draft by more than 100 supporters. Palmer then drove to Springfield to file her nominating petitions; also filing nominating petitions on the last filing day were first-time candidates Gha-is Askia and Marc Ewell. On December 26, Obama campaign volunteer Ron Davis filed objections to the legitimacy of the nominating petitions of Senator Palmer, Askia, Ewell and Lynch.\n\nOn January 17, 1996, Palmer announced she was withdrawing her bid for re-election because she was around 200 signatures short of the 757 needed to earn a place on the ballot after almost two-thirds of the 1,580 signatures on her nominating petitions were found to be invalid. The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners had previously sustained an objection to the nominating petitions of Lynch because of insufficient valid signatures and subsequently also sustained objections to the nominating petitions of Askia and Ewell because of insufficient valid signatures.\n\nObama therefore won the Democratic nomination unopposed. On November 5, Obama won the race for the 13th Senate district, with 82 percent of the vote; perennially unsuccessful Harold Washington Party candidate David Whitehead (13%) and first-time Republican Party candidate Rosette Caldwell Peyton (5%) also ran.\n\nObama was up for reelection in 1998; Illinois state senators serve one two-year term and two four-year terms each decade. In the March 17 primary, Obama won re-nomination unopposed, and first-time candidate Yesse Yehudah won the Republican nomination unopposed. At the November 3 general election, Obama was re-elected to a four-year term as state senator for the 13th district with 89% of the vote; Yehudah received 11% of the vote.\n\nObama won both the March 19 Democratic primary election and November 5, 2002 general election for the newly configured 13th district unopposed. \n\nOn January 8, 1997, Obama was sworn in as senator. Early in his first term, the just-retired U.S. Senator Paul Simon contacted longtime Obama mentor, judge and former congressman Abner Mikva suggesting that Mikva recommend Obama to Emil Jones, Jr., the powerful Democratic leader of the state Senate. \"Say, our friend Barack Obama has a chance to push this campaign finance bill through,\" Simon said in a telephone conversation, as recounted by Mikva in a 2008 interview, \"Why don’t you call your friend Emil Jones and tell him how good he is.\" With Jones' support, Obama helped shepherd through a sweeping law that banned most gifts from lobbyists and personal use of campaign funds by state legislators.\n\nDuring his first years as a state senator, Obama was a co-sponsor of a bill that re-structured the Illinois welfare program into the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. He also helped get various pieces of legislation that established a $100 million Earned Income Tax Credit for working families, increased child care subsidies for low-income families, and required advance notice before mass layoffs and plant closings passed.\n\nIn September 1999, Obama and fellow Senator Donne Trotter (neither faced re election that year) both announced their candidacies for the March 2000 Democratic primary election for the U.S. House of Representatives seat, held by four term incumbent candidate Bobby Rush. \n\nRush had been badly defeated in the February 1999 Chicago mayoral election by Richard M. Daley — who won 45% of the African-American vote and even won Rush's own ward — and was thought to be vulnerable. The support of some veteran Democratic fundraisers who saw Obama as a rising star, along with support of African-American entrepreneurs, helped him keep pace with Rush's fundraising in the district's most expensive race ever.\n\nDuring the campaign, Rush charged that Obama was not sufficiently rooted in Chicago's black neighborhoods to represent constituents' concerns, and also benefitted from an outpouring of sympathy when his son was shot to death shortly before the election. Obama said Rush was a part of \"a politics that is rooted in the past\" and said he himself could build bridges with whites to get things done. \n\nBut while Obama did well in his own Hyde Park base, he didn't get enough support from the surrounding black neighborhoods. Starting with just 10 percent name recognition, Obama went on to get only 31 percent of the votes, losing by a more than 2-to-1 margin despite winning among white voters.\n\nAfter losing the primary for U.S. Congress to Bobby Rush, Obama worked to repair relations with black politicians and clergy members, telling them he bore no grudges against the victor. He also became more responsive to requests for state funding, getting money for churches and community groups in his district. Senator Trotter, then the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in 2008 that he knew Obama was responding more to funding requests \"because the community groups in his district stopped coming to me\".\n\nIn September 2001, Democrats won a lottery to redraw legislative districts that had been drawn ten years earlier by Republicans and had helped ensure ten uninterrupted years of Republican control of the Illinois Senate. At the November 2002 election, the Democratic remap helped them win control of the Illinois Senate and expand their majority in the Illinois House to work with the first Democratic Illinois governor in 26 years. \n\nIn January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, after six years on the committee and four years as its minority spokesman. The new Democratic majority allowed Obama to write and help pass more legislation than in previous years. He sponsored successful efforts to expand children's health care, create a plan to provide equal health care access for all Illinois residents, and create a \"Hospital Report Card\" system, and worker's rights laws that protected whistleblowers, domestic violence victims, equal pay for women, and overtime pay. \n\nHis most public accomplishment was a bill requiring police to videotape interrogations and confessions in potential death penalty cases. Obama was willing to listen to Republicans and police organizations and negotiate compromises to get the law passed. That helped him develop a reputation as a pragmatist able to work with various sides of an issue. Obama also led the passage of a law to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they stopped.\n\nIn February 2002, Obama introduced SB 1789, which would have adopted instant-runoff voting (IRV) for congressional and state primary elections in Illinois and authorized IRV for local elections, although it did not ultimately pass. He resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.\n\n"}

He was a descendant of Solomon Luria, and traced his genealogy back through Rashi to the tanna Johanan HaSandlar. He was rabbi of , Minsk Voivodeship until 1711, when he was called to the rabbinate of Minsk, where he officiated also as head of the yeshibah until his death. Heilprin was one of the most eminent Talmudists of his time. He was opposed to casuistry, and on this account succeeded in grouping around him a great number of liberal-minded pupils. For a long time he had to sustain a hard struggle with Aryeh Löb ben Asher, who, while still a young man, had founded a yeshibah at Minsk, which at first was very flourishing. Aryeh Löb attacked Heilprin's method of teaching, and the antagonism between them spread to their pupils. Later, Aryeh Löb, being obliged to assist his father in the district rabbinate, neglected his yeshibah, which was ultimately closed, and Heilprin was no longer molested.\n\nHeilprin devoted a part of his time to the study of Kabala, on which subject he wrote a work. He was opposed to giving approbations to new books, deviating, as he himself says, only twice from his general principle in this regard. The two works so favored were the \"Ir Ḥomah\" of Abraham Judah Elijah and the \"Magen HaElef\" of Aryeh Löb of Plock.\n\nHeilprin is especially known through his \"Seder HaDorot.\" This work consists of three independent volumes or parts:\n\nThe whole work is followed by notes on the Talmud, also arranged in alphabetical order.

He was an English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, followed by Columbia University from 1909 and 1937. During his tenure at Columbia University he formulated the General Honors Course—responsible for inspiring the influential Great Books movement. He published over 100 books, novels, criticism, and essays including his most important essay, \"The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent\" (1915).\n\nErskine was born in New York City, New York, the son of Eliza Jane (née Hollingsworth) and James Morrison Erskine. and raised in Weehawken, New Jersey. He graduated from Columbia University, B.A., 1900, M.A. 1901 and Ph. D., 1903 and D. Litt. 1929, besides D. Litt. degree from Amherst in 1923.\n\nProfessor Erskine was English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, and subsequently taught at Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. In 1910, he led foundation of the Boar's Head Society for literature. In 1920, he instituted Columbia College's General Honors Course, a two-year undergraduate seminar that would later help inspire \"Masterworks of Western Literature,\" now known commonly as \"Literature Humanities,\" the second component of Columbia College's Core Curriculum. This course taught the classics in translation instead of the original Latin or Greek, a concept he elaborated in his noted essay \"The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent\". He found little support for the course from the senior faculty, and junior faculty members like Mark Van Doren and later after 1923, Mortimer Adler took up sections of the course. This course would later go on to inspire the Great Books movement, centered on the Great Books of the Western World. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. In 1929, Adler left Columbia to join University of Chicago, where he continued to work on the theme with Robert Hutchins, President of the University. Together they subsequently went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation.\n\nErskine co-wrote the 1900 Varsity Show at Columbia, writing the musical score for \"The Governor's Vrouw\" (1900), a two-act comic opera by Henry Sydnor Harrison and poet Melville Cane, who also wrote the lyrics. He won the Butler Medal in 1919. During his career Erskine published over 100 books, though as a writer he first received acclaim with his novel \"The Private Life of Helen of Troy\" (1925). This novel was made into a silent film by the same the name in 1927, directed by Alexander Korda. Other films based on his works included \"A Lady Surrenders\" (1930) by John M. Stahl, \"Bachelor of Arts\" (1934) by Louis King and \"The President's Mystery\" (1936) directed by Phil Rosen. The 1956 biopic of French noblewoman Diane de Poitiers entitled \"Diane\" was based on his story with a screenplay by Christopher Isherwood. He was also the author of numerous publications, including several humorous novels retelling myths and legends, besides essays, criticism, and two volumes of autobiography. These included \"Penelope's Man\" and \"Adam and Eve, Though He Knew Better\".\n\nErskine was also an accomplished composer, pianist and musician. He wrote several books of music and the libretto for George Antheil's opera \"Helen Retires\" (1931), which was based on \"The Private Life of Helen of Troy\". He was the first president of the Juilliard School of Music from 1928 to 1937. He was also director of the Metropolitan Opera Association, which runs the Metropolitan Opera, a noted opera company based in New York City.\n\nErskine is also credited with writing the subtitles for a number of films, including Sacha Guitry's \"Le Roman d'un tricheur\" (The Story of a Cheat) in 1938, Marcel Pagnol's \"The Baker's Wife\" in 1940 and Mario Camerini's \"The Spirit and the Flesh\", an adaptation of Alessandro Manzoni's classic novel \"The Betrothed\", in 1948.\n\nTo commemorate the seven hundredth anniversary of Roger Bacon, Erskine wrote \"A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century,\" a biographical play which was produced at Columbia University and published as a book by Columbia University Press in 1914. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of his papers. In 1946 he served as the first chairman of the American Writers Association.\n\nHe was married twice to Pauline Ives (m. 1910–1945) and Helen Worden Erskine (m. 1946–1951). With his wife Pauline (Ives), he was the grandfather of actress Lindsay Crouse and the great-grandfather of actress Zosia Mamet.

He served at Auschwitz as chief of the Central Construction Office of the Waffen-SS. While there he was chief of construction of the Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp.\n\nBorn in Neuhemsbach near Kaiserslautern, Germany. At the age of twenty, he joined the Luftwaffe. In 1935 he obtained a job at the Luftwaffe Construction Bureau. During the early years of the Second World War, he was involved in the building of air bases in France. In this position he met SS-\"Gruppenführer\" Hans Kammler, who was responsible for the SS-Amt II (Building), which later became \"Amtsgruppe C\" of the WVHA. Kammler offered Bischoff a leading post at Auschwitz.\n\nIn October 1941 Bischoff arrived in Auschwitz, where he became chief of the Central Construction Office of the Waffen-SS and the Police Auschwitz in Upper Silesia (for \"i. Zentralbauleitung der Waffen SS und Polizei, Auschwitz O/S\") that had to implement the planned enlargement of the concentration camp by the creation of a POW camp, which itself later became part of the Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp. He showed his ambition shortly after his arrival by claiming the enormous budget of 20 million Reichsmarks. Unlike his predecessor, Bischoff was an extremely competent and dynamic bureaucrat. Despite all of the difficulties caused by the war, the building activities deemed necessary during the next years were all carried out by Bischoff and his staff. The giant Birkenau camp, the four big crematoria, the technically complicated central sauna, the new reception building in the Stammlager and hundreds of other buildings, were planned and realized. For instance, Bischoff laid out the construction plans for the building of Auschwitz II-Birkenau with an original tally of 550 prisoners in each barrack (this meant that each prisoner had one-third the amount of space that he or she was allotted in other Nazi German concentration camps). He changed this tally to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.\n\nIn 1943 the chief builder of the crematoria was able to inform his superiors in Berlin about the success of the operation: when the old crematorium in the \"Stammlager\" was included, 4,756 persons could be burned within 24 hours in five crematoria. In 1944, Bischoff was awarded the War Merit Cross, 1st class, but shortly afterward he was informed that further plans for Auschwitz had to be reduced to those facilities considered absolutely necessary. The faltering German position at the Eastern Front did not favour further development in the area.\n\nIn April 1944 he left Auschwitz and became chief of the building bureau of the Waffen-SS in Silesia and Bohemia at Katowice. He remained there until the end of the war. Although almost all of the archives of the Auschwitz building office fell into the hands of the Soviets after the camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945, Bischoff remained in the shadows after the war ended. His involvement at Auschwitz went unrecognized until his death in Bremen in 1950.\n"}

She campaigned against exclusion, violence, racism and injustice. A polyglot and a suffragist, she was a pioneer of feminism in Quebec. A Syndicalist, Communist and a Marxist, she opened the first Marxist book store in Montreal.\n\nBorn in Montreal on Guilbault Street in 1903, the second of nine children, she was the daughter of Polish Jewish immigrants. Her father was a tailor who, along with his wife, Fanny, ran a general store. They were the only Jews in Beauport, the town where Roback grew up. She spoke Yiddish at home, French with Beauport locals, and English at school. Her family valued reading and the arts. In her youth, she was influenced by her maternal grandmother, an independent woman.\n\nWith her family, Roback returned to Montreal in 1915. While working at British American Dyeworks, she became aware of the differences between the various sectors of Montreal society. Her next job was as a cashier at Her Majesty's Theatre. Interested in literature, she saved money to enroll at the University of Grenoble in 1926, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree. On her return from Grenoble, she joined her sister in New York City. In 1929, she went to Berlin to visit her brother Henri, a medical student. She learned the German language, took university courses, and taught English. She also visited England and Italy, developing a strong commitment to Communism.\n\nIn 1929, Roback became a member of the Communist Party of Canada. She felt seduced by the socialists, but she believed they did not put their words into action, hence she shifted her support to Marxism-Leninism. In her 1988 interview with Nicole Lacelle, Roback said that it was during this period that she gained genuine political consciousness. In the fall of 1932, when the war in Europe escalated, Roback, a Jew and a foreigner, was forced to leave return to Montreal. In 1934, she spent a few months in the Soviet Union with a lover. Returning for good to Montreal, she participated in the organization of the unemployed, which was led by Norman Bethune. She also worked at the Young Women's Hebrew Association. In 1935, she established the first Marxist bookshop in Montreal, Modern Book Shop. \n\nWith Thérèse Casgrain, Roback fought for woman's suffrage in Quebec in 1936. In the same year, she worked with Rose Pesotta, a veteran union organizer from New York, to establish the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in Montreal, leading a strike of 5,000 women in 1937. Roback unionized RCA Victor in 1941, where she remained until 1951. She won the first union contract for women in 1943 but did not want to become a union representative or climb up union power structure. In the same year, Roback became a political organizer for Fred Rose. She left the Communist party in 1958.\n\nIn 1960, she became a member and played an active role in the organization \"Voice of Women\" (\"La Voix des Femmes\" in Montreal) alongside Madeleine Parent, Thérèse Casgrain, and Simonne Monet-Chartrand. She denounced the Vietnam War and apartheid in South Africa, campaigned against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and was a proponent of free access to a quality education. A feminist, she fought to obtain the right to vote for the right to abortion and access to contraception. Roback also fought for the residents of Saint-Henri to receive decent housing. At the age of 83 and in the pouring rain, she participated in the women's march for pay equity. In 1985, she became an honorary member of the Canadian Institute for Research on Women. She died in Côte-des-Neiges in 2000, becoming a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in the same year.\n\nHer memory is perpetuated by the work of the Lea Roback Foundation, created in 1993, which provides scholarships to socially-committed women. \"Le centre Léa-Roback\", a research center in Montreal for social inequalities, is also named in her honour, as is the Maison Parent-Roback in Old Montreal. Sophie Bissonnette made a documentary on Roback's life in 1991. Two streets were named in her honour in the 2000s: Rue Léa-Roback in the Saint-Henri district of Montreal, and a street of the same name in Beauport, where she spent time in her youth.\n\nThe Léa Roback Foundation (Fondation Léa Roback) awards scholarships to women residing in Québec who are socially committed and economically disadvantaged.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30867957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30867957", "title": "Metabiography", "text": "Metabiography\n\nMetabiography is the literary study of the relation of biographies to the temporal, geographical, institutional, intellectual or ideological locations of their writers (the biographers). It is a hermeneutics of biography that sees the biographical subject (the “biographee”) as a collective construct of different memory cultures, proposing an essential instability of historical lives. In the words of Steven Shapin, metabiography stresses “that shifting biographical traditions make one person have many lives,” none of these necessarily more real than any other, because all are “configured and reconfigured according to the sensibilities and needs of the changing cultural settings.” In this sense, metabiography expresses a belief in the observer-dependence of historical knowledge.\n\nAs part of the preparations for their own writings, biographers have traditionally examined previous biographical studies. For these authors, dealing with predecessors has served such purposes as establishing the factual inadequacy of earlier efforts, staking one’s own claim against prior “myths” and “mistakes,” or has been intended simply as laying the groundwork for a new and more “definitive” study. Metabiography, however, goes beyond writing about the strengths or weaknesses of preceding biographical studies in interpreting a life. It is less concerned with the authenticity of biographical representations than with their relational nature. \nIt has been argued that in the history of science, metabiography has a long tradition of over fifty years, stretching from Henry Guerlac’s study of “Lavoisier and his biographers” to A. Rupert Hall’s edition of eighteenth-century Newton biographies and beyond. However, to these scholars, the study of former biographers had a propaedeutic function vis-à-vis the biographical works of their own time. They did not follow a relational approach and thus do not meet the crucial criterion for metabiographical studies.\n\nIn the field of biographies of artists and writers, the metabiographical approach was followed e.g. by David Dennis for Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), and Lucasta Miller who used it to good effect in the case Emily Brontë (1818–48). \nGordon S. Wood’s study on the Americanization of Benjamin Franklin, however, is not metabiography, although the Franklin literature would provide ideal material for such a study.\n\nExamples of scientific metabiography are Jan Sapp’s “The nine lives of Gregor Mendel,” Patricia Fara’s \"Newton: the Making of Genius\" and Nicolaas Rupke’s \"Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography\". James Moore and Ralph Colp have applied the metabiographical approach to Charles Darwin. A metabiographical slant is also discernible in the \"Reader’s Guide to the History of Science\" (2000).\n"}

He picked up a silver medal in the 200m in wet and windy conditions, but was just edged out of the medals in the 800m behind his teammate, Moatez Jomni.\n\nAfter struggling with illness in 2015, Bushell made an encouraging return to action in 2016 by winning the European title in the T53 100m in Grosseto, as well as a 400m bronze. Later that year he competed in the 2016 Paraolympic games in Rio defending his 100m, although was only able to manage a disappointing sixth-place finish crossing the line in 15.09s.\n\nBushell is the current British Record holder for the T53 class in the 100m and 200m events, and also the European record holder at 100m.\n\nBushell suffers from lumbar sacral spinal sgenesis congenital paraplegia. In Bushell's case this means he is missing seven vertebrae from the lower part of the spine just above the coccyx. He has no abdominal wall muscle control, his legs and hips have never fully developed and float unsupported at the lower end of his body.\n\nIn 2007 during his preparations for the Paraolympic games in Beijing Bushell began suffering from recurrent kidney infection necessitating a nephrectomy. Despite this potentially career ending condition just three months after the operation he recorded a personal best in the 100m to qualify for the Beijing Paralympics, where he won a silver in the T53.\n\nShoulder and elbow injuries in 2013 and 2014 further threatened his career, but despite this he still managed to claim silver at the IPC World Championships in Lyon and two medals at the IPC European Championships in Swansea.\n\nRecurrent urinary tract infections in 2015 culminated in life-threatening septacaemia. At the time this was incorrectly reported by the BBC as a chlamydia infection. He subsequently made a complete recovery, although his training was significantly set back the seven month recuperation peroid.\n\nAfter winning gold in London 2012 Bushell was honored with a golden postbox in his home town of Telford.\n\nIn 2013 he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the New Year Honours for services to athletics.\n\nBushell lives in Telford where he works as a personal trainer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "301237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301237", "title": "Mike Huckabee", "text": "Mike Huckabee\n\nMichael Dale Huckabee (born August 24, 1955) is an American politician, Christian minister, author, and commentator who served as the 44th governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. He was a candidate in the United States Republican presidential primaries in both 2008 and 2016.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Huckabee hosted the Fox News Channel talk show \"Huckabee\", ending the show in January 2015 in order to explore a potential bid for the presidency. From April 2012 through December 2013, he hosted a daily radio program, \"The Mike Huckabee Show\", on weekday afternoons for Cumulus Media Networks. Huckabee is the author of several best-selling books, an ordained Southern Baptist minister noted for his evangelical views, a musician, and a public speaker. He is also a political commentator on \"The Huckabee Report.\"\n\nIn the 2008 Republican presidential primaries, Huckabee won the 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses and finished second in delegate count and third in both popular vote and number of states won, behind John McCain and Mitt Romney. Huckabee ran again for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election, suspending his campaign on February 1, 2016 and becoming one of Donald Trump's most ardent supporters. His daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, currently serves as President Trump's White House Press Secretary.\n\nHuckabee was born on August 24, 1955, in Hope, Arkansas, the son of Dorsey Wiles Huckabee and his wife Mae (Elder) Huckabee, conservative Southern Democrats. Huckabee is of English, German, and Scots-Irish ancestry, with roots in America dating to the Colonial Era. He has cited his working-class upbringing as the reason for his political views; his father worked as a fireman and mechanic, and his mother worked as a clerk at a gas company.\n\nHis first job, when he was 14, was at a radio station, where he read the news and weather. He was elected governor of Arkansas by his chapter of the American Legion–sponsored Boys State program in 1972. He was student council vice president at Hope High School during the 1971–72 school year. He was student council president at Hope High School during the 1972–73 school year. He has one sister, Mrs. Pat Harris, a middle school teacher. He entered the ministry in 1972 at Garrett Memorial Baptist Church in Hope.\n\nHuckabee married Janet (McCain) on May 25, 1974. He graduated from Ouachita Baptist University on May 8, 1978, completing his bachelor's degree in religion before attending Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He dropped out of the seminary after one year in order to take a job in Christian broadcasting.\n\nAt age 21, Huckabee was a staffer for televangelist James Robison. Robison commented, \"His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes.\" Prior to his political career, he served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from 1980 to 1986, and the Beech Street First Baptist Church in Texarkana, from 1986 to 1992.\n\nHuckabee started 24-hour television stations in both Pine Bluff and Texarkana, where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called \"Positive Alternatives\". He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid-1980s. Years later, he wrote about the insights he gained as a minister:\n\nIn 1989, Huckabee ran against Ronnie Floyd of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.\n\nIn Huckabee's first political race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Democratic senator Dale Bumpers, receiving 40 percent of the vote in the general election. In the same election, Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was elected president, making lieutenant governor Jim Guy Tucker the new governor when Clinton resigned the governorship. In 1993, Republican state chairman Asa Hutchinson urged Huckabee to run in the special election for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers's campaign manager the previous year, 51–49 percent. Huckabee became the second Republican since Reconstruction to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been Maurice Britt from 1967 to 1971.\n\nIn his autobiography \"From Hope to Higher Ground\", Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: \"The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier.\"\n\nDick Morris, who had previously worked for Bill Clinton, advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994, and 1998. Huckabee commented that Morris was a \"personal friend\". A newspaper article reported on Huckabee's 1993 win: \"Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a progressive campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.'\"\n\nMorris elaborated, \"So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans.\" Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and civil rights organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, \"I will not participate in any program that has racist overtones. I've spent a lifetime fighting [against] racism and anti-Semitism.\"\n\nIn 1994 Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote. While lieutenant governor, Huckabee accepted $71,500 in speaking fees and traveling expenses from a nonprofit group, Action America. R. J. Reynolds was the group's largest contributor.\n\nIn October 1995, David Pryor announced that he was retiring from the United States Senate. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved ahead in the polls, but ultimately dropped out of the race to lead the state after incumbent governor Jim Guy Tucker resigned following his fraud and conspiracy convictions.\n\nDuring his campaign, Huckabee opposed in December then-governor Tucker's plan for a constitutional convention. The plan was defeated by voters, 80–20 percent, in a special election. In January 1996, Huckabee campaigned in televised ads paid for by the Republican National Committee and the Arkansas Republican Party against a highway referendum. Tucker supported the referendum, which included tax increases and a bond program, to improve of highway. On the referendum, the bond question, which included a sales tax increase and a gas tax increase, lost 87–13 percent. A second question, a five-cent increase on diesel tax, lost 86–14 percent. Huckabee also opposed Tucker's plan for school consolidation.\n\nIn May 1996, Tucker was convicted \"on one count of arranging nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans\" as part of the Whitewater controversy. The Arkansas Constitution, like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. Tucker thus promised to resign by July 15. Huckabee then announced he would quit the Senate race and instead fill the unexpired term of Tucker. However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal, rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee and the legislature threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against Tucker. Huckabee was then duly sworn in as governor.\n\nIn November 1998, Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney Bill Bristow in the general election, becoming the state's third elected Republican governor since Reconstruction.\nAccording to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee received 48% of the African American vote in his 1998 election; but some experts have questioned whether those numbers are a representative sample on how he did on the whole in the election.\n\nIn November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his second four-year term by defeating State Treasurer Jimmie Lou Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote. His reelection came despite the defeat in the general election of fellow Republican U.S. Senator Tim Hutchinson.\n\nHuckabee received widespread praise for his state's rapid response to Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, \"Time\" named him one of the five best governors in the U.S., writing \"Huckabee has approached his state's troubles with energy and innovation\" and referred to him as \"a mature, consensus-building conservative who earns praise from fellow Evangelicals and, occasionally, liberal Democrats.\" \"Governing\" magazine likewise honored Huckabee as one of its 2005 Public Officials of the Year.\n\nBy the end of his term, Huckabee held the third-longest tenure of any Arkansas governor. Only Democrats Orval Faubus, who served six consecutive two-year terms (1955–1967), and Bill Clinton, who served 11 years, 11 months (1979–1981; 1983–1992), had longer tenures.\n\nDuring his time as a governor Huckabee supported a net tax increase of $505 million. According to columnist Margaret Carlson, that money was used to improve roads, health care, and schools in the state.\n\nAs governor, Huckabee commuted and accepted recommendations for pardon for twice as many sentences as his three predecessors combined; in total: 1,033 prisoners. Twelve had previously been convicted of murder. Though Huckabee pardoned more than his predecessors, the state prison size and number of people executed were greater as well, and Huckabee denied 92% of all clemency requests during his 10.5 years as governor. Most pardons and commutations were not for prisoners but those whose sentences had ended and were seeking work. Huckabee's pardons and commutations became an issue during the 2008 Republican Primary, with most of the controversy focusing on Wayne Dumond.\n\nHuckabee's handling of clemency petitions received national attention in November 2009 with the case of Maurice Clemmons, who had committed burglary without a weapon at age 16. The Prison Transfer Board unanimously requested a sentence commutation for Clemmons as did the trial judge. Clemmons's 60-year sentence was commuted by Huckabee to 47 years, making him eligible for parole if approved by the parole board. After parole in 2000, Clemmons was arrested for multiple offenses including child molestation and aggravated assault but was released after prosecutors declined to file charges. After Clemmons murdered four police officers in Lakewood, Washington, a two-day manhunt ensued, and Clemmons was shot and killed by a Seattle Police Department officer after refusing police orders to stop charging the officer. In his book about the shooting, \"The Other Side of Mercy\", Jonathan Martin of \"The Seattle Times\" wrote that Huckabee apparently failed to review Clemmons's prison file, which was \"thick with acts of violence and absent indications of rehabilitation\". Huckabee defended his actions, stating that the recommendation to reduce the sentence was unanimous and supported by the trial judge, that the decision to parole him was made by the parole board, not him, and that Clemmons had been re-arrested and the decision not to file charges then had nothing to do with him.\n\nIn 2003, Eugene Fields received a six-year prison sentence after his fourth conviction of driving while intoxicated in five years. Huckabee granted clemency over the objections of the local prosecutor and sheriff, the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. A spokeswoman for Huckabee, Charmaine Yoest, said that Fields's political donations [to the Arkansas Republican Party] and connections played no role in his clemency. About two years after Fields's sentence was cut to 11 months, he was arrested again for driving while intoxicated as his truck crossed the center line directly into the path of an oncoming police car.\n\nHuckabee announced his run for the White House on \"Meet the Press\" on January 28, 2007.\n\nAt the August 11 Iowa Straw Poll, Huckabee took second place with 2,587 votes, roughly 18 percent, splitting the conservative Republican party votes amongst other candidates. Huckabee spent $57.98 per vote in the Straw Poll, which is the lowest among the top three finishers. Huckabee drew attention with an unconventional ad featuring Chuck Norris. In a later ad Huckabee wished voters a merry Christmas, and said that \"what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ.\"\n\nIn November 2007, Huckabee drew endorsements from a large number of religious activists, including Billy McCormack, a pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana, and a director and vice president of the Christian Coalition of America, founded in 1988 by a previous presidential candidate, Pat Robertson. He was criticized for using a bookshelf that resembled a cross in a Christmas commercial as a form of signaling to Christians, and laughed them off saying \"I will confess this: If you play the spot backwards, it says, 'Paul is dead. Paul is dead.'\" He also faced a \"drumbeat\" of questions about the role of faith in his gubernatorial administration and about past statements he made in 1998 about the U.S. being a \"Christian nation\" in which he said, \"I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ.\" Huckabee told NBC that his comment was not politically incorrect and was \"appropriate to be said to a gathering of Southern Baptists\". Huckabee has credited God with some of his political success.\n\nOn January 3, 2008, Huckabee won the Iowa Republican caucuses, receiving 34% of the electorate and 17 delegates, compared with the 25% of Mitt Romney, who finished second, receiving 12 delegates; Fred Thompson, who came in third place and received three delegates; John McCain, who came in fourth place and received three delegates; and Ron Paul, who came in fifth place and received two delegates.\nOn January 8, 2008, Huckabee finished in third place in the New Hampshire primary, behind John McCain in first place, and Mitt Romney who finished second, with Huckabee receiving one more delegate for a total of 18 delegates, gained via elections, and 21 total delegates, versus 30 total (24 via elections) for Romney, and 10 for McCain (all via elections).\n\nOn January 15, 2008, Huckabee finished in third place in the Michigan Republican primary, 2008, behind John McCain in second place; Mitt Romney, who finished first; and ahead of Ron Paul, who finished in fourth place.\nOn January 19, 2008, Huckabee finished in second place in the South Carolina Republican primary, 2008, behind John McCain, who finished first and ahead of Fred Thompson, who finished third.\n\nOn January 29, 2008, Huckabee finished in fourth place in the Florida primary, behind Rudy Giuliani in third, Mitt Romney in second, and John McCain in first place.\n\nOn January 21, 2008, Huckabee received the endorsement of 50 African American leaders in Atlanta, Georgia. The endorsers cited Huckabee's record on life, education, minorities, the economy, the prison system, and immigration as Arkansas governor. Bu, NBC claimed that the endorsement of African American leaders at the Atlanta event was 36, and \"most of them connected to conservative religious organizations\".\n\nOn February 5, 2008, Huckabee won the first contest of \"Super Tuesday\", the West Virginia GOP state convention, but only after the McCain campaign provided their delegates, thereby giving Huckabee 52% of the electorate to Mitt Romney's 47%. Backers of rival John McCain said they threw Huckabee their support to prevent Mitt Romney from capturing the winner-take-all GOP state convention vote. Consequently, he also registered victories in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee on Super Tuesday, bringing his delegate count up to 156, compared with 689 for Republican party front-runner John McCain.\nOn February 9, 2008, Huckabee won the first election following Super Tuesday, by winning 60% of the vote in the Kansas Republican Caucuses.\nThis was also the first contest to be held without Mitt Romney, who was said to be splitting the conservative vote with Huckabee. Huckabee also won the Louisiana Republican Primary with 44% of the vote to John McCain's 43% in second. Although Huckabee won the primary he was not awarded any delegates, because of state party rules that stated a candidate must pass the 50% threshold to receive the state's pledged delegates.\n\nOn March 4, 2008, Huckabee withdrew from seeking the candidacy as it became apparent he would lose in Texas, where he had hoped to win, and that John McCain would get the 1,191 delegates required to win the Republican nomination. Huckabee finished the race with 240 pledged delegates.\n\nEven though Huckabee had signed a television contract and a book deal with a pressing deadline, he was mentioned by most to be on then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain's short list for his vice presidential running mate. The late pundit Tim Russert even referred to Huckabee as \"Vice President Huckabee\" several times when he appeared on \"Meet The Press\" on May 18, 2008. Huckabee was eventually passed over for Sarah Palin.\n\nFormer president Bill Clinton has praised Huckabee and stated that he is a rising star in the Republican Party. Clinton and Huckabee have collaborated on initiatives such as the fight against childhood obesity. Former Tennessee Republican Party chairman and Huckabee's former campaign manager Chip Saltsman has called Governor Huckabee, \"The most successful failed presidential candidate in the history of our country\".\n\nIn a November 19, 2008, article by the Associated Press, Huckabee addressed the possibility of running for president in 2012. He said, \"I'm not ruling anything out for the future, but I'm not making any specific plans.\"\n\nAmid speculation about a future run for the Presidency, a CNN poll in December 2008 found Huckabee at the top of the list of 2012 GOP contenders, along with former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, fellow 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.\n\nOn December 3, 2008, Cincinnati-based NBC affiliate WLWT asked Huckabee about the prospect of running, to which he said, \"I'm pretty sure I'll be out there. Whether it's for myself or somebody else I may decide will be a better standard bearer, that remains to be seen.\"\n\nA June 2009 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation national poll showed Huckabee as the 2012 presidential co-favorite of the Republican electorate along with Palin and Romney. An October 2009 poll of Republicans by Rasmussen Reports put Huckabee in the lead with 29%, followed by Romney on 24% and Palin on 18%. In a November 2009 Gallup poll, Huckabee was shown as the leading Republican contender for 2012. In November 2010 CNN projected in a poll that Huckabee would defeat Barack Obama in a hypothetical 2012 contest. In a Rasmussen poll taken January 11–14, 2011, Huckabee was even with Obama at 43% each.\n\nHuckabee took stances opposed to the nature of the incumbent president, Barack Obama. In comments made March 1, 2011, on \"The Steve Malzberg Show\", Huckabee said of Obama, \"I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American.\" (This is a reference to the Mau Mau Uprising against the colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1952; Obama himself has never lived in Kenya.)\n\nOn May 14, 2011, Huckabee announced on his FNC show that he would not be a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. Despite his high national poll numbers and being seen by many as the front runner, Huckabee declined to run, saying, \"All the factors say 'go,' but my heart says 'no.'\"\n\nPolitical commentators speculated that Huckabee might be ready for another presidential run in 2016. He was limited by a lack of money in 2008 but with changes to federal election law allowing SuperPACs to pour large sums of money into a race he might be better positioned to stay in the race. Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows. He ended his daily radio show in December 2013, which strengthened speculations about a presidential bid.\n\nHuckabee indicated in September 2014 that he would make the decision on whether to run early in 2015. In January 2015, Huckabee ended his show on FNC to prepare for his possible run in the 2016 presidential election. On March 30, 2015, Huckabee supporters launched a Super PAC to make preparations for his run for the Presidential ticket in 2016.\n\nOn May 5, 2015, Huckabee announced a campaign to seek the Republican nomination for president of the United States in the 2016 election. In his speech, which was delivered in the hometown that he shares with Bill Clinton, Huckabee attacked trade deals that he said drive down U.S. wages, opposed raising the age for Social Security benefits, criticized President Obama for what he said was putting more pressure on Israel than Iran, and made an unusual plea for donations of $15 or $25 a month, saying: \"I will ask you to give something in the name of your children and grandchildren.\"\nOn October 13, 2015, making reference to the ongoing Democratic Party primary competition, he posted a comment on Twitter saying, \"I trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust a North Korean chef with my labrador! #DemDebate\".\n\nOn December 14, 2015, Alice Stewart, the head spokesman for the campaign, resigned her position. She was replaced immediately by Hogan Gidley, the former director of HuckPac.\n\nOn February 1, 2016, after a disappointing showing in the Iowa caucus Huckabee decided that he was going to suspend his campaign.\n\nReports emerged in the summer of 2016 that Huckabee, who currently lives in Florida, was considering running for governor of Florida in 2018 to succeed term limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott. However, Huckabee later announced that he was declining to run in the 2018 Florida Gubernatorial election. Had he run and won, he would have become the first person to serve as governor of two separate states since Sam Houston, who served as governor of Tennessee and later as governor of Texas. Before his announcement not to run, an August 2016 poll of Florida Republicans conducted by StPetePolls.org showed Huckabee leading a field of potential Republican gubernatorial candidates with 37%.\n\nFollowing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Huckabee met with president-elect of the United States Donald Trump, whom he had supported for the Republican nomination after ending his own campaign in February. It was reported by \"The Daily Mail\" and \"The Jerusalem Post\" that Trump offered Huckabee the position of United States Ambassador to Israel. Huckabee denied the reports. He told Fox News that a possible cabinet appointment for himself was discussed but that he turned the offer down, saying, \"I'm not sure it was the right fit.\"\n\nHis daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders is White House press secretary to President Donald Trump since July 2017.\n\nIn January 2018, Huckabee praised Doha, Qatar as being \"surprisingly beautiful, modern, and hospitable\" after a trip there, but did not reveal that a foreign agent for Qatar had paid $50,000 to a corporation run by Huckabee as a \"honorarium for visit\".\n\nHuckabee opposes any public funding for abortion, and believes that abortion should be legal only when the life of the mother is at risk. He believes that it would \"most certainly\" be a good day for America if \"Roe v. Wade\" were reversed.\n\nHuckabee opposed Obama's health care plan, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He stated that he wants to \"give citizens more control over their own health care choices\".\n\nIn his book \"From Hope to Higher Ground\", Huckabee expressed support for free trade, but only if it is \"fair trade.\" He identified excess litigation, excess taxation, and excess regulation as three factors contributing to the loss of American jobs, and has proposed economic sanctions on China.\n\nAccording to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee won 48% of African American votes in his successful 1998 gubernatorial race in Arkansas. The 48% figure is often disputed due to the exit poll's small sample size. Huckabee says that it is important for Republicans such as himself to reach out to black voters, and in 2015 he has ramped up efforts to win those votes.\n\nIn 2015, Huckabee stated on \"Meet the Press\" that the confederate flag issue was for South Carolinians to decide, \"not an issue for a person running for president\", and days later he congratulated Gov. Nikki Haley on her decision supporting removal of the flag from the state capitol. Huckabee gave a speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention that included this: \"I say with sincerity that I have great respect for Senator Obama's historic achievement to become his party's nominee—not because of his color, but with indifference to it. Party or politics aside, we celebrate this milestone because it elevates our country.\"\n\nHuckabee believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, and he opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions. He outlawed gay marriage in Arkansas, but in 2007 he stated that Americans should \"respect\" gay couples. He says that adoptions should be child focused and opposes gay adoptions.\n\nIn January 2015, he was quoted comparing homosexuality to \"drinking and swearing.\"\n\nIn comments made March 4, 2011, on the \"Michael Medved Show\", Huckabee spoke about pregnant, unwed actress Natalie Portman, saying \"it's unfortunate we glorify and glamorize the idea of out of wedlock children.\"\n\nIn January 2014, in a luncheon speech at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, in response to a federal mandate on contraception, Huckabee stated that \"Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government.\"\n\nHuckabee has voiced his support of intelligent design and he has stated that he does not accept the validity of Darwin's theory of evolution. He was quoted in July 2004 on \"Arkansans Ask\", his regular show on the Arkansas Educational Television Network: \"I think that students also should be given exposure to the theories not only of evolution but to the basis of those who believe in creationism.\"\n\nIn April 2011, Huckabee said, \"I almost wish that there would be a simultaneous telecast and all Americans would be forced, at gunpoint, to listen to every David Barton message,\" in praise of the Christian revisionist historian David Barton.\n\nWithin hours of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Huckabee made headlines in the U.S. and abroad for stating on Fox News: \"We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we have systematically removed God from our schools,\" and further asked, \"Should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage?\"\n\nIn September 2014, Huckabee said, \"Fire the ones who refuse to hear not only our hearts, but God's heart\" (for which he was criticized by Richard Dawkins).\n\nIn September 2015, speaking about his support on religious freedom grounds of Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to radio host Michael Medved, Huckabee said, \"Michael, \"Dred Scott\" decision of 1857 still remains to this day the law of the land which says that black people aren't fully human. Does anybody still follow the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision?\" (The decision in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" had been superseded by the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and nullified by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.)\n\nIn June 2016, Huckabee, along with actor Pat Boone and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film \"God's Not Dead 2\", sent a letter to California governor Jerry Brown opposing Senate Bill 1146, which \"prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination\" at California colleges. Other than religious schools—those that train pastors and theology teachers—schools \"might no longer be allowed to hire Christian-only staff, teach religious ideas in regular classes, require attendance at chapel services or keep bathrooms and dormitories restricted to either males or females.\"\n\nIn 2007, Huckabee argued for a larger military and an increase in defense spending, writing, \"Right now, we spend about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense, compared with about six percent in 1986, under President Ronald Reagan. We need to return to that six percent level.\"\n\nDuring his bid for president, Huckabee released a comprehensive nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. His plan includes building a border fence, increased border patrol personnel, and increases in visas for skilled workers who enter the country legally. He has previously stated he is opposed to using military resources for border patrol. Huckabee's plan would also require all 11-12 million illegal immigrants to register with the federal government and return to their home countries within 120 days. Failure to do so would carry a 10-year ban from entering the US.\n\nHuckabee has voiced his support for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has generally taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed. He has said that whenever he hears people start talking about hunting when referring to the Second Amendment, he realizes they do not know what they are talking about, because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.\n\nAs governor of Arkansas, Huckabee received grades of B in 1998, C in 2000, C in 2002, D in 2004, and F in 2006 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.\n\nHuckabee received two honorary doctoral degrees: a Doctor of Humane Letters, received from John Brown University in 1991, and a Doctor of Laws from Ouachita Baptist University in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, Huckabee was named \"Friend of a Taxpayer\" by Americans for Tax Reform for his cut in statewide spending.\n\nIn 2005, Huckabee was named one of \"Time\"s top 5 governors, honored as one of \"Governing\" magazine's Public Officials of the Year, and given the American Public Health Association's Distinguished Public Health Legislator of the Year Award. In 2006, he was presented with AARP's Impact Award.\n\nIn 2007, Huckabee was given the Music for Life Award by the National Association of Music Merchants for his music education advocacy.\n\nIn December 2008, Huckabee became an Honorary Member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.\n\nIn July 2010, Huckabee became a fundraiser on behalf of for-profit Victory College in Memphis, Tennessee, and was designated Chancellor of the Victory University Foundation.\n\nHuckabee was made the chair of the Southern Governors' Association in 1999 and served in capacity through 2000. He has chaired the Southern Growth Policies Board, the Southern Regional Education Board, the Southern Technology Council, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, and the Education Commission of the States. He is also a member of the Republican Governors Association and former chairman of the National Governors Association. Huckabee is presently the chairman of conservative PACs called the Vertical Politics Institute and Huck PAC.\n\nHuckabee co-hosted Troopathon 2013.\n\nOn June 12, 2008, Fox News announced it was hiring Huckabee as a political commentator and regular contributor to their 2008 American presidential election coverage, in their New York election headquarters.\n\nHuckabee filled in for Paul Harvey in July 2008. A few months later, he signed a deal with ABC Radio Networks (now Cumulus Media Networks) to carry a daily commentary, \"The Huckabee Report\", beginning in January 2009. After Harvey's death his show replaced Harvey's broadcasts. On April 15, 2015, Huckabee announced that \"The Huckabee Report\" would be ending May 1, but subscribers could hear similar content that they would pay for.\n\nHuckabee hosted a weekend show, \"Huckabee\", on Fox News Channel, which premiered Saturday, September 27, 2008, at 8 PM EST, and ended on January 3, 2015 so that Huckabee could consider the possibility of running for president.\n\nOn April 2, 2012, Huckabee launched a long-form daily talk show on Cumulus Media Networks, who provide the call-in guests. The show, which is targeted at second-tier broadcast stations, features long-form interviews and discussions and airs in the noon to 3 p.m. time slot, directly opposite the market leader in talk radio, \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\". On November 27, 2013, Huckabee announced that the show will have its final broadcast on December 12, 2013, stating that he and Cumulus Media mutually decided not to renew the contract.\n\nIn a December 2013 interview, Huckabee stated that he would be launching a news organization in partnership with Christian Media Corp. International.\n\nHuckabee launched a show on Trinity Broadcasting Network in 2017.\n\nHuckabee plays the electric bass guitar in his classic-rock cover band, Capitol Offense. The group has played for political events and parties, including entertaining at unofficial inaugural balls in Washington, D.C., in January 2001.\nWhen elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was obese. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with type 2 diabetes, and informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135 kg). Coupled with the death of former Governor Frank D. White (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50 kg). \"The New York Times\" called the weight loss so rapid that \"it was as if he simply unzipped a fat suit and stepped out.\"\n\nAlthough Huckabee has stated that he never smoked nor drank, he declared himself a \"recovering foodaholic\". Huckabee has publicly recounted his previous burdens as an obese man: the steps of the Arkansas capitol from the entrance of the building up to the Governor's office were so long and steep that he would be out of breath and exhausted by the time he reached the top of the stairs. Huckabee has discussed his weight loss and used health care reform as a major focus of his governorship.\n\nAt an August 2007 forum on cancer hosted by Lance Armstrong, Huckabee said he would support a federal smoking ban, but has stated that he believes the issue is best addressed by state and local governments.\n\nHuckabee has completed several marathons: the 2005 Marine Corps Marathon, the 2005 and 2006 Little Rock Marathon, and the 2006 New York City Marathon. The 2005 Little Rock Marathon featured an impromptu challenge between Huckabee and Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack. Huckabee completed the marathon in 4:38:31, defeating Vilsack by 50 minutes. He wrote a book chronicling his weight-loss experience, \"Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork\". Huckabee was one of 10 recipients of a 2006 AARP Impact Award acknowledging his work as a \"health crusader\".\n\nIn 2009, Huckabee acknowledged that he had gained back a fourth of his weight due to a foot condition that prevented him from running.\n\nHuckabee has written or co-authored several books including \"Do The Right Thing: Inside the Movement That's Bringing Common Sense Back to America\" (released on November 18, 2008) which became a \"New York Times\" Best Seller, \"Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork\" and \"God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "815920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=815920", "title": "Natan Sharansky", "text": "Natan Sharansky\n\nNatan Sharansky (, , ; born Anatoly Borisovich Shcharansky (, ) on 20 January 1948) is an Israeli politician, human rights activist and author who, as a refusenik in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s, spent nine years in Soviet prisons. He has served as Chairman of the Executive of the Jewish Agency since June 2009, to be replaced in August 2018 by Isaac Herzog.\n\nSharansky was born in Donetsk (then called Stalino), Soviet Union on 20 January 1948 to a Jewish family. He graduated with a degree in applied mathematics from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. As a child, he was a chess prodigy. He performed in simultaneous and blindfold displays, usually against adults. At the age of 15, he won the championship in his native Donetsk. When incarcerated in solitary confinement, he claims to have maintained his sanity by playing chess against himself in his mind. Sharansky beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a simultaneous exhibition in Israel in 1996.\n\nHe took his current Hebrew name in 1986, when he was freed from Soviet incarceration as part of a prisoner exchange and received an Israeli passport with his new name.\n\nNatan Sharansky is married to Avital Sharansky and has two daughters, Rachel and Hannah. In the Soviet Union, his application to marry Avital was denied by the authorities. They were married in a friend's apartment, in a ceremony not recognized by the government, as the USSR only recognized civil marriage and not religious marriage.\n\nSharansky was denied an exit visa to Israel in 1973. The reason given for denial of the visa was that he had been given access, at some point in his career, to information vital to Soviet national security and could not now be allowed to leave. After becoming a refusenik, Sharansky became a human rights activist, working as a translator for dissident and nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov, and spokesman for the Moscow Helsinki Group and a leader for the rights of refuseniks.\n\nOn 15 March 1977 Sharansky was arrested on multiple charges including high treason and spying for Americans. The accusation stipulated that he passed to the West lists of over 1,300 \"refuseniks\", many of whom were denied exit visas because of their knowledge of state secrets, which resulted in a publication by Robert C. Toth, \"Russ Indirectly Reveal 'State Secrets': Clues in Denials of Jewish Visas\". High treason carried the death penalty. The following year, in 1978, he was sentenced to 13 years of forced labor.\n\nSharansky spent time in the Lefortovo Prison in Moscow, followed by Vladimir and Chistopol prisons, where for part of the time he was placed in solitary confinement. His health deteriorated, to the point of endangering his life. Later he was detained in Perm 35, a post-Stalin-Gulag-type so-called \"strict regimen colony\" in Perm Oblast. He kept himself sane during solitary confinement by playing chess with himself, in his head.\n\nSharansky appeared in a March 1990 edition of \"National Geographic\" magazine. The article, \"Last Days of the Gulag\" by Mike Edwards, profiles through photographs and text one of the few remaining Soviet prison labor camps. The article featured a photo of Natan Sharansky and his wife Avital in their home in Israel viewing photos of the same Gulag where he had been imprisoned, but as it appeared in 1990. Sharansky remarked in the article that after viewing images of the prisoner's faces he could discern that the protocol of oppression was still at work. The author also showed Sharansky a photo of the cold isolation cell where he had himself been confined. Sharansky commented with irony that conditions had improved slightly—the stark cell now featured a thin bench bolted to the middle of the floor. He said that if that bench had existed when he was there he could have utilized it to sleep, albeit uncomfortably.\n\nAs a result of an international campaign led by his wife, Avital Sharansky (including assistance from East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel, New York Congressman Benjamin Gilman and Rabbi Ronald Greenwald), Sharansky was released on 11 February 1986 as part of a larger exchange of detainees. He was the first political prisoner released by Mikhail Gorbachev due to intense political pressure from Ronald Reagan.\n\nSharansky and three low-level Western spies (Czech citizen Jaroslav Javorský and West German citizens Wolf-Georg Frohn and Dietrich Nistroy) were exchanged for Czech spies Karl Koecher and Hana Koecher held in the United States, Soviet spy Yevgeni Zemlyakov, Polish spy Marian Zacharski and East German spy Detlef Scharfenorth (the latter three held in West Germany). The exchange took place on the Glienicke Bridge between East and West Berlin, which had been used before for this purpose.\n\nSharansky immediately immigrated to Israel, adopting the Hebrew name \"Natan\" and eventually simplifying his surname to Sharansky. His wife had become religiously observant during his detention, but he did not follow her on this path.\n\nDue to his age and poor health, he was exempted from the standard mandatory three years' military service, but had to undergo three weeks of military training and do a stint in the Civil Guard.\n\nIn 1988, he wrote \"Fear No Evil\", his memoirs of his time as a prisoner, and founded the Zionist Forum, an organization of Soviet immigrant Jewish activists dedicated to helping new Israelis and educating the public about integration issues, known in Israel as \"klita\" (lit. \"absorption\"). Sharansky also served as a contributing editor to \"The Jerusalem Report\" and as a Board member of Peace Watch.\n\nIn 1986, the United States Congress granted him the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\nIn 1987, the Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America granted Sharansky the \"Henrietta Szold Award\", given by Ruth Popkin.\n\nIn 2006, US President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nOn 17 September 2008, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation awarded Sharansky its 2008 Ronald Reagan Freedom Award.\n\nIn 1995, Sharansky and Yoel Edelstein founded the Yisrael BaAliyah party (a play of words, since \"aliya\" means both Jewish emigration to Israel, and \"rise\", thus the party name means \"(People of) Israel immigrating (to the State of Israel)\", as well as \"Israel on the rise\"), promoting the absorption of the Soviet Jews into Israeli society. The party won seven Knesset seats in 1996. It won 6 seats in the Israeli legislative election, 1999, gaining two ministerial posts, but left the government on 11 July 2000 in response to suggestions that Prime Minister Ehud Barak's negotiations with the Palestinians would result in a division of Jerusalem. After Ariel Sharon won a special election for Prime Minister in 2001, the party joined his new government, and was again given two ministerial posts.\n\nIn the January 2003 elections, the party was reduced to just two seats. Sharansky resigned from the Knesset, and was replaced by Edelstein. However, he remained party chairman, and decided to merge it into Likud (which had won the election with 38 seats). The merger went through on 10 March 2003, and Sharansky was appointed Minister of Jerusalem Affairs.\n\nFrom March 2003 – May 2005, he was Israel's Minister without Portfolio, responsible for Jerusalem, social and Jewish diaspora affairs. Under this position Sharansky chaired a secret committee that approved the confiscation of East Jerusalem property of West Bank Palestinians. This decision was reversed after an outcry from the Israeli left and the international community.\n\nPreviously he served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Israel, Minister of Housing and Construction since March 2001, Interior Minister of Israel (July 1999 – resigned in July 2000), Minister of Industry and Trade (1996–1999).\n\nHe resigned from the cabinet in April 2005 to protest plans to withdraw Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank.\n\nHe was re-elected to the Knesset in March 2006 as a member of the Likud Party. On 20 November 2006, he resigned from the Knesset.\n\nHis resignation was meant to allow him to form the right-leaning Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies. The funding came from American billionaire Sheldon Adelson.\n\nSince 2007, Sharansky has been Chairman of the Board of Beit Hatefutsot, the Jewish diaspora museum.\n\nIn June 2009, Sharansky was elected to the Chair of the Executive of the Jewish Agency for Israel by the Jewish Agency Board of Governors. In September 2009 Sharansky secured $6 million from the Genesis Philanthropy Group for educational activities in the former Soviet Union.\n\nHe is a Founding Member of One Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1997, Sharansky was the focus of a 2.5-hour-long episode of \"Chaim SheKa'ele\" (\"What A Life\"), the Israeli version of \"This Is Your Life\". The episode focused mainly on his experiences as a Soviet dissident, and featured many of his family and acquaintances. In 2005, Sharansky participated in \"They Chose Freedom\", a four-part television documentary on the history of the Soviet dissident movement, and in 2008 he was featured in Laura Bialis' documentary \"Refusenik\". In 2014, he took part in Natella Boltyanskaya's documentary \"Parallels, Events, People\". He was number eleven on the list of \"Time\" magazine's 100 most influential people of 2005 in the \"Scientists and thinkers\" category.\n\nSharansky is the author of three books. The first is the autobiographical \"Fear No Evil\", which dealt with his trial and imprisonment.\n\nHis second book, \"The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror\" was co-written with Ron Dermer. George W. Bush offered praise for the book:\nIf you want a glimpse of how I think about foreign policy, read Natan Sharansky's book, \"The Case for Democracy\". ... For government, particularly – for opinion makers, I would put it on your recommended reading list. It's short and it's good. This guy is a heroic figure, as you know. It's a great book.\n\nHis book \"Defending Identity: Its Indispensable Role in Protecting Democracy\", is a defense of the value of national and religious identity in building democracy.\n\nSharansky has argued that there can never be peace between Israel and the Palestinians until there is \"the building of real democratic institutions in the fledgling Palestinian society, no matter how tempting a 'solution' without them may be.\" In a \"Haaretz\" interview, he maintained the following:\n\nJews came here 3,000 years ago and this is the cradle of Jewish civilization. Jews are the only people in history who kept their loyalty to their identity and their land throughout the 2,000 years of exile, and no doubt that they have the right to have their place among nations—not only historically but also geographically. As to the Palestinians, who are the descendants of those Arabs who migrated in the last 200 years, they have the right, if they want, to have their own state ... but not at the expense of the state of Israel.\n\nIn the wake of the Arab uprisings of 2011, he told \"Moment Magazine\", \"To sign an agreement you must have a partner who is dependent on the well-being of his people, which is what democracy means.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36768", "title": "Pope Gregory I", "text": "Pope Gregory I\n\nPope Gregory I (; – 12 March 604), commonly known as Saint Gregory the Great, was Pope of the Catholic Church from 3 September 590 to 12 March 604 AD. He is famous for instigating the first recorded large-scale mission from Rome, the Gregorian Mission, to convert the then-pagan Anglo-Saxons in England to Christianity. Gregory is also well known for his writings, which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as Pope. The epithet Saint Gregory the Dialogist has been attached to him in Eastern Christianity because of his \"Dialogues\". English translations of Eastern texts sometimes list him as Gregory \"Dialogos\", or the Anglo-Latinate equivalent \"Dialogus\".\n\nA Roman senator's son and himself the Prefect of Rome at 30, Gregory tried the monastery but soon returned to active public life, ending his life and the century as pope. Although he was the first pope from a monastic background, his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator, who successfully established papal supremacy. During his papacy, he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of Rome, and he successfully challenged the theological views of Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople before the emperor Tiberius II. Gregory regained papal authority in Spain and France and sent missionaries to England. The realignment of barbarian allegiance to Rome from their Arian Christian alliances shaped medieval Europe. Gregory saw Franks, Lombards, and Visigoths align with Rome in religion. He also combated against the Donatist heresy, popular particularly in North Africa at the time.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, he was known as \"the Father of Christian Worship\" because of his exceptional efforts in revising the Roman worship of his day. His contributions to the development of the Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, still in use in the Byzantine Rite, were so significant that he is generally recognized as its \"de facto\" author.\n\nGregory is a Doctor of the Church and one of the Latin Fathers. He is considered a saint in the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Anglican Communion, and some Lutheran denominations. Immediately after his death, Gregory was canonized by popular acclaim. The Protestant reformer John Calvin admired Gregory greatly, and declared in his \"Institutes\" that Gregory was the last good Pope. He is the patron saint of musicians, singers, students, and teachers.\n\nThe exact date of Gregory's birth is uncertain, but is usually estimated to be around the year 540, in the city of Rome. His parents named him \"Gregorius\", which according to Ælfric of Abingdon in \"An Homily on the Birth-Day of S. Gregory,\" \"... is a Greek Name [sic], which signifies in the Latin Tongue, \"Vigilantius\", that is in English, Watchful...\" The medieval writer who provided this etymology did not hesitate to apply it to the life of Gregory. Aelfric states, \"He was very diligent in God's Commandments.\"\n\nGregory was born into a wealthy patrician Roman family with close connections to the church. His father, Gordianus, who served as a senator and for a time was the Prefect of the City of Rome, also held the position of Regionarius in the church, though nothing further is known about that position. Gregory's mother, Silvia, was well-born, and had a married sister, Pateria, in Sicily. His mother and two paternal aunts are honored by Catholic and Orthodox churches as saints. Gregory's great-great-grandfather had been Pope Felix III, the nominee of the Gothic king, Theodoric. Gregory's election to the throne of St Peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period.\n\nThe family owned and resided in a \"villa suburbana\" on the Caelian Hill, fronting the same street (now the Via di San Gregorio) as the former palaces of the Roman emperors on the Palatine Hill opposite. The north of the street runs into the Colosseum; the south, the Circus Maximus. In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned. Villas covered the area. Gregory's family also owned working estates in Sicily and around Rome. Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by John the Deacon. Gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes. He wore a beard. Silvia was tall, had a round face, blue eyes and a cheerful look. They had another son whose name and fate are unknown.\n\nGregory was born into a period of upheaval in Italy. From 542 the so-called Plague of Justinian swept through the provinces of the empire, including Italy. The plague caused famine, panic, and sometimes rioting. In some parts of the country, over 1/3 of the population was wiped out or destroyed, with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the Empire. Politically, although the Western Roman Empire had long since vanished in favour of the Gothic kings of Italy, during the 540s Italy was gradually retaken from the Goths by Justinian I, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire ruling from Constantinople. As the fighting was mainly in the north, the young Gregory probably saw little of it. Totila sacked and vacated Rome in 546, destroying most of its population, but in 549 he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets. It has been hypothesized that young Gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their Sicilian estates, to return in 549. The war was over in Rome by 552, and a subsequent invasion of the Franks was defeated in 554. After that, there was peace in Italy, and the appearance of restoration, except that the central government now resided in Constantinople.\n\nLike most young men of his position in Roman society, Saint Gregory was well educated, learning grammar, rhetoric, the sciences, literature, and law, and excelling in all. Gregory of Tours reported that \"in grammar, dialectic and rhetoric ... he was second to none...\" He wrote correct Latin but did not read or write Greek. He knew Latin authors, natural science, history, mathematics and music and had such a \"fluency with imperial law\" that he may have trained in it \"as a preparation for a career in public life.\" Indeed, he became a government official, advancing quickly in rank to become, like his father, Prefect of Rome, the highest civil office in the city, when only thirty-three years old.\n\nThe monks of the Monastery of St. Andrew, established by Gregory at the ancestral home on the Caelian, had a portrait of him made after his death, which John the Deacon also saw in the 9th century. He reports the picture of a man who was \"rather bald\" and had a \"tawny\" beard like his father's and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mother's and father's. The hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled. His nose was \"thin and straight\" and \"slightly aquiline.\" \"His forehead was high.\" He had thick, \"subdivided\" lips and a chin \"of a comely prominence\" and \"beautiful hands.\"\n\nIn the modern era, Gregory is often depicted as a man at the border, poised between the Roman and Germanic worlds, between East and West, and above all, perhaps, between the ancient and medieval epochs.\n\nOn his father's death, Gregory converted his family \"villa\" into a monastery dedicated to the apostle Saint Andrew (after his death it was rededicated as San Gregorio Magno al Celio). In his life of contemplation, Gregory concluded that \"in that silence of the heart, while we keep watch within through contemplation, we are as if asleep to all things that are without.\".\n\nIt seems to some that Gregory was not always forgiving, or pleasant for that matter, even in his monastic years. For example, a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces. Gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone, then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse, \"Take your money with you to perdition\". Gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin, even on one's deathbed. However, at the monk's death Gregory offered 30 Masses in his remembrance to assist his soul before the final judgment. Eventually, Pope Pelagius II ordained Gregory a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the Three Chapters in northern Italy. However, this schism was not healed until well after Gregory was gone.\n\nGregory had a deep respect for the monastic life. He viewed being a monk as the 'ardent quest for the vision of our Creator.' His three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity. However, after the two eldest died after seeing a vision of their ancestor Pope Felix III, the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate. Gregory's response to this family scandal was \"many are called but few are chosen.\" Gregory's mother Silvia herself is a saint.\n\nIn 579, Pelagius II chose Gregory as his \"apocrisiarius\" (ambassador to the imperial court in Constantinople), a post Gregory would hold until 586. Gregory was part of the Roman delegation (both lay and clerical) that arrived in Constantinople in 578 to ask the emperor for military aid against the Lombards. With the Byzantine military focused on the East, these entreaties proved unsuccessful; in 584, Pelagius II wrote to Gregory as \"apocrisiarius\", detailing the hardships that Rome was experiencing under the Lombards and asking him to ask Emperor Maurice to send a relief force. Maurice, however, had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the Lombards to intrigue and diplomacy, pitting the Franks against them. It soon became obvious to Gregory that the Byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force, given their more immediate difficulties with the Persians in the East and the Avars and Slavs to the North.\n\nAccording to Ekonomou, \"if Gregory's principal task was to plead Rome's cause before the emperor, there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward Italy became evident. Papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether\". Gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of John III Scholasticus, who had occupied the Patriarchate of Constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of Eutychius (who had been driven out by Justinian). Gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the Byzantine elite of the city, where he became extremely popular with the city's upper class, \"especially aristocratic women\". Ekonomou surmises that \"while Gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of Constantinople's aristocracy, this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of Rome before the emperor\". Although the writings of John the Deacon claim that Gregory \"labored diligently for the relief of Italy\", there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of Pelagius II.\n\nGregory's theological disputes with Patriarch Eutychius would leave a \"bitter taste for the theological speculation of the East\" with Gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy. According to Western sources, Gregory's very public debate with Eutychius culminated in an exchange before Tiberius II where Gregory cited a biblical passage (\"\"Palpate et videte, quia spiritus carnem et ossa non-habet, sicut me videtis habere\", or \"touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.\") in support of the view that Christ was corporeal and palpable after his Resurrection; allegedly as a result of this exchange, Tiberius II ordered Eutychius's writings burned. Ekonomou views this argument, though exaggerated in Western sources, as Gregory's \"one achievement of an otherwise fruitless \"apokrisiariat\"\". In reality, Gregory was forced to rely on Scripture because he could not read the untranslated Greek authoritative works. \nGregory left Constantinople for Rome in 585, returning to his monastery on the Caelian Hill. Gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed Pelagius II in 590, when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city. Gregory was approved by an Imperial \"iussio\" from Constantinople the following September (as was the norm during the Byzantine Papacy).\n\nIn Constantinople, Gregory took issue with the aged Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople, who had recently published a treatise, now lost, on the General Resurrection. Eutychius maintained that the resurrected body \"will be more subtle than air, and no longer palpable\". Gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen Christ in . As the dispute could not be settled, the Byzantine emperor, Tiberius II Constantine, undertook to arbitrate. He decided in favor of palpability and ordered Eutychius' book to be burned. Shortly after both Gregory and Eutychius became ill; Gregory recovered, but Eutychius died on 5 April 582, at age 70. On his deathbed Eutychius recanted impalpability and Gregory dropped the matter. Tiberius also died a few months after Eutychius.\n\nAlthough Gregory was resolved to retire into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation, he was unwillingly forced back into a world that, although he loved, he no longer wanted to be a part of. In texts of all genres, especially those produced in his first year as pope, Gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of\nprayer he had once enjoyed as a monk.\nWhen he became pope in 590, among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of Peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks. At that time, for various reasons, the Holy See had not exerted effective leadership in the West since the pontificate of Gelasius I. The episcopacy in Gaul was drawn from the great territorial families, and identified with them: the parochial horizon of Gregory's contemporary, Gregory of Tours, may be considered typical; in Visigothic Spain the bishops had little contact with Rome; in Italy the territories which had \"de facto\" fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent Lombard dukes and the rivalry of the Byzantines in the Exarchate of Ravenna and in the south.\n\nPope Gregory had strong convictions on missions: \"Almighty God places good men in authority that He may impart through them the gifts of His mercy to their subjects. And this we find to be the case with the British over whom you have been appointed to rule, that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also.\" He is credited with re-energizing the Church's missionary work among the non-Christian peoples of northern Europe. He is most famous for sending a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, under Augustine of Canterbury, prior of Saint Andrew's, where he had perhaps succeeded Gregory, to evangelize the pagan Anglo-Saxons of England. It seems that the pope had never forgotten the English slaves whom he had once seen in the Roman Forum. The mission was successful, and it was from England that missionaries later set out for the Netherlands and Germany. The preaching of non-heretical Christian faith and the\nelimination of all deviations from it was a key element in Gregory's worldview, and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate.\n\nAccording to the Gilbert Huddleston, he was declared a saint immediately after his death by \"popular acclamation\".\n\nIn his official documents, Gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term \"Servant of the Servants of God\" (\"servus servorum Dei\") as a papal title, thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes.\n\nAlms in Christianity is defined by passages of the New Testament such as Matthew 19:21, which commands \"...go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor ... and come and follow me.\" A donation on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise, profit or non-profit.\n\nOn the one hand the alms of Saint Gregory are to be distinguished from his donations, but on the other he himself probably saw no such distinction. The church had no interest in secular profit and as pope Gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel. Apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms.\n\nGregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at Rome. They were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the Lombards. The philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward. He received lavish donations from the wealthy families of Rome, who, following his own example, were eager, by doing so, to expiate their sins. He gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse. He wrote in letters:\n\nThe church received donations of many different kinds of property: consumables such as food and clothing; investment property: real estate and works of art; and capital goods, or revenue-generating property, such as the Sicilian latifundia, or agricultural estates, staffed and operated by slaves, donated by Gregory and his family. The church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor: associated with each parish was a \"diaconium\" or office of the deacon. He was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance.\n\nThe state in which Gregory became pope in 590 was a ruined one. The Lombards held the better part of Italy. Their predations had brought the economy to a standstill. They camped nearly at the gates of Rome. The city was packed with refugees from all walks of life, who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life. The seat of government was far from Rome in Constantinople, which appeared unable to undertake the relief of Italy. The pope had sent emissaries, including Gregory, asking for assistance, to no avail.\n\nIn 590, Gregory could wait for Constantinople no longer. He organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief. In doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting, which was not to be invented for centuries. The church already had basic accounting documents: every expense was recorded in journals called \"regesta\", \"lists\" of amounts, recipients and circumstances. Revenue was recorded in \"polyptici\", \"books\". Many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets, the \"patrimonia\". A central papal administration, the \"notarii\", under a chief, the \"primicerius notariorum\", kept the ledgers and issued \"brevia patrimonii\", or lists of property for which each \"rector\" was responsible.\n\nGregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not. In a letter to a subordinate in Sicily he wrote: \"I asked you most of all to take care of the poor. And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out ... I desire that you give the woman, Pateria, forty solidi for the children's shoes and forty bushels of grain ...\" Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble.\n\nMoney, however, was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine. Even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas. The church now owned between of revenue-generating farmland divided into large sections called \"patrimonia.\" It produced goods of all kinds, which were sold, but Gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to Rome for distribution in the \"diaconia\". He gave orders to step up production, set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out. At the bottom was the \"rusticus\" who produced the goods. Some rustici were or owned slaves. He turned over part of his produce to a \"conductor\" from whom he leased the land. The latter reported to an \"actionarius\", the latter to a \"defensor\" and the latter to a \"rector\". Grain, wine, cheese, meat, fish and oil began to arrive at Rome in large quantities, where it was given away for nothing as alms.\n\nDistributions to qualified persons were monthly. However, a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.\n\nThese and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the Roman people. They now looked to the papacy for government, ignoring the rump state at Constantinople, which had only disrespect for Gregory, calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the Lombards. The office of urban prefect went without candidates. From the time of Gregory the Great to the rise of Italian nationalism the papacy was most influential presence in Italy.\n\nJohn the Deacon wrote that Pope Gregory I made a general revision of the liturgy of the Pre-Tridentine Mass, \"removing many things, changing a few, adding some\". In letters, Gregory remarks that he moved the \"Pater Noster\" (Our Father) to immediately after the Roman Canon and immediately before the Fraction. This position is still maintained today in the Roman Liturgy. The pre-Gregorian position is evident in the Ambrosian Rite. Gregory added material to the \"Hanc Igitur\" of the Roman Canon and established the nine \"Kyries\" (a vestigial remnant of the litany which was originally at that place) at the beginning of Mass. He also reduced the role of deacons in the Roman Liturgy.\n\nSacramentaries directly influenced by Gregorian reforms are referred to as \"Sacrementaria Gregoriana\". Roman and other Western liturgies since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season; these variations are visible in the collects and prefaces as well as in the Roman Canon itself.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches, Gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, a fully separate form of the Divine Liturgy in the Byzantine Rite adapted to the needs of the season of Great Lent. Its Roman Rite equivalent is the Mass of the Presanctified used only on Good Friday. The Syriac Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts continues to be used in the Malankara Rite, a variant of the West Syrian Rite historically practiced in the Malankara Church of India, and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the Assyrian Church of the East.\n\nThe mainstream form of Western plainchant, standardized in the late 9th century, was attributed to Pope Gregory I and so took the name of Gregorian chant. The earliest such attribution is in John the Deacon's 873 biography of Gregory, almost three centuries after the pope's death, and the chant that bears his name \"is the result of the fusion of Roman and Frankish elements which took place in the Franco-German empire under Pepin, Charlemagne and their successors\".\n\nGregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him.\nGregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive \"corpus\". Some of his writings are:\n\nGregory wrote over 850 letters in the last 13 years of his life (590–604) that give us an accurate picture of his work. A truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for Gregory. The development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature.\n\nOpinions of the writings of Gregory vary. \"His character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one,\" the Jewish Canadian-American popularist Cantor observed. \"On the one hand he was an able and determined administrator, a skilled and clever diplomat, a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision; but on the other hand, he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous monk, hostile to learning, crudely limited as a theologian, and excessively devoted to saints, miracles, and relics\".\n\nGregory was among those who identified Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany, whom recounts as having anointed Jesus with precious ointment, an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of Jesus performed by a woman that Luke (alone among the synoptic Gospels) recounts as sinful. Preaching on the passage in the Gospel of Luke, Gregory remarked: \"This woman, whom Luke calls a sinner and John calls Mary, I think is the Mary from whom Mark reports that seven demons were cast out.\" Today Biblical scholars distinguish the three figures, but they are all still popularly identified.\n\nIn art Gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross, despite his actual habit of dress. Earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress. Orthodox icons traditionally show St. Gregory vested as a bishop holding a Gospel Book and blessing with his right hand. It is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo, then used for the living. A dove is his attribute, from the well-known story attributed to his friend Peter the Deacon, who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on Ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself. As, however, the pope remained silent for long periods at a time, the servant made a hole in the curtain and, looking through, beheld a dove seated upon Gregory's head with its beak between his lips. When the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words; but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips.\nRibera's oil painting of \"Saint Gregory the Great\" (c.1614) is from the Giustiniani collection. The painting is conserved in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome. The face of Gregory is a caricature of the features described by John the Deacon: total baldness, outthrust chin, beak-like nose, whereas John had described partial baldness, a mildly protruding chin, slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks. In this picture also Gregory has his monastic back on the world, which the real Gregory, despite his reclusive intent, was seldom allowed to have.\n\nThis scene is shown as a version of the traditional Evangelist portrait (where the Evangelists' symbols are also sometimes shown dictating) from the tenth century onwards. An early example is the dedication miniature from an eleventh-century manuscript of Saint Gregory's \"Moralia in Job\". The miniature shows the scribe, Bebo of Seeon Abbey, presenting the manuscript to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry II. In the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration. Usually the dove is shown whispering in Gregory's ear for a clearer composition.\n\nThe late medieval subject of the Mass of St Gregory shows a version of a 7th-century story that was elaborated in later hagiography. Gregory is shown saying Mass when Christ as the Man of Sorrows appears on the altar. The subject was most common in the 15th and 16th centuries, and reflected growing emphasis on the Real Presence, and after the Protestant Reformation was an assertion of the doctrine against Protestant theology.\n\n\nThe relics of Saint Gregory are enshrined in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nIn Britain, appreciation for Gregory remained strong even after his death, with him being called \"Gregorius noster\" (\"our Gregory\") by the British. It was in Britain, at a monastery in Whitby, that the first full length life of Gregory was written, in c. 713. Appreciation of Gregory in Rome and Italy itself, however, did not come until later. The first \"vita\" of Gregory written in Italy was not produced until John the Deacon in the 9th century.\n\nThe namesake church of San Gregorio al Celio (largely rebuilt from the original edifices during the 17th and\n18th centuries) remembers his work. One of the three oratories annexed, the oratory of Saint Silvia, is said to lie over the tomb of Gregory's mother.\n\nIn England, Gregory, along with Augustine of Canterbury, is revered as the apostle of the land and the source of the nation's conversion.\n\nItalian composer Ottorino Respighi composed a piece named \"St. Gregory the Great\" \"(San Gregorio Magno)\" that features as the fourth and final part of his Church Windows (\"Vetrate di Chiesa\") works, written in 1925.\n\nThe current General Roman Calendar, revised in 1969 as instructed by the Second Vatican Council, celebrates Saint Gregory the Great on 3 September. Before that, it assigned his feast day to 12 March, the day of his death in 604. Following the imposition of Pope John XXIII's Code of Rubrics in 1961, celebration of Saint Gregory's feast day was made practically impossible, as John XXIII's reforms forbade the full observance of most feasts during Lent, during which 12 March invariably falls. For this reason, Saint Gregory's feast day was moved to 3 September, the day of his episcopal consecration in 590, as part of the liturgical reforms of Pope Paul VI.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite continue to commemorate Saint Gregory on 12 March which is during Great Lent, the only time when the Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, which names Saint Gregory as its author, is used.\n\nOther churches also honour Saint Gregory: the Church of England and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod on 3 September, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada on 12 March.\n\nA traditional procession is held in Żejtun, Malta, in honour of Saint Gregory (San Girgor) on Easter Wednesday, which most often falls in April, the range of possible dates being 25 March to 28 April.\nThe feast day of Saint Gregory also serves as a commemorative day for the former pupils of Downside School, called Old Gregorians. Traditionally, OG ties are worn by all of the society's members on this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55122058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55122058", "title": "Richard Plunkett (beadle)", "text": "Richard Plunkett (beadle)\n\nRichard Plunkett (1788-1832) was a Parish Officer of the Law, variously described as a headborough, beadle or night-constable, in Whitechapel, in the East End of London, between 1817 and 1826. His duties were centred upon the Whitechapel watch-house, from which he and his watchmen had to deal with nocturnal criminality in an area of rapidly increasing population, crowded conditions with poor sanitation, and much urban poverty and squalor. Plunkett's term of office just preceded the Metropolitan Police Act 1829, by which a new system of policing was introduced. Plunkett was often called upon to give evidence at the Old Bailey, the cases being scheduled for hearings two or three times a year. His testimony and that of his officers in these more serious cases show his relations with the population at large, his investigations, pursuits and arrests, often based on personal knowledge of the offenders. The majority of these cases resulted in convictions leading to penal transportation. His work illustrates the real activities of the parish police of Whitechapel just over a decade before the writing of \"Oliver Twist\". \n\nRichard Plunkett was born, lived and died in Whitechapel. He was a son of Luke Plunkett and Margaret Read, who were married at Christ Church, Spitalfields in January 1772. From various different homes in the neighbourhood, Luke and Margaret christened their children at St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel between 1776 (as of Bell Yard) and 1790 (as of Rosemary Lane, now Royal Mint Street). Richard was christened in April 1788 as of George Yard in Gunthorpe Street.\n\nNot much is known about Richard's childhood, but in February 1808, at Christchurch Spitalfields, he married Ann Haffner, the middle of three daughters of Thomas Haffner and his wife Elizabeth Hunt. Haffner lived at No. 2 Union Court, Fashion Street, and Richard Plunkett and his wife lived at No. 3 soon after their marriage. Fashion Street was just north of Keate Street and Thrawl Street, between Brick Lane and Commercial Street. Plunkett was at that time clerk of a benefit society based at the Black Dog Inn in Church Street, Bethnal Green, under management of Mr Stokes: Haffner, a member of the society, made Plunkett sole executor of his will (dividing his property between his three daughters), proved in June 1811. Richard and Ann had four children, Richard James (1810), William (1812), Ann (1815) and Caroline (1817), all of whom were christened at St Mary's and survived infancy. Between 1812 and 1817 they were resident in Fieldgate Street, south of the Whitechapel Road.\n\nIn the same period his sister Mary had her own family. She married William Crowder, a stationer-bookbinder of Stepney, at Christ Church Spitalfields in May 1810, and their first two daughters were christened from an address on London Wall. The next two, Elizabeth (1815) and Sarah (1817), were christened at St Mary Whitechapel as from Fieldgate Street; later children were christened at the newly-rebuilt St Dunstan-in-the-East, as from Mile End Old Town, or from Ratcliff. All lived to be married.\n\n1817 seems to mark the completion of Richard's family-making intentions for the time being, and his first appearance as 'constable of the night' at the Old Bailey relates to an incident just a month before his youngest daughter's christening. As he stood at the corner of Whitechapel church a 19-year-old man ran past an unemployed servant-girl and snatched the shawl (value 2 shillings) from her shoulders. Plunkett took him in charge, and the miscreant got 7 years' transportation.\n\nAs keeper of the watch-house Plunkett received whatever prisoners the watchmen brought in, and a charge of grand larceny, with the same sentence, was successfully laid against Robert Miles the following April, when apprehended by two watchmen with a quantity of linen stolen from a carrier's wagon. A month later Plunkett made his own arrest of a carpenter's lad carrying home a plank of wood from his workplace at 3.30 a.m. Searching the house, Plunkett found two doors which he had also taken. Here a verdict of Not Guilty was returned, the master having made no complaint.\n\nBut in September 1818, following the wholesale theft of provisions (casks of butter and honey and a sackful of hams) from a warehouse in Goodman's Fields (an area around Leman Street and Alie Street), Plunkett, having taken one of the thieves prisoner, got information and went to his residence, where he recovered the goods from the man's wife and mother. About the same time a 15-year-old boy who had stolen a tablecloth and 11 shillings in copper coins from his master, proprietor of an eating-house in Wentworth Street, was made by his father to give himself up to Plunkett. Both criminals were transported for 7 years.\n\nIn a classic sting two years later, a young woman invited a printer of Coleman Street, who frequented Whitechapel, back to her house. When he had got into bed and put his pocket watch under the pillow, she extinguished the light and ran off, and two people came in and ordered him out of the house. Missing his watch the man made Plunkett arrest the girl, but nothing was found. In court Plunkett said he thought the complainant was drunk, and remarked that the man had accused him of stealing a pound from him when held in charge two nights previously for drunkenness. The girl was found Not Guilty.\n\nBy contrast, in November 1820, a man was invited in by a girl in George Yard, Wentworth Street: once he had paid her something to fetch gin, first the women and then the men of the house robbed his money and possessions and forcibly ejected him, padlocking the door. The man called an officer, who arrested one of the girls (aged 17). Further complaint was made to Plunkett, who (having been born in George Yard) knew the man responsible and arrested him. Both were transported for life.\n\nSoon afterwards, on 16 January 1821, Plunkett faced a personal challenge. Now living at No. 5 Baker's Row (on the north side of Whitechapel High Street, just east of the Workhouse: now Vallance Road), his two sons usually closed the outer shutters of the windows on their return from school, but were delayed. Soon after 5 pm, while taking tea in his back room, he heard a noise and found that two men had broken into his house via the front window, and were moving about in the dark. Discovered, one jumped onto a table and out through the upper part of the sash. The other followed, his gaiter slipping from Plunkett's grasp. But Plunkett jumped after him, caught him, and gave him into charge of George Brock, who was standing by. \n\nHe then chased the other, whom he recognised, up Baker's Row and round the corner into Church Street, where the man appeared nonchalantly in the doorway of a public house. A fight ensued, and Plunkett took him. The two were found guilty of burglary and sentenced to death, but a special verdict was returned pending a decision as to whether the window had been secured. (This case established that the pulling down of the sash of a window, though unfastened, constituted a breaking within the definition of \"breaking and entering\".) William Haynes and William Harrison were transported for life on the second convict voyage of the \"Asia\" on 1 April 1822.\n\nMary Crowder, Plunkett's sister, also found herself in the Old Bailey in the winter of 1820-21. She was still living at Greenfield Street, and in mid-February her lodger, who had been with her since mid-December, disappeared owing her 24 shillings. Some spoons and a pair of ear-rings went missing at the same time. She had not threatened to arrest him for the money owing: the apparent theft came to court, but was not proved against the defendant.\n\nIn June 1821 Plunkett testified in two cases of pocket-picking, one of which had taken him back to George Yard. In September two women who had accosted a man walking home at 2 a.m. and had taken 27 shillings from him were sentenced to transportation for life. A year later Plunkett and his colleague John Clark went after two women known to them who were accused of stealing a coat and 35 sovereigns from a retired excise-officer in the street, but although the coat was found the court had doubt of their guilt. On the same day he gave evidence in a case of street robbery (classed as highway robbery with violence, though the work of a footpad) which led to a death sentence. Between December 1822 (when on one occasion he held an identification parade) and February 1825 Plunkett testified in nine other serious cases, mostly resulting in transportation.\n\nIt happened that near to his house in Baker's Row stood the premises of Messrs. Brocks Fireworks factory. On 4 September 1825 two boys were engaged in ramming gunpowder into squibs when a spark ignited and the boys ran out in fright, throwing the firework aside. Fifty pounds of gunpowder and a large amount of saltpetre suddenly exploded, blowing the roof off, setting fire to the building, and smashing every pane of glass in most of the adjoining streets. \"Females were frightened into hysterics\" (runs the report), but the only serious injury was to Richard Plunkett's sister.\n\nIn November 1825 a respectable lady, Mrs Byrne, stopped at a house in Leman Street and remonstrated with the owner, an undertaker, who was beating his wife. The man then produced a constable's baton and had Mrs Byrne sent to the watch-house as a common prostitute. Plunkett kept her there for two hours among some rough company, and was about to lock her in a cell when her husband and brother arrived to rescue her. She was vindicated in court, severe criticism was levelled against the watch-houses, and the wife-beating constable was arrested and charged.\n\nIn the same week a respectable-looking young man was found lying drunk on Whitechapel Road. The watchman took him to the watch-house to sleep it off, but when Plunkett looked in on him at about 4 a.m. he found him weltering in blood, having stabbed himself in the neck with a penknife. With immediate attention he was able to explain that he wished to end his life, and when further recovered was sent home in a cab under medical supervision.\n\nThese events doubtless contributed to Plunkett's retirement as beadle, and the evidence he gave leading to two further convictions in 1826 are his last recorded in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey. At the time of the firework explosion his occupation is given as \"writing ink maker\", and in that capacity he took out insurance in December 1825. By March 1827 he had become the publican of the Green Man in Castle Street, Whitechapel. He was buried as from Castle Street at St Mary's Whitechapel on 10 June 1832, aged 44, perhaps a victim of the cholera epidemic. At her marriage in 1838 his daughter Ann recorded her late father's occupation as \"publican\".\n"}

Through this foundation, he was able to generate enough funds to establish the Thomas Aquinas Research Complex that houses today the various research centers in the university as well as the Graduate School. To strengthen and expand the community outreach programs of the university, he established the Office for Community Development which later evolved into the UST SIMBAHAYAN, the umbrella project for all university outreach programs focused on five K's: Karunungan (Knowledge transfer), Kalusugan (Medical missions), Kabuhayan (livelihood projects), Kanlungan (housing projects for the poor and those affected by natural disasters), and Kapayapaan (peace education for communities torn by religious and other conflicts.\n\nAs Rector, he became president of the Association of Catholic Universities of the Philippines and a two-time President of the ICUSTA International Council of Universities of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with Epic Records in 1983. The band then released the album \"Diamond Life\" a year later, which became one of the best selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist. It also gained widespread critical acclaim and is largely considered one of the best albums of all-time.\n\nSoon after, they released \"Promise\" (1985), which was also a resounding critical and commercial success, becoming the band's first album to debut atop the \"Billboard\" 200. It later earned quadruple platinum certification in the U.S., and reached platinum across Europe. It also earned the group the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1986. Their following two releases, 1988's \"Stronger Than Pride\" and 1992's \"Love Deluxe\", were also critically and commercially successful; however, the band would go on hiatus after the birth of Sade's son, Andes the singer would experience widespread media coverage during the period for unsubstantiated claims of mental health and addiction issues.\n\nAfter a spell of eight years without an album, which came after Sade appeared in the film \"Absolute Beginners\" (1986), the band reunited in 1999, and released \"Lovers Rock\" in 2000. The album departed from the jazz-inspired inflections of their previous work, featuring more mellow sounds and pop compositions, and was critically praised, earning the group the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. The band would then undergo another term of hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of \"Soldier of Love\". The album was another commercial success, although critical reception remained divided, but won the group the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Following the album's release, the band entered a third period of hiatus, and have only released one new song (2018's \"Flower of The Universe\" for the soundtrack of Disney's \"A Wrinkle In Time.\") to date.\n\nSade is widely considered a musical influence, and her contributions to music have made her a global figure in popular culture for over two decades. She has been credited as one of the most successful British female artists in history, and her work is listed among the finest in modern jazz history. Her services to music were also commemorated after being awarded the Officer of the Order of the British Empire chivalry honour in 2002.\n\nHelen Folasade Adu was born on 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Her middle name, Folasade, means \"honour confers a crown\". Her parents are Adebisi Adu, a Nigerian lecturer in economics of Yoruba background, and Anne Hayes, an English district nurse; they met in London, married in 1955, and moved to Nigeria. When Sade was four years old, her parents separated. Anne Hayes then returned to England, taking Sade and older brother Banji with her to live with their grandparents near Colchester, Essex. When Sade was 11 years old, she moved to Holland-on-Sea, Essex, to live with her mother. After completing her education at Clacton County High School at age 18, she moved to London and studied fashion design at Saint Martin's School of Art.\n\nAfter completing a three-year course work in fashion design, and later modeling briefly, Sade began backup singing with British band Pride. During this time, she formed a songwriting partnership with Pride's guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman; together, backed by Pride's rhythm section, they began doing their own sets at Pride gigs. Her solo performances of the song \"Smooth Operator\" attracted the attention of record companies, and in 1983 Sade and Matthewman split from Pride, along with keyboardist Andrew Hale, bassist Paul Denman and drummer Paul Cook, to form the band Sade. By the time she performed her first show at London's Heaven nightclub, she had become so popular that 1,000 people were turned away at the door. In May 1983, Sade performed their first US show at the Danceteria nightclub in New York City. On 18 October 1983, Sade Adu signed with Epic Records, while the rest of the band signed in 1984.\n\nFollowing the record deal, the group began recording their debut album, \"Diamond Life,\" which took six weeks to record and was recorded entirely at The Power Plant in London. \"Diamond Life\" was released on 16 July 1984, reached number two in the UK Album Chart, sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK, and won the Brit Award for Best British Album in 1985. The album was also a hit internationally, reaching number one in several countries and the top ten in the US, where it has sold in excess of four million copies. \"Diamond Life\" had international sales of over six million copies, becoming one of the top-selling debut recordings of the '80s, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist.\n\n\"Your Love Is King\" was released as the album's lead single on 25 February 1984 and was a success in European territories, charting at number seven in Ireland and number six on the UK Singles Chart. The song was less successful in the US, where it peaked at number 54 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The third single, \"Smooth Operator\", was released on 15 September 1984 and became the most successful song in the US from the album \"Diamond Life\". The track peaked at number five on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the US \"Billboard\" Hot Black Singles, as well as peaking at number one on the US \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart. In Europe the song fared well, peaking at number 19 in the UK, and reaching the top 20 in Austria, Switzerland, France and Germany.\n\nIn late 1985, the band released their second album, \"Promise\", which peaked at number one in both the UK and the US and became the band's first album to reach number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200. The album topped the chart in 1986 and spent two weeks at the peak position. Eventually, the album went on to sell four million copies in the region and was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned two singles \"Never as Good as the First Time\" and \"The Sweetest Taboo,\" the latter of which was released as the album's lead single and stayed on the US Hot 100 for six months. \"The Sweetest Taboo\" peaked at number five on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number one on the US adult Contemporary chart, and number three on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the '70s practice of playing album tracks, adding \"Is It a Crime\" and \"Tar Baby\" to their playlists. The following year, 1986, the band won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nIn 1986, Sade made her acting debut in \"Absolute Beginners\", a film adapted from the Colin MacInnes book of the same name about life in late-1950s London. Sade played the role of Athene Duncannon and lent her vocals to the film's accompanying soundtrack. The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival and grossed £1.8 million in the UK.\nSade's third album, \"Stronger Than Pride\", was released on 3 May 1988, and like Sade's previous album became a commercial success and certified three times platinum in the US. The album was popularized by four singles, most notably the album's second single \"Paradise\", which peaked at number 16 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and peaked at number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, becoming the band's first single to do so.\n\n\"Love Deluxe\" was released as the band's fourth studio album on 26 October 1992. The album peaked at number three on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and has sold 3.4 million copies in the United States. The album was later certified four times platinum by the RIAA for shipments of four million copies. The album was also commercially successful elsewhere, reaching number-one in France, and reaching the top ten in New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The album went on to be certified gold in the United Kingdom. In November 1994, the group released their first compilation album, \"The Best of Sade\". The album was another top ten hit in both the United Kingdom and the United States, certified platinum and four times platinum, respectively.\nThe compilation album included material from Sade's previous albums, as well as a cover version of \"Please Send Me Someone to Love\" (1950), originally by Percy Mayfield.\n\nFollowing an eight-year hiatus, the band released their fifth studio album, \"Lovers Rock\", on 13 November 2000 and received positive reviews from music critics.\nThe album reached number 18 on the UK Albums Chart, number three on the US \"Billboard\" 200, and has since been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold 3.9 million copies in the United States by February 2010. On 27 February 2002, the album earned Sade the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and the lead single \"By Your Side\" was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Although the single lost out to Nelly Furtado's \"I'm Like a Bird\", it has been listed as the 48th greatest love song of all time by VH1.\n\nTo promote the album, Sade and the band embarked on their fifth concert tour entitled Lovers Rock Tour. The tour was announced via the band's website in April 2001. The announcement stated the tour would begin in the summer of 2001 with 30 shows. Initial dates were rescheduled due to extended rehearsal time. The shows sold well, with many stops adding additional shows. In August 2001, the tour was extended by eight weeks due to ticket demand. Deemed by many critics as a comeback tour, it marked the band's first performances since 1994 and took place in 2001. Although many believed the trek would expand to other countries, this did not occur. With over 40 shows, it became the 13th biggest tour in North America, earning over 26 million.\n\nFollowing the tour, the band released their first live album, \"Lovers Live\" on 5 February 2002 by Epic Records. \"Lovers Live\" reached number ten on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and number 51 on the UK Albums Chart, the band's first album to miss the top twenty in the UK. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on 7 March 2002, having reached US sales of 562,000 copies, while the DVD was certified platinum on 30 January 2003 for shipping 100,000 copies.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Lovers Rock\", Sade took a ten-year hiatus, during which she raised her son and moved to the Caribbean. During this time, she made a rare public appearance for an award ceremony that took place in 2002 to accept an Order of the British Empire (OBE) at Buckingham Palace for services to music. In 2002, she appeared on the Red Hot Organization album, \"Red Hot + Riot\", a compilation CD in tribute to the music of fellow Nigerian musician, Fela Kuti. She recorded a remix of her hit single \"By Your Side\" for the album and was billed as a co-producer.\n\nThe band's sixth studio album, \"Soldier of Love\", was released worldwide on 8 February 2010 and was the most recent album in ten years to contain new material. Upon release, the album received positive reviews and became a success. The album debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States with first-week sales of 502,000 copies. \"Soldier of Love\" became the band's first album to debut at number-one and the band's second album to peak at number-one on the chart. The album also had the best sales week by a group since Australian band AC/DC released their album \"Black Ice\" and entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number-one in November 2008. Consequently, the band became the act with the longest hiatus between number-one albums, as the band's \"Promise\" (1985) and \"Soldier of Love\" were separated by 24 years, 10 months and 2 weeks.\n\nThe first single and title track, \"Soldier of Love\", premiered on US radio on 8 December 2009 and was released digitally on 11 January 2010. Subsequent singles, \"Babyfather\" and \"The Moon and the Sky\", were played by US urban adult contemporary radio on 13 April and 24 August 2010, respectively. At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2011, the title track won Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, while the song, \"Babyfather\", was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nIn April 2011, the band began their Sade Live tour (also known as the \"Once in a Lifetime Tour\" or the \"Soldier of Love Tour\"). The band toured Europe, the Americas, Australia and Asia to promote the band's sixth studio album and their second compilation album, \"The Ultimate Collection\" (2011). This trek marked the band's first tour in nearly a decade and ranked 27th in \"Pollstar's\" \"Top 50 Worldwide Tour (Mid-Year)\", earning over 20 million dollars. At the conclusion of 2011, the tour placed tenth on \"Billboard's\" annual \"Top 25 Tours\", earning over $50 million with 59 shows. The tour was chronicled with Bring Me Home - Live 2011, released in May, 2012.\n\nIn March 2018, she (and the reunited band that also bears her name) released the acoustic ballad \"Flower of the Universe\" for the soundtrack to the Disney film \"A Wrinkle In Time\". About asking Sade to contribute to the album, director Ava DuVernay wrote \"I never thought she'd say yes, but asked anyway.\" Later that year, Sade released \"The Big Unknown\" for the soundtrack to the 20th Century Fox film \"Widows\". That film's director, Steve McQueen stated that Sade agreed to write the song for the film, because \"the original series of \"Widows\" had deeply resonated with her.\" The successor to \"Soldier of Love\" is in the works.\n\n\"The New Yorker\" described Sade's voice as a \"grainy contralto full of air that betrays a slight ache but no agony, and values even imperfect dignity over a show of pain\", a \"deeply English\" quality that makes categorizing the artist's voice difficult. Her voice was described by the BBC as \"husky and restrained\" and compared to singer Billie Holiday. BBC called her songwriting \"sufficiently soulful and jazzy yet poppy, funky yet easy listening, to appeal to fans of all those genres.\" Sade has been called a \"pop star\". With the musicians in her band, Sade, \"The New Yorker\" wrote, \"created one of the most profitable catalogues in pop\"; the band's \"easy\" sound backing songs \"exploring the heavier lifting inside love: commitment, consistency, friendship.\" Her success has been attributed to a combination of her unique beauty, seemingly indefinable origins, and mysterious persona.\n\nSade's work has influenced and been recognized by many singers and hip hop artists. Rapper Rakim of Eric B. & Rakim stated he grew up listening to Sade's music and was influenced by her voice and style. Rakim has also referenced Sade's song \"Smooth Operator\" in his rap song \"Paid in Full\" (1987). Talib Kweli stated he learned about precision from Sade due to her performance of \"Love Deluxe\" in its entirety at Madison Square Garden. Rapper Missy Elliott cited Sade's performance of \"Smooth Operator\" as one of her favourites. Hip hop group Souls of Mischief stated they grew up listening to Sade's music. Hip hop group Tanya Morgan also described Sade as one of their favorite artists. Other rappers to recognize Sade include the former rap-duo of Clipse – Malice and Pusha. In reaction to the newly released album \"Soldier of Love\", rapper Kanye West wrote, \"This is why i still have a blog. To be a part of moments like this ... new Sade ... How much better this ... than everything else?\". Rapper Rick Ross stated in an interview that \"People may know my infatuation with Sade. There's never been a bad Sade track. I love all different sides.\"\n\nAmerican singer Beyoncé called Sade's music a \"true friend\" and an inspiration. The late singer Aaliyah said that she admired Sade because \"she stays true to her style no matter what... she's an amazing artist, an amazing performer... and I absolutely love her.\" American R&B singer Brandy has cited Sade as one of her major vocal influences. Kelly Rowland stated she is inspired by Sade Adu and says that \"she has a style that's totally her own.\"\n\nSade squatted in Wood Green, North London, in the 1980s, with her then-boyfriend writer Robert Elms. In 1989, she married film director Carlos Pliego. Their marriage ended in 1995. Sade moved briefly to the Caribbean to live with Jamaican music producer Bob Morgan in the late-1990s, but they later separated. During her relationship with Morgan, Sade gave birth to Mickailia, now known as Izaak, on 21 July 1996. Sade has been in a relationship with a former Royal Marine since 2007, and from this relationship she has a stepson. Morgan has nothing to do with their child. In 2016 on National Coming Out Day, Izaak came out as transgender and is no longer known as Mickailia.\n\nIn 2005, Sade moved to Gloucestershire. In the countryside where she bought a run-down cottage to renovate. Prior to the release of \"Soldier of Love\" in 2010, the \"Daily Mail\" described her as \"famously reclusive\". Sade rarely grants interviews.\n\nSade was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2002 for services to music, and stated her award was \"a great gesture to me and all black women in England\". She was promoted to Commander of the same Order (CBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours, also for services to music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemix albums, compilations and live albums\n"}

She is an advocate for restaurant workers in the (San Francisco) Bay Area and co-founder of the non-profit public service organization Restaurant Opportunities Centers United.\n\nBorn in 1975, Jayaraman was raised in a primarily Chicano neighborhood in Whittier, California. Her parents emigrated from India to the United States when her father was seeking work as a software engineer. They settled in the Los Angeles area, but Jayaraman's father lost his job when she was a teenager. She was made aware of her class and race at a young age. Her family frequently endured racial slurs and insults. One incident from her childhood occurred when many mechanics refused to service her family's car when it broke down while they were road tripping across Utah.\n\nJayaraman was accepted to Harvard at the age of sixteen, but her parents wanted her to stay close to home. Sixteen-year-old Jayaraman attended UCLA instead, where she earned her B.A. in International Development Studies and Political Science and graduated summa cum laude in 1995. She continued her education at Yale Law School and Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2000, Jayaraman was admitted to the State Bars in California and New York. During her time at Yale, Jayaraman studied under MacArthur Foundation Fellowship winner, Jennifer Gordon. Jayaraman was hired at Gordon's organization, the Workplace Project, where she dealt with training and organizing mistreated Latino immigrant workers to become their own advocates in instances of labor abuse.\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, thousands of workers from the World Trade Center were left jobless. The restaurant at the top of the World Trade was named Windows on the World. Jayaraman worked in partnership with Fekkak Mamdouh, the former chief server of Windows, to represent the displaced workers. The organization Jayaraman and Mamdouh founded together was named the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York. Although it was originally established to help those affected by 9/11, the ROC evolved and became an organizing center for all immigrant restaurant workers in New York. Jayaraman headed the expansion effort and became the co-founder and director of Restaurant Opportunities Center United in 2007. ROC United, still headed by Jayaraman and Mamdouh, currently has over 18,000 members across 15 states. The organization deals with workplace justice campaigns, establishing living wages, and protecting workers rights. Jayaraman has been a key player in major advancements for low wage workers across the country. ROC United has won back more than $10 million for its members, and is continuing to fight through the ONE FAIR WAGE Campaign. There are two federal minimum wages in the United States: $7.25 for untipped workers, and $2.13 for tipped workers. Jayaraman spearheads the fair wage campaign which seeks to eliminate this two tier system, and has already done so in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Montana, Minnesota and Alaska. ROC United was also instrumental in the passing of Washington's Accrued Sick and Safe Leave Act, which assures that all workers can begin accumulating sick leave after one day on the job.\n\nIn 1992, Saru Jayaraman started a non-profit called Women and Youth Supporting Each Other (W.Y.S.E) which \"empowers young women by providing the resources and support necessary to make positive life choices and create community change.\" She was recognized by President Bill Clinton during his commencement speech and was praised as \"America at its best.\" Jayaraman worked as a professor at various colleges in the New York area, teaching classes on a variety of topics, including political science, sociology, immigrants rights, and law. She also conducted research on food workers, sustainability, and urban poverty. Jayaraman has been serving as the leader of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley since 2012. It is the first academic institution to study the relationship between food and labor.\n\nJayaraman is married to Zachary Norris, and has two daughters named Akeela Lalitha and Lina Abiani Norris-Raman. Jayaraman and Norris met at a Rebelling Lawyers Conference. Norris is now the executive director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in San Francisco.\n\nSaru Jayaraman has written two books. \"The New Urban Immigrant Workforce\", released in 2005, is about modern methods of labor organizing. It draws on first hand accounts and ethnographies from workers in New York. \"Behind the Kitchen Door: The People Who Make and Serve Your Food\" was written in 2013. The book is about sexism, racism, and worker abuse in restaurants. After the best-selling book gained national attention, Jayaraman did television interviews on PBS, CNN, MSNBC, and HBO. In addition to her two books, Jayaraman has published numerous journal articles and technical reports.\n\nJayaraman was named a Champion of Change by the Obama administration in 2014, listed in CNN's \"Top10 Visionary Women,\" and was awarded a James Beard Foundation Leadership Award in 2015. She was named one of Crain's New York Business \"40 Under 40,\" 1010 Wins' \"Newsmaker of the Year,\" and New York Magazine's \"Influentials\" of New York City.\" In 2018 she was chosen by the National Women's History Project as one of its honorees for Women's History Month in the United States.\n\nOther accolades: \n\nShe attended the 75th Golden Globe Awards in 2018 as a guest of Amy Poehler.\n"}

The word is thought to have been derived from the Tamil word \"Etti\", a honorific title bestowed on the leading merchants in the Chola kingdom and Pandya Kingdom. \n\nMost of them trace their origin from Madurai, Tirunelveli and the Coromandel Coast of Southern India. They settled mostly in western and nort\nhern Sri Lanka, especially in the ports of Colombo, Jaffna and Galle from the 16th century to mid 17th century, during the rule of the Portuguese and Dutch. Some of the Chetties in Northern Sri Lanka were absorbed in other communities, mainly in the Sri Lankan Vellalar community, considered a subcaste known as \"Chetty Vellalar\" .\nThe Chetties of Western Sri Lanka converted to Roman Catholicism under Portuguese rule. Other converted to Anglicanism or Protestantism under Dutch rule and British rule. Intermarriage and alliances between Sinhalese and Chetties were not uncommon thus many also got Sinhalised.\n\nRepresentatives of the \"Colombo Chetty Association\" stressed out their distinctiveness, appealing for forming a separate ethnic group. The Chetties were notably also from 1814 to 1817 listed as a separate ethnic group.

He is president of both Maharishi University of Management (Holland) and Maharishi Open University.\n\nIn 2000, Nader received the title of First Sovereign Ruler of the conceptual country, Global Country of World Peace from Transcendental Meditation founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and in 2008, was named the Maharishi's successor. Nader published his second book, \"Ramayan In Human Physiology\" in 2011.

His post-doctoral work was as a clinical and research fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.\n\nNader has conducted research in hormonal activity, neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology, on the medical role of the neurotransmitter and on the relationship between age, behavior, diet, seasonal influences and mood. Nader reports that his desire to have a complete understanding of the mind and body and its relationship to consciousness and the human physiology, led him to a \"spiritual awakening\" and the study of Vedic Science with the Maharishi. Nader said he learned about \"the field of spiritual or non-physical, or non-material and how it expresses itself in the universe\" from the Maharishi. As a professor and director, Nader has conducted Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health programs and lectured in \"more than 50 countries\".\n\nIn 1986 Nader was criticized for overstating his post-graduate connections to MIT and implying that his research was sanctioned by his alma mater. In 1987, Nader worked at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts.\n\nIn his 1994 book \"Human Physiology: Expression of Veda and the Vedic Literature\", Nader postulated a one-to-one correlation of structure and function between 40 aspects of Vedic literature and 40 parts of human physiology. He also said he discovered similarities between the astrological influence of the planets and parts of the human brain. This body of work is reported to have been \"derived from\" the Maharishi's ideas, and Nader's own training in brain physiology. In May 1995, Nader was a keynote speaker at Maharishi University of Management and presented his \"recent discovery of how Natural Law manages the physiology, and the application of this knowledge to prevent and eliminate problems.\" The book has been described as an attempt at documenting the scientific basis of the Maharishi's \"interpretation of Advaita Vedanta and thus the Vedas … by relating neuroanatomy and neurophysiology to Vedic astrology and philosophy\".\n\nAccording to a press release, Nader was recognized for his \"scientific discovery\" in 1998, when he was awarded his weight in gold by Maharishi Vedic University of Holland, \"with the support of the Maharishi Global Development Fund\". The gold was reportedly given to Nader as a scientific award to support his continued research.\n\nNader performed the first research on Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology (MVVT), which aims \"to enliven the inner intelligence of the body and restore proper functioning\" through the use of Vedic sounds. Nader's studies were conducted in Berlin, Paris, and Valkenburg, testing the effectiveness of one session of MVVT in people with disorders that included arthritis, asthma, and gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nDuring a four-day Vedic ceremony in October 2000, Nader was honored by Maharishi as Maharaja (great king) Adhiraj Rajaraam and given responsibility for the Global Country of World Peace and, in 2008, became the Maharishi's successor. During these transitions, Nader was reportedly given various titles including \"Vishwa Prashasak Raja Raam\", \"Adhi Raam\", and \"Raja Nader Raam\". In 2002, Nader was invited by the mayor of Maharishi Vedic City to take residence at The Mansion Hotel, which serves as the capital of the conceptual Global Country of World Peace. In 2008, a spokesman said Nader would reign in silence and communicate through his governing council.\n\nNader published his second book, called \"Ramayan In Human Physiology\" in 2011, documenting the correlation between the characters, relationships, locations, and events of the Valmiki \"Ramayana\" with the structures and functions of human physiology. Nader says that his study does not conclude that the \"Ramayana\" belongs to any one religion or race or belief system. Rather, the \"Ramayana\" is the story of Natural Law and how it unfolds in every individual and the universe. In 2012, Nader was the keynote speaker on a tour of 10 cities in North American, entitled \"A New Paradigm: Veda, Consciousness, the Ramayana, and the Self\". His presentation in Chicago to 650 Indian Americans received a standing ovation. During the tour, Nader gave presentations on “Embodying Totality” and “Introductory Seminar on the Ramayan in Human Physiology\".\n\nNader in his book, \"Human Physiology-expression of Veda and the Vedic Literature\", postulated that the physical and material are aspects of Consciousness rather than Consciousness being an epiphenomenon of physical matter or a product of the brain and the nervous system. During his 2014 course, Hacking Consciousness, at Stanford University, he presented its mathematical framework. Subsequently, he describes with further mathematical detail his postulate that multiplicity including all matter arises from a primordial singularity of Consciousness through the spontaneous phenomenon of Consciousness actually exercising its basic nature of being conscious and thus knowing itself.\n\n\n"}

The character is a movie star whose personality traits and life events are taken from Morgan's own life. In the episode \"Grandmentor\", Jordan refers to himself as \"Tracy Morgan\". In 2010, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked him the 55th Greatest Character of the Last 20 Years.\n\nFor his portrayal of Jordan, Tracy Morgan has received one Primetime Emmy Award nomination, two Image Awards nominations, and seven Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one.\n\nTracy Jordan is a rich, famous B-list movie star with a reputation for unpredictable behavior. At the time newly installed NBC executive Jack Donaghy forces writer Liz Lemon to hire Jordan as the new star of her sketch comedy program \"The Girlie Show\" in the pilot episode of the series, Jordan was in a career slump, having made no new movies for two years. Upon hiring Tracy, Jack renames the show \"TGS with Tracy Jordan,\" much to the chagrin of Liz. Throughout the series, Jordan enjoys renewed success through his starring \"TGS\" role and other performances and ventures.\n\nJordan is a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and slave Sally Hemings. Jordan was born in Yankee Stadium but the exact date is unknown as he has no birth certificate. He was given the honorary birthday of February 24, shared with \"TGS\" Co-star Jenna Maroney in the March 5, 2009 episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\". Tracy grew up in a tough neighborhood in The Bronx, though many of his claims about it sound fictitious.\nAs a child, Jordan was a cast member on the Nickelodeon show \"Ray Ray's Mystery Garage\". He also claims to have attended middle school in an Exxon station. He lived with his single mother in 1979, dropped out of Frank Lucas High School over his inability to dissect a frog, and claims to have spent time busking as a bucket drummer. He was discovered after doing stand-up at the Apollo in 1984.\nJordan did a Christmas album in 1998 and is a big fan of Pat Benatar. In addition to his acting career, he writes a column in \"Ebony Magazine\" called \"Musings\". He owns several houses but got into debt because he didn't make the payments on them.\n\nJordan is a self-centered prima donna. For instance, in \"Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning\", Tracy says, \"Perfection is my middle name. 'Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy'.\" He aspires to own an island.\nJordan is treated for a mental health disorder by Dr. Leo Spaceman, a doctor of questionable integrity and qualification, who describes Tracy's problems as \"erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety and certainly not helped by my (Spaceman's) highly experimental treatments.\" He is unable to perform a scene the same way twice (\"Future Husband\"), making his employ as an actor difficult. Jordan is also a conspiracy theorist who believes, for instance, in shadow organizations and vampires. \nDespite all this, the character is supposed to be generally well-meaning and more intelligent than he appears. He periodically surprises his coworkers with his knowledge of proper grammar (for example, telling Toofer in \"The Aftermath\" that \"Superman does \"good\", you're doing \"well\"\") and advanced vocabulary, though these vignettes are often played for comedy. He is able to remember details of American history and is able to answer trivia questions correctly. He also has a sensitivity to the mistreatment of African Americans. Tracy has an interest in American Revolutionary history, which he studied after learning of his relation to Thomas Jefferson, attempting to produce and star in a Jefferson biopic. In \"Corporate Crush\", while struggling to secure funding for his film, he tells Liz \"You're my Alexander Hamilton!\" In \"Winter Madness\" he argues with several Freedom Trail historical reenactors in Boston for misrepresenting the racism of the Founding Fathers and the date of Crispus Attucks' death.\n\nJordan often implies that his clownish behavior is mostly an act, which he maintains because his childish persona is responsible for his success as an entertainer. This seems to be supported by Jordan's occasional moments of maturity, such as when he behaves professionally for an entire week in \"The Natural Order\" to prove to Liz Lemon that he is capable of acting like an adult. However, he soon reverts to his old personality, admitting he is more comfortable being immature.\n\nTracy and his wife Angie have been married since 1991. They like to roleplay, including 'playing rape', when he wears a ski mask. Jordan often walks around his house naked to show his oldest male child \"who got the biggest ding-dong\".\nWith Angie, Tracy has two sons, named Tracy Jordan Jr. and George Foreman Jordan (played by Dante E. Clark), and a daughter, Virginia, who is born during season 5. Tracy also has a self-styled illegitimate son named Donald (played by Michael Benjamin Washington), an entrepreneur whom Tracy supports financially despite knowing that he is not actually his son; Donald is two years older than Tracy.\n\nAlthough he \"parties with women to keep up his rap credentials,\" Tracy maintains loyalty to his wife, admitting to Jack Donaghy in \"The Ones\" that he has never cheated on her. Because his womanizing persona is integral to his success as an entertainer, Tracy's career takes a downturn in \"Don Geiss, America, and Hope\" when his monogamy becomes known to the public, in a reverse parody of the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal of 2009.\n\nTracy spent most of his childhood in foster care. He once lived with his birth mother, but lost touch with her: in \"The Moms\" he is not sure of her whereabouts or even her name. Tracy's biological father is unknown; Tracy presumes him dead since he has never come forward to ask Tracy for money. In \"Nothing Left to Lose,\" Tracy shares memories of a father who abandoned him for a second family in Ohio (going on to have a daughter who is also named Tracy), but the effect of this upon the show's continuity is unclear.\n\nTracy refers to Liz by either her last name or her full name, for example, \"Too late, Liz Lemon!\" Jordan treats Liz with contempt and mimics her. However, in later seasons he begins calling her \"LL\", following a trend of often calling characters by their initials.\n\nJordan tends to loiter around the studio with his entourage, former high school classmate Grizz and professional entourage member Dot Com. Jordan develops a close friendship with NBC page Kenneth Parcell, who willingly runs errands for him and periodically serves as a member of his entourage. Kenneth often puts himself in harm's way to help Jordan. Jordan helps Kenneth with his shyness around women, and considers himself a mentor to Kenneth. He is more sympathetic to Kenneth than most of the other characters are. For example, when Tracy quit TGS after learning he no longer needed the money he earned from the show, it was Jack's threat to fire Kenneth that made Tracy change his mind, returning to the show in order to keep Kenneth employed (\"The Bubble\"). Kenneth acted as an asexual, de facto, on-set wife to Jordan during his brief estrangement from Angie (Season 2).\n\nJordan and Jenna often disagree. For instance, whether it is more difficult to be a black man or a white woman in America (\"Believe in the Stars\"). However, they have some friendly moments at times and become closer, assuming they are both \"special people\". There is also an increasing occurrence of the two being involved in shenanigans together.\n\nJordan has a reputation for being uncontrollable and his habit of insulting powerful movie executives costs him roles. However, Jordan's engagements are many and varied.\n\nJordan is not overly interested in politics. Jack tried to recruit Jordan to join the Republican Party, but Jordan came to realize that African-Americans would never support the GOP. In 2007 Tracy's wife objects to him playing Barack Obama because, \"...we support [Dennis] Kucinich.\" In the 2008 US Presidential Election, Jordan voted for Ralph Nader.\n\nJordan is not religious. He once considers becoming Catholic but is dissuaded by Jack due to, as expected, intolerance of guilt. In \"The Ones,\" when Jordan arranges for Jack to come clubbing with him to see if Jack can remain faithful to his fiancée Elisa, Jordan compares the temptation to \"Jesus in the wilderness,\" before clarifying that Jesus is the name of a person he knows and \"the Wilderness\" is a club they'd attended. Jordan once wrote a novelty song entitled \"Werewolf Bar Mitzvah\", which he recorded for Geffen Records. The lyrics include \"Werewolf bar mitzvah, spooky, scary! Boys becoming men; men becoming wolves!\" He learns some Hebrew phrases. In the first episode of season 4 (entitled Season Four) of the show, it is revealed that Tracy may as well actually be Jewish. When asked about his disconnection to his roots, he said, \"Have I lost touch with my roots? I've gotta talk to Rabbi Shmuely (referring most likely to Shmuly Boteach) about this.\"\n\nDespite his personality difficulties, Jordan succeeds financially. For example, he makes $300 million by creating and marketing a pornographic video game, and then invests the profits in a company that dismantles bank signs during the financial crisis.\n\nIn Tina Fey's original pilot script for \"30 Rock\", Jordan was called \"Lawrence Jordan\".\n"}

He was the Deputy Project Manager of the Nimbus program and served as mission director for seven satellite launches. At the age of sixteen he had won the first Edison Scholarship Contest.\n\nHuston was born in Detroit, Michigan, the first child of the Reverend S. Arthur Huston, curate at St. Paul's Cathedral, and the former Dorothea J. Brotherton. His parents named him for Wilber Brotherton, his maternal grandfather, who was the manager of the Detroit operations of the Jerome B. Rice Seed Company. The \"Wilber\" spelling, instead of \"Wilbur\", derived from admiration for William Wilberforce, the English abolitionist. His maternal grandmother was Belle Brotherton, a leader in the women's suffrage movement.\n\nBetween 1913 and 1925 Huston, as a minister's son, lived in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Baltimore, Maryland, and San Antonio, Texas. In 1925, when his father was consecrated as Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia, his family settled in Seattle, Washington, and Huston enrolled at Lakeside School from which he graduated in 1929.\n\nEarly in 1929 Thomas Edison called a news conference to announce a national contest with the winner to receive an all-expenses-paid scholarship to the university of his choice. The governor of each state and the commissioners of the District of Columbia were to select a high school senior to represent their jurisdiction that August at Edison Laboratories in West Orange, New Jersey. Besides Edison, the judges would be Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone, George Eastman, Abrahamn De Mallie, Samuel Stratton, Lewis Perry (the principal of Phillips Exeter Academy), and Charles Lindbergh.\n\nHuston's maternal grandfather wrote to his father saying that the contest would be an excellent opportunity. Huston submitted a letter of application, his high school transcript, and three letters of recommendation. In due course Governor Roland H. Hartley announced that he had selected Huston and four others to travel to the state capital at their own expense for further screening. In Olympia the candidates took a written examination and submitted to interviews. After a caucus the examiners recommended that Huston represent Washington.\n\nIn August 1929 Huston was in West Orange, New Jersey, to compete for the Edison scholarship. He finished in a five-way tie for first place; the tie was broken by interviews with the judges.\n\nHuston entered Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall of 1929 and graduated in June 1933\nwith an S.B. degree in physics. \nFollowing graduation he accepted a position at Calibron, a small research company founded by Theodore Edison, the inventor's youngest son.\n\nIn the late 1930s Huston became interested in the Moral Re-Armament movement and left Calibron to accept a full-time position under Frank Buchman.\n\nAs a volunteer religious worker Huston was deferred from the draft until 1943. From that year until late 1944 he served in the United States Army Air Forces training bomber crews in celestial navigation before they went overseas.\n\nIn November 1944 the Army transferred Huston to the Civilian Reserve Corps at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he worked as an aeronautical research scientist for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Following his discharge he accepted a civil service position with NACA at Langley.\n\nOn July 29, 1958, NACA became reconstituted as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with Project Mercury initially at Langley. Huston provided training for the Mercury astronauts in celestial navigation.\n\nIn 1961 Huston accepted an invitation to transfer to the newly opened Goddard Space Flight Center to work on the Nimbus program. As deputy project manager he served as Mission Director for the successful launches of Nimbus 1, launched August 28,\n1964, Nimbus 2 on May 15, 1966, Nimbus 3 on May 14, 1969, Nimbus 4 on April 8, 1970, Landsat 1 on \nJuly 23, 1972, and Nimbus 5 on December 11, 1972. A Nimbus satellite launched in 1968 failed to reach orbit.\n\nHuston retired from NASA in 1975 and immediately took a position with OAO Corporation, later part of \nLockheed Martin Information Technology. In 1983 he retired from OAO and became self-employed until \n1988 when he retired for a third and final time.\n\nOn September 21, 1946, Huston had married Dorothy E.

His medical research led to the development of intravenous therapy and introduced the therapeutic use of \"Cannabis sativa\" to Western medicine.\n\nO'Shaughnessy was born at Limerick in 1809 to Daniel O'Shaughnessy and Sarah Boswell. Many in the family were clergymen, an uncle was the Dean of Ennis and a great uncle the Roman Catholic Bishop of Killaloe. William studied briefly at Trinity College, Dublin matriculating in 1825 but moved to Scotland before graduating. O'Shaughnessy studied forensic toxicology and chemistry in Scotland, and graduated in 1829 with an MD from the University of Edinburgh Medical School. In 1829 he was a clinical assistant of William Alison. In 1831, at the age of 22, as a result of his analysis of the blood of cholera victims, O'Shaughnessy laid the foundation, along with Thomas Aitchison Latta, for what was to become intravenous fluid and electrolyte-replacement therapy in the treatment of cholera. O'Shaughnessy analyzed the urine and blood of cholera patients and came to the conclusion that oxygen in the blood could reverse the actions. He found the blood deficient in water, salt, and \"free alkali\" and suggested that injecting salts would help. The method used by O'Shaughnessy on a dog and was developed further by Latta.\n\nO'Shaughnessy failed to obtain a position Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in the University of London and his first marriage forced him to join the service of the British East India Company on 8 August 1833 and he moved to Calcutta, remaining in India and serving initially at Gyah and Cuttack before joining the 72nd Bengal Native Infantry. He joined the 10th Regiment Bengal Light Cavalry in 1835 and was an assistant to the Opium Agent in Bihar till 5 August 1835 when he became Professor of the medical college in Calcutta. He served on the committee of the Materia Medica until 1840 and later was Chemical Examiner to the government. As chemical examiner he developed methods for forensic studies for detecting arsenic poisoning as well as botanical toxins (such as from \"Plumbago\" used as an abortifacient). He went on furlough to England in 1841 to 1844 and returned to join as Chemical Examiner and additionally as Deputy Assay Master of the Calcutta Mint.\n\nHis first stint in India was marked by work in the subjects of botanical pharmacology, chemistry, galvanic electricity, and underwater conduction, among others. He worked on modifications to the Daniell cell and the use of tanned leather semi-permeable membranes in them. He identified the use of zinc to reduce the rusting of iron before the process of galvanizing had been established. O'Shaughnessy also analyzed the gun-cotton developed by Christian Friedrich Schönbein and recognized the role of nitrogen and correctly identified the role of sulphuric acid in removing water from the cotton. He also developed a silver chloride electrode and experimented on adding colour tones to the Daguerre photographic process. At Calcutta, he was a member of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta, where he published one of his first papers on medical applications of cannabis. He validated folk uses of cannabis in India, discovered new applications, and ultimately recommended cannabis for a great variety of therapeutic purposes. O'Shaughnessy established his reputation by successfully relieving the pain of rheumatism and stilling the convulsions of an infant with cannabis. He eventually popularized its use back in England. His most famous success came when he quelled the wrenching muscle spasm of tetanus and rabies with resin. While he could not cure tetanus, he observed that the cannabis mixture reduced their symptoms of spasticity and their suffering. In 1837 he published his independent design of an electric motor. In 1839, O'Shaughnessy conducted experiments on an experimental telegraphy system that he set up in the Botanical Garden at Calcutta with the assistance of Nathaniel Wallich. A length of 22 miles of wire was laid by zigzagging them over bamboo posts. In 1841, he returned to England where he introduced \"Cannabis indica\" to Western medicine and continued his scientific writings. He was a member of the London Electrical Society and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 16 March 1843. The Candidature for Election to Fellow of the Royal Society stated that he was \"distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Medicine and Chemistry, eminent as a Physician and as a promoter of education among the natives of Bengal\". O'Shaughnessy was a supporter of the idea of education in native languages in medicine. He also wanted locally available sources of medicine to be utilized to provide inexpensive aid. As a teacher, he took students on field trips to the Botanical Garden to introduce them to the local medicinal plants. In 1837 he prepared a \"Manual of Chemistry\" of which a thousand copies were printed for use in Calcutta. A second edition was produced in 1842. Another major book was the \"Bengal Dispensatory and Pharmacopeia\" which included an appendix on the \"improvement of Bengal pottery\" (1840) since earthenware imports from Europe were proving to be expensive. The \"Bengal Dispensatory\" included descriptions of several plant species that were made or overseen by Wallich including those of \"Abelmoschus longifolius\", \"Pharbitis caerulea\", \"Hebradendron pictorium\" and \"Garcinia pictoria\". These descriptions have often been overlooked by botanists in the past.\n\nIn 1844, O'Shaughnessy returned to India where he worked in various government positions in the fields of pharmacology and assay. Lord Dalhousie became interested in the establishment of a telegraphic network and he learnt of the work of O'Shaugnessy and found that he could work on the scheme. Dalhousie informed the Military Board that O'Shaugnessy was to work directly under Dalhousie's supervision and report directly without any other intermediary authorities. During this period he began work on various telegraph instruments and systems. After briefly returning to England in 1852, O'Shaughnessy was appointed Superintendent of Telegraphs in 1852. During the years 1853-5 3500 miles of telegraph were installed across India and he wrote numerous manuals and reports on his telegraph inventions. O'Shaughnessy was on leave in England during the mutiny year but in the same year Morse code was introduced into India and a message from Delhi to Punjab helped in moving troops in time. In 1858 a cable was laid in the Gulf of Mannar between India and Ceylon. O'Shaughnessy introduced a coil of fine wire in the circuit to protect the cables from lightning. His successor in the telegraphs department, Charles Adley, became a fierce critic of O'Shaughnessy's work.\n\nIn 1856 he was knighted by Queen Victoria for his work on the telegraph in India. He was appointed Director-General of Telegraphs at this time. During the following years O'Shaughnessy wrote on telegraphy-related subjects, including a book of Private Codes for encrypted telegraphy. In 1860, O'Shaughnessy returned to Europe for sick leave where he remained in obscurity until his death from senile asthenia at Southsea on 8 January 1889. He was buried at Highland Road Cemetery, Portsmouth.\n\nHe adopted the surname Brooke by Royal Licence in 1861 on the death of a relative. He was married twice. His second wife was the daughter of Francis O'Shaughnessy and his third was Julia Greenly, daughter of Captain Sabine.\n\n"}
{"id": "12943672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12943672", "title": "William Goebel", "text": "William Goebel\n\nWilliam Justus Goebel (January 4, 1856 – February 3, 1900) was an American politician who served as the 34th Governor of Kentucky for four days in 1900 after having been mortally wounded by an assassin the day before he was sworn in (though he was on his deathbed by that time). Goebel remains the only state governor in the United States to be assassinated while in office.\n\nA skilled politician, Goebel was well able to broker deals with fellow lawmakers, and equally able and willing to break the deals if a better deal came along. His tendency to use the state's political machinery to advance his personal agenda earned him the nicknames \"Boss Bill\", \"the Kenton King\", \"Kenton Czar\", \"King William I\", and \"William the Conqueror\".\n\nGoebel's abrasive personality made him many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many allies and supporters. This conflict of opinions came to a head in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics at a time when Kentucky Republicans were gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.\n\nWilhelm Justus Goebel was born January 4, 1856, in Albany Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, the son of Wilhelm and Augusta (Groenkle) Goebel, immigrants from Hanover, Germany. The first of four children, he was born two months premature and weighed less than three pounds. His father served as a private in Company B, 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, and Goebel's mother raised her children alone, teaching them much about their German heritage. Wilhelm spoke only German until the age of six, but embraced the culture of his birth country as well, adopting the English spelling of his name.\n\nDischarged from the army in 1863, Goebel's father moved his family to Covington, Kentucky. William attended school in Covington and was then apprenticed to a jeweler in Cincinnati, Ohio. After a brief time at Hollingsworth Business College, he became an apprentice in the law firm of John W. Stevenson, who had served as governor of Kentucky from 1871 to 1877. Goebel eventually became Stevenson's partner and executor of his estate. Goebel graduated from Cincinnati Law School in 1877, then enrolled at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, but withdrew to support his family on the death of his father. Goebel was in private practice for several years, before partnering with Kentucky state representative John G. Carlisle for five years. He then rejoined Stevenson in Covington as a partner.\n\nGoebel was never known as a particularly genial person in public. He belonged to few social organizations, and greeted none but his closest friends with a smile or handshake. He was rarely linked romantically with a woman, and is the only governor of Kentucky who never married. His physical features bespoke his taciturn nature. Journalist Irvin S. Cobb remarked that Goebel's appearance was \"reptilian\", while others commented on his contemptuous lips, sharp nose, and humorless eyes. Neither was Goebel a gifted public speaker, eschewing flowery imagery and relying on his deep, powerful voice and forceful delivery to drive home his points.\n\nWhile lacking in the social qualities common to politicians, one characteristic served Goebel well in the political arenahis intellect. Goebel was well-read, and supporters and opponents both conceded that his mental prowess was impressive. Cobb concluded that he had never been more impressed with a man's intellect than he had been with Goebel's.\n\nIn 1887, James W. Bryan vacated his seat in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of lieutenant governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, but this was not to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.\n\nWith only the two years remaining in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed and sent to the Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.\n\nIn 1890, Goebel was a delegate to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as a delegate, Goebel showed little interest in participating in the process of creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.\n\nIn 1895, Goebel engaged in what many observers considered a duel with John Lawrence Sanford. Sanford, a former Confederate general staff officer turned banker, had clashed with Goebel before. Goebel's successful campaign to remove tolls from some of Kentucky's turnpikes had cost Sanford a good deal of money. It was widely believed that Sanford later blocked Goebel's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the highest court in the state. In response to this, Goebel had written an article in a local newspaper referring to Sanford as \"Gonorrhea John.\"\n\nThe duel occurred as Goebel and two of his acquaintances went to Covington to cash a check. Goebel suggested they avoid Sanford's bank, but Sanford, standing outside the bank, engaged the trio in conversation before they could cross the street to another bank. As Sanford greeted Goebel's friends, he offered his left hand, his right remaining on a pistol in his pocket. Goebel, noticing this and being likewise armed, clutched the revolver in his own pocket. Sanford asked Goebel, \"I understand that you assume authorship of that article?\" \"I do,\" replied Goebel. Witnesses agreed that both men fired at each other, but none was sure who fired first. Goebel was uninjured, the bullet passing through his coat and ripping his trousers. Sanford was struck in the head and died five hours later. Goebel was acquitted, pleading self-defense, but the shooting would haunt his political career. The acquittal was also significant because of prohibitions against duelling in the Kentucky Constitution. If Goebel had been convicted, he would have been ineligible to hold public office.\n\nDemocrats, who controlled the General Assembly, felt that county election commissioners had been unjust in selecting local election officials, and that this injustice had contributed to the election of Republican governor William O. Bradley in 1895 and Republican president William McKinley in 1896. Goebel proposed a bill, known as the \"Goebel Election Law\", which passed along sharp party lines and over Governor Bradley's veto, created a three-member state election commission, appointed by the General Assembly, to select county election commissioners. This system proved to be just as manipulable as the one it replaced, allowing the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to appoint fellow Democrats to the election commission.\n\nMany voters decried the bill as a self-serving attempt by Goebel to increase his political power, and the election board remained a controversial issue until its abolition in a special session of the legislature in 1900.\nDespite rising to the office of President Pro Tempore in 1896, Goebel became the subject of much opposition from constituencies of both parties in Kentucky after the passage of the law.\n\nThree men sought the Democratic nomination for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin appeared to be the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.\n\nGoebel took a calculated risk by breaking the agreement once his choice was installed as presiding officer. Hardin, seeing that Stone had been betrayed and hoping he might now be able to secure the nomination, re-entered the contest. Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced the man with the lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their man. Enough of them sided with Goebel to give him the nomination. Goebel's tactics, while not illegal, were unpopular and divided the party. A disgruntled faction calling themselves the \"Honest Election Democrats\" held a separate convention in Lexington and nominated John Y. Brown for governor.\n\nRepublican William S. Taylor defeated both Democratic candidates in the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2–1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered on the brink of a possible civil war.\n\nWhile the election results remained in dispute, Goebel, despite being warned of a rumored assassination plot against him, walked flanked by two bodyguards to the Old State Capitol on the morning of January 30, 1900. Reports conflict about what happened, but some five or six shots were fired from the nearby State Building, one striking Goebel in the chest and wounding him seriously. Taylor, serving as governor pending a final decision on the election, called out the militia and ordered the General Assembly into a special session, not in Frankfort, but in London, Kentucky, a Republican area. The Republican minority obeyed the call and went to London. Democrats resisted the move, many going instead to Louisville. Both groups claimed authority, but the Republicans were too few to muster a quorum.\nThe day after being shot, the dying Goebel was sworn in as governor. In his only act, Goebel signed a proclamation to dissolve the militia called up by Taylor, which was ignored by the militia's Republican commander. Despite the care of 18 physicians, Goebel died the afternoon of February 3, 1900. Journalists recalled his last words as \"Tell my friends to be brave, fearless, and loyal to the common people.\" Skeptic Irvin S. Cobb uncovered another story from some in the room at the time. On having eaten his last meal, the governor supposedly remarked \"Doc, that was a damned bad oyster.\" In respect of Goebel's displeasure with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the governor's body was transported not by the L&N direct line, but circuitously from his hometown of Covington north across the Ohio River to Cincinnati, and then south to Frankfort on the Queen and Crescent Railroad. His body lay in state in the Odd Fellows lodge.\n\nWith Goebel dead, tensions began to ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was more palatable to much of the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.\n\nCompromise having been exhausted, both sides agreed to litigate the matter. The Kentucky Court of Appeals found that the General Assembly had acted legally in declaring Goebel the winner of the election. That decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Arguments were presented in the case (\"Taylor v. Beckham\") on April 30, 1900, and on May 21, the justices decided 8–1 not to hear the case, allowing the Court of Appeals' decision to stand. The lone dissension was that of Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, a Kentucky native and a member of the Republican Party.\n\nDuring the ensuing assassination investigation, suspicion naturally focused on deposed governor Taylor, who fled to Indianapolis, Indiana under the looming threat of indictment. The governor of Indiana refused to extradite Taylor, and he was thus never questioned about his knowledge of the plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.\n\nSixteen people, including Taylor, were eventually indicted in the assassination of Governor Goebel. Three accepted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. Only five ever went to trial, two of those being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could stay in office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who was said to have been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.\n\nThe trials were fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, and at one point the juror pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts overturned Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a hung jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.\n\nYoutsey, who received a life sentence, did not appeal, but after two years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions in the details of Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.\n\nMost historians agree that the assassin of Governor Goebel will never be conclusively identified.\n\nGoebel Avenue in Elkton, Kentucky and Goebel Park in Covington, Kentucky are named in honor of the late governor.\n\n"}
