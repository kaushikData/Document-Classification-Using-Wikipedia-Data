During her life, she married two powerful businessmen, particularly adding to the success of her first husband, James Campbell, and giving him descendants. Among their grandchildren were three heirs to the throne of the kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nAbigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine Bright was born on August 22, 1858, on Lahaina, Maui. Her mother was Mary Kamai Hanaike and her father was John Maipinepine Bright. She is descended from the Kalanikini line of Maui chieftains, with some European-American ancestry on her father's side.\n\nOn October 30, 1877, she married Scotch-Irish American businessman James Campbell (1826–1900), who became one of the largest landowners in the islands. Their children were Margaret (1880–1882); Abigail (1882–1945), who became better-known as Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa after marrying a Hawaiian prince; Alice Kamokilaikawai (1884–1971) (see Alice Campbell); James, Jr. (1886–1889); Muriel (Mrs. Robert K.) Shingle (1890–1951); Royalist (1893–1896); and Beatrice (Mrs. Francis) Wrigley.\n\nDaughter Alice Kamokila Campbell became active in the anti-statehood movement after the United States annexed Hawaii, making it a Territory. Daughter Margaret, son James Campbell, Jr. and two other daughters died young.\nJames Campbell, Sr. died in 1900 and bequeathed his widow one-third of the estate during her lifetime.\n\nAfter the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Abigail Campbell and Emma Nāwahī, wife of Joseph Nāwahī, became leaders of the Hawaiian native movement for protesting the takeover, called \"Hui Hawaii Aloha Āina o Na Wahine\" (Hawaiian Women's Patriot League). She became its president.\n\nOn January 4, 1902, widow Abigail Kuaihelani Campbell married widower Samuel Parker, half owner of Parker Ranch. They had a private ceremony in the Occidental Hotel of San Francisco with a judge presiding. The Campbell estate owned the St. James Hotel in San Jose, California. At the time, Abigail Campbell was also preparing to celebrate the wedding of her daughter Abigail to Prince David Kawānanakoa, which took place two days later. The Parkers traveled to Washington, D.C..\nThey returned to California February 2, 1902; it was rumored that Parker would be appointed as the next governor of the Territory of Hawaii. George R. Carter was appointed instead. They had no children.\n\nCampbell-Parker died November 1, 1908, after surgery for breast cancer.\n"}

His real name is believed to be Ahmad Ibrahim Abu al-Hasana.\n\nAl-Jeddawi was listed by the FBI as a wanted terrorism suspect in February 2002. He was identified as a known associate of a Yemeni Al Qaeda leader named Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei.\n\nIn early 2002, according to an FBI report, as a result of US military operations in Afghanistan and of on-going interviews of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, information became available on February 11, 2002 regarding threats to US interests which indicated that a planned attack may have been about to occur in the United States or against US interests in the country of Yemen on or around the next day, February 12, 2002.\n\nIn response, on February 11, 2002, the FBI listed Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi and 16 other suspected terrorists to the FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list. The early version of that list was then known as the \"Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information\" list. Years later, the FBI removed his profile from the main page of that list.\n\nOn February 14, 2002, several days after the FBI alert, six of the names were removed from the list, and the FBI re-published the list with only eleven names and photos. Six of the suspects who had been named were already in custody.\n\nThe six names identified in the Yemen plot on February 11, 2002, but who were removed from the list on February 14, 2002, are: Issam Ahmad Dibwan al-Makhlafi, Ahmad al-Akhader Nasser Albidani, Bashir Ali Nasser al-Sharari, Abdulaziz Muhammad Saleh bin Otash, Shuhour Abdullah Mukbil al-Sabri and Riyadh Shikawi.\n\nAbu Mu'az al-Jeddawi remained listed among the eleven names still being sought on February 14, 2002. The others who also remained were: Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei, Omar Ahmad Omar al-Hubishi, Ammar Abadah Nasser al-Wa'eli, Alyan Muhammad Ali al-Wa'eli, Bassam Abdullah bin Bushar al-Nahdi, Mustafa Abdulkader Aabed al-Ansari, Samir Abduh Sa'id al-Maktawi, Abdulrab Muhammad Muhammad Ali al-Sayfi, Abu Nasr al-Tunisi and Amin Saad Muhammad al-Zumari.\n\nWhether foiled, aborted, or merely incorrect specific intelligence, the February 12, 2002 attack never occurred.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has reported that al-Jeddawi was rendered by the CIA to Amman, Jordan, in early 2002, where he was held in the custody of the Jordan's General Intelligence Department (GID). Human Rights Watch researchers spoke to two former detainees held by the GID who said that they communicated with al-Jeddawi while he was detained at the GID detention facility in late 2002; a third former detainee wrote that he saw al-Jeddawi there, too.\n\nHuman Rights Watch's sources differ regarding where al-Jeddawi was arrested. Both al-Tabuki and another person claim that al-Jeddawi was arrested in Yemen. Al-Tabuki said that he was arrested less than a month after his wedding. A third source, however, who was also held in GID custody with al-Jeddawi, believes that al-Jeddawi was arrested in Kuwait, although he was not certain about this point. All of them agree, at any rate, that al-Jeddawi was in US custody prior to being handed over to Jordan. And according to one source, a US agent \"hit him in the head.\"\n\nOne person, who told Human Rights Watch that al-Jeddawi was \"famous in Afghanistan,\" said:\n\nThis same informant not only saw al-Jeddawi in custody in late 2002 but also communicated with al-Jeddawi's family later. He said that the family told him that al-Jeddawi was held at the GID facility for more than a year, during which time he was kept hidden from the ICRC. Al-Jeddawi is believed to be currently incarcerated in Saudi Arabia.\n\nExtraordinary rendition\n\n"}

{"id": "47605616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47605616", "title": "Alex Vause", "text": "Alex Vause\n\nAlex Vause is a fictional character played by Laura Prepon on the Netflix series \"Orange Is the New Black\". The character is loosely based on the real ex-girlfriend of Piper Kerman, author of \"\". Before her arrest, Vause worked for an international drug cartel and was in a relationship with protagonist Piper Chapman, who once transported drug money for her during their travels. Vause is portrayed as the catalyst for Chapman's indictment. She is reunited with her ex-lover in federal prison, nearly a decade after the events that led to their breakup. Her relationship with Chapman is reignited, as they carry out a tumultuous love affair in prison. Vause is noted for her pragmatism, forthrightness, wit and veiled vulnerability. She is a main character in seasons one, three, four, five, and six and a recurring character in season two.\n\nThe character of Alex Vause is loosely based on Catherine Cleary Wolters, ex-girlfriend of Piper Kerman, the author of \"\" and an executive consultant on the series. In Kerman's memoir, Wolters is given the pseudonym Nora Jansen, who is a marginal character in the book. In actuality, Kerman and Wolters did not serve their prison sentences together as depicted in the series however they were reunited in a flight to Chicago, where they were detained for several weeks in a detention facility to testify in the drug trafficking case. Their stint in Chicago is portrayed in the series' second season; however, the defendant they were to testify against was changed to the cartel's kingpin, as was the fact that Wolters and Kerman were cell-mates in the prison.\n\nWolters met Kerman in 1991 in Northampton, Massachusetts, becoming friends around the time Kerman graduated from Smith College. Kerman wrote in her memoir that Wolters was part of a \"clique of impossibly stylish and cool lesbians in their mid-30s\". Wolters said both of them ran in \"the same little Noho lesbian social circle\", and spent time together when she returned from her travels. Wolters had told Kerman she worked for an African drug lord, moving heroin around internationally, while Kerman was fascinated by her globe-trotting, adventurous lifestyle. Wolters asked Kerman if she wanted to take part in the operation. According to Wolters, she and Kerman became romantically involved after Kerman had gotten involved in the drug ring. In her interview with \"Vanity Fair\", Wolters said that they were not girlfriends but friends with benefits, a notion with which Kerman disagreed, stating that they may have different perspectives about their time together and their relationship was complicated.\n\nKerman traveled with Wolters to exotic places, and made several trips carrying drug-funds for the cartel. Kerman realized she needed to walk away when Wolters asked her to transport heroin instead of money, after which she flew home and started a new life. Years later, Kerman was indicted and plead guilty to a money laundering charge, serving 13 months in a minimum-security prison in Danbury, Connecticut. Wolters was charged with conspiracy to import heroin, serving nearly six years in a Dublin, California prison, and nearly 14 years on parole. In the series, the issue of whether Vause implicated Chapman and the effect on their personal relationship is a major plot line of the first season. When Wolters and others involved in the drug ring were arrested by federal law enforcement, Wolters said that she, like the others, named everyone involved, including Kerman. Wolters also stated that, contrary to Kerman's implication in her memoir, she was not \"singularly responsible for [her] downfall\", as she was honest about what she did and getting involved was Kerman's decision. Although Kerman aimed to take responsibility for her actions, she said she still carried some resentment toward Wolters [for naming her], later making peace with her when they were held together in a Chicago facility. Unlike in the series, Wolters and Kerman did not get back together when they were reunited in prison.\n\nAccording to Wolters, \"the only [physical] similarity between myself and [Vause] is my black glasses.\" In her memoir, Kerman described Wolters as a \"droll\" woman, with a \"drawling, wisecracking husky voice\" and a \"playful, watchful way of drawing a person out\"; \"when she paid you attention, it felt as if she were about to let you in on a private joke.\" Wolters' interview to \"Vanity Fair\" in April 2014 led to a book deal for her memoir. In 2015, HarperOne released \"Out of Orange\", Wolters' memoir covering from the circumstances of her involvement in the drug trafficking ring and her relationship with Kerman, to her arrest, prison experience, and the present.\n\nVause is introduced in the first episode through flashbacks; she and Chapman were both involved in crimes involving drug money. At the end of the first episode, the audience sees that Vause and Chapman are both serving their sentences in the same prison, Litchfield Penitentiary. The two begin a romantic and sexual relationship in episode six; they are also both involved in a dispute with another inmate, Tiffany \"Pennsatucky\" Doggett (Taryn Manning), who locks Vause in a dryer and then attempts to kill Chapman in the season finale. Vause was raised solely by her mother and, in the ninth episode 'Fucksgiving', Vause's father is seen to be an influence on her being involved in the drug cartel. When Chapman realises that Vause was the one who told authorities about her illegal drug activities, they break off their relationship. Vause then becomes sexually involved with another inmate, Nicky Nichols (Natasha Lyonne).\n\nIn the first episode, Vause promises Chapman that she will lie to protect her in the upcoming trial of her former boss Kubra Balik. She breaks this promise, however, and, after testifying against Balik, Vause manages to secure release from prison while Chapman remains incarcerated. After discovering that Balik was not imprisoned for his crimes, Vause fears for her life; she is also unable to leave her apartment due to the terms of her parole. She visits Chapman in prison and confides in her that she is scared; Chapman then gets Bloom to tell Vause's parole officer that Vause is breaking her parole, which lands her back in prison, where she is safe from Balik's retribution.\n\nVause appears in every episode of the third season. Chapman reports Vause to a parole officer and she is sent back to Litchfield prison; Chapman does eventually admit to doing this and the two begin frequently having hate sex. Chapman and Vause reconcile and officially resume their relationship, but become more distant again as the season progresses; Chapman becomes romantically involved with a new inmate, Stella Carlin (Ruby Rose), and this upsets Vause. Vause becomes increasingly concerned that Balik has sent someone into the prison to spy on her and bring her harm; she suspects that this person is Lolly Whitehill (Lori Petty) and attacks her in the toilet. It turns out that Whitehill is completely delusional and thinks that Vause is from the National Security Agency. In the season finale, Vause is confronted by Balik's henchman Aydin Bayat and her fate is left ambiguous.\n\nIn the first episode, Vause is seen being strangled by Aydin Bayat in the greenhouse, struggling for her life. She is saved by Lolly Whitehill who kicks him seemingly to death. However, Vause discovers in the night that he is just barely alive and is forced to suffocate him. Vause and Whitehill, planning on burying Aydin under the floorboards, discover Frieda Berlin, who has found the body in its temporary hiding place. Together Vause, Whitehill, and Berlin dismember and bury the body in the garden. As the season progresses, Whitehill becomes increasingly at risk of blowing their cover . Meanwhile, Vause is suffering from guilt and lives in constant fear of being caught. When Berlin suggests poisoning Whitehill, Vause confides in Galina \"Red\" Reznikov, hoping she will convince Berlin otherwise. In episode 8, Vause and Chapman bond again while getting high with Nichols in the garden, and their relationship once again progresses. Aydin's body is found in an unwarranted investigation by Desi Piscatella , resulting in Whitehill being sent to psych. Vause is never questioned about his murder. Vause's guilt manifests itself in notes left around the prison, revealing Aydin's name. Chapman convinces Vause to find them all, and prepares to burn them.\n\nMatthew Wolfson of \"Slant Magazine\" described Vause as intelligent, \"with the instincts of a pragmatist, but without a strategy—a striking and emotionally direct person who may have closed off too many options for a workable future”. Dana Poccoli of \"AfterEllen\" said that Vause could be considered a villain in the first season as she is the reason Chapman is in prison, but she is also a \"fascinating character that we want to understand and spend time with.\" Writing in \"The Daily Beast\", Victoria Kezra similarly suggested that before the audience meets her, Vause is already a villain, for she is \"responsible for Chapman’s illegal activities\" and named her ex-lover to receive less prison time. What is \"wonderful\" about the character, Kezra added, is that the audience's \"perception of her changes throughout the show\", from a villainous figure to a sympathetic individual. She observed that Vause has \"a great sense of humor about the whole situation\" and is \"pretty caring and insightful\". \"TV Guide\"s Liz Raftery considered Vause a polarizing character, asking \"is she a master manipulator or just misunderstood?\". She proposed that Vause \"seems to think of herself as a bad person but maybe she isn't, whereas [Chapman] is so convinced that she's a good person and is totally taken aback whenever anyone challenges that.\" Gerri Mahn of \"Den of Geek\" wrote that unlike Chapman, Vause \"doesn’t harbor any illusions about who she is or what playing by the rules will get her\". Vause had named Chapman in her trial both to receive a lighter sentence and out of resentment from Chapman breaking her heart years earlier; she sincerely loves Chapman, Mahn considered, and \"continually came to her defense throughout season one\", turning her down when she realized Chapman was using her as \"someone to fall back on when Larry doesn’t come through\".\n\nTim Surette of TV.com said that Vause's season one flashbacks fit the character well, and \"instantly gave us a story to be interested in\", as they provided a more rounded view of the character than Chapman's purview allowed. J.M Suarez wrote in \"PopMatters\" that the character of Vause is \"fearless and intimidating\" as well as street-smart, contrary to Chapman who is \"sheltered\" and \"often afraid and deferential\", and it is \"in highlighting these differences in prison, that their eventual backstories have even more impact.\" Greco Patti of \"Vulture\" complimented Prepon's \"nuanced\" portrayal, and noted that, notwithstanding Vause's illicit occupation and her role in Chapman's imprisonment, she is a woman who \"came from nothing, who loved and lost, and who maybe got used\", and she seems more loyal and genuine in her love for Chapman. \"The A.V. Club\"s Myles McNutt considered Vause's relationship with her crimes to be \"complicated\"; he appreciates when the show does not filter character development solely through Chapman, deeming it \"productive\" when Vause had \"a chance to open up to Nicky [Nichols]”. McNutt also said that Vause's conflict with Doggett, who saw her as \"coming from privilege\", is meaningful for Vause as it is a trigger for her \"past struggles with class hierarchies\". According to McNutt, Vause's despondency regarding her absent father \"could either gain [her] new perspective and put her life on the right track or [she could] try to fill the absence as quickly as possible\", the latter of which she chose. Mahn deliberated that, growing up poor, a free ride wasn’t a possibility in Vause's world. Vause \"left her scruples at the door\" when she built her worldly life on an alliance through her father's drug dealer, Mahn assessed. \"She worked hard, gambled big, and lost everything\". \"Autostraddle\" posited that Vause hates and fears vulnerability, and the scene where she is locked in a dryer and pleads Chapman to stay echoes the past, when Vause pleaded with Chapman before Chapman left following news of Vause's mother's death. Additionally, Vause is a complicated character for the writer, primarily because she found her sexual threat to Doggett \"troubling\", while seeing Vause as a young girl \"who would do anything for the life she was cheated out of\" was something with which she empathized.\n\nIn \"Den of Geek\", Chris Longo wrote that, as the first season played out, Vause \"was vilified, then the tables turned when she won Piper’s friendship, then they turned upside down during their inevitable hookup. Alex, for all the bad she’s done, seems like a woman who stays true to her word. And now after breaking Alex’s (and Larry’s) heart, Piper is the one who’s vilified.\" Longo praised Prepon's performance, and hoped the series progressed Vause's storylines. \"The Guardian\"s Tom Meltzer wrote that Prepon plays Chapman's \"jilted\" former lover \"with subtlety and unabashed smoulder\". In his review of the first season, Matthew Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" described pre-prison Vause as \"icy cool\", and called Prepon a \"revelation\" in the role. David Hiltbrand wrote in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" that Prepon plays the character with \"real vigor\". Maureen Ryan of \"HuffPost\" also praised Prepon's portrayal, commenting that \"underneath the cool-girl exterior is a whole lot of pain and loneliness, and Prepon has done a wonderful job of subtly bringing those notes forward.\" Chris Jancelewicz of \"The Huffington Post Canada\" deemed Vause \"charismatic\", adding that Prepon \"excels as the bad girl influence\".\n\nKristi Turnquist of \"The Oregonian\" stated that although Vause would only be present in a few episodes of the second season, she \"turns up to devastating effect early on\". In a review of the first episode of season two, Horatia Harrod of \"The Daily Telegraph\" commented that Vause is dedicated to self-preservation and thought that \"another betrayal\" of Chapman \"reached new depths\", thus she found it \"puzzling\" that Vause's bad-girl routine \"seems to have won her a fan following, while [Chapman] is reviled.\" Kevin Fallon of \"The Daily Beast\" noted that there is something about Vause that \"convinces [Chapman] to throw her lifelong caution to the wind.\" Kate Zernike of \"The New York Times\" said that Vause is \"calculating\" and that \"there’s something black cat-like about [her] – she slips into the frame and you know things are about to go bad, or at least, get interesting.\" Chris Harvey of \"The Daily Telegraph\" described Prepon's turn as \"unforgettable\" and explained that Vause's wicked attitude and bespectacled look have made the character a \"cult favourite\". In her review of the season two premiere, \"The Wall Street Journal\"s Candace Jackson wrote that \"much like in Piper Kerman’s real-life experience, [the Chicago facility] is where [Chapman] runs into Vause\". Prepon is \"excellent in this role as ever\", Jackson commended, walking a \"believable line between flirtation and manipulation\". Spencer Kornhaber of \"The Atlantic\" observed that Vause was \"correct earlier in [the second season's premiere] when she diagnosed how inconsistent Chapman's worldview is: \"it is so hard to keep up with what is black and white for you\".\" According to Kornhaber, Vause’s \"return, in letter and in flashback, offers another lesson in moral relativity and personal transformation. We finally see how [Chapman's] cultivated naivety and [Vause's] cultivated knowingness created a passionate, dangerous pairing early on.\" Danielle Henderson remarked in \"Vulture\" that Vause \"has balls\" for sending Chapman letters after the incident in the season two premiere. In her review of the second season's finale, Zernike wrote that although Vause may not be the \"typical re-entering felon\", her speech to Chapman about needing to violate her probation, flee, and possibly go back to her former felonious life, \"does raise some good points\" regarding issues with the prison system.\n\n\"The Advocate\"s Nico Lang described Vause as a notably popular femme fatale character, whom the show brought back after the second season \"despite the fact that the real-life character was barely in [Kerman's memoir] at all\". Charlotte Richardson Andrews wrote in \"Sight & Sound\" that Vause is one of the show's \"believable and investment-worthy\" queer characters, adding that the \"tangled, romantic dance that [Vause and Chapman] do is compelling, nuanced and sexy where, in other hands, it might have felt exploitative\". In \"Digital Spy\", Emma Dibdin described a \"power shift\" in the third season between Vause and Chapman and how this positively impacts both characters; \"the power dynamic of [Chapman] and [Vause's] relationship is so dramatically shifted that everything about them feels fresh. [Vause] is more vulnerable than we've ever seen her, utterly shattered to find herself back in jail.\" \"The Observer\"s Orly Greenberg said Vause returns to Litchfield \"completely absent of her flashing eyes and snarky confidence, instead relying on [Chapman] as an almost maternal figure\" as Chapman leads Vause to believe her return to prison is a product of \"the system\", rather than Chapman's own doing. Emily Ambash of \"CutPrintFilm\" wrote that Vause is \"emotionally broken\" when she reenters prison; \"embarrassed and ashamed of her own choices\" and her failure in handling her brief freedom. Vause and Chapman's dynamic in the third season feels \"fresh\", different from the first season, as they confront their issues in the present without passive aggressiveness and without a focus on the past, Ambash noted; \"the characters [are forced to] question their faith not just in each other but also in themselves when dealing with each other.\" Michael Hindle of Comingsoon.net observed of Vause and Chapman's relationship, while \"one has always had power over the other in some form or another now [Vause and Chapman] are more or less on an even playing field\". Joshua Alston of \"The A.V. Club\" said that Vause's return to prison \"lands with a surprisingly soft impact\". The character Stella \"appears right on time to drive a wedge between [Chapman] and [Vause] just as a functional relationship becomes possible\", and the show \"manages to make [the looming love triangle] feel consequential.\"\n\nIn her review of the third season, Jessica Kiang of \"Indiewire\" wrote that Vause and Chapman \"come spectacularly together but find, again with some insight, that they’re a couple whose fire can burn on hate much easier than on routine.\" Libby Hill argued in her \"The New York Times\" review of the season's second episode, that the Vause and Chapman relationship has become \"toxic\". The on-off lovers have \"little meaningful interaction\" with other characters while they are entangled in their tempestuous relationship, making them \"emotionally unavailable\" to other characters and to the audience. Hill hopes Vause is more integrated into \"Litchfield's culture\" and has more humanizing interactions with other characters as she did with Nichols in the first season. In reviewing the season's second episode, \"The A.V. Club\"s Myles McNutt said that although he understands the attraction of Chapman and Vause and the significance of their intertwined story playing out in prison, their present storyline compels them to exist \"independently of anything around them\", removing them from ordinary life in the prison community of Litchfield. Perri Nemiroff of \"Collider\" felt that it was \"an unexpected and unearned twist\" that Vause would reconnect with Chapman (through \"hate sex\") soon after finding out Chapman was responsible for her being back in prison. Their role play in the prison's drama class, however, \"balances the palpable hostility with humor and heart, making the scene wildly entertaining, but also ensuring that the moment really means something, too.\" In \"Entertainment Weekly\", Jonathan Dornbush wrote that Vause and Chapman engaging in angry sex after the latter's hand in taking away her freedom is \"another shift in their power dynamic\". According to Dornbush, this occurs because Vause is \"taking control after Piper took it away from her\"; \"She’s still in jail, she’s still lost her life on the outside, and she may be in more danger now than ever\", Dornbush explained, \"but at least she can control something.\" Ambash said that the drama class improv exercise is necessary as it compels Vause and Chapman \"to consider their real-life situation\" and \"find a sort of reconciliation\". Keith Nelson Jr. of \"Digital Trends\" found Vause's speech to correctional officer Rogers, on the malleable and interpretive nature of morality, to be frank \"societal commentary\". Sarah Bredeman of \"FanSided\" opined that the commentary Vause made to Rogers is \"one of the best 'we are not your salvation, you can’t save us, and this ain’t no Dead Poet’s Society kinda situation' speeches\", and \"it really hits home a good point.\"\n\nKelly Lawler in \"USA Today\" suggested that, as opposed to how Chapman painted her, Vause's legitimate concerns over the danger she is in makes her one of the most rational individuals on the show. Perri Nemiroff of \"Collider\" said that Vause's season three flashbacks on her witnessing what her drug cartel boss is capable of made her present situation \"far more dynamic and tense\", giving her anxiety full credibility. Alan Sepinwall of \"Uproxx\" felt that Vause's flashback, like Nichols' in an earlier episode, was \"covering familiar territory solely to support prominent stories each was getting in the present\", but at least both flashbacks were \"somber\" enough to make them an \"interesting contrast\" to the concurrent comedic moments at Litchfield. In his review of the eleventh episode of the season, McNutt wrote that Vause's \"isolation is turned around, and what once felt like a failure of the show’s writing becomes a logical character choice.\" Vause wants no part in what Chapman's prison business has turned into, knowing first-hand the dangers and the damage such an operation can cause. \"I find myself respecting [Vause's] struggle to embrace her situation—it may not have served the season to this point,\" McNutt observed, \"but it serves here as a productive counterpoint to [Chapman]\". According to Ambash, Vause [and Chapman's] notable absence from the third season's final group scenes – as Vause is trapped with the man who has been sent to kill her, and Chapman is off tattooing herself in the chapel – symbolizes their heightened distrust in others and the prison system itself. \"For [Vause], unlike [Chapman], this wasn’t her choice. With safety stripped from her, and ties of trust cut by others, it’s no surprise [Vause] is kept away now from the freedom of the lake.\"\n\nAmbash noted that Vause's season three storyline \"highlights real issues regarding prisoners’ safety, especially when no real background checks are performed on new, untrained officers, who end up with easy access to inmates\". Moreover, \"it serves as a reminder that [Vause and Chapman] have basically switched roles\" as Chapman embarked on \"the smuggling business [and] showed little regard for [Vause]\", finding a new sense of power and thrill in her illicit enterprise, while Vause wisely avoided it. Lauren Chval of \"Chicago Tribune\" remarked that what is great about Vause is \"she knows who she is and what she wants\", trusts her instincts and has \"never flipped on her feelings for Chapman\". Chval praised Prepon in the role, and remarked that Vause is \"always more interesting in her scenes without Chapman\".\nPerri Nemiroff of \"Collider\" said Prepon has been successful \"taking Alex from a strong inmate you don’t want to mess with to someone super vulnerable who’s fearing for her life.\"\nRick Porter of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised Prepon's performance as Vause, in the season finale, encounters the hitman sent to kill her, writing, \"Prepon sells the heck of out Alex's disbelief and fear in the scene.\"\n\nThe aftermath of Vause's storyline has a sweeping effect throughout the fourth season according to critics. In \"Harper's Bazaar\", Emma Dibdin wrote that Vause having to kill, dismember, and bury her would-be murderer was \"the beginning of a season that saw almost every one of our beloved inmates go through her darkest hour yet.\" According to Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya of \"Autostraddle\", Vause and Lolly's \"greenhouse murder\" became one of the \"most suspenseful through lines\" of the season. Isabel Mohan wrote in \"The Daily Telegraph\" that Vause's confidence from previous seasons is gone as she has become \"a nervous wreck\" and \"her scenes are among the most macabre\" of the season. \"The Atlantic\"s Spencer Kornhaber considered Vause's \"saga\" to be some of series' \"darkest scenes yet.\" Several themes explored in the season are evoked in Vause's storyline. Jen Chaney of \"Vulture\" noted that the \"murky issues surrounding blame\" are prompted from the outset of the season, as both Vause and Lolly become responsible for the homicide of the hit man, \"yet neither of them are true 'murderers' in that both were motivated by self-defense. It’s a case of both women doing wrong and neither of them doing wrong.\" Kornhaber of \"The Atlantic\" said that Vause's acknowledgement that her attacker \"was a person\", echoed \"a mantra that’s surfaced in various forms across the season\". Myles McNutt of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote, \"the season has been consumed by the idea of guilt\" and it manifests on Vause and Chapman's attitudes and behavior; in a latter episode, they decide \"they aren’t willing to do anything that would add to their sense of guilt\". \"Vulture\"s Kathryn VanArendonk observed the notion that \"regret is real, but time only moves in one direction\" reflected on Vause and Chapman's conversation about changing the past, and the need to claim selfhood in Vause wanting to acknowledge the humanity of her attacker.\n\nMyles McNutt wrote that Vause being compelled to finish killing the man, instead of letting him die by Lolly's deed, \"makes it more visceral, and creates an internalized event to frame her understanding of her status as a 'criminal' in the season to follow.\" Hannah Shaw-Williams of \"Screen Rant\" regarded Vause taking the life of her attacker as \"one of the premiere’s most emotionally powerful scenes, which reveals that despite her background as a hard-as-nails heroin dealer, Vause has never actually had to kill anyone before.\" In \"Paste magazine\", Matt Brennan commended \"the quiet, tearful moment in which [Vause] ... decides to end his life.\" \"Her remorse\", Brennan noted, \"for this choice, and for all the choices that led to it, is palpable, even if his death amounts to self-defense.\" Emma Dibdin wrote in \"Digital Spy\" that while Vause's on-off lover Chapman \"[insists] she's a force to be reckoned with\", Vause \"goes through the real moral transformation, pushed to brutal extremes by the hitman sent to kill her.\" Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya of \"Autostraddle\" considered the scenes of Vause helping Lolly reconcile her thoughts and emotions \"a cutting and intimate look at self-care and coping mechanisms.\" \"The Atlantic\"s Spencer Kornhaber similarly reviewed Vause's \"counseling\" of Lolly, finding it a \"succinct and touching glimpse at post-traumatic coping\". McNutt opined in \"The A.V. Club\" that the circumstances of Lolly's paranoia, the lack of evidence that the correctional officer was a hit man, the lack of trust in a broken system, and the difficulty in explaining away Vause and Lolly's actions in the homicide, meant that Lolly being taken away was \"tragic\" but ultimately \"probably the best case scenario\" when someone would have to be held responsible.\n\n\"Autostraddle\" Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya considered Vause's decision to not tell Chapman what she has gone through an \"emotionally significant\" moment for the character. Vause is not on good terms with Chapman, but she also does not want Chapman to be implicated by it, Upadhyaya observed. According to Upadhyaya, apart from it being an overarching plot, the homicide has also had \"long-term emotional significance\" for Vause. Ed Power of \"The Telegraph\" found it \"wrenching\" to see Vause \"haunted by doubt and guilt\", praising the show for \"peeling back the layers, showing a new side to a person we thought we already knew\" and the \"disquiet and disbelief that flashed across [Vause's] face\" in response to Chapman in the crack scene. Alan Sepinwall of \"Uproxx\" wrote that Vause and Chapman needing to be under the influence of drugs \"to finally be honest with each other about all their recent tragedies seemed about right for a relationship that's always thrived on a high level of drama.\" In her review of the season's ninth episode, Pilot Viruet of \"Decider\" remarked that it is \"good to see [Vause and Chapman] getting along and not plagued by relationship dramatics.\" In his review of the season's finale, McNutt wrote that he found Vause \"reacting to death by thinking about the hitman’s humanity rang true to her arc\". Prepon received praise for her performance in the fourth season. Dana Schwartzof of \"The Observer\" lauded Prepon in the premiere episode writing that her performance should be up for Emmy consideration. Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya of \"Autostraddle\" wrote that Prepon is \"giving her best performance to date on the show, effectively capturing the turmoil of Alex’s mind and the psychological toll of this secret.\"\n\nPrepon won the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 18th Satellite Awards for her performance as Vause.\n\n\n"}

In January 2012, a book was published posthumously by Gronholdt titled \"Chagudax: A Small Window into the Life of An Aleut Bentwood Hat Carver\" Gronholdt's woodworking techniques, wood steaming and bending methods, and instructional design methodologies were legendary.\n\nAndrew Gronholdt was born on August 26, 1915 in Sand Point on Popof Island in the Shumagin Islands. Gronholdt's father was Niels Peter Gronholdt from Kerteminde, Denmark. Gronholdt's mother is Anna Dushkin, who was from a tiny Aleut village on the southside of the Alaska Peninsula named Belkofski, about a dozen miles north east of King Cove, Alaska. The ancient Unangan people lived at Belkofski for thousands of years, but the community was closed about 1980 when everyone moved out, mostly to King Cove.\n\nAndrew began attending elementary school in Belkofski and later completed grade school in Sand Point in the Shumagin Islands. Graduation from eighth grade at Sand Point School ended Gronholdt's formal education, but \"his own desire to discover and explore schooled him for the rest of his life\".\n\nOn January 21, 1942 at Unga, Gronholdt married Elisabeth Z. Rodgers, the daughter of Frank Rodgers and Zenia Lois Larsen. They had one child, born in Seward.\n\nWhile living in Sand Point on Popof Island in the Shumagin Islands amongst the members of the Qagun Tayagungin Tribe, the Unga Tribe, and the Pauloff Harbor Tribe, Gronholdt designed \"chagudax\" (the ancient Unangan word for \"hunting visor\") in the Aleutians. Based upon the elaborate design of his maritime hunting ancestors, Gronholdt carved slabs of wood into thin blanks which he steamed and bent over molds to form the complex shapes of these ancient bentwood hats.\n\nHe began researching hat construction methods in 1985. Gronholdt, believing that the creation of these bentwood hunting hats was an important component of the ancient Unangan culture, went from Sand Point to several other communities within the Aleutians, teaching others this lost art. Gronholdt taught at several schools including Sand Point and Unalaska. Gronholdt's students teach chagudax at Aleut cultural camps. The chagudax classes are well attended, often filled to the limit. Students cherish the chagudax which they carved, steamed, and bent. They carry them home with a deep sense of cultural pride as a symbol of ancient Aleut ways.\n\nThe \"chagudax\" was an important component of the Unangan sea kayaker's hunting and battle uniform. The sight of a fleet of Aleut men, fully dressed in battle uniform with their \"chagudax\" and the decks of their sea kayaks bristling with razor sharp spears with which they were deadly accurate at long distances, struck fear into the hearts of enemies and excitement into the hearts of Aleut women. \"All travelers are unanimous in stating that the Aleut in full attire and in his baidarka has a handsome and indeed a majestic appearance\"(p. 275)\n\nGronholdt's visors are featured in collections at the Anchorage International Airport, the Unalaska City School Percent for Art, the Shumagin Corporation and the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association.\n\nGronholdt had a background as a wooden boat builder. He also crafted wooden pumps, known as chxuusi-x, which was used to bail water out of the skin-on-frame iqyax, the Aleut sea kayaks.\n\nGronholdt believed in the importance of the Aleut people getting involved and voicing their opinion to help make the community better, serving on the Board of Directors for the Shumagin Corporation (1972 through 1974) and serving for over 21 years (1977 through 1998) on the Board of Directors in several positions at the Aleut Corporation.\n\nIn September 1989, Gronholdt was chosen as an instructor at the Institute of Alaska Native Art's prestigious \"Bending Tradition\" program which was \"charged with creative energy\" (p. 10) and his area of the wood working shop quickly became known as \"Aleut Corner\" (p. 10) as the plethora of bentwood hunting visors poured forth.\n\nOkalena Patricia Lekanoff-Gregory, Unalaska Aleut artist, has been one of Gronholdt's more prolific students, having instructed classes throughout the Aleutians and Northwest United States. At the beginning of each of her classes, Okalena Patricia Lekanoff-Gregory tells all of her new students about her great instructor, Andrew Gronholdt, and has a fine portrait of Gronholdt displayed at the carving table, next to the carving knives. An important component of Aleut values is to acknowledge Unangax elders. In 2011 Lekanoff-Gregory worked with the Smithsonian's Arctic Studies Center to produce a video titled in which she provides an overview of how the bentwood hats are carved, steamed, and bent. Lekanoff-Gregory also honors having learned chagudax from Gronholdt.\n\nGronholdt died on March 13, 1998 in Edmonds, Washington at the age of 82. Gronholdt was laid to rest at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park next to his wife Elisabeth. Their gravestone is engraved, \"Together Forever\". Since his death, some of his former students have continued his teaching. His legacy of building \"chagudax\" continues into the future as instructors at Aleut culture camp use forms and jigs he built to teach new generations about the proud warriors who defended their coastal villages wearing these unique hunting visors. The Aleut Foundation offers the Andrew Gronholdt Scholarship Award to Aleut students majoring in the arts.\n\nIn January 2012 Gronholdt's photographs, diary, and drawings were published in a book titled \"Chagudax: A Small Window into the Life of an Aleut Bentwood Hat Carver\". Most of the material in the book was created by Gronholdt and includes many photographs of the chagudax which he designed, carved, steamed and bent. The 96-page book, edited by Michael Livingston and Sharon Gronholdt-Dye, contains 144 illustrations. Gronholdt's diary details his younger years in the Shumagin Islands when times were sometimes hardscrabble such as near-starvation of the entire Gronholdt family on remote Dolgoi Island in the 1920s. Gronholdt's distinctly optimistic world view shines a bright light into life in the Shumagin Islands in the early 20th century.\n\n"}

The story of Antipus and his army is detailed in the 56th chapter of the Book of Alma. In 66 BC Antipus' army was strengthened with the 2,000 warriors under the leadership of Helaman. Helaman and Antipus engaged the invading Lamanite army by a stratagem in which Helaman and his 2,000 played decoy. Helaman was to lead away the Lamanite army while Antipus attacked from behind. After three days of the Lamanites pursuing Helaman, Antipus and his army finally overtook and engaged the Lamanites. However, in the battle Antipus was slain and his army only avoided complete defeat when Helaman and his 2,000 also joined the battle.\n"}
{"id": "266084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=266084", "title": "Arnold Rimmer", "text": "Arnold Rimmer\n\nArnold Judas Rimmer is a fictional character in the science fiction situation comedy \"Red Dwarf\", played by Chris Barrie. He is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule. After he is killed by a radiation leak during a timeskip in the series' first episode \"The End\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated hologram, indicated by the ‘H’ symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"Legion\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"Stoke Me a Clipper\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by nanobots with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries \"\" (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in \"Back to Earth\" and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through nanotechnology. The fictional world of \"Red Dwarf\" would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.\n\nThe creators of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's surname comes from a snobby prefect with whom they attended school. They joke that only the boy's name was used, and not his personality because that would imply he had one.\n\nRimmer first appeared in \"Red Dwarf\"s first episode \"The End\" (1988), where he is characterised as second technician on board the mining ship \"Red Dwarf\", ranking above Dave Lister (Craig Charles), the lowest ranked crew member on board the ship with whom he shares quarters, and below all four of the service robots. As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on chicken soup vending machines that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from stasis, where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer Holly (Norman Lovett) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a hologram, having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board \"Red Dwarf\" is a creature called \"Cat\" (Danny John-Jules), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis.\n\nBy the time of \"Future Echoes\" (1988), Rimmer claims to have taken the \"astronavigation exam\" without passing nine times, or \"[t]en, if you count the time [he] had [his] spasm.\" He also claims in this episode that his father had said, \"Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut, and you can cope with anything,\" right before \"that unfortunate suicide business\".\n\nIn \"Balance of Power\" (1988), Holly reveals that reason Rimmer was brought back as a hologram was because, in Holly's judgment, Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane because the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, making Rimmer the crew member with which Lister had the most interaction; in Holly's judgment, the fact that their interactions were almost entirely antagonistic was irrelevant. Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski's (C P Grogan) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again. Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.\n\nIn \"Confidence and Paranoia\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a concussion. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.\n\nIn \"Me²\" (1988), Rimmer is shown moving in with his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at night school, although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with \"Citizen Kane\". Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"gazpacho soup\". Demonstrating intense, literal self-hatred, the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during he made a \"faux pas\" where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"Better Than Life\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by John Abineri) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of malnutrition. Rimmer's father also stretched his sons on a traction machine to make them taller, causing Frank to be 6'5\" by the time he was eleven. Rimmer disliked his parents enough to the point where he divorced them from himself when he was fourteen; Rimmer getting paid maintenance until employment age and access to the family dog every fourth weekend.\n\nAccording to \"Thanks for the Memory\" (1988), Rimmer did a maintenance course at Saturn Tech. Rimmer also claims that his sexual liaison with McGruder was the only point in his entire life he had made love.\n\nIn \"Queeg\" (1988), Rimmer mentions how, after being burnt once by a person he considered his best friend, he had considered no-one in his life to be \"true friends\", and that friends were only friends when it suits them. He explains that when he was fifteen, he had a \"friend\", Porky Roebuck, to whom Rimmer believed that Porky's father having an affair with Rimmer's mother proved how close he and Porky were. Porky and Rimmer went on a Space Scouts survival course together, where Porky was the ringleader of a plan to eat Rimmer; Rimmer being tied to a stake and having barbecue sauce poured on him before he was almost cooked. Lister believes that Porky was \"only\" bullying Rimmer.\n\n\"Parallel Universe\" (1988) shows Holly's \"Holly Hop Drive\" trying to get to Earth within a few seconds. Instead, however, it lands the crew in a female-oriented parallel universe with another version of \"Red Dwarf\"; its crew including a female version of Rimmer called Arlene Rimmer (played by Suzanne Bertish). Regarding Rimmer as little more than a \"discardable sex object\", the female Rimmer sexually harasses and gropes Rimmer and tries to hypnotise him even after Rimmer shows no interest.\n\nIn \"Backwards\" (1989), Rimmer facilitates a driving test for the mechanoid Kryten (Robert Llewellyn), where Kryten causes the \"Starbug 1\" shuttle to fall into a time hole. The ship crash lands on Earth in a reality where time runs backwards, leaving Kryten, Rimmer and Holly (now played by Hattie Hayridge) stranded. Rimmer and Kryten start working as the novelty act \"the Sensational Reverse Brothers\" and begin to enjoy life in this new reality, but after three weeks, they are fired by a pub manager (Arthur Smith) for a fight that Rimmer and Kryten only become involved in later that night. Lister and the Cat come to rescue Rimmer, Kryten and Holly in another \"Starbug\" to get back to \"Red Dwarf\".\n\nAccording to backstory in \"Marooned\" (1989), Rimmer did not lose his virginity to McGruder, but to a girl Rimmer met at cadet school called Sandra in the back of his brother's car. However, when adapted in the novel \"Better Than Life\" (1990), it is revealed Rimmer was lying.\n\nIn \"Polymorph\" (1989), Rimmer considers the relationship he had with his brothers to be \"close\". He mentions that he was the butt of the \"occasional\" practical joke growing up. Despite varying from apple pie beds and black eye telescopes to hiding a small land mine in Rimmer's sandpit, Rimmer believes that none of this was \"sinister\". Rimmer says that some considered his mother (played by Kalli Greenwood) to be cold and aloof, but himself believes that she had no time for fools. Rimmer believes this to be \"tragic\", because they would otherwise have got on \"famously\".\n\nIn \"Timeslides\" (1989), Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a photographic slide with mutated developing fluid, and tells his seventeen-year-old self (played by Emile Charles) how to gain a successful multi-billion-pound business empire with fifty-eight houses by inventing the \"tension sheet\" so that he won't join the Space Corps and get trapped on \"Red Dwarf\" in deep space. By becoming the inventor of the tension sheet and never joining the Space Corps, Lister's entire timeline is altered, causing Kryten to never be rescued and the Cat race to no longer exist. Rimmer is left on his own with Holly, and tries going back further in time to his eight-year-old self's (played by Simon Gaffney) days in boarding school so that \"he\" invents the tension sheet. Rimmer unwittingly sets things how they were before by causing the original inventor of the tension sheet—Thickie Holden (Stephen McKintosh), who is in the same dormroom as Rimmer and overhears Rimmer speaking to his younger self—to become the one who patents the tension sheet, but for reasons unclear to both Holly and Rimmer, Rimmer somehow changes his past so that he is alive back on \"Red Dwarf\". His happiness is short-lived, however, as he dies within minutes anyway after hitting a box containing explosives.\n\nRimmer is seen in the next episode, \"The Last Day\" (1989), once again as a hologram. According to his backstory, Rimmer's parents were \"Seventh-day Advent Hoppists\", and believed that every Sunday should be spent hopping, because their version of the Bible had a misprint in 1 Corinthians 13 and they had interpreted this passage literally. He mentions that the first time he was French kissed was from his Uncle Frank. He had come into the wrong room and thought Rimmer was his mum.\n\nAccording to Lister in \"Justice\" (1991), before the nuclear accident that killed the crew of \"Red Dwarf\", Rimmer was in charge of \"Z Shift\", and it occupied his every waking moment. Lister said that Z Shift's most vital responsibility was making sure the vending machines didn't run out of fun size Crunchie bars.\n\nIn \"Dimension Jump\" (1991), an alternate Arnold Rimmer, whose friends call him \"Ace\", is shown as a successful and heroic test pilot in the Space Corps and commander who crosses dimensions to meet another Rimmer—the hologrammatic Rimmer living on \"Red Dwarf\". Ace's interdimensional ship collides with the \"Starbug\" shuttle, causing it to crash land on an ocean planet. With Lister's help, Ace repairs \"Starbug\"s starboard engine. After returning to \"Red Dwarf\", Ace decides he can't stay, as he couldn't bear to be near the weaselly Rimmer of this universe. Ace can't return home but decides to explore other realities with \"a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet.\" Ace explains that the diverging point in their lives where Ace gets his big break and Rimmer doesn't is that at the age of seven, Ace went down a year in his class while Rimmer stayed up. Being kept down a year was according to Ace what changed him and made him fight back.\n\nAccording to \"Meltdown\" (1991), Rimmer's only physical presence is a small \"light-bee\"; a piece of hardware which buzzes around and projects his holographic image. This has been contradicted on a few occasions by his ability to move completely through solid objects such as walls or by the ability of solid objects or living characters to pass completely through Rimmer.\n\nIn \"Demons and Angels\" (1992), \"Red Dwarf\" is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a \"high\" and \"low\" version of \"Red Dwarf\", complete with their own versions of Rimmer (both played by Barrie). Before the lifespans of both versions of \"Red Dwarf\" expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both \"Red Dwarf\"s, and restore the original \"Red Dwarf\" by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The \"high\" version of Rimmer has his light-bee crushed by Lister when Lister's \"low\" self controls Lister into doing this by remote control, while the \"low\" version disappears with his version of \"Red Dwarf\".\n\nIn \"Back to Reality\" (1992), ink from a \"despair squid\" causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider \"quintessential to [their] self-esteem\". In the hallucination, Rimmer believes he is a vagrant with a coat smelling of yak's urine called Billy Doyle, with Lister being his more important half-brother, a totalitarian fascist mass murderer called Sebastian. Kryten also explains that because \"Billy\" has the same upbringing growing up with \"Sebastian\", Rimmer couldn't blame his own shortcomings on Rimmer's parents. The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second.\n\nIn \"Psirens\" (1993), Kryten explains that \"Red Dwarf\" was \"stolen\", with the crew now based inside \"Starbug\" chasing after \"Red Dwarf\" to recover it.\n\nIn \"Legion\" (1993), Rimmer encounters a being known as Legion (Nigel Williams), who upgrades Rimmer's projection unit from \"soft light\" to \"hard light\", giving him a physical form and the ability to interact directly with the world, in addition to making him virtually indestructible.\n\nIn \"\" (1993), an emotion-leeching \"emohawk\" attacks \"Starbug\" and consumes Rimmer's bitterness, turning him into his \"Ace Rimmer\" persona. The emohawk is captured, and Lister freezes it with liquid dillinium. The crew plan to extract the emohawk's DNA strands and re-inject Rimmer with them to return his emotions to normal, but the Cat clumsily freezes everyone else before this can be done.\n\nIn \"Rimmerworld\" (1993), Rimmer steals an escape pod locked on course with the nearest habitable planet. Because of the time dilation caused by the pod going through a wormhole, it takes six hundred years from Rimmer's perspective for \"Starbug\" to catch up with him, even though it's only moments from the point of view of \"Starbug\". In the meantime, using cloning equipment inside the pod, Rimmer uses his DNA to create a society of thousands of Arnold Rimmers (all played by Barrie), who backstab Rimmer and imprison him before Lister, the Cat and Kryten rescue him centuries later.\n\nIn \"Out of Time\" (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of \"Red Dwarf\" has been lost. In the episode, a \"Starbug\" from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten's future selves intending to copy some components from the present \"Starbug\"s time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the Habsburgs, the Borgias, Louis XVI, Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future \"Starbug\" fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing \"Starbug\" up.\n\nIn the following episode, \"Tikka to Ride\" (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future \"Starbug\" destroying the \"Starbug\" of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of \"Starbug\" in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered.\n\nIn \"Stoke Me a Clipper\" (1997), Rimmer is approached by a dying Ace Rimmer (played by Barrie), who is not the Ace Rimmer which Rimmer had met previously, nor an immediate replacement but a distant successor and a hard light hologram with a damaged light-bee. Ace asks Rimmer to become a defender of the multiverse upon Ace's death. Although initially hesitant, Arnold finds himself rising to the challenge and leaves to start his new life. Lister, for a time, desperately misses him, and it takes a therapeutic song by a simulation of Rimmer (played by Barrie), shown in \"Blue\" (1997), to remind him what a horrible presence he could be.\n\nWhen \"Red Dwarf\" is restored by Kryten's nanobots at the end of the episode \"Nanarchy\" (1997), the entire crew is restored to life as well by a new set of nanobots created by Holly (again played by Norman Lovett) after Kryten's had gone missing, including Rimmer, as shown in \"Back in the Red\" (1999). Because he is resurrected as he was at the time of the accident, he lacks any of the growth that the \"other\" Rimmer has gone through since the series began, reverting him back to his original persona. In \"Back in the Red\", Lister, Rimmer, Kryten, Cat and Kochanski (now played by Chloë Annett) are sentenced to two years in the ship's brig for misuse of confidential information. In \"Cassandra\" (1999), the five of them get signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries after Holly lies to Lister that they're a singing troupe.\n\nIn \"Only the Good...\" (1999), when a corrosive micro-organism is shown destroying \"Red Dwarf\" and everyone else evacuates to a mirror universe, Rimmer is trapped on the disintegrating ship. At the end of the episode, he encounters the Grim Reaper, who announces that Rimmer is dead and then tells him that they'll travel to the River Styx. Rimmer interrupts him, saying \"Not today, matey!\", knees him in the groin, says \"Remember, only the good die young!\", and flees.\n\nIn \"\" (2009), set nine years later, \"Red Dwarf\" is intact; the human race is apparently \"virtually extinct\" in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be a hard light hologram and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism is not explained. In this special, a female \"despair squid\", whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called \"Red Dwarf\", and their dimension is \"invalid\". This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest \"valid\" reality. They confront the \"Creator\" of \"Red Dwarf\" (Richard O'Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they're hallucinating, and they wake up on board \"Red Dwarf\". Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid.\n\nIn \"Trojan\" (2012), Rimmer discovers that one of his brothers, Howard (Mark Dexter), serves as a hologram on a Space Corps vessel. Rimmer lies to his brother, telling him that he is the captain of the abandoned space vessel \"Trojan\". To his surprise, he finds that Howard is, like him, a vending machine repairman who became the superior officer on his ship. In Howard's case this followed an attack by Simulants. Howard is mortally wounded during a skirmish with the rogue Simulant who killed the crew, Sim. Crawford (Susan Earl), and Rimmer takes the opportunity to further lie to Howard on his deathbed about his lifestyle.\n\nAccording to Rimmer's backstory in \"Lemons\" (2012), Rimmer was given the middle name \"Judas\" because Judas, as characterised by the religious denomination that Rimmer's mother belonged to, the Church of Judas, embodied all of the traits Rimmer's mum wanted him to have. According to the Church of Judas, Jesus asked Judas, whom the Church believed was Jesus' twin brother, to swap places with him; Judas sacrificing himself and his reputation so that Jesus would appear to have been resurrected after showing up following the crucifixion of Judas.\n\nIn a flashback depicted in \"The Beginning\" (2012), Rimmer is shown during his youth (played by Philip Labey) attending Io Polytechnic on Io, where one of his lecturers covering psychological profiling is the man he believes is his father, Lecturer Rimmer (now played by Simon Treves). After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding peer pressure. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board \"Blue Midget\" being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to \"Red Dwarf\".\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\". This is a combination of the respective memories of the hologram Rimmer, who later became Ace, and the resurrected Rimmer who faced Death in the Series VIII cliffhanger. However, attempts by Rimmer and Kryten to explain how he saved the ship at the end of that series are interrupted.\n\nIn \"Officer Rimmer\" (2016), Rimmer is promoted to first lieutenant by a bio-printed copy of Captain Herring (Stephen Critchlow), when Rimmer saves Herring's ship the \"Nautilus\" by a fluke. He separates \"Red Dwarf\" by instigating a class system, and sets up an officers' club featuring copies of himself (played by Barrie). Rimmer accidentally creates a monstrous amalgamation of Rimmers (also played by Barrie) that absorbs all the other Rimmers apart from the original. Rimmer resigns his rank, again becoming second technician, so he can leave the officers' corridor and get to safety. Lister, Cat and Kryten subsequently kill the monster.\n\nAccording to backstory in \"Timewave\" (2017), when Rimmer was six, his parents sent him to a different prep school, St Tremble's, so he could get his confidence back after being ridiculed every day and wedgied every night. According to Rimmer, games were not competitive there, and everyone won a \"you're really special\" trophy on sports day. He said that his sex life had been a \"shambles\" ever since one of Rimmer's brothers told him sex advice at school that the most important thing was the clitoris; Rimmer misheard it as \"to spit on her wrist\".\n\nIn \"Mechocracy\" (2017), Kryten is elected president of the machines on \"Red Dwarf\" after running against Rimmer.\n\nIn \"Skipper\" (2017), Rimmer, in search of a fresh start, decides to leave his universe using a quantum skipper that can skip to other universes where he feels less of a loser. In his first jump to a new universe it is the moment just before he causes the radiation leak but, for an unexplained reason, he is a hologram with his old letter 'H' on his forehead when this happened. After multiple attempts at finding a suitable universe, Rimmer arrives in a universe where he is alive, married and a navigation officer. However, upon discovering Lister is more successful and rich than he is, Rimmer returns to his original universe and breaks the quantum skipper, finding the pain of living in that universe \"too much\".\n\nIn \"\" (1989), Rimmer is a First Technician. Rimmer first meets Lister while \"Red Dwarf\" is docked at Mimas, a moon of Saturn. There, Rimmer is under the persona of \"Officer Christopher Todhunter\" and dons a phony admiral uniform and false mustache. He encounters Lister, who has stolen the Mimas-equivalent of a taxi known as a 'Hopper' to earn money, and pays him to take him to the red-light district of the city where Rimmer plans to frequent a droid brothel, while lying and saying he intends to eat at a restaurant.\n\nUnlike in the television series, Rimmer's incompetence does not cause the radiation leak that kills the crew. Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.\n\nIn \"Better Than Life\" (1990), similar to the episode of the same name, the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive virtual reality video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's subconscious desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game.\n\nIn \"Last Human\" (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night, leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off \"Red Dwarf\" where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard \"Red Dwarf\". She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the \"Mayflower\", a large spaceship with terraformation capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the black box of \"Red Dwarf\" he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the \"Mayflower\", separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a gestalt manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.\n\nIn \"Backwards\" (1996), following the attempted kidnapping of the crew by the Agonoids, a race of misanthropic robots, \"Starbug\" is infected with the Armageddon Virus. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the American wild west, is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the Apocalypse Boys, the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending \"Starbug\" inoperable.\n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author Rob Grant, the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard \"Starbug\".\n\nRimmer's primary character traits include anal-retentiveness, over-adherence to protocol, cowardice, bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of self-loathing, which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others. As the highest ranking survivor aboard the ship (despite being a hologram), Rimmer often deludes himself into believing that he is in charge and that he has somehow been moulding \"his\" crew into an effective spacegoing unit, despite the fact that the others tend to take suggestions from Lister or Kryten in a crisis.\n\nRimmer's poor repair work on the drive plate was responsible for the radiation leak that killed the crew, and Rimmer bore the guilt of this (although he also partly blamed Lister for the accident, as he was unable to help repair the drive plate due to being in stasis at the time). However, in \"Justice\" (1991), after Rimmer is jailed for over 9000 years for the accident, Kryten successfully argues at his appeal that Rimmer's guilt is misplaced – as a second technician (and one who \"couldn't outwit a used teabag\"), he could not possibly have been responsible for (and indeed would not have been trusted with) work that might endanger the crew if not performed correctly. Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment. In keeping with his defective personality, Rimmer continually objects to his own defence (despite its effectiveness) on the grounds that he believes he is being portrayed unfairly.\n\nRimmer was finally able to live his fantasy of commanding an army in the episode \"Meltdown\" (1991), leading an army of \"good\" wax-droids against a much larger force of \"evil\" wax-droids. Although Rimmer ultimately succeeds in destroying the opposing army, his forces are completely wiped out when he uses most of them as a diversion and then has Kryten turn up the heating to melt all the droids. In addition to his fondness for militarism, elitism and Hammond organ music, Rimmer also enjoys Morris dancing and is an authority on 20th century telegraph poles, especially those observed while train spotting. Rimmer has also been attempting to learn Esperanto for eight years, but has failed miserably. In \"Marooned\" (1989), he reveals he used to play golf and hated people (like Lister) who abused the facilities.\n\nMany episodes of \"Red Dwarf\" focus on the conflict between Rimmer's ego and his neuroses. In \"Confidence and Paranoia\" (1988), Rimmer manages to trick Lister into generating a hologram duplicate in order to provide him with a companion; however, as a consequence of Rimmer's self-loathing, in the follow-up episode \"Me²\" (1988), the two Rimmers are incapable of getting along, and their interaction becomes so bitter and hate-filled that the duplicate must be turned off. In \"Terrorform\" (1992), a \"psi-moon\" sculpted to reflect Rimmer's psychological make-up becomes a desolate, swampy hell-hole dominated by Rimmer's Self-Loathing, personified as a sadistic beast, with a metaphysical graveyard marking the \"demise\" of his various virtuous qualities. Despite his cowardice, and tendency to run from any kind of danger or fight, Rimmer is the member of the crew most willing to kill, preferably in the safest and most cowardly way possible, although, due to a mixture of cowardice, and the fact that for much of the series he cannot physically harm anyone, he seldom manages to. He attempts to coerce Lister to shoot a dangerous Simulant (Nicholas Ball) in the back (bemoaning the fact that said Simulant was currently awake), suggests shooting Kryten and Lister into space when they appeared on the ship in a timeline where they had been erased from history, suggests that he and Kryten eject Lister and Cat from \"Starbug\" when it is revealed that the ship lacks fuel to reach the nearest planet — although this is also prompted by the discovery that the ship only had air for seven minutes and was ended when Rimmer learned that his projection unit only had enough power for four minutes — and in a despair squid-induced hallucination of 21st century Earth, casually pushes a fellow hologram (Sophie Winkleman) into traffic after she repeatedly threatens to have him \"erased\" and claims that hologram-killing is \"morally, ethically [...] fine\". In \"Officer Rimmer\" (2016), Rimmer deems it better to sacrifice others for the safety of the crew.\n\nRimmer's personality flaws are in fact almost completely a result of his hang-ups. An alternative version of Rimmer, Ace Rimmer, who was kept back a year in school, learned humility and inner strength and grew up to become a charming and well liked Space Corps test pilot, interstellar hero, and sexual seducer.\n\nSurprisingly, however, Rimmer is still capable of nobility, honour and love. When \"Red Dwarf\" encounters a holoship with an all-hologram crew composed of the \"best and brightest\" in the episode \"Holoship\" (1991), Rimmer desperately wants to join. A female officer aboard the ship, Nirvanah Crane, played by Jane Horrocks, falls in love with him and sacrifices her place on the ship for Rimmer, only for Rimmer to do the same in return for her. This act of nobility surprises even Rimmer himself. In \"Out of Time\" (1993), Rimmer is disgusted by his corrupt future self to the point where he'd rather do battle with him than surrender (\"Better dead than smeg!\"), Rimmer later frantically risking his life to save the others after their future selves kill them. In \"The Beginning\" (2012), Rimmer is also able to formulate a plan to save the crew from the Simulant Generals. Rimmer has also showed the capacity to respect other viewpoints in conflict with his own; in \"The Last Day\" (1989), he tries to convince Lister that he should respect Kryten's right to believe in Silicon Heaven in spite of it conflicting with Lister's own beliefs and in \"Lemons\" (2012), Rimmer was eager to meet Jesus despite being an atheist. In \"Polymorph\" (1989), Rimmer leads Kryten and Cat in the hunt for the intruder and in \"Bodyswap\" (1989), he takes charge of the hunt for \"Red Dwarf's\" self-destruct mechanism. Once Rimmer is sapped of his anger by the Polymorph, he is a conciliatory pacifist wishing to promote peace between the creature and various members of the crew and keen to not hurt anybody's feelings during their discussions. In \"Backwards\" (1989), he revels in his success as a showbiz performer and extols the virtues of a world without war, famine, crime or death. In \"Tikka to Ride\" (1997), Rimmer protests against abusing the Time Drive and chastises Lister for doing so.\n\nRimmer's status as a hologram in most episodes of \"Red Dwarf\" is shown by the 'H' on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from the Cat, such as \"alphabet head\" and \"goalpost head\". Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair relatively short, deciding that it makes him feel like more of a man. When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that \"every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts\" (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head).\n\nRimmer's Space Corps uniform changes several times during the course of the show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special \"Back to Earth\", Rimmer wears a blue suit similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the addition of a plain waist-high belt worn over the jacket and a quilted collar. From Series X onward, Rimmer sports a dark blue tunic; lacking the belt and light blue boots of the \"Back to Earth\" outfit.\n\nThe 'H' on his forehead also changes from series to series: it starts as a grey colour and a blocky shape, then, in Series III, it becomes bright blue and reflective, and then, in Series V, its shape is changed to a thinner and more stylised font. His 'H' also briefly changes to a reflective red colour set inside a circle when he temporarily joins the holoship SS \"Enlightenment\".\n\nAmong the actors who auditioned for Rimmer were Norman Lovett (who went on to play Holly instead), David Baddiel, Hugh Laurie, and Alfred Molina. Initially Molina was cast as Rimmer, however, the role was recast and filled by Chris Barrie, a professional voice-actor and impressionist. Barrie, who had originally auditioned for Lister, was familiar with Rob Grant and Doug Naylor having worked together on \"Son of Cliché\" and \"Spitting Image\", and with the producers on \"Happy Families\" and various Jasper Carrott productions. He has appeared in all but four episodes of the show, which he missed in series VII due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nRimmer was played by Chris Eigeman in the first American pilot and then by Anthony Fusco in the second pilot. The character's distinctive 'H' was replaced with a marble-shaped object in the first pilot, but the 'H' returned in the second one. Chris Barrie was given an offer to reprise his role, but turned it down for fear of being tied into a restrictive, long-term contract, which is common in American television production.\n\nThe female Rimmer in the Series II episode \"Parallel Universe\" was played by Suzanne Bertish, an actress primarily known for her classical stage work. She had been asked by director Ed Bye to play the part. \"Young Rimmer\", who had minor speaking roles in three episodes in Series III and IV, was played by child actor Simon Gaffney. Series X episode \"The Beginning\" features another \"Young Rimmer\", this time at college on Io, who was played by Philip Labey.\n\n"}
{"id": "179320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179320", "title": "Buddy Ebsen", "text": "Buddy Ebsen\n\nChristian Ludolf \"Buddy\" Ebsen Jr. (Also known as Frank \"Buddy\" Ebsen; April 2, 1908 – July 6, 2003) was an American actor and dancer whose career spanned seven decades. His most famous role was as Jed Clampett in the CBS television sitcom \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" (1962–1971); afterwards he starred as the title character in the television detective drama \"Barnaby Jones\" (1973–1980).\n\nOriginally a dancer, Ebsen began his career in \"Broadway Melody of 1936.\" He also appeared as a dancer with child star Shirley Temple in \"Captain January\" (1936). Ebsen was the original choice for the role of the Tin Man The Wizard of Oz, but fell ill due to the aluminum dust in his makeup and was forced to drop out. He appeared with Maureen O'Hara in \"They Met in Argentina\" (1941) and June Havoc in \"Sing Your Worries Away\" (1942). In \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961), he portrayed Doc Golightly, the much older husband of Audrey Hepburn's character. Before his starring role in \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", Ebsen had a successful television career, the highlight of which was his role as Davy Crockett's sidekick, George Russell, in Walt Disney's \"Davy Crockett\" miniseries (1953–54).\n\nA middle child with four sisters, Buddy Ebsen was born as Christian Ludolf Ebsen Jr., on April 2, 1908, in Belleville, Illinois. His father, Christian Ludolf Ebsen Sr., was a Danish choreographer, who once owned a dance studio and was also a physical fitness advocate, before operating a natatorium for the local school district, and his mother, Frances (née Wendt), was a Baltic German (specifically, Latvian) painter. \n\nEbsen was raised in Belleville until the age of 10, when his family moved to Palm Beach County, Florida. In 1920, Ebsen and his family relocated to Orlando, Florida. Ebsen and his sisters learned to dance at a dance studio his father operated in Orlando.\n\nDuring his high school years, Ebsen became a member of John M. Cheney Chapter, Order of DeMolay. His involvement as a teenager led to his being recognized by DeMolay in adult life with the award of the Legion of Honor Degree, and later by induction into the DeMolay Alumni Hall of Fame.\n\nEbsen graduated from Orlando High School in 1926. Initially interested in a medical career, Ebsen attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, from 1926 to 1927, and then Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, from 1927 to 1928. Family financial problems caused by the collapse of the Florida land boom forced Ebsen to leave college at age 20.\n\nEbsen left Orlando in the summer of 1928 to try his luck as a dancer in New York City, arriving with only $26.75 in his pocket, and worked at a soda fountain shop. His sister Vilma Ebsen and he performed as a dance act in supper clubs and in vaudeville — they were known as \"The Baby Astaires\". On Broadway, the Ebsens appeared as members of the chorus in the musicals \"Whoopee\", \"Flying Colors\", and \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1934\". A rave review from New York columnist Walter Winchell, who saw them perform in Atlantic City, New Jersey, led to a booking at the Palace Theatre in New York City, the pinnacle of the vaudeville world.\n\nIn 1935, Ebsen and his sister were approached by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a screen test. They then signed a two-year contract, with a two-year option, for $1,500.00 per week each (). After relocating to Hollywood, the siblings made their film debuts in the 1935 film \"Broadway Melody of 1936\". This was to be Vilma's only film — a contract problem prevented her making other films and she soon retired from show business.\n\nEbsen went on to appear in numerous films, both musicals and nonmusicals, including the 1936 \"Born to Dance\", the 1936 \"Captain January\" (in which he danced with Shirley Temple), the 1938 \"Broadway Melody of 1938\" (with Judy Garland as his dance partner), and the 1938 \"The Girl of the Golden West\". Ebsen partnered with actresses Eleanor Powell and Frances Langford, among others, and also danced solo.\n\nEbsen was noted for his unusual, surreal dancing and singing style (for example, his contribution to the \"Swingin' the Jinx Away\" finale of \"Born to Dance\"). His abilities might have been a reason filmmaker Walt Disney chose Ebsen to be filmed dancing in front of a grid as an aid to animating Mickey Mouse's dancing in Disney's 1929 to 1939 Silly Symphonies animated short films.\n\nWhen Ebsen turned down studio head Louis B. Mayer's offer of an exclusive MGM contract, Mayer warned him that he would never work in Hollywood again. Nonetheless, MGM did cast Ebsen as the Scarecrow in its 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\". Ebsen then swapped roles with actor Ray Bolger, who was originally cast as the Tin Man. Bolger wanted to play the Scarecrow, and Ebsen did not object to the change. Ebsen had recorded all of his songs as the Tin Man, attended all the rehearsals, and began filming. However, he soon began experiencing body aches, muscle cramps and shortness of breath, eventually leading to a lengthy hospitalization. Doctors determined that Ebsen was suffering a reaction to the aluminum dust used in the Tin Man makeup and he was forced to leave the production.\n\nIn an interview included posthumously on the 2005 DVD release of \"The Wizard of Oz\", Ebsen recalled that the MGM studio heads did not believe he was ill until he was ordered back to the set, and was intercepted by an angry nurse. Ebsen was replaced by Jack Haley, with the makeup quickly changed to a safer aluminum paste. As noted in a documentary on the 2005 DVD, at the time, MGM did not publicize the true reason for Ebsen's departure; even Haley was not told until much later. Although Haley re-recorded most of Ebsen's vocals, Ebsen's Midwestern voice (as opposed to Haley's Bostonian accent), with the enunciated \"r\" in the word \"wizard\", can still be heard on the soundtrack during several reprises of the song \"We're Off to See the Wizard\". Ebsen's recording of the Tin Man's only solo song, \"If I Only Had a Heart\", still exists and is included on the two-CD Deluxe Edition of the film's soundtrack, while a still photo recreation of the sequence featuring shots of Ebsen as the Tin Man was included as an extra with all VHS and DVD releases of the film since 1989. For the rest of his life, Ebsen complained of breathing problems from his involvement in \"that damned movie\". Nonetheless, he outlived all of the major cast members of \"The Wizard of Oz\", living into the 21st century; Jerry Maren (1920–2018), described in various obituaries as the last surviving Munchkin, outlived Ebsen by nearly 15 years, and extras are still alive. Other Munchkins have outlived him as well.\n\nAfter recovering from the illness, Ebsen became embroiled in a contract dispute with MGM that left him idle for long periods. He took up sailing, eventually becoming so proficient in seamanship that he taught the subject to United States Navy officer candidates. In 1941, with the start of U.S. involvement in World War II, Ebsen applied several times for an officer's commission in the Navy, but was repeatedly turned down. His application for a United States Coast Guard commission was accepted, and he was promptly given the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade. This wartime rank was one step up from the rank of Ensign, the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. Ebsen served as damage control officer and later as executive officer on the Coast Guard-manned Navy frigate , which recorded weather at its \"weather station\" 1,500 miles west of Seattle, Washington. These patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at Seattle. Ebsen was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard as a lieutenant in 1946.\n\nEbsen made his television debut on an episode of \"The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre\" in 1949. This led to television appearances in: \"Stars Over Hollywood\", \"Gruen Guild Playhouse\", four episodes of \"Broadway Television Theatre\", \"Schlitz Playhouse of Stars\", \"Corky and White Shadow\", the H.J. Heinz Company's \"Studio 57\", \"Screen Directors Playhouse\", two episodes of \"Climax!\", \"Tales of Wells Fargo\", \"The Martha Raye Show\", \"Playhouse 90\", \"Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse\", \"Johnny Ringo\", two episodes of \"Bonanza\", three episodes of \"Maverick\" (in which he portrayed assorted homicidal villains), and \"77 Sunset Strip\". Ebsen received wide television exposure when he played Georgie Russel, a role based on a historical person and companion to frontiersman Davy Crockett, in the \"Disneyland\" television miniseries \"Davy Crockett\" (1954–1955).\n\nIn the 1958–1959 season, Ebsen co-starred in the 26-episode half-hour NBC television adventure series \"Northwest Passage\". This series was a fictionalized account of Major Robert Rogers, a colonial American fighter for the British in the French and Indian War. Ebsen played the role of Sergeant Hunk Marriner; Keith Larsen played Rogers.\n\nIn 1960, Ebsen appeared in episodes of the television series \"Rawhide\", in the episodes \"The Pitchwagon\" and \"Tales of Wells Fargo\", which he reprised in episodes of both series during 1962 in the roles of different characters. Also in 1960, Ebsen played in season 4 episode 30 of \"Have Gun, Will Travel\" called \"El Paso Stage\", as a corrupt marshal.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1962, Ebsen had a recurring role as Virge Blessing in the ABC drama series \"Bus Stop\", the story of travelers passing through the bus station and diner in the fictitious town of Sunrise, Colorado. Robert Altman directed several episodes. Arthur O'Connell had played Virge Blessing in the earlier film version on which the series was loosely based. Ebsen also appeared as \"Mr. Dave\" Browne, a homeless hobo, on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" opposite Ron Howard, and as Jimbo Cobb in\" The Twilight Zone \"episode \"The Prime Mover\" (season 2, episode 21) in 1961.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Ebsen performed in films, mainly Westerns. One notable exception was an acclaimed role as Doc Golightly, an older, rural veterinarian deserted by his young wife (played by Audrey Hepburn) in 1961's \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\".\n\nPaul Henning recalls his reason for choosing Ebsen to play Clampett: \"I had seen him on TV and I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the role,\" he says. \"I was fortunate to have him, because he became the cornerstone of the show.\"\n\nEbsen became famous as Jed Clampett, an easygoing backwoods mountaineer who strikes oil and moves with his family to Beverly Hills, California, in the long-running, fish-out-of-water CBS sitcom \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". Aside from the top-billed Ebsen, principal cast members included Irene Ryan as Jed's mother-in-law, Daisy Moses, also known as Granny; Max Baer Jr. as Jed's dimwitted nephew Jethro Bodine; Donna Douglas as Jed's only child, the curvaceous, critter-loving Elly May Clampett; Raymond Bailey as Milburn Drysdale, a bank president who oversees the Clampett fortune; and Nancy Kulp as Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's secretary.\n\nAlthough scorned by critics, \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television. The show also spawned similar Paul Henning-produced rural sitcoms such as \"Green Acres\" and \"Petticoat Junction\", which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs. \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" was still earning good ratings when it was cancelled by CBS (because programmers began shunning shows that attracted a rural audience). One episode, \"The Giant Jack Rabbit\", was the highest-rated half-hour on television to that time and remains the most-watched half-hour sitcom episode.\n\nNot all was harmonious among cast members on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" set, especially between the politically conservative Ebsen and the more liberal Kulp. Said Douglas, \"They had a different view, so they had some heated discussions about that. They would go at it for weeks.\" In 1984, Kulp unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from Pennsylvania. To her dismay, Ebsen supported her Republican opponent, incumbent Representative Bud Shuster, going so far as to tape an ad for Shuster that labeled Kulp as \"too liberal\". Ebsen claimed she was exploiting her celebrity status and did not know the issues.\n\nEbsen returned to television in 1973 as the title character of \"Barnaby Jones\", which proved to be his second long-running television series. Barnaby Jones was a milk-drinking detective who came out of retirement to investigate the death of his son. Critics and CBS executives ridiculed the age of the show's audience, but it lasted 8 seasons and 178 episodes. When \"Barnaby Jones\" was cancelled, it was one of the last surviving 1970s detective dramas. Lee Meriwether, 1955 Miss America, played Barnaby's widowed daughter-in-law, Betty Jones. Ebsen appeared briefly as Barnaby Jones on two other productions: a 1975 episode of \"Cannon\" and the 1993 film \"The Beverly Hillbillies\".\n\nMeriwether said of her on and off screen chemistry with Ebsen, \"He really worked at being at the top of his game.\" \"You had to keep up with him.

We had CSI-type equipment in the office on the set and he liked doing his own tests. It was a show the whole family could watch.\"\n\nEbsen's last regular television series was \"Matt Houston\" on ABC, starring Lee Horsley. Ebsen played Matt's uncle, Roy Houston, during the show's third season from 1984 to 1985. He also appeared in \"The Waiting Room\", a\" Night Gallery \"segment that originally aired January 26, 1972.\n\nEbsen narrated the documentary series \"Disney Family Album\" during the 1980s on the Disney Channel and Steven Kellogg's \"Paul Bunyan\" on the PBS series \"Reading Rainbow\" in 1985. He made his final guest-starring appearance in 1994 on an episode of the short-lived television series revival \"Burke's Law\".\n\nAlthough generally retired from acting as he entered his 80s, Ebsen filmed a cameo in the 1993 film version of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" as Barnaby Jones. This was Ebsen's final motion picture role. In 1999, Ebsen provided the voice of Chet Elderson for an episode of the Fox Entertainment program \"King of the Hill\". This was his last TV appearance.\n\nEbsen has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1765 Vine Street, and a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nEbsen died of respiratory failure at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California, on July 6, 2003, at the age of 95. Upon his death, his body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nEbsen was first married to Ruth Cambridge and they had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce.\n\nIn 1945, Ebsen married fellow lieutenant Nancy Wolcott. They had four daughters, including Kiki Ebsen, and a son. This marriage, after 39 years, also ended in divorce.\n\nIn 1985, Ebsen married his third wife, Dorothy \"Dotti\" Knott. They had no children.\n\nThroughout his life, Ebsen had many interests. He became a folk artist and an avid coin collector, co-founding the Beverly Hills Coin Club in 1987 with actor Chris Aable. Ebsen's collection included many rarities such as a four-dollar gold piece worth $200,000. The coin was sold in several auctions both before and after his death. As Ebsen entered his nineties, he continued to keep active, and two years before his death, his bestselling novel \"Kelly's Quest\" was published. Ebsen wrote several other books including \"Polynesian Concept\" (about sailing), \"The Other Side of Oz\" (autobiography) and \"Sizzling Cold Case\", a mystery based on his Barnaby Jones character.\n\n\n\n"}

Olson, who ran in the 2016 United States presidential election. His form to run for office was filed with the Federal Election Commission in late July 2015. In polls conducted by Public Policy Polling in Iowa, Minnesota and North Carolina in mid-August 2015, he polled at 8, 8 and 9 percent respectively, garnering the attention of the media. On October 11, 2015, Deez Nuts announced on his Facebook page his intention to run for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, citing his eligibility despite not being a member of the House itself and the scarcity of candidates. A poll performed in mid-August 2016 shows Deez Nuts slightly edging out Harambe and Jill Stein in Texas, with 3% of the vote.\n\nNuts' bid for the presidency drew attention to the number of questionable candidates who had filed to run for office. Jim Williams, an analyst at Public Policy Polling, the organization that had conducted the poll in North Carolina, noted to \"The Guardian\" that, due to a fringe of the population with a penchant towards anti-establishment candidates, \"You could call [the third party candidate] anything, and they would get their 7% or 8%.\"\n\nIt was revealed on August 19, 2015, that \"Deez Nuts\" is 15-year-old Brady C. Olson of Wallingford, Iowa. He stated, in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, that he created the practical joke \"half-trying to break the two-party system, half-frustration with the front-runners.\" In addition, Olson also endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination, and Ohio Governor John Kasich for the Republican nomination. Olson, according to Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution, does not meet the minimum age requirement of 35 years at the time of inauguration to be able to serve as president if elected following the 2016 elections.\n\nIn August 2016, the Federal Election Commission announced its intent to punish future satirical candidates for president for false filings with a federal agency.\n\nBrady Olson, the person behind Deez Nuts, has expressed libertarian views.\n\nDeez Nuts believes that Congress should not be able to spend more than it takes in through taxes. In order to reinforce the importance of a balanced budget, Nuts believes that, in the short term, Congress, the President, and the Cabinet should have their salaries slashed in half until the budget is balanced, after which the salaries may slowly rise until they normalize. Nuts believes the salaries should be cut once again if the budget becomes unbalanced.\n\nNuts also believes that tax incentives are crucial to offer to corporations in order to keep jobs in the United States, as opposed to outsourcing. Nuts envisions a more self-sufficient United States in the future, not reliant on foreign imports.\n\nNuts supports cutting subsidies to oil companies and giving tax incentives to individuals and corporations implementing renewable energy and \"green\" technology—in particular, he supports grants to communities installing municipal wind turbines, hydroelectric dams, and rooftop solar panels. Nuts has not yet expressed an opinion on nuclear power.\n\nHe considers all adult illegal immigrants violators of the law, believing they should be deported to their country of origin. He has added that the lone exception to this is minors; however, he has not stated the punishment to minors, or the minor's family.\n\nDeez Nuts is opposed to the belief that the United States is a Christian nation, and believes in legal abortion and same-sex marriage on the basis that each person should be allowed to make his or her own decisions.\n\nDeez Nuts believes that residents of American overseas territories deserve voting rights. He has expressed the need for the people of American Samoa to become citizens of the United States and receive one electoral vote, due to its status as an unincorporated territory (American Samoans are currently U.S. nationals, but not U.S. citizens). Nuts would give Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands two electoral votes and give Puerto Rico three electoral votes, bringing the total number of electoral votes to 548 from 538. Nuts also believes that all five territories and the District of Columbia should each have their own one voting representation (as opposed to a non-voting delegates) in the House of Representatives, bringing the seats in the House to 441 from 435.\n\nDeez Nuts was endorsed by the man behind the original 'Deez Nuts' skit, hip-hop artist Warren G. Ice T also endorsed Deez Nuts.\n\nDeez Nuts endorsed Bernie Sanders and John Kasich for the respective 2016 Democratic and Republican presidential nominations.\n\nDeez Nuts first gained media attention from being included in a Public Policy Polling survey as a joke.\n"}

Lyman) of a multi-charge gun which was intended to increase muzzle velocity by detonating additional propellant charges behind the projectile or shell as it moved up the gun's barrel and was a distant ancestor of the World War II German V-3 \"supergun\".\n\nIn 1854 Haskell began experiments with steel breech-loading rifled cannon and breech-loading small-arms, manufacturing 25 of the former, which were purchased by the Mexican Government.\n\nIn 1855 he began experimenting with multi-charge guns in partnership with Azel S. Lyman, who originated the idea of applying successive charges of gunpowder to accelerate the velocity of a projectile.\n\nIn 1862, with a French inventor named George Raphael (sometimes reported as Rafael), a supplier of revolvers and swords to the Union army, Haskell invented and constructed a rapid-firing machine gun which became known as the Rafael Repeater. It was mounted on a light artillery carriage and fired standard rifle bullets. Unlike contemporary machine-guns, it did not use a feed hopper or separate cartridge chambers. However, few details remain of how it worked, apart from a mention in a letter from John Ericsson:\n\nRafael secured a meeting with Abraham Lincoln thanks to a letter of introduction from New York governor Edwin D. Morgan and in turn Lincoln arranged that the gun be tested by John A. Dahlgren who did so at the Navy Yard, discovering that the gun's range and accuracy were remarkable. At a range of , the lateral deviation was described as \"very slight\", and \"nearly all\" of 16 shots fired at a target at were hits. As far as rate of fire went, the gun fired 40 shots in 20 seconds. John Ericsson was impressed, and wrote to Lincoln that\n\nThe Repeater was tested in April 1863 at the 6th Corps headquarters in Virginia and was praised by a board composed of two Brigadier-Generals and a Colonel. In their report they stated that they found its simple construction, accuracy, range and rate of fire exactly as had been claimed for it and recommended that initially eight to twelve guns be used per brigade. Brigadier General Pratt, whose experience in action with the Gatling gun had not been satisfactory, endorsed the Rafael Repeater in glowing terms and asked that at least 24 of them be issued to his division.\n\nAfter reading the report, Abraham Lincoln asked the Secretary of War to refer it to the Bureau of Ordnance. However, General James Wolfe Ripley, who was notorious for delaying the introduction of repeating rifles, did not buy a single example of the gun.\n\nHaskell and Lyman reasoned that subsidiary propellant charges, spaced at intervals up the barrel of a gun in side chambers and ignited an instant after a shell had passed them, could increase the muzzle velocity of a projectile. The result, the \"Lyman-Haskell multi-charge gun\", which they constructed on the instructions of the US Army's Chief of Ordnance, did not resemble a conventional artillery piece; the barrel was so long that it had to be laid on an inclined ramp, and it had pairs of chambers angled back at 45 degrees let into it. It was test fired at the Frankfort Arsenal at Philadelphia in 1880 and was unsuccessful; due to faulty obturation, the flash from the original propellant charge bypassed the projectile and prematurely ignited the subsidiary charges. The best velocity that could be obtained from it was , much worse than a conventional Armstrong Gun of the same period. Lyman and Haskell abandoned the idea, though it was apparently briefly raised again in Britain during World War I.\n\nColonel Haskell died at his home in Passaic, New Jersey on August 16, 1897.\n\n"}

He was educated at the private Bracondale School between the ages of eight and seventeen, during which time he played cricket at weekends and was coached by former cricketer C. S. R. Boswell.\n\nEdrich played for Surrey and England. He was renowned for playing the cut, the cover drive and scoring off his legs, earning over the years a reputation for dogged fearlessness. His statistical achievements show that he was amongst the best players of his generation, playing a total of seventy-seven Test matches for England between 1963 and 1976, and scoring a triple-century in 1965 that is the fifth highest Test score for England.\n\nA player during the time when One Day International cricket was in its infancy, he played, and top scored, in the first ever ODI match. The cricket writer Colin Bateman described him as \"unflinching, unselfish, and often unsmiling while going about his business in the middle, he was a fiercely formidable opener who knew his limitations and worked wonderfully within them\".\n\nHaving played four first-class matches for Combined Services in 1956 and 1957, whilst doing his national service, Edrich made his first-class debut for Surrey in their final fixture of the 1958 season. The following year, he came to the fore, scoring 1,799 runs at an average of 52.91. Over the next four years he and Micky Stewart became a very effective opening partnership for the county, to the extent that both were called up for England for the Test series against the West Indies, who were dominating the sport at this time. Despite Edrich's strong performances for his county, he managed a total of only 108 Test runs in six innings facing bowlers including Hall, Sobers and Griffith.\n\nHowever, an opportunity to break back into the international side arose when Geoffrey Boycott was injured during Australia's tour of England in 1964. Edrich was called up to the side for the Second Test, at Lord's, and did not disappoint, scoring 120. The match ended in a draw due to rain. However, he was not selected for the 1964–65 tour of South Africa.\n\nInjuries to other players resulted in another recall to the England side for the Third Test against New Zealand at Headingley in July 1965, where he scored 310 not out. This innings spanned over eight hours, and included 52 fours and five sixes – 238 runs or 77% of his innings. Commentators at the time said that he might have broken the existing Test record of 365 within another 90 minutes or so if his captain, Mike Smith, had not felt it necessary to declare the innings closed. However, a week later during the First Test against South Africa, he suffered a blow to the head from a short-pitched delivery by Peter Pollock. This was before helmets came into use, and he was forced to retire hurt on 7 not out.\nWisden named Edrich as Cricketer of the Year in 1966 for his achievements in 1965, alongside Colin Bland, Dick Motz, Graeme Pollock and brother Peter Pollock. As well as his Test triple century, he had scored a total of 2,319 runs at an average of 62.67 during the season, including eight hundreds. At one stage, in nine successive innings he scored 139, 121*, 205*, 55, 96, 188, 92, 105 and 310*. Not previously known as a big hitter, he struck forty-nine sixes during the course of the season.\nHe had by now become an established member of the England batting line-up, rarely omitted unless injured. Beginning with the 1965–66 Ashes series, he sometimes batted at number three rather than, as hitherto, opening the innings. In the 1970–71 Ashes series his 687 runs (52.85) kept him at the crease for 33 hours and 26 minutes, a record for a Test series until broken by Glenn Turner against West Indies the next season. His form at this time helped England play 27 consecutive Tests without defeat in 1968–71, and lose only one Test out of 40 in 1966–71.\n\nEdrich played in the first-ever One Day International (ODI), on 5 January 1971 against Australia. After the Third Test had been called off due to rain, the umpires called for an unscheduled match, consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Edrich top-scored with 82 runs, thus scoring the first half-century in an ODI, and won the first Man of the Match award in ODI history.\n\nThe following summer, Surrey won the County Championship for the first time since 1958, with Edrich's batting being an important factor in the county's success. By now, Stewart had dropped down the order to number three, and Edrich had formed another successful opening partnership with Mike Edwards. Stewart retired after the 1972 season, and from 1973 to 1977 Edrich succeeded him as Surrey's captain.\n\nOn the tour of Australia in 1974–75, his fortune regarding injuries did not improve. In the first Test a ball from aggressive pace bowler Dennis Lillee struck his hand and broke it, although he was able to continue batting. In the Fourth Test, the then captain Mike Denness dropped himself and Edrich was subsequently named as captain. He had little luck in that game when Lillee broke his ribs with the first ball of his second innings, although he did recover to bat later on, scoring 33 runs. England lost the test, and it was to be his only appearance as captain.\n\nDuring the 1977 county cricket season, Edrich scored his 100th first-class century, playing for Surrey against Derbyshire. In the same year he was appointed an MBE for services to cricket. Edrich finished his first-class career in 1978, having scored 39,790 runs. He became a Test selector in 1981.\n\nIn 1995 he was named as England's batting coach. In the summer of 2000, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of incurable leukaemia known as Waldenstrom's, and he was told that he had seven years to live. In an interview with \"The Independent\", following his diagnosis, Edrich said:\n\nIn 2006–07 he served as President of Surrey County Cricket Club. In 2012 he said he had been cured of cancer by a course of injections of mistletoe extract, and was fit and active again. He now lives in Aberdeenshire.\n\n"}
{"id": "4087048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4087048", "title": "John G. Lake", "text": "John G. Lake\n\nJohn Graham Lake (March 18, 1870 – September 16, 1935) was a Canadian-American leader in the Pentecostal movement that began in the early 20th century, and is known as a faith healer, missionary, and with Thomas Hezmalhalch, co-founder of the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa. Through his 1908–13 African missionary work, Lake played a decisive role in the spread of Pentecostalism in South Africa, the most successful southern African religious movement of the 20th century. After completing his missionary work in Africa, Lake evangelized for 20 years, primarily along the west coast of the United States setting up \"healing rooms\" and healing campaigns, and establishing churches. Lake was influenced by the healing ministry of John Alexander Dowie and the ministry of Charles Parham.\n\nLake was born in St. Mary's, Ontario, Canada and moved to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan with his family in 1886. He was born into a large family of 16 siblings (eight of whom died young). He graduated from high school in St Mary's shortly before the move to Michigan, and claimed to have been ordained into the Methodist ministry at the age of twenty-one. The seminary he claimed to have attended, though, never existed, and census records show he had less than ten years' education. Lake, then, had no formal theological training.\n\nLake moved to a suburb of Chicago, Harvey, in 1890, where he worked as a roofer and construction worker before returning to his hometown in 1896. According to Lake, he became an industrious businessman and started two newspapers, the \"Harvey Citizen\" in Harvey, Illinois and the \"Soo Times\" in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, before beginning a successful career in real estate, and later, becoming a millionaire in life insurance dealings. Historian Barry Morton found no evidence that Lake ever owned the two newspapers, citing sources which indicate the \"Harvey Citizen\" was founded by the Harvey township, and the \"Soo Times\" was started by George A. Ferris and owned by Ferris & Scott Publishers. Morton further alleges that Lake exaggerated his business career, and that \"clear evidence\" shows Lake instead worked as a small-scale contractor, roofer and \"house-flipper\". In the 1900 Census, Lake's occupation is listed as \"carpenter\". \nIn February 1893, Lake married Jennie Stevens of Newberry, Michigan, and the two had six children and adopted another before her death in 1908. During the 1890s Lake and many members of his family began appearing regularly in Dowie's services, where they were invariably healed and allegedly brought back from death's door. In 1898 Lake opened a small chapter of Dowie's Christian Catholic Church in Sault Ste Marie and held meetings in the attic of his parents' home. In 1901 he relocated his family to Zion, Illinois, where he worked in the theocratic town's construction department.\n\nAfter massive retrenchments affected ever-bankrupt Zion City, Lake found new employment around 1905. He later claimed that he maintained relationships with many of the leading figures of his day including railroad tycoon James Jerome Hill, Cecil Rhodes, Mahatma Gandhi, Arthur Conan Doyle, and others. When he began his preaching career he claimed to have walked away from a $50,000 year salary (around $1.25 million in 2007 US dollars), as well as his seat on the Chicago Board of Trade. Lake's biographer, Burpeau, reported no evidence outside of Lake's own assertions that Lake was connected to these wealthy financiers and industrialists. According to Morton, contemporary records show Lake never left Zion City at the time Lake was said to be making his name in Chicago; he instead worked in nearby Waukegan as an \"ordinary, small-town insurance salesman\". Lake does not appear in contemporary newspapers until 1907 where he gave an account of his experience of speaking in tongues.\nIn 1907 Lake was converted to Pentecostalism when Charles Parham staged a tent revival in Zion in an attempt to woo Dowie's supporters. After Parham's departure a group of several hundred \"Parhamites\" remained in Zion, led by Thomas Hezmalhalch—a recent arrival from the Azusa Street Revival. As 1907 wore on, Lake grew in stature among this group, and was usually listed as co-leader. After Parham's arrest for (unsubstantiated) reports of sodomy and pedophilia in the summer of 1907, the Parhamites descended into disorganization. Believing that many had been possessed by demons, a number of brutal exorcisms began, in which at least two deaths occurred. In the face of arrests and potential mob violence, the Parhamites were forced to flee en masse from Illinois. Lake and Hezmalhalch left for Indianapolis. Once there, they raised $2000 to finance a Pentecostal mission to South Africa.\n\nWith Thomas Hezmalhalch, Lake founded the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa (AFM) in 1908 and carried on missionary work from 1908-13. Lake and Hezmalhalch would appear to be the first Pentecostal missionaries to South Africa, and introduced speaking in tongues. Many of those who joined their church had previously been Zionists allied to Dowie's organization who believed in faith healing. Morton writes, \"Lake was instrumental in spreading this fusion of Zionism/Pentecotalismas that is unique to southern Africa... about half of southern African Christians today [2012] are adherents of it... Lake played a decisive role in the spreading of this 'second evangelization'.\" Lake's movement attracted many of the early Zionists led by Pieter L. Le Roux of Wakkerstroom. Due to the segregationist impulses of the AFM's white membership, the majority of its African members eventually seceded, forming many different Zionist Christian sects.\n\nJust six months after Lake's arrival in South Africa, his first wife, Jennie, died on December 22, 1908. Lake recorded that she died of a stroke. He continued his work in Africa for another four years, raising his seven children with the help of his sister Irene.\n\nLake's ministry in South Africa was not without controversy. Morton wrote that Lake was accused of: misappropriating the AFM's funds, particularly that funds did not flow to poor rural areas but were concentrated with Lake and his party; acting dictatorially; exaggerating the effectiveness of the revival movement he led; and staging miraculous healings through audience plants. He also wrote that \"an analysis of the missionary career of John G Lake shows that the initial spread of Pentecostalism and Zionism in southern Africa was facilitated by the systematic use of fraud and deception.\" \n\nLake returned to America on February 1, 1913, and married Florence Switzer in November 1913. Lake's comment on this second marriage was, \"Men in these days consider themselves to be happily married once. I have been especially blessed in that I have been happily married twice.\" From this marriage five children were born.\n\nAfter a year of itinerant preaching, Lake relocated to Spokane, WA by July 1914 and began ministering in \"The Church of Truth\". He started an organization called The Divine Healing Institute and opened what he called \"Lake's Divine Healing Rooms\". Lake ran the \"healing rooms\" from 1915 until May 1920, at which time he moved to Portland, Oregon, for a similar ministry that lasted for another five years. He continued to found churches and \"healing rooms\" down the California coast and eventually to Houston, TX in 1927, before finally returning to Spokane in 1931. Upon his return to Spokane he purchased an old church and began his final church and healing room.\n\nIn 1935, Lake suffered a serious stroke and died on September 16, 1935, at age 65.\n\nSeveral books have been written recording Lake's experiences and the miracles attributed to Lake.\n\nLake's history has served as a guide to other ministries, such as Curry R. Blake's \"John G. Lake Ministries,\" based in Dallas, TX, (www.jglm.org) and Healing Rooms Ministries, led by Cal Pierce, headquartered in Spokane, Washington.\n\nIn 1987, Wilford Reidt (the son-in-law of Lake) and his wife, Gertrude (Lake's daughter) passed the leadership of their ministry to Curry R. Blake. Blake was named the General Overseer of the International Apostolic Council, an organization founded by John G. Lake in 1914. Today, the ministry establishes \"John G. Lake Healing Rooms\" and trains Christians in divine healing.\n\nIn 1999, the Healing Rooms in Spokane, Washington were opened, which are not affiliated with John G. Lake Ministries. The Healing Rooms place an emphasis on not only serving the city of Spokane, but in duplicating the ministry of healing globally, with currently 2,002 Healing Rooms in 58 nations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21830463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21830463", "title": "John Rutledge", "text": "John Rutledge\n\nJohn Rutledge (September 17, 1739 – July 23, 1800) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and also its second Chief Justice. Additionally, he served as the first Governor of South Carolina after the Declaration of Independence.\n\nBorn in Charleston, South Carolina, Rutledge established a legal career after studying at Middle Temple in the City of London. He was the elder brother of Edward Rutledge, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Rutledge served as a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, which protested taxes imposed on the Thirteen Colonies by the Parliament of Great Britain. He also served as a delegate to the Continental Congress before being elected as Governor of South Carolina. He served as governor during much of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAfter briefly returning to Congress, Rutledge was appointed to the South Carolina Court of Chancery. He was a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, which wrote the United States Constitution. During the convention, he served as Chairman of the Committee of Detail, which produced the first full draft of the Constitution. The following year he also participated in the South Carolina convention to ratify Constitution.\n\nIn 1789, President George Washington appointed Rutledge as one of the inaugural Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Rutledge left the Supreme Court in 1791 to become Chief Justice of the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas and Sessions. He returned to the Supreme Court, this time as Chief Justice, following the resignation of John Jay in June 1795. As the vacancy came during a long Senate recess, Washington named Rutledge as the new chief justice by a recess appointment. When the Senate reconvened in December 1795, it rejected Rutledge's nomination by a 10–14 vote. Rutledge resigned his commission shortly thereafter, and withdrew from public life until his death in 1800. He holds the record for the shortest tenure of any Chief Justice. His was the first Supreme Court nomination to be rejected by the Senate, and he remains the only \"recess appointed\" justice not to be subsequently confirmed by the Senate.\n\nRutledge was the eldest child in a large family in Charleston, South Carolina. His father was Scotch-Irish immigrant John Rutledge (Sr.) (1713–1750), the physician. His mother, South Carolina–born Sarah (\"née\" Hext; born September 18, 1724), was of English descent. John had six younger siblings: Andrew (1740–1772), Thomas (1741–1783), Sarah (1742–1819), Hugh (1745–1811), Mary (1747–1832), and Edward (1749–1800). John's early education was provided by his father until the latter's death. The rest of Rutledge's primary education was provided by an Anglican priest.\n\nJohn took an early interest in law and often \"played lawyer\" with his brothers and sisters. When he was 17 years old, Rutledge began to read law under a man named James Parsons. Two years later, Rutledge sailed to England to further his studies at London's Middle Temple. In the course of his studies, he won several cases in English courts.\n\nAfter finishing his studies, Rutledge returned to Charleston to begin a fruitful legal career. At the time, many new lawyers barely scraped together enough business to earn their livings. Most new lawyers could only hope that they would win well-known cases to ensure their success. Rutledge, however, emerged almost immediately as one of the most prominent lawyers in Charleston, and his services were in high demand.\n\nWith his successful legal career, he was able to build on his mother's fortune. On May 1, 1763, Rutledge married Elizabeth Grimké (born 1742). Rutledge was very devoted to his wife, and Elizabeth's death on July 6, 1792, was a major cause of the illness that affected Rutledge in his later years.\n\nJohn and Elizabeth had 10 children: Martha Henrietta (1764–1816), Sarah (born and died 1765), John (1766–1819), Edward James (1767–1811), Frederick Wilkes (1769–1821), William Spencer (1771–1821), Charles Wilson (1773–1821), Thomas (born 1774 and died young), Elizabeth (1776–1842), and States Whitcomb (1783–1829).\n\nIn mid-1765 Rutledge was an important figure in the Stamp Act Congress. This congress produced a resolution that stated that it was \"the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on them but with their own consent, given personally, or by their representatives.\" Rutledge chaired a committee that drew up a petition to the House of Lords attempting to persuade them to reject the Stamp Act. They were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nWhen the delegates returned to South Carolina after the Congress adjourned, they found the state in turmoil. The people had destroyed all the revenue stamps they could find; they broke into the houses of suspected Loyalists to search for stamps. When the Stamp Act went into effect on November 1, 1765, there were no stamps in the entire colony. Dougal Campbell, the Charleston court clerk, refused to issue any papers without the stamps. Because of this, all legal processes in the entire state came to a standstill until news that the Stamp Act had been repealed reached South Carolina in early May 1766.\n\nAfter the Stamp Act conflict ended, Rutledge went back into private life, and to his law practice. Besides serving in the colonial legislature, he did not involve himself in politics. His law practice continued to expand and he became fairly wealthy as a result.\n\nIn 1774, Rutledge was elected to the First Continental Congress. It is not known for certain exactly what John Rutledge did in the Congress. The records of the Congress refer only to \"Rutledge\", though both John and his brother Edward Rutledge were present. The most important contribution made by \"Rutledge\" to the Congress was during the debate on how to apportion votes in the Congress. Some wanted votes to be apportioned by the population of the colonies. Others wanted to give each colony one vote. \"Rutledge\" observed that as the Congress had no legal authority to \"force\" the colonies to accept its decisions, it would make the most sense to give each colony one vote. The other delegates ultimately agreed to this proposal.\n\nJohn Rutledge served in the First Continental Congress and the Second Continental Congress until 1776. That year, he was elected President of South Carolina under a constitution drawn up on March 26, 1776. Upon taking office, he worked quickly to organize the new government and to prepare defenses against British attack.\n\nIn early 1776, Rutledge learned that British forces would attempt to take Charleston. In response, he ordered the construction of Fort Sullivan (now Fort Moultrie) on Sullivan's Island in Charleston Harbor. When the British arrived, the fort was only half completed. General Charles Lee of the Continental Army, who had arrived a few days earlier with reinforcements from North Carolina, told Rutledge the fort should be evacuated, as Lee considered it indefensible. Lee said that the fort would fall in under a half an hour, and all the men would be killed. In a note to the fort's commanding officer, Colonel William Moultrie, Rutledge wrote \"General Lee ... wishes you to evacuate the fort. You will not, without [an] order from me. I would sooner cut off my hand than write one.\" Rutledge, noticed that Lee was arrogant and uncouth and unfit to control the militia. Rutledge, by virtue of being elected by the state gained control of the militia. Rutledge let it be known that only he could order the militia to defend Charleston. During this time, Rutledge garnered the nickname \"Dictator John\" by virtue of getting his way with things.\n\nOn June 28, 1776, the British attacked the fort, expecting it to fall quickly. However, the fort's walls were made out of palmetto logs packed with sand, and the British cannonballs were absorbed into the soft core of the logs without doing much damage, and the British were repulsed, saving Charleston. The battle anniversary is still celebrated as \"Carolina Day\", on June 28 each year. South Carolina's current \"Palmetto Flag\", adopted in 1861, features the crescent symbol on the defending soldiers' caps along with the Palmetto tree.\n\nRutledge continued as President of South Carolina until 1778. That year, the South Carolina legislature proposed a new constitution. Rutledge vetoed it, stating that it moved the state dangerously close to a direct democracy, which Rutledge believed was only a step away from total anarchy. When the legislature overrode his veto, Rutledge resigned.\n\nA few months after Rutledge's resignation, the British, having suffered several defeats in the North, decided to try to retake the South. Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell landed in Georgia with 3,000 men and quickly took control of the entire state.\n\nThe new state constitution was revised, and in 1779, Rutledge was elected governor. While the first governor independent from Great Britain, Rutledge is considered by historians and the Government of South Carolina to be the 31st Governor, counting from the Colonial Governors. \"See: List of Governors of South Carolina.\" Rutledge sent troops under General Benjamin Lincoln into Georgia to harass the British. The new British commander in the south, General Jacques Prevost, responded by marching on Charleston with 2,500 troops. When Rutledge heard about this threat, he hurried to Charleston and worked furiously to build up defenses. In spite of Rutledge's efforts, when General Prevost arrived outside Charleston, the British force had been greatly increased by the addition of Loyalists, and the Americans were vastly outnumbered.\n\nRutledge privately asked Prevost for surrender terms. Prevost made an offer, but when Rutledge submitted it to the council of war, the council instructed Rutledge to ask if the British would accept a declaration of South Carolina's neutrality in the Revolution. They forbade Rutledge from surrendering mainly because William Moultrie, who was now a general, believed that the Americans had at least as many troops as the British force, which consisted largely of untrained civilians.\n\nPrevost replied that as he was faced with such a large military force, he would have to take some of them prisoner before he could accept. Moultrie advised the council that he would never stand by and allow the British to take Americans prisoner without fighting, so the council decided to fight it out. The city braced itself for an attack, but the next morning, the British had disappeared. Prevost had intercepted a letter from General Lincoln to Moultrie saying that he was marching to the aid of Charleston, and Prevost decided that he could not hold out if the Americans got reinforcements.\n\nIn early 1780, Sir Henry Clinton attacked South Carolina, and Charleston was thrown into a panic. The legislature adjourned upon learning of the British. Their last action was to give Rutledge power to do anything short of execution without trial. Rutledge did his best to raise militia forces, but Charleston was in the midst of a smallpox epidemic, and few dared to enter the city.\n\nIn February, Clinton landed near Charleston with 5,000 troops. By May he had 9,000 troops to less than 2,500 Americans in the area. The siege of Charleston ensued. On May 10, Charleston surrendered. Rutledge had left the city. He remained Governor of the unconquered part of South Carolina.\n\nThough the Americans defeated the British at the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781, they could not drive the British back to Charleston until June 1781, when General Nathanael Greene arrived with more troops. The British held Charleston until December 14, 1782. John Rutledge's term of office had already ended, and he did not run again, because of term limits.\n\nLike many prominent European-American men in South Carolina at the time, he owned African American people as slaves.\n\nAccording to the state library of South Carolina:\n\nAlthough Rutledge claimed that he disliked slavery, as an attorney he twice defended individuals who abused slaves. Before the American Revolution, Rutledge owned sixty slaves; afterward, he possessed twenty-eight. His wife Elizabeth manumitted her own slaves, and his nieces were abolitionists Sarah and Angelina Grimké. Despite this, Rutledge convinced the Constitutional Convention not to abolish slavery. When Rutledge died in 1800, he only owned one slave due to financial difficulties.\n\nIn 1784, the South Carolina legislature threatened to exile a tavern keeper by the name of William Thompson, for insulting \"Dictator\" John Rutledge, now the former governor and a prominent figure in the state. Rutledge had sent a female servant to Thompson's tavern to watch a fireworks display from the roof. Thompson denied the servant admittance and sent her back to Rutledge. Rutledge was furious and demanded that Thompson come to his house and apologize. Thompson refused and, believing that his honor had been affronted by Rutledge's arrogant request, challenged Rutledge to a duel. Since people like Rutledge did not associate with tavern keepers, Rutledge went to the South Carolina House of Representatives and insisted that it pass a bill banishing Thompson from the state for insulting a government official. Thompson claimed that, Rutledge and others who were wealthy composed \"the grand hierarchy of the State.\" Thompson argued that independent people required leaders who were \"good, able, useful and friends to social equality.\" This altercation changed the hierarchy of state legislatures for years to come.\n\nIn 1787, Rutledge was selected to represent South Carolina in the Philadelphia Convention which was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, but instead produced the United States Constitution. He attended all the sessions and served on five committees. At the Convention, Rutledge maintained a moderate nationalist stance and chaired the Committee of Detail. After the Convention had debated the Virginia Plan and settled some major points of controversy, the Committee of Detail, which Rutledge chaired, assembled during the convention's July 4 recess. Though the committee did not record its minutes, it is known that the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other sources, to produce the first full draft. Much of what was included in this draft consisted of details, such as powers given to Congress, that hadn't been debated by the Convention. Most of these were uncontroversial and unchallenged, and as such much of what Rutledge's committee included in this first draft made it into the final version of the Constitution without debate.\n\nRutledge recommended that the executive power should consist of a single person, rather than several, because he felt that one person would feel the responsibility of the office more acutely. Because the president would not be able to defer a decision to another \"co-president\", Rutledge concluded that a single person would be more likely to make a good choice. Rutledge was largely responsible for denying the Supreme Court the right to give advisory opinions. Being a judge himself, he strongly believed that a judge's sole purpose was to resolve legal conflicts; he held that a judge should hand down an opinion only when ruling on an actual case. He also thought that the legal community was the higher tier of society.\n\nRutledge also argued that if either house of the legislature was to have the sole authority to introduce appropriation bills, it should be the Senate. He noted that the Senate, by nature of its lengthier terms of office, would tend to be more leisurely in its actions. Because of this, Rutledge felt that the Senate would be better able to think clearly about what the consequences of a bill would be. Also, since the bills could not become law without the consent of the House of Representatives, he concluded that there would be no danger of the Senate ruling the country.\n\nWhen the proposal was made that only landowners should have the right to vote, Rutledge opposed it perhaps more strongly than any other motion in the entire convention. He stated that making such a rule would divide the people into \"haves\" and \"have nots\", would create an undying resentment against landowners, and could do nothing but cause discord. He was supported by Benjamin Franklin, and the rule was not adopted.\n\nIn the debate on slavery in the new country, Rutledge took the side of the slave-owners; he was a Southerner and he owned several slaves. Rutledge said that if the Constitution forbade slavery, the Southern states would never agree to the Constitution.\n\nOn September 24, 1789, George Washington nominated Rutledge for one of the five associate justice positions on the newly established Supreme Court. His appointment (along with those of: John Blair Jr., William Cushing, Robert H. Harrison, and James Wilson; plus that of John Jay for Chief Justice) was confirmed by the Senate two days later. His service on the Court officially began February 15, 1790, when he took the Judicial Oath, and continued until March 5, 1791. Rutledge resigned from the Supreme Court, without having ever heard a case, in order to become Chief Justice of the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas and Sessions.\n\nOn June 28, 1795, Chief Justice John Jay resigned, having been elected Governor of New York. Washington selected Rutledge to succeed Jay as Chief Justice, and, as the Senate would not be meeting again until December, gave Rutledge a recess appointment so that he could serve as Chief Justice during the upcoming August Session. He was commissioned as the second Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on June 30, 1795, and took the Judicial Oath on August 12.\n\nOn July 16, 1795, Rutledge gave a highly controversial speech denouncing the Jay Treaty with Great Britain. He reportedly said in the speech \"that he had rather the President should die than sign that puerile instrument\"– and that he \"preferred war to an adoption of it.\" Rutledge's speech against the Jay Treaty cost him the support of many in the Washington Administration, which supported the treaty, and in the Senate, which would soon be called upon to advise the President on his nomination of Rutledge to the judicial post and to consent to its ratification by a two-thirds vote.\n\nTwo cases were decided while Rutledge was chief justice. In \"United States v. Peters,\" the Court ruled that federal district courts had no jurisdiction over crimes committed against Americans in international waters. In \"Talbot v. Janson\", the Court held that a citizen of the United States did not waive all claims to U.S. citizenship by either renouncing citizenship of an individual state, or by becoming a citizen of another country. The Rutledge Court thus established an important precedent for multiple citizenship in the United States.\n\nBy the time of his formal nomination to the Court on December 10, 1795, Rutledge's reputation was in tatters and support for his nomination had faded. Rumors of mental illness and alcohol abuse swirled around him, concocted largely by the Federalist press. His words and actions in response to the Jay Treaty were used as evidence of his continued mental decline. The Senate rejected his appointment on December 15, 1795 by a vote of 14–10. This was the first time that the Senate had rejected a Supreme Court nomination. To date, it is the only Supreme Court recess appointment not to be subsequently confirmed, and Rutledge remains the only Supreme Court justice unseated involuntarily by the Senate.\n\nThe Senate's rejection of his nomination left Rutledge mentally ruined. On December 26, 1795, he attempted suicide by jumping off a wharf into Charleston Harbor. He was rescued by two slaves who saw him drowning. Though the Senate remained in session through June 1, 1796, which would have been the automatic end of Rutledge's tenure following the rejection, Rutledge resigned from the Court two days later, on December 28, 1795, having served the briefest tenure of any Chief Justice of the United States ().\n\nRegarding the Senate's rejection of Rutledge's nomination, then Vice President John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail that it \"gave me pain for an old friend, though I could not but think he deserved it. Chief Justices must not go to illegal Meetings and become popular orators in favor of Sedition, nor inflame the popular discontents which are ill founded, nor propagate Disunion, Division, Contention and delusion among the people.\"\n\nFollowing his disastrous speech on the Jay Treaty, Senate rejection, suicide attempt, and resignation from the Supreme Court, Rutledge withdrew from public life and returned to Charleston. He died on June 21, 1800, at the age of sixty. He was interred at St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Charleston. One of his houses, said to have been built in 1763 and definitely sold in 1790, was renovated in 1989 and opened to the public as the John Rutledge House Inn.\n\n\n\n"}

At age 15, she started her career in the fashion world, while taking piano lessons and attending school. Her breakthrough was at age 13 in a television commercial. She began her studies as a model at the Francina International Modeling Agency's School. She was later signed to the agency and began modeling for print. Her modeling pursuits led her to Japan and Italy mainly.\n\nMascó appeared in the 1990 \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\" as the cover model. She also appeared in the 1991, 1992, 1994, and 1995 editions.

She kept been the face of a variety of advertising campaigns including Natura Bissé, El Corte Inglés, Clairol, Lancaster, Trident, Fila, Clarins or Timotei. Mascó is also the only Spanish model (and with Penélope Cruz the only Spaniard woman) who has graced on the cover of US \"Vogue\". She has been featured in fashion spreads in most major fashion magazines including covers like French, Canadian, American, Spanish, Swedish and Italian \"Elle\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"Cleo\", \"Woman\", \"Glamour\", \"Marie Claire\", \"Sposabella\", \"Telva\", \"Ocean Drive\", \"New Woman\" or \"Amica\".\n\nMascó has worked with the most well-known photographers in the fashion industry in the 1990s, such as Hans Feurer, Gilles Bensimon, Ellen Von Unwerth, Bruce Weber, Oliviero Toscani, Steven Meisel, Fabrizio Ferri, Albert Watson or Patrick Demarchelier among others.\nAs a catwalk model she appeared in shows for major designers as Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino, Max Mara, Carolina Herrera, Escada, Sportmax, Byblos, Loewe or Anne Klein.\n\nMascó is regarded as one of the best Spanish models of the 1990s and still appears in print occasionally.

He was the founder of Mairé, or Mariacum, Abbey at Mairé-Levescault in Poitou, France and is the patron saint of Poitou ploughmen.\n\nHe was born at the beginning of the 6th century, in 500 or 501, in a in the area of \"Briosso\" (now called Briançais or Brioux) near or on an estate named \"Champagné\" which still exists (Champagné-le-Sec), and close to the village of Mairé in the commune of Perigné, Deux-Sèvres.\n\nHe was educated by his parents who were Gallo-Roman nobility. Although his name is undoubtedly of Pagan origin, coming from the Roman gods Juno/Jupiter, he was dedicated to the service of God from his earliest childhood and was instructed in all the sacred and human sciences which were taught at that time.\n\nNothing else is known about his early life but we re-encounter Junien as a young man living a life of austerity as a hermit in a place called Bois Trappeau in the commune of Ardilleux in Deux-Sèvres.\n\nJunian acquired disciples and in 559, King Clotaire I made him a gift of land on which to found a monastery dedicated to the rule of Saint Benoît - the religious community at Mairé-l'Evescault, south of Deux-Sèvres. This isolated place evoked memories of his childhood home and Junien named it \"Mariacus\" - subsequently \"Mairé\". The \"L'Evescault\" was added after a great religious festival in Poitiers to which Junien was invited by Queen Radagonde who raised him to the same rank as the other bishops or \"Les Evêques\" who were present. Hence the name Mairé-L'Evescault.\n\nHe remained a friend of Queen Radegund who herself founded the abbey of Sainte-Croix de Poitiers. Junian and Radegonde died on the same day, on August 13, 587. \nJunian's monastery at Mairé was partially destroyed during the wars of Pepin the Short and Charlemagne but survived for another thousand years. It was finally demolished during the French Revolution, the stone being re-used for local construction and the lands reverting to their farming origins.\n\n"}

He was a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress, and for six months served as the presiding officer of that body. He also attended the Constitutional Convention and was one of the signers of the United States Constitution on September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nGorham was born in Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts, and was the son of Captain Nathaniel Gorham and his father's wife Mary Soley. His 3rd great grandfather was John Howland (c. 1599–1673), who was one of the Pilgrims who traveled from England to North America on the \"Mayflower\", signed the Mayflower Compact, and helped found the Plymouth Colony. \nHis sister, Elizabeth Gorham, who married John Leighton, was the ancestor of Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt, the second wife of Theodore Roosevelt, who served as First Lady of the United States during his presidency from 1901 to 1909.\n\nHe married Rebecca Call, who was descended from Anglican vicar and the first minister of Dorchester, Massachusetts, John Maverick, and his royally descended wife, Mary Gye Maverick. Rev. John Maverick was born in Awliscombe, Devon, baptized there on December 28, 1578, and enrolled at Oxford October 24, 1595, age 18. He was the son of Rev. Peter Maverick (spelled Mavericke in old English records), the vicar of Awliscombe. on September 6, 1763, in Charlestown, Massachusetts. She was born on May 14, 1744, in Charlestown, and died there on November 18, 1812. She was the daughter of Caleb Call and Rebecca Stimson. They were the parents of nine children.\n\nStarting at 15, he served an apprenticeship with a merchant in New London, Connecticut, after which he opened a merchant house in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1759. He took part in public affairs at the beginning of the American Revolution: he was a member of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature) from 1771 until 1775, a delegate to the Provincial congress from 1774 until 1775, and a member of the Board of War from 1778 until its dissolution in 1781. In 1779 he served in the state constitutional convention. He was a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation from 1782 until 1783, and also from 1785 until 1787, serving as its president for five months from June 6 to November 5, 1786, after the resignation of John Hancock. Gorham also served a term as judge of the Middlesex County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nIn 1786 it might have been Gorham who suggested to Alexander Hamilton that Prince Henry of Prussia would become President or King of the United States. However, the offer was revoked before the prince could make a reply.\n\nFor several months in 1787, Gorham served as one of the Massachusetts delegates to the United States Constitutional Convention. Gorham frequently served as Chairman of the Convention's Committee of the Whole, meaning that he (rather than the President of the Convention, George Washington) presided over convention sessions during the delegates' first deliberations on the structure of the new government in late May and June 1787. After the convention, he worked hard to see that the Constitution was approved in his home state.\nIn connection with Oliver Phelps, he purchased from the state of Massachusetts in 1788 pre-emption rights to an immense tract of land in western New York State which straddled the Genesee River, all for the sum of $1,000,000 (about $ today) (the Phelps and Gorham Purchase). The land in question had been previously ceded to Massachusetts from the state of New York under the 1786 Treaty of Hartford. The pre-emption right gave them the first or preemptive right to obtain clear title to this land from the Indians. They soon extinguished the Indian title to the portion of the land \"east\" of the Genesee River, as well as a tract \"west\" of the Genesee, the Mill Yard Tract, surveyed all of it, laid out townships, and sold large parts to speculators and settlers. Nathaniel Gorham Jr. (died October 22, 1836, Canandaigua, New York) was a pioneer settler of this tract, having been placed in charge of his father's interests there.\n\nIn 1790, after Gorham and Phelps defaulted in payment, they sold nearly all of their unsold lands \"east\" of the Genesee to Robert Morris, who eventually resold those lands to The Pulteney Association. Phelps and Gorham were unable to fulfill their contract in full to Massachusetts, so in 1790, they surrendered back to Massachusetts that portion of the lands which remained under the Indian title, namely, the land \"west\" of the Genesee. It also was eventually acquired by Robert Morris, who resold most of it to The Holland Land Company. Morris did keep of land that became known as The Morris Reserve.\n\nGorham died in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1796. A eulogy was delivered in his memory by Dr. Thomas Welch of Charlestown. He is buried in the Phipps Street Cemetery in Charlestown.\n\nGorham Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor. The Town of Gorham, New York, is also named in his honor.\n\nNathaniel Gorham's descendants number in the thousands today. Some of his notable descendants include:\n\n\n"}

He is known to have been suffect consul in the \"nundinium\" of September-December 91, and was appointed Governor of Britannia by the Emperor Domitian before his death, and held the post until 98.\n\nWhile governor, he may have founded the colonies of \"Colonia Domitiana Lindensium\" (Lincoln) and \"Colonia Nervia Glevensium\" (Gloucester).\n\nFurther details about Nepos are more difficult to be confident about. The inscriptions of the Frater Arvale record a Publius Metilius Sabinus Nepos as one of their brotherhood who attended their meetings in the years 105, 110, and 111, who had died by 26 February 118 when a successor was co-opted in his place. On the other hand, a papyrus from Roman Egypt records the joint consulate of P. Metilius Nepos II and Marcus Annius Libo for 128; apparently Nepos died in late 127, and his term assigned to another person. Some assistance is provided by the presence of a \"Metilius\" -- who could be Publius Metilius Nepos or Publius Metilius Sabinus Nepos -- as suffect consul in 103. It is likely we have two consular senators with similar names: one died before February 118, the other in late 127.\n\nPliny the Younger addressed several letters to a Nepos, and at least one more to a Sabinus. It is not yet possible to determine which Nepos Pliny was writing to, nor even assure he was writing to either of these Metilii Nepotes.\n\nThe question of children and descendants is an open one. On one hand there is a Publius Metilius P.f. Secundus, suffect consul in 123, who could be the son of either Metilii Nepotes; on the other, Anthony Birley notes there are two polyonymous senators of the next generation whose names are part of their nomenclature: Marcus Sedatus Severianus consul in 153, and Marcus Metilius Aquillius Regulus consul in 157. The solution awaits further information.\n"}
{"id": "47842317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47842317", "title": "Refugee crisis", "text": "Refugee crisis\n\nRefugee crisis can refer to movements of large groups of displaced people, who could be either internally displaced persons, forced displaced people, refugees or other migrants. It can also refer to incidents in the country of origin or departure, to large problems whilst on the move or even after arrival in a safe country that involve large groups of displaced persons, asylum seekers or refugees. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in 2017, 65.6 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide because of persecution, conflict, violence, or human rights violations alone.\n\nRefugee crisis can refer to large groups of displaced people, who could be either internally displaced persons, refugees or other migrants, the incidents in their country of origin, or to problems while on the move, or it can refer to problems in the hosting countries after arrival involving large groups of displaced persons, asylum seekers or refugees.\n\nCauses for refugee crises can include war and civil war,\nhuman rights violations,\nenvironment and climate.\nIn June 2015 the UN refugee agency reported that wars and persecutions are the main reasons behind the refugee crises all over the world. A decade earlier, six people were forced to leave their homes every 60 seconds, but this average has increased four times because of the wars that drive 24 people from their homes each minute in 2015.\n\nIn countries ravaged by massive corruption and greed by those in political positions, many people have been forced to leave their homes in search of survival in foreign lands. The corruption and greed by those in power in such countries includes their amassal of too much wealth at the expense of many, and they end up grabbing property such as land from the marginalized and murdering the innocent, situations where even when one has the necessary qualifications, he or she cannot find work, all work positions are occupied by relatives who sometimes may not even be qualified for them, all the countries' resources are in the hands of the lucky few in political positions coupled by their misuse of surplus when many are suffering with nothing and remain in tears as is the case in many African nations for example Uganda, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Eritrea and many others being on top of the most corrupt countries in the whole world when their citizens are suffering. This situation of marginalization Discrimination and inequality leads to many to get tired and risk their lives in boat voyages to anywhere they can expect some changes in their lives for example Europe, Canada or North America and Australia among other Countries as its shown in\n\nAlthough they do not fit the definition of refugees set out in the UN Convention, people displaced by the effects of climate change have often been termed \"climate refugees\" or \"climate change refugees\". The term 'environmental refugee' is also commonly used and an estimated 25 million people can currently be classified as such. The alarming predictions by the UN, charities and some environmentalists, that between 200 million and 1 billion people could flood across international borders to escape the impacts of climate change in the next 40 years are realistic. Case studies from Bolivia, Senegal and Tanzania, three countries that are said to be prone to suffering the effects of climate change, show that people affected by environmental degradation rarely move across borders. Instead, they adapt to new circumstances by moving short distances for short periods, often to cities. Millions of people live in places that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. They face extreme weather conditions such as droughts or floods. Their lives and livelihoods might be threatened in new ways and create new vulnerabilities.\n\nFollowing the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the term \"refugee\" was sometimes used to describe people displaced by the storm and the aftereffects. There was an outcry that the term should not be used to describe Americans displaced within their own county, and the term \"evacuee\" was substituted in its place. The UNHCR similarly opposes the use of the term 'refugee' in reference to environmental migrants, as this term has a strict legal definition.\n\nA forcibly displaced person is distinguished from an economic migrant. In 2008, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs suggested a better term for migrants who fled for the purpose of their and their dependents' basic survival was \"forced humanitarian migrants\". These economic migrants fall outside the mandates of the support structures offered by governments and non-governmental organisations for refugees.\n\nEven economic migration requires a certain level of 'wealth' as migration is always a selective process - and the poorest and most vulnerable people are often excluded as they will find it almost impossible to move due to a lack of necessary funds or social support.\n\nAn example is the 2008-2009 mass movement of Zimbabweans to neighboring countries. Most migrants did not fit in either category and had more general needs that fell outside the specific mandate of the UNHCR.\n\nTo emphasize the importance of a common humanitarian position on the outflow of Zimbabweans into the region the Regional Office for Southern Africa of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs coined the term \"migrants of humanitarian concern\" in 2008. Most of those crossing the border did not apply for refugee status, but they could also hardly be considered as \"voluntary\" economic migrants. Many of them were not legally protected, nor do they receive humanitarian support. In Botswana, Zambia and Malawi, asylum is available to Zimbabweans; in Mozambique, the few applicants for asylum had been rejected due to the state's decision to consider Zimbabweans as 'economic' and not as forced humanitarian migrants.\nExcept for South Africa, protection and access to services in most countries in the region is contingent on receiving the refugee status, and require asylum seekers to stay in isolated camps, unable to work or travel, and thus send money to relatives that stayed behind in Zimbabwe. South Africa was considering the introduction of a special permit for Zimbabweans, but the policy was still under review.\n\nSince the establishment of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, instances of population displacement have been identified by registered non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in countries where local governments fail to provide or protect the economic means and social rights of their citizens. In 1963, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, then Deputy High Commissioner, stated - after visiting Africa - that some refugees are \"a by product\" and will probably \"not have much of a chance to return to their country\".\n\nThe Aga Khan Development Network, led by the current Ismaili imam, the Aga Khan IV, is engaged in \"enhanced cooperation\" with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to \"help broaden the way the international community responds to crises today\".\n\nThe term boat people came into common use in the 1970s with the mass exodus of Vietnamese refugees following the Vietnam War. It is a widely used form of migration for people migrating from Cuba, Haiti, Morocco, Vietnam or Albania. They often risk their lives on dangerously crude and overcrowded boats to escape oppression or poverty in their home nations. Events resulting from the Vietnam War led many people in Cambodia, Laos, and especially Vietnam to become refugees in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 2001, 353 asylum seekers sailing from Indonesia to Australia drowned when their vessel sank.\n\nThe main danger to a boat person is that the boat he or she is sailing in may actually be anything that floats and is large enough for passengers. Although such makeshift craft can result in tragedy, in 2003 a small group of 5 Cuban refugees attempted (unsuccessfully, but un-harmed) to reach Florida in a 1950s pickup truck made buoyant by oil barrels strapped to its sides.\n\nBoat people are frequently a source of controversy in the nation they seek to immigrate to, such as the United States, New Zealand, Germany, France, Russia, Canada, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Australia. Boat people are often forcibly prevented from landing at their destination, such as under Australia's Pacific Solution (which operated from 2001 until 2008), or they are subjected to mandatory detention after their arrival.\n\nThere are three Mediterranean refugee routes: Eastern, Central and Western route. Since 2015 more than 700.000 refugees and other migrants used these routes (i.e. the Eastern Balkan route and the Western Balkan route) from Greece through the Balkan to enter central European countries. Since March 2016 the Eastern route is almost closed, but the Western route is still busy.\n\n, 65.6 million individuals have been forcibly displaced worldwide because of persecution, conflict, violence, or human rights violations, per the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Of these, 5.4 million were Palestinian refugees, which are not under UNHCR but under UNRWA’s mandate.\n\nSince 2007, the refugee estimates include not only refugees per the narrow 1951 UN definition, but also people in refugee-like situations, so figures prior to 2007 are not fully comparable. The figure also includes internally displaced persons (IDP) within their country and people in IDP-like situations, which is descriptive and includes groups of persons who are inside their country of nationality or habitual residence and who face protection risks similar to those of IDPs but who, for practical or other reasons, could not be reported as such and stateless persons.\n\nSince the 1950s, many nations in Africa have suffered civil wars and ethnic strife, thus generating a massive number of refugees of many different nationalities and ethnic groups. The number of refugees in Africa increased from 860,000 in 1968 to 6,775,000 by 1992. By the end of 2004, that number had dropped to 2,748,400 refugees, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. (That figure does not include internally displaced persons, who do not cross international borders and so do not fit the official definition of refugee.)\n\nMany refugees in Africa cross into neighboring countries to find haven; often, African countries are simultaneously countries of origin for refugees and countries of asylum for other refugees. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance, was the country of origin for 462,203 refugees at the end of 2004, but a country of asylum for 199,323 other refugees. The largest number of refugees in 2004 are from Sudan and have fled either the longstanding and recently concluded Sudanese Civil War or the War in Darfur and are located mainly in Chad, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration has stated that refugee migration into Algeria has markedly increased since 2014, with most refugees arriving from Niger. According to the Associated Press over 14,000 refugees were expelled from Algeria between August 2017 and June 2018, with refugees forced to walk on foot through the Sahara to small towns in Niger. The AP reported that as many as 30,000 refugees had died in the desert in Algeria, Niger and nearby countries since 2014.\n\nDecolonisation during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass exodus of European-descended settlers out of Africa – especially from North Africa (1.6 million European \"pieds noirs\"), Congo, Mozambique and Angola. By the mid-1970s, the Portugal's African territories were lost, and nearly one million Portuguese or persons of Portuguese descent left those territories (mostly Portuguese Angola and Mozambique) as destitute refugees – the \"retornados\".\n\nThe Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), one of the largest and deadliest Cold War conflicts, erupted shortly after and spread out across the newly independent country. At least one million people were killed, four million were displaced internally and another half million fled as refugees.\n\nIn the 1970s Uganda and other East African nations implemented racist policies that targeted the Asian population of the region. Uganda under Idi Amin's leadership was particularly most virulent in its anti-Asian policies, eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Asian minority. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly Indians born in the country. India had refused to accept them. Most of the expelled Indians eventually settled in the United Kingdom, Canada and in the United States.\n\nThe Lord's Resistance Army insurgency forced many civilians to live in internally displaced person camps.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, over two million people fled into neighboring countries, in particular Zaire. The refugee camps were soon controlled by the former government and Hutu militants who used the camps as bases to launch attacks against the new government in Rwanda. Little action was taken to resolve the situation and the crisis did not end until Rwanda-supported rebels forced the refugees back across the border at the beginning of the First Congo War.\n\nAn estimated 2.5 million people, roughly one-third the population of the Darfur area, have been forced to flee their homes after attacks by Janjaweed Arab militia backed by Sudanese troops during the ongoing war in Darfur in western Sudan since roughly 2003.\n\nFollowing Boko Haram's violence thousands of Nigerians fled to Niger and Cameroon.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees in Egypt, most of them seeking refuge from ongoing military conflicts in their home country of Sudan. Their official status as refugees is highly disputed, and they have been subject to racial discrimination and police violence. They live among a much larger population of Sudanese migrants in Egypt, more than two million people of Sudanese nationality (by most estimates; a full range is 750,000 to 4 million (FMRS 2006:5) who live in Egypt. The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants believes many more of these migrants are in fact refugees, but see little benefit in seeking recognition.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of civil war in Somalia, many of the country's residents left in search of asylum. According to the UNHCR, there were around 976,500 registered refugees from the nation in adjacent states as of 2016. The majority of these individuals were registered in Kenya (413,170: 326,611 in Dadaab, 54,550 in Kakuma, 32,009 in Nairobi), Yemen (253,876 in UNHCR centers and urban areas), and Ethiopia (213,775 in five camps in Dollo Ado). Additionally, 1.1 million people were internally displaced persons (IDPs). Most of the IDPs were Bantus and other ethnic minorities originating from the southern regions, including those displaced in the north. An estimated 60% of the IDPs were children. Causes of the displacement included armed violence, diverted aid flows and natural disasters, which hindered the IDPs' access to safe shelter and resources. IDP settlements were concentrated in south-central Somalia (893,000), followed by the northern Puntland (129,000) and Somaliland (84,000) regions. Additionally, there were around 9,356 registered refugees and 11,157 registered asylum seekers in Somalia. Most of these foreign nationals emigrated from Yemen to northern Somalia after the Houthi insurgency in 2015.\n\nIt is estimated that between 165,000 – 200,000 Sahrawis – people from the disputed territory of Western Sahara – have lived in five large refugee camps near Tindouf in the Algerian part of the Sahara Desert since 1975. The UNHCR and WFP are presently engaged in supporting what they describe as the \"90,000 most vulnerable\" refugees, giving no estimate for total refugee numbers.\n\nRefugees of the 2011 Libyan civil war are the people, predominantly of Libyan nationality, who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 2011 Libyan civil war, from within the borders of Libya to the neighbouring states of Tunisia, Egypt and Chad, as well as to European countries, across the Mediterranean, as Boat people. The majority of Libyan refugees are Arabs and Berbers, though many of other ethnicities, temporarily living in Libya, originated from sub-Saharan Africa, were also among the first refugee waves to exit the country. The total Libyan refugee numbers are estimated at near one million as of June 2011. About half of them had returned to Libyan territory during summer 2011, though large refugee camps on Tunisian and Chad border kept being overpopulated.\n\nMore than one million Salvadorans were displaced during the Salvadoran Civil War from 1975 to 1982. About half went to the United States, most settling in the Los Angeles area.\n\nThere was also a large exodus of Guatemalans during the 1980s, trying to escape from the civil war there as well. These people went to Southern Mexico and the U.S.\n\nFrom 1991 through 1994, following the military coup d'état against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, thousands of Haitians fled violence and repression by boat. Although most were repatriated to Haiti by the U.S. government, others entered the United States as refugees. Haitians were primarily regarded as economic migrants from the grinding poverty of Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe victory of the forces led by Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution led to a large exodus of Cubans between 1959 and 1980. Thousands of Cubans yearly continue to risk the waters of the Straits of Florida seeking better economic and political conditions in the U.S. In 1999 the highly publicized case of six-year-old Elián González brought the covert migration to international attention. Measures by both governments have attempted to address the issue. The U.S. government instituted a wet feet, dry feet policy allowing refuge to those travelers who manage to complete their journey, and the Cuban government has periodically allowed for mass migration by organizing leaving posts. The most famous of these agreed migrations was the Mariel boatlift of 1980.\n\nColombia has one of the world's largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs), with estimates ranging from 2.6 to 4.3 million people, due to the ongoing Colombian armed conflict. The larger figure is cumulative since 1985. It is now estimated by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants that there are about 150,000 Colombians in \"refugee-like situations\" in the United States, not recognized as refugees or subject to any formal protection.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, many U.S. citizens who were conscientious objectors and wished to avoid the draft sought political asylum in Canada. President Jimmy Carter issued an amnesty. Since 1975, the U.S. has resettled approximately 2.6 million refugees, with nearly 77% being either Indochinese or citizens of the former Soviet Union. Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, annual admissions figures have ranged from a high of 207,116 in 1980 to a low of 27,100 in 2002.\n\nCurrently, nine national voluntary agencies resettle refugees nationwide on behalf of the U.S. government: Church World Service, Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, International Rescue Committee, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and World Relief.\n\nJesuit Refugee Service/USA (JRS/USA) has worked to help resettle Bhutanese refugees in the United States. The mission of JRS/USA is to accompany, serve and defend the rights of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons. JRS/USA is one of 10 geographic regions of Jesuit Refugee Service, an international Catholic organization sponsored by the Society of Jesus. In coordination with JRS's International Office in Rome, JRS/USA provides advocacy, financial and human resources for JRS regions throughout the world.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) funds a number of organizations that provide technical assistance to voluntary agencies and local refugee resettlement organizations. RefugeeWorks, headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, is ORR's training and technical assistance arm for employment and self-sufficiency activities, for example. This nonprofit organization assists refugee service providers in their efforts to help refugees achieve self-sufficiency. RefugeeWorks publishes white papers, newsletters and reports on refugee employment topics.\n\nThe US government position on refugees states that there is repression of religious minorities in the Middle East and in Pakistan such as Christians, Hindus, as well as Ahmadi, and Zikri denominations of Islam. In Sudan, where Islam is the state religion, Muslims dominate the government and restrict activities of Christians, practitioners of traditional African indigenous religions and other non-Muslims. The question of Jewish, Christian and other refugees from Arab and Muslim countries was introduced in March 2007 in the US Congress.\n\nIn 2016, the Obama administration announced a commitment to increase the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. to 110,000 in 2017, from the rate of 85,000 in the 2016 fiscal year, in addition to a private sector call to action in the Partnership for Refugees.\n\nThe Bolivarian diaspora is the large-scale emigration of millions of Venezuelans following the establishment of Hugo Chávez's Bolivarian Revolution and its continuation through Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro. The Bolivarian government's policies resulted in increased crime, poverty, food shortages, and widespread corruption, all of which culminated into the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela. The Bolivarian diaspora resulted in the largest recorded refugee crisis in the Americas. Between 1998 and 2018, about 4 million Venezuelans —over 10% of Venezuela's entire population— had emigrated from the Latin American country due to the crisis.\n\nFrom the Soviet invasion in 1979 until the late 2001 U.S.-led invasion, a total of six million citizens of Afghanistan have migrated to neighboring parts of Pakistan and Iran. Since early 2002, however, more than 4 million of these Afghan refugees have voluntarily repatriated through the UNHCR from Pakistan to Afghanistan.\n\nAs of late 2016, some 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees still remain in Pakistan. Most of these were born and raised in Pakistan during the last 35 years but are still counted as citizens of Afghanistan. They are allowed to reside and work in Pakistan until the end of 2018.\n\nIn the meantime, about a million Afghans refugees remain in Iran, which include the many who were born inside Iran during the last 35 years. The number of Afghan refugees is decreasing significantly every year due to voluntary repatriation. For instance, in 2017 alone, over half a million of them returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran.\n\nThe 2011 industrialized country asylum data notes a 30% increase in applications from Afghans from 2010 to 2011, primarily towards Germany and Turkey.\n\nSince the beginning US military intervention against the Taliban in Pakistan over 1.2 million people have been displaced in across the country, joined by a further 555,000 Pakistanis uprooted by fighting since August 2008.\n\nThe partition of the British Raj provinces of Panjab and Bengal and the subsequent independence of Pakistan and one day later of India in 1947 resulted in the largest human movement in history. In this population exchange, approximately 7 million Hindus and Sikhs from Bangladesh and Pakistan moved to India while approximately 7 million Muslims from India moved to Pakistan. Approximately one million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs died during this event.\n\nAs a result of the Bangladesh Liberation War, on 27 March 1971, Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, expressed full support of her Government to the Bangladeshi struggle for freedom. The Bangladesh-India border was opened to allow panic-stricken Bangladeshis' safe shelter in India. The governments of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura established refugee camps along the border. Exiled Bangladeshi army officers and the Indian military immediately started using these camps for recruitment and training members of Mukti Bahini. During the Bangladesh War of Independence around 10 million Bangladeshis fled the country to escape the killings and atrocities committed by the Pakistan Army.\nBangladeshi refugees are known as '\"Chakmas\"' in India. Other than chakmas there are Bengali Hindu refugee are also there who remain in India after war.\n\nThe civil war in Sri Lanka, from 1983 to 2009 had generated thousands of internally displaced people as well as refugees most of them being the Tamils. Many Sri Lankans have fled to neighbourly India and western countries such as Canada, France, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\nWhile successive policies of discrimination and intimidation of the Tamils drove thousands to flee seeking asylum, the brutal end to the Civil War and the ongoing repression have forced a wave of thousands of refugees migrate, to countries like Canada, the UK and especially Australia. Australia in particular, receives hundreds of refugees every month.\n\nAbout 69,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees live in 112 camps in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nAccording to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), about 300,000 Hindu Kashmiri Pandits have been forced to leave the state of Jammu and Kashmir due to Islamic militancy and religious discrimination from the Muslim majority, making them refugees in their own country. Some have found refuge in Jammu and its adjoining areas, while others in camps in Delhi and others in other states of India and other countries too. Kashmiri groups peg the number of migrants closer to 500,000.\n\nDuring the period of united Pakistan (1947–1971), the Urdu-speaking Biharis did not assimilate into the society of Bangladesh and have remained a distinct cultural-linguistic group ever since. after the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 the different linguistic group was assaulted by Bengalis because of their active participation with the Pakistani armed forces in committing genocide over the local populace. Some atrocities took place against Biharis. At the end of the war many Biharis took shelter in refugee camps in different cities, the biggest being the Geneva Camp in Dhaka. It is estimated that about 250,000 Biharis are living in those camps and in Rangpur and Dinajpur districts today. after 1971 many have still been living in Bangladesh while opting to be a repatriated to Pakistan.\n\nBangladesh hosts more than 250,000 Muslim Rohingya refugees who were forced out of their homes in western Burma (Myanmar) and fled in 1991-92 in order to escape persecution by the Burmese military junta. Many have lived there for close to twenty years. The Bangladeshi government divides the Rohingya into two categories – recognized refugees living in official camps and unrecognized refugees living in unofficial sites or among Bangladeshi communities. Around 30,000 Rohingyas are residing in two camps in the Nayapara and Kutupalong areas of the Cox's Bazar district in Bangladesh. These camp residents have access to basic services, those outside do not. With no changes inside Burma in sight, Bangladesh must come to terms with the long-term needs of all the Rohingya refugees in the country, and allow international organizations to expand services that benefit the Rohingya as well as local communities.\n\nThe agency has been supporting Rohingya refugees staying in the camps. On the other hand, it is not receiving applications for refugee status from the newly arrived Rohingyas. This amounts to a compromise of its mandate.\nThe brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against Muslims in Arakan State by the Burmese military in 1991-92 caused a refugee crisis in which thousands of people have been detained in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh and tens of thousands of others have been repatriated to Burma where they face further repression. There are widespread allegations of religious persecution, use of forced labor and denial of citizenship to many Rohingya who were forced to return to Burma since 1996.\nMany have again fled to Bangladesh in order to seek work or shelter, or to flee from Burmese military oppression, and some are forced across the border by Burmese security forces. In the past few months, abuses against Rohingya in Arakan State have continued, including strict registration laws that continue to deny Rohingya citizenship, restrictions on their movement, land confiscation and forced evictions to make way for Buddhist Burmese settlements, widespread forced labor in infrastructure projects and the closure of some mosques, including nine in the North Buthidaung Township of Western Arakan State in the last half of 2006.\n\nAn estimated 90,000 people were displaced in the 2012 sectarian violence between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in Burma's western Rakhine State.\n\nThere are also large numbers of Muslim Rohingya refugees in Pakistan. Most of them have made perilous journeys across Bangladesh and India and settled in Karachi.\n\nAfter the 1959 Tibetan exodus, there are more than 150,000 Tibetans who live in Nepal. These include people who have escaped over the Himalayas from Tibet, as well as their children and grandchildren. In Nepal the overwhelming majority of Tibetans born in Nepal are still stateless and carry a document called an Identity Card issued by the Nepalese government in lieu of a passport. This document states the nationality of the holder as Tibetan. It is a document that is frequently rejected as a valid travel document by many customs and immigrations departments. The Tibetan refugees also own a Green Book issued by the Tibetan Government in Exile for rights and duties towards this administration.\n\nIn 1991–92, Bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 ethnic Nepalis known as Lhotshampas from the southern part of the country. Most of them have been living in seven refugee camps run by UNHCR in eastern Nepal ever since. In March 2008, this population began a multiyear resettlement to other countries including the United States, New Zealand, Denmark, Canada, Norway and Australia. At present, the United States is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these refugees in the US as a third country settlement programme.\n\nMeanwhile, as many as 200,000 Nepalese were displaced during the Maoist insurgency and Nepalese Civil War which ended in 2006.\n\nBy 2009, more than 3 million civilians had been displaced by the War in North-West Pakistan (2004–present).\n\nSince 1991, much of the country's non-Muslim population, including non-ethnic Tajikistan's Russians and Bukharian Jews, have fled Tajikistan due to severe poverty, instability and Tajikistan Civil War (1992–1997). In 1992, most of the country's Jewish population was evacuated to Israel. Most of the ethnic Russian population fled to Russia. By the end of the civil war Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. Due to severe poverty a lot of Tajiks had to migrate to Russia.47% of Tajikistan's GDP comes from immigrant remittances (from Tajiks working in Russia).\n\nIn 1989, after bloody pogroms against the Meskhetian Turks in Central Asia's Ferghana Valley, nearly 90,000 Meskhetian Turks left Uzbekistan.\n\nThe 2010 ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan left some 300,000 people internally displaced, and around 100,000 sought refuge in Uzbekistan.\n\nFollowing the communist takeovers in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in 1975, about three million people attempted to escape in the subsequent decades. With massive influx of refugees daily, the resources of the receiving countries were severely strained. The plight of the boat people became an international humanitarian crisis. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) set up refugee camps in neighboring countries to process the boat people. The budget of the UNHCR increased from $80 million in 1975 to $500 million in 1980. Partly for its work in Indochina, the UNHCR was awarded the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nBetween the first and second world wars, hundreds of thousands of European Jews, mainly from Germany and Austria attempted to flee\nthe German government's anti-semitic policies which culminated in the Holocaust and the mass murder of millions of European Jews. These Jews were often found it difficult or impossible to immigrate to other European countries. The 1938 Evian Conference, the 1943 Bermuda Conference and other attempts failed to resolve the problem of Jewish refugees, a fact widely used in Nazi propaganda (see also MS \"St. Louis\").\n\nSince its founding at the beginning of the 1900s Jewish immigration to the British Mandate for Palestine was encouraged by the nascent Zionist movement, but immigration was restricted by the British government, under the pressure from Palestinian Arabs. Following its formation in 1948, according to 1947 UN Partition Plan, Israel adopted the Law of Return, granting Israeli citizenship to any Jewish immigrant. Mass rioting and attacks on Jews throughout the Muslim World following the creation of the state of Israel led to the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, in which 850,000 Jews fled to Israel between 1948 and the early 1970s.\n\nAccording to the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, a network of European refugee-assisting non-governmental organizations (NGOs), huge differences exist between national asylum systems in Europe, making the asylum system a 'lottery' for refugees. For example, Iraqis who flee their home country and end up in Germany have an 85% chance of being recognised as a refugee and those who apply for asylum in Slovenia do not get a protection status at all.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the Asylum Support Partnership was created to enable all the agencies working to support and assist asylum seekers in making asylum claims was established in 2012 and is part funded by the home office.\n\nIn 2010, President Nicolas Sarkozy began the systematic dismantling of illegal Romani camps and squats in France, deporting thousands of Roma residing in France illegally to Romania, Bulgaria or elsewhere.\n\nSince the 1980s Spain has transitioned from a country whose people emigrated to other countries to one of immigration. Immigrants coming into Spain are categorized and ranked by their country of origin according to Spanish immigration law. Depending on the individual's origin country they can receive “preferred” status over other immigrants who are given “outsider” status due to their country of origin, such as Third World countries. Spain has also added more steps to their asylum procedures, which some critics feel makes it too difficult for refugee and asylum seekers to enter and as such serves as a deterrence tool that violates Spain's international obligation to protect this group of people.\n\nSince 2014 the number of refugees seeking asylum in Spain has increased greatly and Spain has received criticism for what has been perceived as a failure to keep up with these numbers. Spain has offered to provide asylum to 17,337 refugees by September 2017, however, only 744 of which were extended asylum status in the country by July 2017. In 2016 the Pew Research Center found that from July 2015 to May 2016 there was an increase in percentage point of the refugee population in many European countries, however Spain was one of the few that experienced a decrease. The difficulty with refugees successfully immigrating to Spain has led to some researchers such as Kitty Calavita to suggest that the country's marginalization and social and economic exclusion are primarily produced by law, rather than culture.\n\nIn 1956–57 following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 nearly 200,000 persons, about two percent of the population of Hungary, fled as refugees to Austria and West Germany.\n\nThe Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was followed by a wave of emigration, unseen before. It stopped shortly after (estimate: 70,000 immediately, 300,000 in total).\n\nFollowing the Greek Civil War (1946–1949) hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Ethnic Macedonians were expelled or fled the country. The number of refugees ranged from 35,000 to over 213,000. Over 28,000 children were evacuated by the Partisans to the Eastern Bloc and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. This left thousands of Greeks and Aegean Macedonians spread across the world.\n\nThe forced assimilation campaign of the late 1980s directed against ethnic Turks resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 Bulgarian Turks to Turkey.\n\nBeginning in 1991, political upheavals in Southeastern Europe such as the breakup of Yugoslavia, displaced about 2,700,000 people by mid-1992, of which over 700,000 of them sought asylum in European Union member states. In 1999, about one million Albanians escaped from Serbian persecution.\n\nToday there are still thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons in Southeastern Europe who cannot return to their homes. Most of them are Serbs who cannot return to Kosovo, and who still live in refugee camps in Serbia today. Over 200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanian minorities fled or were expelled from Kosovo after the Kosovo War in 1999.\n\nIn 2009, between 7% and 7.5% of Serbia's population were refugees and IDPs. Around 500,000 refugees, mainly from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, arrived following the Yugoslav wars. The IDPs were primarily from Kosovo. , Serbia had the largest refugee population in Europe.\n\nSince 1992, ongoing conflict has taken place in the North Caucasus region of Russia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chechnya broke away and became a \"de facto\" independent state. This move was not recognized by the Russian Federation, which invaded, leading to the first Chechen war. As a consequence, about 2 million people have been displaced and still cannot return to their homes. Due to widespread lawlessness and ethnic cleansing under the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev most non-Chechens (and many Chechens as well) fled the country during the 1990s or were killed.\n\nThe Nagorno Karabakh conflict has resulted in the displacement of 528,000 Azerbaijanis (this figure does not include new born children of these IDPs) from Armenian occupied territories including Nagorno Karabakh, and 220,000 Azeris and 18,000 Kurds fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan from 1988 to 1989. 280,000 persons—virtually all ethnic Armenians—fled Azerbaijan during the 1988–1993 war over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994, an estimated 17,000 people had been killed, 50,000 had been injured, and over a million had been displaced.\n\nMore than 250,000 people, mostly Georgians but some others too, were the victims of forcible displacement and ethnic-cleansing from Abkhazia during the War in Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, and afterwards in 1993 and 1998.\n\nAs a result of 1991–1992 South Ossetia War, about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled South Ossetia and Georgia proper, most across the border into Russian North Ossetia. A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia and settled in other parts of Georgia.\n\nThe United Nations estimated 100,000 Georgians have been uprooted as a result of the 2008 South Ossetia war; some 30,000 residents of South Ossetia fled into the neighboring Russian province of North Ossetia.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UNHCR's European director Vincent Cochetel), 814,000 Ukrainians have fled to Russia since the beginning of 2014, including those who did not register as asylum seekers, and 260,000 left to other parts of Ukraine.\nHowever, also quoting UNHCR, Deutsche Welle says 197,000 Ukrainians fled to Russia by 20 August 2014 and not less than 190,000 have fled to other parts of Ukraine, 14,000 to Belarus and 14,000 to Poland. In Russia many were resettled in specially built refugee villages in Siberia. Russia also registered 2 million new citizens of Ukraine in October 2015, who had arrived since 1 January 2014.\n\nAccording to a United Nations early March 2016 report 1.6 million people were registered internally displaced by the Ukrainian government. 800,000 to 1 million of them lived within Ukrainian government controlled Ukraine.\n\nThe 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey was stemmed from the \"Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations\" signed at Lausanne, Switzerland, on 30 January 1923, by the governments of Greece and the Republic of Turkey. It involved approximately 2 million people (around 1.5 million Anatolian Greeks and 500,000 Muslims in Greece), most of whom were forcibly made refugees and \"de jure\" denaturalized from their homelands.\n\nBy the end of 1922, the vast majority of native Asia Minor Greeks had already fled the Greek genocide (1914–1922) and Greece's later defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). According to some calculations, during the autumn of 1922, around 900,000 Greeks arrived in Greece. The population exchange was envisioned by Turkey as a way to formalize, and make permanent, the exodus of Greeks from Turkey, while initiating a new exodus of a smaller number of Muslims from Greece to supply settlers for occupying the newly depopulated regions of Turkey, while Greece saw it as a way to supply its masses of new propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey with lands to settle from the exchanged Muslims of Greece.\n\nThis major compulsory population exchange, or agreed mutual expulsion, was based not on language or ethnicity, but upon religious identity, and involved nearly all the Orthodox Christian citizens of Turkey, including its native Turkish-speaking Orthodox citizens, and most of the Muslim citizens of Greece, including its native Greek-speaking Muslim citizens.\n\nA heavy exodus of the non-Jewish population of Palestine took place in 1948. Though usually described as byproduct of the 1948 Palestine war, the first and largest wave of Palestinian refugees took place in early 1948, shortly after the Deir Yassin massacre—preceding, therefore, said war, with expulsions of Palestinians continuing to happen for some years thereafter. According to files belonging to the Israeli army that came under the attention of Israeli historians such as Benny Morris, the overwhelming majority (about 73%) of Palestinian refugees left as a result of actions undertaken by Zionist militias and Jewish authorities, with a smaller percentage, about 5%, leaving voluntarily. By the end of 1948, there were about 700,000 Palestinian refugees.\n\nFollowing the departure of refugees, properties, lands, money, and bank accounts belonging to Palestinians were frozen and confiscated. Jewish ownership of the land, which by late 1947 accounted for less than 6% of historic Palestine and less than 10% of the territory the UN allotted to the Jewish state, swelled.\n\nDispossession and displacement of Palestinians continued in the decades after Israel's independence, and renewal of conflicts between Israel and its neighbors. During the 1967 war, about 400,000 Palestinians, half of whom were 1948 refugees, fled their lands in the West Bank following advances by the Israeli army and settled in Jordan. In the 2000s, Israel blacklisted the refugees from that war to impede them from returning and reclaiming their properties and lands, which have been allocated to Jewish settlements and Israeli military bases. Israel has also admitted to revoking the residency rights of 250,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories in the period between 1967 and 1994, the year of the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, after they left temporarily to study and work abroad.\n\nPalestinian refugees and their descendents spread throughout the Arab world; the largest populations are found in neighboring Levantine countries—Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. The populations of the West Bank and Gaza are also composed to a large extent of refugees and their descendents. Until 1967, the West Bank and Gaza were officially ruled, respectively, by Jordan and Egypt. Jordan's Hashemite Kingdom was the only Arab government to have granted citizenship to Palestinian refugees.\n\nPalestinian refugees from 1948 and their descendants do not come under the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, but under the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which created its own criteria for refugee classification. The great majority of Palestinian refugees have kept the refugee status for generations, under a special decree of the UN, and legally defined to include descendants of refugees, as well as others who might otherwise be considered internally displaced persons.\n\nAs of December 2005, the World Refugee Survey of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants estimates the total number of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to be 2,966,100. Palestinian refugees number almost half of Jordan's population, however they have assimilated into Jordanian society, having a full citizenship. In Syria, though not officially becoming citizens, most of the Palestinian refugees were granted resident rights and issued travel documents. Following the Oslo Agreements, attempts were made to integrate the displaced Palestinians and their descendants into the Palestinian community. In addition, Israel granted permissions for family reunions and return of only about 10,000 Fatah members to the West Bank. The refugee situation and the presence of numerous refugee camps continues to be a point of contention in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War. There were 400,000 Palestinians in Kuwait before the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait. After the Gulf War in 1991, Kuwaiti authorities pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries was the departure, flight, expulsion, evacuation and migration, of 850,000 Jews, primarily of Sephardi and Mizrahi background, from Arab and Muslim countries, mainly from 1948 to the early 1970s. They and their descendants make up the majority of Israeli Jews.\n\nA number of small-scale Jewish exoduses began in many Middle Eastern countries early in the 20th century with the only substantial aliyah coming from Yemen and Syria. Prior to the creation of Israel in 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands that now make up the Arab world. Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French and Italian-controlled North Africa, 15–20% in the Kingdom of Iraq, approximately 10% in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7% in the Kingdom of Yemen. A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey.\n\nThe first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily from Iraq, Yemen and Libya. In these cases over 90% of the Jewish population left, despite the necessity of leaving their property behind. Two hundred and sixty thousand Jews from Arab countries immigrated to Israel between 1948 and 1951, accounting for 56% of the total immigration to the newly founded state. Following the establishment of the State of Israel, a plan to accommodate 600,000 immigrants over four years, doubling the existing Jewish population, was submitted by the Israeli government to the Knesset. The plan, however, encountered mixed reactions; there were those within the Jewish Agency and government who opposed promoting a large-scale emigration movement among Jews whose lives were not in danger.\n\nLater waves peaked at different times in different regions over the subsequent decades. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 following the Suez Crisis. The exodus from the other North African Arab countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of Jews from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. Six hundred thousand Jews from Arab and Muslim countries had reached Israel by 1972. In total, of the 900,000 Jews who left Arab and other Muslim countries, 600,000 settled in the new state of Israel, and 300,000 immigrated to France and the United States. The descendants of the Jewish immigrants from the region, known as Mizrahi Jews (\"Eastern Jews\") and Sephardic Jews (\"Spanish Jews\"), currently constitute more than half of the total population of Israel, partially as a result of their higher fertility rate. In 2009, only 26,000 Jews remained in Arab countries and Iran and 26,000 in Turkey.\n\nThe reasons for the exodus included push factors, such as persecution, antisemitism, political instability, poverty and expulsion, together with pull factors, such as the desire to fulfill Zionist yearnings or find a better economic status and a secure home in Europe or the Americas. The history of the exodus has been politicized, given its proposed relevance to the historical narrative of the Arab–Israeli conflict.\n\nAfter the 1967 war, when Israel launched pre-emptive attacks on Egypt and Syrian and annexed the Golan Heights. Israel destroyed 139 Syrian villages in the occupied territory of the Golan Heights and 130,000 of its residents fled or were expelled from their lands, which now serve the purpose of settlements and military bases. About 9,000 Syrians, all of whom of the Druze ethno-religious group, were allowed to remain in their lands.\n\nIt is estimated that 40% of the Greek population of Cyprus, as well as over half of the Turkish Cypriot population, were displaced during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The figures for internally displaced Cypriots varies, the United Peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) estimates 165,000 Greek Cypriots and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots. The UNHCR registers slightly higher figures of 200,000 and 65,000 respectively, being partly based on official Cypriot statistics which register children of displaced families as refugees. The separation of the two communities via the UN patrolled Green Line prohibited the return of all internally displaced people.\n\nIt is estimated that some 900,000 people, representing one-fifth of the pre-war population, were displaced from their homes during the Lebanese Civil War.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1999, the Turkish Armed Forces and various groups claiming to represent the Kurdish people have engaged in open war, and much of the countryside in the southeast was depopulated, with Kurdish civilians moving to local defensible centers such as Diyarbakır, Van, and Şırnak, as well as to the cities of western Turkey and even to western Europe. The causes of the depopulation included Kurdistan Workers' Party atrocities against Kurdish clans they could not control, the poverty of the southeast, and the Turkish state's military operations. Human Rights Watch has documented many instances where the Turkish military forcibly evacuated villages, destroying houses and equipment to prevent the return of the inhabitants. An estimated 3,000 Kurdish villages in Turkey were virtually wiped from the map, representing the displacement of more than 378,000 people.\n\nThe Iran–Iraq War from 1980 to 1988, the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the first Gulf War and subsequent conflicts all generated hundreds of thousands if not millions of refugees. Iran also provided asylum for 1,400,000 Iraqi refugees who had been uprooted as a result of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq (1990–91). At least one million Iraqi Kurds were displaced during the Al-Anfal Campaign (1986–1989).\n\nThe Iraq War has generated millions of refugees and internally displaced persons. As of 2007 more Iraqis have lost their homes and become refugees than the population of any other country. Over 4,700,000 people, more than 16% of the Iraqi population, have become uprooted. Of these, about 2 million have fled Iraq and flooded other countries, and 2.7 million are estimated to be refugees inside Iraq, with nearly 100,000 Iraqis fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month. Only 1% of the total Iraqi displaced population was estimated to be in the Western countries.\n\nRoughly 40% of Iraq's middle class is believed to have fled, the U.N. said. Most are fleeing systematic persecution and have no desire to return. All kinds of people, from university professors to bakers, have been targeted by militias, insurgents and criminals. An estimated 331 school teachers were slain in the first four months of 2006, according to Human Rights Watch, and at least 2,000 Iraqi doctors have been killed and 250 kidnapped since the 2003 U.S. invasion. Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan live in impoverished communities with little international attention to their plight and little legal protection. In Syria alone an estimated 50,000 Iraqi girls and women, many of them widows, are forced into prostitution just to survive.\n\nAccording to Washington-based Refugees International, out of the 4.2 million refugees fewer than 800 have been allowed into the US since the 2003 invasion. Sweden had accepted 18,000 and Australia had resettled almost 6,000. By 2006 Sweden had granted protection to more Iraqis than all the other EU Member States combined. However, and following repeated unanswered calls to its European partners for greater solidarity, July 2007 saw Sweden introduce a more restrictive policy towards Iraqi asylum seekers, which is expected to reduce the recognition rate in 2008.\n\nAs of September 2007 Syria had decided to implement a strict visa regime to limit the number of Iraqis entering the country at up to 5,000 per day, cutting the only accessible escape route for thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war in Iraq. A government decree that took effect on 10 September 2007 bars Iraqi passport holders from entering Syria except for businessmen and academics. Until then, Syria was the only country that had resisted strict entry regulations for Iraqis.\n\nIn June 2014, More than 500,000 people fled Mosul to escape from the advancing Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\nSince 2007, the small Mandaean and Yazidi communities have been at risk of elimination due to ethnic cleansing by Islamic militants. Entire neighborhoods in Baghdad were ethnically cleansed by Shia and Sunni Militias. Satellite shows ethnic cleansing in Iraq was key factor in \"surge\" success.\n\nJordan has one of the world's largest immigrant populations with some sources putting the immigrant percentage to being 60%. Iraqi refugees number between 750,000 and 1 million in Jordan with most living in Amman. Jordan also has Armenian, Chechen, Circassian minorities, and about half of its population is said to be of Palestinian refugees and their descendants.\n\nTo escape the violence, nearly 4,088,078 Syrian refugees have fled the country to neighboring Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq.\n\nSince 2003, an estimated 70,000 immigrants arrived illegally from various African countries into Israel. Some 600 refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan have been granted temporary resident status that is to be renewed every year, although not official refugee status. Another 2,000 refugees from the conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia have been granted temporary resident status on humanitarian grounds. Israel prefers not to recognize them as refugees so as not to offend Eritrea and Ethiopia. The Sudanese, who are from an enemy state, are also not recognized as refugees. In effect, Israeli politicians, including the current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have referred to the refugees as a threat to Israel's \"Jewish character\". African refugees are sometimes subject to racism and racial riots, as well as physical assaults. These assaults have been occurring in Israel, especially in southern Tel Aviv since mid-2012.\n\nOver the past years, conflicts have occurred between Israelis and African immigrants in southern Tel-Aviv, mostly due to poverty issues on both sides. Locals accuse African immigrants of rape, Stealing and assault, making racial issues emerge in the southern part of Tel-Aviv, which became an immigrant-populated area.\n\nIn 2012, Reuters reported that Israel may jail \"illegal immigrants\" for up to three years under a law put into effect to stem the flow of Africans across the desert border with Egypt. Netanyahu said in effect that, \"If we don't stop their entry, the problem that currently stands at 60,000 could grow to 600,000, and that threatens our existence as a uniquely Jewish and democratic state.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1671932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1671932", "title": "Seventy disciples", "text": "Seventy disciples\n\nThe seventy disciples or seventy-two disciples (known in the Eastern Christian traditions as the Seventy[-two] Apostles) were early emissaries of Jesus mentioned in the Gospel of Luke. According to Luke, the only gospel in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.\n\nIn Western Christianity, they are usually referred to as disciples, whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as Apostles. Using the original Greek words, both titles are descriptive, as an \"apostle\" is one sent on a mission (the Greek uses the verb form: \"apesteilen\") whereas a \"disciple\" is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words \"apostle\" and \"disciple\". Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the Latter Day Saint movement is the only current one to use Seventy as a title for a priesthood office.\n\nThe passage from Luke 10 reads (in Young's Literal Translation):\n\nThis is the only mention of the group in the Bible. The number is \"seventy\" in some manuscripts of the Alexandrian (such as Codex Sinaiticus) and Caesarean text traditions but \"seventy-two\" in most other Alexandrian and Western texts. It may derive from the seventy nations of Genesis 10 or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the Septuagint from the Letter of Aristeas. In translating the \"Vulgate\", Jerome selected the reading of seventy-two.\n\nThe \"Gospel of Luke\" is not alone among the synoptic gospels in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion () is closely based on the \"limited commission\" mission in \"Mark\" , which however recounts the sending out of the twelve apostles, rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also Matthew , , ) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized Q document. Luke also mentions the Great Commission to \"all nations\" () but in less detail than Matthew's account and mentions the Dispersion of the Apostles.\n\nWhat has been said to the seventy (two) in is referred in passing to the Twelve in :\n\nThe feast day commemorating the seventy is known as the \"Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles\" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on January 4. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the liturgical year (see Eastern Orthodox Church calendar).\n\nHippolytus of Rome was a disciple of Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, a disciple of Apostle John. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on Mount Athos in 1854. While his major work \"The Refutation of All Heresies\" was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, \"On the Twelve Apostles of Christ\" and \"On the Seventy Apostles of Christ\", are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers. Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's \"On the Seventy Apostles of Christ\":\n\nThese two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.\n\nMany of the names included among the seventy are recognizable for their other achievements. The names included in various lists differ slightly. In the lists, Luke is also one of these seventy himself. The following list gives a widely accepted canon. Their names are listed below:\n\n\nMatthias, who would later replace Judas Iscariot as one of the twelve apostles, is also often numbered among the seventy, since John Mark is typically viewed as Mark the Evangelist.\n\nAlso, some lists name a few different disciples than the ones listed above. Other names commonly included are:\n\nThese are usually included at the expense of the aforementioned Timothy, Titus, Archippus, Crescens, Olympas, Epaphroditus, Quadratus, Aquila, Fortunatus, and/or Achaicus.\n\nBishop Solomon of Basra of the Church of the East in the 13th century offers the following list:\n\n\nA more concise and acknowledged list is below:\n\nAdditional Names:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33015650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33015650", "title": "Susanna Cole", "text": "Susanna Cole\n\nSusanna Cole (née Hutchinson; 1633 – before December 14, 1713) was the lone survivor of an American Indian attack in which many of her siblings were killed, as well as her famed mother Anne Hutchinson. She was taken captive following the attack and held for several years before her release.\n\nSusanna Hutchinson was born in Alford, Lincolnshire, England and was less than a year old when her family sailed from England to New England in 1634. She was less than five when her family settled on Aquidneck Island (later Rhode Island) in the Narragansett Bay following her mother's banishment from Massachusetts during the Antinomian Controversy. Her father died when she was about eight years old, and she, her mother, and six of her siblings left Rhode Island to live in New Netherland. They settled in an area that became the far northeastern section of The Bronx in New York City, near the Westchester County line. The family found themselves caught in the middle of Kieft's War between the local Siwanoy Indians and the colony of New Netherland, and they were all massacred in August 1643, except for Susanna. She was taken captive by the Indians, and was traded back to the English three years later.\n\nWhen Susanna was released from her Indian captivity, she was taken to Boston where her oldest brother and an older sister lived, was re-introduced into English society, and married John Cole at the age of 18, the son of Boston innkeeper Samuel Cole. They lived in Boston for a few years, but moved by 1663 to the Narragansett country of Rhode Island (later North Kingstown) to look after the lands of her oldest brother Edward Hutchinson. Here the couple remained and raised a large family. Susanna Cole was still alive in 1707 when given administration of her husband's estate, but was deceased by December 1713 when her son William took receipts concerning his parents' estate.\n\nSusanna Hutchinson was baptized in Alford, Lincolnshire on 15 November 1633. She was the youngest child of William and Anne Hutchinson to accompany her parents on the voyage from England to New England in 1634. She was the couple's 14th child, of whom 11 survived to make the trip to the New World; a 15th child was born in New England. The family settled in Boston and lived across the street from magistrate John Winthrop, who was a judge during the civil trial in 1637 that led to her mother's banishment from the Massachusetts colony. While Hutchinson was still very young, her mother hosted popular religious discussions at their home. Her mother's religious views were at odds with the orthodoxy of the Puritan ministers; she helped to create a major division in the Boston church and an untenable situation for the colony's leaders. The family was forced to leave Massachusetts; they settled with many of her mother's supporters on Rhode Island in the Narragansett Bay, establishing the settlement of Portsmouth which soon became a part of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Susanna was less than five years old when the family left Boston, and she was about eight when her father died in Portsmouth.\n\nSusanna's widowed mother was frightened at the prospect of Massachusetts gaining influence or control over Rhode Island. Consequently, she moved to the part of New Netherland that later became The Bronx in New York City, along with her six youngest children, an older son, a son-in-law, and some servants. The Dutch were engaged in Kieft's War against the Siwanoy Indians during the family's tenure there. In August 1643, Siwonoy attacked the emigrant household and killed all members of the family, except for nine year-old Susanna. According to one story, Susanna's red hair spared her from the slaughter, while another account claimed that the girl was out picking blueberries some distance from the house and hid in the crevice of Split Rock. In any event, the attackers took her captive and held her for several years.\n\nMassachusetts governor John Winthrop provides an account of Susanna in his journal, under the date of July 1646:\n\nA daughter of Mrs. Hutchinson was carried away by the Indians near the Dutch, when her mother and others were killed by them; and upon the peace concluded between the Dutch and the same Indians, she was returned to the Dutch governor, who restored her to her friends here. She was about eight years old, when she was taken, and continued with them about four years, and she had forgot her own language, and all her friends, and was loath to have come from the Indians.\n\nWinthrop says that Hutchinson was captive for about four years, although his journal makes clear that her captivity lasted less than three years. When she returned to Boston, her living siblings were her oldest brother Edward, brother Samuel, and her two oldest living sisters Faith (the wife of Thomas Savage) and Bridget (the wife of John Sanford). Faith lived in Mount Wollaston, about ten miles south of Boston; Bridget lived in Portsmouth, Rhode Island; and Samuel's residence is unknown. Only her brother Edward is known to have lived in Boston proper, and it is likely that Susanna came to live with him and his family. On 30 December 1651, she married John Cole in Boston, the son of Boston innkeeper Samuel Cole, who had established Boston's first tavern in 1634.\n\nSusanna and John Cole began raising a family in Boston, but they went to look after her brother's land in the Narragansett country by 1663, which was then in disputed territory but later became North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Here the Coles lived for the remainder of their lives, rearing many children. The will of John Cole's father Samuel Cole, dated 21 December 1666, left a property at Bendall's Dock in Boston to Susanna and her children to satisfy an agreement with Susanna's brother Edward Hutchinson and uncle Samuel Hutchinson. This property was leased out in 1676, and sold in 1698 for £160.\n\nIn April 1667, John Cole deeded their house in Boston to Susanna's brother Edward and uncle Samuel, signifying that they intended to remain in Narragansett. They lived in the vicinity of Wickford, an area claimed by both Connecticut and Rhode Island. Many of the Wickford inhabitants preferred to be under the jurisdiction of Connecticut, and John Cole became a magistrate and commissioner for the area in the late 1660s under the auspices of the Connecticut government. Rhode Island was eventually given control over the Narragansett lands following many years of dispute and tension, and John Cole was made a conservator of the peace under the Rhode Island government in 1682. John died by 1707, and Susanna and her son William were given administration of his estate during that year. Susanna died by 14 December 1713, and her son William \"took receipts from heirs for their full proportion of estate of deceased father and mother.\"\n\nSusanna and John Cole had 11 children: Susanna, Samuel, Mary, John, Ann, a second John, Hannah, William, Francis, Elizabeth, and Elisha; at least 9 of them grew to maturity. Their oldest daughter Susanna married Thomas Eldred, but the fate is not known of their oldest son Samuel. Mary lived into her 60s, never marrying, and John Jr. died as a youngster. Ann married Henry Bull, the son of Jireh Bull, and grandson of Rhode Island colonial governor Henry Bull. A second John grew to maturity; Hannah married Thomas Place; and William married Ann Pinder. Francis grew to maturity; Elizabeth (1673-1744) married Robert Potter (1667-1745), grandson of original Rhode Island settler Nathaniel Potter (1616-1644); and Elisha married Elizabeth Dexter and was a Deputy or Assistant in the Rhode Island colony for many years. Among her well-known descendants are two aspirants to the United States Presidency: Stephen Arnold Douglas, who lost to Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 election, and Willard Mitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012. Her grandson John Cole, the son of Elisha Cole, was a chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.\n\nThere have been numerous books and articles written about Susanna Cole's famous mother Anne Hutchinson, most of which mention Susanna. The novel \"Trouble's Daughter\" by Katherine Kirkpatrick presents a fictionalized account about Susanna's life with the Indians who captured her, but it also presents some of the limited historical information that is available about her.\n\nA bronze statue in front of the Massachusetts State House in Boston displays an assumed likeness of Cole as a youngster and her mother Anne Hutchinson; it was dedicated in 1922.\n\nSome of Susanna's ancestry on her father's side was published by John D. Champlin in 1913, and he published much of her ancestry on her mother's side the following year.\n\n\n\n"}

Davis\n\nTerrence Andrew Davis (December 15, 1969 – August 11, 2018) was an American computer programmer known for creating the operating system TempleOS, developing it alone over the course of a decade. In 1996, Davis began experiencing regular manic episodes, leading him to numerous stays at mental hospitals. Initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he was later declared schizophrenic and remained unemployed for the rest of his life.\n\nDavis was born in West Allis, Wisconsin, later moving to Washington, Michigan, California, and Arizona. He was the seventh of eight children, and his father was an industrial engineer. As a child, Davis owned an Apple II and subsequently learned assembly language on a Commodore 64. He earned a masters degree in electric engineering from Arizona State University and worked for several years at TicketMaster as a programmer for VAX machines.\n\nDavis worked on TempleOS for 12 years. Its development began circa 2003, after he suffered from delusions of space aliens and government agents that left him briefly hospitalized for his mental health issues. Davis grew up Catholic and was an atheist before experiencing a self-described \"revelation\". He described the experience as seeming \"a lot like mental illness ... I felt guilty for being such a technology-advocate atheist ... It would sound polite if you said I scared myself thinking about quantum computers.\" Afterward, he proclaimed that he was in direct communication with God, that God told him the operating system he built was for God's third temple, and that TempleOS is of \"divine intellect\" due to the inspired nature of the code. He initially called it the \"J Operating system\" and later renamed it to \"LoseThos\", a reference to a scene from \"Platoon\" (1986). Another name he used was \"SparrowOS\" before settling on \"TempleOS\".\n\nDavis was controversial for his regular use of racist and homophobic slurs, sometimes rebuking his critics as \"niggers\". However, the critical reception to TempleOS was mostly favorable, as tech journalist David Cassel wrote, \"programming websites tried to find the necessary patience and understanding to accommodate Davis\". TechRepublic and OSNews published positive articles on Davis' work, even though Davis was banned from the latter for hostile comments targeting its readers and staff. He frequently communicated in randomly-generated blocks of text and off-topic declarations about God, which led to other bans from Something Awful, Reddit, and Hacker News.\n\nOnce TempleOS was released, most of Davis' time was spent \"coding, web surfing, or using the output from the National Institute of Standards and Technology randomness beacon to talk to God\". He posted hours of video blogs to social media, referring to himself as \"the smartest programmer that's ever lived\", and attracted a small online following. One fan described him as a \"programming legend\", while another, a computer engineer, compared the development of TempleOS to a one-man-built skyscraper. He was \"always lucid\" talking with fans if the subject was about computers. In 2017, the OS was shown as a part of an outsider art exhibition in Bourogne, France.\n\nDuring his final years, Davis struggled with periods of homelessness and brief jailtime. He stopped taking medication because he believed it limited his creativity. Some fans helped him by bringing him supplies, but he refused their housing offers. On the evening of August 11, 2018, while walking alongside railroad tracks in The Dalles, Oregon, he was struck from the back and killed by a Union Pacific train. Investigators could not determine if his death was suicide or accidental. In his final video, recorded and uploaded hours before his death, he explained that he had recently removed most of his videos because he did not wish to \"litter\" the Internet. As reports of his death surfaced online, he was memorialized by fans in a number of tributes posted to social media.\n"}
{"id": "43684936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43684936", "title": "The Amazing Acro-Cats", "text": "The Amazing Acro-Cats\n\nThe Amazing Acro-cats is a circus troupe of domestic cats and a few other small animals, founded by animal trainer Samantha Martin. One of the featured performers is the musical band, the Rock-Cats. The troupe is based in Chicago, and tours the United States for nine months of the year.\n\nFounder Samantha Martin created the show in approximately 2005 as a way \"to keep her show cats mentally sharp in between television, film, and advertising jobs.\" In 2009, the troupe began to tour the U.S. from its base in Chicago. In 2013, the troupe held its first show in Canada, in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nIn 2012, Martin started a Kickstarter fundraiser to replace the aging RV that had been used as the tour bus. A goal of the campaign was to upgrade the facility, providing \"a lush, plush, safe, and stimulating environment for the cats; everything from built-in perches, posts, catwalks, and toys; and even a nursery for our foster kittens.\" Over $30,500 was raised from 567 contributors, which exceeded the campaign goal by over $2,500. A new bus was in place by February 2013.\n\nMartin uses clicker training to teach domestic cats and other animals to perform tricks. A treat is given at the sound of a click at the exact moment the cats are doing a desired behavior. \"It's just more of a fine tuning way of training,\" Martin said. \"It's noise and treats. It triggers something in their brain, and they get it very quickly.\"\n\nMartin uses varieties of tuna and chicken to reward the cats. The results are not as consistent as might be achieved with more compliant animals such as dogs, but the \"long-standing notion that cats are un-trainable is thrown completely out the window.\" During the one-hour show, the cats perform tricks such as \"walking tightropes, pushing carts, skateboarding, jumping through hoops, ringing bells, balancing on balls and turning on lights.\" When the cats don't perform as planned, it adds an element of humour, an important part of the show.\n\nMartin aims to improve the public perception of cats and to promote their welfare during her show. \"We use our show as an entertaining demonstration of what cats are really capable of, as well as the healthy benefits of clicker training.\" Martin demonstrates the clicker training technique in the show, training a kitten or cat to learn some new tricks. She explains that training can build richer relationships between cats and their humans; can be life-saving in emergencies when cats are trained to go to their carrier at the sound of a whistle; and can prevent behavioral problems, while providing physical exercise and mental stimulation. \"'We hope people are inspired to train their own cats,' Martin said. 'They enjoy the training. They want you to work with them.'\" Clicker training kits are made available for purchase at shows and online.\n\nThe cats in the troupe are mainly former orphans, rescues and strays. Since about 2008, Martin has also fostered many homeless cats and kittens. She brings her fosters on tour, training them and featuring them in the show. Over the years, over 140 foster cats or kittens have been adopted to new homes as a result of these efforts. A portion of show proceeds is typically given to cat rescue organizations, and on occasion the show itself is a benefit to promote a rescue organization.\n\nEach show closes with a performance by the Rock-Cats, billed as the \"only cat band in existence\". A review of a Seattle show in 2014 said \"these cats are capable of anarchic musical compositions\" that Martin likens to free jazz; \"an unpredictable assortment of instrument clanging, and rarely does it sound like the cats are playing the same song, let alone an actual, fully realized piece of music.\" Nevertheless, the reviewer found that \"\"white-haired diva\" band leader Tuna \"has the perfect demeanor for a rock star of any species.\"\" Another reviewer of the Seattle show said it was a \"really, really fun way to spend an afternoon\", and listened politely to the band while realizing that Oz was a better guitar player than she was.\n\nA reviewer of a 2013 show in New Orleans was critical of the band's musicality, and complained that the advertised \"seasonal carol selections such as 'A Cat in a Manger' and 'Catnip Roasting on an Open Fire'\" never materialized.\" A review of a Los Angeles show in 2012 stated that although the band was unlikely to win any Grammy Awards anytime soon, \"what they lacked in technical skill, they certainly made up for in rock 'n' roll catitude\". \n\n\n\nThe circus performances involve demonstrations of feline agility. In 2014, Alley, a calico domestic short-haired cat, broke the Guinness World Record for the longest jump by a domestic cat at six feet or 182.88 cm.\n\nMartin maintains her long-standing business Samantha's Amazing Animals, where she showcases cats and other animals for hire in television, film and advertising jobs. Twenty-nine domestic cats and an African serval were listed for hire in 2014, each with their own profile.\n\nTuna starred as a killer cat in the award-winning 2004 short film \"Zeke\". She also starred in a film \"Cat House\" and had a smaller role in the film \"Ophelia\". On television, she competed in the Animal Planet program Pet Star, was featured in the Animal Planet program \"Animal Witness\", has appeared in a Comedy Central pilot television program, and was the main cat in the television program \"Mama Said\". Tuna has also worked in advertising since she was a six-week-old kitten. \n\nBuggles, a female mainly black tabby domestic short-haired cat born in 2007, has appeared in the independent film \"South Dakota\" and an international film, \"God's Smile\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35836497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35836497", "title": "Thomas Jolley", "text": "Thomas Jolley\n\nThomas Glenn Jolley (January 26, 1944 – March 20, 2014) was an anti-Vietnam War protester who renounced his U.S. citizenship in Canada. His move made him one of a small number of former Americans who voluntarily made themselves stateless as a form of political protest. Soon after his renunciation, Jolley crossed back into the U.S. and began working in Florida. A U.S. federal court ruled that he was deportable, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service could not actually deport him to Canada because he had lost his Canadian landed immigrant status. He died in Asheville, North Carolina at the age of 70.\n\nJolley was born in Greensboro, North Carolina. He grew up in Bremen, Georgia, and went on to attend the University of Georgia before transferring to the Georgia Institute of Technology; he initially hoped to study to become an architect, but later changed his course of study to journalism. He registered for the Selective Service System and was given a II-S student deferment. He married Margaret Elizabeth Thompson of Atlanta on November 6, 1966. In January or February 1967, he withdrew from university. He attempted to obtain I-O conscientious objector status, but was denied, and was instead classified I-A (available for induction). After twice being ordered to report for induction, he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in February 1967 and charged with violating the Selective Service Act. He then crossed the border into Canada with his American wife, obtained landed immigrant status there (though not Canadian citizenship), and in May went to the United States Consulate in Toronto and renounced his citizenship. His oath of renunciation was signed before U.S. Consul Richard J. Dols.\n\nJolley later returned to the United States, apparently via Detroit. He then went south and began working as a news reporter for the \"Tallahassee Democrat\" in Tallahassee, Florida, while his wife enrolled in graduate school at Florida State University. After the news of his situation went public, \"Democrat\" managing editor William Phillips, who made the decision to hire Jolley, commented that the paper had received equal numbers of letters of support and hate mail for its decision not to fire Jolley. The U.S. government ordered Jolley deported, but he did not depart the country voluntarily, and so on February 22, 1968, he was again arrested by FBI agents. He was released on a $3,000 bond pending formal deportation proceedings against him. U.S. media described him as a \"draft evader\". Others called him a \"modern-day Philip Nolan\", a reference to the main character of the American Civil War short story \"The Man Without a Country\".\n\nRepresented by attorney Peter Rindskopf, Jolley appealed his case to the Board of Immigration Appeals in April 1969, but the Board ruled against him in March 1970. He appealed again to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which in April 1971 also ruled against him. The court struck down his argument that his renunciation was involuntary because he was being forced into military service, instead ruling that it indeed constituted voluntary relinquishment within the meaning of \"Afroyim v. Rusk\". However, Richard Rives wrote a dissenting opinion arguing that the U.S. government should allow Jolley's appeal and prosecute him for draft evasion instead. Jolley attempted to appeal the Fifth Circuit's ruling to the Supreme Court, but not a single justice recommended granting \"certiorari\", meaning the Court would not hear his case. After this news came out, Jolley stated that he would not pursue further any further legal actions.\n\nJolley was thus declared deportable, but before he could be deported, another country would have to be found to accept him. A spokesman for the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada stated that Jolley may have lost his landed immigrant status due to his long absence from Canada, but he could apply for immigration permission again at a Canadian port of entry. Jolley was given 90 days to voluntarily depart the country, failing which the government would commence removal proceedings on February 7, 1972, but in January that year, Representatives Phillip Burton and Ron Dellums (both D-CA) sponsored separate private bills to grant a green card to Jolley, and the House Committee on the Judiciary asked the Department of Justice to provide a full report about Jolley. The removal process was suspended while the bill was under consideration. The following year, Dellums sponsored another private bill to the same effect, but no further action was taken on it.\n\nBy January 1974, Jolley still had not been deported and was living in Morgantown, West Virginia. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that \"Canada, which has no legal obligation to take Jolley back, does not want him back\", and quoted an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman as stating that the government had \"no choice but to let him live here\". With no country to which he could be deported, it was expected that he might spend the rest of his life living in the United States as a deportable alien.\n\nHe died in Asheville, North Carolina at the age of 70 on March 20, 2014 from undisclosed causes.\n"}
{"id": "1263740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1263740", "title": "Tom Paxton", "text": "Tom Paxton\n\nThomas Richard Paxton (born October 31, 1937) is an American folk singer-songwriter who has had a music career spanning more than fifty years. In 2009, Paxton received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He is noteworthy as a music educator as well as an advocate for folk singers to combine traditional songs with new compositions.\n\nPaxton's songs have been widely covered, including modern standards such as \"The Last Thing on My Mind\", \"Bottle of Wine\", \"Whose Garden Was This\", \"The Marvelous Toy\", and \"Ramblin' Boy\". Paxton's songs have been recorded by Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, The Weavers, Judy Collins, Sandy Denny, Joan Baez, Doc Watson, Harry Belafonte, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Seekers, Marianne Faithfull, The Kingston Trio, the Chad Mitchell Trio, John Denver, Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner, Willie Nelson, Flatt & Scruggs, The Move, The Fireballs, and many others (see covers). He has performed thousands of concerts around the world.\n\nPaxton was born on October 31, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to Burt and Esther Paxton. His father was \"a chemist, mostly self-educated\", and as his health began to fail him, the family moved to Wickenburg, Arizona. It was here that young Paxton began riding horses at the numerous dude ranches in the area. It was also here that he was first introduced to folk music, discovering the music of Burl Ives and others.\n\nIn 1948, the family moved to Bristow, Oklahoma, which Paxton considers to be his hometown. Soon after, his father died from a stroke. Paxton was about fifteen when he received his first stringed instrument, a ukulele. He was given a guitar by his aunt when he was sixteen, and he soon began to immerse himself in the music of Burl Ives and Harry Belafonte.\n\nIn 1955, Paxton enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, where he studied in the drama school. It was here that he first found other enthusiasts of folk music and discovered the music of Woody Guthrie and The Weavers. Paxton would later note, \"Woody was fearless; he'd take on any issue that got him stirred up ... and he became one of my greatest influences.\" In college, he was in a group known as the Travellers, and they sang in an off-campus coffeehouse.\n\nUpon graduating in 1959 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, Paxton acted in summer stock theatre and briefly tried graduate school before joining the Army. While attending the Clerk Typist School in Fort Dix, New Jersey, he began writing songs on his typewriter and spent almost every weekend visiting Greenwich Village in New York City during the emerging early 1960s folk revival.\n\nShortly after his honorable discharge from the Army, Paxton auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio via publisher Milt Okun in 1960. He initially received the part, but his voice did not blend well enough with those of the group members. However, after singing his song \"The Marvelous Toy\" for Okun, he became the first writer signed to Milt's music publishing company, Cherry Lane Music Publishing.\n\nPaxton soon began performing at The Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich Village, where he became a mainstay. In 1962, he recorded a privately produced live album at the Gaslight entitled, \"I'm the Man That Built the Bridges\". During his stay in Greenwich Village, Paxton published some of his songs in the folk magazines \"Broadside\" and \"Sing Out!\", and performed alongside such folksingers as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Eric Andersen, Dave Van Ronk, and Mississippi John Hurt. Paxton met his future wife, Margaret Ann Cummings (known as \"Midge\"), at the Gaslight one night in January 1963 after being introduced to her by David Blue.\n\nPete Seeger picked up on a few of Tom Paxton's songs in 1963, including \"Ramblin' Boy\" (which Seeger performed at The Weavers reunion concert at Carnegie Hall) and \"What Did You Learn in School Today?\" Paxton increased his profile as a performer, appearing at the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, which was recorded by Vanguard Records. A month after Newport in 1963, Paxton married Midge. He began traveling the country on the coffeehouse and small-venue circuit before returning to New York. Paxton became involved with causes that promoted human rights, civil rights and labor rights. In 1963, Paxton and a group of other folk musicians performed and offered moral support to striking coal miners in Hazard, Kentucky. \n\nAfter returning to New York, Paxton signed with Elektra Records in 1964, a label which at that time featured a distinguished roster of folk musicians. He would go on to record seven albums for Elektra. As the folk revival hit its peak, Paxton began getting more work outside of New York City, including benefit concerts and college campus visits. In 1964, he took part in the Freedom Summer and visited the Deep South, with other folk musicians, to perform at voter registration drives and civil rights rallies. His civil rights song \"Beau John\" was written after attending a Freedom Song Workshop in Atlanta, Georgia, and the song \"Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney\" was written about the murders of three civil rights activists (Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney) in the summer of 1964 by members of the Ku Klux Klan near Philadelphia, Mississippi. Paxton's own compositions began to be increasingly recognized within folk music circles, and in other genres.\n\nOf the songwriters on the Greenwich Village scene of the 1960s, Dave Van Ronk said, \"Dylan is usually cited as the founder of the new song movement, and he certainly became its most visible standard-bearer, but the person who started the whole thing was Tom Paxton ... he tested his songs in the crucible of live performance, he found that his own stuff was getting more attention than when he was singing traditional songs or stuff by other people ... he set himself a training regimen of deliberately writing one song every day. Dylan had not yet showed up when this was happening, and by the time Bobby came on the set, with at most two or three songs he had written, Tom was already singing at least 50 percent his own material. That said, it was Bobby's success that really got the ball rolling. Prior to that, the folk community was very much tied to traditional songs, so much so that songwriters would sometimes palm their own stuff off as traditional.\"\n\nIn 1965, Paxton made his first tour of the United Kingdom. The tour was the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met Bruce Woodley, one of the founding members of the Australian folk group The Seekers and they collaborated on the song \"Angeline (Is Always Friday)\" which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group Clear Light recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton's song \"Mr. Blue\" on their only album \"Clear Light\". Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton's recording of \"The Last Thing on My Mind\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts in December 1967. Then in 1968, Paxton scored a Top 10 radio hit when The Fireballs recorded his song \"Bottle of Wine\". In the 1960s, Paxton licensed one of his songs, \"My Dog's Bigger than Your Dog\", for use in a Ken-L Ration dog food commercial. Not too fazed by the success of some of his songs, Paxton continued writing and performing. He was not interested in jumping on the folk rock (or, as he once joked, \"folk rot\") bandwagon though, and continued his folk singer-songwriter style on albums like \"Outward Bound\" (1966) and \"Morning Again\" (1968). On January 20, 1968, three months after the death of Woody Guthrie, Paxton and a number of other prominent folk musicians performed at the Harold Leventhal produced \"A Tribute to Woody Guthrie\" concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall.\n\nPaxton decided to try some more elaborate recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, as well as his acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with \"The Things I Notice Now\" in the summer of 1969, and also charted with \"Tom Paxton 6\" in the spring of the following year. His song \"Whose Garden Was This\", an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver's 1970 album. The diverse \"Baroque Folk\" experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. Regarding this time, he said, \"the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most ... I \"know\" I didn't have that rock mentality or anything. I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma. And I just wanted to hear folk songs.\" Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.\n\nPaxton, his wife and their two daughters lived in Holland Park, London, for about four years in the early 1970s. After a stay in England due to professional success and love of the country, Paxton and Midge went on a tour of New Zealand and China and even appeared on a Chinese talk show. Paxton released \"How Come the Sun\" in 1971. The album gave him his highest chart ranking in the U.S. but it only reached number 120 and his next album, \"Peace Will Come\" (1972), barely even reached the charts. He soon returned to New York City and the Long Island town of East Hampton before moving to the Washington, D.C. area around 1977. After recording three albums for Reprise Records and a few for \"an English label that didn't pan out well\", Paxton signed with Vanguard Records, with whom he recorded a live album with Steve Goodman, \"New Songs From the Briarpatch\" (1977), which contained some of Paxton's topical songs of the 1970s, including \"Talking Watergate\" and \"White Bones of Allende\" as well as a song dedicated to Mississippi John Hurt entitled \"Did You Hear John Hurt?\" In 1978, Paxton released his album \"Heroes\", which contained a song, \"Phil\", about his friend Phil Ochs, who had taken his own life in 1976. The album also includes the song \"The Death of Stephen Biko\", which details the brutal killing of anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko in South Africa. \nPaxton's 1979 album, \"Up and Up\", contains the song \"Let the Sunshine\", which addresses issues concerning environmentalism and solar energy. Paxton has also performed at the Clearwater Festival, an annual event, started by Pete Seeger, dedicated to environmentalism and cleaning up the Hudson River. His 1983 album \"Bulletin\" includes a song about Woody Guthrie entitled \"They Couldn't Take the Music.\"\n\nAfter recording for labels such as Mountain Railroad and Flying Fish in the 1980s, Paxton started his own label, Pax Records, in 1987. It was during this time that Paxton continued to suffer from an undiagnosed and deepening depression that affected his work. With some advice from Midge, he began to look for a solution and was eventually diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, for which he received ongoing treatment.\n\nAs the 1990s rolled around, Paxton began delving deeply into children's music, recording nine children's albums during the decade. In July 1994, Paxton was invited to perform at a folk festival in Israel, \"Jacob's Ladder\", and he played there and a series of concerts around Israel accompanied by folk guitarist and harmonica player Shay Tochner. Paxton recorded a live album in 1996 with his good friend Jim Rooney, and it contained some new comical songs about current events. Eric Weissberg, John Gorka, Robin and Linda Williams, among others, also performed; and the album was titled \"Live: For the Record\". In the mid-1990s, Paxton also began to give more workshops in songwriting. \n\nIn 2000, Paxton once again began to write more of the topical songs that had been prominent during his early career. In 2001, he released an album with Anne Hills entitled \"Under American Skies\", and in 2002, he released an album of all new songs entitled \"Looking for the Moon\" (Appleseed Recordings). At the time of its release, Paxton was quoted saying that it might be his best album so far. \"Looking for the Moon\" contains the song \"The Bravest\", which is about the firefighters who gave their lives while trying to save others in New York City on September 11, 2001. Around this time, Paxton began writing and releasing his \"Short Shelf Life Songs\" about current events for free download on his website. Paxton wrote a number of topical protest songs that were critical of the Bush administration's actions. In 2007, he rewrote a song of his from 1965 entitled \"Lyndon Johnson Told The Nation\", about the escalation of the war in Vietnam, and transformed it into \"George W. Told The Nation\", about the surge in the Iraq war. In 2007, Tom Paxton became one of the founding members of the Copyright Alliance, whose purpose is to promote the cultural and economic benefits of copyrights. \n\nIn 2008, Paxton rewrote his song \"I'm Changing My Name to Chrysler\", about the federal loan guarantee to Chrysler in 1979, as \"I Am Changing My Name to Fannie Mae\", about the 700 billion dollar \"bailout of the U.S. financial system\". He continues to perform yearly tours of the United States and UK. \n\nIn March 2015, Paxton released the studio album \"Redemption Road\". In January 2017, Paxton released \"Boat In The Water\", his sixty-third album.\n\nPaxton is now in \"semi-retirement,\" though he still performs occasional shows and did a 10 venue UK tour in 2017.\n\nPaxton married his wife, Midge, in 1963. They have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate, and three grandsons. Jennifer is a history professor who has published courses for The Teaching Company.\n\nHe has described his political views in the following way: \"My own politics more or less resembled Will Rogers's politics. He had said that he belonged to no organized political party — he was a Democrat ... being young and impassioned almost automatically put me over on the radical side of most issues. Being older, I find myself still more or less there, somewhat to my surprise.\" Midge Paxton died in 2014 after a long illness.\n\nIn February 2002, Paxton was honored with the ASCAP Lifetime Achievement Award in Folk Music. A few days later, he received three Wammies (Washington, DC, Area Music Awards); as Best Male Vocalist in the \"traditional folk\" and \"children's music\" categories, and for Best Traditional Folk Recording of the Year for \"Under American Skies\" (2001). \n\nPaxton has been nominated four times for Grammy Awards, all since 2002.

{"id": "268705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268705", "title": "Wallace Fard Muhammad", "text": "Wallace Fard Muhammad\n\nWallace D. Fard, also known as Wallace Fard Muhammad (Arabic: ولس فرض محمد) (; born February 26, 1877 – circa 1934), was a co-founder of the Nation of Islam. He arrived in Detroit in 1930 with an obscure background and several aliases, and taught an idiosyncratic form of Islam to members of the city's black population. He was also known as being a seller of silk, incense, and perfume and was described as an Arab or Middle Eastern man, but remembered as being a \"light-skinned\" black man by leaders of the Nation of Islam. Fard was last seen in 1933 by Elijah Muhammad, when Fard took off in an airplane from the Detroit airport.\n\nIn 1938, an article by sociologist Erdmann Doane Beynon was published in the \"American Journal of Sociology\", giving Beynon's first-hand account of several interviews that he conducted with followers of Fard in Michigan. From those interviews, Beynon wrote that Fard lived and taught in Detroit from 1930 to 1934. He came to the homes of black families who had recently migrated to Detroit from the rural south. He began by selling silks door to door, telling his listeners that the silks came from their home country. At his suggestion, he came back to teach the residents, along with guests.\n\nIn the early stage of his ministry, Fard \"used the Bible as his textbook, since it was the only religious book with which the majority of his hearers were familiar. With growing prestige over a constantly increasing group, [Fard] became bolder in his denunciation of the Caucasians and began to attack the teachings of the Bible in such a way as to shock his hearers and bring them to an emotional crisis.\"\n\nThose interviewed by Beynon told him that reports of Fard's message spread throughout the black community. Attendance at the house meetings grew until the listeners were divided into groups and taught in shifts. Finally, the community contributed money and rented a hall to serve as a Temple where meetings were conducted. The Quran was soon introduced as the most authoritative of all texts for the study of the faith according to those interviewed by Beynon. Fard prepared texts himself, which served as authoritative manuals of the faith and were memorized verbatim by those who followed him.\n\nFrom his interviews, Beynon described disputes and tension that arose between the new community and the police, surrounding the groups' refusal to send their children to public schools, and members of the group who some alleged to have participated in \"human sacrifice\" in 1932 in an effort to obey lessons given to the community regarding the sacrifice of devils. These incidents drew police attention to the group, according to Beynon, and contributed to persecutions and schisms.\n\nFard named his community the Nation of Islam. Following the rapid increase in membership, Fard instituted a formal organizational structure. He established the University of Islam, where school age children were taught, rather than in the public schools. He established the Moslem Girls' Training and General Civilization Class, where women were taught how to keep their houses, clean, and cook. The men of the organization were drilled by captains and referred to as the Fruit of Islam. The entire movement was placed under a Minister of Islam.\n\nAccording to Beynon, Fard's followers grew to approximately eight thousand. \"Within three years the prophet not only began the movement but organized it so well that he himself was able to recede into the background, appearing almost never to his followers during the final months of his residence in Detroit.\"\n\nFrom interviews with approximately two hundred families who followed Fard, Beynon concluded:Although the prophet lived in Detroit from July 4, 1930 until June 30, 1934, virtually nothing is known about him, save that he \"came from the East\" and that he \"called\" the Negroes of North America to enter the Nation of Islam. His very name is uncertain. He was known usually as Mr. Wali Farrad or Mr. W. D. Fard, though he used also the following names: Professor Ford, Mr. Farrad Mohammed, Mr. F. Mohammed Ali. One of the few survivors who heard his first addresses states that he himself said: \"My name is W.D. Fard and I came from the Holy City of Mecca. More about myself I will not tell you yet, for the time has not yet come. I am your brother. You have not yet seen me in my royal robes.\" Legends soon sprang up about this mysterious personality ...\n\nFard used the name W. F. Muhammad on several lessons written in 1933 and 1934. In 1933, he began signing his name W. F. Muhammad, which stands for Wallace Fard Muhammad.\n\nA declassified Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum dated May 16, 1957 states: \"From a review of instant file it does not appear that there has been a concerted effort to locate and fully identify W. D. Fard. Inasmuch as Elijah Muhammad recognizes W.D. Fard as being Allah (God) and claims that Fard is the source of all of his teachings, it is suggested that an exhaustive effort be made to fully identify and locate W. D. Fard and/or members of his family.\" The FBI took note of the article written by Erdmann Doane Beynon, and it conducted a search for Fard using various aliases including the name \"Ford\".\n\nThe search produced two Fords of interest, one of whom was Wallace Ford, a prominent movie actor. The other was Wallie D. Ford of California, arrested by Los Angeles police on November 17, 1918, on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon; by the Los Angeles police January 20, 1926, for violation of the California Woolwine Possession Act; and by the Los Angeles police on February 15, 1926, for violation of the State Poison Act, for which he was sentenced to six months to six years at San Quentin State Prison on June 12, 1926. According to San Quentin records, Wallie D. Ford was born in Portland, Oregon on February 25, 1891, the white son of Zared and Beatrice Ford, who were both born in Hawaii.\n\nOn October 17, 1957, the FBI located and interviewed Hazel Barton-Ford, Wallie Ford's common-law wife, with whom he had a son named Wallace Dodd Ford, born September 1, 1920. Barton-Ford gave a description of Wallie Ford, and described him as a Caucasian New Zealander. The FBI's search for Fard was officially closed one year later on April 15, 1958.\n\nOn August 15, 1959, the FBI sent a story to the Chicago \"New Crusader\" newspaper, stating that Fard was a \"Turkish-born Nazi agent who worked for Hitler in World War II.\" According to the story from the FBI, Fard was a \"Muslim from Turkey who had come to the United States in the early 1900s. He had met Muhammad in prison … where the two men plotted a confidence game in which followers were charged a fee to become Muslims.\" After the story was published, Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X subsequently charged Black media outlets, who re-printed the accusation in large numbers, with running the story without requesting a response from the Nation of Islam.\n\nA February 19, 1963, FBI memorandum states: \"In connection with efforts to disrupt and curb growth of the NOI, extensive research has been conducted into various files maintained by this office. Among the files reviewed was that of Wallace Dodd Ford.\" Five months later, in July 1963, the FBI told the \"Los Angeles Evening Herald-Examiner\" that Fard was actually Wallace Dodd Ford. The paper published the story in an article titled: \"Black Muslim Founder Exposed As White.\" An FBI memorandum dated the following month, August 1963, states that the FBI had not been able to verify his birth date or birthplace, and \"he was last heard from in 1934.\"\n\nKarl Evanzz of the \"Washington Post\" submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI in 1978 requesting its file on Fard. Evanzz based his account of the life of Fard on the declassified portion of the FBI file that he received about a decade after his request. Evanzz detailed the experience of several other authors who based their accounts of the life of Fard on the FBI file as well.\n\nFrom the FBI's response to the Freedom of Information Act request, Karl Evanzz claimed that Fard, using the name Fred Dodd, married Pearl Allen in Multnomah County, Oregon, on May 9, 1914, with their first child, a son, born the next year.\n\nDodd left his family in 1916 and moved to Los Angeles, using the name Wallie Dodd Ford. A World War I draft registration card for Wallie Dodd Fard from 1917 indicated he was living in Los Angeles, unmarried, as a restaurant owner, and reported that he was born in Shinka, Afghanistan on February 26, 1893. He was described as being of medium height and build with brown eyes and black hair. On the draft card, \"Ford\" is written in parenthesis. No reason is given. At the bottom of the card, he signed his name as \"Wallie Dodd Ford\".\n\nAs of 1920, Ford was still living in Los Angeles, as 26-year-old Wallie D. Ford, with his 25-year-old wife, Hazel. In the 1920 United States Census he reported his race as white, his occupation as a proprietor of a restaurant, and gave his place of birth as New Zealand. He provided no known place of birth for his parents, nor his date of immigration.\n\nA marriage certificate dated June 5, 1924, was issued to Wallie Dodd Ford and Carmen Trevino in Orange County, California. Ford reported he was a cook, age 26, born in Oregon, but living in Los Angeles.\n\nIt has been reported that Ford had roots in what is today Pakistan. His father was Zared Fard, an East Indian; either Zared or his parents immigrated to New Zealand from what is present-day Pakistan. Fard Muhammad's mother Beatrice was a white Englishwoman living in New Zealand.\n\nIn addition to claiming that Fard was Ford, Evanzz also claimed that Fard was once a member of the Moorish Science Temple of America, citing as a primary source the 1945 publication by Arna Bontemps and Jack Conroy titled \"They Seek A City\". Authors have also cited E.U. Essien-Udom for this proposition as well. In his 1962 book titled \"Black Nationalism: The Search for an Identity\", E. U. Essien-Udom included the following passage:\n\nNoble Drew Ali was shot and stabbed in his offices at the Unity Club in Chicago on the night of March 15, 1929 … He was eventually released on bond, but a few weeks later, he died under mysterious circumstances. Some people claim that he died from injuries inflicted by the police while he was in jail. Others, however, suggest that he was killed by [Sheik Claude] Greene's partisans. For some time, one W. D. Fard assumed leadership of the Moorish movement. According to Bontemps and Conroy, Fard claimed that he was the reincarnation of Noble Drew Ali. By 1930 a permanent split developed in the movement. One faction, the Moors, remains faithful to Noble Drew Ali, and the other, which is now led by Elijah Muhammad, remains faithful to Prophet Fard (Master Wallace Fard Muhammad). However, Minister Malcolm X and other leaders of the Nation of Islam have emphatically denied any past connection whatsoever of Elijah Muhammad, Master Wallace Fard Muhammad, or their movement with Nobel Drew Ali's Moorish American Science Temple.\n\nOn the question of a connection between the Nation of Islam and the Moorish Science Temple of America, Beynon wrote the following from his interviews with Fard's followers:\n\nAwakened already to a consciousness of race discrimination, these migrants from the South came into contact with militant movements among northern Negroes. Practically none of them had been in the North prior to the collapse of the Marcus Garvey movement. A few of them had come under the influence of the Moorish-American cult which succeeded it. The effect of both these movements upon the future members of the Nation of Islam was largely indirect. Garvey taught the Negroes that their homeland was Ethiopia. The Noble Drew Ali, the prophet of the Moorish-Americans, proclaimed that these people were \"descendants of Morrocans\".\n\nBeynon also noted: \"The prophet’s message was characterized by his ability to utilize to the fullest measure the environment of his followers. Their physical and economic difficulties alike were used to illustrate the new teaching. Similarly, biblical prophecies and the teachings of Marcus Garvey and Noble Drew Ali were cited as foretelling the coming of the new prophet\".\n\nWith regard to Elijah Muhammad, Beynon's article stated: \"From among the larger group of Muslims there has sprung recently an even more militant branch than the Nation of Islam itself. This new movement, known as the Temple People, identifies the prophet, Mr. W. D. Fard, with the god Allah. To Mr. Fard alone do they offer prayer and sacrifice. Since Mr. Fard has been deified, the Temple People raise to the rank of prophet the former Minister of Islam, Elijah Mohammed, now a resident of Chicago. He is always referred to reverently as the 'Prophet Elijah in Chicago.\n\nElijah Muhammad, who led the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975, heard Fard teach for the first time in 1931. Elijah Muhammad stated that he and Fard became inseparable between 1931 and 1934, where he felt \"jailed almost\" due to the amount of time that they spent together with Fard teaching him day and night.\n\nA hand-written lesson written by Fard states:Twelve Leaders of Islam from all over the Planet have conferred in the Root of Civilization concerning the Lost-Found Nation of Islam – must return to their original Land. One of the Conference Members by the name of Mr. Osman Sharrieff said to the Eleven Members of the Conference: \"The Lost-Found Nation of Islam will not return to their original Land unless they, first, have a thorough Knowledge of their own.\" So they sent a Messenger to them of their own. Now, the Messenger and his Laborers worked day and night for the last three and one-half years, and their accomplishments are approximately twenty-five thousand ...\n\nIn this lesson, Fard places the number of converts obtained in Detroit at twenty-five thousand, and he describes a \"Messenger\" sent to the \"Lost-Found Nation of Islam\" who is \"of their own\". Nation of Islam theology states that this \"Messenger\" is Elijah Muhammad.\n\nFard wrote, in his instructions to the leaders of his community, that they should \"copy the Answers of Lesson of Minister Elijah Muhammad.\" He went on to state: \"Why is Stress made to the Muslims to Copy, the Minister, Elijah Muhammad's Answers? The past History shows that the ALMIGHTY ALLAH sends Prophets and Apostles for the people's Guide and Example, and through them HIS Mystery was Revealed. And those who follow the Apostle would see the Light.\"\n\nFard wrote several lessons which are read and committed to memory by members of the Nation of Islam. Some of the lessons are in the form of questions asked by Fard to Elijah Muhammad. One such lesson concludes with the text: \"This Lesson No. 2 was given by our Prophet, W.D. Fard, which contains 40 questions answered by Elijah Muhammad, one of the lost found in the wilderness of North America February 20th, 1934.\"\n\nBeynon described the substance of Fard's teaching as follows:The black men in North America are not Negroes, but members of the lost tribe of Shabazz, stolen by traders from the Holy City of Mecca 379 years ago. The prophet came to America to find and to bring back to life his long lost brethren, from whom the Caucasians had taken away their language, their nation and their religion. Here in America they were living other than themselves. They must learn that they are the original people, noblest of the nations of the earth. The Caucasians are the colored people, since they have lost their original color. The original people must regain their religion, which is Islam, their language, which is Arabic, and their culture, which is astronomy and higher mathematics, especially calculus. They must live according to the law of Allah, avoiding all meat of \"poison animals\", hogs, ducks, geese, possums and catfish. They must give up completely the use of stimulants, especially liquor. They must clean themselves up – both their bodies and their houses. If in this way they obeyed Allah, he would take them back to the Paradise from which they had been stolen – the Holy City of Mecca.\n\nFard's lessons actually state that the \"trader\" referenced by Beynon, came to Africa, not Mecca.\n\nModern Nation of Islam theology is based upon the belief that Fard's teaching of Elijah Muhammad was fulfillment of scripture regarding God's teaching of an Apostle, where Fard is described as \"God in Person\", the \"Messiah\", and the \"Mahdi\". Fard wrote the following for his followers:[T]he LESSONS that OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH) gave us to Study and Learn is the Fulfillment of the Prophecies of All the Former Prophets concerning the Beginning of the Devils, and the Ending of the Civilization, and of our Enslavement by the Devils, and Present Time of our Delivery from the Devils by OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH). PRAISE HIS HOLY NAME! There is No God but ALLAH. How that ALLAH would separate us from the Devils and, then destroy them; and Change us into a New and Perfect People; and Fill the Earth with FREEDOM, JUSTICE and EQUALITY as it was filled with wickedness; and Making we, the Poor Lost-Founds, the Perfect RULERS.\n\nIn his 1965 book \"Message to the Blackman in America\", which is a compilation of articles written by Elijah Muhammad for various newspapers throughout the early part of his Ministry, he summarized what Fard taught him as follows:He began teaching us the knowledge of ourselves, of God and the devil, of the measurement of the earth, of other planets, and of the civilization of some of the planets other than earth. ... He measured and weighed the earth and its water; the history of the moon; the history of the two nations, black and white, that dominate the earth. He gave the exact birth of the white race; the name of their God who made them and how; and the end of their time, the judgment, how it will begin and end. ... He taught us the truth of how we were made \"slaves\" and how we are kept in slavery by the \"slave-masters children. He declared the doom of America, for her evils to us was past due. And that she is number one to be destroyed. Her judgment could not take place until we hear the truth. ...\n\nHe declared that we were without the knowledge of self or anyone else. How we had been made blind, deaf and dumb by this white race of people and how we must return to our people, our God and His religion of peace (Islam), the religion of the prophets. We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed from the face of the earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He declared that he would heal us and set us in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.\n\nHe was also noted for his anti-Hindu sentiments, scholar A. James Gregor stating that: \"Fard taught Elijah Muhammad than the Messenger’s entirely negative references to Hindus. Fard, as a Muslim in what was to become Pakistan, bore an irrepressible prejudice against Hindus\".\n\nFard appears in the novel \"Middlesex\", by Jeffrey Eugenides, in which Fard's Detroit Temple No. 1 is the location setting for several scenes in the book. Fard's teaching are also referenced in popular music, particularly in hip-hop, by those influenced by the Nation of Islam and the Five Percent Nation. Artists who have made references within their music include: Jay-Z (\"I'm going to chase the Yacub back in the cave\"), Jay Electronica (\"Lost tribe of Shabazz stylin' on the record\", \"The son of W.D., who hung around in the D, Who ran around in the three, The trap gods raised me, Face all on the Sphinx, Story all in the wall of the pyramids, Niggas know the Black God saved me\"), Brand Nubian (\"This asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards, The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet earth, Father of civilization, God of the universe, Manifestin thought with my infinite styles, Making sure this travels twenty-three million miles, The other six I set the crucifix, Because the heart of the problem is this...\"). Similar quotes appear in music of artists such as Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane, Kanye West, Wu-Tang Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers (\"Holy Intellect\"), A Tribe Called Quest, Ice Cube (\"Horny Lil Devil\"), Rakim (\"Mystery (Who Is God?)\"), K-Rino (\"Point number 12\"), and others.\n\n\n\n"}
