His circle of friends included important literary figures like Blaise Cendrars and James Joyce.\n\nAugust Suter was born at Basel, the son of Johannes Suter (1857–1907) a bookbinder from Eptingen and Katharina Suter-Schaub (1859–1941). After an apprenticeship as a bookbinder with his father and courses in painting and drawing at the Basel Gewerbeschule (vocational school) he worked for local sculptor Carl Gutknecht (1878–1970), before he went to the Académie Julian in Paris in 1910. But he soon became an independent artist there and formed lifelong friendships with the writer Blaise Cendrars and the English painter Frank Budgen, who worked as a model for him. Cendrars was later to write a successful novel (\"L'Or\") about Suter’s grandfather, Johann August of gold rush fame. Rodo (Auguste de Niederhäusern) advised him to whole-heartedly turn to sculpture. A long-standing friend was the Swiss poet and translator . Shortly before the War he also became acquainted with the German writer and anarchist . During the World War I Suter worked in Basel and Zurich, where he, his brother Paul and Frank Budgen got to know the exiled Irish writer James Joyce. He married singer Helene Moser (1893–1965) in 1917 and had three sons. From 1921 to 1939 Suter lived in Paris again and befriended the sculptor Charles Despiau, whose studio lay next to his. After World War II he worked intermittently in Paris and Basel, where he died at the age of 79 just months after his wife.\n\nSuter's naturalistic work is dominated by male and female nudes, figure compositions, portrait busts and architectural sculpture. In 1925 called him “the most important sculptor of our time”. At first he was influenced by Rodin and Bourdelle, but turned to Maillol's classicism in the fourth decade of his life. Art historian points out an important difference to Rodin: \"where Rodin seizes impetuously, he waits calmly, and everytime he imbeds the unique rhythm of a particular life into the specific rhythm of his composition\". Suters most famous sculpture is the memorial “Prometheus and the Soul” for the Swiss Nobel Prize poet Carl Spitteler at Liestal near Basel, which he worked on from 1926 to 1931.\n\nAn unburned clay sculpture of James Joyce did not survive World War II.\n\nSuter’s son Claude donated his father's artistic legacy to the Basel municipality of Eptingen where it is accessible on request (museum@eptingen.ch). The August-Suter-Museum is situated at the old schoolhouse Schulstraße 5, Eptingen.\n\n<gallery>\nSuter Cendrars.jpg|Portrait bust (destroyed) of Blaise Cendrars (around 1911)\nFrutiger Ringgenberg.jpg|Karl Frutiger, farmer at Ringgenberg (1912)\nElla Schwartz bust.jpg|Bronze bust of Ella Schwartz (1929)\nFleiner Grave.jpg|Grave figure of \n"}
{"id": "44242617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44242617", "title": "Baal Shem Tov", "text": "Baal Shem Tov\n\nIsrael ben Eliezer (born circa 1698, died 22 May 1760), known as the Baal Shem Tov (, ) or as the Besht, was a Jewish mystical rabbi considered the founder of Hasidic Judaism. \"Besht\" is the acronym for Baal Shem Tov, which means \"Master of the Good Name\" or \"one with a good reputation\". \n\nThe little biographical information about the Besht comes from oral traditions handed down by his students (Jacob Joseph of Polonne and others) and from the legendary tales about his life and behavior collected in \"Shivḥei ha-Besht\" (\"In Praise of the Ba'al Shem Tov\"; Kapust and Berdychiv, 1814–15). Hasidim approach these legends with a blend of suspicion and belief. Rebbe Shlomo Rabinowicz of Rodomsk declared, \"Whoever believes all the miracle stories about the Baal Shem Tov in \"Shivhei HaBaal Shem Tov\" is a fool, but whoever denies that he could have done them is an \"apikoros\" [a heretic]\". Similarly, the Rebbe Mordechai of Neshkiz explains, \"Even if a story about him never actually occurred, and there was no such miracle, it was in the power of the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing for the life of the World-to-Come, to perform everything\".\n\nA central tenet in the Baal Shem Tov's teaching is the direct connection with the divine, \"dvekut\", which is infused in every human activity and every waking hour. Prayer is of supreme importance, along with the mystical significance of Hebrew letters and words. His innovation lies in \"encouraging worshipers to follow their distracting thoughts to their roots in the divine\".\nThose who follow his teachings regard him as descended from the Davidic line that traces its lineage to the royal house of David.\n\nYisroel (Israel) was born to poor parents Eliezer and Sarah in a settlement near Okopy Świętej Trójcy, a newly built fortress close to Kameniec in West Ukraine, where Zbruch connects with Dniester. Today, Okopy is a village in the Borschiv Raion of the Ternopil Oblast.\n\nHe died in Medzhybizh , which was part of Poland and today is situated in the Khmelnytskyi Oblast (Ukraine) (not to be confused with other cities of the same name).\n\nIn 1703, Israel became an orphan, and was adopted by the Jewish community of Tluste (near Zalischyky). It is reported that, after the conclusion of his studies at the local \"cheder\" (Jewish elementary school), he would often wander into the fields and forests that surrounded the village. In 1710, he finished \"cheder\" and became an assistant to a \"melamed\" (instructor in \"cheder\"). Sometime in 1712 Israel became a \"shammash\" (sexton) of the local synagogue.\n\nHe was hired as a teacher's assistant in the \"cheders\" of the small villages through which they passed. He later related that he took great pleasure in accompanying the children to and from school, using this opportunity to recite prayers with them and tell them Torah stories. The Mezritcher Maggid, the Baal Shem Tov's successor, would later say, \"If only we kissed a Torah scroll with the same love that my master [the Baal Shem Tov] kissed the children when he took them to cheder as a teacher's assistant!\"\n\nAccording to Hasidic legend, the Baal Shem Tov would have visions in which the prophet Achiya Hashiloni would appear to him. In 1716 the Baal Shem Tov married, but soon his wife died and he went on traveling throughout Eastern Galicia. After serving for a long time as helper in various small communities of West Ukraine, he settled as a \"melamed\" at Tluste.\n\nThe Besht was introduced to Kabbalah by Rabbi Adam Baal Shem of Ropczyce () who was a disciple of Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem (I) of Zamość (), the successor of Rabbi Eliyahu Baal Shem of Worms ().\n\nThe Besht became the leader of this movement at the age of 18. Caring for the Jewish poor, the group of Tzadikim encouraged Jews to move to agrarian lifestyles as alternatives to the chronic poverty of city Jews. In continuation of this policy they decided that they needed to look after the educational needs of the children living in small farm communities. If a suitable teacher could not be sourced they themselves would provide one, and therefore the Baal Shem Tov became a teacher's assistant. He later commented \"The most joyous time in my life was teaching the small children how to say Modeh Ani, Shema Yisrael and Kametz Alef Ah\".\n\nHe was chosen by people conducting suits against each other to act as their arbitrator and mediator. His services were brought into frequent requisition because the Jews had their own civil courts in Poland. He is said to have made such an impression on Ephraim of Brody that the latter promised the Besht his daughter Chana in marriage. The man died, however, without telling his daughter of her betrothal; but when she heard of her father's wishes, she agreed to comply with them.\n\nAfter their marriage the couple moved to a village in the Carpathians between Kuty and Kassowa, where their only income was from his work digging clay and lime, which his wife delivered to surrounding villages. The couple had two children: Udl (born in 1720) and Zvi Hersh.\n\nThe Besht later took a position as a shohet (ritual butcher) in Kshilowice, near Iaslowice, which he soon gave up in order to manage a village tavern that his brother-in-law bought for him. During the many years that he lived in the woods and came into contact with the peasants, he had learned how to use plants for healing purposes. In fact, his first appearance in public was that of an “ordinary” Baal Shem. He wrote amulets and prescribed cures.\n\nAfter many trips in Podolia and Volhynia as a Baal Shem, Besht, considering his following large enough and his authority established, decided about 1740 to expound his teachings in the shtetl of Medzhybizh and people, mostly from the spiritual elite, came to listen to him. Medzhybizh became the seat of the movement and of the Medzybizh Hasidic dynasty. His following gradually increased, and with it the hostility of the Talmudists. Nevertheless, Besht was supported at the beginning of his career by two prominent Talmudists, the brothers Meïr (chief rabbi of Lemberg and later Ostroha, and author of \"Meir Netivim\" (a work of halachic responsa) and other works) and Isaac Dov Margalios. Later he won over recognized rabbinic authorities who became his disciples and attested to his scholarship. These include Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Hakohen, rabbi of Polnoy; Rabbi Dovid Halperin, rabbi of Ostroha; Rabbi Israel of Satinov, author of \"Tiferet Yisrael\"; Rabbi Yoseph Heilperin of Slosowitz; and Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezrich (AKA the \"Maggid of Mezritch\"). It is chiefly due to the later that Besht's doctrines (though in an essentially altered form) were introduced into learned Jewish religious circles.\n\nIsrael undertook journeys in which he is recorded as effecting cures, and expelling demons and evil spirits (shaydim). Later Hasidic tradition, however, downplayed the importance of these healing and magical practices, concentrating on his teachings, his charm, magnetism, and ecstatic personality.\n\nOver the past few years, the \"Agudas Ohalei Tzadikim\" organization (based in Israel) has restored many graves of Tzadikim (Ohelim) in Ukraine, including the Baal Shem Tov's. A guesthouse and synagogue are located next to the Ohel of Baal Shem Tov, and the Baal Shem Tov's synagogue in the village proper has been painstakingly restored. Both synagogues are used by the many visitors from all over the world who come to pray near the Baal Shem Tov's grave.\n\nThe Besht took sides with the Talmudists in their disputes against the Frankists (Jacob Frank's cultist movement which regarded Frank as the Messiah, modeled after Sabbatai Zevi.) After the mass conversion of the Frankists, the Baal Shem Tov allegedly said that as long as a diseased limb is connected with the body, there is hope that it may be saved; but, once amputated, it is gone, and there is no hope. It is alleged that he died out of grief that the Frankists left Judaism. \n\nIsrael ben Eliezer left no books; for the Kabbalistic commentary on Psalm 107, ascribed to him (Zhitomir, 1804), \"Sefer mi-Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem-tov,\" may not be genuine. Therefore, the most reliable record of his teachings is in his utterances as recorded in the works of his disciples (Hasidim). Most are found in the works of Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polnoy. But since Hasidism, immediately after the death of its founder, was divided into various parties, each claiming for itself the authority of Besht, the utmost of caution is necessary in judging as to the authenticity of utterances ascribed to Besht.\nSome direct historical evidence remains of the Besht during the days he lived in Medzhybizh. Rosman discovered numerous legal documents that shed light on this period from the Polish Czartoryski noble family archives. The Besht's house is mentioned on several tax registers where it is recorded as having tax-free status. Several of the Besht's colleagues in his stories from Shivhei HaBesht also appear in Polish court records, notably, Ze'ev Wolf Kitzes and Dovid Purkes. Rosman contends that the Polish documents show the Besht and his followers were not outcasts or pariahs, but rather a respected part of mainstream Jewish communal life.\n\nOther direct evidence includes the Besht's daily prayer-book (siddur, owned by the Agudas Chabad Library in New York) with his handwritten personal notes in the margins. His grave can be seen today in the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhybizh.\n\nChapin and Weinstock contend that the Besht was essentially the right person, in the right place, at the right time. 18th century Podolia was an ideal place to foster a sea-change in Jewish thinking. It had been depopulated one generation earlier due to the Khmelnitsky Massacres. A Turkish occupation of Podolia occurred within the Besht's lifetime and along with it the influence within this frontier territory of Sabbatai Zevi and his latter day spiritual descendants such as Malach and Jacob Frank. Once the Polish Magnates regained control from the Turks, Podolia went through an economic boom. The Magnates were benevolent to the economic benefits the Jews provided, and encouraged Jewish resettlement to help protect the frontier from future invasions. Thus, the Jewish community itself was essentially starting over. Within this context, the Jews of Podolia were open to new ideas. The Besht's refreshing new approaches to Judaism were welcome, expanding with little resistance in a community hungry for change.\n\nThe Besht was a mystic who claimed to have achieved \"devekut\" (“adhesion”), meaning that his soul had reached the high level where he could speak with the Messiah, and intervene between humans and God. He had the ability to protect the Jewish community from plague and persecution.\n\nAccording to a letter from the Besht's brother-in-law to the Besht himself—as interpreted by —the latter was a practitioner of prophecy, being able to see a messianic figure arrive in Jerusalem despite living far from the city; the brother-in-law claims to have inquired into the figure and discovered the Besht's vision to be true. This claim also supports the supposed belief that the Besht had the ability to see the souls of men, divining the messianic quality of the man despite only seeing him through a vision. Rosman also describes another letter written by the brother-in-law which claims that the Besht could travel to heaven and commune with God. This view is derived from a series of titles given to the Besht, attributing various religious achievements unto him such as understanding the mysteries of God. Similarly, Rosman—though now citing the writings of a Polish rabbi—says that it was believed the Besht was a great medical practitioner with vast knowledge regarding salves, balms, and similar medicants. Some aspects of his medical practice are said to have been mystic in nature, though the degree to which this is the case is not agreed upon. Some claim that the Besht could only heal others through prayer and similar acts: recitation of holy words. In other works, he is said to have less limitations on his supposed ability, allowing for more mystic methods to be practiced.\n\nAlthough the teachings of the Ba’al Shem Tov derive to some extent from the Kabbalah and frequently employ kabbalistic terminology, he added an emphasis on personal existence and the salvation of the soul of the individual, as a requirement for the redemption of the world: “For before one prays for general redemption one must pray for the personal salvation of one’s own soul” (\"Toledot Ya’akov Yosef\"). He emphasised the personal against a previous preoccupation on messianism. In a letter to Abraham Gershon (dated 1751), he describes his dialogue with the Messiah during a spiritual ascent on Rosh Ha-Shanah, 1747: “I asked the Messiah, ‘When will you come, master,’ and he answered me, ‘When your learning will be made known and revealed to the world and its source will spread and all can recite yiḥudim and experience spiritual ascent as you can…’ and I was astonished and deeply grieved by this, and wondered when this would come to pass” (\"Ben Porat Yosef\").\n\nAt the core of the Besht's teaching is the principle of \"devekut\", and he demanded that \"devekut\" exist in all daily acts and in social contacts. Man must worship God not only when practicing religious acts and holy deeds, but also in his daily affairs, in his business, and in social contacts, for when a “man is occupied with material needs, and his thought cleaves to God, he will be blessed” (\"Ketonet Passim\" (1866), 28a). This belief is linked with the Lurianic doctrine of the raising of the holy sparks (niẓoẓot), though he limited this concept to the salvation of the individual soul. Because of his emphasis on \"devekut\", he did not advocate withdrawal from daily life and society, and he vigorously opposed fasts and asceticism.\n\nHe believed that physical pleasure can give rise to spiritual pleasure. A physical act can become a religious act if it is performed as worship of God and the act is performed in a state of \"devekut\".\n\nThe study of Torah is of prime importance in his teachings, although he interpreted the traditional ideal of “Torah for its own sake” as “for the sake of the letter.” Through contemplation of the letters of the text man can open the divine worlds before him. He based this belief on the assumption that the letters of the Torah evolved and descended from a heavenly source, and therefore by contemplating the letters, one can restore them to their spiritual, and divine source. The student thus becomes joined to their higher forms and receives mystical revelations.\n\nSimilarly, through prayer, a man can reach \"devekut\" and contact with the divine, by concentrating on the mystical meaning of the letters:\n\nThe Besht's concept of the zaddik is of the existence of superior individuals whose spiritual qualities are greater than those of other human beings and who are outstanding in their higher level of \"devekut\". These individuals influence society, and their task is to teach the people to worship God by means of \"devekut\" and to lead sinners to repent.\n\nThe later developments of Hasidism are unintelligible without consideration of Besht's opinion concerning man's proper relation with the universe. True worship of God, consists in the cleaving to, and the unification with, God. To use his own words, “the ideal of man is to be a revelation himself, clearly to recognize himself as a manifestation of God.” Mysticism, he said, is not the Kabbalah, which everyone may learn; but that sense of true oneness, which is usually as strange, unintelligible, and incomprehensible to mankind as dancing is to a dove. However, the man who is capable of this feeling is endowed with a genuine intuition, and it is the perception of such a man which is called prophecy, according to the degree of his insight. From this it results, in the first place, that the ideal man may lay claim to authority equal, in a certain sense, to the authority of the Prophets. This focus on oneness and personal revelation helps earn his mystical interpretation of Judaism the title of Panentheism.\n\nA second and more important result of the doctrine is that through his oneness with God, man forms a connecting link between the Creator and creation. Thus, slightly modifying the Bible verse, Hab. , Besht said, “The righteous can vivify by his faith.“ Besht's followers enlarged upon this idea and consistently deduced from it the source of divine mercy, of blessings, of life; and that therefore, if one love him, one may partake of God's mercy.\n\nOn the opposite side of the coin, the Baal Shem Tov warned the Hasidim:\n\nIt may be said of Hasidism that there is no other Jewish sect in which the founder is as important as his doctrines. Besht himself is still the real center for the Hasidim; his teachings have almost sunk into oblivion. As Schechter (“\"Studies in Judaism\",” p. 4) observes: “To the Hasidim, Baal-Shem [Besht] ... was the incarnation of a theory, and his whole life the revelation of a system.”\n\nBesht did not combat rabbinical Judaism, but the spirit of its practice. His teachings being the result of a deep, religious temperament, he stressed the spirit. Though he considered the Law to be holy and inviolable, and he emphasized the importance of Torah-study, he held that one's entire life should be a service of God. Hasidic legend tells of a woman whom her relatives sought to kill on account of her shameful life, but who was saved in body and soul by Besht. The story is said to be characteristic of Besht's activity in healing those in need of relief. More important to him than prayer was a friendly relationship with sinners. Unselfishness and high-minded benevolence are a motif in the legends about him.\n\nBesht's methods of teaching differed from those of his opponents. He directed many satirical remarks at them, a characteristic one being his designation of the typical Talmudist of his day as “a man who through sheer study of the Law has no time to think about God”. Besht is reported to have illustrated his views of asceticism by the following parable:\n\nBesht held a firm conviction that God had entrusted him with a special mission to spread his doctrines. He believed that he had heavenly visions revealing this mission to him. For him every intuition was a divine revelation; and divine messages were daily occurrences. An example of the power of his spiritual vision is found in the beginning of his grandson's work, \"Degel\", where he writes that his grandfather wrote to Gershon Kitover who lived in Israel, asking him why he was not in Israel that particular Shabbos.\n\nIn Hasidic tradition, there's a saying, “Someone who believes in all the stories of the Baal Shem Tov and the other mystics and holy men is a fool; someone who looks at any single story and says “That one could not be true” is a heretic.”\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopaedia Judaica\" the number of legends that are told relating to the Ba’al Shem Tov have 'distorted his historical character.' An anthology of legends about him was first compiled by Dov Baer b. Samuel of Linits, who was the son-in-law of Alexander Shoḥat, who had acted for several years as the Besht's scribe. The collection was copied many times and over time it became filled with errors. It was printed with the title, \"Shivḥei ha-Besht\" after Dov Baer's death. It was published by Israel Jaffe who rewrote the first chapter, and removed what he considered to be the distortions caused by copyists.\n\nThis edition, printed in Kopys (Kapust) in 1814, contains 230 stories grouped by common themes, characters, and motifs. Two editions also appeared in Yiddish that differ markedly from the Hebrew edition.\n\nIn the 19th century several further collections of legends about the Ba’al Shem Tov, and his followers appeared, in Hebrew and Yiddish, some of which repeated stories found in \"Shivḥei ha-Besht\" and some of which contained new stories. According to the \"Encyclopaedia Judaica\" only a few of these stories can actually be regarded as true.\n\nOne legend tells that his father, Eliezer, was seized during an attack, carried from his home in Wallachia, and sold as a slave to a prince. On account of his wisdom, he found favor with the prince, who gave him to the king to be his minister. During an expedition undertaken by the king, when other counsel failed, and all were disheartened, Eliezer's advice was accepted; and the result was a successful battle of decisive importance. Eliezer was made a general and afterward prime minister, and the king gave him the daughter of the viceroy in marriage. But, being mindful of his duty as a Jew and as he was already married, he married the princess only in name. After being questioned for a long time as to his strange conduct, he confessed to the princess that he was a Jew, who loaded him with costly presents and helped him escape to his own country.\n\nOn the way, the prophet Elijah is said to have appeared to Eliezer and said: “On account of thy piety and steadfastness, thou wilt have a son who will lighten the eyes of all Israel; and Israel shall be his name, because in him shall be fulfilled the verse (Isaiah ): ’Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’” Eliezer and his wife Sarah, however, reached old age childless and had given up all hope of ever having a child. But when they were nearly a hundred years old, the promised son (Besht) was born.\nThe Baal Shem Tov directly imparted his teachings to his students, some of whom founded their own Hasidic dynasties. \n\n\nA portrait by John Singleton Copley is often mistaken to be that of Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, also known as the Baal Shem Tov. It is, in fact, a portrait of Hayyim Samuel Jacob Falk, who was known as the Baal Shem of London.\n\n\nThe chief source for the Besht's biography is Ber (Dov) ben Shmuel’s \"Shivchei ha-Besht\", Kopys, 1814, and frequently republished, and traditions recorded in the works of various Hasidic dynasties — especially by the leaders of the Chabad movement.\n\n\nTzava’at HaRivash and Keter Shem Tov are the most popular anthologies and have been reprinted numerous times. All editions until recently are corrupt, with numerous omissions, printing errors and confused citations. Both texts have now appeared in critical annotated editions with extensive corrections of the texts.

As a teenager, she founded OneChild, a non-governmental organization which seeks to eliminate the commercial sexual exploitation of children abroad. For her work, and in particular her achievements at a young age, Perera has received several accolades.\n\nPerera first became involved in children's rights advocacy work after researching child sexual exploitation and sex tourism in Thailand for a high school class project. In 2002, at 17, she took three-and-a-half months off from school to continue her research in her parents' home country, Sri Lanka. Shocked at the ease with which children could be exploited, she met with a Sri Lankan Presidential Advisor and the National Child Protection Authority to discuss the problems she saw.\n\nThe meeting led her to serve as bait herself in a sting operation to catch a sexual predator. Perera met with a man who had posted a solicitation for a 15-year-old girl on the Internet. After leading him to talk about his intentions on tape, they went to a nearby hotel where police were waiting to make the arrest.\n\nBack in Canada, Perera founded OneChild, a youth-driven and youth-run non-profit organization, in 2005. She was successful in lobbying the Canadian Tourism Board and the travel industry to take measures against child sexual tourism abroad, like showing a video about child sex tourism on some Air Canada flights.\n\nPerera has taken her advocacy to several countries struggling with sex tourism and human trafficking. In 2006 she went with a group to the Philippines to meet with the People's Recovery, Empowerment and Development Assistance Foundation (PREDA), an organization which provides support for former sex workers, and to provide monetary support for the creation of a rehabilitation center for rescued children. In 2010 she traveled to Pattaya, Thailand and other sex tourism destinations in Thailand and Southeast Asia, meeting with agencies to learn more about local issues, efforts, and where help is needed.\n\nFor her activism and role in the law enforcement operation, Perera was given the title \"President's Nominee on Child Protection\", a permanent placement in the Presidential Secretariat.

Right to Protection and Right to Participation are respected. This can only be done in collaboration with government and political leaders to effectively implement policies and schemes.\n\nFive Government-sponsored child development programmes have been prioritized for this initiative. The five priorities are i) a reduction of neonatal deaths, ii) reduction of stunting, iii) reduction of open defecation, iv) enrollment of all children in school and learning institutes and v) protection of children from violence and exploitation.\n\nThis is world’s one of such project which focuses on empowering children by sensitizing all stakeholders including parents, teachers, law enforcement, local government officials and elected public representatives. Under the project, 126 children, and adolescent collectives have been formed in 40 panchayats and one urban local body of the Khandapada Assembly constituency. 40 GPRPs have been trained to create child clubs, disseminate information and train parents in child rights. These have become catalysts to ensure facilitation of child rights. They now plan to constitute child and adolescent organizations in all the 316 villages of the Khandapada Assembly constituency. Some representatives of these organizations of children and adolescents officially participated in special ‘gram sabha’ meetings organized on 2 October 2016, the Gandhi Jayanti day. \nKhandapada MLA Anubhav Patnaik was invited by International Association for Adolescent Health (IAAH) to share his experience of CFC. \n\nSujeet Kumar received Odisha Youth Inspiration Award in Public Policy for his pioneering advisory and lead mentor role in conceptualizing and driving the Child-Friendly Constituency (CFC) at Kalinga Kusum Foundation (KKF).\n\n"}

He then joined Radio Luxembourg at the age of eighteen in November 1968, joining Paul Kay, Paul Burnett, Noel Edmonds and Tony Prince as the resident DJ team. His recruitment was part of the \"all-live\" initiative, bringing to an end most of the pre-recorded shows.\n\nHis initial slot was 1am to 3am Monday to Thursday, and 7pm to 9pm Sunday evenings, but was quickly promoted at the start of 1969 to an earlier slot, mostly starting at 9pm. Being only 18 years old, Paul Burnett affectionately called him the \"kid\" and the name \"Kid\" Jensen was being widely used in newspaper listings by February 1969. From May 1970 he presented a popular progressive rock show, typically broadcast at midnight or 1am, later billed as \"Dimensions\" which resulted in a big increase in listeners to this slot.\n\nBy 1974, Jensen was becoming a TV personality in Britain, hosting pop shows on ITV, and in the mid-1970s he worked for the then-new Radio Trent (now Capital East Midlands) in Nottingham, one of the first legal, land-based commercial radio stations in the UK. During the early part of his career he was billed as \"Kid Jensen\" and did not use his given name professionally until 1980.\n\nIn 1976 he joined the BBC's pop network, Radio 1, initially hosting a Saturday morning show from 10am to midday, but sitting in for many other DJs, and eventually graduating to a weekday late afternoon/early evening show in the spring of 1978 from 4:30 to 7:00pm. He kept his profile high through regular appearances presenting \"Top of the Pops\", and championed many acts who went on to achieve huge commercial success, notably The Police and Gary Numan.\n\nIn September 1980, Jensen left the BBC to work for the Turner Broadcasting System WTBS cable superstation in Atlanta, Georgia where he was host of the 10:00pm nightly news, but he returned a year later, presenting the Radio 1 weekday evening show from 810pm; later extended to run from 710pm. Soon afterwards he dropped the \"Kid\" name, although he would still be popularly known by it for many years to come. His mid-evening show was dominated by indie-rock, but also featured interviews with mainstream acts such as Duran Duran, and was the first show to champion Frankie Goes to Hollywood, before their commercial success. He remained a regular \"Top of the Pops\" presenter and struck up a famous partnership with John Peel. He also wrote a pop column for the \"Daily Mirror\".\n\nIn 1984, Jensen quit Radio 1 and joined London's Capital FM, presenting the weekday mid-morning show (replacing Michael Aspel); moving to weekday drivetime in 1987. In addition to his weekday shows he also presented the weekly \"The Network Chart Show\", the UK's first syndicated commercial radio show which originally went out every Sunday between 5pm and 7pm, competing directly with Radio 1's Top 40 show.\n\nWhile presenting the \"Network Chart\", Jensen became ITV's unofficial \"face\" of pop music, presenting pop shows such as \"The Roxy\" (an attempt to compete with \"Top of the Pops\"). He continued to comment regularly on pop-related stories in ITN and Sky News bulletins for some time after he left the \"Network Chart\" in 1993, when he was replaced by Neil Fox.

Active since 1948, he began his career as part of the duo Rusty and Doug, along with his brother, Rusty Kershaw. He had an extensive solo career that included fifteen albums and singles that charted on the Hot Country Songs charts. He is also a member of the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, being inducted in 2009.\n\nBorn in an unincorporated community called Tiel Ridge in Cameron Parish, Kershaw did not learn English until the age of eight. By that time, he had mastered the fiddle, which he played from the age of five, and was on his way to teaching himself to play 28 instruments. His first gig was at a local bar, the Bucket of Blood, where he was accompanied by his mother on guitar.\n\nKershaw became interested in Cajun music during parties his parents would host on the family's houseboat in Louisiana, where he first heard Cajun bands playing the music.\n\nDoug grew up surrounded by Cajun fiddle and accordion music. After teaching his brother, Rusty, to play guitar, he formed a band, the Continental Playboys, with Rusty and older brother Nelson \"Peewee\" Kershaw in 1948. With the departure of Peewee from the group, in the early 1950s, Rusty & Doug continued to perform as a duo. In 1955, when Kershaw was nineteen, he and Rusty performed on the \"Louisiana Hayride\" KWKH radio broadcast in Shreveport, Louisiana. The two also performed at the WWVA Jamboree (later renamed Jamboree U.S.A.), in Wheeling, West Virginia.\n\nAlthough the brothers initially sang in French, J. D. \"Jay\" Miller, owner of the Feature Records label, persuaded them to incorporate songs in English into their repertoire. In 1955, Doug and Rusty recorded their first single, \"So Lovely, Baby.\" Released on the Hickory label, the tune went to number 14 on the country music charts. Later that same year, Doug and Rusty were invited to become cast members of the \"Louisiana Hayride\" cast. The Kershaws appeared at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee and became regular members of the Opry cast the following year.\n\nDespite the demands of his music career, Doug enrolled in McNeese State University, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where he earned an undergraduate degree in Mathematics. At the peak of their early career, in 1958, Doug and Rusty both enlisted in the United States Army. They devoted their attention to the military until their discharge three years later.\n\nAfter fulfilling their military obligation, the two brothers recorded \"Louisiana Man\", an autobiographical song that Doug had written while in the Army. The song not only sold millions of copies but over the years has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music. The song was eventually covered by more than 800 artists.\n\nThere were three albums released by the duo on Hickory Records, only one being released before they split up. The first was \"Rusty and Doug Sing Louisiana Man\" (LPM 103) in 1961. \"Kershaw (Genus Cambarus)\" (LPS 163) was released in 1972 and was a double LP. \"Louisiana Man\" (HR 4506) was the final Hickory album, released in 1974. By 1964, the brothers had elected to go their separate ways. It took another three years before Kershaw signed a songwriters' contract with BMI, in 1967.\n\nIn June 1969, Kershaw made his first network television appearance on the debut of the \"Johnny Cash Show\". He capped the year with a week-long engagement at the New York City's Fillmore East as opening act for Eric Clapton's Derek and the Dominos. While it seemed to many rock and pop fans that Kershaw had appeared out of nowhere, he had already sold more than 18 million copies of the records he had made in the early '60s with his brother, Rusty. \"Louisiana Man\" had been a Top 10 country hit in 1961 and its follow-up, \"Diggy Liggy Lo\", had done almost as well. His performance in front of a national audience led to Warner Bros. Records signing him to a long-term contract. In July 1969, he performed at the Newport folk festival with peers Joni Mitchell, Arlo Guthrie, Ramblin Jack Elliott, Big Mama Thornton, and Mimi Fariña, among others. Newcomers that year were Don McLean, James Taylor, and Jerry Jeff Walker. In November 1969, \"Louisiana Man\" was broadcast back to earth by the crew of the Apollo 12 moon mission. Beyond the southern venues, Kershaw became widely known in mainstream America as he played at major urban concert halls.\n\nIn 1970, Kershaw contributed a violin part to Arlo Guthrie's record single Alice's Rock and Roll Restaurant.\n\nIn 1971, Kershaw had a musical cameo in the Western film \"Zachariah\", starring Don Johnson and John Rubinstein.\n\nIn 1972, Kershaw played electric fiddle in Grand Funk's \"Flight of the Phoenix\" off their LP Phoenix. Capitol SMAS 11099\n\nDespite the success of his solo career, Kershaw was plagued by depression and sorrow. His father had committed suicide when he was only seven. Marrying his wife, Pam, at the Houston Astrodome on June 21, 1975, Kershaw began raising his own family that included five sons – Douglas, Victor, Zachary, Tyler, and Elijah; and two grandsons and a granddaughter. His son, Tyler, plays drums in his band as well as manages his shows. \n\nKershaw rebounded with his biggest selling hit, \"Hello Woman\", which reached the country music Top 40. By 1984, Kershaw's battle with drug and alcohol abuse came to a close and his previously erratic behavior changed for the better.\n\nIn 1988, he recorded a duet, \"Cajun Baby\", with Hank Williams, Jr., that became a Top 50 country hit. Kershaw released a French-language album, \"Two Step Fever\", in 1999, and Michael Doucet of Beausoleil is featured on the duet \"Fievre De Deux Etapes\". \"Hot Diggity Doug\" was released in mid-2000 and \"Still Cajun After All These Years\" followed in early 2001. His brother Rusty died on October 23, 2001.\n\nKershaw formerly owned and operated The Bayou House, a restaurant in Lucerne, Colorado, but parted ways with his partners in 2007 due to his displeasure with management and ambiance.\n\nIn 2009, Doug was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.\n\nDoug's third cousin is country music star Sammy Kershaw.\n\n"}
{"id": "363878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363878", "title": "Duce", "text": "Duce\n\nDuce (, \"leader\") is an Italian title, derived from the Latin word \"dux\", and cognate with \"duke\". National Fascist Party leader Benito Mussolini was identified by Fascists as \"Il Duce\" (\"The Leader\") of the movement. In 1925 it became a reference to the dictatorial position of \"Sua Eccellenza Benito Mussolini, Capo del Governo, Duce del Fascismo e Fondatore dell'Impero\" (\"His Excellency Benito Mussolini, Head of Government, Leader of Fascism and Founder of the Empire\"). Mussolini held this title together with that of President of the Council of Ministers: this was the constitutional position which entitled him to rule Italy on behalf of the King of Italy. \"Founder of the Empire\" was added for the exclusive use by Mussolini in recognition of his founding of an official legal entity of the Italian Empire on behalf of the King in 1936 following Italy's victory in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The position was held by Mussolini until 1943, when he was removed from office by the King and the position of \"Duce\" was dismantled, while Marshal The 1st Duke of Addis Abeba was appointed \"Presidente del Consiglio\".\n\nThis position was the model which other fascist leaders adopted, such as the position of \"Führer\" by Adolf Hitler. In September 1943, Mussolini styled himself as the \"Duce of the Italian Social Republic\" (), and held the position until the collapse of the Italian Social Republic and his death in April 1945.\n\nThe title was used outside its traditional noble sense in some of the publications praising Garibaldi during the Unification of Italy in 1860, though not taken up officially by Garibaldi himself.\n\n'Duce Supremo' (\"Supreme Leader\") was more formally used by Victor Emmanuel III in 1915, during World War I, referring to his role as the commander in chief of the armed forces. The term was also used by Gabriele d'Annunzio as dictator of the self-proclaimed Italian Regency of Carnaro in 1920, and most significantly by the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The painting 'Il Duce' by Gerardo Dottori represents Mussolini. Because the title 'Il Duce' has become associated with Fascism, it is no longer in common use other than in reference to him. Because of modern anti-fascist sentiment, Italian speakers in general now use other words for leader, mainly including the English loanword. However, the term \"duce\" survives as an antonomasia for Benito Mussolini.\n\nMussolini intended that the Grand Council of Fascism would choose a successor from a list of three men chosen by him, and submit the name for approval by the king. As of 1940 he may have been preparing his son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano for the role.\n\n"}

He was called by Ralph Raico \"the last of the Old Right greats.\"\n\nBorn Fishel Chodorowsky on the Lower West Side of New York City on February 15, 1887, he was the eleventh child of Russian Jewish immigrants. He graduated from Columbia University in 1907, then worked at a number of jobs around the country. Working in Chicago (1912–17), he read Henry George's \"Progress and Poverty.\" Chodorov wrote that he \"read the book several times, and each time I felt myself slipping into a cause.\" According to Chodorov:\nIn 1937, Chodorov became director of the Henry George School of Social Science in New York. There, he established (with Will Lissner) and edited a school paper, \"The Freeman\". It published articles by Albert Jay Nock (founder of an earlier journal also called \"The Freeman\"), as well as such leading figures of the day as John Dewey, George Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, Lincoln Steffens and Thorsten Veblen. Chodorov used the magazine to express his antiwar views:\nWith the coming of World War II, such views were no longer tolerated: Chodorov was ousted from the school in 1942. He wrote that \"it seemed to me then that the only thing for me to do was to blow my brains out, which I might have done if I had not had Albert Jay Nock by my side.\" Nock had weathered similar \"war fever\" during World War I when as editor of the antiwar journal \"The Nation\", he had seen that magazine banned from the US mails by the Woodrow Wilson administration.\n\nChodorov published articles in a variety of magazines, including H.L. Mencken's \"American Mercury\", the \"Saturday Evening Post\" and \"Scribner's\". In 1944, he launched a four-page monthly broadsheet called \"analysis\", described as \"an individualistic publication—the only one of its kind in America.\" Murray Rothbard called it \"one of the best, though undoubtedly the most neglected, of the 'little magazines' that has ever been published in the United States.\"\n\nAlong with Nock's works, Chodorov was influenced by Franz Oppenheimer's \"The State\": \"between the state and the individual there is always a tug-of-war,\" wrote Chodorov, \"whatever power one acquires must be to the detriment of the other.\"\n\nIn 1954, Chodorov again became editor of \"The Freeman\", in its new incarnation, revived under the auspices of Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). He contributed several articles over the years to its \"Essays in Liberty\" series, beginning with Volume 1 in 1952. He engaged with William F. Buckley and Willi Schlamm on the question of whether individualists should support interventionism to aid people resisting communist aggression. Chodorov continued to advocate nonintervention, but as the Cold War continued, he lost influence: the American conservative movement came to be a bastion of interventionist foreign policy in combating Soviet expansionism.\n\nIn 1953, Chodorov founded the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists (ISI), with Buckley as president, becoming the first national conservative student organization, reaching 50,000 members by the end of the century. In later years, ISI became extremely influential as a clearinghouse of conservative publications and as a locus of the conservative intellectual movement in America. It later evolved into the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.\n\nChodorov was a major influence on many of those who would go on to lead the libertarian and conservative movements, including Buckley, M. Stanton Evans, Murray Rothbard, Edmund A. Opitz, and James J. Martin. Rothbard, an economist, wrote:\nA secular Jew, Chodorov gained a greater appreciation for religious thought in later years. He was an avid fan of westerns.\n\nIn the North American Confederacy alternate history series by L. Neil Smith, in which the United States becomes a libertarian state after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, Frank Chodorov was chosen by the Continental Congress to be H. L. Mencken's successor after his assassination in a duel in 1933. He served as the 20th President of the North American Confederacy from 1933 to 1940. He was succeeded by Rose Wilder Lane, who served as the 21st president from 1940 to 1952.\n\n"}

{"id": "34902552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34902552", "title": "Ioan C. Filitti", "text": "Ioan C. Filitti\n\nIoan Constantin Filitti (, first name also Ion; Francized \"Jean C. Filitti\"; May 8, 1879 – September 21, 1945) was a Romanian historian, diplomat and conservative theorist, best remembered for his contribution to social history, legal history, genealogy and heraldry. A member of the Conservative Party and an assistant of its senior leader Titu Maiorescu, he had aristocratic (boyar) origins and an elitist perspective. Among his diverse contributions, several focus on 19th-century modernization under the \"Regulamentul Organic\" regime, during which Romania was ruled upon by the Russian Empire. As a historian, Filitti is noted for his perfectionism, and for constantly revising his own works.\n\nI. C. Filitti had an auspicious debut in diplomacy and politics, but his career was mired in controversy. A \"Germanophile\" by the start of World War I, he secretly opposed the pact between Romania and the Entente Powers, and opted to stay behind in German-occupied territory. He fell into disgrace for serving the collaborationist Lupu Kostaki as Prefect and head of the National Theater, although he eventually managed to overturn his death sentence for treason. Filitti became a recluse, focusing on his scholarship and press polemics, but was allowed to serve on the Legislative Council after 1926.\n\nIn his political tracts, written well after the Conservative Party's demise, I. C. Filitti preserves the orthodox conservative principles of Maiorescu. His attachment to boyar tradition was expanded into a critique of centralized government, etatism and Romanian liberalism. Toward the end of his life, he supported the dictatorial regime known as National Renaissance Front.\n\nThrough his paternal family, Filitti descended from historical figures whose careers were intertwined with the history of Wallachia, the Romanian subregion and former autonomous state. It originated with ethnic Greek migrants from the Epirus—where the Filitti family was known to be residing in the 17th century. The main settlers were male monks, whose presence was attested in Buzău County around 1786: rising through the ranks of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Dositei Filitti served as Wallachian Metropolitan Bishop, assigning nephew Constandie to preside over the Diocese of Buzău. Although his Epirote father was a noted Russophile, the Metropolitan regarded himself as a liberal-minded Wallachian patriot: he founded the local school of divinity, provided scholarships to young Wallachians, and sponsored the growing printing industry. In tandem, he spoke out against the practice of slavery, protecting Romani women from their Wallachian masters and donating money for the release of \"devșirme\" victims. During times of turmoil, when Wallachia effectively became a dominion of the Russian Empire, Dositei was swiftly deposed on Russian orders.\n\nThe historian claimed lineage from the non-monastic branch of the Filitti clan. A Silvestru Filitti, active ca. 1810, was among the first private practitioners in Wallachia. Fully Romanianized, 20th-century Filittis were still members of Romania's privileged class. A native of Bucharest, Ioan C. was the son of Colonel Constantin Filitti, a former Ordinance Officer of the Romanian \"Domnitori\". By then, the family owned a country estate, at Alexeni, Ialomița County. The Filittis preserved strong connections with the Ialomița region, where Colonel Filitti had twice served as Prefect. Ioan inherited from him a deep dislike and mistrust toward the dominant National Liberal Party (PNL), sentiments which carried him into Conservative politics: Constantin regarded himself as a political victim of the PNL establishment, and in particular of the Brătianu family. Colonel Filitti had another son, Alexandru—better known under the moniker \"Filitti-Robănești\".\nThe mother, Elena, was born into the Ghica family. Her father, Mihail Ghica, was a staff officer of the Royal Army, who had been married for a while to writer Elena Văcărescu. Thorough his mother's other relatives, Ioan also descended from the eponymous boyar line of Slatina (the Slătineanus).\n\nI. C. Filitti studied at Saint Sava National College, where he was colleagues with future politician (and adversary) Ion G. Duca. He was an eminent student, who earned top distinctions annually, and moved on to study at the \"École Libre des Sciences Politiques\" in Paris. His first ever published work as a historian was a French-language tome, \"Le Rôle diplomatique des phanariotes de 1700 à 1821\" (\"The Diplomatic Role of Phanariotes from 1700 to 1821\"). Signed \"Jean C. Filitti\", it was probably his \"Licence ès Lettres\", and, although receiving good reviews, was never listed by its author in his official résumés. He became a Doctor of Law in 1904, when he published the first draft of his study about \"Regulamentul Organic\" as the first ever Romanian constitution.\n\nYoung Filitti made a remarkably early entry into the diplomatic corps, and stayed on with the Romanian Legation in France. In this capacity, he purposefully embarrassed PNL Foreign Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu by not sending in all Legation employees to receive him during an official visit. During his return trips to Romania, Filitti was focusing on researching his own family archives, and, in 1910, published the volume \"Așezământul cultural al mitropolitului Dosit[h]ei Filitti, de la înființare până azi\" (\"Metropolitan Dosit[h]ei Filitti's Cultural Foundation, from Its Establishment to the Present Day\"). In researching this work, Filitti sought input from the genealogical school in Greece and Macedonia, and from Romanian diplomats working in Istanbul. In a show of perfectionism, Filitti constantly revised the work as new data surfaced, and, in 1936, declared the 1910 edition to be entirely unusable.\n\nFilitti was soon drawn into the Conservative establishment, by politics and family connections. His wife Alexandrina (\"Sanda\"), descending from another branch of the Ghica clan, was a distant relative of two Conservative potentates and doyens of the Cantacuzino political family: Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino-Nababul, who was twice the Prime Minister of Romania, and newspaper magnate Grigore Gh. Cantacuzino. She brought in considerable wealth. Filitti was by then also in contact with \"Junimea\", an inner-Conservative club dedicated to cultural criticism, presided upon by the aged literary patron Titu Maiorescu. As noted in 2008 by political scientist Ioan Stanomir, the young diplomat was \"an orthodox \"Junimist\" who survived the end of his world.\" Like other historiographers and doctrinaires raised by \"Junimea\", Filitti the scholar firmly believed in the preservation of boyar \"demesnes\" and, as political scientist Victor Rizescu suggests, took part in the century-long debate opposing elitist historians to the advocates of natural law.\n\nFilitti's biographer and posthumous daughter-in-law, Georgeta Penelea-Filitti, also writes that, even in the 1910s, he had become a Conservative apologist, who felt compelled to justify the party line in a \"trenchant and unresponsive\" manner. Like senior \"Junimists\" Maiorescu and Petre P. Carp, Filitti reserved contempt for Take Ionescu, the rising star of Romanian conservatism, whom he depicted as a manipulator with no actual convictions.\n\nFilitti's first important postings were received from the Conservative cabinet of P. P. Carp, wherein Titu Maiorescu held the Foreign Affairs portfolio. After 1910, Maiorescu appointed Filitti head of the Ministry's Political Section in Bucharest, and then granted him supervision of the Consular and Litigation sections. Filitti was also sent on regular missions to France, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Serbia and Italy. The missions allowed Filitti to expand his activity as a historiographer and archivist. The main stimulus of this activity was, according to Filitti's son Manole, a sense of filial duty: \"since destiny wished for his parents to have such assets as would allow him to study in Paris for a couple of years, [my father] felt compelled to repay them by publishing works which would live up to that degree of education.\" According to historian Lucian Boia, although \"non-academic\", Filitti's work has earned deserved praise from within the scholarly community. Georgeta Penelea-Filitti argues that I. C. Filitti's work, indicative of his personality, covers an impressively \"large horizon.\"\n\nOn May 8, 1913, shortly before the Second Balkan War, Filitti began keeping a diary, which records the political intrigues of his age, and offers insight into Conservative affairs. One of the first events recorded there is the August 1913 Peace Conference of Bucharest. Filitti was the official Secretary during the proceedings. In this context, he also helped Titu Maiorescu with drafting \"Cartea Verde\" (\"The Green Book\"), that is the official justification of Romanian foreign policy. Decades later, he recalled that the congress had been a magnificent affair, noting especially the triumphant arrival of King Carol I, that \"old Nestor of European monarchs\". The Conference, he recalled, \"was the swan song of the old Conservative Party.\"\n\nHis services during the Conference earned him public praise from Maiorescu, and Filitti, who feared for his prospects, was kept on at the Ministry even after the National Liberal Emanuel Porumbaru became Minister in January 1914. In tandem with his diplomatic endeavors, he spent time researching at the Vatican Library in Rome. As noted by Manole Filitti, Ioan C. received \"special recommendations\", which allowed him entry into the less accessible archives of the Holy See. Such study trips resulted in a two-volume anthology of historical sources, \"Din arhivele Vaticanului\" (\"From the Vatican Archives\", 1913 and 1914).\n\nWorld War I was a turning point in Filitti's diplomatic career. Like many of his fellow Conservatives, and against the lobby which dominated the PNL, he believed in tying Romania to the Central Powers, especially to the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. The Entente Powers alternative, he argued, was bankrupt, because Romania would find herself manipulated by a hostile Russian Empire. His core idea, paraphrased by Georgeta Filitti, was that: \"Any entente, any attempt to collaborate, any concession made to [Russia] would sooner or later turn against us.\" The diplomat witnessed with alarm that public opinion was against him, either because of seductive Francophilia, or because a war on Austria-Hungary could bring Romania Transylvania region and other irredenta: \"The Russian gold has bought off the press and many private persons. Others are guided by sentimentality\". In restaurants such as Casa Capșa, \"Franco-hysteria and Russo-Frenchitude [have reached] a peak\", and \"people of no significance\" were even proposing to assassinate the Germanophile King Carol. In this context, he believed, Transylvania could only stand to lose its character if ever governed from Bucharest.\n\nAt around that time, Filitti issued at his expense the Germanophile brochure \"Cu Tripla Alianță\" (\"With the Triple Alliance\"). He prudently signed it with the fake initials \"F. K.\" In it, Filitti spoke out at length about containing Pan-Slavism, more important a priority than \"the nation's other aspirations\" (in Transylvania): \"The best thing one may wish upon Romania is that the Muscovite Empire be evicted as far away as possible from the heart of Europe.\" The pamphlet was also noted for its unfulfilled prophecy that Italy would also join the war as a German ally, and for arguing that, either way, Austria-Hungary was set to collapse after the war. The text's reception, he noted, was disastrous: no reviews were printed, almost no bookstores would sell it, and the few who looked over it attributed it to an agent of influence or to some \"paid-off Jew\". In \"Cu Tripla Alianță\" and in his diary, the diplomat continued to complain that the Francophile mood was irrational, since France and the Entente as a whole only \"love [Romanians] when they need us\", which was \"only natural\". In the same vein, his diary documents earlier instances where (he argued) France had gambled with Romania's independence.\n\nIn his more public existence, I. C. Filitti was still regarded with sympathy by the entire political and cultural establishment. In 1915, he was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. The institution also granted him its prestigious Năsturel Herescu Award. This was in recognition of his groundbreaking monograph on modernization under the \"Regulamentul\" regime: \"Domniile române sub Regulamentul Organic\" (\"Romanian Reigns under \"Regulamentul Organic\"\"). It described in some detail the culture shock of the 1830s, when the Westernized elites reversed a process of Turkification, and noted the ambivalent policies of Russian governors. The book also speaks about the 1832 manhunt for, and forced sedentarization of, Wallachia's Romani people, both the fugitive slaves and the free nomads.\n\n\"Domniile române...\" was simultaneously published in Bucharest (by Editura Socec), Leipzig (Otto Harrassowitz) and Vienna (Carl Gerold). It was then reprinted by the official Editura Academiei press, under the supervision of historian Nicolae Iorga. The encounter was confrontational: Iorga decided to cut out entire passages where, he argued, the author had gone into too much detail. The intervention was unwittingly destructive, as part of the documents cited by Filitti, and only by him, have since been destroyed.\n\nIt was also in 1915 that Filitti contributed his views on the thorny issue of \"Capitulations\", contracts reputedly signed by two Danubian Principalities (Wallachia and Moldavia) when they first came under the Ottoman Empire's suzerainty. The author postulated that the Capitulations regulated the status of foreigners living in ancient Romania, exempting them from the consequences of common law, and creating major legal problems after 1800. His research produced the article \"România față de capitulațiile Turciei\" (\"Romania in Relation to the Turkish Capitulations\"), taken up by the Academy's official yearbook. It saw print at the same time as his new collection of documents, sampling the archives of French Ambassadors to the Porte: \"Lettres et extraits concernant les relations des principautés roumaines avec la France, 1728-1810\" (\"Letters and Excerpts on the Relations between the Romanian Principalities and France\").\n\nI. C. Filitti was not in a celebratory mood as the National Liberals publicized their August 1916 Treaty, when Romania became part of the Entente. His diaries record not only his general frustration, but also his belief that the decades of PNL rule had left the military ill-prepared, and claims about generalized embezzlement within the Army. He was soon after drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, as officer of the Second Field Army, and stationed in Bucharest. When the German-led counteroffensive forced the army on the retreat, resulting in the Central Powers' occupation of southern Romania, Filitti took his most controversial decision. In circumstances that are largely unknown, he opted to stay behind in occupied territory, and greeted the enemy. According to Boia, Filitti received two contradictory orders: one to follow the Imperial Russian Army as liaison officer, the other to stay behind in Bucharest; he conveniently opted to follow the latter.\n\nThe Filitti family had by then divided its loyalties: judge Ioan D. Filitti, formerly a PNL politico, followed the Germanophile line; instead, Ioan C.'s own brother Alexandru entered history when he led a cavalry charge on a German machine gun turret, located outside of Balș.\n\nAt the time, Lupu Kostaki was organizing left-behind Conservatives and forming a provisional administration, answering to the German command. Filitti served Kostaki as Head of the National Theater Bucharest. Under his management, the Theater took on some 67 new productions of Romanian plays. The Germans also assigned him to an administrative position, making him the Prefect of Ialomița County. However, Filitti himself was troubled by his association with the puppet regime. According to Georgeta Filitti, the diary he kept shows \"the efforts to interpose himself between the foreign military authorities and his own administrators, to alleviate the unbearable regime of requisitions, the abuse and Prussian arrogance, [efforts which] were, for the most part, ineffectual.\" Like other Germanophiles, Filitti justified himself as a protector of Romanian interests during times of chaos, and was discouraged to find out that the German regime regarded him as a servant. He had similar trouble getting along with some of his Romanian colleagues, in particular Virgil Arion, the phantom Minister of Education (whom he described as nepotistic, aloof, and especially \"lazy\").\n\nBoth of his assignments failed to satisfy him: he was, according to Boia, a \"strange\" choice for the Theater leadership, and gave up on this office in April 1917; Filitti himself viewed his Prefect's job as inane, and repeatedly presented his resignation (only accepted in February 1918). His departure from the Theater was in fact hastened by the Germans, who took over the location for their own purposes. Filitti informed the troupe members that they had to pay rent, and they moved out in protest. While in Ialomița, Filitti combined his administrative missions (retold as short notes in his diaries) with historical research, and tapped into a documentary fund at Alexeni. Although only a junior member of the administrative staff, Filitti aimed for a position at the core of government, and demanded from Kostaki a post better suited to his intelligence, \"in Bucharest\". He noted that the death of Maiorescu in June 1917 had stripped him of political support inside the Conservative Party, and had derailed his steady advancement.\n\nMeanwhile, the legitimate government had relocated to Iași, in besieged Moldavia. Late in 1916, it court-martialled Filitti \"in absentia\", and sentenced him to death for the crime of high treason. By January 1918, the collapse of Russian forces on the Eastern Front led the Iași administration into negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers. Germanophile Alexandru Marghiloman took over as Premier, in what seemed to spell a moral victory for the pro-German camp. However, Filitti was drawing closer to the more disgruntled Germanophiles, led by P. P. Carp, who wanted to sign peace on their own terms: \"I ask Carp, should he leave to negotiate for Romania, to take me with him. He says that he'll take along his son. I note that one does not exclude the other. He agrees\" (January 12, 1918). Filitti was also upset that Marghiloman himself had not yet offered him a high diplomatic post during negotiations over the Buftea-Bucharest Peace Treaty, and noted that the Ententist King, Ferdinand I, \"made it hard\" for him to be accepted back into the diplomatic corps. As noted by Georgeta Filitti, Ferdinand vetoed successive proposals to rehire him as public servant.\n\nIn June 1918, I. C. Filitti handed himself in to the authorities in Moldavia, and, upon retrial, was acquitted of treason. In addition to presenting evidence of his efforts to curb German excesses, he enlisted the testimony of Ialomița citizens, who vouched for him. However, Boia concludes, the retrial itself was a sham: \"A rehabilitation as politicized in the new context as had been his sentencing at the end of 1916.\"\n\nUpon the end of 1918, when the Central Powers succumbed on the Western Front, the pro-Entente forces regained power. I. C. Filitti faced the political repercussions: blocked out of the Foreign Ministry and diplomatic corps, he had to reinvent himself as a full-time historian, publicist and essayist. He largely immersed himself in his decades-long work, in effect a multilevel historical narrative covering the history of the Danubian Principalities, from the foundation of Wallachia (14th century) to the emergence of United Romania (1859). Much of his interest, marked by what Georgeta Filitti calls \"excessive accuracy\", was in reviewing the intricate boyar genealogies. He substantiated the various inheritance claims, and, in addition, painstakingly retraced the borders of Wallachia's oldest \"demesnes\". During his retrial, facing the possibility of execution, Filitti also turned his attention to the philosophy of history, reading profusely from Ernest Renan and Hippolyte Taine.\n\nAccording to Filitti, the war spelled out the end of Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the \"nouveaux riches\" and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself collapsed into obscurity, he remained largely cut off from the outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.\n\nFilitti lived secluded in a townhouse on Oltarului Street, in the Bucharest quarter of Moșilor. He repeatedly complained about street noises, confiscated the footballs of neighborhood children, and eventually received (from Romanian Police chief Gavrilă Marinescu) a permanent guard to protect him from distractions. Filitti had few visiting friends, among them Alexandru Filitti-Robănești, teacher Alexandru Pisoschi, historians Emanoil Hagi-Moscu and G. D. Florescu. He was however in constant correspondence with other scholars who shared his passions, including Greek jurist Panagiotis Zepos, His Majesty's Antiquarian G. T. Kirileanu, bibliophile Constantin Karadja, regional historian G. Poboran, academician-priest Nicolae M. Popescu and Hungarian archivist Endre (Andrei) Veress. In addition to the anti-Germanophile Nicolae Iorga, his rivals in academia included a new generation of leading historians, who were targets of his polemical articles: Gheorghe I. Brătianu, George Fotino, Constantin C. Giurescu and P. P. Panaitescu. The latter was however influenced by Filitti's ideas on the sources of landed property, and incorporated them into his own historical narrative.\n\nAn early product of Filitti's interest in genealogy was a 1919 book about his relatives, the Cantacuzinos: \"Arhiva Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino\" (\"The Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino Archive\"). It refers to the documents collected by Cantacuzino-Nababul, whom the book describes as: \"Good and kind, a self-effacing host, confident of the nation's faculties.\" The author tracked down Nababul's origins to Michael \"Șeytanoğlu\" Kantakouzenos, a Byzantine Greek in Ottoman service, active around 1580. The factual errors of this study caused Filitti great distress, to the point where he planned to entirely revise his version of the Cantacuzino family tree. The book is still considered a particularly relevant source on the obscure genealogies of some high-ranking Greek-Romanian families: Cara(g)iani, Filodor, Gheraki and Plagino.\n\nFilitti the politician returned in 1921 with an extended \"\" covering his wartime stances: \"\" (\"Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany Confront Romania\"). The same year, in May, Iași's \"Viața Românească\" review hosted his tract on administrative reform, whereby he criticized attempts to impose centralized government on post-war Greater Romania. He proposed three essential policies: decentralization, the depoliticization of public administration, and enhanced executive powers for the prefects. These prolonged P. P. Carp's ideas on local autonomy and, in addition, attempted to protect the existing local government of the newly united Transylvania, Bessarabia and Bukovina.\n\nHe still struggled with prejudice against Germanophiles: also in 1921, he tried to obtain the History Chair at the University of Iași, but lost once his old adversary Iorga intervened against him. Two years later, he was present at the funeral ceremony of Dimitrie Onciul, a fellow historian and \"Junimist\". Onciul, whose Germanophila had been the topic of a major scandal in 1919, was honored by Filitti with a funeral oration. It stated: \"All of us, we are what our known or unknown ancestors have accumulated in our beings; we are that which preceding generations have planted in us; we are the echo of our dead.\"\n\nIn the early 1920s, I. C. Filitti worked with the formerly \"Junimist\" tribune \"Convorbiri Literare\", which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently turned his attention to some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book \"Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc\" (\"Social Classes in the Romanian Past\"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their \"demesnes\".\n\nEventually, in 1926, King Ferdinand allowed Filitti to resume his political career, making him a member of the Romanian Legislative Council. An emanation of the 1923 Constitution, it comprised experts tasked with reviewing laws endorsed by Parliament, and whose exact role sparked a series of controversies. Filitti was among those who described the Council as a necessary branch of the legislature, rather than as an organ of the executive.\n\nAlso in 1926, Filitti was one of the authors of a legal history overview, \"Contribuții la istoria justiției penale în Principatele române\" (\"Contributions to the History of Penal Justice in the Romanian Principalities\"). By means of Iorga's academic journal \"Revista Istorică\", he also publicized his discovery of a 17th-century Romanian glossary, which emissaries of the Holy See used on their missions to the Danubian Principalities. He returned in 1927 with a work tracing the very history of the Legislative Council: \"Originea și menirea Consiliului Legislativ\" (\"The Origin and Purpose of the Legislative Council\").\n\nFilitti ended the 13th and final notebook of his diary on March 6, 1928. By 1929, he turned his attention to the history of medicine in Wallachia, publishing a study of medical practice between 1784 and 1828. The same year, he edited the critical edition of the 1829 boyar register (\"catagrafie\"), originally compiled by Russian authorities under \"Regulamentul\" provisions. It notably showed the division of aristocracy into three classes, with only 70 entries in the top, \"great boyars\", category. Filitti demonstrated that, at only 4.6 ‰ of the Wallachian population, Wallachian boyars formed one of the thinnest layers of European aristocrats proportional to the respective population.\n\nWhile still involved in the disputes over Legislative Council attributions, Filitti was a member, and later President, of the state's Heraldry and Genealogy Commission. The appointment again brought him into disagreement with the Romanian monarch, this time involving the heraldic symbols of Greater Romania. Filitti and Kirileanu suggested redesigned coats of arms of the Romanian counties, each bearing the Steel Crown, as a show of national unity; Ferdinand disagreed, and the counties were only allowed their simple escutcheons. He was turning his attention to the Slătineanu branch of his family, and completed a biographical study on Ion Slătineanu, governor of Brăila in the 1830s (hosted by the magazine \"Analele Brăilei\", 1/1929).\n\nSome of Filitti's biographical work was dedicated to the 16th-century Wallachian hero Michael the Brave. In 1931, he published an investigation of Michael's early career as titular Ban of Oltenia. A year later, he detailed Michael's introduction of serfdom in Wallachia: \"Despre \"legătura\" lui Mihai Viteazul\" (\"On 'Bondage' under Michael the Brave\"). Between these, the academic review \"Analele Economice și Statistice\", Vol. XIV, reissued the 1857 count of emancipated Romani slaves, annotated by Filitti. In 1932, returning to the history of Oltenian Bans, he gave an account on the Craiovești family history, taken up by \"Arhivele Olteniei\" journal. His ongoing research into social issues of the early 19th century produced another book, \"Frământări politice și sociale în Principatele române de la 1821 la 1828\" (\"Political and Social Turmoil in the Romanian Principalities from 1821 to 1828\", Cartea Românească, 1932). It has been described as a \"non-partisan analysis\" of the Wallachian uprising of 1821 and its reverberations, and features detail on the property dispute between local Orthodox monks and their Greek Orthodox competitors.\n\nBy 1928, I. C. Filitti's writing was moving from sheer historical research, as he was taking a stand in political theory. As noted by Ioan Stanomir, Filitti's evolution in this direction marks a final cycle in the history of classical, \"Burkean\", conservatism in Romania, which did not have a political aspect, but was complementary and contemporary with the views of his rival Nicolae Iorga. According to Stanomir, the objectivity professed by Filitti the historiographer was at odds with his ambition to rehabilitate \"Junimea\" and the Conservative cause, to prolong their relevancy into the 1930s. Some of his core ideas were updated versions of 19th-century \"Junimist\" concepts: the praise of moderation and organicity, the rejection of state capitalism and its \"pseudo-bourgeoisie\", and in particular the critique of generous land reforms. Directly influenced by the agrarian skepticism of Carp and Maiorescu, Filitti argued that the division of large estates into non-lucrative plots had only enhanced endemic problems, such as poverty or an unskilled workforce, and had prevented an organic growth toward good governance. Filitti's diary chides the political establishment of Greater Romania for not obtaining sufficient guarantees of territorial integrity—particularly so against Russia's successor, the Soviet Union—and for deprofessionalizing the diplomatic corps.\n\nFrom Maiorescu, Filitti borrowed the essential sociological concept of \"forms without content\", criticizing all modernization which did not take into account local realities, writing: \"After seven decades of bourgeois forms, without a bourgeoisie, with all that maelstrom of laws and regulations, which has grown to cover 20,000 pages [...], the tally shows that [...] the villages of all places have registered no profit, although [...] Romania is, at heart, nothing but one giant village.\" In his post-\"Junimist\" studies, Filitti angrily noted that the PNL regime had only increased the ranks of the bureaucracy (and implicitly enlarged their political machine), perpetuating etatism. He proposed measures to counter this trend by encouraging a \"rural bourgeoisie\", \"self-reliant\", determined to reemerge \"from the darkness and routine\" of country life, and, in time, capable of supporting a national industry.\n\nIn 1932, Filitti, who kept a vivid interest in Romanian Orthodox history, published \"Biserici și ctitori\" (\"Churches and \"Ktitors\"\"). He was preoccupied with similar thoughts when he decided to sponsor the rebuilding and refurbishing of two ancestral churches: the Dormition Church in Slatina, originally built by his Slătineanu relatives (whom he commemorated with a coat of arms, displayed over the church entrance); and the \"Sfântul Dumitru de Jurământ\" Metochion of Constandie Filitti (whom he had reburied on church premises).\n\nIt was in 1934 that I. C. Filitti registered one of his greatest successes, when he published a revised and extended version of his 1904 study: \"Principatele române de la 1828 la 1834. Ocupațiunea rusească și Regulamentul Organic\" (\"The Romanian Principalities from 1828 to 1834. The Russian Occupation and \"Regulamentul Organic\"\"). The study even earned him accolades from Iorga, who called it \"an extraordinarily rich work of pragmatic history\". The work mainly documents the emergence of a civic consciousness, called \"public spirit\" by Filitti, over the years when \"Regulamentul\" was in force, and speaks about how the Moldo-Wallachian Russophile class turned Russophobic as it became acquainted with Tsarist autocracy. \"Principatele române...\" includes additional data on the rift between the liberal youth, with its ideal of national liberation, and the peasantry, more determined to terminate the \"corvée\" system. He continued to publish on topical issues of legal history, documenting the antique Wallachian form of \"Weregild\" (\"plata capului\", \"head payment\"), and on historiography, with a \"Revista Istorică\" biography of Wallachian chronicler Radu Greceanu. His other book for that year was an extended political manifesto, \"Rătăcirile unei pseudo-burghezii și reforme ce nu se fac\" (\"The Aberrations of a Pseudo-bourgeoisie and Reforms Not Effected\").\n\nIn 1935, Filitti completed his \"Proprietatea solului în Principatele române până la 1864\" (\"Land Ownership in the Romanian Principalities to 1864\") and \"Contribuții la istoria diplomatică a României în secolul al XIX-lea\" (\"Contributions to the Diplomatic History of Romania in the 19th Century\"). In \"Vechea organizare fiscală a Principatelor Române până la Regulamentul Organic\" (\"On the Ancient Fiscal Order of the Romanian Principalities to \"Regulamentul Organic\"\"), he discussed the proliferation of state taxes over the centuries, and the measure to which the Orthodox clergy was exempted. A fourth book, on literary history, saw print with the title \"Cărți vechi privitoare la români\" (\"Old Books Relating to the Romanians\"). Also in 1935, he released a selection of his memoirs, as \"Câteva amintiri\" (\"Some Recollections\"), and set in print his conferences for the state Radio Company: \"Dezvoltarea politică a României moderne\" (\"The Political Development of Modern Romania\"). Building on his previous research in \"Arhiva Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino\", Filitti also contributed an article about the Romanian origins of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue (\"Adevărul\" daily, September 29, 1935) and edited for print the letters of Oltenian engineer Petrache Poenaru (\"Arhivele Olteniei\", 74-76/1934).\n\nHis other contribution for 1935 was a collection of texts on political history, called \"Pagini din istoria României moderne\" (\"Pages from the History of Modern Romania\"). The volume criticized the PNL's historical narrative, Romania's answer to Whiggishness, and noted that, from the beginning, the Conservatives were closer to the models of classical liberalism than their revolutionist opponents. Published with the \"Lupta\" Graphic Arts Institute in 1936, Filitti's new essay revisited the birth and evolution of conservatism in the Danubian Principalities and then Romania: \"Conservatori și junimiști în viața politică românească\" (\"Conservatives and \"Junimists\" in Romanian Political Life\"). The work postulated that local conservatism had in fact originated within the first phase of Romanian liberalism, grouping opponents of the \"extremist\", \"utopian\", \"exulted\" force which became the National Liberal elite. He argued that, since the National Liberals had become the establishment and did away with their republican agenda, the Conservatives, \"in reality moderate liberals\", came to be falsely depicted as \"reactionaries\". His retrospective portrait of \"Junimea\" was, according to Stanomir, particularly \"melancholy\", his own \"Junimism\" \"never abjured\".\n\nIn 1936, I. C. Filitti wrote an article defining the scope and history of the Legislative Council. It was featured in the anniversary collection of articles published by Council President Ioan Ionescu-Dolj. His revised work on the Cantacuzinos, published in Bucharest as \"Notice sur les Cantacuzène du XIe au XVIIe siècles\" (\"Note on the Cantacuzinos from the 11th to the 14th Century\"), traced the family links between Cantacuzino-Nababul and 14th-century Byzantine Emperor John VI, whom Filitti identified as a usurper. Also then, he republished a political pamphlet by the 18th-century poet Alecu Văcărescu, with the journal \"Preocupări Literare\".\n\nFilitti was preparing his retirement from public life, and designated his only son Manole as a curator of the Filitti Archive. Filitti Jr was a lawyer, financier and amateur rugby footballer, who would later serve as manager of the Phoenix Oil Factory. Married to actress Mimi Enăceanu, he was for long based in Iași, sharing a villa with the poet Mihail Codreanu. It was there that Ioan C.'s grandson Ion was born in 1936. His baptism was a public affair involving some of the established aristocratic houses, and one of the last functions ever attended by Filitti Sr (who met and befriended Codreanu on the occasion).\n\nThe National Renaissance Front dictatorship, with King Carol II at its helm, put an end to democratic rule in Greater Romania. Under these circumstances, I. C. Filitti was recovered by the official school of historians. From 1938, sociologist Dimitrie Gusti employed Filitti as an external contributor to the standard Romanian dictionary, \"Enciclopedia României\". His \"fundamental\" contribution was, according to Stanomir, the \"Legislative Council\" entry, included in Volume I. Together with I. C. Vântu, Filitti also wrote the section on the administrative reform, whereby Carol had replaced the counties with larger \"ținuturi\". This entry justified Carol's ideas on territorial division, describing the new regions as organic, \"moral, cultural, economic and financial\" units. The two authors offered praise to the supposedly increased representative powers of communes, and to the laws protecting private property within urban domains. As noted by Georgeta Filitti, I. C. Filitti was again dissatisfied with the finished product: \"The [\"Enciclopedia\"] copy he left comprises numerous rectifications to his own entries and observations made on those of other authors, which would be welcomed for any future reediting.\" Filitti's other contribution for 1938 is an eponymous volume about the 1821 Wallachian revolutionist Tudor Vladimirescu, with the subtitle: \"Rostul răscoalei lui\" (\"The Purpose of His Revolt\").\n\nFrom May 1938, Filitti was also General Administrative Inspector of the kingdom. The outbreak of World War II again pushed him away from public life. Romania was an Axis country, and, as such, Bucharest endured heavy bombardments by the United States Air Force. The air attack of April 4, 1944, effectively destroyed the Filitti residence, its art collection (including Murano glassware) and scores of unedited documents. The historian survived, but, according to Georgeta Filitti, the incident \"hastened his death\".\n\nI. C. Filitti died in September 1945, almost a year after King Michael's Coup broke with the Axis. By his own account, he had published 82 volumes, 267 topical articles, and completed some 700 family trees. Many of these texts were circular of \"rectifications\" to previous editions, addressed to the community of scientists at large.\n\nFilitti's death occurred shortly before a Romanian communist regime came into existence. He was survived by his wife and son. An aristocrats by blood and conservatives by conviction, Ioan C.'s descendants and relatives suffered heavily as a result of the new policies: the outspoken anti-communist Filitti-Robănești became a political prisoner, as did his cousin Puiu Filitti, who had been the King's Adjutant. Alexandrina Filitti was stripped of virtually all her land during the land reform and nationalization, but still forced to meet agricultural quotas imposed by the government; when she failed to do so, Manole Filitti took it upon himself to face the consequences, and spent some three years in communist jails.\n\nUpon release, Manole and part of the Filitti clan moved into a single Bucharest home, located near the Darvari Skete. Reintegrated as a clerk for nationalized enterprises, he remarried, in 1985, to historian Georgeta Penelea. Of Croat and Istro-Romanian ancestry, she is related to prestigious woman reporter Mihaela Catargi. Manole's son Ion had a career in engineering, but could not advance professionally due to his aristocratic lineage. He emigrated to West Germany, where a branch of the Filittis still resides.\n\nAlthough officially censored, Filitti's work was not entirely inaccessible. As indicated by Victor Rizescu, under orthodox Marxism-Leninism, the idea of boyar precedence in the early Danubian Principalities was not discarded, but rather integrated within a \"modes of production\" theory. Some of Filitti's books were reprinted in the 1980s, when national communism allowed selective exposure to Romania's conservative schools of thought. As noted by historian Ovidiu Pecican, the regime was trying to encourage \"autarkic xenophobia\", preventing intellectuals from receiving Western ideas, but in exchange allowing them a selective recovery of old ideas. In 1985, \"Proprietatea solului...\", \"Frământări politice și sociale...\" and \"România față de capitulațiile Turciei\" were reissued in critical editions. On the academic side, the main contributor to this particular recovery project was Georgeta Penelea-Filitti, also distinguished as the editor of books by Iorga, Mihail Kogălniceanu, and other intellectual figures.\n\nThe Romanian Revolution of 1989 resulted in more consideration being granted to I. C. Filitti, as both researcher and polemicist. The Filitti Archive, preserved by Manole Filitti, was divided into separate funds, and divided between several institutions: the Romanian Academy Library, the National Archives, the Cotroceni Palace collection, and the Ialomița County Museum. Selections from the historian's diaries were published by Georgeta Filitti as fascicles in the academic review \"Revista Istorică\", during the early 1990s. Beginning 2008, she published the diary in book form, with the Ialomița Museum press and Cetatea de Scaun company of Târgoviște.\n\nRomania's academic community was thus prompted to reassess the overall value of Ioan C. Filitti's work. The popular history review \"Magazin Istoric\" grants an I. C. Filitti Award as one of its four annual distinctions for exceptional research and writing. In 2009, Editura Compania company published historian Dan Berindei's book of scholarly biographies, which notably includes a chapter on Filitti. According to Boia, Berindei bracketed out Filitti's entire career in occupied Romania, while expressing a vague regret that Filitti never reached his full potential in diplomacy. Boia asks rhetorically: \"the historian knows [the reason for this], shouldn't the reader also find it out?\" According to political scientist Cristian Cercel, Ioan Stanomir takes credit for having helped recover Filitti's contributions as conservative theorist, which had been \"all too soon forgotten.\" In his 2004 book \"Conștiința conservatoare\" (\"The Conservative Consciousness\"), Stanomir places Filitti alongside Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Alexandru Duțu and Virgil Nemoianu, as one of the intellectuals who preserved a place for \"Junimist\" conservatism into the latter 20th century and beyond.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "663342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=663342", "title": "Josip Jelačić", "text": "Josip Jelačić\n\nCount Josip Jelačić von Bužim (16 October 180120 May 1859; also spelled \"Jellachich\", \"Jellačić\" or ; in Croatian: \"Josip grof Jelačić Bužimski\") was the Ban of Croatia between 23 March 1848 and 19 May 1859. He was a member of the House of Jelačić and a noted army general, remembered for his military campaigns during the Revolutions of 1848 and for his abolition of serfdom in Croatia.\n\nThe son of Croatian Baron Franjo Jelačić Bužimski (or in other documents, ) (1746–1810), a lieutenant Field Marshal, and Austrian mother Anna Portner von Höflein, Jelačić was born in the town of Petrovaradin, at the time part of the Slavonian Military Frontier of the Habsburg Empire (today part of Vojvodina, Serbia). He was educated in Vienna at the Theresian Military Academy, where he received a versatile education, showing particular interest in history and foreign languages. He entrained in the Austrian army on 11 March 1819 with the rank of lieutenant Vinko Freiherr von Knežević Regiment, named for his uncle. He was fluent in all South-Slavic languages, as well as German, Italian, and French.\n\nOn 1 May 1825 he was promoted to first lieutenant, and to captain by 1 September 1830 in Karlovac, Croatia.\n\nOn 17 October 1835, he led a military campaign against Bosnian Ottoman troops in Velika Kladuša for which he received a medal. He was promoted to major on 20 February 1837 in the Freiherr von Gollner regiment, and on the first of May in 1841 to lieutenant colonel in the 1st Croatian Frontier Guard Regiment in Glina, Croatia, then promoted to colonel on October 18.\n\nOn 22 March, Jelačić was promoted to major-general, and simultaneously the Sabor (the National Assembly of Croatia) elected him as Ban of Croatia. The Sabor also declared that the first elections or representatives to the assembly would be held in May 1848.\n\nJelačić was promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal on 7 April 1848, becoming the commander of all Habsburg troops in Croatia.\n\nIn 1850 he married , daughter of Count Georg Stockau, in Napajedla.\n\nJelačić supported independence for Croatia from the Austrian throne. However, in pursuit of this goal Jelačić sought to support this goal by ingratiating himself with the Austrian throne by actively supporting Austrian interests in putting down revolutionary movements in northern Italy in 1848 and in actively opposing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848–1849. Consequently, Jelačić's, reputation differs in Austria where he was looked upon as a rebel seeking to break up the Austrian Empire, Croatia where he is a national hero, and Hungary where he looked up as a traitor to the Hungarian Revolution for independence from Austrian throne.\n\nHe traveled to Vienna to take oaths to become counsel of Austrian Emperor, Ferdinand I of Austria, but refused to take the oath as Ban of Croatia, because it was a Hungarian dependent territory. The relations between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Austrian Empire deteriorated after the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution on 15 March 1848. But he later took the oath as Ban of Croatia on 5 June 1848. Because of the absence of Bishop Juraj Haulik, he took the oath before the Orthodox Patriarch Josif Rajačić.\n\nJelačić, now Ban, supported the Croatian aim to maintain autonomy from the Kingdom of Hungary. Jelačić proceeded to sever all official ties of Croatia from Hungary. The Austrian Imperial Court initially opposed this act as one of disobedience and separatism, declaring him to be a rebel and the Sabor to be illegitimate. But the court soon realized Jelačić and his Croatian army were a support against the newly formed Batthyány Government. Traveling back to Zagreb in April, Jelačić refused to cede to this new government, refused any cooperation, and called for elections to the Sabor on 25 March 1848.\n\nThe Sabor – now acting as the National Assembly – declared the following demands to the Habsburg emperor:\n\n\nMany of his points about civil rights were part of the Hungarian twelve points, and were already enacted by the Batthyány Government.\n\nThe Sabor strongly opposed the \"massive nationalist Magyarization politics of the Kingdom of Hungary from the Carpathians to Adria, which the newly formed government represents, especially Lajos Kossuth.\"\n\nOn 8 April Jelačić took his banal oath and was appointed a field-marshal-lieutenant and made commander of the Military Frontier. On 19 April 1848 Jelačić proclaimed the union of Croatian provinces, and the separation from the Kingdom of Hungary. At the same time, he proclaimed unconditional loyalty to the Habsburg monarchy. The Croatian Constitution of 24 April 1848 declared \"languages of all ethnicities should be inviolable\".\n\nOn serfdom, it was apparent that changing the status of the Croatian peasantry would have to wait until the end of the revolution. Jelačić kept up the institution of the Military Frontier so he could draft more soldiers. The people in the region protested to this, but Ban Jelačić quashed the dissent by summary courts martial and by executing many dissenters.\n\nIn May, Jelačić established the \"Bansko Vijeće\" (\"Ban Council\"). Its scope of authority covered ministerial tasks including Internal Affairs, Justice, Schools and Education, Religion, Finance, and Defense, so this council was acting as a governing body in Croatia. The new Sabor was summoned on 5 June.\n\nThe Austrian emperor called Jelačić to Innsbruck, to which the Imperial Court had fled, and the Emperor there told him that the Croatian and Slavonian troops in the Italian provinces wanted to join forces with those in Croatia, but that this would weaken the forces in Italy. So Jelačić called on all troops stationed in the Italian provinces to remain calm and to stay put.\n\nThe Austrian court did not grant the separation of Croatia from Hungary. During his travels back to Zagreb, Jelačić read in the Lienz railway station that on 10 June the Emperor had relieved him of all his positions. But Jelačić was still loyal to the Emperor, and kept relations with the Imperial Court, especially with Archduchess Sophia, the mother of Franz Joseph I of Austria.\n\nImmediately after arriving at Zagreb, Jelačić got the order to join the discussions with the Hungarian government in Vienna. During these, Jelačić stated that his position was derived from the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, while Lajos Batthyány called him \"a separatist\" seeking to break away from the Habsburg Monarchy. Jelačić called this a \"rebellion\". Batthyány warned Jelačić that this could mean war. Jelačić stopped the discussions, saying that \"civil war is the worst that could happen\" – but that he \"would not be intimidated by this, however shocking it might be to hear\". Negotiations were closed with Batthyány saying \"see you (on the river) Drava\" and with Jelačić responding \"no need to tire yourself. See you on the Danube.\"\n\nJelačić returned to Croatia. Hungarian troops had gathered on the border and hostile proclamations were made against him.\n\nIn August, Jelačić proclaimed a decree for the Croatians, where he denied accusations of separating Croatia in the name of Panslavism. In the decree he said\nHis closing words were:\n\nJelačić felt disorder growing in the Austrian Empire, and decided on immediate action. On 11 September at Varaždin he crossed the River Drava with 45,000 soldiers, and auxiliary troops (another 8,000 soldiers), led by Brigadier Karl Roth, crossed the Drava lower down.\n\nJelačić occupied Međimurje (), which was mostly Croatian. The two forces were poorly armed because of the rapid engagement. Materiel was not well organised, so the advance into Hungarian territory was difficult. Supplies were taken from the local population.\n\nThe Hungarian squadrons led by Count Ladislaus von Wrbna-Freudenthal, Baron Karl Freiherr Kreß von Kressenstein and Count Heinrich Graf zu Hardegg joined Jelačić's troops.\n\nThe enthusiasm of the Croatian troops grew when at Siófok the Ban received a letter from Ferdinand I cancelling the decree removing him from all positions, also promoting him to be general commander of all troops in Hungary.\n\nDuring his march toward Pest and Buda (now conjoined as the towns of Budapest), Jelačić got a message from Archduke Stephen, situated in Veszprém, to inform him of the decision of the Emperor that Lajos Batthyány was approved to set up a new government, and calling him to stop the troops, and to discuss further actions at his office. Jelačić replied he could not stop his army then, but was prepared for discussions with the archduke at the port of Balatonszemes. The meeting did not take place. According to Austrian sources, advisors to Jelačić persuaded him not to attend, because of a threat of assassination by agents of the Hungarian Government. After this fiasco, Palatine Stephen resigned and left Hungary, under the Emperor's orders.\n\nJelačić's army occupied Székesfehérvár on 26 September 1848. The same day the Emperor appointed lieutenant-general Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg as general commanding all troops in Hungary, but this was annulled by the Hungarian Parliament. Lajos Kossuth called the Hungarians for resistance, and the \"Országos Honvédelmi Bizottmány\" (National Homeguarding Committee) was given the power of execution. Lamberg, trying to take over the command of the Hungarian troops was identified and killed.\n\nJelačić advanced onward, reached Lake Velence on 29 September, where he met Hungarian troops. After the first strikes, lieutenant-general János Móga withdrew to north to Sukoró. Jelačić demanded Móga stand against the rebels, and \"get back to the road of honour and duty\", but Móga refused, and his army attacked Jelačić between his position and Pákozd.\n\nThe day after, 30 September, Jelačić asked for a three-day ceasefire; he wanted to use these days to wait for Roth's army. He assessed the greater numbers of the Hungarian troops and the poor armaments and tiredness of his own troops. On 1 October the supply routes to Croatia were cut by rebels, so he advanced toward Vienna. On 3 October Móga was pursuing after Jelačić, but did not want to make an attack.\n\nOn 4 October, Ferdinand I of Austria reappointed Jelačić as the general commander of all troops in Hungary, and dissolved the Hungarian Diet.\n\nAustrian Minister of War Theodor Baillet von Latour called the guards in Vienna to join the troops of Jelačić, but this caused a riot in Vienna on 6 October in which Latour was killed.\n\nOn 7 October Hungarian General Mór Perczel defeated the armies of General Roth and Josip Filipović, and took them prisoner. The Hungarian Parliament annulled the Emperor's decree of October 4.\n\nJelačić moved onward to Vienna to join the troops around the city. Under Lieutenant-General Todorović, he organised a body of 14,000 soldiers to move south to Stayer to protect Croatia.\n\nThe Viennese revolution committee called for aid from the Hungarian Government. On 10 October at Laaer Berg near Vienna, Jelačić joined Austrian troops led by Auersperg, and the army was strengthened with troops from Bratislava, a regiment of Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn and Franz Joseph I of Austria's regiment. Jelačić's forces were soon under Field Marshal Windisch-Grätz. On 21 October, seeing trouble ahead, Móga stopped at the Austrian border, and the revolution in Vienna was suppressed. Jelačić's forces were fighting in the Landstrasse, Erdberg and Weissgerber suburbs.\n\nOn 21 October – too late – Lajos Kossuth ordered Móga to turn back to Vienna, they met forces of Jelačić at Schwechat on 30 October. A day of artillery fighting broke out, and Jelačić initiated a counterattack in the evening. Led by General , the attack pushed back the Hungarian forces and defeated them. After this defeat, Móga stepped down as general commander, and Kossuth nominated general Artúr Görgey in his place.\n\nOn 2 December 1848 Ferdinand I of Austria abdicated, and Franz Joseph I of Austria was installed as Emperor. On 13 December Windisch-Grätz crossed the Hungarian border. On 16 December, Jelačić also crossed the border and defeated Hungarian troops at Parndorf, later occupying Mosonmagyaróvár and Győr. Being informed that Mór Perczel was stationed at Mór, Jelačić made a detour toward this city and defeated the Hungarian troops there, taking into custody 23 officers and 2,000 honvéd. With this battle, Pest-Buda became vulnerable, so the Hungarian government fled to Debrecen. Görgey could resist the march of Jelačić at Tétény for some time, but on 5 January Windisch-Grätz, together with Jelačić occupied Pest-Buda.\n\nAfter the occupation of Pest and Buda the larger campaigns were over. Windischgrätz declared a military dictatorship, caught the Hungarian leader Lajos Batthyány and asked for surrender. He moved to Debrecen but was stopped by Perczel at Szolnok and Abony. Kossuth nominated Henryk Dembiński to replace Artúr Görgey, and started a strategic counterattack but was defeated near Kápolna.\n\nWindisch-Grätz ordered Jelačić to quick march to Jászfényszaru. On 4 April Klapka attacked him but at Tápióbicske the bayonets of Jelačić pushed them back. On 5 March Damjanich reoccupied Szolnok. Jelačić now got a new order to turn from Jászfényszaru and head to Gödöllő. On 2 April Jelačić met János Damjanich at Tápióbicske and was defeated. On 6 April Windisch-Grätz and Jelačić, were defeated in the Battle of Isaszeg, retreating to Rákospatak, a suburb of Pest-Buda.\n\nAfter the defeat, Windisch-Grätz was relieved of general command, and was replaced by General Welden and later Julius Jacob von Haynau. Jelačić was ordered to gather the scattered troops in southern Hungary and to organise an army. This consisted of 15,800 infantry, 5,100 cavalry and 74 cannon, and moved to Osijek immediately. During his march south, Jelačić had to suppress rebellions, especially in Pécs. After a series of wrong decisions, Jelačić's army could not join up with the Emperor's, so it was put to defensive fights.\n\nIn May, 1849 Jelačić moved from Osijek to Vukovar, Ilok, Sremski Karlovci, Tovarnik and Irig. He set up base at Ruma.\n\nHe was in a bad situation, as the Austrians were calling for the help of Russian Empire to suppress the Hungarians and the support from Vienna dissolved. Jelačić was lacking proper materiel, and many of his troops died of cholera.\n\nThe Serbian troops, led by Kuzman Todorović, had to surrender strategic points to the honvédség (Hungarian Army). The Hungarians occupied and fortified Petrovaradin, where the troops received supplies because the population supported the Hungarian revolution. In April, Mór Perczel occupied Srbobran and broke up the encirclement of Petrovaradin, defeated Todorović so he could occupy Pančevo and finally, together with Józef Bem, occupied Temes County (now Timiş County, Romania).\n\nJelačić, cut off from all supplies, fortified his armies for defense and fought small battles in Slavonia. The supplies from the Austrian Empire were stuck at Stari Slankamen. In June he decided to break out and advance to Sombor – Dunaföldvár. During his march, on 6 June, Perczel attacked him near Kać and Žabalj. He defeated Perczel, marched forward, but could not occupy Novi Sad.\n\nOn 24 June he successfully occupied Óbecse, but was retaken by Hungarians on 28th. This way Jelačić could not dislodge the Hungarian forces from Bačka. On 6 July Richard Guyon drove out the Croatian troops at Mali Iđoš. On 14 July Hungarians took control over Feketić and Lovćenac, defeating Jelačić in the Battle of Hegyes. Jelačić had to retreat. This was the last battle in the region.\n\nAfter Timişoara fell, Jelačić joined Haynau's troops, and after the end of revolution, he traveled to Vienna to take part in discussions of reorganising Croatia, Slavonia and the frontier regions.\n\nWhen peace was restored, Jelačić returned to Croatia where he was treated as national hero, the saviour of the homeland.\nAfter the war the Empire's new constitution stripped the local authorities in Hungary of their political power, but this punishment also affected Croatia despite its assistance to the imperial cause during the revolution. Nevertheless, Jelačić implemented the new Constitution (published 4 March 1849), and proceeded to outlaw various newspapers that published anti-Austrian opinions. In 1851, when Baron Alexander von Bach came to power in the Kingdom of Hungary, Jelačić worked under him and made no objections to the Germanization of Croatia. He remained in office until his death.\n\nHe died on 20 May 1859 in Zagreb, after an illness. He is buried in Zaprešić, in a grave near his castle.\n\nIn his time and shortly after, Jelačić was a fairly unpopular figure among the Croatian political elite, including Ante Starčević and others, and especially among the people who suffered losses due to his military campaigns and had little benefit from his economic measures.\n\nToday, Jelačić is considered an important and admirable figure in Croatian history, alongside Ante Starčević, and Stjepan Radić, the Croatian political leader until 1928. The central square of the city of Zagreb was named Ban Jelačić Square in 1848, and a statue of him by Anton Dominik Fernkorn was erected in the square in 1866, removed under Communist rule in 1947, and reinstalled in 1990, after the fall of Communism.\n\nThe patriotic song \"Ustani bane\" (\"Rise, Ban\") was written to glorify Jelačić.\n\nIn Hungary, he is a very unpopular historical figure. He is often referred to as \"Jelasics the coward,\" who \"runs back to Vienna with his army beaten\", quote from Sándor Petőfi's poem \"A vén zászlótartó\".\n\nJelačić's portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 20 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2001.\n\nIn 2008, a total of 211 streets in Croatia were named after Josip Jelačić, making him the fourth most common person eponym of streets in the country.\n\nHe received the Military Order of Maria Theresa, the cross of order of Lipot from Franz Joseph. He was elected as Count on 24 April 1854 (as Jelačić von Bužim). He received medals from the Russian Tsar, the King of Saxony, King of Hanover, and Duke of Parma.\n\n"}
{"id": "33496985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33496985", "title": "Karol Cariola", "text": "Karol Cariola\n\nKarol Aída Cariola Oliva (born April 1, 1987) is a Chilean midwife, and former president of the \"Federación de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Concepción\" (University of Concepción Student Federation) for 2010. She was elected General Secretary of the Juventudes Comunistas de Chile, abbr. JJ.CC., (the youth wing of the Communist Party of Chile) at the organizations \"XIII Congress\" held in October 2011. Cariola is the second woman to hold this post in the Communist Youth of Chile after the late communist leader Gladys Marin (1941-2005).\nOn August the 4th, 2013 Cariola emerged as the leading congressional candidate in the New Majority coalition's primary elections for the electoral district of Recoleta and Independencia. \n\nSubsequently, during the Chilean general election held on November 17, 2013 she won 38.47% of the votes and became the deputy-elect for the 19th electoral Santiago district of Recoleta and Independencia. She commenced to serve a four-year term in the Chilean Congress on 11 March 2014.\n\nCariola was elected General Secretary of the JJ.CC. amidst one of the most significant mass social mobilization in recent Chilean history – referred by the media as the Chilean Winter. This mobilization saw students across Chile refuse to return to school or university, from April 2011 to the end of the academic year, in protest and to demand an end to the privatization of education. Cariola has stated that the student mobilization, protests and strikes had a political nature and she refuted the statement made by the Chilean government spokesperson Andrés Chadwick that the \"CONFECH\" (Chile’s Confederation of Student Unions) has been taken over by extremist elements.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Chile Cariola stated that it was a grave mistake to refer to the student movement in that manner: \n“\"I think our country is at a historic moment, that it is necessary to generate structural changes….We have had a process that has led this country to develop a new consciousness. Chile today is not the same that it was 6 months ago, there is an eagerness to generate changes and the need to do so\".” \n\nCariola has stated that \"Chile and its people have to draft a new constitution\" and has said that within the Nueva Mayoria coalition she intends to fight for a Constituent Assembly to oversee a change to the existing Chilean Constitution. Cariola - in line with the leader of the \"Nueva Mayoria\", Michelle Bachelet - believes that the Chilean Constitution is illegitimate because it was introduced in the absence of political democracy by the Pinochet regime on September 11, 1980. Cariola also states that if she wins a seat in the Chilean Chamber of Deputies she will work to see a fair labour code implemented with an institution to protect workers' rights and the automatic unionization of all workers in or entering the workforce.\n\nThe primary elections for the New Majority coalition commenced on August 4, 2013. These parliamentary primaries were set to determine which two candidates from the Nueva Mayoria pact in a given electorate will stand for the Chilean elections in November 2013. In the primary election for the 19th Santiago electorate of Recoleta-Independencia Cariola received the highest number of votes from the local constituents.\n\n\nKarol Cariola is currently a candidate for the Chilean parliamentary elections to be held in 2013. This strategy to reach political power by Cariola and other members of the Communist Youth and ex-leaders of the educational social mobilizations such as Camila Vallejo and Camilo Ballesteros, has been bitterly questioned by some student factions who consider it a betrayal to the principles of the mobilizations. Other critics point to her explicit support for the governments of Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez.\n\n\n\n"}

In ancient Greek and Roman times, the leading philosophers, playwrights, politicians and generals of the day often owned vineyards for personal use. Usually celebrities have a large amount of wealth accumulated, which makes the significant investment of opening a winery or vineyard negligible.\n\nThere are many reasons that celebrities gravitate to the world of wine. Starting a winery or vineyard, as with nearly any business, can offer some tax benefits. Some celebrities, such as the Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, come from a family with a long history of winemaking. Some, such as the British singer Cliff Richard, have been lifelong wine enthusiasts and enter the wine industry in order to do something that they enjoy. Others like the challenge of a new enterprise. Some celebrities enter the wine industry simply because they can.\n\nWhile some celebrities, such as the American actors Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp, British association football star David Beckham and his wife Victoria Beckham, own vineyards and wine estates solely for personal use, some celebrities leverage their name recognition as a selling tool in the wine industry. Today celebrity-owned wineries can be lucrative business endeavors. In 2007, Nielsen research of supermarket wine purchases showed that sales of celebrity wines were up 19% over previous years.\n\nCelebrities have different degrees of involvement in their wineries and vineyards. Nearly all of them partner, in some form of collaboration, with a winery or winemaker who is already established in the industry. An example of this is retired American football player Joe Montana, who partnered with longtime Beringer winemaker Ed Sbragia to make their joint venture wine Montagia. While Sbragia oversees most of the viticultural and winemaking tasks, Montana is involved in deciding on the overall \"vision\" of the wine and participates in tasting and blending trials.\n\nSimilarly, the celebrity may own their own \"wine brand\" which is produced with their collaborating winery instead of owning a physical winery or wine estate itself. An example of this is the brand Mike Ditka Wines, owned by former American football coach Mike Ditka. The wine is produced in partnership at the physical winemaking facilities of the Mendocino Wine Company. While it could be described as a \"winery\", technically Mike Ditka Wines is a \"wine brand\" owned by Ditka, who participates in blending and tasting trials. Other celebrities, such as French actor Gérard Depardieu, are very active in both the production and business dealings of the winery. Depardieu, who owns wineries in several countries across the globe, even has his passport listing his occupation as \"vigneron\".\nSome celebrities may only have \"legacy\" attachments to the wines that bear their names. One example is the Gallo wine brand MacMurray Ranch, which uses some grapes grown on a California ranch that was once owned by the American actor Fred MacMurray. Under his ownership, the ranch was dedicated mostly to raising horses. After MacMurray died, his family sold most of the land to the Gallo family, and has little connection to the wine brand. \n\nAnother \"legacy\" celebrity who was more intimately connected with the winery that now carries his name was the American actor Raymond Burr. Burr bought the ranch with his domestic partner and planted grapevines for wine production before he died in 1993. His partner, Robert Benevides, renamed the estate after Burr and continued making wines featuring his name.\n\nSome celebrities lend their names to a winery for a special one-time wine production. Mexican-American musician Carlos Santana partnered with the Champagne house G.H. Mumm to create a sparkling wine in 2005 titled Santana DVX. While Santana helped select the final blend and received royalties for the use of his name and image, he doesn't particularly \"own\" the brand nor does he continue to be involved in the wine industry.\n\nAmerican musician Bob Dylan participated in a similar arrangement with the Italian winery Fattoria Le Terrazze. Dylan gave permission for the winery to use his name, likeness and album art to create a wine that pays tribute to his 1974 album \"Planet Waves\". In 2007, American entrepreneur Martha Stewart announced a collaboration with the American winery Gallo to produce value-marketed wines to be sold at Kmart, which also featured her Martha Stewart Living line of housewares. In 2009, British chef Gordon Ramsay allowed a Bordeaux winery to use his name, without royalties, to celebrate the release of their 10th vintage.\n\nIn 2009, actor Gianni Russo launched his wine brand, Gianni Russo Wines. \n\nLegendary Hollywood Tough Guy, Robert Davi acquired a stake in Georgós Greek Wine Company, Sonoma Valley, California in August 2018 after he purchased a bottle of their wine at a Whole Foods Market. He called Georgós, \"One of the smoothest damn wines I've ever had.\" \n\n\"Below is a partial listing of celebrities who own commercial wineries, wine brands or vineyards. This is not a listing of a celebrities who only own vineyards for private use.\"\n"}

Daw and his family in Australia are refugees from the civil wars in Sudan. Daw became the first Sudanese Australian to be drafted to an AFL club when he was contracted to North Melbourne in the 2009 AFL Draft. Daw's drafting gained international attention; it was reported by the BBC and the Voice of America. Majak Daw made his first appearance for North Melbourne in a NAB Cup match on 20 February 2011.\n\nDaw was born in Khartoum, Sudan, the third of his parents' nine children. His family fled the Second Sudanese Civil War, living in Egypt for three years, then moved to Australia in 2003.\n\nPlaying for the Western Jets Daw was identified as a future \"key position\" player by North Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs.\nDaw went to the 2009 Victorian Screening portion of the AFL pre-draft testing.\nHe impressed with a 13.6 in the beep test and 3.03 seconds in a 20-metre sprint along with a standing jump of 70 centimetres. He was one of 11 young Australian rules footballers to be given 2010 Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarships awarded by the AFL Players Association, and accepted the awards on behalf of the other players.\n\nDaw was picked up with the ninth pick in the 2010 rookie draft. His draft pick gained international media attention. His career at North Melbourne began with playing for VFL club Werribee, where he continued to develop his game. He made his first appearance for North Melbourne in a pre-season NAB cup match against the Western Bulldogs on 20 February 2011. In April 2011, playing for Werribee, Daw kicked an impressive running goal from beyond 50 m out, prompting calls for his inclusion to the senior team.\n\nOn 4 June 2011, Majak Daw was racially abused by a Port Melbourne Football Club supporter, while he was playing for the Werribee Tigers in the VFL. Daw stated that it \"made [him] feel really small\". The man has since been banned from all VFL games until he completes an anti-racism workshop and formally apologises to Daw for the slur. The incident has led to renewed calls to stamp out racism in sport, with former Victorian Premier, Ted Baillieu, calling Daw a hero.\n\nDaw was suspended from North Melbourne in February 2012 and remanded to the Werribee Tigers for an indefinite period for lying to the club and coach Brad Scott about a \"night on the town\" during a period in which he was recovering from knee surgery.\n\nIn 2013, Daw had an excellent showing in the 2013 NAB Cup which prompted calls for his inclusion in the Senior Side. When tall forward Robbie Tarrant went down with a thigh injury, Daw was brought in to replace him and make his debut in Round 4 against the Brisbane Lions. In the first minute of the game, Daw marked the ball inside 50, and kicked his first AFL goal with his first AFL kick. However, his debut ended on a sour note when he collided with teammate Ben Cunnington and suffered a concussion before quarter time, and took no further part in the game. North went on to win the game by 63 points.\n\nDaw held his spot and played the next week, scoring no goals but three behinds against Hawthorn. In Round 7 against the Western Bulldogs, Majak had a breakout performance in just his fourth career game, kicking a game-high 6 goals in North's 54 point win. After the match, North Melbourne coach Brad Scott said of Majak: \"'Maj' is a good example of what you can do with really hard work. Hard work trumps talent any day of the week.\"\n\nHe was delisted in October 2015, however, he was re-drafted in the 2016 rookie draft. \n\nIn 2016, Majak Daw won mark of the year after taking a specky against Collingwood. Majak played the most games in a season in his career at that point with nine in addition to playing in his first final, which was in the elimination final against and kicking four goals despite North Melbourne losing 141–79.\n\nIn 2017, after having a season full of injuries and only managing to play seven games in total, at the end of the 2017 AFL season Daw eyed versatility as an AFL player, \"it's a unique position. There aren't many players who can do that role well. It’s challenging, because you’ve got to be able to play both positions well.\"\n\nIn the 2018 offseason, Daw daw changed his position from a forward to a defender. Daw sought this change as he thought it was his last chance at thriving in the AFL. Majak played his first game as a defender against in the AFLX series. Later on in round 3 against , Daw officially played his first game as a defender. Ever since debuting in his first game as a defender Daw has lead North Melbourne to the number 2 defense in the AFL making his change from a forward to a defender a successful move in his career and for the promising future of North Melbourne Football Club.\n\nOn 1 July 2014, Daw was charged with three counts of rape relating to an alleged sexual assault incident in Altona North in 2007. He had been previously arrested and interviewed over the allegations in May 2014. Daw denied the allegations, while North Melbourne stated that he would remain available for selection.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, Daw was found not guilty on all counts.\n\n"}

{"id": "8459532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8459532", "title": "Martin Parmer", "text": "Martin Parmer\n\nMartin Parmer (born Martin Palmer June 4, 1778 – March 2, 1850) was an eccentric 19th-century American frontiersman, statesman, politician and soldier.\n\nThe Virginia-born Palmer, (who would later change the spelling of his surname to Parmer) made a name for himself as an Indian fighter in the Missouri Territory prior to Missouri's admission as a State in the Union. During this time he acquired his sobriquet, \"The Ringtailed Panther,\" by which he would be known throughout Missouri and later Texas. When Missouri became a state, Parmer was elected a State Representative to the First Missouri General Assembly. Later Parmer was elected a State Senator to the Third Missouri General Assembly. While serving as a State Senator, William Clark (explorer) appointed Martin Parmer as an Indian sub-agent to the Ioway Indians.\n\nMartin Parmer first came to Texas in the 1825 as part of Haden Edwards's colony. Conditions between the settlers Edwards had relocated in Texas and older settlers in the area steadily deteriorated. On October 15, 1826, Otto Askins swore out an affidavit stating that Parmer had murdered his brother Moton Askins:\n\nSamuel Norris, the Alcalde of Nacogdoches, issued a warrant for Parmer's arrest:\n\nWith the issuance of the arrest warrant for murder, Parmer would normally have had two options, 1) He could flee back into the United States, or 2) He could allow himself to be arrested and stand trial for murder. Neither of these options appealed to Parmer, so six weeks later, on November 23, 1826, Martin Parmer rode into Nacogdoches at the head of a force of men from the Ayish Bayou District and arrested all the government officials including Samuel Norris and Hayden Edwards and assumed control of the local government. One of Parmer's first actions was to order that all Americans in Nacogdoches be compelled to bear arms.\n\nParmer conducted a \"Courts Martial\" of the local government officials for which he sat as the Judge. With the exception of Hayden Edwards, Martin Parmer found all the government officials guilty and sentenced them to death. He commuted their sentences on the promise of each that they would leave Texas and never return. Following the trial, Parmer left Joseph Durst in charge as the Alcalde in Nacogdoches and returned to Ayish Bayou.\nIn December 1826, Parmer led the Fredonian Rebellion, declaring the area around Nacogdoches the independent Republic of Fredonia. The preamble of the Fredonian Declaration of Independence set out the grievances of the parties:\n\nThe Fredonian Declaration of Independence was signed as follows:\nEmpresario Stephen F. Austin strongly opposed the Fredonian rebels and encouraged the settlers in his colony to fight on behalf of Mexico in the conflict. In a letter to his colonists dated January 1, 1827, Stephen F. Austin mentioned Martin Parmer's role as leader of the rebellion:\n\nThe Fredonian Republic stood for just over a month; Parmer fled to Louisiana when the Mexican army arrived in Nacogdoches at the end of January 1827.\n\nParmer returned to Texas in 1831 and was an early figure in the history of the Republic of Texas. Frank W. Johnson, a leader in the Texas Revolution, provided the following account of Parmer's return to Texas in 1831 in the company of James Bowie:\n\nDuring the Texas Revolution, Parmer served as a delegate from the District of Teneha to the Consultation of 1835 at San Felipe. While serving as a delegate to the Consultation (Texas), Parmer placed Henry Smith's name into nomination for Governor of Texas. Henry Smith (Texas Governor) was elected Governor of Texas by the Consultation becoming the first American-born Governor of the Mexican territory of Texas. Later, at the Consultation, Parmer was elected a member of the General Council of Texas.\n\nShortly thereafter, Parmer was elected a delegate from the Municipality of San Augustine to the Convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos which began on March 1, 1836. On March 2, 1836, delegate Sam Houston moved for the adoption of the Texas Declaration of Independence and Martin Parmer seconded the motion.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was unanimously approved by the Convention and Parmer signed the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico. Parmer was chairman of the committee that drafted the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. On March 6, 1836, the day the Alamo fell, Martin Parmer penned a letter to his wife from the Convention at Washington:\n\nCharles B. Stewart, a delegate from the Municipality of Austin to the Convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos, was attributed the following quote regarding Martin Parmer:\n\nStephen W. Blount, another delegate to the Convention from the Municipality of San Augustine, gave the following account of Martin Parmer:\n\nParmer's activities during the Texas Revolution did not end with his services at the Convention. On March 16, 1836, as the Convention neared its conclusion, delegate Thomas Jefferson Rusk, the newly appointed Secretary of War, wishing to alleviate the shortage of supplies within the Texas army, proposed the following resolution giving Martin Parmer some rather extraordinary powers:\n\nParmer issued scrip for all the property he received on behalf of the new Republic of Texas. He signed the scrip: \"Martin Parmer, Agent for Texas.\"\n\nIn 1839, Republic of Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar appointed Martin Parmer Chief Justice of Jasper County, Texas. Parmer died in Jasper County, Texas on Texas Independence Day March 2, 1850. His body was re-interred in the Texas State Cemetery in 1936 at the time of the Texas Centennial. He was buried some thirty feet away from the grave of Stephen F. Austin who had so vigorously opposed Parmer's early attempt to declare Texas independent of Mexico during the Fredonian Rebellion.\n\nIn 1874, Tom Parmer published a biographical booklet about the adventures of his father, Martin Parmer, on the Missouri frontier titled \"Fifty-Five Years Ago in the Wilderness or The Old Ringtail Panther of Missouri\". Martin Parmer appeared as a major character in Joseph Alexander Altsheler's Texan historical fiction series: \"The Texan Star, the story of a great fight for liberty\" (1912); \"The Texan Scouts, the story of the Alamo and Goliad\" (1913); and \"The Texan Triumph, a romance of the San Jacinto campaign\" (1913). In 1966, Martin Parmer appeared as a character in Giles A. Lutz's book \"The Hardy Breed\" an historical fiction about the Fredonian Rebellion.\n\nThe Texas Legislature established Parmer County, Texas in 1876. Parmer County is named in honor of Martin Parmer \"an eccentric Texan of olden time, and one of the signers of the Declaration of Texas Independence.\" In January 1882, the Capitol Syndicate agreed to build the Texas State Capitol in return for 3,000,000 acres of land in West Texas. Parmer County lay entirely within the lands granted to the Chicago Syndicate for its huge XIT Ranch.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3728845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3728845", "title": "Matsyendra", "text": "Matsyendra\n\nMatsyendra, Matsyendranātha, Macchindranāth or Mīnanātha (early 10th century) was a saint and yogi in a number of Buddhist and Hindu traditions. He is traditionally considered the founder of hatha yoga as well as the author of some of its earliest texts. He is also seen as the founder of the natha \"sampradaya\", having received the teachings from Shiva. He is especially associated with kaula shaivism. He is also one of the eighty-four mahasiddhas and considered the guru of Gorakshanath, another important figure in early hatha yoga. He is revered by both Hindus and Buddhists and is sometimes regarded as an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara.\n\nLittle is known about the life of Matsyendra: his son is Minanatha and he is also associated with Lui-Pa, all of whose names translate as 'Lord of the Fishes'. Legends vary in describing his birthplace. Giuseppe Tucci states, on the authority of two Tibetan works - the \"Siddha\" () and Taranatha's \"Possessing the Seven Transmissions\" () - that Matsyendranāth, who is seen in Tibet as an avatar of Avalokiteśvara, was a fisherman from Kamarupa.\n\nLegends tell that Matsyendra was born under an inauspicious star. This warranted his parents to throw the baby into the ocean. It is here that the baby was swallowed by a fish where he lived for many years. The fish swam to the bottom of the ocean where Shiva was imparting the secrets of yoga to his consort, Parvati. Upon overhearing the secrets of yoga, Matsyendra began to practice yoga sadhana inside the fish's belly. After twelve years he finally emerged as an enlightened Siddha. This is often given as the origin of his name 'Lord of the Fishes' or 'He Whose Lord is the Lord of the Fishes'. Other versions of the legend exist, including one in which Matsyendra was born as a fish and turned into a Siddha by Shiva. Tibetan renditions of the story tell of a fisherman turned Siddha named Mina who is eaten by a fish while working in the Bay of Bengal. Some scholars draw parallels between this legend and the Biblical story of Jonah and the Whale.\n\nAnother legend says that, when Gorakshanath visited Patan, he captured all the rain-showering serpents of Patan and started to meditate after he was disappointed by the locals as they did not grant him any alms on his request. As a result, Patan faced drought for a long time. The king of Patan, on the advice of his advisers, invited Matsyendranath, Gorakshanath's guru, to Patan. When Gorakshanath learned that his teacher was in Patan, he released all the rain showering serpents and went to see him. As soon as the rain showering serpents were set free, Patan again got plenty of rainfall every year. After that day, the locals of Patan worshiped Matsyendranath as the god of rain.\nYet another legend says, the Virya or Sperm of Brahma is responsible for birth of various saints and prophets on earth. The Brahma Virya is unlike human beings. It was said to fertilise any living form and carried within it the utmost principles and moral values. It fell on various parts of earth at the advent of Kali Yuga (i.e. age of machines in Hindu scriptures).\nIt was decided so to spread moral values on earth by the Supreme Godhead, Brahma. The Virya fell into the mouth of a fish and it became pregnant. Once inside the egg, flowing through the river, the fish and egg inside reached to a secluded spot where Lord Rudra Shankar was teaching the principles of creation to Mother Parvati. When Parvati asked\nShankara, \"What is the base of all Illusionary Creation\", an answer came from the Egg, \"Brahma Tatva\" or \"God Element\". Stumped by the right answer, Lord Shankara started looking into the river, and he saw the child inside the egg. He immediately recognised the child as \"Kavi Narayan\", the poetic Avatar of Lord Krishna or Hari. He then blessed the child and told him that he would give him the benediction once he was 12 years old.\nWhen its egg was fertilised, the fish was washed ashore on the banks of a sea in Maharashtra. A fisherman couple who had no child saw the egg being pecked by storks. As soon as the egg cracked the baby came out crying loudly.\nThe fisher man then realised this miracle and with compassion in his mind, took the baby home. The baby was named Machhindranath - Macch (meaning) fish, Indra means (God Indra) Nath (meaning) Lord - thus lord of the Sea Fish. \nMachhindranath grew up to be compassionate, aloof from material things. His fisherman foster father insulted him once over throwing caught fish back into water. He said to him that he would become a beggar if he didn't know how to make a living. The enlightened child judged it better to beg and eat sinless food then to make a sinful living in killing. After that Machhindranath ran away from home and went to Badrinath and meditated there living on fruits and water for 12 years continuously. What remained out of him was his skin sucked-up to his skeleton. Then he was greeted by Lord Datta and Lord Shiva (Rudra) and taught all mystics of warfare and miracles which he used for uplifting mankind and saving them from evil that Kali Yuga has spread. From then on, Machhindranath became a Siddha who could see Time from Time Beginning till Time End.\n\nMatsyendra is credited with composing Hatha and Tantric works such as the \"Kaulajñānanirnāya\" (\"Discussion of the Knowledge Pertaining to the Kaula Tradition\"), the Matsyendrasamhita and \"Akula-Viratantra\", some of the earliest texts on hatha yoga in Sanskrit in the eleventh century. James Mallinson, Alexis Sanderson, David Gordon White and others theorize that many works were attributed to him posthumously.\n\nMatsyendranath is typically listed as having eight disciples. The list of his disciples varies between different temples and lineages, but commonly includes Gorakshanath, Jalandharnath, Kanifnath (Kanhoba), Gahininath, Bhartrinath, Revan Nath, Charpatinath and Naganath. Along with Matsyendranath, they are called the Navnath. While Gorkshanath is generally considered a direct disciple of Matsyendranath, it is likely they lived hundreds of years apart.\n\nMacchindranāth (or Bunga Dyah in Newari) is a god of rain worshiped by both Hindus and Buddhists in Nepal. Hindus regard him as an incarnation of Shiva while Buddhists regard him as an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara. The temple of Macchindranāth lies in the southern part of the Patan Durbar Square since 1673.\n\nRato Matsyendranath of Patan, Nepal <br>\n\nHyangu (red) Macchindranath temple also known as Temple of Bunga: Dyaa: as it resides in Bungamati and also in Patan, also known as the Rato Macchindranath Temple, is one of the oldest Matsyendranath temples, dating back from the 16th century. It lies in the southern part of the Patan Durbar Square. Each of the four well-crafted wooden doors of this temple is guarded by two lion figures while the four corners of the temple are guarded by khyah, a yeti-like figure. The murti of Rato Macchindranath (Matsyendranath) spends six months of the year in this temple. The village of Bungamati, regarded in Nepal as the birthplace of Matsyendranath, is a traditional Newar town located from downtown Kathmandu. The temple of Rato Macchindranath is located in the heart of this village and it is known as his second home. After the chariot festival, Rato Macchindranath spends the next six month in this temple.\n\nSeto Matsyendranath of Kathmandu, Nepal <br>\nToyu (white) Macchindranath temple also known as JanaBaha: Dyaa: as it resides in JanaBaha: in Kathmandu in another important Macchindranath temple in Nepal. White Machhindranath(Matsyendranath) is also known as Jana-baha Dyo since the temple is located at Jana Baha(Bahal).\n<br>\nBhote Jatra (भोटे जात्रा)/ Chariot Festival\n\nThe most important event connected with the deity is the annual chariot procession known as Bunga Dyah Jatra or Rato Macchindranath Jatra. Each year, the locals of Patan, Lalitpur celebrate the festival in order to show respect to the rain god. This festival is one of the oldest and the longest festival celebrated in Patan and is celebrated in April–May.\n\nIt is celebrated just before the monsoon season starts so that the city will get plenty rainfall for good growth of crops. During the procession, the image of Bunga Dyah is placed on a tall chariot about 65 feet high and pulled in stages through the streets of Patan for a month.\n\nBefore the chariot festival starts the ritual of Mahasnana is conducted in an auspicious hour as indicated by the astrologers about 15 days before the chariot festival. The deity is taken to a platform at Lagankhel which is about 200 meters away from the temple of Machindranath at Ta: bahal Lalitpur. There in front of a huge crowd, the god is given a bath with the sacred water mixture of honey, milk, and water fetched by the panejus or priests in the four silver kalasa(vessel). The four priests then pour the sacred water or jal from four directions in the platform to the deity and it is believed that from whichever direction 1st the jal touches the deity from the same direction monsoon will start or first rain will be granted.\n\nAfter the mahasnana, the repairs are done to the idol of the deity if required and the new face is painted. After the face painting is over various ritual are performed to the deity-like Bareychukegu; Ihi; Bara tyegu as done to a human and at the end Dashakarma vidhi is performed.\nWhile these all are going to the temple premises, the chariot or ratha is made at Pulchowk by the Barahi and Yawal clans, amongst which one only does the rope work and other only the woodwork. In the construction of the chariot, no nails are used to connect the joints of the huge chariot but are only tied with ropes and veds. The only part that uses an iron to hold are the four wheels. After the construction is finished the deity is ascended in the divine vehicle i.e. 3 days before the pulling of the chariot.\n\nThe route of the chariot procession starts at Pulchwok and passes through Gabahal, Sundhara, Lagankhel and ends at Jawalakhel.Previously the festival was called the festival of three states viz. Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur as the deity was brought by the alliance of these three states. So, previously the 1st day of the festival was to be carried on by people of Kathmandu then by Bhaktapur and then 3rd by Lalitpur, and on last day all three sister cities come together for Jawalakhel Jatra with other nearby city people from Kirtipur and others from the valley.\n\nAfter the chariot reached Jawalakhel, this festival concludes with Bhoto Jatra, which literally means \"vest festival\". During the ceremony, a government official holds up a sacred jewel-studded black vest from the four sides of the chariot so that all the people gathered around can have a look at it.\n\nAfter the festival, the chariot is dismantled and Rato Macchindranath is taken to a temple in the nearby village of Bungamati, also known as the second home of the rain god. Rato Macchindranath spends the next six months in that temple.\n\n\nIn the \"Dasam Granth\", Guru Gobind Singh narrated a huge discourse between Matsyendra Nath and Paras Nath on Intuitive (Bibek) and Non-Intuitive Mind (Abibek). Parasnatha subdued kings of the world and turned egoistic, and was broken by Matsyendranatha's spiritual preachings. This granth is regarded among Spiritual warriors of Khalsa Panths called Nihang Singhs.\n\nThere are a few films about this legend in Indian cinema.\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "5075291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5075291", "title": "Mike Love", "text": "Mike Love\n\nMichael Edward Love (born March 15, 1941) is an American singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beach Boys. Characterised by his nasal and sometimes baritone singing, Love has been one of the band's vocalists and lyricists for their entire career, contributing to each of their studio albums. He is often regarded as a malign figure in the band's history, a reputation he acknowledges: \"For those who believe that Brian [Wilson] walks on water, I will always be the Antichrist.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Love was one of Wilson's collaborators during a string of US top 10 singles for the Beach Boys, including \"Fun, Fun, Fun\" (1964), \"California Girls\" (1965), and \"Good Vibrations\" (1966). His lyrics primarily reflected the youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, which helped fashion pop culture's perception of the \"California Dream\". Starting in 1968, Love was a student of Transcendental Meditation (TM) under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and became a TM teacher in 1971. The experience influenced his lyrics to take on themes of astrology, meditation, politics and ecology. In the late 1970s, Love began working on solo albums, releasing his first in 1981: \"Looking Back with Love\". In 1988, he, along with the other founding members of the Beach Boys, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The same year, the song, \"Kokomo\", co-written by Love, reached number one in the United States and was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nMany of Love's contributions to the group's hits were not officially recognized until the 1990s, when he successfully sued for writing credits on 35 songs. He remains uncredited for another 44 Beach Boys songs he alleged to have co-written. In 1998, following the death of cousin Carl Wilson, Love was given an exclusive license to tour under the name the Beach Boys. His surviving bandmates, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine, embarked on solo endeavors. In 2011, the group reunited to produce a new album and embark on a tour for their 50th anniversary. Following the 50th anniversary reunion shows, Love resumed touring only with Bruce Johnston.\n\nLove's mother, Emily (known as \"Glee\") Wilson, was the sister of Mary and Murry Wilson, a family resident in Los Angeles since the early 1920s. Glee married Edward Milton Love, the son of the founder of the Love Sheet Metal Company, in 1938. Michael Edward, the first of six children, was born in the Baldwin Hills district of Los Angeles, in 1941; thereafter the family moved to the upmarket View Park area. Mike attended Dorsey High School and graduated in 1959. Unsure of a career direction, he pumped gas and briefly joined his father's company, whose fortunes dramatically declined in the late 1950s. Both Milt and Glee Love were active in sports, and Glee had a distinct interest in painting and the arts. Like her brother, Murry, however, she was also strong-willed and, according to her husband, a dominant personality. The family was close-knit and regularly socialized with Murry and Audree Wilson and their sons. Murry Wilson was a part-time songwriter.\n\nMike Love often sang at family get-togethers at his cousins, the Wilsons', home in nearby Hawthorne, especially at Christmas. It was here, under the vocal harmony guidance of Brian Wilson, that the Beach Boys sound was established, predominantly influenced by Brian's devotion to the Four Freshmen's arrangements. Musical accompaniment during this formative phase was solely Brian's self-taught piano, but this was quickly expanded by the guitar contributions of Brian's college friend Al Jardine (whose fundamental interest was folk music) and Carl Wilson (whose idol was Chuck Berry). With the failure of Love Sheet Metal, the family was forced to move to a modest two-bedroom house in Inglewood, closer to the Wilsons.\n\nLove played rudimentary saxophone in the first years of the fledgling garage band that evolved from the Pendletones to the Beach Boys. He also established himself, along with neighbor Gary Usher, local DJ Roger Christian, and others, as a collaborator with Brian Wilson in the band's original compositions. Carl Wilson commented that \"It's not widely known, but Michael had a hand in a lot of the arrangements. He would bring out the funkier approaches, whether to go \"shoo-boo-bop\" or \"bom-bom-did-di-did-did\". It makes a big difference, because it can change the whole rhythm, the whole color and tone of it.\" He also credited Love, an avid fan of doo-wop combos, with influencing Brian to listen to black R&B records. Writer Geoffrey Himes stated that without \"Mike's R&B influence ... Brian couldn’t have possibly become 'Brian Wilson.'\" To write many of the Beach Boys songs, Love drew inspiration from the lyrics of Chuck Berry along with Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who wrote many of the Everly Brothers' songs including \"Devoted to You\" and \"All I Have to Do is Dream\". He explained, \"They were both the fun, descriptive pictorial vignettes as well as the more sweet, romantic and devotional lyrics. ... Even before that and more fundamental than that, I was always into poetry.\"\n\nIn early 1964, Brian Wilson began shifting the Beach Boys away from beach-themed music. That November, Love told a \"Melody Maker\" reporter that he and his band mates wanted to look beyond surf music and avoid living in the past or resting on the band's laurels. Love is also credited with naming their album \"Pet Sounds\" (1966). However, he has also been reported as resisting the group's new direction. In a 1971 \"Rolling Stone\" article, business associate David Anderle quoted Love saying \"don't fuck with the formula\". Over the ensuing years, the quote was repeated in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs. In the description of music journalist Erik Hedegaard, Love gathered a reputation as \"one of the biggest assholes in the history of rock & roll\" due to such accusations.\n\nAnderle later said that his statement about \"the formula\" had been misinterpreted, explaining that the quote was in reference to affairs related to the band's management, not their artistic direction. Love dismissed most of the reported claims as hyperbole: \"I never said anything bad about any of the tracks. I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on \"Smile\"\". Brian said that he requested Capitol to keep the \"Smile\" album unreleased and that he was not influenced by Love's opposition to the lyrics. Session musician Van Dyke Parks, who was hired by Brian as the album's lyricist, blamed Love with putting \"a stop\" on the album and said that he realized \"my opportunity to do this little American quilt work with him called \"Smile\" was over and done with\" once Brian came to be \"surrounded by so many people\".\n\nLove returned to co-writing with Brian for the Beach Boys' 1967 album \"Wild Honey\", the group's first foray into R&B. That same year, Love became one of the many rock musicians who discovered the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi following the Beatles' public endorsement of his Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique in August 1967. In December, Love and his bandmates attended a lecture by the Maharishi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris, and were moved by the simplicity and effectiveness of his meditation process as a means to obtaining inner peace. In January 1968, the Beach Boys attended the Maharishi's public appearances in New York and Cambridge, Massachusetts, after which he invited Love to join the Beatles at his training seminar in Rishikesh in northern India. Love stayed there from February 28 to March 15. He later recalled helping Paul McCartney with the lyrics of \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", recorded for the Beatles' White Album (1968).\n\nWhile in Rishikesh, Love planned a US concert tour that would feature the Beach Boys and the Maharishi as co-headliners. The tour begun in May 1968 ended abruptly after five shows due to the disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's subsequent withdrawal to fulfill film contracts. In his 2016 autobiography, Love wrote: \"I take responsibility for an idea that didn't work. But I don't regret it. I thought I could do some good for people who were lost, confused, or troubled, particularly those who were young and idealistic but also vulnerable, and I thought that was true for a whole bunch of us.\" Despite the ignominy of the tour, the Beach Boys remained ardent supporters of the Maharishi and TM. He became a TM initiator in 1972 and later progressed to more advanced levels such as the TM-Sidhi Course.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Love wrote the words and music of several Beach Boys songs, including \"Big Sur\" (1973), \"Everyone's in Love With You\" (1976) and \"Sumahama\" (1978). In 1978, he co-founded the band Celebration, which achieved the US top 30 hit single \"Almost Summer\" (co-written with Brian Wilson and Jardine). In 1981, he released his first solo album, \"Looking Back with Love\" (1981), with production by Curt Boettcher.\n\nIn 1988, the group had a US number 1 hit with \"Kokomo\", the only number 1 the band achieved without Brian's involvement. Love (along with \"Kokomo\" co-writers Scott McKenzie, Terry Melcher, and John Phillips) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award (1988) in the Original Song category, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Kokomo\". Also in 1988, Love was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with the other founding members of the Beach Boys. At the induction ceremony Love delivered a hostile speech, criticizing, among others, Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney. When asked in 2016 if he regretted anything about the night, Love said \"Yeah, I regret that I didn't meditate [earlier that day].\"\n\nIn 1992, Love, along with Al Jardine and several of Wilson's family members, sued Brian for defamation regarding claims made in the 1991 memoir \"\". The case was settled out of court by publisher HarperCollins, who awarded Love $1.5 million. It was the first of numerous lawsuits that Love would file against Brian. Two years later, Love won a legal proceeding to establish what he considered to be proper authorship credit for many of the Beach Boys songs he co-wrote. Love successfully argued that Murry Wilson avoided crediting him with his early lyrical contributions to Brian's songs, denying Love accrued royalties. He later called it \"almost certainly the largest case of fraud in music history\".\n\nAfter the death of Carl Wilson in 1998, Love continued to tour with the Beach Boys, along with Bruce Johnston and a supporting band of new musicians, occasionally including actor John Stamos. He leased exclusive rights to tour under the Beach Boys name in a boardroom settlement with Brother Records, the Beach Boys' company.\n\nIn 2000, ABC-TV premiered a two-part television miniseries, \"\", that dramatized the Beach Boys' story. It was produced by John Stamos, and was criticized for historical inaccuracies. Love was as an advisor to the film. Some critics accused him of having the film overstate his role in the group and portray negative depictions of Brian and \"Smile\" collaborator Van Dyke Parks.\n\nOn November 3, 2005 Love sued Brian and \"The Mail On Sunday\" newspaper because the Beach Boys' name and Love's image were used in a promotional CD that was given free with the paper to promote the 2004 \"Brian Wilson presents Smile\" release. Love argued that the unauthorized (by Brother Records Inc.) free CD resulted in loss of income for the band. The lawsuit was dismissed on May 16, 2007 on the grounds that it was without merit.\n\nIn 2011, Love reunited with Brian, Jardine, Johnston and David Marks for a new Beach Boys album and 50th anniversary tour beginning in 2012. In September 2012, Love and Bruce Johnston announced via a press release that following the end of the reunion tour the Beach Boys would revert to the Love/Johnston lineup, without Wilson, Jardine or Marks, all of whom expressed surprise. Although such dates were noted in a late June issue of \"Rolling Stone\", it was widely reported that the three had been \"fired\".\n\nHis autobiography, \"\", was published on September 13, 2016. Love wrote the book as a response to \"many inaccuracies\" that had been said about him over the decades. It was published one month before the release of Wilson's autobiography, \"\". When asked about the book's negative comments toward Love, Love responded: \"He's not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there's not tape of it.\" As of November 2016, he has not read Wilson's book.\n\nOn November 17, 2017, Love released his second solo album \"Unleash the Love\".\n\nLove has been married to Jacquelyne Piesen since 1994 and has eight children: two with Piesen and six from his four previous marriages. Love is a vegetarian who practices and teaches Transcendental Meditation, wears Indian Ayurveda rings and partakes in traditional Hindu ceremonies. He currently resides in Incline Village at Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\n\nIn addition to being cousin to the Wilson brothers, Love is the brother of former NBA basketball player Stan Love and of Pink Martini harpist Maureen Love and is the uncle of Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player Kevin Love.\n\nLove describes himself as a progressive, although a photographed handshake between him and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s led many to label him as a political conservative.\n\nLove has been a longtime supporter of environmental causes and was among speakers at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and Earth Day 2000 on the Mall in Washington, DC. Love was instrumental in forming StarServe (\"Students Taking Action and Responsibility to Serve\") which enlisted high-profile celebrities to inspire America's youth to help serve their communities. He also created the Love Foundation, which supports national environmental and educational initiatives. Love personally donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross to benefit the victims of Hurricane Katrina and helped the foundation raise an additional $250,000. He has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Lake Tahoe School in Incline Village, Nevada, and was responsible for raising over $1 million to benefit the school.\n\nIn 2010, Mike Love contributed to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's \"More Hope For The Holidays\" album with vocals on \"Closing of the Year\" as well as contributing his self-penned \"Santa's Goin' To Kokomo\". On the album he appears alongside Weezer, Brandi Carlile, and Creedence Clearwater Revisited. Proceeds benefit the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. He performed a benefit concert for the foundation for the Children of the Californias which raised one million dollars to support the expansion of three new surgical suites. During the 50th Reunion Tour Love alongside the Beach Boys partnered with Operation Smile to raise funds for those in need of cleft lip and palate repair surgeries. In May 2013, Love was recognised for his decades of investment in education and national service by being awarded City Year's \"Seven Generations Award\".\n\n\nStudio albums\n\nWith Celebration\n\nOther albums\n\nSingles\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "44212899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44212899", "title": "Nader's Dagestan campaign", "text": "Nader's Dagestan campaign\n\nNader's Dagestan campaign, refers to the campaigns conducted by the Persian Empire (under the Safavid and Afsharid dynasty) under the ruling king Nader Shah between the years 1741 and 1743 in order to fully subjugate the Dagestan region in the North Caucasus Area. The conflict between the Persian Empire & the Lezgins and a myriad of other Caucasian tribes in the north was intermittently fought through the mid-1730s during Nader's first short expedition in the Caucasus until the very last years of his reign and assassination in 1747 with minor skirmishes and raids. The incredibly difficult terrain of the northern Caucasus region made the task of subduing the Lezgins an extremely challenging one. Despite this Nader Shah gained numerous strongholds and fortresses from the Dagestan people and pushed them to the very verge of defeat. The Lezgins however held on in the northernmost reaches of Dagestan and continued to defy Persian domination.\n\nThe conflict was fought over many years and only included a few years of actual hard fighting, usually when Nader himself was present, but otherwise consisted of skirmishes and raids throughout. The majority of the Persian casualties were from the extremity of the weather as well as the outbreak of disease, all of which combined with the indomitable will of the Lezgins to wage an insurgency and retreat to their distant strongholds when threatened with a pitched battle made the entire war a quagmire for Nader's forces. Ultimately the Lezgins who had held on in the northern fortresses marched south upon hearing of Nader's assassination and reclaimed most of their lost territories as the Persian empire crumbled.\n\nIn 1741, an attempt was made on Nāder’s life near Darband. When the would-be assassin claimed that he had been recruited by Reza Qoli, the shah had his son blinded in retaliation, an act for which he later felt great remorse. Marvi reported that Nāder began to manifest signs of physical deterioration and mental instability. Finally, the shah was forced to reinstate taxes due to insufficient funds, and the heavy levies sparked numerous rebellions.\n\nAfter Nader's successful campaign in 1735 against the Ottomans, he lingered on appointing new governors to his newly acquired cities and kingdoms before setting out against the Lezgians in northern Daghestan. The Tatars who had marched all the way from Crimea, on receiving news of Koprulu Pasha's demise at the Battle of Yeghevārd, turned and hastened back north along the black sea coast. The Lezgians however were determined to fight, especially with the advent of the winter snow in the tight restricted mountain passes of northern Daghestan. The Lezgian leader suffered a crippling defeat in June 1736 and fled to the Avars with many of his subjects making peace with Nader.\n\nIn 1739, during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire, his brother, Ebrahim Khan Afshar, launched a campaign to subdue the Lezgins in Dagestan. Events initially unfolded very favourably, with the Lezgins being defeated decisively in a pitched battle. However, Ebrahim Khan and a small group of his retainers were ambushed when they were passing through a valley. The Lezgins killed Ebrahim Khan and desecrated his corpse.\n\nNader recruited for the occasion 100,000-150,000 soldiers from all parts of Iran, but also Tatars and Uzbeks. Many Dagestan tribes came south to Nader's camp to submit and pay tribute, though others prepared for resistance. The prominent Georgian nobleman Givi Amilakhvari, who was appointed as a governor (\"wakil\") of Kartli for the shah of Iran and reconfirmed as Prince of Saamilakhoro and Duke (\"eristavi\") of Ksani in the same year of 1741, took part in the campaign. Nader first sent 10,000 mounted Tofangchi led by Mir Alam Khan Khazime, Esmail Beig Minbâshi and Zaman Beig Minbâshi Mashhadi to subdue the Lezgins. However, they failed to defeat the 30,000 Lezgin warriors, most of whom were musketeers, and were driven back. Nader then ordered Rahim Khan Uzbek and his troop composed between 10,000 and 11,000 Tofangchi from different tribes to reinforce the engaged Persian troops. Together, they devastated the Lezgin army, killing 5,000 men. The rest of Lezgins took refuge in the mountains.\n\nNader eventually reached the last fortress of the Lezgins in northern Dagestan and laid siege to it. But because of the early arrival of winter and outbreak of disease as well as the difficult logistical situation Nader chose to withdraw. This could also have been due to Nader's deteriorating health which made the climate more insufferable. Nader's columns was constantly harassed on their way south and Nader could not bring the Lezgins to commit in a set piece battle despite trying to do so numerous times. The Persian army suffered great casualties and many of the tribes which had initially submitted to Persian suzerainty rebelled again. It was during this campaign that an attempted assassination of Nader Shah failed. Suspecting his eldest son, Mirza Rezâ gholi, took out his eyes.\n\nAfter negotiations had broken down with the Istanbul, Nader declared war against the Ottomans and invaded Mesopotamia again. However, because of the lengthy siege of Mosul and numerous rebellions throughout the interior of Persia the campaign was indecisive and Nader withdrew after coming to terms with the Ottoman negotiators. Later he launched another campaign in Dagestan. The tribes refused to be drawn into any set piece battles as they again took to the hills and forests in the mountainous terrain of the north Caucasus. Nader's invasion made even less progress this time around and no conclusive result came of this last expedition in Dagestan. This expedition was notorious for its bloodthirsty nature with many villages and towns razed to the ground and their inhabitants slain or enslaved.\n\nNader Shah's ultimately failed attempts at annexing Dagestan became a source for legends, myths and folk-tales amongst the people of the north Caucasus. The Avar epic \"Srazhenie s Nadir Shakhom\", (The battle with Nāder Shah), and the \"Lak Pesnya o geroe Murtazaali\", (Epic of the hero Mortażā ʿAlī), provide a vivid and colourful picture of the triumph over “the scourge of the universe.” These works represent the pinnacle of the Dāḡestānī epic genre; their significance to the mountain peoples “can be compared to that of \"Slovo o polku Igoreve\" (The lay of the army of Igor) in Russian epic poetry”.\n\n\n"}

Edgington told police that she was abused by her father when younger. She shoplifted during her adolescence and used violence against her brother and mother since childhood. She had stays in care homes at times. She worked as a hairdresser, shop assistant and saleswoman. According to the \"Daily Mail\", she has been a prostitute, pole dancer and drug dealer. At age 17, Nicola miscarried twins after being punched in the stomach by a violent boyfriend and at 19 she was pregnant again, by a drug-dealer boyfriend, and gave birth to a son three months prematurely. Nicola's mother Marion helped her care for the baby, until giving the boy to foster care. Edgington married a Jamaican man who is the father of her younger son. The sons were taken into care and then to Jamaica by her former husband.\n\nOn 4 November 2005, Edgington stabbed her 60-year-old mother, Marion, nine times in Forest Row, East Sussex for which she was convicted of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility (based on diagnoses of schizophrenia and emotionally unstable personality traits) at Lewes Crown Court on 23 October 2006. She was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act 1983 and, following treatment and psychiatric evaluation, was released conditionally in September 2009, moving into a Greenwich flat.\n\nIn September 2011, Edgington sent a message via Facebook to her brother saying she was not getting the help she needed, missed her mother, and had had a miscarriage. She left her phone number and asked him not to tell their father, Harry, that she had made contact. Her brother replied that she killed their mother and he found the body, that the miscarriage was good news, and that she should kill herself by cutting her wrists.\n\nEdgington sought help from the controversial Universal Church of the Kingdom of God prior to the attacks, as she had prior to the killing of her mother, which may have disturbed her further.\n\nOn 6, 7 and 9 October, Edgington contacted police several times by phone and once in person reporting that individuals were making death threats against her (naming one individual), and later that two cocaine users were refusing to leave her flat and may have stolen from her. Despite initially being graded as serious and requiring police attendance, no police were dispatched to investigate.\n\nOn the morning of 10 October 2011, Edgington pleaded numerous times with police and local mental health services to physically detain her under their legal powers as she felt she was having another psychotic breakdown, saying she had killed someone before and that the more scared she became the more dangerous she could be. Although taken to Queen Elizabeth hospital, she was left there by police prior to being securely admitted, and the psychiatric staff decided they were only going to admit her on a voluntary basis despite her risk profile and secure care plan being in her psychiatric file. \n\nLater in the morning of 10 October 2011, while waiting for staff to change shift and admit her, Edgington left the hospital through a door that should have been locked, took two buses, and stabbed two strangers in the street in separate attacks in Bexleyheath. She bought a knife from Asda with which she tried to kill 22-year-old Kerry Clark, who survived and a member of the public took the knife off her. Edgington subsequently stole a knife from a butcher's shop and stabbed and beheaded 58-year-old Sally Hodkin, who died of her injuries within minutes. Edgington was arrested later the same morning.\n\nAccording to psychiatrists, Edgington was suffering from paranoid delusions and hallucinations, with a religious subtext. She believed a 100-eyed monster was guarding the throne of God against enemies, and saw shops looking like a nuclear holocaust had taken place; she believed Jesus had come back to save everyone's souls except hers which she couldn't understand as she loved God. She also felt she was in a computer simulation and had various bizarre beliefs relating to famous figures and films. \n\nOn 7 February 2013 at the Old Bailey, Edgington was convicted by jury of the attempted murder of Clark and of the murder of Hodkin. Judge Brian Barker jailed her for life on 4 March 2013, with a minimum tariff of 37 years. Barker wrote that despite Edgington's firm long-standing diagnosis of schizophrenia and probable psychosis around the time of the attacks, he believed the over-riding factor was borderline personality disorder (in the UK usually referred to in ICD terms as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Borderline Type) with rational ability. He referred to a recent medical report indicating no need for hospital treatment for Edgington. Despite Edgington having sought multiple times to have herself detained by the police or medical services prior to her actions, Barker stated that the killing was premeditated in a way that showed a \"consistent and calculated course of criminal conduct\". Barker included the random and unprovoked nature of the attacks as aggravating factors indicating more guilt, while disregarding the mitigating factor of mental disability since the psychiatric authorities disagreed about it.\n"}

{"id": "305091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305091", "title": "Peter Sutcliffe", "text": "Peter Sutcliffe\n\nPeter William Coonan (born Peter William Sutcliffe; 2 June 1946) is an English serial killer who was dubbed the \"Yorkshire Ripper\" by the press. In 1981, Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others.\n\nSutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford. When interviewed by authorities, he claimed that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes. Sutcliffe carried out his murder spree over five years, during which time the public were especially shocked by the murders of women who were not prostitutes. After his arrest for driving with false number plates in January 1981, the police questioned him about the killings and he confessed to being the perpetrator.\n\nAt his trial in 1981, he pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of diminished responsibility after a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia but his defence was rejected by a majority of the jury. He is serving 20 concurrent sentences of life imprisonment. Following his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother's maiden name and became known as Peter William Coonan.\n\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for the time taken in apprehending Sutcliffe despite interviewing him nine times during the murder hunt. Because of the sensational nature of the case, the police handled an exceptional amount of information, some of it misleading (including a hoax recorded message and letters purporting to be from the \"Ripper\"). The 1982 Byford Report of the official inquiry (made public in 2006) confirmed the validity of the criticism.\n\nThe High Court dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a whole life order and never be released from custody. He was transferred from prison to a high-security psychiatric hospital in March 1984. In August 2016, it was ruled that Sutcliffe was mentally fit to be returned to prison, and was transferred that month to HM Prison Frankland in Durham.\n\nSutcliffe was born in Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire to a working-class family. He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (née Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. He left this position when he was asked to go on the road as a salesman.\n\nAfter leaving Baird Television, he worked nightshifts at the Britannia Works of Anderton International from April 1973. In February 1975, he took redundancy and used half of the £400 pay-off to train as a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver. On 5 March 1976, he was dismissed for the theft of used tyres. He was unemployed until October 1976, when he found a job as an HGV driver for T.& W.H. Clark (Holdings) Ltd. on the Canal Road Industrial Estate in Bradford.\n\nSutcliffe, by some reports, used prostitutes as a young man, and it has been speculated that he had a bad experience during which he was conned out of money. Other analyses of his actions have not found evidence that he actually sought their services although he clearly expressed unusual behaviour before the killings.\n\nHe met Sonia Szurma on 14 February 1967; they married on 10 August 1974. She suffered several miscarriages and they were informed that she would not be able to have children. She resumed a teacher training course, during which time she had an affair with an ice-cream van driver. When she completed the course in 1977 and began teaching, she and Sutcliffe used her salary to buy a house in Heaton, Bradford, which they moved into on 26 September 1977, and where they lived at the time of Sutcliffe's arrest.\n\nThrough his childhood and his early adolescence, Sutcliffe showed no signs of abnormality. Later, in part related to his occupation as a gravedigger, he developed an unhealthy, macabre sense of humour. In his late adolescence, he developed a growing obsession with voyeurism and spent much time spying on prostitutes and the men seeking their services.\n\nSutcliffe assaulted a prostitute he had met while searching for a woman who had tricked him out of money. He left his friend Trevor Birdsall's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, as if he had been running. He told Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, \"I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. I went back to the car and got in it\".\n\nPolice visited his home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall's vehicle registration plate. Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand. The police told him he was \"very lucky\" as the woman did not want anything more to do with the incident – she was a known prostitute, and her husband was serving a jail term for assault.\n\nSutcliffe committed his second assault on the night of 5 July 1975 in Keighley. He attacked Anna Rogulskyj, who was walking alone, striking her unconscious with a ball-peen hammer and slashing her stomach with a knife. Disturbed by a neighbour, he left without killing her. Rogulskyj survived after extensive medical intervention but was psychologically traumatised by the attack.\n\nSutcliffe attacked Olive Smelt in Halifax in August. Employing the same \"modus operandi\", he struck her from behind and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered emotional scars, including clinical depression. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran off when he saw the lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.\n\nThe first victim to lose her life in a Sutcliffe attack was Wilma McCann on 30 October. McCann, from Chapeltown in Leeds, was a mother of four. Sutcliffe struck her twice with a hammer before stabbing her 15 times in the neck, chest and abdomen. An extensive inquiry, involving 150 police officers and 11,000 interviews, failed to find the culprit. One of McCann's daughters died by suicide in December 2007, reportedly after suffering years of depression over her mother's death.\n\nSutcliffe committed his next murder in Leeds in January 1976, when he stabbed 42-year-old Emily Jackson 52 times. In dire financial straits, Jackson had been using the family van to exchange sexual favours for money. Sutcliffe picked up Jackson who was soliciting outside the Gaiety pub on Roundhay Road, he then drove about half a mile to some derelict buildings on Enfield Terrace in the Manor Industrial Estate. Sutcliffe hit her on the head with a hammer, and then dragged her body into a rubbish strewn yard and used a sharpened screwdriver to stab her in the neck, chest and abdomen. Sutcliffe stamped on her thigh, leaving behind an impression of his boot.\n\nSutcliffe attacked 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in Roundhay Park, Leeds, on 9 May. Walking home from a party, she accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When she got out of the car to urinate, Sutcliffe hit her from behind with a hammer. She was left alive and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At the time of this attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant, and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.\n\nOn 5 February Sutcliffe attacked Irene Richardson, a Chapeltown prostitute, in Roundhay Park. Richardson was bludgeoned to death with a hammer. Once she was dead, he mutilated her corpse with a knife. Tyre tracks left near the murder scene resulted in a long list of possible suspect vehicles.\n\nTwo months later, on 23 April, Sutcliffe killed Patricia \"Tina\" Atkinson, a prostitute from Bradford, in her flat, where police found a bootprint on the bedclothes. Two months later on 26 June, he murdered 16-year-old Jayne MacDonald in Chapeltown. She was not a prostitute and, in the public perception, showed that all women were potential victims. Sutcliffe seriously assaulted Maureen Long in Bradford in July. He was interrupted and left her for dead. A witness misidentified the make of his car. More than 300 police officers collected 12,500 statements and checked thousands of cars, without success. On 1 October 1977 Sutcliffe murdered Jean Jordan, a prostitute from Manchester. Her body was found 10 days later and had been moved several days after her death. In a confession, Sutcliffe said he had realised the new £5 note he had given her was traceable. After hosting a family party at his new home, he returned to the wasteland behind Manchester's Southern Cemetery, where he had left the body, to retrieve the note. Unable to find it, he mutilated Jordan's corpse and moved it.\n\nThe following morning, Jordan's body was discovered by a local dairy worker, Bruce Jones, who had an allotment on land adjoining the site where the body was found and was searching for house bricks when he made the discovery. The £5 note, hidden in a secret compartment in Jordan's handbag, was traced to branches of the Midland Bank in Shipley and Bingley. Police analysis of bank operations allowed them to narrow their field of inquiry to 8,000 employees who could have received it in their wage packet. Over three months the police interviewed 5,000 men, including Sutcliffe. The police found that the alibi given for Sutcliffe's whereabouts was credible; he had indeed spent much of the evening of the killing at a family party. Weeks of intense investigations pertaining to the origins of the £5 note led to nothing, leaving police officers frustrated that they collected an important clue, but had been unable to trace the actual firm (or employee within the firm) to which the note had been issued.\n\nOn 14 December, Sutcliffe attacked Marilyn Moore, another prostitute from Leeds. She survived and provided police with a description of her attacker. Tyre tracks found at the scene matched those from an earlier attack.\n\nThe police discontinued the search for the person who received the £5 note in January 1978. Although Sutcliffe was interviewed about it, he was not investigated further (he was contacted and disregarded by the Ripper Squad on several further occasions). That month, Sutcliffe killed again. His victim was Yvonne Pearson, a 21-year-old prostitute from Bradford. He repeatedly bludgeoned her about the head with a ball-pein hammer then jumped on her chest before stuffing horse-hair into her mouth from a discarded sofa under which he hid her body near Lumb Lane. Her body was not found until 26 March.\n\nTen days later, he killed Helen Rytka, an 18-year-old prostitute from Huddersfield. He struck Rytka on the head five times as she exited his vehicle, before stripping many of her clothes from her body (although her bra and polo-neck jumper were positioned above her breasts), before repeatedly stabbing her in the chest. Her body was found beneath railway arches in the timber-yard to which he had driven her three days later.\n\nOn 16 May, Sutcliffe killed Vera Millward in an attack in the car park of Manchester Royal Infirmary.\n\nOn 4 April 1979, Sutcliffe killed Josephine Whitaker, a 19-year-old building society clerk whom he attacked on Saville Park Moor in Halifax as she was walking home. Despite forensic evidence, police efforts were diverted for several months following receipt of a taped message purporting to be from the murderer taunting Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield, who was leading the investigation. The tape contained a man's voice saying \"I'm Jack. I see you're having no luck catching me. I have the greatest respect for you, George, but Lord, you're no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started.\"\n\nBased on the recorded message, police began searching for a man with a Wearside accent, which linguists narrowed down to the Castletown area of Sunderland. The hoaxer, dubbed \"Wearside Jack\", sent two letters to police and \"The Daily Mirror\" in March 1978 boasting of his crimes. The letters, signed \"Jack the Ripper\", claimed responsibility for the murder of 26-year-old Joan Harrison in Preston in November 1975. At the time, police mistakenly believed that the Preston murder was not public knowledge.\n\nOn 1 September, Sutcliffe murdered 20-year-old Barbara Leach, a Bradford University student. Her body was dumped at the rear of 13 Ashgrove under a pile of bricks, close to the university and her lodgings. It was his 16th attack. The murder of a woman who was not a prostitute again alarmed the public and prompted an expensive publicity campaign emphasising the Wearside connection. Despite the false lead, Sutcliffe was interviewed on at least two other occasions in 1979. Despite matching several forensic clues and being on the list of 300 names in connection with the £5 note, he was not strongly suspected. Sutcliffe was interviewed by police nine times.\n\nIn April 1980 Sutcliffe was arrested for drunk-driving. While awaiting trial, he killed two more women. He murdered 47-year-old Marguerite Walls on the night of 20 August, and 20-year-old Jacqueline Hill, a student at Leeds University, on the night of 17 November. Hill's body was found in the grounds of the Lupton Residences. He attacked three other women who survived; Dr Uphadya Bandara in Leeds on 24 September, Maureen Lea (known as Mo), an art student attacked in the grounds of Leeds University on 25 October and 16-year-old Theresa Sykes, attacked in Huddersfield on the night of 5 November. On 25 November Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe, reported him to the police as a suspect but the information vanished into the paperwork already accumulated.\n\nOn 2 January 1981, Sutcliffe was stopped by the police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers in the driveway of Light Trades House in Melbourne Avenue, Broomhill, Sheffield. A police check by probationary constable Robert Hydes revealed his car had false number plates and Sutcliffe was arrested and transferred to Dewsbury Police Station. At Dewsbury he was questioned in relation to the Yorkshire Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics. The next day police returned to the scene of the arrest and discovered a knife, hammer and rope he had discarded when he briefly slipped away from the police after telling them he was \"bursting for a pee\". Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at the police station when he was permitted to use the toilet. The police obtained a search warrant for his home at 6 Garden Lane in Heaton, Bradford and brought his wife in for questioning.\n\nWhen Sutcliffe was stripped at the police station he was wearing an inverted V-neck sweater under his trousers. The sleeves had been pulled over his legs and the V-neck exposed his genital area. The front of the elbows were padded to protect his knees as, presumably, he knelt over his victims' corpses. The sexual implications of this outfit were considered obvious, but it was not made public until the 2003 book, \"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper\", by Michael Bilton was published. After two days of intensive questioning, on the afternoon of 4 January 1981 Sutcliffe suddenly declared he was the Ripper. Over the next day, Sutcliffe calmly described his many attacks. Weeks later he claimed God had told him to murder the women. He displayed emotion only when telling of the killing of his youngest victim, Jayne MacDonald, and when questioned about the murder of Joan Harrison, which he vehemently denied committing. Harrison's murder had been linked to the Ripper killings by the \"Wearside Jack\" claim, and in 2011, DNA evidence proved it had been committed by convicted sex offender Christopher Smith, who had died in 2008.\n\nSutcliffe was charged at Dewsbury on 5 January. At his trial, he pleaded not guilty to 13 charges of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The basis of his defence was he claimed to be the tool of God's will. Sutcliffe claimed to have heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger. He said the voices originated from a headstone of a Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski, and that the voices were that of God.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to seven charges of attempted murder. The prosecution intended to accept Sutcliffe's plea after four psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia but the trial judge, Mr Justice Boreham, demanded an unusually detailed explanation of the prosecution reasoning. After a two-hour representation by the Attorney-General Sir Michael Havers, a 90-minute lunch break and another 40 minutes of legal discussion, the judge rejected the diminished responsibility plea and the expert testimonies of the psychiatrists, insisting that the case should be dealt with by a jury. The trial proper was set to commence on 5 May 1981.\n\nThe trial lasted two weeks and despite the efforts of his counsel James Chadwin QC, Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all counts and was sentenced to 20 concurrent sentences of life imprisonment. The trial judge said Sutcliffe was beyond redemption, and hoped he would never leave prison. He recommended a minimum term of 30 years to be served before parole could be considered meaning Sutcliffe would have been unlikely to be freed until at least 2011. On 16 July 2010, the High Court issued Sutcliffe with a whole life tariff, meaning he is unlikely ever to be released. The whole life tariff was introduced by the government in 1983, and over the next 20 years it was reported that Sutcliffe was among the small group of prisoners to have been issued with a whole life tariff. Politicians were stripped of their powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners in November 2002, and the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner can serve has since rested with the High Court.\n\nAfter his trial, Sutcliffe admitted two other attacks. It was decided that prosecution for these offences was \"not in the public interest\". West Yorkshire Police made it clear that the victims wished to remain anonymous.\n\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. The 1982 Byford report into the investigation concluded 'The ineffectiveness of the major incident room was a serious handicap to the Ripper investigation. While it should have been the effective nerve centre of the whole police operation, the backlog of unprocessed information resulted in the failure to connect vital pieces of related information. This serious fault in the central index system allowed Peter Sutcliffe to continually slip through the net'.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \"Wearside Jack\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \"Wearside Jack\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.\n\nIn response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.\n\nIn 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in \"Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire\". The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the \"Caparo\" test.\n\nThe Inspector of Constabulary Sir Lawrence Byford's 1981 report of an official inquiry into the Ripper case was not released by the Home Office until 1 June 2006. The sections \"Description of suspects, photofits and other assaults\" and parts of the section on Sutcliffe's \"immediate associates\" were not disclosed by the Home Office.\n\nReferring to the period between 1969, when Sutcliffe first came to the attention of police, and 1975, the year of the murder of Wilma McCann, the report states: \"There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities\" and \"it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas but also in other parts of the country\". In 1969 Sutcliffe, described in the Byford Report as an \"otherwise unremarkable young man\", came to the notice of police on two occasions over incidents with prostitutes. Later that year, in September, he was also arrested in Bradford's red light district for being in possession of a hammer, an offensive weapon, but he was charged with \"going equipped for stealing\" as it was assumed he was a potential burglar. The report said that it was clear he had on at least one occasion attacked a Bradford prostitute with a cosh.\n\nByford's report states:\n\nPolice identified a number of attacks which matched Sutcliffe's modus operandi and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes.\n\nThe Byford Report's major findings were contained in a summary published by the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, the first time precise details of the bungled police investigation had been disclosed. Sir Lawrence described delays in following up vital tip-offs from Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe since 1966. On 25 November 1980, Birdsall sent an anonymous letter to police, the text of which ran as follows:\n\nThis letter was marked \"Priority No 1\". An index card was created on the basis of the letter and a policewoman found Sutcliffe already had three existing index cards in the records. But \"for some inexplicable reason\", said the Byford Report, the papers remained in a filing tray in the incident room until the murderer's arrest on 2 January the following year.\n\nBirdsall visited Bradford Police Station the day after sending the letter to repeat his misgivings about Sutcliffe. He added that he was with Sutcliffe when he got out of a car to pursue a woman with whom he had had a bar room dispute in Halifax on 16 August 1975. This was the date and place of the Olive Smelt attack. A report compiled on the visit was lost, despite a \"comprehensive search\" which took place after Sutcliffe's arrest, according to the report. Byford said:\n\nFollowing his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name. He began his sentence at HMP Parkhurst on 22 May 1981. Despite being found sane at his trial, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Attempts to send him to a secure psychiatric unit were blocked. While at Parkhurst he was seriously assaulted by James Costello, a 35-year-old career criminal with several convictions for violence. On 10 January 1983, he followed Sutcliffe into the recess of F2, the hospital wing at Parkhurst Prison and plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe's face, creating four wounds requiring 30 stitches. In March 1984 Sutcliffe was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983.\n\nHis wife obtained a separation from him in 1982 and a divorce in April 1994. On 23 February 1996, Sutcliffe was attacked in his room in Broadmoor Hospital's Henley Ward. Paul Wilson, a convicted robber, asked to borrow a videotape before attempting to strangle him with the cable from a pair of stereo headphones. Two other convicted murderers, Kenneth Erskine and Jamie Devitt, intervened on hearing screams.\n\nAfter an attack with a pen by fellow inmate Ian Kay on 10 March 1997, Sutcliffe lost the vision in his left eye, and his right eye was severely damaged. Kay admitted trying to kill Sutcliffe, and was ordered to be detained in a secure mental hospital without limit of time.\n\nIn 2003 it was reported that Sutcliffe had developed diabetes.\n\nSutcliffe's father died in 2004 and was cremated. On 17 January 2005 Sutcliffe was allowed to visit Grange-over-Sands where the ashes had been scattered. The decision to allow the temporary release was initiated by David Blunkett and ratified by Charles Clarke when he became Home Secretary. Sutcliffe was accompanied by four members of the hospital staff. Despite the passage of 25 years since the Ripper murders, Sutcliffe's visit was the focus of front-page tabloid headlines.\n\nOn 22 December 2007, Sutcliffe was attacked by fellow inmate Patrick Sureda, who lunged at him with a metal cutlery knife while shouting \"You fucking raping, murdering bastard, I'll blind your fucking other one\". Sutcliffe flung himself backwards and the blade missed his right eye, stabbing him in the cheek.\n\nOn 17 February 2009, it was reported that Sutcliffe was \"fit to leave Broadmoor\". On 23 March 2010, the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, was questioned by Julie Kirkbride, Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, in the House of Commons seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe's release was a parole board matter, \"that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released\".\n\nAn application by Sutcliffe for a minimum term to be set, offering the possibility of parole after that date if it is thought safe to release him, was heard by the High Court of Justice on 16 July 2010. The High Court decided that Sutcliffe will never be released. Mr Justice Mitting stated:\n\nPsychological Reports describing his mental state were taken into consideration, as was the severity of his crimes. Barring judicial decisions to the contrary, Sutcliffe will spend the rest of his life in Broadmoor Hospital. On 4 August 2010, a spokeswoman for the Judicial Communications Office confirmed that Sutcliffe had initiated an appeal against the decision.\n\nThe hearing for Sutcliffe's appeal against the ruling began on 30 November 2010 at the Court of Appeal. It was rejected on 14 January 2011. On 9 March 2011, the Court of Appeal rejected Sutcliffe's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn December 2015 Sutcliffe was assessed as being \"no longer mentally ill\". In August 2016, a medical tribunal ruled that he no longer required clinical treatment for his mental condition, and could be returned to prison. Sutcliffe is reported to have been transferred from Broadmoor to Frankland Prison in Durham in August 2016.\n\nOn 26 August 2016 the police investigation was the subject of BBC Radio 4's \"The Reunion\". Sue MacGregor discussed the investigation with John Domaille, who later became assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire Police; Andy Laptew, who was a junior detective who interviewed Sutcliffe; Elaine Benson, who worked in the incident room and interviewed suspects; David Zackrisson, who investigated the \"Wearside Jack\" tape and letters in Sunderland and Christa Ackroyd, a local journalist in Halifax.\n\nIn 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Painthall to determine if Sutcliffe was guilty of unsolved crimes dating back to 1964. This inquiry also looked at the killings of two sex workers in southern Sweden in 1980. As Sutcliffe was a lorry driver, it was theorised that he had been in Denmark and Sweden, making use of the ferry across the Oresund Strait. West Yorkshire Police later stated that they were \"absolutely certain\" that Sutcliffe had never been in Sweden.\n\n\n"}

He then spent some time in Japan working for the W*ING promotion as Goliath El Gigante. He was signed to the WWF in 1997, alongside The Jackyl, as a member of The Truth Commission. He was billed as The Interrogator. The group was sent to the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) before being called up to the main WWF roster, where Maillet's ring name evolved into Kurrgan The Interrogator (whose name was inspired by The Kurgan, and was occasionally referred to as The Kurrgan on television). Under the tutelage of The Jackyl, a charismatic cult leader, Kurrgan was a heel known for applying the Iron Claw to his opponents and not breaking the hold until The Jackyl slapped him across the face.\n\nAfter The Truth Commission disbanded, Maillet (now billed simply as Kurrgan) continued as a singles wrestler managed by The Jackyl. He later went on to be part of The Oddities, The Jackyl's new stable; however, once The Jackyl was removed as the advisor of The Oddities and replaced by the Insane Clown Posse, The Oddities turned face and became fan favourites.
