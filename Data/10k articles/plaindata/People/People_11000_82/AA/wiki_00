He was former Director of the Office of Political Reform of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Policy Secretary of Zhao Ziyang, Chinese Premier from 1980 to 1987 and CPC General Secretary from 1987 to 1989. He was also Director of the Drafting Committee for the CPC 13th Party Congresses, known for its strong support for market reform and opening up under Deng Xiaoping. Prior to this, he was a committee member and then Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform.\n\nBao was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province, but grew up in Shanghai. He currently lives in Beijing with his wife Jiang Zongcao, his daughter Bao Jian, and granddaughter Bao Yangyang. His son, Bao Pu, lives abroad.\n\nBao was Director of the Office of Political Reform of the CPC Central Committee and the Policy Secretary of Zhao Ziyang, Chinese Premier from 1980 to 1987 and CPC General Secretary from 1987 to 1989. He was also Director of the Drafting Committee for the CPC 13th Party Congresses, prior to which he was a committee member and then Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform.\n\nOn May 28, 1989, he was arrested in Beijing just before the crushing of the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Zhao Ziyang had resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in protest when Deng Xiaoping made the decision to crack down on the students. Bao Tong was a close associate of Zhao and the writer of his speeches and editorials supporting a democratic and legal approach to the student movement. Zhao was held under house arrest for the rest of his life, while Bao Tong was officially charged with \"revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing\", the highest government official to be charged in relation to the 1989 movement. He was publicly convicted in 1992 in a brief show trial and sentenced to 7 seven years' imprisonment with 2 years deprivation of political rights. He served his full sentence in isolation at Qincheng Prison.\n\nOn May 27, 1996, when he was due to be released upon completing his prison sentence, he was instead held at a government compound in Xishan (outside Beijing) for an additional year, until his family agreed to move out of their apartment in town to one allocated for them by the authorities, where a 24-hour guarded gate and surveillance cameras were installed. Visitors were screened, the phone was tapped or cut off entirely, and Bao Tong was followed by an entourage of men the moment he stepped out of his home. Though he has moved to another apartment in Beijing, the system of surveillance and curtailing his phone calls, visitors and movements has followed him to his new home.\n\nBao Tong appealed for the restoration of civil and political rights of Zhao Ziyang from 1998 until Zhao's death. He was instrumental to the publication in May 2009 of Zhao Ziyang's memoir, based on audiotapes that Zhao made secretly while under house arrest and discovered after his death in 2005. Bao Tong's son Bao Pu, and daughter-in-law Renee Chiang, published the book \"Journey of Reform\" () in Hong Kong and translated and edited (along with Adi Ignatius) an English version of this book entitled . Bao Tong wrote an introduction for the Chinese version.\n\nBao Tong continues to write articles openly critical of the government and its policies. He supports further democratic development in Hong Kong and continues to voice the need for political reform in China. He was a signer of the Charter 08 manifesto and calls for the release of Liu Xiaobo, an organiser of the charter who was arrested in December 2008.\n\nOn January 19, 2005, the Washington Post reported that Bao Tong and his wife were injured in attacks by more than 20 plainclothes security agents as they attempted to leave their home to pay their respect to the family of Zhao Ziyang, who died on January 17. The authorities would only allow him access to a doctor if he removed a white flower pinned to his vest. He refused. (\"Note that the white flower is a traditional symbol of mourning\") His wife, pushed to the ground by a policeman, fractured a bone in her spine that had her hospitalized for 3 months.\n\nOn January 1, 2007, Reuters tested a new government relaxing of regulations on foreign reporters by visiting Bao Tong at his home, purportedly to conduct an interview about the Beijing Olympics. Since then, several foreign reporters have done the same. The guards sometimes attempt to intimidate or deny visitation, but are apparently allowing most foreign reporters to enter, if prior arrangements are made. Local Chinese reporters are not included in this new relaxation of regulations.\nSky News reporter Peter Sharp describes his visit to Bao Tong in his blog.\n\nTheir home telephone continues to be tapped and periodically cut off, especially when overseas callers ask to speak to Bao Tong. He is followed everywhere he goes, and is occasionally blocked from “sensitive” events or places, for example, the home of Zhao Ziyang while he was alive, and his funeral after his death in 2005. Bao has been allowed to leave Beijing on three occasions since his arrest in 1989, the last time in 2009 for a holiday by invitation and escort of the Public Security from May 22 to June 7, neatly avoiding the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. Visits from his son, Bao Pu, a resident of Hong Kong, are permitted by special arrangements only; under normal circumstances of application, he is unable to obtain a visa.\n\n\n"}

His books include \"War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning\" (2002), a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction; \"Empire of Illusion: The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle\" (2009); \"Death of the Liberal Class\" (2010); \"Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt\" (2012), written with cartoonist Joe Sacco, which was a \"New York Times\" best-seller; \"Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt\" (2015); and his most recent \"America: The Farewell Tour\" (2018).\n\nHedges is a columnist for the progressive news and commentary website Truthdig. He is also a host for the television program \"On Contact\" on RT. Hedges spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in Central America, West Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Balkans. He has reported from more than fifty countries, and has worked for \"The Christian Science Monitor\", NPR, \"Dallas Morning News\", and \"The New York Times\", where he was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years (1990–2005).\n\nIn 2001, Hedges contributed to \"The New York Times\" staff entry that received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for the paper's coverage of global terrorism. He also received the Amnesty International Global Award for Human Rights Journalism in 2002. He has taught at Columbia University, New York University, the University of Toronto and Princeton University, where he is a visiting lecturer in African American studies.\n\nHedges has taught college credit courses for several years in New Jersey prisons. He teaches a course through Princeton University in which the class is composed of half prisoners and half Princeton undergraduates. He has described himself as a socialist and more specifically as a Christian anarchist, identifying with Catholic activist Dorothy Day in particular.\n\nChristopher Lynn Hedges was born in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, the son of Thelma Louise (\"née\" Prince) and the Rev. Thomas Havard Hedges, a Presbyterian minister. He grew up in rural Schoharie County, New York, southwest of Albany. He graduated in 1975 from the Loomis Chaffee School, a private boarding school in Windsor, Connecticut. He founded an underground newspaper at the school that was banned by the administration and resulted in his being put on probation.\n\nHedges received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Colgate University in 1979. He received a Master of Divinity degree from Harvard Divinity School (where he studied under James Luther Adams) in 1983. He speaks English, Arabic, French, and Spanish, and studied Latin and Classical Greek at Harvard.\n\nHedges worked for 15 years as a foreign correspondent for \"The New York Times\". He was based in the Middle East for five years, serving for four of those years as the Middle East bureau chief. He covered the war in the former Yugoslavia as the Balkan bureau chief based in Sarajevo. He later covered Al Qaeda in Europe and the Middle East from Paris.\n\nThree of Hedges' articles were based upon the stories of Iraqi defectors, who had been furnished to Hedges by the Information Collection Program of the U.S.-funded Iraqi National Congress. The program promoted stories to major media outlets in order to orchestrate U.S. intervention in Iraq in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Most significant of his reports in this period was a November 8, 2001, front-page story about two former Iraqi military commanders who claimed to have trained foreign mujahedeen how to hijack planes without using guns. Hedges quoted a man whom he believed to be an Iraqi general: \"These Islamic radicals ... came from a variety of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. We were training these people to attack installations important to the United States\". The two defectors also asserted there was a secret compound in Salman Pak facility where a German scientist was producing biological weapons.\n\nAccording to \"Mother Jones\": \"The impact of the article ... was immediate: Op-eds ran in major papers, and the story was taken to a wider audience through cable-TV talk shows. When Condoleezza Rice, then George W. Bush's national security adviser, was asked about the report at a press briefing, she said, 'I think it surprises no one that Saddam Hussein is engaged in all kinds of activities that are destabilizing. As late as 2006, conservative magazines including \"The Weekly Standard\" and \"National Review\" continued to use this article to justify the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIt later was revealed that the story which Hedges reported was \"an elaborate scam\". The defector whom Hedges quoted, who had identified himself as Lt. General Jamal al-Ghurairy, was a former sergeant. The real Ghurairy had never left Iraq. Hedges said that he had taken on reporting this account at the request of Lowell Bergman of \"Frontline\", who wanted the defectors for his show but could not go to Beirut for the interview. The trip had been organized by Ahmed Chalabi, whom Hedges considered to be unreliable. Hedges said he had done the piece as a favor to Bergman, explaining, \"There has to be a level of trust between reporters. We cover each other's sources when it's a good story because otherwise everyone would get hold of it.\" Hedges had relied on the U.S. embassy in Turkey for further confirmation of the man's identity.\n\nHedges wrote two more articles that year that were informed by Chalabi-coached defectors. The second one, claiming that Iraq still held 80 Kuwaitis captured in the 1991 Gulf War in a secret underground prison, was also found to be baseless.\n\nHedges was an early critic of the Iraq War. In May 2003, Hedges delivered a commencement address at Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois, saying: \"We are embarking on an occupation that, if history is any guide, will be as damaging to our souls as it will be to our prestige and power and security.\" His speech was received with boos and his microphone was shut off three minutes after he began speaking.\n\n\"The New York Times\", his employer, criticized his statements and issued him a formal reprimand for \"public remarks that could undermine public trust in the paper's impartiality\". Shortly after the incident, Hedges left \"The New York Times\" to become a senior fellow at The Nation Institute, and a columnist at Truthdig, in addition to writing books and teaching inmates at a New Jersey correctional institution.\n\nHedges has worked for a decade teaching in prisons in New Jersey, and he has become a fierce critic of mass incarceration in the United States.\n\nIn the 2008 United States presidential campaign, Hedges was a speech writer for candidate Ralph Nader.\n\nIn his December 29, 2008, column for Truthdig, Hedges stated that \"[t]he inability to articulate a viable socialism has been our gravest mistake. It will ensure, if this does not soon change, a ruthless totalitarian capitalism\". He elaborated upon this in a 2013 interview with The Real News, claiming that \n\"the left has been destroyed, especially the radical left, quite consciously in the whole name of anti-communism\", and \"we have allowed ourselves to embrace an ideology which, at its core, states that all governance is about maximizing corporate profit at the expense of the citizenry. For what do we have structures of government, for what do we have institutions of state, if not to hold up all the citizenry, and especially the most vulnerable?\".\n\nIn a March 2009 column, Hedges warned that human over-population and mass species extinction are serious problems, and that any measures to save the ecosystem will be futile unless we cut population growth, and noted that, \"As long as the Earth is viewed as the personal property of the human race, a belief embraced by everyone from born-again Christians to Marxists to free-market economists, we are destined to soon inhabit a biological wasteland.\"\n\nOn December 8, 2009, Hedges identified as a \"radical Keynesian\" during his lecture at The New School, entitled \"Empire of Illusion\".\n\nOn December 16, 2010, Hedges was arrested outside the White House along with Daniel Ellsberg and more than 100 activists who were protesting the war in Afghanistan.\n\nHedges appeared as a guest on an October 2011 episode of the CBC News Network's \"Lang and O'Leary Exchange\" to discuss his support for the Occupy Wall Street protests; co-host Kevin O'Leary criticized him, saying that he sounded \"like a left-wing nutbar\". Hedges said \"it will be the last time\" he appears on the show, and compared the CBC to Fox News. CBC's ombudsman found O'Leary's heated remarks to be a violation of the public broadcaster's journalistic standards.\n\nOn November 3, 2011, Hedges was arrested with others in New York as part of the Occupy Wall Street demonstration, during which the activists staged a \"people's hearing\" on the activities of the investment bank Goldman Sachs and blocked the entrance to their corporate headquarters. Hedges has appeared on the syndicated \"Democracy Now!\" television program; on \"Breaking the Set\" on RT (formerly known as Russia Today), and on CBC's \"George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight\".\n\nIn October 2012, Hedges publicly supported Jill Stein, the candidate of the Green Party of the United States, in the 2012 United States presidential election. On April 7, 2013, Hedges delivered the keynote address at the Green Party of New Jersey state convention.<ref name=\"Green Party to livestream Chris Hedges keynote at NJ GP annual meeting, Sun. 4/9\"></ref>\n\nIn June 2013, Hedges and numerous celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning.\n\nOn September 20, 2014, a day before the People's Climate March, Hedges joined Bernie Sanders, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, and Kshama Sawant on a panel moderated by WNYC's Brian Lehrer to discuss the issue of climate change. Hedges and Klein also participated in the 'Flood Wall Street' protests that occurred shortly thereafter.\n\nOn November 11, 2014, Hedges published an article explaining why he and his family have become vegan. He explained that this is \"the most important and direct change we can immediately make to save the planet and its species\".\n\nIn a December 15, 2014, article, Hedges compared the actions of ISIS today to the way Israel's founding fathers acted in the late 1940s.\n\nHedges contended at the Left Forum in 2015 that with the \"denouement of capitalism and the disintegration of globalism\", Karl Marx has been \"vindicated as capitalism's most prescient and important critic\". He said that Marx \"foresaw that capitalism had built within it the seeds of its own destruction. He knew that reigning ideologies—think neoliberalism—were created to serve the interests of the elites and in particular the economic elites.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2016, Hedges was arrested, along with 100 other protesters, during a sit-in outside the U.S. Capitol during Democracy Spring to protest the capture of the political system by corporations.\n\nCommenting on the 2016 election during an interview on The Real News, Hedges asserted that the modern American Left's embrace of neoliberalism resulted in a dysfunctional democracy and has given rise to a Trump presidency, which he characterizes as \"proto-fascist\". Hedges argues that logical result of neoliberalism is neofascism. At a March 2017 speech delivered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Hedges insisted that resistance to the Trump Administration must be broadly socialist and anti-capitalist in nature:\nThis resistance must also be accompanied by an alternative vision of a socialist, anti-capitalist society. Because the enemy in the end is not Trump or Bannon—it is corporate power. And if we do not stop corporate power, we will never dismantle fascism's seduction of the white working class and unemployed.\"\n\nIn 2012, after the Obama Administration signed the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, Hedges sued members of the U.S. government, claiming that section 1021 of the law unconstitutionally allowed presidential authority for indefinite detention without \"habeas corpus\". He was later joined in the suit, \"Hedges v. Obama\", by activists including Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg. In May 2012 Judge Katherine B. Forrest of the Southern District of New York ruled that the counter-terrorism provision of the NDAA is unconstitutional. The Obama administration appealed the decision and it was overturned. Hedges petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, but the Supreme Court denied certiorari in April 2014.\n\nOn October 5, 2014, Hedges was ordained a minister within the Presbyterian Church. He was installed as Associate Pastor and Minister of Social Witness and Prison Ministry at the Second Presbyterian Church Elizabeth in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He noted having been rejected for ordination 30 years earlier, saying that \"going to El Salvador as a reporter was not something the Presbyterian Church at the time recognized as a valid ministry, and a committee rejected my 'call.\n\nChris Hedges is married to the Canadian actress Eunice Wong. The couple have two children. Hedges also has two children from a previous marriage. He currently lives in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n"}

He competed as a member of the British equestrian team in the 1924 Summer Olympics, although he had broken his collarbone a few days earlier.\n\nBrooke had three children: Rodney Gerald Searight, born 1909; Pamela Searight, born 1915; and John Philip Searight, born 1917.\n\nIn 1930, Geoffrey Brooke was appointed to the command of the British Cavalry Brigade in Egypt. It was at this time that Dorothy Brooke realised she would have to search for the old war horses, whom “she hated to remember yet could not forget”. She could not be in Egypt and fail to do so. She had been devoted to horses since her childhood.\n\nIn 1919, the cavalry, artillery and draught horses that had served in the British Army in the Egypt and Palestine campaigns of World War I had been sold in their many thousands to a life of continuous hard labour and a painful old age. Many had been requisitioned in England and had served in the British Yeomanry. Some had seen active service on the Western Front before being drafted as remounts to the Near East. Strict quarantine restrictions prevented the repatriation of the horses of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Infantry.\n\nDuring World War I, horses cast from the veterinary hospitals had initially been sold to Egyptian dealers. British residents in Cairo had protested so forcefully that this practice had been stopped.\n\nAfter the Armistice, however, with 22,000 horses, mostly in Palestine and Sinai, requiring transport or disposal, the Remounts Directorate of the War Office ordered the local sale of all animals of 12 years and under that were deemed up to some work. Those over 12 and the unsound were destroyed.\n\nThe surviving horses had not had an easy war. They had carried often far too much weight – up to . They had experienced rationing, withstood piercing cold, dust clouds and exhaustion. Some may also have suffered both severe and light wounds. They had covered great distances, and some had endured a summer in the heat of the Jordan Valley.\n\nBy 1930, twelve years later, the war horses, many now of an advanced age, had been lost to view, toiling for the very poorest owners, or at night to avoid the police and Egyptian S.P.C.A., or in the stone quarries. Brooke had heard rumours from British residents who spoke of pitiful, emaciated creatures that they suspected were war horses. Their condition was said to be so bad that people could hardly bear to look at them. She was advised there could be two hundred. Weeks passed before she found the first, but there were to be more than two hundred. In fact in the years from 1930 to 1934, she bought back 5,000 old army horses and mules.\n\nThere were many challenges and obstacles throughout the early years of Brooke’s efforts. Progress was prolonged, and, as the wife of the senior cavalry officer in Egypt, she had strenuous social duties. Nevertheless, she acquired frail old horses when and where she found them. She raised money from her friends and from her own pocket, got together a Committee, and set in motion the Old War Horse Campaign of Rescue. By April 1931, six months after her arrival in Egypt, she was writing to the Morning Post to appeal for funds. Thousands of readers responded. King George V was one of her many supporters throughout the British Commonwealth.\n\nAt first, she used the premises of the Egyptian S.P.C.A., but this was to prove unrealistic in the long term, and it was difficult to find light, airy stables in Cairo – and to gain the necessary permission. However, she was persistent in working to raise money. During the first summer leave, she produced an 8-page pamphlet. There were further appeals in the press.\n\nAlmost all the old war horses were totally unfit to stand a voyage home. They were pathetically grateful for a drink and for somewhere to lie down.\n\n“As their ill-shod misshapen hooves felt the deep tibbin [broken barley straw] bed beneath them, there would be another doubting disbelieving halt. Then gradually they would lower their heads and sniff as though they could not believe their own eyes or noses. Memories, long forgotten, would then return when some stepped eagerly forwards towards the mangers piled high with berseem, while others, with creaking joints, lowered themselves slowly on to the bed and lay, necks and legs outstretched. There they remained, flat out, until hand fed by the syces.”\n\nThey were given days of rest, and feed, and treated to kindness, and then put out of what was, for so many, their extreme misery. Very few were returned to England.\n\nBrooke had the services of a Buying Committee. It was composed largely of high-ranking British officers, where it is thought she the only woman. The Chairman was General Sir Charlton Spinks, Sirdar of the Egyptian Army and fluent in Arabic. Other members included Major (later Brigadier) Roland Heveningham, R.A.V.C., who was to be first Veterinary Director of the Old War Horse Memorial Hospital, and Brigadier Geoffrey Brooke.\n\nThe Committee was buying up to 60 or 70 animals every week, and scouts searched throughout Egypt. It was a grim task. Sometimes, one of the male committee members might be too anguished to remain at the table. In the years 1930 to 1934, some 5,000 horses and old army mules were found. They were identified by their conformation and army brands. The price paid represented the cost to the owner of a replacement.\n\nOn a Friday, ‘Black Friday’, the day after Buying Day – and for nine months of the year, every year for four years – Dorothy Brooke would select those to be destroyed, quietly and without alarm, by humane killer.\n\nBrooke never sought to blame the men and boys who through poverty and lack of knowledge, had failed their animals. The ‘tragic sight’ of the locally bred animals that appeared before the Buying Committee made her realise that a free hospital was needed – to which every poor owner could bring what might be his family’s sole earner, and obtain expert help and advice at the first signs of trouble instead of waiting hopelessly. She had set up a separate fund almost from the start. She called this The Animal Assistance Fund.\n\nBrooke attracted some criticism. Some of the British who were long familiar with Egypt felt that she was going too far in removing such a number of draught animals from a traditional economy. Others asserted that the Committee was buying frauds.\n\nAt the end of four years, the war horse campaign could be closed. The Old War Horse Memorial Hospital was founded. Dorothy Brooke gained permission for the Hospital to place a drinking trough at the Pyramids. The Cairo city authorities eventually adopted a policy of sanding the slippery stretches of street.\n\nGeoffrey and Dorothy Brooke moved from Egypt to India, where Geoffrey became Major-General of Cavalry. There Dorothy, besides giving her time and energy to the affairs of the Hospital, “threw herself into working to alleviate the suffering she saw all about her”. She managed to return to Cairo for an annual visit.\n\nThe Brookes left India at the outbreak of World War II. After a gap – through precarious years for the Hospital – Dorothy Brooke was able to resume her trips to Egypt in 1946. In 1955, at their house in Heliopolis, on the outskirts of Cairo, she was not well enough to travel back to Wiltshire. She is reported as having remarked to her husband, some weeks beforehand, “If I die – not that I am going to for ever so long – promise me you won’t go to my funeral service. I know it will only distress you and I shan’t be there myself.”\n\nDorothy Brooke died on 10 June 1955 and was buried in Cairo.\n\n“Looking back on all she had accomplished,” remarks Glenda Spooner, “one can feel certain that she thought little of her own share and a great deal of other people’s, for that was ever her way. She was indeed overwhelmed with gratitude to those who had made the rescue of the horses possible and it was no mean achievement.” \n\nAfter his stepfather’s death in 1966, Major Philip Searight succeeded Geoffrey Brooke as Chairman. He guided the organisation through a period of expansion. Dorothy Brooke’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren have maintained a tradition of service to The Brooke. Ann Searight, her granddaughter, served as a Trustee 1979-2011 and in 2014 is Honorary Vice-President.\n\n\n"}

She became a paraplegic after contracting polio as a small child. She won several medals in the 1964 and 1968 Summer Paralympics. She subsequently retired from swimming, only taking up the sport again in 2006 to compete in the 2008 FINA World Masters Championships in Perth.\n\nElizabeth Edmondson was born on 1 July 1950 in Perth, Western Australia. On 27 September 1951, at the age of 15 months, she was diagnosed with polio. She spent fifteen months in the hospital. Her father made changes to the house to make it easier for her to get around, including the addition of parallel bars to help her learn to walk. She started swimming when she was five years old, at Crawley Baths in the Swan River. The first strokes she learnt to swim were the backstroke, dog paddle and freestyle. She learnt to swim without using her legs. She first placed in a swimming competition during a competition in year one at school, where she finished third in a dog paddle swim.\n\nHer first calliper did not allow her to bend her knee. She was excited to receive her first calliper that allowed her knee to bend when she was ten years old. Edmondson had other issues with footwear as a youngster. As her feet grew, she outgrew her custom-made footwear. To extend the life of her shoes, the toes were cut out of them to provide more space for her own toes.\n\nWhen Edmonson was 14, her coach told her she had broken a world record while swimming at Beatty Park as a member of the Swimming Squad. To qualify for the 1964 Summer Paralympics, she competed at the Third Australian Paraplegic Games held in Adelaide, South Australia. At the Australian Paraplegic Games in 1964, she broke a world record and a Commonwealth record. She won a gold medal in the 50m backstroke class e event with a time of 51.8 seconds, 15.2 seconds faster than the previous Commonwealth record time that she beat. The event was the Australian qualifying competition for the 1964 Summer Paralympics.\n\nAround the time that Elizabeth was starting to prepare for the Paralympics, she was a student at St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls, a member of the West Perth Swimming Club, and an avid surfer. Edmondson put her surfing on hold to spend more time training.\n\nAt the age of 14 years and 4 months, Edmondson was an Australian Paralympic competitor. She was the youngest competitor at the 1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo among athletes from all nations. She was the youngest Paralympic gold medallist for Australia for 48 years, until Maddison Elliott won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Paralympics. She won three gold medals in the 1964 Summer Paralympics in the following events: the women's class 5 50 metre breaststroke with a world record time of 1.04.6; women's class 5 50 metre backstroke with a world record time of 0.50.8; women's class 5 complete 50 metre freestyle with a world record time of 0.39.7. At the conclusion of the 1964 Games, Edmondson's parents acknowledged that swimming had greatly helped their daughter, but felt that she needed to quit the sport and concentrate on her education because swimming would not provide her with standing in life. After the 1964 games, Edmondson returned home and prepared for school exams.\n\nEdmondson and Lorraine Dodd met Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at a garden party hosted at Government House when she visited Perth in 1966. Edmondson did not compete in the 1966 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games, due to difficulty finding funding to go to Jamaica, a plight common to many Western Australian athletes.\n\nEdmondson won a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv in the 50 metre freestyle class 4 incomplete swimming event with a world record time of 0.44.1 and a gold medal in the 100 metre open freestyle swim event with a world record time of 1.33.0. She also won a silver medal in Women's 50m Backstroke class 4 incomplete in a time of 52.3.\n\nEdmondson competed with limited mobility in the water, during the Paralympics and the rest of her swimming career: She could only use her arms and shoulders to move through the water. Edmondson's swimming coach, Tony Howson, claimed that her swimming times were similar to those of able-bodied girls of the same age. She stopped competing after the 1968 Games for financial reasons, and was employed at Telstra.\n\nIn 2006, she started to participate in competitive swimming again when she joined the Stadium Masters Swimming Club. In 2008, she qualified for the FINA World Masters Championships and swam a personal best time in the 800m Freestyle. From 2007 to 2009, she competed in several swimming events in a variety of strokes and distances around Australia in the women's 55–59 age group. In October 2007, at the 11th Australian Masters Games, she won 7 individual gold medals and a 1 gold in a relay as a disabled swimmer. She also won a bronze medal in a member of a team in an abled bodied relay event.\n\nIn February 2009, she swam in the 12th Australian Masters Games and won 7 individual gold medals and 2 gold for relay events as a disabled swimmer .\n\nAt the 2009 World Masters Games in Sydney, she won four gold medals and a silver medal in the age group 55 to 69 years.\n\nEdmondson competed at the 2010 Australian National Masters Swimming Championships, held in Launceston, Tasmania. She competed in twelve individual events, and set eleven individual personal records. Her travel to the event was paid for by Wheelchair Sports WA through the Sir George Bedbrook Scholarship fund.\n\nEdmondson competed at the 2011 X111 Australian Masters Games held in Adelaide, South Australia. She competed as a disabled swimmer in six individual events and four relays and won ten gold medals. Edmondson competed at the 2013 X1V Australian Masters Games held in Geelong, Victoria. She competed as a disabled swimmer in seven individual events and two relays and won nine gold medals.\n\nEdmondson swam in the British Long Distance Swimming Association's One Hour Postal Swim from 2009 to 2012. She is also a qualified swimming marshall.\n\nEdmondson was awarded the Australian Sports Medal in 2000, in recognition of her work as a swimmer. Edmondson was inducted into the Swimming Western Australia Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2009, Edmondson was inducted into the Wheelchair Sports WA Hall of Fame. Edmondson was awarded a Certificate of Commendation in 2012 by Masters Swimming Western Australia for her services to Masters Swimming.\n\nIn 2018 she became the first inductee into the Swimming WA Hall of Legends recognising \"outstanding swimming performances at an international level... deemed to have inspired the nation and to have established the name of the athlete, their State and their country on the world stage.\"\n\nAfter she started working for Telstra, she married Ken Mills and had a daughter, Ruth. In December 2008, Edmondson was diagnosed with breast cancer. Her treatment involved having a lumpectomy.\n\n"}

In 1738, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough wrote of her that \"notwithstanding the great pride of the Berkeley family she married an innkeeper's son,\" and maliciously adds in explanation that \"she was very ugly, without a portion, and in her youth had an unlucky accident with one of her father's servants.\" The so-called innkeeper's son was Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet (1650–1718), who was rumored to be the illegitimate son of William II, Prince of Orange and accordingly half-brother of King William III. Lady Betty met Germain at the Hot Wells, Bristol, and they were shortly thereafter married in October 1706. He was a recent widower, having first married Mary Mordaunt, Baroness Mordaunt, only child and heiress of the 2nd Earl of Peterborough, after her first husband, Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk had divorced her in 1700 over her love affair with Germain. Betty was thirty years younger than her husband, but her good sense made their union happy.\n\nThey had three children, two boys and a girl, all of whom died young, and in acknowledgment of her devotion in nursing them Germain left her the estate of Drayton in Northamptonshire, and the vast property which he had inherited from his first wife, who had died childless. On his deathbed, he expressed the wish that she would marry a young man and have children to succeed to her wealth, but hoped that otherwise her fortune might pass to a younger son of Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, who had married Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-general Walter Philip Colyear, Germain's friend and colleague in the Dutch service. Though almost persuaded in later years to marry Lord Sidney Beauclerk, a handsome and worthless fortune-hunter, she remained a widow for more than fifty years, and fulfilled her husband's wishes by leaving the estate of Drayton, with £20,000 in money and half the residue of her wealth, to the politician Lord George Sackville, the Duke's second son, who in turn assumed the name of Germain.\n\nIn 1730 she received a threatening anonymous letter left outside her London residence demanding £50 in return for her life. The Duke of Dorset showed the letter to the king, George II who ordered that Lady Betty was to have the protection of a file of musketeers. \n\nLady Betty passed most of her widowhood in her own apartments at Knole House, near Sevenoaks in west Kent, the seat of her friends the Duke and Duchess of Dorset, or at her London town house in St. James's Square where she entertained politicians regardless of party or faction. She only occasionally visited Drayton House, which she retained in much the condition her husband left it. Originally built in the 14th century and expanded over the centuries, Drayton had been lavishly remodelled in the early 18th century following Baroness Mordaunt's marriage to Germain. After her death, he continued to devote considerable attention to the estate, including his formal Dutch gardens, which Lady Betty maintained as they had been in his lifetime.\n\nShe died at her town house on 16 December 1769. Her elder sister married Thomas Chamber of Ilanworth, Middlesex, and had two daughters, who, as their parents died young, were brought up entirely under Lady Betty's guardianship. The elder niece, Mary, married Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere. The younger, Anne, became the wife of Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple, a close political associate of his brother-in-law, William Pitt (the Elder), 1st Earl of Chatham. Most of the balance of Lady Betty's estate was left to Lady Vere, and the disposition of her money is set out in a letter from Vere to Temple. She left £120,000 in the funds.\n\nHorace Walpole paid a visit to Drayton in 1763, and found the house \"covered with portraits, crammed with old china\". Many of her curiosities were sold after her death, by auction. The cameos and intaglios collected by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, were bequeathed to Germain by his first wife. Lady Betty offered the collection to the British Museum for £10,000, and, as the offer was declined, gave them in 1762 to her great-niece, Lady Mary Beauclerk, who married Lord Charles Spencer, son of the 3rd Duke of Marlborough. These gems were described in two folio volumes entitled \"Gemmarum antiquarum delectus quse in dactyliothecis Ducis Marlburiensis conservantur\", 1781–90; the engravings were chiefly by Bartolozzi, and the Latin text by Jacob Bryant and William Cole (1753–1806). The gems were part of the Marlborough collection sold in 1875 for £36,750.\n\nShe is acknowledged to have \"outlived the irregularities of her youth, and she was esteemed for her kindness and liberality.\" She gave £500 to the Foundling Hospital in 1746. Her politics were indicated by a present of £100 to John Wilkes during his imprisonment.\n\nJonathan Swift was chaplain to her father from 1699 to 1701, while the Earl of Berkeley was lord justice in Ireland, and Lady Betty and Swift continued their friendship during the various times he spent in England. She added a stanza to the dean's ballad on the game of traffic, written at Dublin Castle in 1699, which produced from him in August 1702 a second ballad \"to the tune of the Cutpurse.\" Her name is often mentioned in the \"Journal to Stella\", and as a vocal Whig, she often disputed with the dean on political topics. Many letters to and from her are included in Swift's \"Works\" and in the \"Suffolk Correspondence\". Her spirited letter to Swift defending her friend Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk (George II's mistress and Betty's future sister-in-law) against Swift's harsh censure is especially singled out as doing her \"great honour\". Though their correspondence appears to have ceased in 1737, she retained him in her affections, and a portrait of Swift still hangs in her rooms at Knole. Edward Young dedicated to Lady Betty his sixth satire on women, and according to a correspondent in Nichols's \"Literary Anecdotes\", she was credited with having written a satire on Alexander Pope. The manuscripts at Drayton, which include communications to and from Lady Betty, are described in the Historical Manuscripts Commission's report on the MSS of Mrs Stopford Sackville of Drayton House.\n\nA brass plaque commemorating her is found at St Peter's Church, Lowick, near to Sir John Germain's tomb.\n\n"}
{"id": "53768121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53768121", "title": "Eroseanna Robinson", "text": "Eroseanna Robinson\n\nEroseanna “Sis” Robinson was an American social worker, track star, activist and member of the Peacemakers who organized for desegregation and against the U.S. military in the 1950s and 1960s. In particular, she was an advocate of nonviolent resistance strategies. Robinson went on hunger strike or risked violence and arrest multiple times, but nonetheless won various victories for equality. Born in 1924, Robinson died at age in 52 in 1976.\n\nIn addition to her activism, Robinson was a successful track runner. These two interests collided when she was chosen to represent the United States in a track meet against Russia and refused to participate because she felt she was being used as a “political pawn” by appearing alongside white athletes, giving the international community the false impression that white and black people were treated equally inside of the United States.\n\nIn 1952, Eroseanna Robinson worked at a community center in Cleveland when she decided that she would help to desegregate a public skating facility called Skateland. In trying to accomplish this goal, she pursued a non-violent plan. In her first attempt to desegregate Skateland, she brought children—two black children and one white child—from the community center at which she worked to skate. White teenagers harassed the children. Over the next few days, Robinson returned with friends who supported her cause but was continually tripped and physically assaulted by white customers at Skateland. At one point, Robinson required urgent medical attention after she was shoved, causing her to break an arm. Skateland’s management and security teams did not intervene on Robinson’s behalf.\n\nIn early 1960, Robinson held another nonviolent protest by refusing to pay federal taxes as a way of showing her lack of support for the United States military. Her refusal to pay taxes caused her to be sentenced to a year of imprisonment, but she used the process as an opportunity to engage in nonviolent protest. When she was sentenced, Robinson has to be carried into the courtroom on a stretcher because she refused to walk. Once she was in prison, she held a three-month fast. She was force fed through a tube and then released nine months before her sentence was complete.\n\nIn 1961, Eroseanna Robinson travelled along Route 40 in Maryland with Wally and Juanita Nelson. The three decided to stop for dinner in Elkton, Maryland, but a diner refused to serve them. The trio refused to leave until police came and arrested them, putting them in county jail. In jail, they refused to appear in court or eat. Their story was picked up by local newspapers which dubbed them the “Elkton Three.” Since the trio refused to cooperate with the court proceedings, they were given $50 fines and released. Their case sparked a local movement for desegregation that ended up gaining then Maryland Governor Millar Tawes’ attention and led to eventual desegregation of restaurants along Route 40.\n\nAlthough not widely known amongst other African American civil rights activists, Robinson was instrumental in integrating several public spaces across the country in the early days of the Civil Rights Movement. She is perhaps most remembered for her methods of nonviolent resistance, which were deployed in sit-ins and other pro-integration demonstrations throughout the latter part of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nHer work to integrate restaurants along Maryland’s Route 40 had international ramifications, as foreign diplomats would often travel the road in trips from Washington, D.C.. to New York City. In 1958, Kenyan politician Komla Gbedema was denied service at a restaurant on Route 40, which embarrassed the Eisenhower administration. With the slogan “49 Miles of Highway and No Place to Stop and Eat,” Robinson, the Nelsons, and others were able to integrate these Maryland restaurants, which at the time hurt the United State’s international reputation. During several of Robinson’s hunger strikes, she also garnered headlines in African American publications, who lauded her relentless commitment to achieve racial justice.\n\nRobinson stands as an icon of the war tax resistance movement. The National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee, a grassroots movement with the aim of educating American taxpayers of their rights to resist making tax contributions to war efforts, touts Robinson as a foundational figure in their movement.\n\nSocial work, as a profession, has a history of leadership within social justice movements that dates back to the work of activists like Robinson. Today, social workers carry on this legacy of activism through grassroots movements such as RISE.\n"}

Vincent was a bank examiner and relocated to Washington D.C. in 1930. Her mother suffered from undiagnosed and untreated depression, this led to a challenging marriage, and ultimately a divorce. Vincent gained custody of all children and moved to Tuckahoe, New York.\n\nAfter graduating from high school Evelyn joined the Women's Army Corps, and was stationed in Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\nShe later moved to Baldwin, New York and was employed as a bookkeeper at the Kitab Engraving Company on Pearl Street. She met her fiance Barry Rhodes, a college student discharged from the United States Army Air Force.\n\nOn April 30, 1947, McHale took a train from New York to Easton, Pennsylvania to visit Rhodes. The next day, after leaving Rhodes' residence, she returned to New York City and went to the Empire State Building where she jumped from the 86th floor observatory. A security guard was reportedly standing approximately ten feet from her just before she jumped.\n\nRhodes did not notice any indication of suicide before McHale left. Detective Frank Murray found her suicide note in a black pocketbook next to her neatly folded cloth coat over the observation deck wall which read:\n\nHer body was identified by her sister, Helen Brenner.\n\nIn accordance with her wishes, she was cremated with no memorial, service or grave.\n\nHer then-fiance, Barry became an engineer before moving South, he died in Melbourne, Florida on October 9th 2007, unmarried.\n\nThe photo of her body, taken by Robert Wiles, has been compared to the photograph by Malcolm Wilde Browne of the self-immolation of Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức who burned himself alive at a busy Saigon road intersection on June 11, 1963, which is widely regarded as among the most iconic suicide photographs. Ben Cosgrove of \"Time\" described the photo as \"technically rich, visually compelling and ... downright beautiful\". Cosgrove described her body as \"resting, or napping, rather than ... dead\" and appears as if she is \"daydreaming of her beau\".\n\nAndy Warhol used Wiles' photo in one of his prints entitled \"Suicide (Fallen Body)\".\n\nHer picture was also used on the cover of Saccharine Trust's album \"Surviving You, Always\", released in 1984 by SST Records.\n\nDavid Bowie's 1993 video for the single \"Jump They Say\" includes a recreation of the image, with the singer splayed atop a smashed car.\n\nThe cover of the 1995 album \"Gilt\" by the Tucson band Machines of Loving Grace uses a color photo that recreates the original image.\n\nThe shot is also referenced at the start of Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' video.\n"}

It was called Quetzalcoatl among the Aztecs, Kukulkan among the Yucatec Maya, and Q'uq'umatz and Tohil among the K'iche' Maya. The double symbolism used in its name is considered allegoric to the dual nature of the deity, where being feathered represents its divine nature or ability to fly to reach the skies and being a serpent represents its human nature or ability to creep on the ground among other animals of the Earth, a dualism very common in Mesoamerican deities.\n\nThe earliest representations of feathered serpents appear in the Olmec culture (circa 1400-400 BCE). Most surviving representations in Olmec art, such as at La Venta and a painting in the Juxtlahuaca cave (see below), show it as a crested rattlesnake, sometimes with feathers covering the body and legs, and often in close proximity to humans. It is believed that Olmec supernatural entities such as the feathered serpent were the forerunners of many later Mesoamerican deities, although experts disagree on the feathered serpent's importance to the Olmec.\n\nThe pantheon of the people of Teotihuacan (200 BCE – 700 CE) also featured a feathered serpent, shown most prominently on the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (dated 150–200 CE). Several feathered serpent representations appear on the building, including full-body profiles and feathered serpent heads.\n\nBuildings in Tula, the capital of the later Toltecs (950–1150 CE), also featured profiles of feathered serpents.\n\nThe Aztec feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl is known from several Aztec codices such as the Florentine codex, as well as from the records of the Spanish conquistadors. Quetzalcoatl was a bringer of knowledge, the inventor of books, and associated with the planet Venus.\n\nThe corresponding Mayan god Kukulkan was rare in the Classic era Maya civilization. However, in the Popol Vuh, the K'iche' feathered serpent god Tepeu Q'uq'umatz is the creator of the cosmos.\n\nAlong with the feathered serpent deity, several other serpent gods existed in the pantheon of Mesoamerican gods with similar traits.\n\n\n"}

Two Romance languages are widely spoken and official in Galicia: the native Galician and, mainly because of language shift, Castilian.\n\nThe ethnonym Galicians (\"Galegos\") derives from the Latin \"Gallaeci\" or \"Callaeci\", itself an adaptation of the name of a local Celtic tribe known to the Greeks as Καλλαϊκoί (\"Kallaikoí\"), who lived in what is now northern Portugal and who were conquered by the Roman General Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus in the 2nd century BCE. The Romans later applied this name to all the people who shared the same culture and language in the northwest, from the Douro River valley in the south to the Cantabrian Sea in the north and west to the Navia River, encompassing tribes as the Celtici, the Artabri, the Lemavi and the Albiones, among others.\n\nThe etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors such as Isidore of Seville, who wrote that \"Galicians are called so because of their fair skin, as the Gauls\", relating the name to the Greek word for milk. However, modern scholars have derived the name of the ancient \"Callaeci\" either from Proto-Indo-European *\"kal-n-eH\" 'hill', through a local relational suffix \"-aik-\", so meaning 'the highlanders'; or either from Proto-Celtic *\"kallī\"- 'forest', so meaning 'the forest (people)'. \n\nThe most recent proposal comes from linguist Francesco Benozzo after identifying the root \"gall-\" / \"kall-\" in a number of Celtic words with the meaning \"stone\" or \"rock\", as follows: \"gall\" (old Irish), \"gal\" (Middle Welsh), \"gailleichan\" (Scottish Gaelic), \"kailhoù\" (Breton), \"galagh\" (Manx) and \"gall\" (Gaulish). Hence, Benozzo explains the name \"Callaecia\" and its ethnonym \"Callaeci\" as being \"the stone people\" or \"the people of the stone\" (\"those who work with stones\"), in reference to the ancient megaliths and stone formations so common in Galicia.\n\nGalician is a Romance language belonging to the Western Ibero-Romance branch; as such, it derives from Latin. It has official status in Galicia. Galician is also spoken in the neighbouring autonomous communities of Asturias and Castile and León, near theirs borders with Galicia.\n\nMedieval or Old Galician, also known by linguists as Galician-Portuguese, developed locally in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula from Vulgar Latin, becoming the language spoken and written in the medieval kingdoms of Galicia (from 1230 united with the kingdoms of Leon and Castille under the same sovereign) and Portugal. The Galician-Portuguese language developed a rich literary tradition from the last years of the 12th century. During the 13th century it gradually substituted Latin as the language used in public and private charters, deeds, and legal documents, in Galicia, Portugal, and in the neighbouring regions in Asturias and Leon.\n\nGalician-Portuguese diverged into two linguistic varieties - Galician and Portuguese - from the 15th century on. Galician became a regional variety open to the influence of Castilian Spanish, while Portuguese became the international one, as language of the Portuguese Empire. The two varieties are still close together, and in particular northern Portuguese dialects share an important number of similarities with Galician ones.\n\nThe official institution regulating the Galician language, backed by the Galician government and universities, the Royal Galician Academy, claims that modern Galician must be considered an independent Romance language belonging to the group of Ibero-Romance languages and having strong ties with Portuguese and its northern dialects.\n\nHowever, the \"Associaçom Galega da Língua\" (Galician Language Association) and \"Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa\" (Galician Academy of the Portuguese Language), belonging to the Reintegrationist movement, support the idea that differences between Galician and Portuguese speech are not enough to justify considering them as separate languages: Galician is simply one variety of Galician-Portuguese, along with Brazilian Portuguese, African Portuguese, the Galician-Portuguese still spoken in Spanish Extremadura, (\"Fala\"), and other variations.\nNowadays, despite the positive effects of official recognition of the Galician language, Galicia's socio-linguistic development has experienced the growing influence of Spanish due the media as well as legal imposition of Spanish in learning.\n\nGalicia also boasts a rich oral tradition, in the form of songs, tales, and sayings, which has made a vital contribution to the spread and development of the Galician language. Still flourishing today, this tradition shares much with that of Portugal.\n\nMany Galician surnames have become Castilianized over the centuries, most notably after the forced submission of the Galician nobility obtained by the Catholic Monarchs in the last years of the 15th century. This reflected the gradual spread of Spanish language, through the cities, in Santiago de Compostela, Lugo, A Coruña, Vigo and Ferrol, in the last case due to the establishment of an important base of the Spanish navy there in the 18th century.\n\nFor example, surnames like \"Orxás\", \"Veiga\", \"Outeiro\", became \"Orjales\", \"Vega\", \"Otero\". Toponyms like \"Ourense\", \"A Coruña\", \"Fisterra\" became \"Orense\", \"La Coruña\", \"Finisterre\". In many cases this linguistic assimilation created confusion, for example \"Niño da Aguia\" (Galician: \"Eagle's Nest\") was translated into Spanish as \"Niño de la Guía\" (Spanish: the Guide's child) and \"Mesón do Bento\" (Galician: \"Benedict's house\") was translated as \"Mesón del Viento\" (Spanish: House of Wind).\n\nIn pre-historic times Galicia was one of the primary foci of Atlantic European Megalithic Culture. Following on that, the gradual emergence of a Celtic culture gave way to a well established material Celtic civilization known as the Castro Culture. Galicia suffered a relatively late and weak Romanisation, although it was after this event when Latin, which is considered to be the main root of modern Galician, eventually replaced the old Gallaecian language.\n\nThe decline of the Roman Empire was followed by the rule of Germanic tribes, namely the Suebi, who formed a separate Galician kingdom in 409, and the Visigoths. In 718 the area briefly came under the control of the Moors after their conquest and dismantling of the Visigothic Empire, but the Galicians successfully rebelled against Moorish rule in 739, establishing a renewed Kingdom of Galicia which would become totally stable after 813 with the medieval popularization of the \"Way of St James\".\n\nThe autonomous community (a concept established in the Spanish constitution of 1978) that is known as \"(a) Comunidade Autónoma Galega\" in Galician, and as \"(la) Comunidad Autónoma Gallega\" in Spanish (in English: \"Galician Autonomous Community\"), is composed of the four Spanish provinces of A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra.\n\nThe official Statistical body of Galicia is the \"Instituto Galego de Estatística\" (IGE). According to the IGE, Galicia's total population in 2008 was 2,783,100 (1,138,474 in A Coruña, 355.406 in Lugo, 336.002 in Ourense, and 953.218 in Pontevedra). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centres, are Vigo, Pontevedra (in Pontevedra), Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Ferrol (in A Coruña), Lugo (in Lugo), and Ourense (in Ourense). The official languages are Galician and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory according to the Spanish constitution and virtually universal. Knowledge of Galician, after declining for many years owing to the pressure of Spanish and official persecution, is again on the rise due to favorable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 82% of Galicia's population can speak Galician and about 61% has it as a mother tongue.\n\nIn the 19th century a group of Romantic and Nationalist writers and scholars, among them Eduardo Pondal and Manuel Murguía, led a \"Celtic revival\" initially based on the historical testimonies of ancient Roman and Greek authors (Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, Strabo and Ptolemy), who wrote about the Celtic peoples who inhabited Galicia; but they also based this revival in linguistic and onomastic data, and in the similarity of some aspects of the culture and the geography of Galicia with that of the Celtic countries in Ireland, Brittany and Britain. The similarities include legends and traditions, decorative and popular arts and music. It also included the green hilly landscape or the ubiquity of Iron Age hill-forts, Neolithic megaliths and Bronze Age cup and ring marks.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century this revival permeated Galician society: in 1916 \"Os Pinos\", a poem by Eduardo Pondal, was chosen as the lyrics for the new Galician hymn. One of the strophes of the poem says: \"Galicians, be strong / ready to great deeds / align your breast / for a glorious end / sons of the noble Celts / strong and traveler / fight for the fate / of the homeland of Breogán\". The Celtic past became an integral part of the self-perceived Galician identity: as a result an important number of cultural association and sport clubs received names related to the Celts, among them Celta de Vigo, Céltiga FC, or Fillos de Breogán. From the 1970s a series of Celtic music and cultural festivals were also popularized, being the most notable the \"Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta de Ortigueira\", at the same time that Galician folk musical bands and interpreters became usual participants in Celtic festivals elsewhere, as in the Interceltic festival of Lorient, where Galicia sent its first delegation already in 1976.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "210684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210684", "title": "Germaine de Staël", "text": "Germaine de Staël\n\nAnne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein (; née Necker; 22 April 176614 July 1817), commonly known as Madame de Staël, was a French woman of letters of Genevan origin whose lifetime overlapped with the events of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era. For many years she lived as an exile under the Reign of Terror and under Napoleonic persecution. Known as a witty and brilliant conversationalist, often dressed in flashy and revealing outfits, she participated actively in the political and intellectual life of her times. She was present at the first opening of the Estates General and at the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Her intellectual collaboration with Benjamin Constant between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of their time. They discovered sooner than others the tyrannical character and designs of Napoleon. In 1814 one of her contemporaries observed that \"there are three great powers struggling against Napoleon for the soul of Europe: England, Russia, and Madame de Staël\". Her works, both novels and travel literature, with emphasis on passion, individuality and oppositional politics made their mark on European Romanticism. \n\nGermaine (or \"Minette\") was the only child of the prominent Genevan banker and statesman Jacques Necker, who was the Director-General of Finance under King Louis XVI of France. Her mother was Suzanne Curchod, also of Swiss birth, who hosted in Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin one of the most popular salons of Paris. Mme Necker wanted to educate her daughter according to the principles of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and to endow her with the intellectual education and Calvinist discipline instilled in her by her pastor father. On Friday she habitually brought Germaine as a young child to sit at her feet in her salon, where the guests took pleasure in stimulating the brilliant child. At the age of thirteen, she read Montesquieu, Shakespeare, Rousseau and Dante. This exposure occasioned a nervous breakdown in adolescence, but the seeds of a literary vocation had been sown.\n\nHer father \"... is remembered today for taking the unprecedented step in 1781 of making public the country’s budget, a novelty in an absolute monarchy where the state of finances had always been kept a secret.\" Leading to his dismissal in May, the family eventually took up residence in 1784 at Château Coppet, an estate her father purchased on Lake Geneva. The family returned to the Paris region in 1785, and Mlle Necker continued to write miscellaneous works, including the three-act romantic drama \"Sophie\" (1786) and the five-act tragedy, \"Jeanne Grey\" (1787).\n\nAt the age of eleven, Germaine proposed to marry Edward Gibbon, who was fancied by her mother. Then he would always be around for her. In 1783, she was courted by William Pitt the Younger and by the fop Comte de Guibert, whose conversation, she thought, was the most far-ranging, spirited and fertile she had ever known. When she did not accept their offers Germaine's parents became impatient. Finally, a marriage was arranged with Baron Erik Magnus Staël von Holstein, an attaché of the Swedish legation to France. It took place on 14 January 1786 in the Swedish embassy at 97, Rue du Bac; Germaine was 20, her husband 37. On the whole, the marriage seems to have been acceptable to both parties, although neither seems to have had any or little affection for the other. The baron, a gambler, obtained great benefits as he received 80,000 pounds and was confirmed as lifetime ambassador to Paris, although his wife was almost certainly the more effective envoy.\n\nIn 1788, she published \"Letters on the works and character of J.J. Rousseau\". In this fervid panegyric, at first written for a limited number of friends (in which she accused his housekeeper Thérèse Levasseur of having been unfaithful), she demonstrated evident talent, but little in the way of critical discernment. De Staël was at this time enthusiastic about a mixture of Rousseau's ideas about love and Montesquieu in politics. In December 1788 her father instigated the king to double the number of deputies from the Third Estate in order to gain enough support for raising the taxes as the support the revolutionaries in America had been too costly. This approach had serious repercussions on Necker's reputation; he appeared to consider the Estates-General to be a facility designed to help the administration rather than to reform government. In an argument with the king, whose speech on 23 June he didn't attend, Necker was dismissed and exiled on 11 July. On Sunday, 12 July the news became public and an angry Camille Desmoulins suggested the storming of the Bastille. On 16 July he was reappointed; Necker entered the city in triumph. His efforts to clean up public finances were unsuccessful and his idea of a National Bank failed. Necker was attacked by Jean-Paul Marat and Count Mirabeau in the Constituante, when he did not agree with using assignats as legal tender. He resigned on 4 September 1790. Accompanied by their son-in-law, her parents left for Switzerland, without 2 million livres, half of his fortune, invested in the public treasury in 1778. \n\nThe increasing disturbances caused by the Revolution made her privileges as the consort of an ambassador very important safeguards. Germaine held a salon in the Swedish embassy, where she gave \"coalition dinners\", that were frequented by moderates such as Talleyrand and De Narbonne, monarchists (Feuillants) as Antoine Barnave, Charles Lameth and his brothers Alexandre and Théodore, the Comte de Clermont-Tonnerre, Pierre Victor, baron Malouet, the poet Abbé Delille, Thomas Jefferson, the one-legged Minister Plenipotentiary to France Gouverneur Morris, the leftish Paul Barras and the radical Condorcets. \"The issue of leadership, or rather lack of it, was central to Staël's preoccupations at this stage of her political reflection. The death of Comte de Mirabeau, a royalist, she experienced as a sign of great political disorientation and uncertainty. He was the only man with necessary charisma, energy, and prestige to keep revolutionary movement on the path of constitutional reform.\" \n\nAfter the French legislative election, 1791 was held, and the French Constitution of 1791 was announced in the National Assembly, she resigned from a political career and decided not to be re-eligible. \"Fine arts and letters will occupy my leisure.\" Though, in the succession of Comte de Montmorin the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the appointment of Narbonne as she played an important role and became the center of the stage. Marie Antoinette wrote to Hans Axel Fersen: \"Count Louis de Narbonne is finally Minister of War, since yesterday; what a glory for Mme de Staël and what a joy for her to have the whole army, all to herself.\"\nIn the year 1792 the French Legislative Assembly saw an unprecedented turnover of ministers, six ministers of the interior, seven ministers of foreign affairs, and nine ministers of war. On 10 August 1792 Clermont-Tonnere was thrown out of a window at the Louvre and trampled to death. De Staël offered Malouet a plan to escape for the royal family. She helped De Narbonne, dismissed for plotting, to hide under the altar in the chapel of the Swedish embassy, and then lectured the sans-culottes in the hall. \n\nOn Sunday 2 September, the day the Elections for the National Convention and the September massacres began, she fled her self in the style of an ambassadress. Her carriage was stopped and the crowd forced her to go to the Paris town hall, where Robespierre presided. Robespierre, as well as Marat were militant members of the Insurrectionary Commune who had got from the provisional, executive council, as there was no government \"... extensive police powers to detain, interrogate and incarcerate suspects without anything resembling due process of law.\" In the evening she was conveyed home, escorted by the procurator Louis Pierre Manuel. The next day the commissioner to the Commune of Paris Jean-Lambert Tallien arrived with a new passport and accompanied to the barrier.\n\nAfter her flight from Paris Germaine moved to Rolle where Albert was born. She was surrounded by De Montmorency and the Marquis de Jaucourt. In January 1793, she made a four months visit to England to live with her lover, the Comte de Narbonne at Juniper Hall. (Since 1 February France and Great Britain were at war.) Within a few weeks she got pregnant, apparently one of the reasons she caused a scandal in England. According to Fanny Burney her father urged his daughter to avoid De Staël and the group of French Émigres in Surrey. She met with Horace Walpole, James Mackintosh, Lord Sheffield, a friend of Edward Gibbon, and Lord Loughborough, the new Lord Chancellor. De Staël was not favourably impressed by the conditions of women in English society. Personal freedom was evidently as important to her as abstract political liberties.\n\nIn the summer of 1793, she returned to Coppet Castle perhaps while De Narbonne stopped loving her. She wrote a biased depiction of the character of queen, named \"Reflections on the Trial\". For De Staël France had to follow England's example from absolute to limited royalty. Living in Jouxtens-Mézery, Germaine was visited by Adolph Ribbing in July 1793. Count Ribbing was living in exile, after being sentenced for taking part in a conspiracy to murder the Swedish king Gustav III. Late 1793 her parents moved to Beaulieu Castle. In September 1794 she was visited by the divorced Benjamin Constant. In May 1795 she moved with her new \"colleague\" to Paris. De Staël had rejected the idea of the right of resistance - which had been introduced by the French Constitution of 1793, but removed from the Constitution of 1795. In 1796 she published \"Sur l'influence des passions\", in which she praised suicide; a book that attracted the attention of the German authors Schiller and Goethe. \n\nGermaine had also an obsession with French politics, and reopened her salon. It was during these years that Mme de Staël was of chief political importance. For a time she was conspicuous in the motley and eccentric society of the mid-1790s. On the 13 Vendémiaire the Comité de salut public ordered her to leave Paris after accusations of politicking, and locked up Constant for one night. Germaine spent that autumn in Forges-les-Eaux, a spa. She was trusted by neither side and a threat to political stability. The couple moved to Ormesson-sur-Marne where they lived with Montmorency. In Summer 1796 Constant founded \"Cercle constitutionnel\" in Luzarches; De Staël supported him. In May 1797 she was back in Paris and eight months pregnant. She succeeded in getting Talleyrand from the list of Émigrés and in July in his appointment as minister of Foreign Affairs. Since the coup of 18 Fructidor anyone wishing to restore the monarchy or the French Constitution of 1793 would be shot without a trial. Germaine moved to Saint-Ouen, on her father's estate and became friends with the beautiful and rich Juliette Récamier to whom she sold the parental house in the Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin. \n\nDe Staël completed the initial part of her first most substantial contribution to political and constitutional theory, \"Of present circumstances that can end the Revolution, and of the principles that must found the republic of France\". On 6 December 1797 at Talleyrand's office and 3 January 1798 during a ball she met with Napoleon. She made clear she did not agree with his planned French invasion of Switzerland. He showed no interest and would not read her letters. \n\nIn January 1800 Benjamin Constant was appointed by Napoleon as a member of the Tribunat but not long after he became the first consul's enemy. Two years later Napoleon Bonaparte forced him to withdraw because of the speeches that he thought were actually written by Mme de Staël. Both personal and political reasons threw her into opposition to Napoléon, in August 1802 elected as first consul for life. For De Staël Napoleon started to resemble \nMachiavelli; for Napoleon J.J. Rousseau was the cause of the French Revolution. It culminated when Jacques Necker had published his \"Last Views on Politics and Finance\" and his daughter \"De la littérature considérée dans ses rapports avec les institutions sociales\". It was her first philosophical approach to Europe, that dealt with such important factors as nationality, history and social institutions. Napoleon started a campaign against this publication. He did not like her cultural determinism and generalizations, in which she stated that \"an artist must be of his own time\". For him a woman should stick to knitting. He said about her, according to the Memoirs of Madame de Rémusat, that she \"teaches people to think who never thought before, or who had forgotten how to think.\" It became pretty clear that the first man in France and the De Staël were not likely to get on together. \n\nDe Staël published a provoking (anti-catholic) novel \"Delphine\", in which the \"femme incomprise\" (misunderstood woman) living in Paris between 1789 and 1792, is confronted with conservative ideas about divorce after the Concordat of 1801. In this tragic novel, influenced by Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" and Rousseau's \"Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse\", she reflects on the legal and practical aspects on divorce, the arrests and the September Massacres, and the fate of the émigrés. The main characters have traits of the flippant Benjamin Constant, and Talleyrand is depicted as an old woman, herself as the heroine with the liberalist view of the Italian aristocrat and politician Melzi d'Eril? \n\nWhen Constant moved to Maffliers in September 1803 De Staël went to see him and let Napoleon know she would be wise and careful. Immediately the house became very popular among her friends, but Napoleon, informed by Madame de Genlis suspected a conspiracy. \"Her extensive network of connections - which included foreign diplomats and known political opponents, as well as members of the government and of Bonaparte's own family - was in itself a source of suspicion and alarm for the government.\" Her protection of Jean Gabriel Peltier - who wished the death of Napoleon - influenced his decision on 13 October 1803 to exile her without a trial. For ten years De Staël was not allowed to settle within a distance of 40 leagues (almost 200 km) from Paris. She accused Napoleon of \"persecuting a woman and her children\". On 23 October she left for Germany \"out of pride\", in the hope to gain attention and to be able to return as soon as possible.\n\nWith her children and Constant she stopped off in Metz and met with Kant's translator Charles de Villers. In mid-December, they arrived in Weimar, where she stayed for two and a half months at the court of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and his mother Anna Amalia. Germaine was constantly on the move, talking and asking questions. Goethe, in fact, became ill and hesitated about seeing her. Schiller complimented her intelligence and eloquence, but her frequent visits distracted him from completing \"William Tell\". Constant decided to abandon her in Leipzig and return to Switzerland. De Staël traveled to Berlin, where she made the acquaintance of August Schlegel who was giving lectures on literature. She appointed him on an enormous salary as the private tutor to her children. On 18 April they all left Berlin when the news of her father's death reached her. \n\nOn 19 May she arrived in Coppet and found herself its wealthy and independent mistress, but her sorrow for her father was deep and certainly sincere. She spent the summer at the chateau arranging his writings and published an essay on his private life. In July Constant wrote: \"She exerts over everything around her a kind of inexplicable but very real power. If she could only govern herself, she might have governed the world.\" In December 1804 she travelled to Italy, accompanied by her children, Schlegel and the historian Sismondi. She met with the poet Monti and the painter, Angelica Kauffman. \"Her visit to Italy helped her to further develop her theory of the difference between northern and southern societies...\"\n\nShe returned to Coppet in June 1805, moved to Meulan (Château d'Acosta) and spent nearly a year writing her next book on Italy's culture and history. In \"Corinne, ou L'Italie\" (1807) the female hero appears to have been inspired by the Italian poet Diodata Saluzzo Roero. She showed all of Italy's works of art still in place, rather than plundered by Napoleon and taken to France. The book's publication acted as a reminder of her existence, and Napoleon sent her back to Coppet. Her house became, according to Stendhal, \"the general headquarters of European thought\" and was a debating club hostile to Napoleon, \"turning conquered Europe into a parody of a feudal empire, with his own relatives in the roles of vassal states\". Madame Récamier, also banned by Napoleon, Prince Augustus of Prussia, Charles Victor de Bonstetten, and Chateaubriand all belonged to the \"Coppet group\". Each day the table was laid for about thirty guests. Talking seemed to be everybody's chief activity. \n\nFor a time she lived with Constant in Auxerre (1806), Rouen (1807), Aubergenville (1807). Then she met with Friedrich Schlegel, whose wife Dorothea had translated \"Corinne\" into German. The use of the word Romanticism was invented by Schlegel, but spread more widely across France through its persistent use by Madame de Staël. Late in 1807 she set out for Vienna and visited Maurice O'Donnell. She was accompanied by her children and August Schlegel who held his famous lectures. In 1808 De Staël set to work on her book about Germany - a country that did not exist until Bismarck - in which she presented the idea of Germany as an ethical and aesthetic model and praised German literature and philosophy. The exchange of ideas and literary and philosophical conversations with Goethe, Schiller, and Wieland inspired de Staël to write one of the most influential books of the nineteenth century. \n\nPretending she wanted to emigrate to the US, de Staël was given permission to re-enter France. Looking around in Chaumont-sur-Loire de Staël moved into the Château de Chaumont (1810) owned by the heirs of Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, but then moved on onto Fossé and Vendôme. She was determined to publish \"De l'Allemagne\" in France, a book in which she called French political structures into question, so indirectly criticizing Napoleon busy promoting French culture and theatre. Constrained by censorship, she wrote the emperor a somewhat provocative and perhaps undignified letter. The minister of police Savary had emphatically forbidden the publication of her book as being “un-French\". In October 1810 de Staël was exiled again and had to leave France within three days. Also August Schlegel was ordered to leave Swiss Confederation as an enemy of the French literature. She found consolation in a wounded officer named Albert de Rocca, twenty-three years her junior, to whom she got engaged privately in 1811 and would marry him publicly in 1816.\n\nThe operations of the French imperial police in regard to Mme de Staël are rather obscure. She was at first left undisturbed, but by degrees, the chateau itself became a source of suspicion, and her visitors found themselves heavily punished. François-Emmanuel Guignard, De Montmorency and Mme Récamier were exiled for the crime of visiting her. She remained at home during the winter of 1811, planning to escape to England or Sweden with the manuscript. On 23 May 1812 she left Coppet almost secretly, and journeyed through Bern, Innsbruck and Salzburg on her way to Vienna, where she met with Metternich. There she obtained an Austrian passport up to the frontier, and after some trepidation and trouble, received a Russian passport in Brody. \n\nDuring Napoleon's invasion of Russia de Staël, her two children and Schlegel, journeyed through the Habsburg empire from Brno to Łańcut where Rocca, having deserted the French army and having been searched by the French gendarmerie, was waiting for her. The journey continued to Lemberg, capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. On 14 July 1812 they arrived in Volhynia. In the meantime, Napoleon, who took a more northern route, had crossed the Niemen River with his army. In Kiev, she met Miloradovich, governor of the city. De Staël hesitated to travel to Odessa, Constantinople, and onto Greece, and decided instead to go north. In Moscow, she was invited by the governor Fyodor Rostopchin. She left only a few weeks before Napoleon arrived. Until the end of September, her party stayed in Saint Petersburg. She met twice with the tsar Alexander I of Russia who \"related to me also the lessons a la Machiavelli which Napoleon had thought proper to give him.\" For de Staël that was a vulgar and vicious theory. General Kutuzov sent her letters from the Battle of Tarutino and before the end of that year he would succeed in chasing the Grande Armée out of Russia. \n\nAfter four months of travelling, she arrived in Sweden. The crossing of the Bothnian Gulf by boat frightened her. In Stockholm she started \"Ten Years' Exile\", giving details of whom she had met and explained what she had seen. She never finished the manuscript and after eight months she set out for England, without August Schlegel who had been appointed as secretary to general Bernadotte. (She supported Bernadotte as new ruler of France, who she hoped would introduce a constitutional monarchy.) In London she received a great welcome. She met with Lord Byron on the first evening (27 May). The next day they dined at Sir Humphry Davy's, the chemist and inventor. In the evening de Staël had made \"very\" long speeches, according to Byron. She preached English politics to the first of our English Whig politicians ... preached politics no less to our Tory politicians the day after.\" Her stay was marred by the death of her son Albert, who as a member of the Swedish army had fallen in a duel with a Cossack officer in Doberan as a result of a gambling dispute. In October John Murray published \"De l'Allemagne\" both in a French and English translation, in which she reflected on nationalism and suggested a re-consideration on cultural rather than on natural boundaries. In May 1814, after Louis XVIII had been crowned (Bourbon Restoration) she returned to Paris. She undertook \"Considérations sur la révolution française\", based on Part One of \"Ten Years' Exile\". Again her salon became a major attraction both for Parisians and foreigners.\n\nWhen news came of Napoleon's landing on the Côte d'Azur, between Cannes and Antibes, early in March 1815, she fled to Coppet, and never forgave Constant for approving of Napoleon's return. Although she had no affection for the Bourbons she succeeded in obtaining restitution for the loan Necker had made to the French state before the Revolution. In October, after the Battle of Waterloo, she set out for Italy, not only for the sake of her own health but for that of her second husband, Rocca, who was suffering from tuberculosis. In May her 19-year-old daughter Albertine married Victor, 3rd duc de Broglie in Livorno.\n\nThe whole family returned to Coppet in June, and Lord Byron a womanizer and a gambler in debt, left London in great trouble and frequently visited Mme de Staël during July and August. For Byron, she was Europe's greatest living writer, but ...with her pen behind her ears and her mouth full of ink\". \"Byron was particularly critical of de Staël's self-dramatizing tendencies...\" Byron was a supporter of Napoleon, but for de Staël \"Bonaparte was not only a man but a system...\" \"Napoleon imposed standards of homogeneity on Europe that is, French taste in literature, art and the legal systems, all of which de Staël saw as inimical to her cosmopolitan point of view.\" Byron wrote she was \"... sometimes right and often wrong about Italy and England - but almost always true in delineating the heart, which is of but one nation of no country, or rather, of all.\" \nDespite her increasing ill-health, she returned to Paris for the winter of 1816–17. Constant argued with de Staël who had asked him to pay off his debts to her. A warm friendship sprang up between Madame de Staël and the Duke of Wellington, whom she had first met in 1814, and she used her influence with him to have the size of the Army of Occupation greatly reduced. She had already become confined to her house at 40, rue des Mathurins, paralyzed since 21 February. She died on 14 July. Her deathbed conversion to Roman Catholicism, after reading Thomas a Kempis, surprised many, including Wellington, who remarked that while he knew that she was greatly afraid of death, he had thought her incapable of believing in the afterlife. Rocca survived her by little more than six months. \"Yet although she insisted to the Duke of Wellington that she needed politics in order to live, her attitude towards the propriety of female political engagement varied: at times she declared that women should simply be the guardians of domestic space for the opposite sex, while at others, that denying women access to the public sphere of activism and engagement was an abuse of human rights. This paradox partly explains the persona of the “homme-femme” she presented in society, and it remained unresolved throughout her life.\"\n\nAlbertine Necker de Saussure, married to her cousin, wrote her biography in 1821, published as part of the collected works. Auguste Comte included Mme de Staël in his \"Calendar of Great Men\". Her political legacy has been generally identified with a stern defence of \"liberal\" values: equality, individual freedom and the limitation of power by constitutional rules. Comte's disciple Frederic Harrison wrote about de Staël that her novels \"precede the works of Walter Scott, Byron, Mary Shelley, and partly those of Chateaubriand, their historical importance is great in the development of modern Romanticism, of the romance of the heart, the delight in nature, and in the arts, antiquities, and history of Europe.\"\n\nBeside two daughters, Gustava Sofia Magdalena (born July 1787) and Gustava Hedvig (died August 1789), who died in infancy, she had two sons, Ludwig August (1790–1827), Albert (November 1792–July 1813), and a daughter, Albertine, Baroness de Staël von Holstein (June 1797–1838). It is believed Louis, Comte de Narbonne-Lara was the father of Ludvig August and Albert, and Benjamin Constant the father of red-haired Albertine. With Albert de Rocca, de Staël then aged 46, had one son, the disabled Louis-Alphonse de Rocca (April 1812–1842), who would marry Marie-Louise-Antoinette de Rambuteau, daughter of Claude-Philibert Barthelot de Rambuteau, and granddaughter of De Narbonne. Even as she gave birth, there were fifteen people in her bedroom. \n\nAfter the death of her husband, Mathieu de Montmorency became the legal guardian of her children. Like August Schlegel he was one of her intimates until the end of her life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "66859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66859", "title": "Gudrun Ensslin", "text": "Gudrun Ensslin\n\nGudrun Ensslin (; 15 August 1940 – 18 October 1977) was a founder of the West German far-left militant group Red Army Faction (\"Rote Armee Fraktion\", or RAF, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang). After becoming involved with co-founder Andreas Baader, Ensslin was influential in the politicization of Baader's anarchistic beliefs. Ensslin was perhaps the intellectual head of the RAF. She was involved in five bomb attacks, with four deaths, was arrested in 1972 and died on 18 October 1977 in what has been called Stammheim Prison's \"Death Night\".\n\nEnsslin, the fourth of seven children, was born in the village of Bartholomä in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Her father, Helmut, was a pastor of the Evangelical Church in Württemberg. Ensslin was a well-behaved child who did well at school and enjoyed working with the Protestant Girl Scouts, and doing parish work such as organizing Bible studies. In her family, the social injustices of the world were often discussed, and Gudrun is said to have been sensitized to social problems in West Germany and the world as a whole.\n\nAt age eighteen, Ensslin spent a year in the United States, where she attended high school in Warren, Pennsylvania. She graduated in the Honor Group at Warren High School in 1959. After returning home, she finished the remaining requirements for her German secondary education.\n\nLike her partner Bernward Vesper and other members of the Red Army Faction (such as Ulrike Meinhof and Horst Mahler) Ensslin had excellent exam scores and received a scholarship from the German National Academic Foundation. Studying at the University of Tübingen, she read education, English Studies, and German studies. Gudrun Ensslin also met Bernward Vesper in February, 1962.\n\nVesper's father Will had been a best-selling author before the First World War and joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis) in 1931. The senior Vesper kept a pro-Nazi stance until his death in 1962. The son's life was largely shaped by his father's experiences. Ensslin's politics harmonized with those of the Vespers, and the couple made a failed attempt to publish a collection of the senior Vesper's works .\n\nIn Tübingen, together with two other students, Ensslin and Vesper organized a student workshop for new literature which led to a shoestring publishing business called \"Studio neue Literatur\". The first book produced was an anthology of poems against atomic weapons, with many well-known poets from all German-speaking countries as well as a bilingual edition of poems by Gerardo Diego. In 1963–1964, Gudrun Ensslin earned her elementary school teacher's diploma. In the summer of 1964, the couple moved to West Berlin where Gudrun began her thesis on Hans Henny Jahnn at the Free University.\n\nIn 1965, Gudrun's younger sister Johanna married Günter Maschke, then a revolutionary Marxist poet and member of the Situationist International group Subversive Aktion, which included Rudi Dutschke as a member. Maschke is now a leading conservative antidemocratic intellectual and editor of Carl Schmitt. Later that year, Gudrun and Bernward were engaged to be married. Both were active on the democratic left-wing, they had well-paid jobs working for the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The couple demonstrated together against new security laws, the Vietnam War, an Allied Powers arms show, and for the right to demonstrate. Vesper neglected his studies, read voraciously, and in 1966 published, with a group of friends, a serious and important series of pamphlets and paperbacks, the \"Voltaire Flugschriften\". In May 1967, Ensslin gave birth to their son Felix Robert Ensslin.\n\nIn July or August 1967 Gudrun met Andreas Baader and they soon began a love affair. Baader had come to Berlin in 1963, to escape ongoing troubles with the Munich justice system and also to avoid conscription. The young criminal who drifted in and out of youth detention centers and prison soon became the man of Ensslin's life. In February 1968, Ensslin broke up with Vesper by phone, informing him that the relationship was already finished before Felix was born. An artifact from this time is an experimental film Ensslin participated in entitled \"Das Abonnement\" (\"The Subscription\").\n\nIn June 1967, Ensslin participated in political protests against the Shah of Iran during his visit to Germany. Though Western governments viewed the Shah as a reformer, his regime has been criticized for oppression, brutality, corruption, and extravagance. In what started as a peaceful demonstration at Deutsche Oper Berlin, fights broke out between pro-Shah and anti-Shah factions and an innocent young man by the name of Benno Ohnesorg was fatally shot in the back of the head by a police officer. The police officer, Karl-Heinz Kurras, was revealed in 2009 to be an undercover Stasi (East German State Security) agent. That night, Ensslin angrily denounced West Germany as a fascist state at a Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund meeting. Also, Berlin's own urban guerrilla organization, Movement 2 June, named itself after this event.\n\nKurras was charged with manslaughter and acquitted of the charge on 23 November 1967, which caused public outrage. Matters eventually cooled, which enraged Gudrun Ensslin. She had left Bernward Vesper and her child for good early in 1968 and now she, Andreas Baader and Thorwald Proll decided to escalate the fight against the system. They left Berlin around 20 March, and in Munich decided to fire-bomb department stores in Frankfurt, where a Socialist German Student Union congress was taking place. Together with Horst Söhnlein, they left for Frankfurt on 1 April.\n\nOn the night of 2 April 1968, two fires were set in two department stores in Frankfurt. Baader, Ensslin, Proll and Söhnlein remained in Frankfurt and were arrested three days later. In October 1968, they were sentenced to three years in prison for arson. After being released pending an appeal in June 1969, Baader, Ensslin and Proll fled when the appeal was denied. Baader was arrested on 3 April 1970. Ensslin, Ulrike Meinhof, who was at that time a well-known leftist journalist, and two other women freed him on 14 May 1970. One person was wounded. This was the beginning of the gang's violent actions, and the Red Army Faction. Ensslin became one of the most wanted people in Germany.\n\nIn May 1971, Bernward Vesper committed suicide and Felix was sent to live with foster parents.\n\nEnsslin was arrested in a boutique on 8 June 1972 in Hamburg.\n\nThe Red Army Faction's second generation made several attempts to free Ensslin and her comrades from prison. One attempt involved the kidnapping of Hanns-Martin Schleyer on 5 September 1977, and a proposed prisoner exchange. When this failed to work, the RAF orchestrated the hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner on 17 October. After the airplane was stormed by a German anti-terrorist unit, Schleyer was killed.\n\nHours later, in a night that became known as \"Death Night\", Ensslin, Baader and Jan-Carl Raspe were found dead in the high security block of Stammheim Prison. Like Meinhof, Ensslin was found dead by hanging in her cell. Andreas Baader and Jan-Carl Raspe were found shot. A fourth member, Irmgard Möller, allegedly stabbed herself four times in the chest with a stolen knife. She recovered from her wounds and has since stated that the deaths were not suicides, but extrajudicial killings undertaken by the German government of the time, a claim strongly denied by the German governments former and present. One exhaustive study of the RAF by Stefan Aust (revised in 2009 as \"Baader-Meinhof: the inside story of the RAF\") seconds the state’s official ruling that the deaths were suicides. On 27 October 1977, Ensslin was buried in a common grave with Baader and Raspe in the Dornhalde Cemetery in Stuttgart.\n\nIn 1981, Margarethe von Trotta's feature film \"Marianne and Juliane\" presented a fictionalised portrayal of an incarcerated Ensslin (Barbara Sukowa) and her sister (Jutta Lampe). Five years later, Sabine Wegner played Ensslin in Reinhard Hauff's \"Stammheim\", a detailed account of the terror trial against Ensslin, Baader, Meinhof and others. Also in 1986, Corinna Kirchhoff played Ensslin in Markus Imhoof's \"The Journey\", based on the memoirs of Enssslin's companion Bernward Vesper. In 1997, Anya Hoffmann was Ensslin in Heinrich Breloer's award winning TV docudrama \"Todesspiel\". Ensslin was portrayed by Johanna Wokalek in Uli Edel's 2008 film \"The Baader Meinhof Complex\", an adaptation of the non-fiction book of the same name by Stefan Aust. Wokalek's performance in the film was rewarded with a nomination for the 2009 German Film Awards and a Bambi award as best German actress. The film was chosen as Germany's submission to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, and was already nominated Best Foreign Language Film for the 66th Golden Globe Awards.\n\nIn February 2011, Andres Veiel's feature film \"Wer wenn nicht wir\" (\"If Not Us, Who?\"), in which Lena Lauzemis plays Gudrun Ensslin, won the Alfred Bauer Prize and the Prize of the German Art House Cinemas at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nEnsslin also appears as a character in Elfriede Jelinek's Ulrike Maria Stuart.\n\n\n\n"}

His father had been an agent for James VI of Scotland and was granted a large amount of land in Ireland following James' accession to the English throne.\n\nClanbrassil sat in the Irish House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Down between 1634 and 1635. Upon the outbreak of the civil war in England, he raised a regiment of foot and a troop of horse in support of Charles I. The force was maintained for eight years at Clanbrassil's own expense. He succeeded to his father's viscountcy in 1644. Following the defeat of the king by the forces of Parliament, Clanbrassil's estates were seized by Oliver Cromwell. On 7 June 1647, Charles I created him Earl of Clanbrassil in the Peerage of Ireland in recognition for his service. Clanbrassil was one of a number of Protestant Royalists who were allowed to return to their estates under The Protectorate, and did so in 1654 in return for a payment of £9,435. He was succeeded by his second son.\n\nIn 1638 he was betrothed to Lady Mary Boyle, the 13-year-old daughter of The 1st Earl of Cork. The marriage, however, never took place, as Mary, despite intense pressure from her formidable father, absolutely refused to marry him, on the unflattering ground that she found him physically repulsive. This defiance of a father's wishes, particularly in such a young girl, was almost unprecedented at the time. Mary, however, was noted from an early age for her extraordinary strength of character. Even her father ruefully admitted that he was unable to control \"my unruly daughter\", and since he was genuinely fond of her he let the betrothal lapse.\n\nOn 23 Sep 1641, he married Lady Anne Carey.

Louis Coussan, was a professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the dean of the college of education there. His grandmother, Mary B. Coussan, taught for the Lafayette Parish School Board. His father, Dr. George Coussan, a radiologist, quarterbacked the ULL Ragin' Cajuns, when the team played in the Grantland Rice Bowl in Baton Rouge in 1970. His mother, the former Jo Ellen Becnel, is a real estate broker for Van Eaton & Romero in Lafayette. Coussan and his wife, Jennifer Joy, have three children, and attend Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church in Lafayette.\n\nCoussan graduated from the Catholic-affiliated St. Thomas More High School in Lafayette and then Louisiana State University and the Louisiana State University Law Center, both in Baton Rouge.\n\nA partner at the Lafayette real estate law firm, Andrus Boudreaux Complete Title, Coussan also co-founded Cougar Constructione.

His other affiliations include the Chamber of Commerce, the Acadian Homebuilders Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nCoussan won his seat in a runoff election held on November 21, 2015, over fellow Republican Andre' Comeaux. The two had emerged as the top two candidates from the October 24 primary election in which a third contender, Republican Jan Swift, was eliminated from further consideration.\n\nIn his freshman term, Coussan has proved to be a competent negotiator in the Legislature, often working behind the scenes to affect change. He was part of the \"Gang of Eight\" as described by political columnist Jeremy Alford, who led the charge in 2016 to elect Taylor Barras as the first independent Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, bucking the tradition of supporting the governor's chosen leader. Later that same year, Coussan was among the \"Gang of No\" who voted repeatedly against proposed tax increases and other tax measures pushed by then newly-installed Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, working instead on compromise legislation to put a temporary sales tax increase in place set to expire in 2018, providing time to craft long-term fiscal reform to the state budget.\n\nAs a result of these and other voted during a series of special legislative sessions in his first year in office, Coussan was ranked the 12th most conservative member of the legislature by the American Conservative Union in 2016, which ranked legislators who vote \"most consistently with the ideals articulated in the U.S. Constitution: limited transparent government, individual rights, personal responsibility, and lasting cultural values.\"\n\nHe was named a \"Business Champion\" at the Chamber SWLA's annual LegisGator Awards in 2016 and 2017.

Officer Basnett had stopped at a service station at the Kelly Highway exit in Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Swindler also stopped there in a stolen car with a South Carolina license plate. Swindler was returning to Leavenworth, Kansas to settle some personal grudges that had arisen when he had been imprisoned there. Passing the I-540 exit on I-40 near Van Buren, Arkansas, the illiterate Swindler became confused and exited, driving across the Arkansas River and into Fort Smith. That morning, Basnett had been briefed to be on the lookout for Swindler, who was the suspect in the double murders of teenagers Gregory L. Becknell and Dorothy Ann Rhodes in South Carolina and other felonies in Georgia and South Carolina. The briefing contained information about Swindler's description, the car he was thought to be driving, and the fact that he was considered to be armed and dangerous. After he noted Swindler and the stolen car, Basnett radioed dispatchers that Swindler was at the service station. Back-up officers were immediately dispatched to his location.\n\nBefore additional help arrived, officer Basnett approached Swindler's car and asked for identification. Without warning, Swindler pulled a revolver and shot Basnett twice in the chest. Basnett, who was standing beside the car, returned fire before collapsing, slightly wounding Swindler. Swindler attempted to flee, but being unfamiliar with Fort Smith, took a road that trailed off into a dead end in a soybean field on the Arkansas River. He was captured there within minutes by police officers who had answered Basnett's call. When officers arrested Swindler, he had several weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his possession. \n\nOfficer Randy Basnett died in the ambulance on the way to Sparks Regional Medical Center.\n\nA legislative act in 1983 made lethal injection the only method of execution in Arkansas.

When Charles Laverne Singleton chose lethal injection, John Edward Swindler earned the distinction of being the last inmate to die in Arkansas' electric chair. \n\nSwindler refused to choose between lethal injection and the electric chair, according to the Arkansas Department of Correction. By not choosing, Swindler effectively selected electrocution. Warden David White said Swindler might have wanted the notoriety of being the last Arkansas inmate to die in the electric chair. His was also the only execution in the new electric chair constructed by the state in the 1970s.\n\nSwindler was the first person executed by the state of Arkansas since \"Furman v. Georgia\", , after new capital punishment laws were passed in Arkansas and that came into force on March 23, 1973.\n\nAfter the Swindler execution, electrocution was made available to inmates who chose it.

In 1979, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his \"incomparable achievements as a cinematic creator and innovator.\" He was nominated five times for a Best Director Oscar, and won eight international film awards during his career. Vidor's best known films include \"The Big Parade\" (1925), \"The Crowd\" (1928), \"Stella Dallas\" (1937), and \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946). He is not related to fellow director Charles Vidor.\n\nVidor was born in Galveston, Texas, the son of Kate (Wallis) and Charles Shelton Vidor, a lumberman. His grandfather, Károly (Charles) Vidor, was a refugee of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, who settled in Galveston in the early 1850s. He survived the great Galveston Hurricane of 1900. Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled \"Southern Storm\", for the May 1935 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine:\n\nI remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. I felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come pouring down upon us.\n\nA freelance newsreel cameraman and cinema projectionist, Vidor made his debut as a director in 1913 with \"The Grand Military Parade\". In Hollywood from 1915, he worked as a screenwriter and as director of a series of at least ten short juvenile-delinquency films for Judge Willis Brown before directing his first feature, \"The Turn in the Road\", in 1919. A successful mounting of \"Peg o' My Heart\" in 1922 won him a long-term contract with Goldwyn Studios (later to be absorbed into MGM). Three years later he made \"The Big Parade\", among the most acclaimed war films of the silent era, and a tremendous commercial success. This success established him as one of MGM's top studio directors for the next decade. In 1928, Vidor received his first Oscar nomination, for \"The Crowd\", widely regarded as his masterpiece and one of the greatest American silent films. In the same year, he made the classic \"Show People\", a comedy about the film industry starring Marion Davies (in which Vidor had a cameo as himself), and his much-loved screwball comedy \"The Patsy\", which also starred Davies and was his last silent film.\n\nVidor's first sound film was \"Hallelujah\", a groundbreaking film featuring an African-American cast. He had no difficulty adjusting to sound and he continued making feature films until the late 1950s. Some of his better known sound films include \"Stella Dallas\", \"Our Daily Bread\", \"The Citadel\", \"Duel in the Sun\", \"The Fountainhead\", and \"War and Peace\". He directed the Kansas sequences in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (including \"Over the Rainbow\" and the twister) when director Victor Fleming had to replace George Cukor on \"Gone with the Wind\", but did not receive screen credit.\n\nIn 1962, he was head of the jury at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1969 he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nVidor was entered in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for the longest career as a film director: beginning in 1913 with \"Hurricane in Galveston\" and ending in 1980 with \"The Metaphor\", a 36-minute documentary featuring the painter Andrew Wyeth. He was nominated five times for an Oscar but never won in direct competition; he received an honorary award in 1979.\n\nIn 1967, Vidor researched the unsolved 1922 murder of fellow director William Desmond Taylor for a possible screenplay. Vidor never published or wrote of this research during his lifetime, but biographer Sidney D. Kirkpatrick posthumously examined Vidor's notes. He alleged, in his 1986 book \"A Cast of Killers\", that Vidor had solved the sensational crime but kept his conclusions private to protect individuals still living at the time. The widely cited newsletter \"Taylorology\" later noted over 100 factual errors in \"Cast of Killers\" and strongly disputes Kirkpatrick's conclusions, but credits the book with renewing popular interest in the crime.\n\nIn 1944 Vidor, a Republican, joined the anti-communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals.\n\nVidor published his autobiography, \"A Tree is a Tree\", in 1953. This book's title is inspired by an incident early in Vidor's Hollywood career. Vidor wanted to film a movie in the locations where its story was set, a decision which would have greatly added to the film's production budget. A budget-minded producer told him, \"A rock is a rock. A tree is a tree. Shoot it in Griffith Park\" (a nearby public space which was frequently used for film exterior shots).\n\nKing Vidor was a Christian Scientist and wrote occasionally for church publications, such as \"The Bible\" and the hit, \"Truth Be Told.\"\n\nVidor was married three times:\n\nVidor died at age 88 of a heart ailment at his ranch in Paso Robles, California on November 1, 1982. His remains were cremated and scattered on the ranch property.\n\n\nAt the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema.\n\n"}

{"id": "14524997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14524997", "title": "List of Big Brother 6 housemates (UK)", "text": "List of Big Brother 6 housemates (UK)\n\nThis is a list of the housemates of sixth series, broadcast in 2005, of the UK version of \"Big Brother\", where they were observed by television viewers 24 hours a day, and each week one or more housemates were voted to be evicted by the general public until the winner, Anthony Hutton, was left.\n\nThere were sixteen housemates in total; thirteen housemates entered on day one and they were joined by three more on Day 29. They entered the \"Secret Garden\" which was decorated like a jungle, and the three secret housemates were initially only supplied with fig leaves to cover only the main essentials of their bodies. This created the idea of an Adam and Eve style jungle. With Makosi's help, they had to steal clothes and food from the main Big Brother House when the other housemates were asleep, and to make sure that the other housemates did not find out about them. At the end of their stay, Makosi had to choose two of the three secret housemates to enter the main house. She chose Orlaith and Eugene, although Kinga re-entered the house after Orlaith walked out on Day 65.\n\nAnthony Hutton (born March 1982) is a 70s dancer and apprentice hairdresser from Consett in County Durham. Anthony won \"Big Brother 6\" with 57.2% of the vote, narrowly beating Eugene and walking away with £50,000.\n\nSince leaving the house Anthony experienced a taste of fame, but this was short-lived and, despite the occasional television or public appearance, Anthony has now returned to his home town and returned to normal life.\n\nAnthony became famous in the house for his variety of catchphrases, including \"alreet!\" (All right in his Geordie accent), \"Mint\" (meaning something is good), \"Let's get it on\", and shouting out \"Taxi\".\nAnthony and Makosi were often seen as a potential couple, after a drunken night in the pool they both claimed nothing sexual happened between them, however less than 48 hours later Makosi stated that she was pregnant with Anthony's baby, although she never told him this, she later claimed she received her period and that she was not pregnant. On the final night, third placed Makosi told Davina McCall that she was telling the truth when she said she was pregnant, during Anthony's interview he looked shocked when McCall told him about Makosi's pregnancy claims and said that they never had sex, during this the crowd chanted 'Liar, Liar' at Makosi. However, the story has been backed up in print by Orlaith McAllister. Fellow housemate Maxwell believes they had sexual intercourse too, and Craig also thought this at the time, but later changed his story (it is not known when Craig changed his opinion on the matter), during Makosi's interview she said that she wouldn't believe what Craig is saying because \"he probably wanted to shag Anthony.\" Makosi sold her story to the \"News of the World\" and claimed she did have sex with Anthony. The same day the story went on sale, both contestants appeared on the BBLB Reunion show. During his interview, incensed at Makosi stating she could prove it whilst Anthony was being interviewed, Anthony shouted over to her \"You know you can't, you're an absolute liar!\" and had to be told to calm down by the show's presenter, Dermot O'Leary.\n\nDuring Anthony's stay in the house he became close with a fellow contestant, gay hairdresser Craig Coates; it was widely spread amongst the fellow contestants and the media that Craig was obsessing over Anthony and this caused him to be branded with the \"bunny boiler\" image on the outside. Upon his eviction from the house Craig was shocked that he had been branded a \"bunny boiler\" and refused to endorse it. Since leaving Big Brother, Anthony has refused to criticise Craig. Craig has said in a radio interview that he is no longer friends with Anthony, although their friendship was the butt of jokes in the 17 August 2006 edition of \"Big Brother's Little Brother\", where Anthony was a phone-in guest.\n\nAnthony appeared in the 2005 and 2006 series of Sky One's The Match producing credited appearances noticed by the Legends his Celebrity squad faced. But most notably by the viewers who voted him to receive the Man of the Match award in both series he has appeared in show.\n\nUpon leaving the house Anthony, like the vast majority of the other ex-housemates, received attention from the press and the public; this sustained Anthony as a celebrity for a short period of time, with Anthony making various public and television appearances, such as appearing on the Sky One reality television series, \"The Match\", and various photo shoots (some naked) for magazines and tabloid newspapers. Anthony also released a work-out video which revolved around his 70s disco dance movements; despite winning Big Brother, Anthony's work-out DVD failed to sell well.\n\nIn September 2007, he featured in the Sky TV production, \"Premier League All Stars\" football show representing Newcastle United.\n\nIn September 2010, Anthony re-entered the house for Ultimate Big Brother as part of the retrospective task. He had a date with ex housemate Makosi Musambasi.\n\nCraig Jonathan Coates (born October 1984) is a former hair stylist from Cromer, Norfolk. His two most recent hairdressing salons, one in Norwich, one in Cromer, have both failed financially.\n\nDuring his time in the house Craig immediately created 'Team Britney' along with Lesley and Vanessa. When Lesley was evicted on Day 15 Craig began to align himself with Anthony, Maxwell and Saskia. Craig then developed what was interpreted by the media as an unsettling obsession with Anthony, which resulted in several awkward moments.\n\nCraig finished fifth, and was evicted on Day 76 in a surprise final week eviction having received just 3.9% of the vote to win.\n\nHe has since been infamous for being recorded in a \"Leslie Grantham\" style video recorded on a web cam.\n\nHe has recently begun working at an MTS assistant at the Tate Gallery.\n\nDerek George Henry Laud (born 9 August 1964) is a lobbyist and businessman, with strong past links to the Conservative Party.\n\nThe last housemate to be evicted by the nomination process, he was voted out on Day 71 (5 August), receiving 58% of the vote against his friend Eugene. Kemal was a guest at Derek's 41st Birthday party a few days later, and has appeared on \"The Curse of Big Brother\" on Channel 5 and on BBC1's \"Test the Nation\" in the Reality Show Contestants panel alongside Eugene Sully on 27 August 2007.\n\nEugene Mark Sully (born 30 November 1977) is from Crawley in West Sussex. He attained a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Engineering in 2000 from the University of Sussex and helped manage the student radio station. Prior to his period in the \"Big Brother\" house, he worked as an engineer for Beat 106 (now Galaxy) in Scotland before becoming a Spectrum Planning Engineer for the BBC Research & Development department; he also unsuccessfully stood as a Labour Party candidate in Sussex prior to going into the \"Big Brother\" house. Although Eugene came second in \"BB6\", he emerged from the house £50,000 richer after being offered (and accepting) half of the prize fund in the final week.\n\nSince leaving the BB house, Sully has presented the breakfast show on Mercury FM (Surrey & Sussex) and appeared on \"Blue Peter\", \"Top of the Pops\" and the children's show \"Dick and Dom in da Bungalow\" as well as being a contestant on the BBC Two quiz show \"Eggheads\" with a team he called \"Eugenius\", he has also carried out interviews on various radio stations and also appeared on \"Brainiac: Test Tube Baby\" where he set up experiments and was judged and got 20 out of 30 (2006). He also appeared on Channel 4's \"8 Out Of 10 Cats: Big Brother Special\" in August 2006, August 2007, and September 2010.\n\nHe also attended an awards ceremony for the Closer magazine honouring gifted children last. He is a member of the IEE and a member of the Crawley Amateur Radio Club (his Amateur Radio callsign is G0VIQ). Eugene also holds a private pilot's licence and regularly flies out of Redhill.\n\nSully's mother, Janet, is a Labour Party, West Sussex County Councillor representing Bewbush, Gossops Green and Southgate in Crawley. In 2006, Sully stood in the council election for the ward of Furnace Green, Crawley, West Sussex, as a candidate for Labour, where he came second to the Conservative candidate.\n\nIn October 2008, Sully played a cameo role in the E4 horror series \"Dead Set\" as himself, alongside former housemates Makosi Musambasi, Kinga Karolczak and Saskia Howard-Clarke, during which he is eaten by a zombie Davina McCall.\n\nKemal Shahin (born 18 November 1985) is a Turkish Cypriot former student of English Literature, Cultural History and Drama at Liverpool John Moores University, who had auditioned for Pop Idol. She was also a bellydancer, having won awards for her dance in Turkey.\n\nAt the time of Big Brother's filming, she presented and identified as male, but she now identifies as female.\n\nShe was the thirteenth person to enter the Big Brother house (dressed in a red sari) and the ninth to leave (in a green sari) on 29 July, gaining 51.1% of the public vote.\n\nSince Big Brother, Shahin has featured in various magazines and newspapers, notably a high fashion shoot with Attitude Magazine, a masculine makeover with Now Magazine in 2006, where hse was given a total makeover and a story with New Magazine in March 2007, talking about being transgender.\n\nShahin appeared on Sky News in early 2006 with fellow contestant Makosi Musambasi which resulted in a heated discussion between the pair.\n\nShahin announced in February 2006 that she and ex-housemate Kinga were a couple, and even claimed \"Kinga is the only one for me.\" She confronted rumours that she was gay and said he wasn't - she was bisexual.\nShahin has starred in Pantomime twice since Big Brother, playing the Fairy God Diva both times. In 2005/06 Kemal played at the King's Theatre in Southsea, and in 2006/07 in Torquay and Runcorn respectively. In November 2006 Kemal launched the online accessories store missblingbaby.com, which was unsuccessful.\n\nShahin did Diaries for MSN UK on Big Brother in both 2007 and 2008, with a daily diary of thoughts and viewpoints on the show.\n\nShahin has become a notable figure in fashion since her appearance on Big Brother as a runway coach and model scout, having worked with various publications and designers. Shahin has also been a judge at various beauty pageants including Miss Universe UK 2008.\n\nShahin has since released the single \"Through With Love\", undergone sex reassignment surgery and now goes by the name Zulekya. She lives in LA, California.\n\nKinga Karolczak (; born 19 April 1985) is a half Polish, half Kuwaiti market researcher from London. She initially entered into the house through the Secret Garden with fellow newcomers Eugene and Orlaith. She is most famous for masturbating with a wine bottle in the garden. One of her first actions was to expose one of her 34FF breasts out of her bikini top. Makosi - who had received a secret mission to be the only original housemate to be aware of and interact between the two houses - chose Eugene and Orlaith to go into the main house over her.\n\nAfter Orlaith left the house, Kinga re-entered. During her relatively short stay in the house Kinga acted wildly. She developed a rather surprising bond with Derek, with each of them often singing serenades to one another, and Derek curiously fondling her breasts while the two were in the pool. Even though Kinga was only in the house for eleven days she etched herself into the public consciousness when she apparently masturbated using a wine bottle in the garden. She managed to receive more votes to win the show than fellow housemate Craig who was evicted during the final week after failing to receive enough votes to win the series, this secured Kinga a place in the final night. Kinga finished fourth and left on the final night. Kinga was signed up to an exclusive magazine deal rumoured to be worth a 6 figure sum.\nSince the house Kinga has featured in many newspaper and magazine articles. She has been a guest on shows including \"Trisha Goddard\", \"Big Brother's Little Brother\" and \"Big Brother's Big Mouth\", Friday and the \"Sunday Night Project\", \"The Charlotte Church Show\", \"Celebrity Moments\" and many more. In 2006 she played at the \"Celebrity World Cup Soccer Six Tournament\".

In summer 2007 she was the \"Big Brother\" columnist for the \"Daily Sport\" newspaper. In October 2008 she made a guest appearance on the E4 horror series \"Dead Set\", in a cameo as herself. Kinga since leaving the house has lost over 3 stone and is barely recognisable with her recent glamour modelling shots done with the News of the World calling her one of the sexiest Big Brother babes ever and is still regularly seen in the media.\n\nLesley Anne Sanderson (born 24 November 1985) was a sales assistant from Huddersfield. She was the second person to be evicted from the Big Brother house, on 10 June (Day 15), gaining 36% of the public vote, all housemates faced eviction in Week 2 as punishment for Vanessa's rule breaking, on this eviction night, housemates could hear the crowd cheering and booing their favourites and least favourites, Sanderson received the biggest boos, as viewers labelled her a bully. Whilst staying in the house she, along with Craig and Vanessa, were noted for bullying fellow housemate Sam, which angered housemates such as Anthony and Maxwell who both got involved in an argument with her over the way she was treating her. Despite getting told off for her nasty behaviour by Big Brother, she seemed genuinely shocked at hearing the crowd boo her on her eviction. In Autumn 2005, Sanderson was allegedly raped in a hotel in Leeds. Also she claims that since Big Brother she has struggled to cope with fame and developed a drinking problem.\n\nAfter leaving the Big Brother House, Sanderson embarked on a singing career, which failed. She was due to record a single called \"Hated\" and plans to write a book about her experiences. \"The People\" reported that she was paid £15,000 for Big Brother. Lesley now works as a counsellor.\n\nMakosi Musambasi (born 24 September 1980)\n\nIs now based in Africa having been deported from the United Kingdom in 2011. \n\nShe hosted charity events, conferences and entertainment events around Africa and attained a contract to air my chat show on Zimbabwe TV, a self pioneered contemporary, continent focused, inspirational programme called ‘Makosi Today’.

She claims to remember a past life in Atlantis and that she has been abducted by aliens seven times. She wanted to leave the house just hours after entering, however she soon began to enjoy her time in the house, formed friendships and celebrated her 31st birthday by having a witch themed party. She accused Saskia of having breast implants and had an explosive row with her over this, she spent the following day lying in bed, refusing to get up and wanting to leave, she also insulted most of her housemates - branding them 'wannabes' and 'scum of the earth', Makosi - as part of her secret mission - secretly nominated Mary as a favour. She was the first to be evicted, and branded Makosi a snake in the grass for nominating her.\n\nAfter Big Brother, Mary had aspirations to become an actress and later said that being a witch was a very minor part of her personality. For a period she was also reportedly homeless and living on the streets.\n\nShe has since embarked on a successful falafel selling business.\n\nMaxwell Trotter Ward (born 1981) is from Islington, North London and supports Arsenal Football Club. He was noted for his chirpy cockney attitude and catchphrase; \"off the hook\". In the house he maintained a good friendship with fellow housemate Anthony. He had a reputation for his disproportionate top lip, his bad breath and his pranks. In Week 2, when all housemates faced eviction, he, along with Saskia received the biggest cheers from the crowd. They would go on to have a relationship, they were both nominated for eviction in Week 5 and isolated themselves from a number of housemates, and were involved in several arguments that week. Maxwell was reprimanded by Big Brother for throwing water over Kemal after he accused them of 'trying to get a magazine deal.' He was the sixth evictee from the house, and left on 8 July, with 57% of the vote.\n\nOrlaith McAllister (born 26 April 1979) is a model from Belfast, Northern Ireland. She was runner up in the 1999 Miss Northern Ireland competition, losing out to Zöe Salmon. She entered the house on Day 29 and was directed to the Secret Garden with fellow new housemates Eugene and Kinga. Makosi chose Orlaith along with Eugene to enter the main house on Day 32. Orlaith was initially popular with housemates, she became known for allowing them to touch her surgically enhanced breasts, she was also involved in the infamous 'Poolnight' on Day 37. She became friends with Makosi and Vanessa, however they began bitching about her in Week 7, on Day 48, Makosi even threatened to have a cat fight with her whilst Kemal also made threats about her on the same night. Orlaith began to feel unhappy in the house and expressed her desire to leave, despite this, the public did not choose to evict her, On Day 50 the public chose Makosi and Vanessa as the least popular of the six housemates who faced eviction that week, this meant that Orlaith along with Eugene were the first ever late entrants to survive a public vote.\n\nOn Day 52, Kemal began to isolate her and had an argument with her in the living room. On Day 54, Orlaith had a massive row with Science, and broke down in tears, she was comforted by her arch enemy Derek, later that day both Orlaith and Science were told that the housemates had chosen both of them to face eviction, Orlaith pleaded with the public to vote her out, although later that week she told housemates that she didn't think she will go - it is possible this was just a ploy to prompt viewers to vote her out. She narrowly survived eviction against Science - who got evicted with 50.5% of the vote - in what is the closest eviction in the history of \"Big Brother\". Orlaith was also the only female of this series to survive an eviction vote against a male housemate - not counting Kinga and Makosi who survived a winning vote against Craig.\n\nOrlaith was given a secret mission on Day 59, in which she was given a vibrating device and had to give a hug to whoever was next to her when the device vibrated, however Makosi sussed her out, but Orlaith pretended she was given a phone as she was feeling so upset in the house. Later that week she was nominated for eviction against her rival Kemal, she survived him in another close vote (51.1%). When Kemal left the house he called Orlaith's bluff about wanting to leave, however the following morning (Day 65) she quit and was replaced by Kinga. She received a huge amount of media coverage after she left the house, appearing regularly in lads' mags and on Page 3.\n\nOrlaith gave birth to her first child, a daughter Eva in February 2007. She gave birth to her second child, a son Anthony in April 2009.\n\nRoberto Conte (born 1973 in Italy), is a former teacher, and since 1996, has lived in Liverpool.

He was also a Physical Education teacher at De La Salle Humanities College in Croxteth, Liverpool.\n\nHe is remembered for his fiery temper, most notably pouring food over Maxwell's head during a heated row. He was evicted from the Big Brother house on Day 29, after losing his head-to-head with Derek. He had previously faced public votes in Weeks 2 and 3, before his eviction in Week 4.\n\nRoberto now works as a teacher and is training to be a chiropractor.\n\nSamantha Leanne Heuston (born January 1982 in London, England) is a marketing student from Cheam in southwest London. Her time in the house is best remembered for her raunchy behaviour such as her choice of clothing, which mainly consisted of a bikini, the lapdance she performed for Anthony, her kiss with Makosi, telling Big Brother she was feeling horny and masturbating in a cardboard box. She also suffered continuous bullying by a number of housemates, mainly Lesley.\n\nShe was the third person to be evicted from the Big Brother House, when faced against Derek and Roberto. She received 59% of the public vote when she was voted out on 17 June (Day 22). On her eviction, someone in the crowd threw water at her. Davina conducted her interview in a bikini, attracting some complaints from viewers.\n\nSince leaving the Big Brother house, Heuston has had photo shoots in The \"News of the World\" newspaper and in men's magazines such as \"Nuts\", \"Maxim\" and \"Zoo\". She has also appeared on an episode of Italian \"Big Brother\" in the audience.\n\nShe has a small cameo in Brit flick \"Clubbing to Death\" playing a Cage Rage ring girl. The film stars Nick Moran, Huey Morgan, and Dave Courtney and was due out in 2007. Sam now works as a sales assistant in a large department store.\n\nSaskia Rose Howard-Clarke (born March 1982) is a \"promotions girl\" from London. She was the fifth evictee from the house, on 1 July with 71% of the public vote. Whilst in the house she formed a relationship with Maxwell and friendships with Anthony, Sam, and later on Craig.\n\nShe had two open heart surgery operations which left scars under her breasts. These scars were then used by Mary and Lesley as \"evidence\" that Saskia had had a boob job, which she denied. Saskia's breasts require a 34FF bra.\n\nSince leaving the house Saskia sustained a short career as a glamour model and regularly appeared in \"Nuts\" magazine.\nShe had been offered the part of 'Sigourney' in a remake of Chicken Park, but declined after finding out that her character has her blouse removed and breasts licked and tickled by a giant cockerel.\nSaskia and Maxwell continued their relationship after they left the house for a short while. It was reported in \"OK\" magazine in February 2007 that Maxwell and Saskia were no longer together and this was confirmed in May 2007 during a Channel 4 programme \"After They Were Housemates\", during which Maxwell confirmed that he was currently moving out after splitting up around six months before. She has a pet dog, a pug, named Arthur.\n\nIn October 2008, Saskia appeared in the E4 horror series \"Dead Set\", as a zombie version of herself.\n\nSaskia's eviction in Week 5 attracted more viewers than the launch show, pulling in 6.6m viewers, 0.6m up from the live launch's 6.0m.\n\nKieron \"Science\" Harvey (born 1982) is a music and self-styled \"entertainment entrepreneur\" from Chapeltown, Leeds. He has a band called \"Urban Productions\" and won a BBC Spotlight Award in 2005 nominated by local people in the Harehills area of Leeds for \"making a difference - no matter how simply - to the lives of other people\".\n\nVanessa McIntosh (born 1985) is a student from Croydon, south London. She was the seventh person to be evicted from the house on Day 50. Her eviction was unique, she did not take part in nominations in Week 7 as Big Brother told them that nominations - which are usually compulsory - would be optional that week. The housemates who did nominate were told that they faced eviction, however they didn't, on eviction night Makosi and Vanessa received the most public votes - Makosi (47%), Vanessa (26%) - the housemates had to choose which one to evict, all except for Kemal chose to evict Vanessa.\n"}

{"id": "261396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261396", "title": "Man in the Iron Mask", "text": "Man in the Iron Mask\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask (French: \"L'Homme au Masque de Fer\"; c. 1640 – 19 November 1703) is the name given to an unidentified prisoner who was arrested in 1669 or 1670 and subsequently held in a number of French prisons, including the Bastille and the Fortress of Pignerol (modern Pinerolo, Italy). He was held in the custody of the same jailer, Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars, for a period of 34 years. He died on 19 November 1703 under the name \"Marchioly\", during the reign of King Louis XIV of France (1643–1715). Since no one ever saw his face because it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, the true identity of the prisoner remains a mystery; it has been extensively debated by historians, and various theories have been expounded in numerous books and films.\n\nAmong the leading theories are those proposed by writer and philosopher Voltaire: he claimed in the second edition of his \"Questions sur l'Encyclopédie\" (1771) that the prisoner wore a mask made of iron rather than of cloth, and that he was the older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. What little is known about the historical Man in the Iron Mask is based mainly on correspondence between Saint-Mars and his superiors in Paris. Recent research suggests that his name might have been \"Eustache Dauger\", a man who was involved in several political scandals of the late 17th century, but this assertion still has not been completely proven.\n\nThe National Archives of France has made available (online) the original data relating to the inventories of the goods and papers of Saint-Mars (one inventory, of 64 pages, was drawn up at the Bastille in 1708; the other, of 68 pages, at the citadel of Sainte-Marguerite in 1691). These documents have been sought in vain for more than a century and were thought to have been lost. They were discovered in 2015, among the 100 million documents of the . They show that some of the 800 documents in the possession of the jailer Saint-Mars were analysed after his death. These documents confirm the reputed avarice of Saint-Mars, who appears to have diverted the funds paid by the king for the prisoner. They also give a description of a cell occupied by the masked prisoner, which contained only a sleeping mat, but no luxuries, as was previously thought. With the scientific support of the National Library of France collections of ancient textiles, the accuracy of these notary documents discovered in 2015 has allowed the creation of the first virtual reconstruction of the prison of the man in the iron mask.\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask has also appeared in many works of fiction, most prominently in the late 1840s by Alexandre Dumas. A section of his novel \"\", the final installment of his D'Artagnan saga, features the Man in the Iron Mask. Here the prisoner is forced to wear an iron mask and is portrayed as Louis XIV's identical twin. Dumas also presented a review of the popular theories about the prisoner extant in his time in the chapter \"L'homme au masque de fer\" in the sixth volume of his non-fiction \"Crimes Célèbres\".\n\nThe earliest surviving records of the masked prisoner are from late July 1669, when Louis XIV's minister, the Marquis de Louvois, sent a letter to Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars, governor of the prison of Pignerol, which at the time was part of France. In his letter, Louvois informed Saint-Mars that a prisoner named \"Eustache Dauger\" was due to arrive in the next month or so.\nLouvois instructed Saint-Mars to prepare a cell with multiple doors, one closing upon the other, which were to prevent anyone from the outside listening in. Saint-Mars himself was to see Dauger only once a day to provide food and whatever else he needed. Dauger was also to be told that if he, Dauger, spoke of anything other than his immediate needs he would be killed, but, according to Louvois, the prisoner should not require much since he was \"only a valet\".\n\nHistorians have noted that the name Eustache Dauger was written in a handwriting different from that used in the rest of the letter's text, suggesting that a clerk wrote the letter under Louvois' dictation, while someone else, very likely Louvois himself, added the name afterward.\n\nDauger was arrested by Captain Alexandre de Vauroy, garrison commander of Dunkirk, and taken to Pignerol, where he arrived in late August. Evidence has been produced to suggest that the arrest was actually made in Calais and that not even the local governor was informed of the event – Vauroy's absence being explained away by his hunting for Spanish soldiers who had strayed into France via the Spanish Netherlands.\n\nThe first rumours of the prisoner's identity (specifically as a Marshal of France) began to circulate at this point. According to many versions of the legend, the prisoner wore the mask at all times.\n\nThe prison at Pignerol, like the others at which Dauger was later held, was used for men who were considered an embarrassment to the state and usually held only a handful of prisoners at a time.\n\nSaint-Mars' other prisoners at Pignerol included Count Ercole Antonio Mattioli, an Italian diplomat who had been kidnapped and jailed for double-crossing the French over the purchase of the important fortress town of Casale on the Italian border. There was also Nicolas Fouquet, Marquis of Belle-Île, a former superintendent of finances who had been jailed by Louis XIV on the charge of embezzlement, and the Marquis de Lauzun, who had become engaged to the Duchess of Montpensier, a cousin of the King, without the King's consent. Fouquet's cell was above that of Lauzun.\n\nIn his letters to Louvois, Saint-Mars describes Dauger as a quiet man, giving no trouble, \"disposed to the will of God and to the king\", compared to his other prisoners, who were either always complaining, constantly trying to escape, or simply mad.\n\nDauger was not always isolated from the other prisoners. Wealthy and important ones usually had manservants; Fouquet for instance was served by a man called La Rivière. These servants, however, would become as much prisoners as their masters and it was thus difficult to find people willing to volunteer for such an occupation. Since La Rivière was often ill, Saint-Mars applied for permission for Dauger to act as servant for Fouquet. In 1675, Louvois gave permission for such an arrangement on condition that he was to serve Fouquet only while La Rivière was unavailable and that he was not to meet anyone else; for instance, if Fouquet and Lauzun were to meet, Dauger was not to be present.\n\nIt is an important point that the man in the mask served as a valet. Fouquet was never expected to be released; thus, meeting Dauger was no great matter, but Lauzun was expected to be set free eventually, and it would have been important not to have him spread rumours of Dauger's existence. Historians have also argued that 17th-century protocol made it unthinkable that a man of royal blood would serve as a manservant, casting some doubt on speculation that Dauger was in some way related to the king.\n\nAfter Fouquet's death in 1680, Saint-Mars discovered a secret hole between Fouquet and Lauzun's cells. He was sure that they had communicated through this hole without detection by him or his guards and thus that Lauzun must have been made aware of Dauger's existence. Louvois instructed Saint-Mars to move Lauzun to Fouquet's cell and to tell him that Dauger and La Rivière had been released. In fact, they were held in another cell in another part of the prison, their presence there being highly secret.\n\nLauzun was freed in 1681. Later that same year, Saint-Mars was appointed governor of the prison of the Exiles Fort (now Exilles in Italy). He went there, taking Dauger and La Rivière with him. La Rivière's death was reported in January 1687; in May, Saint-Mars and Dauger moved to Sainte-Marguerite, one of the Lérins Islands, half a mile offshore from Cannes.\n\nIt was during the journey to Sainte-Marguerite that rumours spread that the prisoner was wearing an iron mask. Again, he was placed in a cell with multiple doors.\n\nOn 18 September 1698, Saint-Mars took up his new post as governor of the Bastille prison in Paris, bringing Dauger with him. He was placed in a solitary cell in the prefurnished third chamber of the Bertaudière tower. The prison's second-in-command, de Rosarges, was to feed him. Lieutenant du Junca, another officer of the Bastille, noted that the prisoner wore \"a mask of black velvet\".\n\nThe masked prisoner died on 19 November 1703 and was buried the next day under the name of \"Marchioly\". All of his furniture and clothing was reportedly destroyed afterward, the walls of his cell were scraped and whitewashed, and everything of metal which the man had possessed or used was melted down.\n\nIn 1711, King Louis's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine, sent a letter to her aunt, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, stating that the prisoner had \"two musketeers at his side to kill him if he removed his mask\". She described him as very devout, and stated that he was well treated and received everything he desired. However, the prisoner had already been dead for eight years by that point and the Princess had not necessarily seen him for herself; rather, she was quite likely reporting rumours she had heard at court.\n\nThe fate of the mysterious prisoner – and the extent of the apparent precautions his jailers took – created significant interest in his story and gave birth to many legends. Many theories exist and several books have been written about the case. Some were presented after the existence of the letters was widely known. Still later commentators have presented their own theories, possibly based on embellished versions of the original tale.\n\nTheories about his identity popular during his time included that he was a Marshal of France; the English Henry Cromwell, son of Oliver Cromwell; or François, Duke of Beaufort. Later, many people such as Voltaire and Alexandre Dumas suggested other theories about the man in the mask.\n\nIt has even been suggested that he was one of the other famous contemporary prisoners being held at Pignerol at the same time as Dauger.\n\nVoltaire claimed that the prisoner was a son of Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin, and therefore an illegitimate half-brother of King Louis XIV. However, the sincerity of this claim is uncertain.\n\nIn his history essay \"Le Masque de fer\", French novelist Marcel Pagnol, supporting his theory in particular on the circumstances of King Louis XIV's birth, claims that the Man in the Iron mask was indeed a twin but born second, and hence the younger, and would have been hidden in order to avoid any dispute over the throne holder.\n\nThe historians who reject this theory (including ), highlight the conditions of childbirth for the queen. It took place usually in public, in front of the main court's figures. But according to Marcel Pagnol, right after the birth of the future Louis XIV, King Louis XIII took his whole court to the \"Château de Saint-Germain\"'s chapel to celebrate a \"Te Deum\" in great pomp, in contrast to the common practice of celebrating it several days before childbirth. That would have allowed the queen to be left alone with her midwife to give birth to the second child.\n\nTo make the context clearer, it should be remembered that there was a controversy at that time over which one of twins was the elder: the one born first or the one who, being born second, would have, as was then thought, been conceived first. In such a situation, the reigning twin would face a serious threat to his throne.\n\nAlso supporting the theory of King Louis XIV's twin, a thorough examination of the French Kings' genealogy shows many twin births, in the Capetian dynasty, as well as in the House of Valois, Bourbon and lastly the House of Orléans.\n\nAlexandre Dumas explored a similar theory in his book \"The Vicomte de Bragelonne\", where the prisoner was instead an identical twin of Louis XIV. This book has served as the basis – even if loosely adapted – for many film versions of the story.\n\nAccording to Marcel Pagnol’s theory, this twin was then born in 1638, grew up on Jersey Island, being named James de la Cloche. Later he would have conspired against King Louis XIV besides Roux de Marcilly, and would have been arrested in Calais in 1669 further to the execution of Roux, who would have denounced him when being tortured.\n\nHugh Ross Williamson argues that the man in the iron mask was the natural father of Louis XIV. According to this theory, the \"miraculous\" birth of Louis XIV in 1638 would have come after Louis XIII had been estranged from his wife Anne of Austria for 14 years. Furthermore, Louis XIII was old, weak, ill, and not expected to live much longer, and thus may have been impotent at the time, implying that he was not the father.\n\nThe theory then suggests that the King's minister, Cardinal Richelieu, had arranged for a substitute, probably an illegitimate son or grandson of Henry IV, to become intimate with the queen and father an heir in the king's stead. At the time, the heir presumptive was Louis XIII's brother Gaston, Duke of Orléans, who was Richelieu's enemy. If Gaston became King, Richelieu would quite likely have lost both his job as minister and his life, and so it was in his best interests to thwart Gaston's ambitions. Louis XIII also hated Gaston and might thus have agreed to the scheme; the queen would have had the same interest, as Gaston would have removed her from any influence.\n\nSupposedly the substitute father then left for the Americas but in the 1660s returned to France with the aim of extorting money for keeping his secret, and was promptly imprisoned. This theory would explain both the secrecy surrounding the prisoner, whose true identity would have destroyed the legitimacy of Louis XIV's claim to the throne had it been revealed, and also - because of the King's respect for his own father - his comfortable imprisonment and why he was not simply killed.\n\nThis theory was first disputed by British politician Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood. He said the idea has no historical basis and is hypothetical. Williamson held that to say it is a guess with no solid historical basis is merely to say that it is like every other theory on the matter, although it makes more sense than any of the other theories. There is no known evidence that is incompatible with it, even the age of the prisoner, which Cecil had considered a weak point; and it explains every aspect of the mystery.\n\nIn 1890, Louis Gendron, a French military historian, came across some coded letters and passed them on to Étienne Bazeries in the French Army's cryptographic department. After three years Bazeries managed to read some messages in the Great Cipher of Louis XIV. One of them referred to a prisoner and identified him as General . One of the letters written by Louvois made specific reference to de Bulonde's crime.\n\nAt the Siege of Cuneo in 1691, Bulonde was concerned about enemy troops arriving from Austria and ordered a hasty withdrawal, leaving behind his munitions and wounded men. Louis XIV was furious and in another of the letters specifically ordered him \"to be conducted to the fortress at Pignerol where he will be locked in a cell and under guard at night, and permitted to walk the battlements during the day with a 330 309.\" It has been suggested that the 330 stood for \"masque\" and the 309 for full stop. However, in 17th-century French \"avec un masque\" would mean \"in a mask\".\n\nSome believe that the evidence of the letters means that there is now little need of an alternative explanation for the man in the mask. Other sources, however, claim that Bulonde's arrest was no secret and was actually published in a newspaper at the time and that he was released after just a few months. His death is also recorded as happening in 1709, six years after that of the man in the mask.\n\nIn 1801, revolutionary legislator Pierre Roux-Fazillac stated that the tale of the masked prisoner was an amalgamation of the fates of two separate prisoners, Ercole Antonio Mattioli (see below) and an imprisoned valet named \"Eustache D'auger\".\n\nAndrew Lang, in his \"The Valet's Tragedy and Other Stories\" (1903), presented a theory that \"Eustache Dauger\" was a prison pseudonym of a man called \"Martin\", valet of the Huguenot Roux de Marcilly. After his master's execution in 1669 the valet was taken to France, possibly by capture or subterfuge, and imprisoned because he might have known too much about his master's affairs.\n\nIn \"The Man of the Mask\" (1908), Arthur Barnes presents James de la Cloche, the alleged illegitimate son of the reluctant Protestant Charles II of England, who would have been his father's secret intermediary with the Catholic court of France. Louis XIV could have imprisoned him because he knew too much about French affairs with England.\n\nOne of Charles's confirmed illegitimate sons, the Duke of Monmouth, has also been proposed as the man in the mask. A Protestant, he led a rebellion against his uncle, the Catholic King James II. The rebellion failed and Monmouth was executed in 1685. But in 1768, a writer named Saint-Foix claimed that another man was executed in his place and that Monmouth became the masked prisoner, it being in Louis XIV's interests to assist a fellow Catholic like James who would not necessarily want to kill his own nephew. Saint-Foix's case was based on unsubstantiated rumours and allegations that Monmouth's execution was faked.\n\nOther popular suspects have included men known to have been held at Pignerol at the same time as Dauger. Fouquet himself has been considered, but the fact that Dauger is known to have served as his valet makes this unlikely.\n\nAnother candidate, much favoured in the 1800s, was Fouquet's fellow prisoner Count Ercole Antonio Mattioli (or Matthioli). He was an Italian diplomat who acted on behalf of debt-ridden Charles IV, Duke of Mantua in 1678, in selling Casale, a strategic fortified town near the border with France. A French occupation would be unpopular, so discretion was essential, but Mattioli leaked the details to France's Spanish enemies, after pocketing his commission once the sale had been concluded, and they made a bid of their own before the French forces could occupy the town. Mattioli was kidnapped by the French and thrown into nearby Pignerol in April 1679. The French took possession of Casale two years later.\n\nThe prisoner is known to have been buried under the name \"Marchioly\", and many believe that this is proof enough that he was the man in the mask. The Hon. George Agar Ellis reached the conclusion that Mattioli was the state prisoner commonly called The Iron Mask when he reviewed documents extracted from French archives in the 1820s. His book, published in English in 1826, was also translated into French and published in 1830. German historian Wilhelm Broecking came to the same conclusion independently seventy years later. Robert Chambers' \"Book of Days\" supports the claim and places Matthioli in the Bastille for the last 13 years of his life. \n\nSince that time, letters sent by Saint-Mars, which earlier historians missed, indicate that Mattioli was only held at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite and was not at Exiles or the Bastille and, therefore, it is argued that he can be discounted.\n\nIn his letter to Saint-Mars announcing the imminent arrival of the prisoner who would become the \"man in the iron mask,\" Louvois gave his name as \"Eustache Dauger\" and historians have found evidence that an Eustache Dauger was living in France at the time and was involved in scandalous and embarrassing events involving people in high places known as l'Affaire des Poisons. His full name was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye.\n\nRecords indicate that he was born on 30 August 1637, the son of François Dauger, a captain in Cardinal Richelieu's guards. François was married to Marie de Sérignan and they had 11 children, nine of whom survived into adulthood. When François and his two eldest sons were killed in battle, Eustache became the nominal head of the family. Like them, he joined the army, where he came under the command of Armand de Gramont, Comte de Guiche, a brave soldier, notorious playboy and bisexual.\n\nIn April 1659, Eustache and Guiche were invited to an Easter weekend party at the castle of Roissy-en-Brie. By all accounts it was a debauched affair of merry-making, with the men involved in all sorts of sordid activities, including attacking a man who claimed to be Cardinal Mazarin's attorney. It was also claimed, among other things, that a black mass was enacted, and that a pig was baptized as carp in order to allow them to eat pork on Good Friday. Other activities, such as heterosexual and homosexual sex, may also have taken place.\n\nWhen news of these events became public, an enquiry was held and the various perpetrators jailed or exiled. There is no record as to what happened to Dauger, but in 1665, near the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, he allegedly killed a young page boy in a drunken brawl involving the Duc de Foix. The two men claimed that they had been provoked by the boy, who was drunk, but the fact that the killing took place near a castle where the king was staying meant that this was not a good enough explanation and, as a result, Dauger was forced to resign his commission.\n\nDauger's mother died shortly afterwards. In her will, written a year previously, she passed over her eldest surviving sons, Eustache and Armand, leaving the bulk of the estate to their younger brother Louis. Eustache was restricted in the amount of money to which he had access, having built up considerable debts, and left with barely enough for \"food and upkeep\". As titular head of the family, he had come into some small estates, but gave these up to Louis, who provided him with an additional annual payment.\n\nIn the 1930s, historian Maurice Duvivier linked Eustache Dauger de Cavoye to the Affair of the Poisons, a notorious scandal of 1677–1682 in which people in high places were accused of being involved in black mass and poisonings. An investigation had been launched, but Louis XIV had instigated a cover-up when it appeared that his mistress, Madame de Montespan was involved.\n\nThe records show that during the enquiry the investigators were told about a supplier of poisons, a surgeon named \"Auger\", and Duvivier became convinced that Dauger de Cavoye, disinherited and short of money, had become Auger, the supplier of poisons, and subsequently Dauger, the man in the mask.\n\nIn a letter sent by Louvois to Saint-Mars shortly after Fouquet's death while in prison (with Dauger acting as his valet), the minister adds a note in his own handwriting, asking how Dauger performed certain acts that Saint-Mars had mentioned in a previous correspondence (now lost) and \"how he got the drugs necessary to do so\". Duvivier suggested that Dauger may have poisoned Fouquet as part of a complex power struggle between Louvois and his rival Colbert.\n\nHowever, evidence has emerged that Dauger de Cavoye actually died in the Prison Saint-Lazare, an asylum run by monks which many families used in order to imprison their \"black sheep\". Documents have survived indicating that Dauger de Cavoye was held at Saint-Lazare in Paris at about the same time that Dauger, the man in the mask, was taken into custody in Pignerol, hundreds of miles away in the south.\n\nThese include a letter sent to Dauger de Cavoye's sister, the Marquise de Fabrègues, dated 20 June 1678, which is filled with self-pity as Eustache complains about his treatment in prison, where he has been held for 10 years, and how he was deceived by their brother Louis and Clérac, their brother-in-law and the manager of Louis' estate. A year later, he wrote a letter to the king, outlining the same complaints and making a similar request for freedom. The best the king would do, however, was to send a letter to the head of Saint-Lazare telling him that \"M. de Cavoye should have communication with no one at all, not even with his sister, unless in your presence or in the presence of one of the priests of the mission\". The letter was signed by the king and Colbert.\n\nA poem written by Louis-Henri de Loménie de Brienne, himself an inmate at the time, indicates that Eustache Dauger de Cavoye died as a result of heavy drinking in the late 1680s. Historians consider all this proof enough that he was not involved in any way with the man in the mask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She currently lives in Rogers, Arkansas.\n\nBorn as Frances Ruth Coker Burks after her grandmother, Burks was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and was friends with Bill Clinton growing up. During her childhood, her mother was hospitalized with tuberculosis for a prolonged period, during which Burks' father was her primary caretaker until his death when she was 5, after which her mother struggled with being Burks' parent. She cites these experiences as formative for her notable empathy.\n\nBurks’s family members have been buried in Files Cemetery since the late 19th century. When Burks was a young girl, her mother got into a row with Burks’s uncle. To ensure he and his branch of Burks would be never buried in the same place as the rest of the family, her mother bought every grave space in the cemetery. Those were 262 plots of land in Files Cemetery in Hot Springs. Later Burks' mother left that land to her.\n\nAs an adult, Burks worked as a real estate broker.\n\nBurks' first interaction with an AIDS patient occurred in 1984, when she was visiting a friend in the hospital. Burks' friend had cancer, so Burks spent a lot of time in the hospital. During one visit, she noticed that nurses were afraid to go into one room covered by a red bag and found out that the patient had what was then known as Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (GRID). Burks' cousin was gay, and she had an interest in learning about the disease and was curious about the patient behind the door. She met the patient, a young man who wanted to see his mother before he died. To force his mother to hear his wishes, Burke had to threaten the mother with the publication of the man's obituary in their hometown newspaper; even then, the mother called him a \"sinner\" and that she would not see him or claim the body when he died. Burks then took over his palliative care and comforted him until his death 13 hours later. After finding a funeral home that would take his body, she buried his ashes in her family cemetery.\n\nAfter that first encounter, Burks began to receive phone calls from others who needed her help, caring for over 1,000 people over the 30 or so years she worked with them. With assistance from her daughter, Burks has buried more than 40 people in her family cemetery in Hot Springs. While her charges were still alive, she helped take them to appointments, obtain medications, apply for assistance, and more. She also kept supplies of AIDS medications on hand, as some pharmacies would not carry these medications. Because of her work with people with AIDS, as she told KLRT-TV, she and her daughter were \"outcasts\" and crosses were burned in her yard twice. Burks received financial assistance from gay bars in Arkansas, including the Discovery Club in Little Rock: \"They would twirl up a drag show on Saturday night and here'd come the money. [...] That's how we'd buy medicine, that's how we'd pay rent. If it hadn't been for the drag queens, I don't know what we would have done.\" In 1988, Norman Jones, owner of the Discovery Club, created Helping People with AIDS, where Burks worked for several years. During Clinton's presidency, Burks was a White House consultant for AIDS education.\n\nBurks' patients lived longer past the national average life expectancy, catching the interest of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health which sent researchers to investigate.\n\nAfter medical care and social attitudes towards AIDS improved, she lived and worked in Florida as a fishing guide and funeral director. In 2012, Burks suffered a stroke and had to relearn many skills, including how to talk, read, feed herself and write; she attributes the stress of caring for victims of the AIDS crisis as a plausible influencing factor. The stroke also led to memory loss. That year, she moved back to Rogers, Arkansas, both in order to be closer to her family and because health insurance would no longer cover her after her stroke. In 2013, she advocated for three foster children who were removed from school due to rumors that one might be HIV-positive. After she appeared on TV as an HIV advocate for the children, the community blackballed her, the funeral home she had previously worked at rescinded her standing job offer, and other businesses refused to hire her, with the local Walmart allegedly removing a chair she sat in after finding out she did work with HIV advocacy.\n\nIn August 2016, she was honored at New York City's Pride Week by not-for-profit group Broadway Sings for Pride. Burks and others are working to create a memorial for victims of AIDS in Hot Springs, which would turn the Files Cemetery into a garden that fits its current status as a sort of pilgrimage site for those affected by the crisis. She has spoken at Washington State University and Gonzaga University on her experiences, and in 2017, Rose McGowan wrote and directed the short film \"Ruth\" to cover Burks' work.\n\n"}

He was the third son of Haj Hasan Bazzaz, from the Qaradagh. During his childhood, his eldest brother, who had become a highway robber, was executed by the authorities.\n\nThe family later moved to Tabriz where Sattar himself came into conflict with the law when he tried to find a hideout for two Caucasian fugitives to whom his father had given shelter. He was incarcerated for two years in Narin Qalʿa, a notorious local prison. Afterwards he too became a brigand and was subsequently imprisoned again. He also served in the gendarmerie controlling the main road between Khoy and Marand, and for a while found employment as part of the armed escort to the crown prince Mozaffar-al-Din Mirza and was given the title of \"khan\" (which means \"sir\" in the Persian language).\n\nLater, after a period in Tehran, he headed an auxiliary troop fighting Turkmen highway robbers near Mashhad.\n\nSattar Khan had close ties to the Social Democratic Party. He rose from obscurity to head Constitutionalist rebels from the Amirkhiz district of Tabriz. By 1907, he had become a favored leader of the rebels. After shelling the Majles (parliament) of Iran in the capital Tehran, 40 thousand of Mohammad Ali Shah's soldiers were ordered to attack Tabriz, where Constitutional rebels were holding out. In June 1908, under the leadership of Sattar Khan, a High Military Council was established. Sattar Khan was appointed the Commander in chief of High Council, Bagher Khan as his deputy, and Ali Musyo, Haji Ali and Seyed Hashem Khan as other notable members.\n\nBy April 1909, the Tabriz rebels had lost a large number of their fighters in driving out royalist forces from the city. Taking into account Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan's heroism during the battle, Sattar Khan was honored by the title of \"Sardar-e Melli\" (, \"National General\") and Bagir khan \"Salar-e Melli\" (, \"National Leader\") by the order of the Assembly.\n\nThe early victories of the rebels in Tabriz greatly influenced other Constitutionalists across Iran. Special committees with the name of \"Sattar Khan\" were established in Tehran, Rasht, Qazvin, Isfahan and other cities. Sattar Khan's reputation also led to the powerful Bakhtiyari tribal leaders to throw in their lot with the Tabriz rebels.\n\nMost of the cities of Azarbaijan province were cleared of royalist military forces by October 1908. Mohammad Ali Shah authorized the reopening of the Majles in Tehran in order to try and placate the opposition.\n\nThe Second Majles was held in December 1908. It ordered a plaque of honor with images of Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan carved on it in gold as a token of appreciation for their services.\n\nThe strengthening of revolutionary power in the wake of the Tabriz victory frightened not only the Qajar Shah but also his allies, Russia and Great Britain. In March 1910, Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan set out for the capital Tehran with 300 pro-Moderates soldiers, where they were greeted by large numbers of supporters April 3, 1910.\n\nSattar Khan and his warrior camped out in Atabek Park, where they refused to obey the Shah's order to disarm. The Shah's troops and police forces led by Yeprem Khan (Davidyans), head of Tehran police, launched a brief but violent confrontation on the night of August 7, 1910, and succeeded in surrounding and disarming Sattar Khan's forces. About 30 warriors were killed and Sattar Khan was wounded in his leg – remaining disabled until his death at the age 48, on November 9, 1914. He was buried in the famous Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine cemetery in Shahr-e Ray, just outside Tehran.\n\nSattar Khan is remembered in Iran as heroic leader of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution and is the subject of poems and songs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1117355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1117355", "title": "The Twits", "text": "The Twits\n\nThe Twits is a humorous children's book written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake. It was written in 1979, and first published in 1980. \"The Twits\" was adapted for the stage in November 2007.\n\nThe idea of \"The Twits\" was triggered by Dahl's desire to \"do something against beards\", because he had an acute hatred of them. The first sentence of the story is, \"What a lot of hairy-faced men there are around nowadays!\"\n\nA hideous, vindictive, spiteful couple known as the Twits live together in a brick house without windows (Mr. Twit reasons that this stops people looking in on them, not taking into account that windows are intended to be used for looking \"out\" rather than \"in\"). They continuously play nasty practical jokes on each other out of hatred for one another, ranging from Mr. Twit hiding a frog in his wife's bed that he claims is a monster to Mrs. Twit tricking her husband into eating worms in spaghetti. \n\nThey also keep a family of pet monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. The Twits, who are retired circus trainers, are trying to form the first upside down monkey circus, leaving the monkeys to stand on their heads for hours on end. If they fail to do what Mr. Twit says, Mrs. Twit beats them with her cane.\n\nMr. Twit also coats tree limbs with a strong sticky glue in hopes of catching birds for Mrs. Twit to make into a bird pie. The monkeys try to warn the birds, but since the monkeys speak in an African language, the English birds cannot understand them, so the poor birds wind up boiling in Mrs. Twit's pie. \n\nOne week, the Roly-Poly bird flies in from Africa to visit the monkeys, and acting as an interpreter of languages, keeps the birds from sitting anywhere Mr. Twit has spread glue. Mr. Twit tries several times to catch the birds, spreading the glue on an increasing number of perches, but the Roly-Poly bird changes his warning to reflect the new traps. Tired of chasing the birds, the Twits decide to buy guns to kill them.\n\nThe Muggle-Wumps, tired of being forced to stand on their heads, with the help of the birds use Mr. Twit's powerful glue to attach the couple's furniture to their ceiling while they are away to trick them into thinking that they are upside-down and that their ceiling is actually their floor. The birds also smear glue on the Twits' heads, which permanently fixes them to the ground when a panicked Mr. Twit suggests that they stand on their heads so that they are 'the right way up' after they first walk into the upside down living room. \n\nStuck on their heads with all their weight pressing down on them, they catch the \"Dreaded Shrinks\" (a disease that Mr. Twit had convinced Mrs. Twit that she had earlier in the book as one of the aforementioned pranks), their bodies compressing 'downwards' so that they eventually shrink away into nothing, leaving the Muggle-Wumps free to escape.\n\nMr. Twit is a wicked person, having hair that covers his entire face, with the exception of his forehead, eyes, and nose. His hair (which he falsely believes makes him appear \"wise and grand\" but is widely agreed by everyone else makes him look like a twit), is spiky and hard. Because he never washes it, his mustache holds scraps of food stuck there while he ate, including tinned sardines, Stilton cheese, and corn flakes. \n\nOccasionally, he licks these scraps out and eats them when he is hungry. Instead of wiping his mouth with a cloth, Mr. Twit simply wipes it on his sleeve. Mr. Twit is an alcohol drinker with a fondness for beer, he even drinks at breakfast. He is known to seem very quiet when he is plotting. He and his wife mistreat their monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. They have kept Muggle-Wump and his family locked up in a cage in the garden.\n\nMrs. Twit is the hideously ugly, menacing wife of Mr. Twit, whose former beauty was distorted as a result of constant horrible thoughts over time. She takes advantage of her glass eye to play practical jokes in revenge against her husband, and demonstrates multiple acts of cruelty and viciousness throughout the story; it has been mentioned that the main reason behind her use of a walking cane was as a weapon against innocent children and animals, she participates in the torment of the couple's pet monkeys the Muggle-Wumps, and serves Mr. Twit a lunch of worms disguised as spaghetti. \n\nAlbeit, while she frequently demonstrates acts of stupidity, she has also exhibited intelligence; she managed to maneuver her way out of a prank that ended with her being carried off into the sky by balloons by chewing through several of the strings and landing safely on the ground. However, aside from this, she is portrayed as being hideous, cruel, and unhygienic.\n\nA series of pranks advance the plot of the story. Brief descriptions appear below:\n\nMrs. Twit removes her glass eye and drops it in his beer mug while he isn't looking. It isn't until he empties said mug that he sees the eye sitting in there, startling him something awful. Mrs. Twit laughs, gloating that this proves she is always watching him.\n\nIn revenge for the glass eye trick, Mr. Twit places a frog in Mrs. Twit's bed, and frightens Mrs. Twit by claiming the item in her bed is a 'Giant Skillywiggler', with \"teeth like screwdrivers\" with which it would bite off her toes. Mrs. Twit then faints, at which point Mr. Twit splashes a jugful of cold water onto her face. She soon recovers, as the frog hops onto her face to get near the water. \n\nMr. Twit then claims the 'Giant Skillywiggler' will soon bite off her nose. Mrs. Twit then flees.\n\nSeeking revenge for the Frog Trick, Mrs. Twit places worms from the garden in cooked spaghetti, which Mr. Twit eats, being re-assured by Mrs. Twit that it is merely a new kind called \"Squiggly Spaghetti\" she has recently bought. When he has eaten it, Mrs. Twit joyfully reveals the truth, to Mr. Twit's horror and disgust.\n\nIn revenge for the Wormy Spaghetti, Mr. Twit glues pieces of wood no thicker than a penny onto Mrs. Twit's cane each night, as well as onto the legs of her chair, making Mrs. Twit believe that she is slowly shrinking. \n\nMr. Twit then frightens her by claiming that she has contracted an illness called the 'shrinks', by which she will be caused to disappear. Mr. Twit then claims that to cure the shrinks, Mrs. Twit will have to be \"stretched\". Mr. Twit then ties Mrs. Twit up in the garden to 60 gas balloons intending to leave her there for a while to teach her a lesson. \n\nHowever, once Mrs. Twit makes the mistake of saying that if the strings break, it's goodbye for her, Mr. Twit pretends to tie some more strings to her ankles, before cutting through the strings and sending her skywards. Mrs. Twit eventually returns by biting through several of the balloon strings so she sinks slowly down, eventually collapsing on Mr. Twit in the garden and beating him senseless with her long walking stick immediately afterwards.\n\nThere is a \"Big Dead Tree\" in the Twits' garden, which Mr. Twit uses to trap birds by spreading Hug-Tight Sticky Glue on the branches. Captive birds are then made into a pie by Mrs. Twit. During the story four schoolboys are caught instead of birds; but escape by unfastening their trousers and falling to the ground outside the Twits' garden after Mr. Twit said that he will make boy pie instead of bird pie. It is this use of glue that gives the captive monkey Muggle-Wump and his family the idea of using it against the Twits.\n\nUsing their friend the Roly-Poly Bird as an interpreter of languages, Muggle-Wump and his wife and children convey the warning that any bird landing on the Big Dead Tree will be cooked into Mrs. Twit's Bird Pie. When Mr. Twit, in retaliation, spreads glue on the monkeys' cage (which serves as a substitute perch), the monkeys alter the warning. The birds end up landing on the Twits' roof. \n\nThis enrages Mr. Twit, who doesn't want to keep waiting for his pie, so the Twits decide to go to the shop and buy a gun each. During their absence on this errand, Muggle-Wump plots a final trick: to turn the Twits' house upside down. With the help of the birds, Muggle-Wump removes the carpet from the floor, as well as all of the tables, chairs, and other objects in the house, and uses Mr. Twit's glue to stick the objects upside down to the ceiling, leaving the floor absolutely bare. \n\nBy doing this, the Twits will believe that they have been turned upside-down, as they will be standing on what looks like the ceiling of their house, and will stand on their heads to be the right way up. To keep their heads glued to the ground, two birds will put a small amount of glue on the Twits' heads right before they enter the house, so that when they stand on their heads, they will be stuck.\n\nJust as the preparations for this trick are finished, the twits return home. Everything goes as planned, the Twits believed they've been turned upside down and so stand on their heads to counter it, only to be stuck to the bare floor. However, heads are not made to be stood upon. With so much weight on it from above, the Twits literally get 'the shrinks', as was mentioned earlier in the book. However, this time it's not a trick, it's the real thing. After a week or so, the Twits disappear, and everyone who knew of them shouts \"hooray!\" \n\nMeanwhile, The Muggle-wumps and Roly-Poly bird escape to their native African land.\n\nSince February 2003, a feature film adaptation of the book has been in development by Vanguard Animation and its founder John H. Williams. As part of multi picture deal with Walt Disney Pictures, Vanguard was set to produce a CG animated/live action film, with John Cleese and Kirk DeMicco writing the screenplay. \n\nIn November 2004, it was reported that Mark Mylod signed up to direct the feature, and that Cleese may star in the film. In October 2006, after the executive/regime changes at Disney, the project moved to Working Title and Universal. By January 2012, the official site of Vanguard Animation stated that Conrad Vernon, the director of \"Shrek 2\" and \"Monsters vs. Aliens\", would direct the film.\n\n\n\n"}

The term applies whether the missing person is a child or an adult. \n\nOne reason unreported missing persons may not be formally listed as missing is that those over the age of majority can be \"voluntarily missing.\" Barring evidence of criminality or being a danger to oneself, privacy and confidentiality laws generally protect the rights of those who elect to remain out of contact with family or friends. If an adult unreported missing person is located in such an instance, the police are not obligated to inform the family of the missing person's whereabouts.\n\nAccording to Outpost For Hope, people can become unreported missing for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n\nAnother example is of children born to homeless or drug addicted mothers. These children are sometimes not registered anywhere and can become victims of crime without any of their other relatives or local agencies knowing. Other children who go missing but are unreported are often runaway foster children or children who are neglected or whose files are simply cases fumbled by police.\n\nSomeone can also become an Unreported Missing person through a victim of an exploitative crime, being involved in human trafficking or prostitution. A study by Professor Kenna Quinet states, \"The most successful serial killers know to select the unmissed as victims if they intend to kill for an extended period of time\". In her study she refers to serial killers targeting transient people because they are not easily missed, as well as people in institutionalized care.\n\nBeing unreported puts a person at a higher risk of exploitation than a person who is reported missing. There are many different outcomes or ways in which a person can be lost or \"off the grid\". These outcomes include situations like being mentally ill and lost among the homeless. When this happens, a person could very well be mentally ill or have a drug problem, go into the streets, cannot be reported missing by their family because they have a history of disappearing and then be the victim of murder or human trafficking. The family never sees them again and even if their body is found, the police have no way of tracking the person to their family as they are not listed in any formal missing database.\n\n"}

Historically women have played a major role on the home front. By the 18th century, some women accompanied armies assigned combat missions, usually handling roles such as cooking and laundry. Nursing became a major role starting in the middle 19th century. The main role in World War I (1914-1918) was employment in munitions factories, farming, and other roles to replace men drafted for the army. Women played an important role in making the system of food rationing work. World War II (1939-1945) marked a decisive turning point, With millions of women handling important homefront roles, such as working in munitions factories and otherwise replacing drafted men. Volunteer roles expanded. The most romantic new change was millions of women in regular military units. Typically they handled clerical roles so that men could be released for combat. Some women (especially in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Britain) were assigned limited combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units, where they shot down enemy bombers while at the same time being safe from capture. Underground and resistance movements made extensive use of women in support roles. Reaction set in after 1945, and the roles allowed to women was sharply reduced in all major armies. Restarting in the 1970s, women played an increasing role in the military of major nations, including by 2005 roles as combat pilots. The new combat roles were highly controversial for many reasons including differences in physical capabilities of the sexes and issues of gender identity for both women and men.\n\n"}
