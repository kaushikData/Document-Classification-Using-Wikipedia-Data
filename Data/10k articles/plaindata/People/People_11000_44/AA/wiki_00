He is a co-founder and former leader of the multi-organizational ultra-nationalist and neo-Nazi movement \"Social-National Assembly\" , that has transformed since 2015 into political youth organization \"Azov Civil Corps\" and later into National Corps political party, of which he is the leader. He was also the first commander of the volunteer-based Azov Regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine.\n\nBorn in 1979 in Kharkiv, Soviet Union, Biletsky's father Yevhen Mykhailovych Biletsky hailed from an old Cossack family that founded the village of Krasnopavlivka (Lozova Raion), while Biletsky's mother Olena Anatolivna Biletsky (\"née\" Lukashevych) descended from a noble family from Zhytomyr region, to which belong the Decembrist Vasiliy Lukashevich (Vasyl Lukashevych) who founded the \"Little-Russian Secret Society\".\n\nIn his youth, Biletsky practiced several types of martial arts and boxing. In 1990 he refused to be accepted into the Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization. Biletsky, along with senior schoolmates, raised the Ukrainian flag over his school. His major patriotic influence in his youth was his father's gift of a book prohibited in the Soviet Union, History of Ukraine for children by Anton Lototsky. In 2001, Biletsky graduated with honors from the History faculty of the University of Kharkiv. His thesis was about the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The same year Biletsky participated in the Ukraine without Kuchma (UBK) protests, for which he was placed under administrative arrest. The Security Service of Ukraine pressured university administration to expel Biletsky from the institution.\n\nIn 2002 Biletsky became a leader of the Kharkiv branch of the political organization Tryzub, and in 2003 cooperated with the Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU) opposing the idea of its transformation into Svoboda.\n\nAfter transformation of SNPU into Svoboda and liquidation of the original Patriot of Ukraine, in 2005 Biletsky initiated a revival of the Patriot of Ukraine, independent from any political factions. The new Patriot of Ukraine initially consisted of the Kharkiv branches of UNA-UNSO, Tryzub, and former SNPU. Since 2005, Biletsky also cooperated with the newly established Ukrainian Conservative Party.\n\nIn the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Biletsky unsuccessfully ran for Ukrainian parliament.\n\nOn 18 October 2008, Biletsky and other Patriot of Ukraine members were arrested during the Ukrainian Insurgent Army memorial march. In November 2008, Biletsky initiated the creation of the Social National Assembly (SNA) which included four other organizations: Spadshchyna (Heritage), Patriot of Ukraine (2005), Revolyutsiya i Derzhava (RiD, Revolution and State), and Slava i Chest (SiCh, Glory and Honor).\n\nIn August 2011, members of Patriot and SNA were arrested in connection with the Vasylkiv terrorists case. At the same time, there was an armed assault on the headquarters of Patriot of Ukraine in Kharkiv during which two members were wounded, while the assailant was injured. Patriot of Ukraine members were arrested and charged with an attempted murder on 11 September 2011. On 19 November 2011, there was an attempt on Biletsky's life when he was fired upon in Kharkiv receiving two bullet wounds. Biletsky managed to bring himself to the city hospital where he was operated upon. The local law enforcement classified the event as hooliganism. On 27 December 2011, Biletsky was also arrested on the same charges along with other Patriot of Ukraine members and was held in detention at the Kharkiv investigation jail (remand) for 28 months. The supporters of Social-National movements qualified the arrests as politically motivated repressions, and led to nationalist protests in several Ukrainian cities.\n\nDuring the Euromaidan events, members of the Biletsky's Patriot of Ukraine were among the founders of Right Sector on November 28, 2013. On 24 February 2014, the Ukrainian parliament adopted a decision on the freedom of political prisoners. The next day, Biletsky, along with other prisoners, were completely acquitted of all charges and freed from custody.\n\nOn 12 March 2014, Biletsky became a party leader in special operations for the \"Right Sector - East,\" which included such regions as Poltava, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts. On 5 May 2014 in Berdyansk Biletsky became a founder and commander of the Azov Battalion (as a territorial battalion of patrol service). Azov Battalion was transformed into a regiment on 20 November 2014. The battalion was initially composed of members of the Patriot of Ukraine, SNA, football fans (notably the Dynamo Kyiv supporters) and the AutoMaidan movement. The paramilitary formation became known as the \"Little black men\" as an opposition to the Russian special operations \"Little green men\".\n\nOn 13 June 2014, Biletsky led his detachment to the successful liberation of Mariupol (First Battle of Mariupol) from Russian separatists. According to British military reporter Askold Krushelnycky, \"Biletsky was cool in the evaluation of actions and giving orders calmly and, in my opinion, logically\". On 2 August 2014, Biletsky, holding a rank of Major of Militsiya, was awarded the Order For Courage(III degree) and promoted to lieutenant colonel of police on 15 August 2014.\n\nOn 10 September 2014, Biletsky was admitted to the military council of the People's Front, yet did not became a member of the party. On 27 September 2014, he ran as an independent candidate at the 217th electoral district (Kiev) for the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election and won by receiving 31,445 votes (33.75%). In parliament, he joined the inter-factional group Ukrop.\n\nIn an interview to LB.ua (Left Bank) given on 10 December 2014, Biletsky announced that the Patriot of Ukraine suspended its activities as political organization due to the war, and would be absorbed primarily into the Azov Battalion. In the same interview Biletsky said that logo of the battalion is different from the German Wolfsangel and symbolizes Ukrainian national idea.\n\nIn October 2016 Biletsky official left the Ukrainian military because (Ukrainian) elected officials are barred from serving the army. But he vowed to continue his military career \"without titles\".\n\nAndriy Biletsky during his first 3 years of work in Verkhovna Rada participated only in 2.09% of votings. He took part in only 229 votings, taking the fifth place in the rating of deputies with the least number of votings. Biletsky missed 328 sittings of the Ukrainian parliament. In addition, he missed all sittings of the Verkhovna Rada in 2016 and didn't appear in parliament as of March 2017. According to a research of the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, published in August 2017, Andriy Biletsky did not manage to write any laws that were adopted in the Verkhovna Rada. With 30 projects, he is in the first place among the deputies who submitted the largest number of unsuccessful draft laws.\n\nBiletsky belongs to a Ukrainian type of Rodnovery (Native Faith) which incorporates the beliefs of Mithraism.\n\n"}

{"id": "4237652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4237652", "title": "Athletic nickname", "text": "Athletic nickname\n\nThe athletic nickname, or equivalently athletic moniker, of a university or college within the United States is the name officially adopted by that institution for at least the members of its athletic teams. Typically as a matter of engendering school spirit, the institution either officially or unofficially uses this moniker of the institution's athletic teams also as a nickname to refer to people associated with the institution, especially its current students, but also often its alumni, its faculty, and its administration as well. This practice at the university and college tertiary higher-education level has proven so popular that it extended to the high school secondary-education level in the United States and in recent years even to the primary-education level as well.\n\nIn the United States, multiple recurring themes have appeared over time for choosing a school's athletic nickname. In almost all cases, the institution chooses an athletic nickname with an overtly positive goal in mind, where that goal reflects the character of the institution—either a previously established characteristic or a characteristic hoped for as a goal henceforth.\n\nOften by choosing an abstract concept as its athletic moniker, the institution wants to inspire its student-athletes on and off the field to achieve success that the abstract concept represents. Examples: Cornell Big Red, Stanford Cardinal, UIC Flames, Tulane Green Wave.\n\nOften by choosing an animal, the school wants to emphasize the instillation of fear of losing athletic competitions to the institution's teams, such as through an especially fierce or stealthy animal. When the school chooses an animal as its athletic nickname, usually in the plural or as a collective noun for a group of that animal, then typically, the school has that animal (in the singular) as its mascot, either specifically named with a proper noun or generically referred to without a proper noun. Examples: Michigan Wolverines, Oregon Ducks, Princeton Tigers, Iowa Hawkeyes, California Golden Bears.\n\nOften by choosing a collection that represents a summary of the institution's students or of its history. Such a collection may refer to an ethnicity; a profession; religious designation, such as saints; or other groupings of people. A portion of athletic monikers that fall into this collection category started originally as derogatory epithets from others, but as an act of defiance, the school embraced the term as a rallying cry to overcome the term's negative origin. Because a collection is hard to represent or iconify, when a school chooses a collection as its athletic nickname, the school typically chooses a related but different mascot that symbolizes that collection. Examples: Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Oklahoma Sooners, Purdue Boilermakers, Illinois Fighting Illini\n\nA small number of schools choose an archetypical heroic person as their official athletic nickname. This person may be a graduate of the school who is viewed as embodying the school's mission or an archetypal person who is symbolic of the school's area, such as the West Virginia University Mountaineer. In religiously affiliated schools, this person may be a historical person in the religion who has been bestowed an official designation in that religion, such as a saint in Roman Catholic or Orthodox Christianity.\n\nLikenesses to Native Americans were at one time widely popular athletic monikers, especially for schools that adopted them in the 19th or early 20th century. In recent years, some Native American organizations have protested the unlicensed use of likenesses of Native Americans related to team names, team logos, athletic monikers, cheerleaders, and cheering techniques. The granting of overtly expressed written licenses by Native American organizations to use likenesses of Native Americans in these ways is rare, although not unheard of. In one notable example, two major groups of the Seminole nation, the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, have expressly given Florida State University permission to use the nickname \"Seminoles\" and certain Seminole imagery. Central Michigan University has a similar arrangement with the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe to use the name \"Chippewas\".\n\nBecause of protests from some Native American organizations, some schools have changed their athletic moniker and mascot and cheering practices without significant objection once the issue was raised, especially if such offense toward a group of people was viewed as incompatible with that school's stated mission or if the threat of legal action was too burdensome. Other schools or their student bodies have defended their use of Native American likenesses, especially if the institution views the use of Native American likenesses as respectful or so intimately tied with history to be inseparable from the institution, such as if the name of institution derives from the name of a tribe. Still other schools have embarked on a series of failed attempts to find a replacement.\n\nOften, certain nicknames (animals and some abstract concepts, such as Giants, Broncos, or Wildcats) become very common. However, some nicknames are unique to that school/team such as Illini, Demon Deacons or Fords.\n\n"}

{"id": "1113360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113360", "title": "Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala", "text": "Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala\n\nBishweshwar Prasad Koirala (; 8 September 1914 – 21 July 1982), commonly known as B. P. Koirala, was a Nepali politician and a prolific writer. He was the Prime Minister of Nepal from 1959 to 1960. He led the Nepali Congress, a social democratic political party.\n\nKoirala was the first democratically \nelected and 22nd Prime Minister of Nepal. He held the office for 18 months before being deposed and imprisoned at the instruction of King Mahendra. The rest of his life was spent largely in prison or exile and in steadily deteriorating health.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest political personalities of Nepal, Koirala was a staunch supporter of democracy. He asserted that guarantees of individual liberty and civil and political rights alone were not sufficient in a poor country like Nepal; democratic socialism was the solution to Nepal’s underdevelopment.\n\nThe second son of Krishna Prasad Koirala, a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala was raised in Benares. Until the age of 14, he attended a school established by his father. Afterwards he joined the Harishchandra School in the city. He began writing when he was in the ninth grade.\n\nThe British Raj charged him and his brother, Matrika Prasad Koirala, with having contacts with terrorists in 1930. They were arrested and set free after three months. Because of this, Bishweshwar began to study at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta as per his father's wishes. Towards the end of 1930, he left college and returned to Benares. In 1932, he completed his intermediate level of studies. His father again insisted that his son join Scottish Church College in Calcutta. So for the second time, he joined the college, but left it soon afterwards. In 1934, he completed his bachelor's degree in Economics and Politics from Banaras Hindu University. He also earned a degree in Law from the University of Calcutta in 1937, and practised for several years in Darjeeling. \n\nWhile still a student, he became involved in the Indian nationalist movement. In 1934, he joined the Indian National Congress. During World War II, he was interned by the British in Dhanbad for two years (1942–1944).\n\nFollowing his release, with Indian independence imminent, he set about trying to bring change to Nepal. In 1947 he founded from India the socialist Nepali National Congress, which in 1950 became the Nepali Congress Party. On 9 March 1947, Koirala crossed over to Nepal for helping brother Girija Prasad Koirala instigate the Biratnagar jute mill strike. He was arrested along with Girija Prasad Koirala and four other National Congress leaders and taken with his fellow agitators to Kathmandu via a 21 days long, slow walk across the hills. The prisoners' march attracted much attention and helped to radicalise the peasants whose villages lay en route. The Koirala along with other detainees were kept in Kathmandu bungalow but were soon released after a 27-day hunger strike, popular protests, and at the request of Mahatma Gandhi in August 1947\n\nB.P. went back to India, and began looking for arms to storm Kathmandu. Finally Koirala led the Revolution of 1951 which overthrew Nepal's 104-year-old Rana regime. The last Rana prime minister was dismissed in October 1951 when the Rana-Congress coalition cabinet (in which Koirala served for nine months as the Home minister) broke apart. Koirala then concentrated on developing the Nepali political structure. King Mahendra responded with a new constitution enabling free parliamentary elections to take place in 1959. Only a fragmented parliament was expected, but Koirala's Nepali Congress scored a landslide, taking more than two-thirds of the seats in the lower house. After several weeks of significant hesitation, Mahendra asked Koirala to form a government, which took office in May 1959.\n\nKoirala led his country's delegation to the United Nations and made carefully poised visits to China and India, then increasingly at odds over territorial disputes. Yet, he was in trouble at home almost from the beginning. His land reform measures, especially the revision of the tenancy laws so easily passed by parliament, deeply offended the landed aristocracy which had long dominated the army. King Mahendra, on 15 December 1960, suspended the constitution, dissolved parliament, dismissed the cabinet, imposed direct rule, and for good measure imprisoned Koirala and his closest government colleagues. Many of them were released after few months, but Koirala, though he was suffering from throat cancer, was kept imprisoned without trial until 1968. \n\nIn 1968 the then Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, who led the liberal group in the Rastriya Panchayat, played a significant role in releasing B. P. Koirala from prison. Later in June, Mr. Thapa had to resign because of pressure from hardliners for releasing Mr. Koirala from prison. Then he finally left on a self-exile to live in Banaras.\n\nKing Birendra, educated in England and the United States, succeeded his father in 1972 when the political climate was believed to be gradually improving. Koirala, however, was arrested immediately upon his return from exile in 1976 and charged with the capital offense of attempting armed revolution. Finally, in March 1978, he was cleared of all treason and sedition charges. Then, in 1981, he was cleared to travel to the United States for medical treatment. The Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa convinced the king to allow Mr. B. P. Koirala to proceed to the U.S. for treatment as per recommendation from the royal physician Dr. M. R. Pandey. The government of Nepal bore a portion of the cost of his medical treatment in the U.S., while the rest was arranged by his nephew Shail Updhaya, Dr. Shukdev Shah, family and friends.\n\nAfter returning from a further medical visit to the United States, he had a series of audiences with King Birendra, as he tried for a \"national reconciliation\". During the student demonstrations in 1979, he was under house arrest. However, he welcomed King Birendra's call for a national referendum on the question of the political system for Nepal. The referendum results were announced to be in favor of retaining the political system led by the B. P. Koirala was the first leader to welcome the result of the national referendum and accepted the people verdict and claimed that the referendum was fair and free. However, owing to differences in the electoral process to seek membership of class organization as mandatory, Koirala demanded a boycott of the 1981 elections. \n\nDespite obviously failing health and political strength, Koirala could still draw a great popular support. He addressed one of Nepal's largest public meetings in recent years in Kathmandu's Ratna Park in January 1982. He died on 21 July 1982, in Kathmandu. An estimated half a million people attended his funeral.\n\nWhile Koirala is considered one of the most charismatic political leader of Nepal, he was also one of the most well-read and thoughtful writers of Nepalese literature. He wrote short stories and novels, and some poems. BP Koirala began writing short stories in Hindi. \n\nHis first stories were published in Banaras in \"Hansa\", a Hindi literary magazine edited by Prem Chand (India's Tolstoy). His first Nepali short story \"Chandrabadan\" was published in \"Sharada\", a Nepali literary magazine in 1935. Koirala was very good at depicting the character and mind of women. Four other stories of Koirala were included in \"Katha Kusum\" (an anthology of Nepali stories), published in 1938 in Darjeeling. As a social realist, with good psychological insight as he was first writer to write stories and novels based on human psychology in history of Nepalese literature, Koirala had established himself as one of the most important Nepali short story writers by 1938. Doshi Chashma [Guilty Glasses], Koirala's anthology of sixteen short stories, was published in 1949. He was one of the greatest writer to contribute to the Nepali literature.\n\nKoirala was very busy in the 1950s as he was often found amidst the political situations of Nepal. He was, however, able to write an incomplete novel \"Hitlar ra Yahudi\" (\"Hitler and the Jews\") in the form of travelogue. The 1960s were very productive for Koirala in terms of his literary output. He wrote many novels and short stories in jail during 1960–68. They include: \"Tin Ghumti\" (\"Three Turns\"), 1968; \"Narendra Dai\" (\"Brother Narendra\"), 1969; \"Sumnima\" (\"A story of the first Kirata woman\"), 1969; \"Modiain\" (\"The Grocer's Wife\"), 1980; \"Shweta Bhairavi\" (\"The White Goddess of Terror\"), 1983; \"Babu Ama ra chora\" (\"Father, mother and sons\"), 1989; and an incomplete autobiography \"Mero Katha\" (\"My Story\"), 1983, and many more yet to be published.\n\nKoirala also has dozens of political essays including the following: \"Rajatantra ra Lokatantra\" (\"Monarchy and Democracy\"), 1960; \"Thichieka Janata Jagisake\" (\"The Oppressed People Rise\"), 1969; \"Rastriyata Nepalko Sandarbhama\" (\"Nationalism in the Context of Nepal\"), 1970; \"Kranti: Ek Anivaryata\" (\"Revolution: An Absolute Necessity\"), 1970; \"Panchayati Vyavastha Prajatantrik Chaina\" (\"The Panchayat System is not Democratic\"), 1978; \"Prajatantra ra Samajvad\" (\"Democracy and Socialism\"), 1979; and \"Rastriya Ekata ko Nimti Ahwan\" (\"A Call for National Reconciliation\"), 1980.\n\nKoirala's writings (both political and literary) were banned until recently. Nepalese youths spent several years of imprisonment just on the charges of possessing Koirala's writings. Another problem is that his rare and important writings have been scattered all over. Old newspapers and magazines (including the underground publications) have to be researched. Libraries, museums, and archives in Kathmandu, Banaras, Calcutta, New Delhi, London, Paris, Berkeley, Stanford, and many other places have to be visited to collect the materials on Koirala. As a result, one can hope to produce volumes of his political writings and literary works.\n\nKoirala was the focus of Nepalese politics during the 1950s, 1960s, and the 1970s. Even today, long after his death, people of Nepal feel that the restoration of multi-party democracy is a tribute to him. Koirala was also one of the most important literary figures of Nepal. In politics Koirala was a social democrat; in literature he was an existentialist especially in his novel \"Tin Ghumti\" (\"Three Turns\"). He said that he wrote his literary works to satisfy his anarchist impulses, impulses which revolted against the traditional order of things. But as a social democrat he was in search of a political order that was agreeable to every citizen of Nepal.\n\nAs a politician, Koirala struggled throughout his life for the establishment of a multi-party democracy in his country. Traditional forces, still strong to resist such effort, made it very hard for \"B. P.\" to accomplish his political mission. As a social democrat, Koirala differed with communists; as he often said man cannot live by bread alone. He also differed with the capitalists as he thought that unbridled consumerism was immoral, and that the appalling exploitation of the world's resources was short-sighted and unrealistic. He believed that only socialism could guarantee political freedom and equal economic opportunities to the people. He said, \"socialism is the wave of the future.\"\n\nKoirala had studied economics, logic, literature, and law. He was a voracious reader of English, German, French, Russian, Hindi, Bengali and Nepali literature. His educational background and artistic abilities were combined in his own works to present a view of life in an artistic, logical and compelling manner. He would thus shake the conscience of Nepali readers by questioning their unreflective acceptance of the traditional value systems.\n\nKoirala's short stories were first published in the 1930s in Hindi and Nepali literary magazines. Koirala first came to notice in Nepali literature because often his characters seemed to have been treated with an understanding of Freudian psychoanalysis. Even when a short story or novel of Koirala was not Freudian in its approach, it was still noteworthy to Nepali readers because he presented an unconventional approach to life.\n\n\"Modiain\" (\"The Grocer's wife\") is probably his shortest novel. In \"Modiain\" Koirala looks at the Mahabharata war from the point of view of a young woman who loses her husband to the war. This woman was not alone. There were hundreds of thousands of young women who were widowed by the war. Thus, Koirala presents a passionate plea against the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita, which assumes that the world is but an illusion and thus makes life and death a meaningless phenomena and that the observance of one's own duty is the ultimate priority. Koirala was against war, and by looking at the Vedanta philosophy and the issue of war from a war widow's point of view, he once again shakes the conscience of the Nepali readers who generally tend to accept the philosophy of Vedanta especially its idea of karma (fate). Characteristically, Koirala presents one more instance in which he analyzes the mind of a woman, as he did in most of his short stories and novels.\n\nThe following institutions have been set up in his memory:\n\n\nAlso, various programs are organized in Nepal as well as outside Nepal to remember his selfless contributions to Nepal.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13719954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13719954", "title": "Chrissie Wellington", "text": "Chrissie Wellington\n\nChristine Ann Wellington (born 18 February 1977) is an English former professional triathlete and four-time Ironman Triathlon World Champion. She holds, or held, all three world and championship records relating to ironman-distance triathlon races: firstly, the overall world record, secondly, the Ironman World Championship course record (from 2009 until Mirinda Carfrae lowered it in 2013), and thirdly, the official world record for all Ironman-branded triathlon races over the full Ironman distance.\n\nShe won the World Championship in three consecutive years (2007–2009), but could not start the 2010 World Championship race because of illness, then – while suffering from injuries so severe that her former coach Brett Sutton said she should \"not even be on the start line\" – regained the title in 2011. She is the first British athlete to hold the Ironman Triathlon World Championship, and was undefeated in all thirteen of her races over the ironman distance. She is the only triathlete, male or female, to have won the World Championship less than a year after turning professional, an achievement described by the British Triathlon Federation as \"a remarkable feat, deemed to be a near impossible task for any athlete racing as a rookie at their first Ironman World Championships.\"\n\nShe lowered the world record on all three occasions (2009–2011) she raced Challenge Roth (formerly Quelle Challenge Roth) at Roth in Bavaria, Germany. Her current record of 8 hours 18 minutes 13 seconds is more than 32 minutes faster than the record which stood from 1994 to 2008, when Yvonne van Vlerken broke it by just over 5 minutes. Following her 2010 world record, her former coach Brett Sutton described Wellington as \"a person of true international sporting excellence that is overshadowed by no one in any other sport.\"\n\nPaula Newby-Fraser's course record at the Ironman World Championships had stood for 17 years until Wellington broke it in 2009. At the time of her retirement, Wellington held the four fastest times ever recorded by a woman over the ironman distance, and had the greatest number of sub-9 hour times – nine, five more than Newby-Fraser's previous record. In addition to the Ironman titles, she was also the 2006 International Triathlon Union (ITU) Age Group World Champion and the 2008 ITU long-distance World Champion.\n\nBefore becoming a professional triathlete, Wellington worked for the British government as an adviser on international development and, for Rural Reconstruction Nepal, on development projects in Nepal. International development remains one of her passions. She is actively involved in supporting charities relating to international development and supporting and encouraging women and girls to take up sport.\n\nShe became, after meeting the parents of Jon Blais at her first world championship, an ambassador for the Blazeman Foundation, performing a \"Blazeman roll\" in his memory at the finish line of all her triathlon races since then. She campaigns for full equality of women in prize money, sponsorship, and media reporting of sport, and equal opportunities, notably in cycling, for women to be able to compete on the same terms, and over the same race distances, as men.\n\nChristine Wellington was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and grew up in Feltwell, a small village in Norfolk. She was a competitive swimmer as a teenager, when she swam for \"Thetford Dolphins\", and went on to swim for her university. She describes herself as a \"sporty kid, swimming, playing hockey, running, but never excelling and always more interested in the social side of the sports scene\". She was educated at her local comprehensive school, Downham Market High School and Sixth Form, where she was a member of most school sports teams, but \"focused more on my studies than I did on reaching my full potential on the pitch.\"\n\nAfter graduating with first-class honours in geography from Birmingham University in 1998, Wellington travelled the world for two years, which she described as opening her eyes to the \"many problems that exist in the world, but also to the opportunity for positive change.\" In 2000, supported by a £10,000 scholarship from the Economic and Social Research Council, she enrolled in an MA course in development studies at the University of Manchester. Graduating with a Distinction in October 2001, she joined the UK government agency DEFRA in London to work on international development policy. At DEFRA, she was part of the team that negotiated for the UK at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and became involved in following up the UK government's commitments on water and sanitation. She also worked on post-conflict environmental reconstruction policy.\n\nDisillusioned with \"bureaucracy and paper pushing\", in September 2004 Wellington took sabbatical leave from DEFRA to work in Nepal for Rural Reconstruction Nepal (RRN), a Nepalese development NGO. Based in the capital, Kathmandu, she managed a community-led total sanitation scheme in Salyan, a conflict-affected district in the west of the country. She also performed many other tasks for RRN, including preparing project proposals, editing books and writing papers.\n\nOn leaving Nepal at the end of 2005, she travelled to New Zealand, Tasmania and Argentina before returning to her old job at DEFRA in May 2006. She left this job in February 2007 in order to become a professional triathlete.\n\nWellington's first triathlon race was at the Eton Super Sprints on 16 May 2004, where she finished third. In the following two months, she won this race on both occasions. In July and August she sampled two longer (Olympic distance) triathlons: the Milton Keynes Triathlon and the Bedford Triathlon, finishing fourth and third respectively. She had to put her triathlon racing on hold for her sabbatical in Nepal, where she was based in Kathmandu, at an altitude of 1350 m (4430 ft). Every morning before work she would cycle around the neighbouring countryside on her mountain bike, with a group of foreign and Nepali cyclists known as the \"Mongolian Cycling Team\". She would also go running along the many hilly trails in the Kathmandu valley. When riding around the outlying villages on her mountain bike she would often have to wait for male co-workers to catch up with her. During a religious holiday, she spent two weeks cycling with friends some 1400 km from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet to Kathmandu, crossing mountain passes over 5000 m, enduring sandstorms and blizzards, and reaching Base Camp on the northern (Tibetan) side of Mount Everest at 5208 m (17090 ft). Her coach, Brett Sutton, believes this experience to have been very useful altitude training for her later professional career, while Wellington herself regards it as having given her lasting mental strength.\n\nHer friends in Nepal remarked on how she never missed a morning bike ride, whether or not she was sick: \"Chrissie saying, 'Oh, I have a stomach bug' was like saying hello every day, but no matter how many bugs were inside her tummy she would always train and push herself every second\", said one friend, adding, \"We all wondered how fast she would be if she had no bugs – and that thought was scary.\"\n\nIn February 2006 she entered the Coast to Coast, a 243 km, two-day endurance race across the Southern Alps of New Zealand involving running, cycling and kayaking. She finished 2nd in this race, despite having no previous kayaking experience, apart from some brief training before the race.\n\nShortly after her return to the UK she won the 2006 Shropshire Olympic Triathlon. This qualified her to enter the ITU World Age Group (Amateur) Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, a title which she won on 2 September 2006, beating her nearest rival by 4 minutes and 2 seconds. She later said she \"trained really hard for this race for 10 weeks, juggling 20 hours [a week] of training with my full-time job.\"\n\nDuring this period, like most amateur triathletes, she had also continued entering running races. She had previously run the London Marathon for charity in 2002, finishing in 3:08:17, making her the fastest woman from her running club in that race. That result prompted her to get a running coach, Frank Horwill – whom she regarded as \"legendary and ever inspiring\" – and to take her running training much more seriously. She had hoped to improve her marathon time in the April 2003 London Marathon, but in March she collided with a car while riding her commuter bike in Clapham. The accident resulted in a haematoma in her left thigh, causing – in an example of myositis ossificans – a 5 cm spur of bone to grow from her femur. Unable to run the marathon, she took up swimming again, leading her to try triathlon racing in 2004. After her ITU victory, she took up cross-country racing for the first time, as a means of building strength for her triathlon races. She enjoyed some success in B and C grade cross-country events around London, winning several races including the South of Thames Championship in December 2006.\n\nAfter winning the world amateur title, Wellington began to consider taking the risk of giving up her job in order to become a professional triathlete. In January 2007, on the recommendation of a friend, she travelled to Switzerland to ask the opinion of the Australian triathlon coach, Brett Sutton. Within 5 days she had handed in her notice at DEFRA, and in February flew out to Thailand to join Sutton's teamTBB at their base in Phuket.\n\nShe turned professional with the intention of racing standard-distance events, and enjoyed early success, winning Olympic-distance events in Bangkok and Subic Bay, then returned to the UK where she won the sprint-distance event at Bleinheim. Later the same month she entered her first longer-distance event, the UK half-Ironman race at Wimbleball, but suffered mechanical problems with her bicycle (forcing her to climb the steep Exmoor hills in too high a gear) and finished in 5th place. She returned to winning form only six days later, at the shorter Zürich triathlon.\n\nOn 1 August 2007, Wellington took on her toughest challenge to date, the long-distance Alpe d'Huez Triathlon, known for its difficult summer heat, its altitude, and its hard climbs on both the bike and running stages. Despite a puncture and being forced off the road by an oncoming vehicle during a fast descent, she finished the bike stage 19 mins 30 sec in front of her nearest rival, Sione Jongstra, and extended her lead on the running stage to win the race by over 29 minutes, in 9th place overall.\n\nTowards the end of July, her coach had suggested that she was ready for an Ironman, despite the relatively low volume of her training. She said of Sutton, \"my training was more geared to standard distance, with not much high volume. I don't seem to need high-volume work like three-hour runs. I've done none of these since I've been with Brett. Some of the other girls will. This is why he is so special: he has an ability to spot potential even if the athlete can't. He said I was ready even on the training I was doing.\"\n\nAfter 10 days of acclimatisation at her team's base in Thailand, Wellington won Ironman Korea, in very hot conditions, finishing over 50 minutes ahead of 2nd placed Yasuko Miyazaki, in 7th place overall. By winning this race, she earned a slot to race at the Ironman world championships in Hawaii.\n\nOn 13 October 2007 (14 October UTC), Wellington won the Ironman world championship title at Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, together with US$110,000 prize money. She finished in 9:08:45, five minutes ahead of Samantha McGlone, running the marathon leg in 2:59:58, the second-fastest time recorded to date by a woman on the Hawaii course. Her victory was described as the \"biggest upset in Ironman Hawaii history\", \"a remarkable feat, deemed to be a near impossible task for any athlete racing as a rookie at their first Ironman World Championships\" and \"one of the biggest shocks in the sport's history.\"\n\nAt the Ironman Australia Triathlon in April 2008, her first Ironman since Hawaii, Wellington again won by a margin of five minutes, finishing 9th overall. Her marathon time of 3:01:53 was beaten by only two men. Only twenty days later, she attempted her first World Cup race, the Tongyeong BG Triathlon in Korea, but could only finish in 22nd place. She wrote, \"If I judged every day by whether I win or lose, yesterday would be considered a 'bad day' [...] But I need to have these days - because the 'defeats' expose my weaknesses, and enable me to grow, learn and develop as an athlete.\"\n\nAt the Ironman European Championship race held in Frankfurt, Germany on 6 July 2008, in perfect weather conditions, Wellington recorded the second-fastest time to date by a woman over the Ironman distance, just 32 seconds outside Paula Newby-Fraser's world record of 8:50:53 set in the 1994 Ironman Europe race, which was then held in Roth. Spectators were aware throughout the race that Wellington was close to breaking the world record, but she did not know exactly what it was, and in any case preferred to slow down to celebrate her victory over the last few kilometres, exchanging greetings and hi-fives with the crowd. Her coach said that her plan was \"to do it as easy as possible\" once she had got to the front. Other factors affecting her time were that she lost some of her nutrition on the bike (having to rely on the aid stations instead) and that the bike course was 2 km too long.\n\nLater that month, she retained her title at the long-distance Alpe d'Huez Triathlon, finishing second overall, more than 25 minutes ahead of second-placed Aléxandra Louison and only 1 minute 23 seconds behind the winning man, Marcus Ornellas. She recorded the fastest overall time for the ascent of \"les 21 virages\" (pictured, right).\n\nAt her previous two attempts on the half-Ironman distance, Wellington had finished 5th (Wimbleball, mechanical difficulties) and 3rd (Singapore, less than three weeks after her first Ironman). On 17 August 2008 she achieved her first win at the half-Ironman distance at the Timberman 70.3 triathlon in Gilford, New Hampshire, placing sixth overall, 18 minutes ahead of runner-up Amanda Stevens.\n\nTwo weeks after her Timberman win, Wellington met the ironman-distance world record holder, Yvonne van Vlerken on the latter's home ground at Almere in an eagerly-awaited clash for the ITU long distance World Championship title. Wellington won with a \"dominating performance\", more than 17 minutes in front of Denmark's Charlotte Kolters. Van Vlerken finished in third place, 19 minutes behind Wellington.\n\nIn October Wellington returned to Kona as defending champion and retained her title, setting a new Hawaii marathon course record of 2:57:44. Despite losing around 10 minutes because of a flat tyre – a delay which would have been greater if fellow competitor Rebekah Keat had not given her a spare CO cartridge – she finished some 15 minutes ahead of second-placed Yvonne van Vlerken.\n\nOn 27 October, Wellington announced that, together with Hilary Biscay and Belinda Granger, she would be leaving teamTBB and their coach Brett Sutton to train under new coach Cliff English. She said: \nI owe so much to Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that advised me to turn pro, he told me to do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team framework enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping \"development athletes\" who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence the time has come for me to move on.\nTwo weeks later, Wellington announced that, instead of Cliff English (fiancé and coach of her rival Samantha McGlone) her new coach would be Simon Lessing.\n\nDespite suffering from shingles, Wellington set a new record for ironman-distance triathlon races of 8:31:59 on 12 July 2009 at the Quelle Challenge Roth, beating Yvonne van Vlerken's record set a year earlier over the same course by 13 minutes and 49 seconds. Rebekah Keat, who finished second, 7 minutes 25 seconds behind Wellington, also beat van Vlerken's time. Wellington's bike split (4:40:28) was also a new world record. Commentator Timothy Carlson wrote, \"Superwoman Chrissie Wellington didn't just break it, she obliterated the one-year-old women's Iron-distance world record today.\"\n\nIn August, Wellington dropped her coach Simon Lessing to become self-coached.\n\nIn October, Wellington won the world championship for the third time with a new course record of 8:54:02, beating Paula Newby-Fraser's record of 8:55:28 which had stood since 1992. She finished 19 mins 57 secs ahead of second-place Mirinda Carfrae, the 2007 Ironman 70.3 World Champion who, in her first Ironman race, ran a marathon time of 2:56:51, fifty-three seconds faster than Wellington's record of the previous year. Wellington's victory was described as \"stunning\" and \"even more dominant\" than usual. Only 22 men were faster than Wellington.\n\nCommenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, \"But the revelation I had was watching how hard she worked for it ... and it was clear she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there.\" A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, \"Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009.\" Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, \"But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day.\"\n\nOn Saturday 2 January, during an intended 5-hour training ride in the Surrey Hills with her boyfriend and two other friends, Wellington fell from her bicycle when it slipped on black ice. She fractured her radius, two metacarpals and two fingers in her right arm and hand. She required surgery under general anaesthetic to insert wires (later removed) into her arm and wrist and had to wear a cast on her arm for six weeks.\n\nThe injury severely limited her training, but once the cast was removed she was able to train intensively with her friend Catriona Morrison near Águilas in south-east Spain. She later acknowledged that the crash was a blessing in disguise, enforcing a mental and physical break and enabling her to focus on other areas of improvement such as her strength and to properly resolve her hamstring problems, which had been hampering her running.\n\nWellington returned to competition on 6 June, when she defended her title at Ironman 70.3 Kansas. She won in a time of 4:07:49, more than 16 minutes in front of Pip Taylor, placing 11th overall (10th among the pro men).\n\nOn 18 July 2010 Wellington defended her Challenge Roth title in Germany in a new ironman-distance world record time of 8:19:13, placing seventh overall and bettering her own record by more than 12 minutes. In so doing, she set a new women's record for the bike split of 4:36:33, and then finished the race with a \"stunning\" 2:48:54 for the marathon, beating Erin Baker's record of 2:49:53 which had stood since 1990. Only three men recorded a faster marathon run, two of whom were less than a minute faster. Her winning margin (32:57) over second-placed Rebekah Keat was greater than her time (26:37) behind the winning man.\n\nAfter this race, her former coach Brett Sutton wrote, \"The triathlon world should be rejoicing. For the first time in the women's sport and second time in this sport they have a true champion not just a champion of the sport like Erin Baker and Paula Newby Fraser, but also a champion on the level of a Kieren Perkins, a 'Thorpedo' or a Michael Phelps if we look at swimming. If we take a look at running, a Haile Gebrselassie, a Paula Radcliffe.\" He added, \"You have in Chrissie a person of true international sporting excellence that is overshadowed by no one in any other sport.\"\n\nIn August Wellington set a new course record in her third consecutive victory at Timberman 70.3, but at the last minute on the day of the Ironman World Championship, 9 October 2010 she decided not to start the race because of illness, describing it as \"the hardest decision of her life to date.\" Subsequent blood tests, which also included an anti-doping control, showed that she had, or had had, bacterial strep throat, bacterial pneumonia and West Nile virus.\n\nOn 21 November, having allowed herself six weeks to recover from her illness, Wellington set a new world record for an Ironman-branded race over the full Ironman distance in Tempe, Arizona of 8:36:13. Her time was the third-fastest female ironman-distance time to date, beaten only by her two records in Roth. Despite riding the last two miles of the bike course on a flat tyre, she beat the previous course record by 35 minutes, and runner-up Linsey Corbin's time by 29 minutes. Her marathon time was only 4:44 slower than the fastest men's run, and her swim time only 32 seconds slower than the men's winner, Timo Bracht. Commentator Timothy Carlson quoted Wellington's boyfriend as saying, \"It's a sign of a true champion that she can pick herself up after something as painful as her withdrawal at Hawaii. Six weeks later, all the issues from Hawaii were behind her, and today she was phenomenal\", to which Carlson added, \"Phenomenal might have been an understatement.\"\n\nHaving trained in Stellenbosch since mid-February, Wellington won Ironman South Africa on 10 April in a new \"M-dot\" world record time of 8:33:56, lowering her own record by a little over 2 minutes. She finished in 8th place overall, nearly 35 minutes ahead of runner-up Rachel Joyce, who in turn broke the previous course record by 8 minutes. Not only did Wellington set new female bike, run and course records, but her marathon time of 2:52:54 was also faster than all of the men.\n\nIn July, Wellington bettered her own ironman-distance world record at Challenge Roth by exactly one minute, to 8:18:13. Her marathon time of 2:44:35 was also a new world record. Only four men finished in front of her, and only one man, the winner Andreas Raelert, who also set a new world record, was able to beat her marathon time.\n\nOn a routine training ride near Boulder, Wellington suffered a serious bike crash on Saturday 24 September, exactly two weeks before the World Championships in Kona. She received severe road rash (equivalent to second- or third-degree burns) on her left leg and injuries to her left elbow and hip. Wellington described the pain as \"intense\", much worse than the fractures she had suffered earlier in the year, but X-rays showed no broken bones. Her first attempt at training after the accident was on the following Tuesday when, despite a swollen, infected leg, she tried swimming. She could manage no more than two lengths, in pain she later described as \"excruciating\". She had to be lifted out of the pool, and given crutches to enable her to walk; her boyfriend Tom Lowe and coach Dave Scott had to carry her back to her car. The next day, Wednesday, she was due to fly to Kona, but she preferred to remain in Boulder, close to the experts treating her. The infection was causing her fever and night sweats, and the hip pain had disturbed her running gait.\n\nBy Saturday, the infection had died down, and she flew to Kona. On Sunday Wellington published a blog post in which she referred to Sun Tzu's book \"The Art of War\" and elaborated on how war strategy could be applied to triathlon, saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that \"It's not a race, it's war.\" The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over subsequent training sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1 km she had to stop, and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe. She later wote, \"I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'\", adding, \"I was convinced I'd broken my rib. Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly.\" The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her to go to the hospital for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.\n\nWelliington's condition improved over the remaining three days before the race, thanks in part to a new course of antibiotics, and continued ART and acupuncture treatments. In public, consistent with her mantra of \"never give your opponents anything\", Wellington admitted to little more than road rash, but journalists at the pre-race press conference were, correctly, able to detect a different, less confident, attitude in Wellington before the race.\n\nHer coach had advised her to hold back on her swim speed, otherwise she might not be able to complete the race; together with the lack of power in her left arm, that meant her swim was much slower than usual at 61 minutes. In contrast with her previous races at Kona, where Wellington had dominated on the bike, she started the marathon stage with five women still in front of her. Wellington's main concern, though, was Mirinda Carfrae, the 2010 champion who was only a little over three minutes behind her, and the only woman who had run faster than her on this course – a serious worry, given Wellington's injuries.\n\nHer hip had been in constant pain during the bike stage, but once she started on the marathon, her hamstrings began seizing up as well. She wrote, \"I saw my family at mile three and gave them a smile, but inside the pain was unbearable.\" She described the pain on the marathon as \"the worst I'd ever known. 'You are going to hurt like hell', I said to myself, because this is just the start.\" She ran the first half of the marathon in 1 hour 22 minutes – her fastest ever at Kona – increasing her lead over Carfrae to five minutes. Her body slowed down in the intense heat approaching the Energy Lab, where she passed Caroline Steffen to gain the lead. She crossed the finish line with a marathon time of 2:52:41, winning in an overall time of 8:55:08. Her marathon time was a course record until Carfrae crossed the line in second place 2 minutes 49 seconds later, in turn setting a new marathon course record of 2:52:09. Her overall time was second only to the course record she had set in 2009.\n\nAfter the race, her coach Dave Scott told journalist T J Murphy that Wellington was \"traumatised\" by the effects of her injuries, and that despite her \"stoic\" attitude, her injuries were \"worse than any of us might have imagined\", adding, \"I don't think Chrissie will appreciate me telling you this, but it's important.\" Murphy described her performance as \"inspirational\", but added, \"it was more than that. It was chilling. [...] It was chilling to watch because you could see Wellington racing her way right to the hospital, paying literally no heed to her brain's internal governor – one that has been wired into the human body through millions of years of evolution.\"\n\nLeaving open the possibility that she might return to triathlon racing, Wellington formally announced on 16 January 2012 that she would be taking a one-year break from professional Ironman racing in 2012, in order to spend more time in the UK with her friends and family, and to \"explore new opportunities\" which she would otherwise be unable to undertake with the necessary focus and dedication. Two exceptional opportunities arising in 2012 were promoting her book \"A Life Without Limits\" (due to be published the following month) and the London Olympics. She would also be able to devote more time to her charity work, to raising the profile of triathlon in the UK, and to representing her sponsors. Among the charities she hoped to spend more time supporting were Jane's Appeal, the Blazeman Foundation for ALS, Girls Education Nepal and Challenged Athletes Foundation. Having missed the 2000 Olympics when she was in Australia, she was keen to experience the Olympics in her home country in any capacity, whether as a spectator, as a volunteer, or in the media. In August she joined the BBC's television commentary team for both the men's and women's Olympic triathlon events.\nOn 3 December Wellington announced that she had decided to make her retirement from professional triathlon racing permanent. She referred to the World Ironman Championships in 2011, with the enormous difficulties she overcame on that occasion, as her \"perfect race\", the race which \"completed\" her. She would continue to be associated with the sport, but not as a professional racer.\n\nChrissie Wellington first discovered Parkrun when she came across 300 people lining up in Richmond Park on a Saturday morning, and spontaneously decided to take part. In February 2013, Chrissie joined Parkrun's staff as Head of Participation. She later became its Head of Health and Wellbeing.\n\nOn 2 May 2015 Wellington married Tom Lowe.\n\nChrissie Wellington has said she has two passions in life: sport and development. In her victory speech at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman, she referred to her experience teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston, where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives. She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together. In an interview, her coach Brett Sutton said: She has kicked around for years through South East Asia, working for underprivileged people. That's why she was in Nepal. Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.\n\nTo give you an insight into Chrissie Wellington's mind, her first talk to me about the media and the frenzy around her, was \"Boss, I don't want us to lose sight of what we discussed about my goal. I want to be able to use my triathlon result to help develop social programs for underprivileged kids in South East Asia. Any sponsor who does not believe this is a priority, we can do without. If it costs me a little money, I am at ease with that.\" [...] This is the real Chrissie, the one people don't see behind the flashy smile.\n\nReflecting on her victory three weeks later, Wellington wrote:\n\nAnyone that knows me has probably been on the receiving end of one of my rants. Like a stuck record I ramble on about development to anyone that will (pretend to) listen. It is my passion, and has been for a long time. Poverty, conflict, violence, crime, exclusion and so forth are not givens. They happen for a reason. We have the power to change things. And sport is one vehicle for doing so. It has the power to build bridges, to empower, to teach, to heal – this is what triathlon and every other sport should be about. I hope that I [...] can, in a small way, help to inspire people to take up sport, realise their own dreams and their full potential.\nChrissie Wellington was named the 2009 \"Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year\" at an awards ceremony on 23 November 2009, ahead of Jessica Ennis and Victoria Pendleton in an online public vote. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours for services to ironman triathlons and promoted to Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to sport and charity.\nIn December 2010, having previously awarded her the University's \"Sporting Achievement Award\" in 2007, the University of Birmingham granted her an honorary doctorate \"as a tribute to her work in both her passions: sport and international development\".\n\n\"The following table includes a complete list of all Chrissie Wellington's races as a professional triathlete\".\n\n\"Note also that the table is sortable: click on any column heading to sort the whole table by that column; click again to toggle between ascending/descending order\".\nNote\n\nSources\n\n\n"}

His father, Abraham, studied at Leipzig, then established himself as wholesale merchant in Bucharest, and exercised considerable influence with the Boyars. When Davicion Bally was twelve years old his father died, and it seemed as if the son would have to terminate his studies at that age, for the father's partner defrauded the family out of almost all their possessions; but, thanks to an excellent library which the elder Bally left Davicion, he familiarized himself with the Romanian, Greek, French, Italian, and German languages, in addition to Spanish, which he had learned in his father's house. He also made considerable progress in the study of Hebrew.\n\nBally occupied himself at first in the law office of his uncle, who had studied law at Leipzig, but was soon appointed \"camarash\" (treasurer) of the salt magazines established in the Danube ports; in this capacity in 1829 he saved from destruction the large stores of provisions and ammunition which the Russians had gathered at Zimnicea during the war against Turkey. In recognition Tsar Nicholas I conferred upon him the Order of St. Anna, sending it personally by the hand of General Kisselef, and awarded him the privilege of trading unrestrictedly throughout the Russian empire. In 1836 Bally was appointed cashier of the \"agie\" (police department), an office which he occupied for ten years without any remuneration. An ardent patriot, he even frequently provided the necessary funds for his office, at the same time contributed to the establishment of the first fire-brigade in Bucharest, and maintained at his own expense a band of Italian artists who were invited to that city to foster a taste for the theater in Wallachia.\n\nIn 1848 Bally embraced the cause of the Revolution, and got to know its leaders. He proclaimed the Revolution before the time they had agreed, and it is said that he thereby saved the lives of some of the leaders, as he had learned that the government had become aware of their preparations, and was proceeding to crush the movement by the execution of its chief promoters. Bally rendered services to the revolutionary government, and at the risk of his life helped certain members of the fallen régime to places of safety. But the Revolution failed three months later, and Bally aided those banished, and only escaped exile himself through his close relations with certain influential Boyars. Nevertheless, he was the subject of sharp animosity, and lost the greater part of his fortune in the episode.\n\nWhen in 1858 there appeared in Bucharest an anti-Jewish pamphlet entitled \"Prashtia\" (The Sling) and issued from the printing-office of the archbishop, C. A. Rosetti, chief of the Liberal party, criticised the publication harshly in the \"Romanul\" at Bally's request; and at the same time the latter made representations to the prince-kaimacam, requesting the confiscation of the pamphlet.\n\nBally was repeatedly elected member of the administrative council of the Sephardic community, and there maintained himself as a champion of reform. He had the statutes amended so as to permit a fairer representation, introduced the distribution of clothing and shoes to poor children, projected a series of reforms for the Talmud-Torah (1863), which later became a modern school, established a free-loan institution (1860), and a society for free medical attendance (1872). He found time withal for literary pursuits, and left behind him many manuscripts in Judæo-Spanish.\n\nTroubled by what he saw as persecutions of Jews inaugurated in 1866 by his former friends and allies of the Revolution of 1848, he left Bucharest for Jerusalem in August, 1882, dying there two years later.\n\n"}

He was a serving Punjab Police officer when he joined the organization Babbar Khalsa International and became a human bomb to assassinate the Chief Minister of Punjab.\n\nHe assassinated Beant Singh by blowing up his bullet-proof car at 5 p.m. on 31 August 1995 in the Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat, Chandigarh.\n\nDilawar Singh's mother, Surjit Kaur, and father, Baba Harnek Singh, live in Guru Nanak Nagar, Patiala, Punjab, India. His father was a government employee. Dilawar Singh had two brothers. His elder brother Chamkaur Singh is a senior financial analyst and revenue officiL in the Department of Youth Service, Government of India.

It is alleged by some sympathizers and Khalistani activists that, during Beant Singh's tenure, many of radicalized Sikhs were neutralized unlawfully. As per Asian Human Rights Commission, \"Terror reign of Khalistani activists led to a situation where Government under Chief Minister Beant Singh had to permit a situation, however unfortunate, where even subordinate police officers became the judge, jury and executioner of radicalized Sikhs leading to many fake encounters. Misguided Sikhs were picked up from their houses or fields and taken blindfolded to isolated places and told to run.

{"id": "3366732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3366732", "title": "Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.", "text": "Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.\n\nFrederick Law Olmsted Jr. (July 24, 1870 – December 25, 1957) was an American landscape architect and city planner known for his wildlife conservation efforts. He had a lifetime commitment to national parks, and worked on projects in Acadia, the Everglades and Yosemite National Park. Olmsted Point in Yosemite and Olmsted Island at Great Falls of the Potomac River in Maryland are named after him. He was the son of Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr., and he and his brother John C. Olmsted created Olmsted Brothers as a successor firm to their father's. Very soon after his father's death, Olmsted stopped using the suffix \"Jr.,\" but anything attributed to Frederick Law Olmsted after about 1896 is necessarily the son's work.\n\nOlmsted was born on Staten Island, New York, the son of Frederick Law Olmsted and Mary Cleveland Perkins, and half brother of John Charles Olmsted.\n\nAfter graduating from the Roxbury Latin School in 1890, he began his career as his famous father's apprentice. He worked early on two significant projects: the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and the largest privately owned home in the United States—the George Vanderbilt estate in North Carolina, famously called the Biltmore Estate.\n\nHe entered Harvard College where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1894. He then became a partner in his father's Brookline, Massachusetts landscape architecture firm in 1895. Shortly thereafter, his father retired. Olmsted and his half brother quickly took over leadership of the firm. For the next half-century, the Olmsted brothers' firm completed thousands of landscape projects nationwide.\n\nIn 1900 Olmsted returned to Harvard to teach, and he also established the school's first formal training program in landscape architecture.\n\nIn 1901, he was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt as a member of the Senate Park Improvement Commission for the District of Columbia, commonly known as the McMillan Commission. He joined other notable personalities such as Daniel H. Burnham, Charles F. McKim and Augustus Saint-Gaudens, with a charge to \"restore and develop the century-old plans of Major L'Enfant for Washington and to fit them to the conditions of today.\"\n\nIn 1910, he was approached by the American Civic Association for advice on the creation of a new bureau of national parks. This initiated six years of correspondence, including this letter to the president of the Appalachian Mountain Club, January 19, 1912:\n\nThe present situation in regard to the national parks is very bad. They have been created one at a time by acts of Congress which have not defined at all clearly the purposes for which the lands were to be set apart, nor provided any orderly or efficient means of safeguarding the parks ... I have made at different times two suggestions, one of which was ... a definition of the purposes for which the national parks and monuments are to be administered by the Bureau.\n\nHis best contribution was of a few simple words that would guide conservation in America for generations to come and were preserved in the National Park Service Organic Act (1916):\n\nTo conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\n\nOlmsted and his wife, Sarah Hall Sharples, whom he married on March 30, 1911, had one child.\n\nBy 1920, his better-known projects included plans for metropolitan park systems and greenways across the country. In 1928, while working for the California State Park Commission (now part of the California Department of Parks and Recreation), Olmsted completed a statewide survey of potential park lands that defined basic long-range goals and provided guidance for the acquisition and development of state parks. and was a founding member and later president of the American Society of Landscape Architects.\nUnder the leadership of John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., the Olmsted Brothers firm employed nearly 60 staff at its peak in the early 1930s. As the last surviving family member in the firm, Olmsted retired in 1949.\n\nA partial listing of Olmsted design projects in the nation's capital reads like a guide to National Park Service-managed sites: the National Mall, Jefferson Memorial, White House grounds, and Rock Creek Park. Olmsted also prepared the plan for Boston's metropolitan park system and a master plan for Cornell University, and was involved in the planning of Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, and Roland Park, Baltimore.\nThe Caracas Country Club (mid 1920s) is a beautiful urban rarity and simultaneously is the most successful homage to the valley of Caracas' natural scenery, which thanks to this project survives there, practically intact. The Caracas Country Club is today the only place in the city were one can actually see how the valley's original natural landscape was before the city was built. The transformation in the 1920s of the old haciendas Blandín, Lecuna, El Samán and La Granja turned a simple residential golf club's commission into a sensitive urban design and landscaping project that undoubtedly can be counted among the most notable American urbanisms of the Twentieth-century.\n\nHe was a founding member of the American Society of Landscape Architects and actively involved in numerous planning and design organizations and commissions, including the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, the Baltimore Park Commission, the National Park Service Board of Advisers for Yosemite, the National Conference on City Planning, the American City Planning Institute, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the American Academy in Rome. Olmsted received many awards and honors during his long career, among them the American Academy Gold Medal (1949) and the U.S. Department of the Interior Conservation Award (1956).\n\nIn his later years, Olmsted worked for the protection of California's coastal redwoods. Redwood National Park's Olmsted Grove was dedicated to him in 1953, the same year in which he received the Pugsley Gold Medal.\n\nHe was responsible for the original terrace-style 'master plan' layout of Cornell University, that is responsible for the large Arts Quad and Libe Slope. He also worked on the Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, Florida and Forest Hills Gardens in New York.\n\nOlmsted died while visiting friends in Malibu, California and is buried at Old North Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\n\n\n\n Accessed: 2007-09-13\n\n"}
{"id": "1160467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1160467", "title": "Gale Sayers", "text": "Gale Sayers\n\nGale Eugene Sayers (born May 30, 1943) is a former professional American football player who earned acclaim both as a halfback and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL). In a brief but highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. He was known for his elusiveness and agility, and was regarded by his peers as one of the most difficult players to tackle.\n\nNicknamed the \"Kansas Comet\", Sayers played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks football team of the University of Kansas, where he compiled 4,020 all-purpose yards over three seasons and was twice recognized as a consensus All-American. In his rookie NFL season, he set a league record by scoring 22 touchdowns—including a record-tying six in one game—and gained 2,272 all-purpose yards en route to being named the NFL's Rookie of the Year. He continued this production through his first five seasons, earning four Pro Bowl appearances and five first-team All-Pro selections. A right knee injury forced Sayers to miss the final five games of the 1968 season, but he returned in 1969 to lead the NFL in rushing yards and be named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. An injury to his left knee in the 1970 preseason as well as subsequent injuries kept him sidelined for most of his final two seasons.\n\nHis friendship with Bears teammate Brian Piccolo, who died of cancer in 1970, inspired Sayers to write his autobiography, \"I Am Third\", which in turn was the basis for the 1971 made-for-TV movie \"Brian's Song\". Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977 at age 34, and remains the youngest person to receive the honor. He was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary Team as a halfback and kick returner, the only player to occupy two positions on the team. For his achievements in college, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame the same year. His jersey number is retired by both the Bears and the University of Kansas. Following his NFL career, Sayers began a career in sports administration and business, and served as the athletic director of Southern Illinois University from 1976 to 1981.\n\nBorn in Wichita, Kansas, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, Gale Eugene Sayers is the son of Roger Winfield Sayers and Bernice Ross. His father was a mechanic for Goodyear, farmed, and worked for auto dealerships. Sayers' younger brother, Ron, later played running back for the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League. Roger, his older brother, was a decorated college track and field athlete. Gale Sayers graduated from Omaha Central High School where he starred in football and track and field. A fine all-around track athlete, he set a state long jump record of 24 ft 10 (7.58m) in as a senior in 1961.\n\nSayers was recruited by several major Midwestern colleges before deciding to play college football at the University of Kansas. While being interviewed during a broadcast of a Chicago Cubs game on September 8, 2010, Sayers said he had originally intended to go to the University of Iowa. Sayers said that he decided against going to Iowa after the Iowa head coach, Jerry Burns, did not have time to meet Sayers during his one campus visit. During his Jayhawks career, he rushed for 2,675 yards and gained a Big Eight Conference-record 4,020 all-purpose yards. He was three times recognized as a first-team All–Big Eight selection and was a consensus pick for the College Football All-America Team in both 1963 and 1964.\n\nAs a sophomore in 1962, his first year on the varsity team, Sayers led the Big Eight Conference and was third in the nation with 1,125 rushing yards. His 7.1 yards-per-carry average was the highest of any player in the NCAA that season. Against Oklahoma State, he carried 21 times for a conference single-game-record 283 yards to lead Kansas to a 36–17 comeback victory. In 1963, Sayers set an NCAA Division I FBS record with a 99-yard run against Nebraska. He finished the year with 917 rushing yards, again leading all rushers in the Big Eight. He earned first-team All-America recognition from the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), \"The Sporting News\", and United Press International (UPI), among others. In 1964, his senior year, he led the Jayhawks to a 15–14 upset victory over Oklahoma with a 93-yard return of the game's opening kickoff for a touchdown. He finished the year with 633 rushing yards, third most among Big Eight rushers, and also caught 17 passes for 178 yards, returned 15 punts for 138 yards, and returned seven kickoffs for 193 yards. He earned first-team All-America honors from each of the same selectors as in the previous year, in addition to the Associated Press (AP), among others.\n\nSayers was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the first round, fourth overall, in the 1965 NFL Draft, and was also picked fifth overall by the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League in the AFL draft. He decided that all things being equal, he would rather play in Chicago, and so after consulting his wife he chose to sign with George Halas's Bears. In his rookie year, he scored an NFL-record 22 touchdowns: 14 rushing, six receiving, and one each on punt and kickoff returns. He gained 2,272 all-purpose yards, a record for an NFL rookie, with 1,371 of them coming from scrimmage. Sayers averaged 5.2 yards per rush and 17.5 yards per reception. His return averages were 14.9 yards per punt return and a league-high 31.4 yards per kickoff return.\n\nAgainst the Minnesota Vikings on October 17, Sayers carried 13 times for 64 yards and a touchdown; caught four passes for 63 yards and two touchdowns; and had a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the 45–37 Bears victory. He was the last NFL player to score a rushing, receiving, and kickoff return touchdown in the same game until Tyreek Hill accomplished the feat over fifty years later, in 2016. Bears coach Halas lauded Sayers after the game, saying, \"I don't ever remember seeing a rookie back who was as good,\" and deemed his talents equal to former Bears greats Red Grange and George McAfee. \"And remember,\" said Halas, \"we used to call George 'One-Play McAfee'.\" On December 12, Sayers tied Ernie Nevers' and Dub Jones' record for touchdowns in a single game, scoring six in a 61–20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers that was played in muddy conditions at the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field. He accounted for 326 yards in the game: 113 rushing, 89 receiving, and 134 on punt returns. Sayers was the consensus choice for NFL Rookie of the Year honors from the AP, UPI, and NEA.\n\nIn his second season, Sayers led the league in rushing with 1,231 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry with eight touchdowns and becoming the first halfback to win the rushing title since 1949. He also led the Bears in receiving with 34 catches, 447 yards, and two more touchdowns. He surpassed his rookie season's kick return numbers, averaging 31.2 yards per return with two touchdowns. He also supplanted his all-purpose yards total from the previous season, gaining 2,440 to set the NFL record. The first of his kickoff return touchdowns that season came against the Los Angeles Rams, as he followed a wedge of blockers en route to a 93-yard score. Against the Minnesota Vikings in the Bears' final game of the season, and the first of Sayers' pro career with his parents in attendance, he carried 17 times for a franchise-record 197 yards after returning the opening kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. Sayers was named to All-Pro first teams by the AP, UPI, the NEA, \"The Sporting News\", and the Pro Football Writers Association, among others. Starring in his second straight Pro Bowl, Sayers carried 11 times for 110 yards and was named the back of the game. The Bears finished the season with a 5–7–2 record, and the \"Chicago Tribune\" tabbed Sayers as \"the one bright spot in Chicago's pro football year.\"\nIn Halas's final season as an NFL coach, Sayers again starred. Sharing more of the rushing duties with other backs, such as Brian Piccolo, Sayers gained 880 yards with a 4.7-yard average per carry. His receptions were down as well. He had three kickoff returns for touchdowns on 16 returns, averaging 37.7 yards per return. Only rarely returning punts—he returned three all season—Sayers still managed to return one for a score against the San Francisco 49ers, a game in which he also returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown and scored a rushing touchdown on a rain-soaked field in San Francisco's Kezar Stadium. \"It was a bad field, but it didn't stop some people,\" said 49ers coach Jack Christiansen of Sayers' performance. Christiansen said that after Sayers' kickoff return, he ordered that all punts go out of bounds. But Sayers received the punt and ran 58 yards through the middle of the field for the score. In a November game against the Detroit Lions, a cutback by Sayers caused future hall of fame cornerback Lem Barney to fall over, after which Sayers sprinted for a 63-yard gain. Later in the game he returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. After the season, Sayers was invited to his third straight Pro Bowl, in which he returned a kickoff 75 yards and scored a three-yard rushing touchdown and again earned player of the game honors. Chicago finished in second place in the newly organized Central Division with a 7–6–1 record.\n\nSayers had the most productive rushing yardage game of his career on November 3, 1968, against the Green Bay Packers, during which he carried 24 times for 205 yards. His season ended prematurely the following week against the 49ers when he tore several ligaments in his right knee including his anterior cruciate ligament, his medial collateral ligament and his meniscus cartilage. Garry Lyle, the teammate nearest Sayers at the time, said, \"I saw his eyes sort of glass over. I heard him holler. I knew he was hurt.\" Sayers had again been leading the league in rushing yards through the first nine games, and finished the year with 856 yards. After surgery, Sayers went through a physical rehabilitation program with the help of Piccolo, who had replaced him in the starting lineup. Despite missing the Bears' final five games, he earned first-team All-Pro recognition from several media outlets, including the AP, and UPI, and NEA.\n\nIn the 1969 season, after a slow start and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers led the league in rushing once again with 1,032 yards. He averaged 4.4 yards per carry and was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears' all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West's leading rusher and its leading receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the back of the game.\n\nIn the 1970 preseason, Sayers suffered a second knee injury, this time bone bruises to his left knee. Attempting to play through the injury in the opening game against the Giants, his production was severely limited. He sat out the next two games and returned in Week 4 against the Vikings, but he was still visibly hampered, most evident when he was unable to chase down lumbering Vikings defensive lineman Alan Page during a 65-yard fumble return. Sayers carried only six times for nine yards before further injuring his knee. He underwent surgery the following week and was deemed out for the remainder of the season. He had carried 23 times for 52 yards to that point. During his off time, Sayers took classes to become a stockbroker and became the first black stockbroker in his company's history. He also entered a Paine Webber program for 45 nationwide stockbroker trainees and placed second highest in sales.\n\nAfter another knee operation and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was kept out of the first three games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work him back into the rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later.\n\nSayers' ability as a runner in the open field was considered unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. He possessed raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds— and was also highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film \"Brian's Song\", likened his running to \"ballet\" and \"poetry\". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him \"the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest.\" Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: \n\nHe had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, and you could never get a clean shot on Gale. Never.\n\nOn his tendency to escape from tight situations, Sayers once proclaimed, \"Just give me 18 inches of daylight. That's all I need.\" He felt if his blockers created 18 inches of space for him to run through, he could break a run into the open field. This quick acceleration became a hallmark of his running style, although some of it was lost following the injury to his right knee. After the injury, he relied more on tough running and engaging tacklers for extra yards.\n\nDespite the production from Sayers, the Bears as a whole struggled to find success; in games that Sayers played, the team compiled a record of 29 wins, 36 losses, and 3 ties, and failed to reach the postseason. Because of this, Sayers' main focus each postseason was on the Pro Bowl, where he excelled. Showcasing his breakaway talents, throughout his Pro Bowl career he achieved runs of 74, 52, 51, 48, and 42 yards. In the Pro Bowl following his rookie season, he had kickoff returns of 51 and 48 yards, despite limited opportunities due to the East's attempts to punt and kick away from him. In the next season's game, his 10 yards-per-carry average set a Pro Bowl record. He was named the \"back of the game\", an honor he received again in 1968 and 1969, joining Johnny Unitas as the only players to win three Pro Bowl MVP awards. \"The Pro Bowl is the time to prove how good you are, playing against the best of your peers,\" recalled Sayers. \"I took it as a challenge. I came into the game in shape, came to play.\"\n\nIn 1967, Sayers and Bears teammate Brian Piccolo became the first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), became the subject of the made-for-TV movie \"Brian's Song\". The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, \"I Am Third\". A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.\n\nSayers worked in the athletic department at his alma mater, the University of Kansas, for three and half years, before he was named the athletic director at Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1976. He resigned from his position at Southern Illinois in 1981.\n\nIn 1984, Sayers founded Crest Computer Supply Company in the Chicago area. Under Sayers' leadership, this company experienced consistent growth and was renamed Sayers 40, Inc. Currently, he is chairman of Sayers 40, Inc., a technology consulting and implementation firm serving Fortune 1000 companies nationally with offices in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Canton, Massachusetts, Clearwater, Florida, and Atlanta. Sayers and his wife Ardythe are also active philanthropists in Chicago. They support the Cradle Foundation—an adoption organization in Evanston, Illinois, and they founded the Gale Sayers Center in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. The Gale Sayers Center is an after-school program for children ages 8–12 from Chicago's west side and focuses on leadership development, tutoring, and mentoring. In 2009, Sayers joined the University of Kansas Athletic Department staff as Director of Fundraising for Special Projects.\n\nIn September 2013, Sayers reportedly sued the NFL, claiming the league negligently handled his repeated head injuries during his career. The lawsuit claimed Sayers suffered headaches and short-term memory loss since retirement. It stated he was sometimes sent back into games after suffering concussions, and that the league did not do enough to protect him. The case was withdrawn after Sayers claimed it was filed without his permission, but he filed a new lawsuit in January 2014 along with six other former players.\n\nIn March 2017, Sayers' wife, Ardythe, revealed that he had been diagnosed with dementia four years prior. She stated that a Mayo Clinic doctor confirmed it was likely caused by his football career. \"It wasn't so much getting hit in the head,\" she said.\" It's just the shaking of the brain when they took him down with the force they play the game in.\" While he remains physically healthy, the disease has had an adverse effect on his mental health and memory in particular, making simple tasks such as signing his own name difficult.\n\nSayers' record of 22 touchdowns in a season was broken by O. J. Simpson in 1975, who scored 23; his 22 touchdowns remains a rookie record as of 2017. Sayers remains the most recent player to score at least six touchdowns in a game. His career kickoff return average of 30.56 yards is an NFL record for players with at least 75 attempts, and he is one of several players to have scored two return touchdowns in a game. He is tied with four other players for the second most career kickoff return touchdowns, with six. Sayers' rookie record of 2,272 all-purpose yards was broken in 1988 by Tim Brown, who gained 2,317 yards through 16 games, which was two more games than Sayers set the record in. His single-season all-purpose yards record of 2,440 set in 1966 was broken in 1974 by Mack Herron, who surpassed it by four yards.\n\nSayers was elected to the \"Lincoln Journal\"'s Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame in 1973, the first black athlete to be so honored. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977. His number 48 jersey is one of three retired by the Kansas Jayhawks football team.\n\nLater in 1977, Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is still the youngest inductee in its history. On October 31, 1994, at halftime of a Monday night game, the Bears retired his number 40 at Soldier Field, along with number 51, which had been worn by teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee named Sayers to its NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, which comprised the best players of the 1960s at each position. In 1994, Sayers was selected for the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as both a halfback and a kickoff returner; he was the only player selected for multiple positions. In 1999, despite the brevity of his career, he was ranked 22nd on \"The Sporting News\"'s list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.\n\n\n"}

He had two sisters, both of whom developed at normal rates. According to his father, He Yun, at birth he was small enough to fit in the palm of his parents' hands. When it became apparent the child was growing very slowly, doctors diagnosed the cause as the bone deformity osteogenesis imperfecta, which hinders normal bone growth and body height. He was a chain smoker.\n\nIn January 2007, He was invited to take part on a television program in Tokyo, Japan. His home of Inner Mongolia is also home to Bao Xishun, who at 2.36 metres tall was recognized by Guinness as the world's tallest man until September 2009. Their televised meeting in July 2007 attracted global media attention. In May 2008 he appeared in the British Channel 4 documentary called \"The World's Smallest Man and Me\" hosted by Mark Dolan. In the episode He and his family spent time with Mark who stayed over to celebrate Chinese New Year. In September 2008 he appeared with the world's longest-legged woman, Svetlana Pankratova, in London's Trafalgar Square, to publicize the release of the 2009 edition of the \"Guinness Book of World Records\".\n\nIn 2006 \"Guinness World Records\" disallowed an application from a then fourteen-year-old Nepalese boy, Khagendra Thapa Magar, who measured 53 cm, but reviewed the case once he reached 18 years of age in October 2010, when he was measured at 67 cm.\n\nFollowing his January 2007 appearance on television, in 2008 his status as the world's shortest man was verified by \"Guinness World Records\". His height was measured three times over the course of 10 hours before he received a certificate officially naming him as the world’s shortest man.\n\nIn September 2008, he travelled to the U.S. to help launch the 2009 edition of the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" in New York City, which certified him as the world's smallest man.\n\nOn 25 April 2010, He was featured in the tenth episode of the 16th season of the American reality show \"The Amazing Race\", filmed earlier in Shanghai. The episode was dedicated in his memory.\n\nPingping was admitted to a hospital on 3 March 2010 in Rome, after complaining of chest pains. He had been filming \"Lo show dei record\". He died on 13 March 2010 of heart complications at the age of 21. The Guinness World Records editor-in-chief, Craig Glenday, said that he was \"an inspiration to anyone considered different or unusual.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "43492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43492", "title": "Ian Dury", "text": "Ian Dury\n\nIan Robins Dury (12 May 1942 – 27 March 2000) was an English singer-songwriter and actor who rose to fame during the late 1970s, during the punk and new wave era of rock music. He was the lead singer of Ian Dury and the Blockheads and before that of Kilburn and the High Roads.\n\nDury was born at his parents' home at 43 Weald Rise, Harrow Weald, Middlesex (though he often pretended that he had been born in Upminster, Essex, which all but one of his obituaries in the UK national press stated as fact). His father, William George Dury (born 23 September 1905, Southborough, Kent; died 25 February 1968), was a bus driver and former boxer, while his mother Margaret (known as \"Peggy\", born Margaret Cuthbertson Walker, 17 April 1910, Rochdale, Lancashire; d. January 1995) was a health visitor, the daughter of a Cornish doctor and the granddaughter of an Irish landowner.\n\nWilliam Dury trained with Rolls-Royce to be a chauffeur, and was then absent for long periods, so Peggy Dury took Ian to stay with her parents in Cornwall. After the Second World War, the family moved to Switzerland, where his father chauffeured for a millionaire and the Western European Union. In 1946 Peggy brought Ian back to England and they stayed with her sister, Mary, a doctor in Cranham, a small village in Essex. Although he saw his father on visits, they never lived together again.\n\nAt the age of seven, he contracted polio; most likely, he believed, from a swimming pool at Southend on Sea during the 1949 polio epidemic. After six weeks in a full plaster cast in the Royal Cornwall Infirmary, Truro, he was moved to Black Notley Hospital, Braintree, Essex, where he spent a year and a half before going to Chailey Heritage Craft School, East Sussex, in 1951.\n\nChailey was a school and hospital for disabled children, and believed in toughening them up, contributing to the observant and determined person Dury became. Chailey taught trades such as cobbling and printing, but Dury's mother wanted him to be more academic, so his aunt Moll arranged for him to enter the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, where he recounted being punished for misdemeanours by being made to learn long tracts of poetry until a housemaster found him sobbing and put a stop to it:\n\nFrom 1964 he studied art at the Royal College of Art under Peter Blake, and in 1967 took part in a group exhibition, \"Fantasy and Figuration\", alongside Pat Douthwaite, Herbert Kitchen and Stass Paraskos at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. From 1967 he taught art at various colleges in the south of England. He also painted commercial illustrations for \"The Sunday Times\" in the early 1970s.\n\nDury married Elizabeth \"Betty\" Rathmell (born 12 August 1942, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire), on 3 June 1967 and they had two children, Jemima (born 4 January 1969, Hounslow, Greater London) and Baxter Dury (born 18 December 1971, Wingrave, Buckinghamshire, England). Dury divorced Rathmell in 1985, but remained on good terms. He also cohabited with a teenage fan, Denise Roudette, for six years after he moved to London. Later, he squatted at Oval Mansions, Kennington Oval.\n\nDury formed Kilburn and the High Roads (a reference to the road in North West London) in 1971, and they played their first gig at Croydon School of Art on 5 December 1971. Dury was vocalist and lyricist, co-writing with pianist Russell Hardy and later enrolling into the group a number of the students he was teaching at Canterbury College of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts), including guitarist Keith Lucas (who later became the guitarist for 999 under the name Nick Cash) and bassist Humphrey Ocean.\n\nManaged first by Charlie Gillett and Gordon Nelki and latterly by fashion entrepreneur Tommy Roberts, the Kilburns found favour on London's pub rock circuit and signed to Dawn Records in 1974 but, despite favourable press coverage and a tour opening for English rock band The Who, the group failed to rise above cult status and disbanded in 1975.\n\nThe group produced two albums: \"Handsome\" and \"Wotabunch\" (plus a 5-track \"Best Of\" EP).\n\nUnder the management of Andrew King and Peter Jenner, the original managers of Pink Floyd, Ian Dury and the Blockheads quickly gained a reputation as one of the top live acts of new wave music.\n\nDury's lyrics are a combination of lyrical poetry, word play, observation of British everyday life, character sketches, and sexual humour: \"This is what we find ... Home improvement expert Harold Hill of Harold Hill, Of do-it-yourself dexterity and double-glazing skill, Came home to find another gentleman's kippers in the grill, So he sanded off his winkle with his Black & Decker drill.\" The song \"Billericay Dickie\" rhymes \"I had a love affair with Nina, In the back of my Cortina\" with \"A seasoned-up hyena Could not have been more obscener\".\n\nThe Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included jazz, rock and roll, funk, and reggae, and Dury's love of music hall. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist Chaz Jankel (the brother of noted music video, TV, commercial and film director Annabel Jankel). Jankel took Dury's lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of Radio Caroline's Loving Awareness Band—drummer Charley Charles (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, Guyana 1945), bassist Norman Watt-Roy, keyboard player Mick Gallagher, guitarist John Turnbull and former Kilburns saxophonist Davey Payne. An album was completed, but major record labels passed on the band. Next door to Dury's manager's office was the newly formed Stiff Records, a perfect home for Dury's maverick style.\n\nThe single \"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\", released 26 August 1977, marked Dury's Stiff debut. Although it was banned by the BBC it was named Single of the Week by \"NME\" on its release. The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album \"New Boots and Panties!!\" which, although it did not include the single, achieved platinum status.\nIn October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury & the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff \"Live Stiffs Tour\" alongside Elvis Costello & the Attractions, Nick Lowe, Wreckless Eric, and Larry Wallis. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit \"What a Waste\", and the hit single \"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\", which reached No. 1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, \"Hit Me\" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album \"Do It Yourself\". Both the single and its accompanying music video featured Davey Payne playing two saxophones simultaneously during his solo, in evident homage to jazz saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, whose 'trademark' technique this was. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single \"Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3\" made number three in the UK.\nThe band's second album \"Do It Yourself\" was released in June 1979 in a Barney Bubbles-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the Crown wallpaper catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo.\nJankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the US after the release of \"What a Waste\" (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of \"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\"; according to Mickey Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury, Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the \"Do It Yourself\" LP, and he returned to the USA to concentrate on his solo career.\nThe group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of \"Rhythm Stick\" and their next single, \"Reasons to Be Cheerful\", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, who also contributed to the next album \"Laughter\" (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the \"Laughter\" album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.\n\nIn 1980–81 Dury and Jankel teamed up again with Sly and Robbie and the Compass Point All Stars to record \"Lord Upminster\" (1981). The Blockheads toured the UK and Europe throughout 1981, sometimes augmented by jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, ending the year with their only tour of Australia.\nThe Blockheads disbanded in early 1982 after Dury secured a new recording deal with Polydor Records through A&R man Frank Neilson. Choosing to work with a group of young musicians which he named the Music Students, he recorded the album \"Four Thousand Weeks' Holiday\". This album marked a departure from his usual style and was not as well received by fans for its American jazz influence.\n\nThe Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles' family, held at The Forum, Camden Town, with Steven Monti on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album \"Warts & Audience\" at the Brixton Academy.\n\nThe Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1992 when, following Jankel's return to England, they were invited to reform for the Madstock! Festival in Finsbury Park; this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan through late 1994 and 1995. In the early 1990s, Dury appeared with English band Curve on the benefit compilation album \"Peace Together\". Dury and Curve singer Toni Halliday shared vocals on a cover of the Blockheads' track \"What a Waste\".\n\nIn March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In early 1998 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album \"Mr Love-Pants\". In May, Ian Dury & the Blockheads hit the road again, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by Gilad Atzmon; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Ian Dury on 6 February 2000 at the London Palladium. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000.\n\nThe Blockheads have continued after Dury's death, contributing to the tribute album \"Brand New Boots And Panties\", then \"Where's The Party\". The Blockheads still tour, and are currently recording a new album. They currently comprise Jankel, Watt-Roy, Gallagher, Turnbull, John Roberts on drums, Gilad Atzmon and Dave Lewis on saxes. Derek The Draw (who was Dury's friend and minder) is now writing songs with Jankel as well as singing. They are aided and abetted by Lee Harris, who is their 'aide de camp'.\n\nIn 1984, Dury was featured in the music video to the Who's Roger Daltrey's minor hit single \"Walking in My Sleep\".\n\nDury's 1981 song \"Spasticus Autisticus\"—written to show his disdain for that year's International Year of Disabled Persons, which he saw as patronising and counter-productive—was banned by the BBC. Dury was a disabled person himself, having been left crippled by childhood polio. The lyrics were uncompromising:\n\n<poem>\n\nThe song's refrain, \"I'm spasticus, autisticus\", was inspired by the response of the rebellious Roman gladiators in the film \"Spartacus\", who, when instructed to identify their leader, all answered, \"I am Spartacus\", to protect him. According to Professor George McKay, in a 2009 article in \"Popular Music\" called 'Crippled with nerves' (an early Dury song title):\n\nDury described the song as \"a war cry\" on \"Desert Island Discs\". Although the song was banned from being broadcast by the BBC before 6 p.m. when it first came out, it was used at the opening of the London 2012 Paralympics.\n\nDury's confident and unusual demeanour caught the eyes of producers and directors of drama. His first important and extensive role was in Farrukh Dhondy's mini-series for the BBC \"King of the Ghetto\" (1986), a drama set in London's multi-racial Brick Lane area with a cast led by a young Tim Roth.\n\nDury had small parts in several films, probably the best known of which was Peter Greenaway's\n\"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\" (1989), as well as a cameo appearance in Roman Polanski's \"Pirates\" (1986). He also appeared in the Eduardo Guedes film \" Rocinante\" (1986), Alejandro Jodorowsky's \"The Rainbow Thief\" (1990), and the Sylvester Stallone science fiction film \"Judge Dredd\" (1995). His other film appearances included roles in \"Number One\" (1985) starring Bob Geldof, the Bob Hoskins film \"The Raggedy Rawney\" (1988), and \"Split Second\" (1992) starring Rutger Hauer and Kim Cattrall. He also appeared alongside fellow lyricists Bob Dylan and Tom Waits, respectively, in the movies \"Hearts of Fire\" (1987) and \"Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale\" (1990), also by Eduardo Guedes. His later films included the comedy \"Different for Girls\" (1996), and \"\" (1996), directed by Tim Pope, who had directed a few of Dury's music videos.\n\nDury also wrote a musical, \"Apples\", staged in London's Royal Court Theatre. In 1987 he appeared as the narrator (Scullery) in \"Road\" at the Royal Court Theatre. Among the cast was actress and singer Jane Horrocks, who cohabited with Dury until late in 1988, although the relationship was kept discreet.\n\nDury wrote and performed the theme song \"Profoundly in Love with Pandora\" for the television series \"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾\" (1985), based on the book of the same name by Sue Townsend, as well as its follow-up, \"The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole\" (1987). Dury turned down an offer from Andrew Lloyd Webber to write the libretto for \"Cats\" (from which Richard Stilgoe reportedly earned millions). The reason, said Dury, \"I can't stand his music.\"\nWhen AIDS first came to prominence in the mid-1980s, Dury was among celebrities who appeared on UK television to promote safe sex, demonstrating how to put on a condom using a model of an erect penis. In the 1990s, he became an ambassador for UNICEF, recruiting stars such as Robbie Williams to publicise the cause. The two visited Sri Lanka in this capacity to promote polio vaccination. Dury appeared with Curve on the \"Peace Together\" concert and CD (1993), performing \"What a Waste\", with benefits to the Youth of Northern Ireland. He also supported the charity Cancer BACUP.\n\nDury appeared in the \"Classic Albums\" episode that focused on Steely Dan's album \"Aja\". Dury commented that the album was one of the most \"upful\" he'd ever heard, and that the album \"lifted [his] spirits up\" whenever he played it. He felt that it showed the band's love for jazz musicians and that it had \"California in its blood ... [even though it was recorded by] boys from New York.\"\n\nDury also appeared at the end of the Carter USM track \"Skywest & Crooked\" narrating from the book \"Don Quixote\". The track appeared on \"1992 – The Love Album\".\n\nIt was known for some time before his death that Dury had cancer. He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 1996 and underwent surgery, but tumours were later found in his liver, and he was told that his condition was terminal. Upon learning of his illness, Dury took the opportunity to marry his girlfriend, sculptor Sophy Tilson, with whom he had had two children, Bill and Albert.\n\nIn 1998, his death was incorrectly announced on XFM radio by Bob Geldof, possibly due to hoax information from a listener. In 1999, Dury collaborated with Madness on their first original album in fourteen years on the track \"Drip Fed Fred\". Suggs and the band cite him as a great influence. It was to be one of his last recordings. He also performed again with the Blockheads in mid-1999 at Ronnie Scott's in Soho. This was a special performance recorded for LWT's \"South Bank Show\" and the audience were invited fans and friends of the band and crew. His deteriorating condition was evident and he had to take rests between takes and be helped on and off stage.\n\nIan Dury & the Blockheads' last public performance was a charity concert in aid of Cancer BACUP on 6 February 2000 at the London Palladium, supported by Kirsty MacColl and Phill Jupitus. Dury was noticeably ill and again had to be helped on and off stage.\n\nDury died of metastatic colorectal cancer on 27 March 2000, aged 57. An obituary in \"The Guardian\" read: \"one of few true originals of the English music scene\". Meanwhile, he was described by Suggs, the singer of Madness, as \"possibly the finest lyricist we've seen.\" The Ian Dury website opened an online book of condolence shortly after his death, which was signed by hundreds of fans. He was cremated following a humanist funeral at Golders Green Crematorium with 250 mourners at the service, including fellow musicians Suggs and Jools Holland as well as other \"celebrity fans\" such as MP Mo Mowlam.\n\nDury's son, Baxter Dury, is also a singer. He sang a few of his father's songs at the wake after the funeral, and has released his own albums – \"Len Parrot's Memorial Lift\" (2002), \"Floor Show\" (2005), \"Happy Soup\" (2011), \"It's a Pleasure\" (2014) and \"Prince of Tears\" (2017).\n\nIn 2002 a \"musical bench\" designed by Mil Stricevic was placed in a favoured viewing spot of Dury's near Poets' Corner, in the gardens of Pembroke Lodge, in Richmond Park, south-west London. The back of the bench is inscribed with the words \"Reasons to be cheerful\", the title of one of Dury's songs. This solar powered seat was intended to allow visitors to plug in and listen to eight of his songs as well as an interview.\n\nIn 1999 the autobiographical documentary \"On My Life\", directed by Mike Connolly, was released. The film, in which Dury recalled his life and career, intercut with concert footage, included contributions from painter Peter Blake and members of the Blockheads. The programme was broadcast in August 2009 BBC Four.\n\nBetween 6 January and 14 February 2009 a musical about his life, entitled \"Hit Me! The Life & Rhymes of Ian Dury\", was premiered and ran at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.\n\nA biopic entitled \"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\" starring Andy Serkis as Dury was released on 8 January 2010, and was nominated for several awards. Ray Winstone and Naomie Harris also appeared. The title of the film is derived from Dury's 1977 7\" single \"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\".\n\nA musical, \"Reasons to be Cheerful\", was produced by the Graeae Theatre Company in association with Theatre Royal Stratford East and New Wolsey Theatre. Set in 1979 the musical featured Dury classics in a \"riotous coming-of-age tale\". The 2010 production was supported by the Blockheads, while Sir Peter Blake donated a limited edition print of the \"Reasons to be Cheerful\" artwork.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43533025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43533025", "title": "John Reid Wolfskill", "text": "John Reid Wolfskill\n\nJohn Reid Wolfskill (September 16, 1804 - May 27, 1897) was a California pioneer who helped establish development of California's agricultural industry in the Sacramento Valley in the 19th century. In 1842, Wolfskill was the first settler to plant vineyards and fruit trees there. Born in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky and a pioneer of Solano County, \"he was the first English speaking man to settle in the area around what is now Winters, California\".\n\nHis brother, William Wolfskill, had migrated earlier to California and also contributed to its agricultural development. After they were settled, their younger brothers Milton, Mathus, and Sarchal Wolfskill joined John on his land grant \"Rancho de los Putos\", later renamed as the Wolfskill Ranch. In 1935 Wolfskill's descendants donated 100 acres of the ranch to University of California, Davis for use as an experimental orchard.\n\nWolfskill was born near Richmond, Kentucky on September 16, 1804. He was the son of Joseph and Sarah Reid Wolfskill. His paternal grandfather, Joseph Wolfskill, was a native of Germany, who immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He lived in North Carolina a while, and then moved to central Kentucky. His maternal grandfather, John Reid, after whom Wolfskill was named, was a native of Ireland and immigrant to the British colonies. He was taken prisoner by the British at Charleston, South Carolina, in the American Revolutionary War. He later settled in Kentucky.\n\nThe Wolfskill family were among early migrants from Kentucky to Missouri in 1809, where they settled at Boone's Lick near the Missouri River west of St. Louis, which was developing rapidly based on the lucrative fur trade. John and his siblings grew up on the frontier.\n\nIn 1828, Wolfskill set out for Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was part of Mexico. His older brother William Wolfskill had gone there some time before and worked as a fur trapper in the area for ten years. From there John traveled to Paris, Durango, Colorado also part of Mexico, and to Chihuahua, Mexico. He worked as a guard in Mexico for the transport of silver treasure between Chihuahua and Matamoras, a total of eleven expeditions during the next four years.\n\nAfter some time, Wolfskill took passage from Matamoras by ship to New Orleans, and thence up the Mississippi River, returning to his former home in Missouri. He lived and worked there for two or three years. In 1836, he returned to New Mexico. Planning to buy mules to sell in Missouri, he went to Oposura, Sonora. Indians stole all his mules during his journey. He was trying to raise money to join his brother William in Los Angeles, California, from where John had last heard of him. Wolfskill determined to set out from Santa Fe for California.\n\nWolfskill's brother William, who had become a naturalized Mexican citizen, was able to own land under the Mexican government rules, and received a large land grant in May 1842 in that area that developed as Winters, California in what is now Yolo County. He and John named the property Rancho Rio de los Putos, after a nearby creek. The name was derived by Spanish colonists from Lake Miwok \"puṭa wuwwe\", meaning \"grassy creek.\" \n\nJohn was later joined here by three of his younger brothers; Milton, Mathus, and Sarchal. A 1987 history of Yolo County identifies Wolfskill as the first settler to plant fruit trees and vineyards in this area, in 1842.\n\nAccording to a biographical note by the University of California, Wolfskill began to cultivate a few crops in 1851 along Putah Creek (formerly called Rio de los Putos by Spanish colonists), along with an orchard and vineyard in the Sacramento Valley. He bought fig, pear and English walnut trees, and grape cuttings in Los Angeles.\n\nInitially he had devoted the rancho chiefly to stock-raising, selling meat supplies to the many mining camps which were booming in the late 1840s and early 1850s during the early mining period. In the 1860s, he and his brothers switched to wheat-growing, and enclosed their land with fences to keep animals out. Wolfskill and his brother, William, divided their interests in the rancho, each taking one-half. John devoted most of his rancho to fruit-culture. A branch railroad was built to cross the ranch not far from Wolfskill's old home, the nearest station being Winters.\n\nIn 1858 at the age of 54, Wolfskill married Susan Cooper, a daughter of Maj. Stephen Cooper. They had been with the Donner Party, but had pushed on before getting trapped in the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) by winter. They had four children together: a son Edward and three daughters, Melinda, Jennie, and Frances.\n\nWolfskill ultimately divided his ranch among his children. In his last years he lived with his married daughter Frances and her husband Samuel Taylor. Wolfskill died in 1897.\n\n-In 1935, Wolfskill's heirs deeded 100 acres of the Wolfskill Ranch in Winters to the University of California, Davis, which had been founded in 1908. The land was to be used for an experimental orchard.\n\n"}
{"id": "26033941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26033941", "title": "Julian Assange", "text": "Julian Assange\n\nJulian Paul Assange (; born Julian Paul Hawkins; 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer and the editor of WikiLeaks. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the \"Collateral Murder\" video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance.\n\nIn November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange. He had been questioned there months earlier over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Assange continued to deny the allegations, and expressed concern that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his perceived role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered himself to UK police on 7 December 2010, and was held for ten days before being released on bail. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his bail and absconded. He was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012 and has remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since then. Assange has held Ecuadorian citizenship since 12 December 2017.\n\nDuring the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State. After the Democratic Party, along with cybersecurity experts, claimed that Russian intelligence had hacked Clinton campaign-related e-mails and leaked them to WikiLeaks, Assange said Clinton was causing \"hysteria about Russia\". He consistently denied any connection to or cooperation with Russia in relation to the leaks.\n\nOn 19 May 2017, the Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation into the rape accusation against Assange and applied to revoke the European arrest warrant. Although he is free to leave the Embassy, it is likely that he would then be arrested for the criminal offence of breaching his bail conditions. The London Metropolitan Police have indicated that an arrest warrant is still in force for Assange's failure to surrender himself to his bail. On 27 July 2018, Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno revealed that he had begun talks with British authorities to withdraw the asylum for Assange.\n\nJulian Paul Hawkins was born on 3 July 1971 in Townsville, Queensland, to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951), a visual artist, and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder. The couple separated prior to his birth.\n\nWhen Julian Hawkins was a year old, his mother married Richard Brett Assange, an actor, with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Assange regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname). The surname Assange is an Anglicisation of the Chinese name Au Sang from a Taiwanese man who married a Torres Strait Islander woman on Thursday Island. His mother had a house in Nelly Bay on Magnetic Island where they lived from time to time until it was destroyed by fire.\n\nChristian and Brett Assange divorced about 1979. Christine Assange then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, with whom she had a son before the couple broke up in 1982. Assange had a nomadic childhood, and had lived in over thirty Australian towns by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne, Victoria.\n\nHe attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979–1983) and Townsville State High School, as well as being schooled at home. He studied programming, mathematics, and physics at Central Queensland University (1994) and the University of Melbourne (2003–2006), but did not complete a degree.\n\nWhile in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa, and in 1989 they had a son, Daniel Assange, now a software designer. The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child. Assange was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood. Assange has other children; in an open letter to French President François Hollande, he stated that his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said that his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.\n\nIn 1987, Assange began hacking under the name Mendax. He and two others—known as \"Trax\" and \"Prime Suspect\"—formed a hacking group they called the International Subversives. During this time, he hacked into the Pentagon and other US Department of Defense facilities, MILNET, the US Navy, NASA and Australia's Overseas Telecommunications Commission; Citibank, Lockheed Martin, Motorola, Panasonic, and Xerox; and the Australian National University, La Trobe University, and Stanford University's SRI International. He is thought to have been involved in the WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers) hack at NASA in 1989, but he does not acknowledge this.\n\nIn September 1991, Assange was discovered hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel, a Canadian multinational telecommunications corporation. The Australian Federal Police tapped Assange's phone line (he was using a modem), raided his home at the end of October, and eventually charged him in 1994 with thirty-one counts of hacking and related crimes. In December 1996, he pleaded guilty to twenty-five charges (the other six were dropped), and was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond. The perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent and his disrupted childhood were cited to justify his lenient penalty.\n\nIn 1993, Assange gave technical advice to the Victoria Police Child Exploitation Unit and assisted with prosecutions. In the same year, he was involved in starting one of the first public Internet service providers in Australia, Suburbia Public Access Network. He began programming in 1994, authoring or co-authoring the Transmission Control Protocol port scanner codice_1 (1995); patches to the open-source database PostgreSQL (1996); the Usenet caching software NNTPCache (1996); the Rubberhose deniable encryption system (1997), which reflected his growing interest in cryptography; and Surfraw, a command-line interface for web-based search engines (2000). During this period, he also moderated the AUCRYPTO forum; ran Best of Security, a website \"giving advice on computer security\" that had 5,000 subscribers in 1996; and contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's \"Underground\" (1997), a book about Australian hackers, including the International Subversives. In 1998, he co-founded the company Earthmen Technology.\n\nAssange stated that he registered the domain leaks.org in 1999, but \"didn't do anything with it.\" He did, however, publicise a patent granted to the National Security Agency in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology: \"This patent should worry people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived in the bowels of an unaccountable foreign spy agency.\" Systematic abuse of technology by governments against fundamental freedoms of world citizens remained an abiding concern—more than a decade later, in the introduction to \"Cypherpunks\" (2012), Assange summarised: \"the Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen\".\n\nAfter his period of study at the University of Melbourne, Assange and others established WikiLeaks in 2006. Assange is a member of the organisation's advisory board and describes himself as the editor-in-chief. From 2007 to 2010, Assange travelled continuously on WikiLeaks business, visiting Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.\n\nWikiLeaks published secret information, news leaks, and classified media from anonymous sources. By 2015, WikiLeaks had published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses, and was described by Assange as \"a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents\".\nThe published material between 2006 and 2009 attracted various degrees of publicity, but it was only after it began publishing documents supplied by Chelsea Manning, that WikiLeaks became a household name. The Manning material included the \"Collateral Murder\" video (April 2010) which showed United States soldiers fatally shooting 18 people from a helicopter in Iraq, the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), a quarter of a million diplomatic cables (November 2010), and the Guantánamo files (April 2011).\n\nOpinions of Assange at this time were divided. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard described his activities as \"illegal,\" but the police said that he had broken no Australian law. United States Vice President Joe Biden and others called him a \"terrorist\". Some called for his assassination or execution. Support came from people including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of Ecuador Rafael Correa, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Britain's Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (then a backbench MP), Spain's Podemos party leader Pablo Iglesias, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, Argentina's ambassador to the UK Alicia Castro, and activists and celebrities including Tariq Ali, John Perry Barlow, Daniel Ellsberg, Mary Kostakidis, John Pilger, Ai Weiwei, Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Vaughan Smith, and Oliver Stone.\n\nThe year 2010 culminated with the Sam Adams Award, which Assange accepted in October, and a string of distinctions in December—the \"Le Monde\" readers' choice award for person of the year, the \"Time\" readers' choice award for person of the year (he was also a runner-up in \"Time's\" overall person of the year award), a deal for his autobiography worth at least US$1.3 million, and selection by the Italian edition of \"Rolling Stone\" as \"rockstar of the year\".\n\nAssange announced that he would run for the Australian Senate in March 2012 under the new WikiLeaks Party, and \"Cypherpunks\" was published in November. In 2012, Assange hosted a television show on RT (formerly known as Russia Today), a network funded by the Russian government. In the same year, he analysed the Kissinger cables held at the US National Archives and released them in searchable form. On 15 September 2014, he appeared via remote video link on Kim Dotcom's \"Moment of Truth\" town hall meeting held in Auckland.\n\nThe following February, he won the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal for Peace with Justice, previously awarded to only three people—Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, and Buddhist spiritual leader Daisaku Ikeda. Two weeks later, he filed for the trademark \"Julian Assange\" in Europe, which was to be used for \"Public speaking services; news reporter services; journalism; publication of texts other than publicity texts; education services; entertainment services.\" For several years a member of the Australian journalists' union and still an honorary member, he was awarded the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in June, and the Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in November, having earlier won the Amnesty International UK Media Award (New Media) in 2009.\n\nAfter WikiLeaks released the Manning material, United States authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange personally with a view to prosecuting them under the Espionage Act of 1917. In November 2010 US Attorney-General Eric Holder said there was \"an active, ongoing criminal investigation\" into WikiLeaks. It emerged from legal documents leaked over the ensuing months that Assange and others were being investigated by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia. An email from an employee of intelligence consultancy Strategic Forecasting, Inc. (Stratfor) leaked in 2012 said, \"We have a sealed indictment on Assange.\" The US government denies the existence of such an indictment.\n\nIn December 2011 prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and an alleged WikiLeaks interlocutor they claimed to be Assange; he denied this, dismissing the alleged connection as \"absolute nonsense\". The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June–July 2013. The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer a password, but evidence that the interlocutor was Assange was circumstantial, and Manning insisted she acted alone.\n\nAssange was being examined separately by \"several government agencies\" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI. Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was still under \"active and ongoing\" investigation at that time.\n\nMoreover, some Snowden documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the \"2010 Manhunting Timeline\", and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks. In the same documents there was a proposal by the National Security Agency (NSA) to designate WikiLeaks as a \"malicious foreign actor\", thus increasing the surveillance against it.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, WikiLeaks reported that three members of the organisation had received notice from Google that Google had complied with a federal warrant by a US District Court to turn over their emails and metadata on 5 April 2012. At the time, Google had been prohibited by the court's order from disclosing the existence of the warrant, but a subsequent order by the court gave Google permission to notify WikiLeaks regarding the warrant's existence and that Google had complied with the order. The warrants cited 18 USC 371, 641, 793(d), 793(g), and 1030, which include espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, theft or conversion of property belonging to the United States government, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and general conspiracy. According to the statement by WikiLeaks, the alleged offenses could add up to a total of 45 years of imprisonment each for Assange and other WikiLeaks staff.\n\nIn a 15 December 2015 court submission, the United States confirmed its \"sensitive, ongoing law enforcement proceeding into the Wikileaks matter.\"\n\nOn 13 April 2017, CIA Director Mike Pompeo called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\"\n\nOn 20 April 2017, US officials told CNN that they were preparing to file formal charges against Assange.\n\nUnited States prosecutors accidentally revealed the existence of criminal charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in an unrelated ongoing sex crime case in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nAssange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women with whom he had sex. He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was re-opened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \"lesser-degree rape\" (\"mindre grov våldtäkt\"). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.\n\nIn 2010, the prosecutor said Swedish law prevented her from questioning anyone by video link or in the London embassy. In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, she changed her mind and agreed to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, with interviews finally beginning on 14 November 2016. These interviews involved police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials and were eventually published online. By this time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \"lesser degree rape\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.\n\nOn 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\", she said.\n\nOn 19 June 2012, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño announced that Assange had applied for political asylum, that his government was considering the request, and that Assange was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nWikileaks insiders stated that Assange made the decision to seek asylum because he felt abandoned by the Australian government. The Australian Attorney-General at the time Nicola Roxon had written a letter to Assange’s legal representative Jennifer Robinson in which she wrote that Australia would not seek to involve itself in any international exchanges about Assange’s future. She also wrote that \"should Mr Assange be convicted of any offence in the United States and a sentence of imprisonment imposed, he may apply for an international prisoner transfer to Australia\". Assange’s lawyers described the letter as a \"declaration of abandonment\".\n\nAssange and his supporters state he is concerned not about any proceedings in Sweden as such, but believe that his deportation to Sweden could lead to politically motivated deportation to the United States, where he could face severe penalties, up to the death sentence, for his activities related to WikiLeaks.\nOn 16 August 2012, Foreign Minister Patiño announced that Ecuador was granting Assange political asylum because of the threat represented by the United States secret investigation against him and several calls for assassination from many American politicians. In its formal statement, Ecuador reasoned that \"as a consequence of [Assange's] determined defense to freedom of expression and freedom of press… in any given moment, a situation may come where his life, safety or personal integrity will be in danger\". Latin American states expressed support for Ecuador. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa confirmed on 18 August that Assange could stay at the embassy indefinitely, and the following day Assange gave his first speech from the balcony. Assange's supporters forfeited £293,500 in bail and sureties.\nHis home since then has been an office converted into a studio apartment, equipped with a bed, telephone, sun lamp, computer, shower, treadmill, and kitchenette.\n\nJust before Assange was granted asylum, the UK Government wrote to Foreign Minister Patiño stating that the police were entitled to enter the embassy and arrest Assange under UK law. Patiño criticised what he said was an implied threat, stating that \"such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna Convention\". Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service were stationed outside the building from June 2012 to October 2015 in order to arrest Assange for extradition and for breach of bail, should he leave the embassy. The police guard was withdrawn on grounds of cost in October 2015, but the police said they would still deploy \"a number of overt and covert tactics to arrest him\". The cost of the policing for the period was reported to have been £12.6 million.\n\nIn April 2015, during a video conference to promote the documentary \"Terminal F\" about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, María Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013. \"It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences\", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan \"was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result was caused by the United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened.\" Later, in an interview with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, but Assange stated that \"our code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet [...] and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn't think much more of it. [...] We didn't think this was anything more than just distracting.\" Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.\nParis newspaper \"Le Monde\", in its edition of 3 July 2015, published an open letter from Assange to French President François Hollande in which Assange urged the French government to grant him refugee status. Assange wrote that \"only France now has the ability to offer me the necessary protection against, and exclusively against, the political persecution that I am currently the object of.\" In the letter Assange wrote, \"By welcoming me, France would fulfill a humanitarian but also probably symbolic gesture, sending an encouragement to all journalists and whistleblowers ... Only France is now able to offer me the necessary protection ... France can, if it wishes, act.\"\n\nIn a statement issued by the Élysée Palace on 3 July 2015 in response to this letter, the French President said: \"France cannot act on his request. The situation of Mr Assange does not present an immediate danger.\"\n\nOn 4 July 2015, in response to the denial of asylum by France, a spokesman for Assange denied that Assange had actually \"filed\" a request for asylum in France. Speaking on behalf of Assange, Baltasar Garzón, head of his legal team, said that Assange had sent the open letter to French president François Hollande; but Assange had only expressed his willingness \"to be hosted in France if and only if an initiative was taken by the competent authorities\".\n\nOn 16 August 2016, Assange's lawyer in the UK, John Jones, was found dead, according to the first reports after being hit by a train in an apparent suicide. An inquest into his death found that the lawyer was accepted since March to a private psychiatric hospital with several issues of mental health, including bipolar disorder, and closed-circuit television cameras showed no-one was near him when he jumped before the train. Coupled with the death of WikiLeaks lawyer Michael Ratner from cancer in May, the death of both lawyers in such a short time span sparked conspiracy theories, and a tweet by WikiLeaks on 21 August said that an inquest ruled it was not suicide. Some Twitter users took this to imply assassination, but the linked article explained that the inquest found culpability on the part of the hospital for letting Jones outside since suicide requires mental competence.\n\nThe next day, on 22 August, a man scaled the embassy's walls, but was caught by the embassy's security.\n\nIn September 2016, Assange said he would agree to US prison in exchange for President Obama granting Chelsea Manning clemency. Obama commuted Manning's sentence on 17 January 2017. The next day, at his final presidential news conference, Obama stated, \"I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance.\" The same day, Assange's US-based attorney Barry Pollack asserted (without saying when or where) that Assange \"had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately\". Accordingly, Pollack maintained, the commutation—which specified Manning would be freed four months thence—did not meet Assange's conditions. On 17 May 2017, Manning was released from prison. Two days later, Assange emerged on the embassy's balcony and told a crowd that, despite no longer facing a Swedish sex investigation, he would remain inside the embassy in order to avoid extradition to the United States.\n\nOn 17 October 2016, WikiLeaks announced that a \"state party\" had severed Assange's Internet connection at the Ecuadorian embassy. The Ecuadorian government stated that it had \"temporarily\" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \"impacting on the U.S. election campaign\". In an interview published on 29 December, Assange said, \"The Internet has been returned\".\n\nIn the run-up to 2017 Ecuador's general elections, conservative candidate Guillermo Lasso promised that he would \"cordially ask Señor Assange to leave\" within 30 days of assuming office, should he be elected. The pro-business candidate said the country's London embassy \"isn't a hotel\" and that Ecuador is in no position to finance the Australian's stay there. After preliminary results in the second round of Ecuador's presidential election showed that Lasso is poised to lose – the WikiLeaks founder responded using the same language. \"I cordially invite Lasso to leave Ecuador within 30 days (with or without his tax haven millions)\", Assange tweeted, referring to the revelations made shortly before the vote.\n\nOn 6 June 2017, Assange tweeted his support for NSA leaker Reality Winner, offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for \"The Intercept\" who had allegedly helped the US government to identify Winner as the leaker. Assange posted on Twitter: \"Reality Leight [sic] Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with 'elite immunity'. She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press.\"\n\nOn 28 March 2018, Ecuador cut Assange's Internet connection at its London embassy \"in order to prevent any potential harm\". Officials said that Assange's recent social media posts denouncing the arrest of a Catalonian separatist leader \"put at risk\" Ecuador's relations with European nations. Assange is now silent on social media.\n\nIn May 2018, a team of \"Guardian\" journalists, including Luke Harding, reported that over a five-year span, Ecuador spent at least $5 million (£3.7m) through a secret intelligence budget to protect Assange at its London embassy, \"employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police\". Visitors included \"individuals linked to the Kremlin\". Ecuadorian officials had reportedly also devised plans to help Assange escape should British authorities use force to enter the embassy and seize him. \"The Guardian\" also reported that documents and \"a source who wished to remain anonymous\" had indicated that by 2014, Assange had \"compromised\" the embassy's communications system and arranged his own satellite Internet hookup. \"By penetrating the embassy's firewall\", Assange was allegedly able to \"access and intercept the official and personal communications of staff\". According to \"The Guardian\", this claim was denied by WikiLeaks as an \"anonymous libel aligned with the current UK–US government onslaught against Mr Assange\".\n\nOn 21 July 2018, Glenn Greenwald reported that the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry was finalising an agreement to release Assange into the custody of the British government. In a press conference the following week, President Lenín Moreno confirmed that he wanted Assange out of the embassy but also \"for his life not to be in danger\". This prompted wide speculation that Moreno aimed to strengthen Ecuador's relations with the United States and assist their extradition efforts.\n\nIn September 2018, Reuters reported that Ecuador had, in December 2017, granted Assange a \"special designation\" diplomatic post in Russia – and the cover to leave the embassy and England – but the British Foreign Office did not recognise diplomatic immunity for Assange, and the effort was dropped.\n\nOn 14 October 2018, ITV News reports that Assange's communications have been partially restored following a meeting between two senior UN officials and Ecuador’s President Lenin Moreno.\n\nOn 16 October 2018, congressmen from the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote an open letter to Lenin Moreno which described Assange as a dangerous criminal and stated that progress between the US and Ecuador in the areas of economic cooperation, counternarcotics assistance and the return of a USAID mission to Ecuador depended on Assange being “handed over to the proper authorities”.\n\nOn 19 October 2018, BBC News reported that Assange was starting legal action against the government of Ecuador, accusing it of violating his \"fundamental rights and freedoms\". Later that month, an Ecuadorian judge ruled against him, saying that a requirement for Assange to pay for his Internet use and clean up after his cat did not violate his right to asylum.\n\nPamela Anderson, a close friend and regular visitor of Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy, gave an interview with 60 Minutes Australia in November 2018 in which she asked the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to “defend your friend, and get Julian his passport back, and take him back to Australia and be proud of him”. Morrison rejected the request but his response was described as “smutty” and “lewd” by Anderson who wrote in an open letter to Morrison that “[y]ou trivialised and laughed about the suffering of an Australian and his family. You followed it with smutty, unnecessary comments about a woman voicing her political opinion”. She further advised Morrison that “[r]ather than making lewd suggestions about me, perhaps you should instead think about what you are going to say to millions of Australians when one of their own is marched in an orange jumpsuit to Guantanamo Bay – for publishing the truth. You can prevent this”.\n\nOn November 15, 2018, news broke that Assange has been charged in a sealed indictment, the secret accidentally revealed in a document unrelated to Assange. One former U.S. attorney speculated that the text from one case landed in another unrelated document due to a simple cut-and-paste mistake.\n\nOn 12 July 2018, The Inter-American Court of Human Rights published its opinion on Assange's asylum in a press statement that had been requested by Rafael Correa's government. According to Doughty Street, the ruling was made shortly after US Vice President Mike Pence raised the issue of Assange while on a visit to Ecuador. The ruling upheld the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits signatories of the American Convention on Human Rights from deporting foreign individuals when such a deportation would likely lead to their persecution \"on account of race, nationality, religion, social status or political opinions\". It concluded that the principle applies equally to diplomatic and territorial asylum.\n\nThe decision, according to multiple reporting outlets, in respect to Assange's status, outlines the necessity for \"third countries\" to allow for \"safe passage\" out of an embassy. Commentators have noted the near absence of this ruling from the American media. There have been inaccurate reports claiming the opinion does not mention Assange specifically, however there have also been accurate reports that recognise Assange's case is in fact mentioned by name. Among these is an article published by the VIPS Steering Group which concludes \"It is imperative[...] that Assange is allowed to make the safe passage to Ecuador demanded by the Court\". Jennifer Robinson, along with Spanish jurist Baltasar Garzon and other members of Assange’s defence team, had already submitted an amicus brief to ensure that \"the relevant principles would be considered by the Court.\"\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Assange had been subject to arbitrary detention by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison, on conditional bail and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the group, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.\n\nThe UK and Swedish governments rejected the claim. UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, said the claim was \"ridiculous\" and that the group was \"made up of lay people\", and called Assange a \"fugitive from justice\" who \"can come out any time he chooses\". UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant. The UK said it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy. Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, stated that the finding is \"not binding on British law\". Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has said that the finding is based on binding international law.\n\nAssange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: \"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgment and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ... she certainly should not become president of the United States.\" On 25 July, following the Republican National Convention (RNC), during an interview by Amy Goodman, Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. \"Personally, I would prefer neither.\" WikiLeaks editor, Sarah Harrison, has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.\n\nIt was revealed in October 2017 that during the United States presidential election, 2016, Cambridge Analytica funder and substantial GOP donor Rebekah Mercer had proposed creating a searchable database for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who personally emailed a request to Assange for Clinton's emails. Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request.\n\nOn 4 July 2016, during the Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted information and content of emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State, as originally released by the State Department in February 2016, based on a FOIA request.\nOn 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seemingly presenting ways to undercut Bernie Sanders and showing apparent favouritism towards Clinton, leading to the resignation of party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. \"The New York Times\" reported that \"Assange accused Mrs. Clinton of having been among those pushing to indict him...\" and that he had timed the release to coincide with the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In an interview with Robert Peston of \"ITV News\" Assange suggested that he saw Hillary Clinton as a personal foe.\n\nOn 26 August 2016, Assange spoke to Fox News and said that Clinton was causing \"hysteria about Russia\" after the Democratic Party, along with a number of cybersecurity experts and cybersecurity firms, claimed that Russian intelligence had hacked the e-mails and leaked them to WikiLeaks. This statement was repeated in the Russian media outlet RT.\n\nOn 4 October 2016, in a WikiLeaks anniversary meeting in Berlin with Assange teleconferencing from his refuge in the Ecuador embassy in London, reporters spoke of a supposed promise to reveal further information against Hillary Clinton which would bring her candidacy down, calling this information \"The October Surprise\". On 7 October, Assange posted a press release on WikiLeaks exposing over 2,000 emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The emails, ranging from 2007–2016, revealed excerpts of Clinton's paid Goldman Sachs speech in 2013. In the emails, she explained her relationship to Wall Street and how she had previously represented the community: \"even though I represented [people in finance] and did all I could to make sure they continued to prosper, I called for closing the carried interest loophole and addressing skyrocketing CEO pay. So when I raised early warnings about subprime mortgages and called for regulating derivatives and over complex financial products, I didn't get some big arguments, because people sort of said, no, that makes sense.\"\n\nAccording to Harvard political scientist Matthew Baum and College of the Canyons political scientist Phil Gussin, WikiLeaks strategically released e-mails related to the Clinton campaign whenever Clinton's lead expanded in the polls. On the eve of the general presidential election, Assange wrote a press release addressing the criticism around publishing Clinton material on WikiLeaks.\"We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish.\" He explains that the website received pertinent information related to the DNC leaks and Clinton political campaign, but never received any information on Trump, Jill Stein, or Gary Johnson's campaign, and therefore could not publish what they did not have. Assange has consistently denied any connection to or cooperation with Russia in relation to the leaks damaging to Clinton and the Democratic Party. \n\nSeveral parties have pointed out a strong pro-Russian bias in Assange's public comments and stated that the materials released by WikiLeaks \"never seem sable to leak anything damaging to the interests of the Russian\". Assange's claim that the Guccifer 2.0 emails were not provided to WikiLeaks by the GRU has led to further accusations that he is working in line with Russian propaganda.\n\nAssange is an advocate of information transparency and market libertarianism. He has written a few short pieces, including \"State and terrorist conspiracies\" (2006), \"Conspiracy as governance\" (2006), \"The hidden curse of Thomas Paine\" (2008), \"What's new about WikiLeaks?\" (2011), and the foreword to \"Cypherpunks\" (2012). He also contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's \"Underground\" (1997), and received a co-writer credit for the Calle 13 song \"Multi_Viral\" (2013).\n\n\"Cypherpunks\" is primarily a transcript of the \"World Tomorrow\" episode eight two-part interview between Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Andy Müller-Maguhn, and Jérémie Zimmermann.\n\nAssange's book, \"When Google Met WikiLeaks\", was published by OR Books on 18 September 2014. The book recounts when Google CEO Eric Schmidt requested a meeting with Assange, while he was on bail in rural Norfolk, UK. Schmidt was accompanied by Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas; Lisa Shields, vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Scott Malcomson, the communications director for the International Crisis Group. Excerpts were published on the \"Newsweek\" website, while Assange participated in a Q&A event that was facilitated by the Reddit website and agreed to an interview with \"Vogue\" magazine.\n\nSome of Assange's writings have been criticised for alleging conspiracies involving other journalists. In her 2017 documentary on Assange, Laura Poitras included a scene of him calling the Swedish sexual assault allegations a \"radical feminist conspiracy\", — a comment which she says led them to part ways. In 2011, Assange criticised a \"Private Eye\" article for portraying WikiLeaks contributor Israel Shamir as anti-Semitic. According to editor Ian Hislop, Assange called the article \"an obvious attempt to deprive [WikiLeaks] of Jewish support and donations\" and went on to point out that several journalists involved were Jewish. On 1 March 2011, Assange released a statement in which he said, \"Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, 'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and in word. It is serious and upsetting. We treasure our strong Jewish support and staff, just as we treasure the support from pan-Arab democracy activists and others who share our hope for a just world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28104012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28104012", "title": "Manuel de Brito Camacho", "text": "Manuel de Brito Camacho\n\nManuel de Brito Camacho (12 February 1862, Aljustrel — 19 September 1934, Lisbon) a Portuguese military officer, writer, publicist and politician, who among other positions, was Minister of Public Works, Commerce and Industry (1910–1911) and Republican High Commissioner to Portuguese Mozambique (1921 and 1923). He was the founder of the Partido Unionista (\"Union Party\"), and director of the newspaper A Luta (\"The Struggle\"), the mouthpiece of the same Party.\n\nManuel de Brito Camacho was born on Monte das Mesas, in the vicinity of Rio de Moinhos, a few kilometers from the village of Aljustrel, to a rural family of farmers. He was the half-brother of Inocêncio Camacho Rodrigues, the governor of the Bank of Portugal involved in the scandal caused by the thefts of Alves dos Reis.\n\nAfter primary studies in Aljustrel (1876–1880), he attended the Beja secondary school, afterward leaving for Lisbon where he attend preparatory studies at the Escola Politécnica, as a ward of uncle in Lisbon. Upon concluding his studies, he entered into the faculty of Medicine in the School of Medical-Surgery of Lisbon, completing his course in 1884, where he began his career in the parish of Torrão, Alcácer do Sal.\n\nIn 1891 he joined the Portuguese Army as surgeon-adjunct, and assigned to the military units in Tancos and later Torres Novas, a career that would ultimately make him a colonel.\n\nHis political career began in the 1893 General Elections, when he was a candidate for the district of Beja on the Republican electoral list. At that time he published Nove de Junho (\"Ninth of June\"), which questioned monarchist institutions. Following the election, he was disciplined, suspended for a year and transferred to the 2nd Division in Viseu. Shortly afterward he was reassigned to the Azores for his republican ideals, where he remained for a year. \n\nIn 1894, he returned to Viseu, and began regularly contributed as a correspondent, becoming one of the more notable figures in the Republican camp. By 1894 he had founded, with Ricardo Pais Gomes and Ribeiro de Sousa, the magazine O Intransigente (\"The Intransigent\"), a Republican publication that criticized the politics and propaganda of the time, which he maintained regularly until June 1895.\n\nFrom 1896 to 1897 he dedicated himself to publishing and collaboration with other Republican periodicals, and developed in Évora a political action committee, realizing several conferences and commissions.\n\nIn 1902 he presented a doctoral thesis in Medicine at the University of Paris, but abandoned his practice definitively as military medic, dedicated himself completely to journalism and politics. He promoted a conference titled A Coroa substituída pelo chapéu de côco (\"The Crown Substituted by the Hat\"), wherein he violently attacked institutional monarchism. Although disconnected with medical practice, he did run for a professorship at the \"Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de Lisboa\" (\"Medical-Surgery School of Lisbon\") in 1904.\n\nBrito Camacho founded, with other like-minded Republicans, the magazine A Lucta, which began printing on 11 January 1906. The publication quickly turned into an influential republican source, transforming itself into an official organ of the \"Partido Unionista\" (\"Unionist Party\").\n\nIn elections following the Lisbon Regicide he was elected as Republican deputy, transforming himself in the National Assembly and the press into the principal paladin for the removal of the monarchy (the throne then occupied by young King Manuel II). Camacho was one of the leaders of the movement that created the conditions for the implantation of the First Portuguese Republic on 5 October 1910. In preparation for these events, Brito Camacho was an important connection between the Republican movement and segments of the Army with republican ideals. His political actions and connection with the Republican movement allowed him to mediate during the process of forming the Provisional Government that followed.\n\nOn 23 November 1910 he was named the Ministério do Fomento (\"Minister of Public Works, Commerce and Industry\") in the Provisional Government of Teófilo Braga. In this function he was responsible for several reforms, including the division of the Instituto Industrial e Comercial de Lisboa (\"Lisbon Industrial and Commercial Institute\") a Portuguese school of vocational education founded in 1852, to form the engineering school Instituto Superior Técnico (at the University of Lisbon) and the economics/business management school Instituto Superior de Comércio (at the Technical University of Lisbon). On the creation of the \"Instituto Superior Técnico\" (IST) he invited Professor Alfredo Bensaúde, to teach the first Engineering classes, today still one of the first specialized engineering programs in the country (for mining, civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering). Courses in these fields were also standardized with a general period of study lasting two-years followed by a three-year period of specialized study. In December 1910 Camacho was responsible for the creation of the Associação de Classe Industrial de Veículos e Artes Correlativas (\"Association Industrial Vehicle Classes and Associated Arts\"), the precursor to the Associação Automóvel de Portugal (\"Automobile Association of Portugal\").\n\nBrito Camacho was one of the members of the government, along with Joaquim Teófilo Braga, António José de Almeida, Afonso Costa, José Relvas, António Xavier Correia Barreto, Amaro de Azevedo Gomes and Bernardino Machado, who signed the Law of Separation specifying the separation of Church and State (on 20 April 1911).\n\nIn September 1911, in the first post-Revolutionary elections, he was returned to the government benches.\n\nBut, as Brito Camacho resumed the directorship of A Lucta, his support for the Portuguese Republican Party had begun to dissolve. He eventually led a faction on the right of the political spectrum whom split from the Republican Party to form the Partido da União Republicana (\"Republican Union Party\"), later abbreviated to the Partido Unionista (\"Unionist Party\"). The newspaper, A Luta began to function as an organ of the Party. Manuel then began to develop an intense journalistic and political program to counter the hegemony of the Portuguese Republican Party, which was rechristened the Partido Democrático (\"Democratic Party\"); the Unionists would assume the role of opposition in successive governments.\n\nIn 1918, after the election of António José de Almeida as President, the Unionist and Evolutionist Parties decided to merge, creating the Partido Liberal Republicano (\"Liberal Republican Party\"). As a consequence, Brito Camacho slowly reduced his political activity and finally abandoned the leadership of the Party; in his reduced capacity, Brito Camacho even refused the invitation to form a government supported by the Liberal Republican Party. \n\nBetween March 1921 and September 1923 he exercised functions as the Republican High-Commissioner in Portuguese Mozambique, taking residence in Lourenço Marques until 1922.\n\nGenerally, he was a militant republican throughout his life, with an acidic tongue and who was not too popular or respected during his time. His acerbic humor was a reflection of his unhappy upbringing and life. Although he did marry, to an important property-owner's daughter in the region of Aljustrel, his wife died giving birth to their own child, a daughter. The child died shortly after her birth. He was not a humble man, but at the same time he lived a life of austerity and miserly reclusivity, in a home that could pass for an unsuccessful farmer.\n\nBecause of his militant atheism, he was commonly forgotten by the regime of the \"Estado Novo\". A close study of his writings makes it difficult to reconcile some of his libertarian ideas. Although Camacho, did promote the national Strike Law which created conflict between the working and bourgeois classes, he did not generally side with one group or the other; he was a defender of all his constituents in the Alentejo, and defended their interests against the central power. His actions in the development of the Crédito Agrícola were due to the development of a policy on cereals, then the Estado Novo concern for the economic development of small and medium-size farms.\n\nIn 1925, continuing his role as deputy, he made it clear his interest in abandoning active politics. He continued to promote the defense of the democratic ideals and political stability within the Republic. As a consequence of the 28 May 1926 Revolution, he was forced to abandon politics and retreated into private life.\n\nHe died in Lisbon on 19 September 1934.\n\nManuel de Brito Camacho was the author of more than thirty volumes of published works, in particular narratives and descriptions of his homeland and life in the rural Baixo Alentejo. The strong presence of rural Alentejan imagery were so common in his works that Aquilino Ribeiro titled his study of the politicians life Brito Camacho nas Letras e no Seu Monte (\"Brito Camacho in Letters and on His Mountain\"). In addition to several journalistic writings and political commentaries, Brito Camacho is the author of:\n\n\nOn 29 October 1987, during an official visit, the President of the Republic Mário Soares unveiled a commemorative plaque in Brito Camacho's home in Aljustrel, where he had lived until his death. In 1999, the local school, where the young Manuel had attended, was renamed in his honor (\"Escola Básica Doutor Brito Camacho\").\n\n"}

She was appointed in 2006 as British Columbia's first Representative for Children and Youth, an independent position reporting to the Legislative Assembly. She was re-appointed to a second 5-year term in 2011. Turpel-Lafond was earlier the first Treaty Indian to be appointed to the judicial bench of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan. She was given leave to take the legislative position.\n\n\"Time Magazine\" has twice bestowed honours upon Turpel-Lafond, naming her as one of the '100 Global Leaders of Tomorrow' in 1994, and in 1999 as one of the 'Top 20 Canadian Leaders for the 21st Century'.\n\nMary Ellen Turpel was the youngest of four girls born to an ethnic Scottish mother and Cree father in Niagara Falls, Ontario. She grew up in poverty, enduring harsh physical mistreatment, and lived with domestic violence and alcoholism in her home. Her upbringing was similar to that of many of the indigenous children she has since encountered through her work.\n\nBy age 18, she had entered Carleton University, Ottawa, gravitating from the study of math and science to politics, philosophy, and eventually the law. Turpel-Lafond holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton University, a law degree from Osgoode Hall, a master's degree in international law from the University of Cambridge, and a doctorate of law from Harvard Law School. She also studied the International Comparative Law of Human Rights at the University of Strasbourg.\n\nEnrolled as a member of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation, at age 35 Turpel-Lafond was the first Treaty Indian to be named to the judicial bench in Saskatchewan. She was the Administrative Judge for Saskatoon, involved in the administration of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan in relation to access to justice, judicial independence projects, technology and public outreach.\n\nShe has also worked as a criminal law judge in youth and adult courts, which led her to work at developing partnerships to better serve the needs of young people in the justice system, particularly sexually exploited children and youth, and children and youth with disabilities, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.\n\nPrior to her judicial appointment, Turpel-Lafond was a lawyer in Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. She is a tenured professor of law at Dalhousie University Faculty of Law. She occasionally lectured at the University of Toronto, the University of Notre Dame and other universities, and held the position of Aboriginal Scholar at the University of Saskatchewan. She has been a visiting professor at the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria law schools.\n\nIn November 2006, Turpel-Lafond was appointed to a five-year term as British Columbia's first Representative for Children and Youth. Her responsibilities include; advocating for children and youth, protecting their rights, and improving the system for their protection and support, particularly those who are most vulnerable. She serves all British Columbians under the age of 19, with an emphasis on young people in government care – such as those in foster homes, group homes or youth custody. These children and youth face greater challenges than those in the general population, especially related to health and education, incarceration and dependence on income assistance.\n\nTurpel-Lafond was appointed to a second term in late 2011. In 2015 she called for the government to hire immediately at least 250 social workers for indigenous children, in order to provide needed services and protect vulnerable children. She said that due to turnover, government hiring had resulted in a minor increase in the number of social workers to care for children. \nAs the Representative, she does not work for the executive branch of government. Rather, the Representative for Children and Youth is an independent office of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia and does not report through a provincial ministry. Their work is based on the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child, and upholds the following values:\n\n– Children have a right to be protected and kept safe\n– Families are the best environment for raising a child\n– Parents and extended family have the primary responsibility for a child\n– Decisions made about a child should include their own views and input\n\nAs a practicing lawyer, Turpel-Lafond has appeared before all levels of Courts in Canada, including the Supreme Court of Canada. Turpel-Lafond has worked on land claims with the Indian Law Resource Center in Washington, D.C., and served as a key legal and constitutional adviser to aboriginal leaders.\n\nIn 2018, Turpel-Lafond joined the Peter A. Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia as professor and was subsequently named the inaugural director of the University of British Columbia's Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre.\n\nTurpel-Lafond lives in Victoria, B.C., with her second husband George Lafond, who is a former Vice-Chief and Tribal Chief of the Saskatoon Tribal Council. They have a son and three daughters, including one set of twins.\n\n\"People are very resilient, children are resilient, and support for children makes a massive difference,\" Turpel-Lafond says. \"Look at my life.\" \n\n"}

Matt has two half-sisters, Annie (whose father is Sean and mother is Julia) and Emme Lowell (daughter of Christian with a woman named Darlene Lowell) and a younger half-brother, Conor (son of Sean and Julia). He is approximately 16 years of age at the beginning of the show's first season. Although he is not as much of a ruffian in the beginning, it is implied that he was a delinquent in his early years, as Sean says to Christian, \"I've spent too many years trying to corral your bad genetics\".\n\nMatt worries about sex with his girlfriend, Vanessa, and her possible reaction to his foreskin. He tells his parents that he wants to have a circumcision; Sean declines to perform the procedure, telling Matt there is nothing wrong with not being circumcised. However, when Vanessa is turned off, Matt decides to circumcise himself after reading a 'how-to guide' on the Internet. Unsurprisingly, his attempt goes wrong and Sean and Christian are forced to perform the operation properly. After the surgery, Matt discovers that Vanessa was not turned off by his foreskin but is in fact a lesbian and having an affair with a popular cheerleader, Ridley. When Ridley shows signs of wanting to end their affair, Vanessa asks Matt to have a threesome with them to keep Ridley interested. The threesomes continue, until Sean and Julia find out and have a family intervention with Ridley and Vanessa's parents. Weeks later, Matt and his friend Henry commit a hit and run while under the influence of marijuana. Both cover up their involvement, but both grow attached to the victim, an outsider whose strict Christian Scientist mother won't allow her to have the necessary surgery to repair her injuries.\n\nHenry is arrested and charged for the hit and run, and Matt testifies against him in court, claiming he was not in the car at the time of the accident. Meanwhile, Sean and Julia worry about his attitude and ask him to visit life coach Ava Moore. As part of a trust exercise, Ava asks Matt to take a naked photograph of her, and later offers him sexual intercourse in return for good grades. Matt and Ava sleep together, and Matt discovers that she has a teenage son, Adrian. Meanwhile, Sean, Julia and Christian all discover Ava's duplicitous, dangerous nature, and Christian takes it upon himself (due to recently discovering he is Matt's biological father) to try to keep Matt away from her after catching him masturbating outside of her window. Matt eventually discovers the truth about his paternity, shattering his relationship with Sean. Adrian begins to display disturbing behavior (stemming from his incestuous relationship with Ava) and runs away from home, while Matt wants to run away with Ava to Paris, France. Sean, Julia and Christian discover that Ava is a MTF transsexual and in return for enhanced vaginal surgery, Ava promises to leave Matt. As she packs, Adrian shows up and kills himself in front of Ava, who leaves his body and flees to Paris.\n\nMatt discovers Adrian's body and discovers that Ava used to be a man, pushing him to the edge of total insanity. He visits a transsexual bar and picks up a woman named Cherry Peck. When he discovers that she is a pre-op transsexual, he physically attacks her. In revenge, Cherry and her friends chase after Matt and after they beat him up, they urinate on him. Before the incident, Matt shaves his head and taunts Sean. Sean punches Matt, so he files a restraining order against his father. The court order is later dropped, but Sean and Matt continue to be on bad terms. Matt starts dating Ariel Alderman who, along with the rest of her family, are Neo-Nazis. Matt watches as Ariel bleaches her skin and listens to her racist beliefs. Meanwhile, Cherry comes to McNamara/Troy and asks them to fix her botched plastic surgery for free, as Matt beat her up. Sean is against it, as Cherry and her friends attacked him too. Having an epiphany, Matt encourages Sean to operate on Cherry and he befriends her. Things spiral out of control when the Alderman family spot Matt and Cherry together and kidnap them. Ariel's father, Mr. Alderman, forces Matt to either cut off his penis, or Cherry's. Cherry tells Matt that it is okay, and Matt presumably cuts it off. Mr. Alderman then drives Matt and Cherry to wasteland outside Miami and forces Matt to bury Cherry alive. But Matt stands up to Mr. Alderman at gunpoint and Cherry hits Mr Alderman from behind with a shovel, then shoots him.\n\nAfter the traumatic events of last season, Matt is having a hard time coping and turns to exercise as an outlet while isolating himself from everyone. It was revealed that Mr. Alderman survived the assault and is currently in prison. Matt runs into Kimber Henry at the gym, and learns about her religion of Scientology. Hoping that the religion will help him deal with his guilt, he joins - but it soon becomes more of an excuse to see Kimber. Kimber encourages Matt to move out of the McNamara home due to it being \"toxic\", and ends up cleaning roadsides as part of his religious training. After being rejected by Christian, Kimber tries to get back at him by sleeping with Matt. Several weeks later, Matt and Kimber tell Sean and Christian that they are married and expecting a baby. The couple move in together and Matt films a porn movie with her in an effort to spice up their sex life. Matt confesses to Sean that he knows Kimber only married him to get back at Christian, but he really does love her.\n\nMatt shows up in Los Angeles with newborn baby Jenna. He claims that he is now poor as Kimber gave all their money to Scientology, and that he has left her. In truth, this is nothing but a ruse to get money to pay for his and Kimber's spiraling addiction to crystal meth. Kimber tries to return to the porn industry, but is shot down by producer Ram Peters due to her habit. He does, however, want Matt in a gay porn movie after seeing the size of his penis in the homemade porn movie they made last year. Matt is willing to do the movie, until Kimber stops him. After quitting drugs through Scientology, Kimber agrees to dump Matt in return for surgery on her meth-ravaged face and teeth. Kimber tells Matt that she never loved him and moves in with Ram, taking Jenna with her. Matt later confronts Christian about it. Christian gets mad and disowns him until he grows up. Devastated, Matt turns to meth and accidentally blows up the motel he is staying in, inflicting severe burns on his body. While resting in hospital, Matt bonds with his burns counselor, Rachel Ben Natan, who was left horrifically scarred when a terrorist in her native Israel blew up right next to her. Matt and Rachel start dating, until Rachel ends things as she cannot see a future with him. Matt yells at her for daring to be \"picky\", and that she should consider herself lucky to be with him. Matt meets one of Christian's patients, Southern girl Emme Lowell, and sleeps with her. Matt and Emme feel a connection like none they have ever felt before. This is explained when Emme reveals that she came to Los Angeles to find her biological father: Christian Troy. Matt and Emme come clean to their parents about their love, and are told to end things immediately. Emme plans to return home, but despite his feelings Matt makes the right decision and lets her go. While helping Sean with his physical therapy, Matt revealed that he wanted to go into medicine, and that he was taking pre-med courses at a local community college. A few episodes later, Matt realizes he only wants to play a doctor on television, and goes into acting.\n\nIn the season six premiere, Matt tells Sean and Christian that he has been taking miming classes and plans to perform as a mime as a living. Christian openly derides Matt for this and tells him to get a real job. After a horrific day in which he is both robbed of the little money he has earned and his stereo—Matt reaches his breaking point when he attempts to purchase coffee from a coffee shop employee and pulls out a fake handgun which terrifies the employee, and she hands over all the money in the register. Matt then decides to use this disguise to rob other places; he is eventually known as \"The Mime\" after robbing several stores.\n\nAfter being released from a line-up by the police (the witness failed to identify Matt) and interrogated by his fathers who have become suspicious of his newfound wealth, Matt only becomes more reckless and arrogant with his criminal lifestyle. However, he is severely wounded while attempting to rob another convenience store when the clerk pulls out a shotgun and fires it at him. He makes it to Christian's place and collapses on the floor; he removes his jacket and shows that he is severely wounded. After treating Matt's wounds, Julia, Sean and Christian come to the realization that despite all their attempts, Matt will never change (with Christian seeming to take it the worst, blaming his amoral and rapist father for passing those genes on) and that he should be turned in to the police.\n\nMatt, who heard Julia and Christian talking, leaves soon after and breaks into Kimber's home to see his daughter. Kimber catches him, and after learning that he is leaving for Mexico, she begs to go with him. However, at a truck stop, Matt encounters Christian who tells him that Kimber helped slow him down long enough for Christian to find him and pleads with him to turn himself in. Matt pulls out a handgun and fires it at Christian to get him out (the round shatters the driver side window). Matt leaves but ruptures his stitches and calls Sean, who comes to help him. After stitching his son up, Matt leaves and finds the police and Christian waiting outside. Matt is handcuffed and read his Miranda Rights as he is led to a squad car.\n\nAt the urging of his grandmother Erica, the imprisoned Matt decides to be a witness in regards to Sean and Julia being unfit parents after Erica decides to petition for custody of Annie and Connor after Sean's suicide attempt. She also urges Matt to become a \"prison bitch\" to survive inside, as she believes he will not survive otherwise. When Christian goes to the prison to visit Matt, he is greeted instead by Matt's cellmate, who plans on turning Matt into his \"bitch\" in exchange for his protection, and tells Christian that Matt has agreed to get breast implants. A shocked Christian leaves, and makes an arrangement with the warden to have Matt transferred to another cell (selling his beloved boat to raise enough cash), however Matt's former cellmate is transferred as well and savagely beats Matt. Visiting Matt in the prison hospital, Christian refuses to perform the surgery on Matt but instead offers him another option; drugging his cellmate's food with drugs used for chemical castration (thus making it impossible for him to rape Matt). This works for a time, until Matt accidentally drops the bottle (which was hidden in a hollowed-out book) and his cellmate realizes what has been happening to him. He tries to rape Matt with a plunger that is in the cell, and Matt fights back by kicking him in the testicles and then strangling him with the lingerie his cellmate had bought for him.\n\nA little later, in exchange for performing liposuction on a super-obese death row inmate, Wesley Clovis (to ensure that the execution is successful), Sean and Christian make a deal that Matt is to be released from prison early. As the execution draws near, another inmate confronts Matt and tells him that Clovis is in fact innocent. As Matt is released in preparation for the execution, he begins to tell Sean and Christian about Clovis's innocence. However, realizing that this revelation will cost him his freedom, Matt quickly changes his mind, instead saying that he thinks Clovis is sick, disturbed, has no chance at rehabilitation, and that executing him is the right thing to do. Clovis is executed and Matt is released from prison.\n\nMatt goes to work in a carpet shop after being released from prison, where he falls in love with the manager, Ramona. During a therapy session with Christian and Sean, Matt and Ramona tell them that they will soon be married, and that Matt does not want to see them anymore.\n\nEverything seems fine between Matt and Ramona until Ava comes back into Matt's life in the series penultimate episode. On the couple's wedding day, Matt gets a text message and goes outside, where Ava is waiting for him in a limo. They drive away as Sean watches.\n\nIn the final episode of the series, Matt tells Sean and Christian that he and Ava plan on going to Brazil to find a suitable surgeon to operate on Raphael, Ava's adopted son. Christian later meets Ava and tells her that he will perform the surgery, provided she ends her relationship with Matt and leaves. Ava says that she loves Matt, but Christian believes she is just using him.\n\nLater, while Christian and Sean perform the surgery, Ava tells Matt that she does not want anything to do with him and that she never loved him. This devastates Matt. After the surgery is completed, Ava abandons Raphael when she learns that he will have permanent scarring from the procedure.\n\nThat night, Matt goes to Christian's apartment to pick up his daughter, where he has a discussion with Christian about what it means to be a father. Christian tells him that it means sacrificing everything for your kids, and that he does not think Matt is capable of doing that. Matt says that he knows he can be a good father, and that he wants to make Christian proud of him. Matt tricks Christian into allowing him to leave with his daughter, Jenna, by lying and saying he and his ex-fiance, Ramona, are going to get married and be a family. In truth (as seen by the audience during his story to Christian), Ramona berated Matt for jilting her, spitting on him.\n\nFinally, as Ava is getting ready to leave, Matt approaches her at the airport. He says he has bought tickets and that he wants to go with her. Ava still says that she does not love him, but Matt says he can see \"the smoke\" in her eyes. He tells her that even though he has messed up, Jenna is a very good daughter, and she needs a good mother that she can look up to. He also goes on to say that he has always loved her and will always love her. Ava agrees to be with Matt. The three of them are later seen going up the escalator, getting ready to start their life together.\n"}

Meher Baba said she was the purest soul in the universe and that she loved him as he ought to be loved. He called her his \"Radha\" and said, \"She is my very breath without which I cannot live.\" Dr. Charles Haynes writes, \"Meher Baba indicated that the companion of the Avatar who most clearly exemplifies [the] height of love is his closest woman disciple. In this advent, she is Mehera: as Sita was to Rama, Radha to Krishna, Mary to Jesus, so Mehera is to Meher Baba.\" Her accounts of her life with Meher Baba are documented in the three volume chronicle, \"Mehera-Meher: A Divine Romance\", written by David Fenster, based on tape-recordings of Mehera he made during her lifetime.\n\nMehera met Meher Baba for the first time on October 15, 1922 at the age of 15 in the Sakori ashram of Upasni Maharaj during a visit with her mother, but did not come to stay with Baba permanently at Meherabad until 1924. Unique among Meher Baba's women mandali, Mehera was sequestered by Baba from contact with men. It was not until the late 1960s that Mehera J. Irani was permitted by Meher Baba to come out of her seclusion and meet some of the men mandali from a distance. On the porch at Meherazad, she simply folded her hands to them out of respect to their love for Baba and saluted them with \"Jai Baba!\"\n\nMehera was one of four women who accompanied Baba in his New Life period from 1949-1951.

{"id": "14516952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14516952", "title": "Metoac", "text": "Metoac\n\nMetoac was a term erroneously used to describe Native Americans on Long Island in New York state, in the belief that various bands on the island comprised distinct tribes. The amateur anthropologist and U.S. Congressman Silas Wood published a book in the 19th century mistakenly claiming that several American Indian tribes were distinct to Long Island, New York. He collectively called them the Metoac. Scholars now understand that these historic peoples were part of two major cultural groups: the Lenape and the Wappinger-Wangunk-Quinnipiac peoples, both part of the Algonquian languages family. \n\nModern scientific scholarship has shown that Native American peoples on the island belonged to two major language and cultural groups among the Algonquian peoples who occupied Atlantic coastal areas from Canada through the American South. The bands in the western part of Long Island were related to those Lenape who had previously settled in the territory East of the Hudson river, and were related to peoples in what is now western Connecticut. Those to the east were more related culturally and linguistically to the Algonquian tribes of New England across Long Island Sound, such as the Pequot. Wood (and earlier colonial settlers) often confused Indian place names, by which the bands were known, as the names for different \"tribes\" living there.\n\nWood may have derived his collective term from \"metau-hok\", the Algonquian word for the rough periwinkle, which played an important role in the economy of the region before and after the arrival of Europeans. Dutch colonists, some from New Netherland, were the primary European settlers in the early colonial era. The eastern part of the island was colonized by English settlers from southern New England. Indigenous populations declined significantly within a few decades of European contact, due to new infectious diseases to which they had no immunity. \n\nMany of the place names given by the Lenape and Pequot populations are still in use today. The Shinnecock Indian Nation, based in part of what is now Southampton, New York in Suffolk County, has gained federal recognition as a tribe and has a reservation there.\n\nThe Native American population on Long Island has been estimated at 10,000 at the time of first contact. They spoke two languages within the Algonquian language group, reflecting their different connections to mainland peoples. Native Americans in the west and in the central part of Long Island were Lenape. These people spoke one of the R-dialects of the Lenape language. Those Native Americans who lived on the east end of the island were related to the Pequot of eastern Connecticut, and they spoke a Y-dialect of the Mohegan-Montauk-Narragansett language.\n\nEuropean colonization of the region began in the 1620s, with Dutch colonists settling around the lower Hudson and western Long Island. From the north, the New England Confederation exerted influence on eastern Long Island and along its north shore. The western portion (including what are now the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens) were under the jurisdiction of New Netherland. \n\nThis separation between zones of Dutch and English influence was formalized in their Treaty of Hartford in 1650, which set a border running south from Oyster Bay. The Native Americans on Long Island played an important role in the trade economy; shells harvested there were fashioned into small beads to create sewant, or wampum (\"wampompeag\" - shortened later by the English). These were used to decorate ceremonial wear and were the most highly prized.\n\nThe Pequot War (1634–1638) in southern New England and Kieft's War (1643–1645) in the New York metropolitan area were two major conflicts between the indigenous peoples and the colonists. Exposure to new Eurasian infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, dramatically reduced the numbers of Native Americans on Long Island. In addition, some Native American settlements on Long Island migrated away under pressure from European encroachment. By 1659, their population was reduced to less than 500.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, their numbers were reduced to 162 people by 1788. By this time, Samson Occom had persuaded many survivors to join the Brothertown Indians in western upstate New York, where the Oneida people of the Iroquois Confederacy shared their reservation for several years. \n\nFor generations, colonists mistakenly used the place names as exonyms for peoples, thinking they referred to distinct tribes. Among the many locations on Long Island used by the native peoples, 19th-century American publications erroneously identified the following thirteen as \"tribes\" on Long Island:\n\nAt the end of 2009, the administration of President Barack Obama announced the Shinnecock Indian Nation had met the federal criteria for recognition as a tribe. The Shinnecock were recognized by the United States government in October 2010 after a more than 30-year effort, which included suing the Department of Interior. The Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, George T. Skibine, issued the final determination of the tribe's recognized status on June 13, 2010.\n\nNew York State has recognized the Shinnecock, based at Shinnecock Reservation near Southampton and the Unkechaug. The latter's Poospatuck Reservation at Mastic is the smallest Indian reservation in the state. The Montaukett, Setalcott, and Matinnecock are all seeking both state and federal recognition.\n"}

His story first appears in the Post-Vulgate Cycle. \n\nIn the Post-Vulgate, Pellias is the son of a poor vavasour who seeks the love of the high-born maiden, named Arcade or Archade. Though he wins her a golden circlet in a tournament, she spurns him, holes up in her castle refusing to see him, and sends her knights daily to humiliate him in hopes of driving him away. During the course of unrelated adventures, Sir Gawain, Arthur's nephew, witnesses Pellias's humiliation and vows to help him by going to Arcade wearing Pellias's armor, pretending to have killed him. Once in her confidences, Gawain plans to woo Arcade on behalf of Pellias, delivering her to him. Instead, Gawain falls for Arcade himself, his passion causing him to forget his promise to Pellias. When Gawain does not return with the maiden, Pellias seeks them out and finds them in bed together. Though distraught, Pellias cannot bring himself to kill them, so leaves his bare sword between them in the bed and returns home, where he says he will never leave his bed until he dies from grief. The next morning, Arcade recognizes the sword and Gawain remembers his promise. He convinces Arcade to love Pellias and arranges for them to meet. The pair marry and have a son, Guivret the Younger, who later becomes one of Arthur's knights. \n\nThomas Malory reworked the Post-Vulgate story in the first book of his \"Le Morte d'Arthur\". There, Gawain leaves the maiden—who in this version is called Ettarde—after the incident with the sword. Nimue, one of the Ladies of the Lake, comes upon Pelleas, hears his story, and falls in love with him herself. She takes vengeance on Ettarde by magic, enchanting her to fall in love with Pelleas as deeply as he loved her. Pelleas, whose love has turned to hate, spurns Ettarde, and she dies of sorrow. Nimue and Pelleas fall in love and marry and it is Nimue who becomes Guivret's mother.\n\nPelleas appears as a minor character at other points in these works, fighting in tournaments, and defending Guinevere from her abductor Maleagant as one of the Queen's Knights. \n\nHis story has continued to be popular with 19th and 20th century writers.\n\n\n"}

Dolan\n\nPhilip Jarvis Dolan (October 5, 1923 – January 5, 1992) graduated in physics from West Point in 1945, was assigned to the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, in 1948 received his MSc in physics from the University of Virginia in 1956. The son of a Professor of Military Science at Purdue University, Dolan served in the Korean War before holding U.S. Army posts ranging from 'Instructor in Nuclear Weapons Employment' to 'Nuclear Effects Project Officer'. He later worked for both Lockheed Corporation and SRI International.\n\nHe is best known as co-author with Samuel Glasstone of the well-known reference work \"The Effects of Nuclear Weapons\", as well as first editor of the two-part edition of the U.S. Department of Defense’s 1,651 pages 'Secret-Restricted Data' manual, \"Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons\" (DNA-EM-1, 1 July 1972).\n\nDolan also compiled the famous and controversial U.S. Army Field Manual, \"Nuclear Weapons Employment\", FM 101-31, in 1963. Professor Freeman Dyson commented on it in his 1984 book, \"Weapons and Hope:\"\n\n\"The military doctrines summarised in FM 101-31 were valid... when tactical nuclear wars might have been small-scale and truly limited. The handbook represents a sincere attempt to put Oppenheimer’s philosophy of local nuclear defence into practice.\"\n\nDr J. Robert Oppenheimer said of this nuclear weapons capabilities question:\n\n\"I am not qualified, and if I were qualified I would not be allowed, to give a detailed evaluation of the appropriateness of the use of atomic weapons against any or all such (military) targets; but one thing is very clear. It is clear that they can be used only as adjuncts in a military campaign which has some other components, and whose purpose is a military victory. They are not primarily weapons of totality or terror, but weapons used to give combat forces help they would otherwise lack. They are an integral part of military operations. Only when the atomic bomb is recognized as useful insofar as it is an integral part of military operations, will it really be of much help in the fighting of a war, rather than in warning all mankind to avert it.\" (Quotation: Samuel Cohen, \"Shame\", 2nd ed., 2005, page 99.)\n\nA detailed study of the collateral damage problems by Dolan and others resulted in the concept of the U.S. ‘Triad’ of nuclear silos, bombers and submarine missile platforms for ‘cross-targeting’ (using different delivery platforms; aircraft, submarines and missiles) and ‘layering’ (using repeated hits by accurate low yield weapons). These tactics limit the risk of failure, and also reduce individual bomb yields, thus preventing any serious collateral damage to nearby civilian areas (heavy fallout, blast, or fires). Dolan revealed in the \"Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons\", 1972 (c. 14: p. 1, declassified on 13 February 1989):\n\n\"One of the primary uses of nuclear weapons would be for the destruction of military field equipment.\"\n\nOther major targets discussed are missiles, ships, and submarines, but the longest chapter dealt with radiation dose prediction for human beings from the perspective of avoiding collateral damage, Chapter 10 \"Personnel Casualties\" is one of the shortest in the manual, containing only 38 out of the 1,651 pages). .\n\nPhilip J. Dolan contributed substantial discussions to two openly published books during the 1980s:\n\n\nThe strange title of this second book refers to the discovery that cockroaches will withstand 67,500 rem (American variety) or 90,000-105,000 rem (German variety), compared to a human lethal exposure of only about 800 rem . One theory which resulted from these observations on insects was that cockroaches, along with some simple plants and bacteria, would be likely to be the only lifeforms to survive a severe nuclear war. This theory was refuted by experience of the very rapid recovery on isolated islands exposed to close-in heavy fallout and other effects from massive hydrogen bombs at the Bikini Atoll and Eniwetok Atoll, as well as from smaller nuclear weapons in the Nevada Test Site and Australia (Montebello Islands, Maralinga and Emu Field). Full ecological recovery surveys were documented before and after each test series.

{"id": "911543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911543", "title": "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg", "text": "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg\n\nRobert Nikolaus Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg (, Baron Roman-Nikolai-Maksimilian (Roman Fyodorovich) von Ungern-Sternberg) (10 January 1886 NS – 15 September 1921) was an Austrian-born Russian anti-Bolshevik lieutenant general in the Russian Civil War and then an independent warlord whose Asiatic Cavalry Division wrested control of Mongolia from the Republic of China in 1921 after its occupation. He was often referred to as Baron Ungern, or simply Ungern. \n\nUngern was an arch-conservative pan-monarchist who aspired to restore the Russian monarchy under Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia and to revive the Mongol Empire under the rule of the Bogd Khan. During the Russian Civil War, Ungern's attraction to Vajrayana Buddhism and his eccentric, often violent treatment of enemies and his own men, earned him the sobriquet \"the Mad Baron\". In February 1921 he expelled Chinese troops from Mongolia and restored the monarchic power of the Bogd Khan. During his five-month occupation of Outer Mongolia, Ungern imposed order on the capital city, Ikh Khüree (now Ulaanbaatar), through fear, intimidation, and brutal violence against his opponents, particularly Bolshevik supporters.\n\nIn June 1921 he went on to invade east Siberia in support of supposed anti-Bolshevik rebellions and to head off a Red Army-Mongolian partisan invasion; this action led to his defeat and capture two months later. He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and a month later put on trial for counterrevolution in Novonikolaevsk. After a six-hour trial he was found guilty, and on 15 September 1921 he was executed.\n\nRobert Nikolaus Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg was born in Graz, Austria, in 1886 to a noble Baltic-German family. The Ungern-Sternberg family settled in what is now Estonia during the Middle Ages. Ungern-Sternberg's first language was German, but he was also fluent in French, Russian, English and Estonian. His mother was a German noblewoman named Sophie Charlotte von Wimpffen, later Sophie Charlotte von Ungern-Sternberg, and his father was Theodor Leonhard Rudolph Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg (1857–1918). He also had Hungarian roots, and claimed descent from Batu Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson, which played a role in his dream of reviving the Mongol Empire.\n\nIn 1888 his family moved to Reval (Tallinn), the capital of the Governorate of Estonia within the Russian Empire, where his parents divorced in 1891. In 1894 his mother married Baltic German nobleman Oskar Anselm Hermann Freiherr von Hoyningen-Huene. Ungern-Sternberg grew up in the Governatorate, with his home being the Hoyningen-Huene estate at Jerwakant (modern Järvakandi, Estonia) that was set deep in the forests about 40 miles from Reval. In the summer Ungern-Sternberg lived on the island of Dago (modern Hiiumaa) in the Baltic, which he liked to boast had belonged to his family for over 200 years.\nAs a boy, Ungern-Sternberg was noted for being such a ferocious bully that even the other bullies feared him and several parents forbid their children from playing with him as he was a \"terror\". Ungern was well known for his love of torturing animals and at the age of 12 tried to strangle to death his cousin's pet owl for no particular good reason other than his cruelty towards animals. Ungern-Sternberg had an extreme pride in his ancient, aristocratic family, later writing that his family had over the centuries \"never taken orders from the working classes\" and it was outrageous that \"dirty workers who've never had any servants of their own, but still think they can command\" should have any say in the ruling of the vast Russian Empire.\nUngern-Sternberg, despite his pride of German origin, identified himself very strongly with the Russian Empire. When asked if his \"family had distinguished itself in Russian service\", Ungern proudly answered: \"Seventy-two killed in wartime!\". Ungern-Sternberg believed that return to monarchies in Europe was possible with the aid of \"cavalry people\", meaning Russian Cossacks, Buryats, Tatars, Mongols, Kyrgyz, Kalmyks, etc.\n\nIn 1898 his father was briefly imprisoned for fraud and in 1899 was committed to the local insane asylum. From 1900–02 Ungern attended the Nicholas I Gymnasium in Reval. His school records show that he was an unruly, bad-tempered young man who was constantly in trouble with his teachers owing to frequent fights with other cadets and breaking other school rules—smoking in bed, growing long hair, leaving without permission, etc.—which finally led to the schoolmaster writing a letter in February 1905 to his stepfather and mother, asking them to withdraw him from the school, otherwise he would be expelled. In 1905 he left the school to join the fighting in eastern Russia during the Russo-Japanese War, but it is unclear whether he participated in operations against the Japanese or if all military operations had ceased before his arrival in Manchuria, although he was awarded the Russo-Japanese War Medal in 1913.\n\nIn 1905 Russia exploded into revolution, and in the Governatorate Estonian peasants went on a bloody \"jacquerie\" against the Baltic-German nobility, which owned most of the land there, lynching aristocrats and burning down their estates. One of the estates burned down was the one at Jerwakant where Ungern-Sternberg had grown up. The revolution of 1905 and the destruction of the Jerwakant estate were huge traumas to Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the \"jacquerie\" as confirming his belief that the Estonian peasants who worked on his family's lands were all \"rough, untutored, wild and constantly angry, hating everybody and everything without understanding why\".\n\nIn 1906 Ungern was transferred to service in the Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg as a cadet of ordinary rank. As an army cadet he proved to be a better student than he ever was as a naval cadet, and he actually studied his course material, though in the words of Palmer Ungern was a \"mediocre student\" at best. During the same period Ungern-Sternberg had become obsessed with the occult and was especially interested in Buddhism. His cousin Count Hermann von Keyserling, who knew him well later, wrote that the baron was very curious from his teenage years onward with \"Tibetan and Hindu philosophy\" and often spoke of the mystical powers possessed by \"geometrical symbols\". Keyserling called Ungern-Sternberg \"one of the most metaphysically and occultly gifted men I have ever met\" and believed that the baron was a clairvoyant who could read the minds of the people around him. Later, in Mongolia, Ungern became a Buddhist but did not leave the Lutheran faith. There is a widespread view that he was viewed by Mongols as the incarnation of the \"God of War\" (the figure of Jamsaran in Tibetan and Mongol folklore). Although many Mongols may have believed him to be a deity, or at the very least a re-incarnation of Genghis Khan, Ungern was never officially proclaimed to be any of these incarnations.\n\nAfter graduating he served as an officer in east Siberia in the 1st Argunsky and then in the 1st Amursky Cossack regiments, where he became enthralled with the lifestyle of nomadic peoples such as the Mongols and Buryats. Ungern had specifically asked that he be stationed with a Cossack regiment in Asia, as he wanted to learn more about Asian culture, a request that was granted. During this period Ungern-Sternberg was notorious for his heavy drinking and exceptionally cantankerous moods. In one such brawl his face was scarred when the officer he was fighting with struck him with his sword, leaving him with a distinctive facial scar. It has been claimed that the sword blow that caused the scar also caused brain damage that was the root of Ungern's insanity. However, a special study revealed that Ungern-Sternberg was not mentally insane, although the wound affected his irritability. Those who knew him well described him as very drawn towards \"Eastern culture\", as he was fascinated by Asian cultures, especially that of the Mongols and the Buryats. At the same time Ungern was an excellent horseman who earned the respect of the Mongols and the Buryats due to his skill at riding and fighting from a horse, being equally adept at using both a gun and his sword. In 1913, at his request, he transferred to the reserves. Ungern moved to Outer Mongolia to assist Mongols in their struggle for independence from China, but Russian officials prevented him from fighting with Mongolian troops. He arrived in the town of Khovd in western Mongolia and served as out-of-staff officer in the Cossack guard detachment at the Russian consulate.\n\nOn 19 July 1914, Ungern joined front-line forces as part of the second-turn 34th Regiment of Cossack troops stationed on the Austrian frontier in Galicia. He took part in the Russian offensive in East Prussia and from 1915–16 also participated in rear-action raids on German troops by the L.N. Punin Cavalry Special Task Force. Ungern served in the Nerchinsky Regiment. Throughout the war on the Eastern Front he gained a reputation as an extremely brave—but somewhat reckless and mentally unstable—officer, a man with no fear of death who seemed most happy leading cavalry charges or being in the thick of combat. He was decorated with several military awards: orders of St. George of the 4th grade, St. Vladimir of the 4th grade, St. Anna of the 3rd and 4th grades, as well as St. Stanislas of the 3rd grade. Despite his many awards, he was eventually discharged from one of his command positions for attacking another officer and a hall porter during a drunken rage in October 1916, which led to his being court-martialed and sentenced to two months in prison. Gen. Wrangel mentions Ungern's determination in his memoirs.\n\nAfter his release from prison in January 1917, Ungern was transferred to the Caucasian theatre of the conflict, where Russia was fighting against the Ottoman Empire. The February Revolution that ended the rule of the House of Romanov was an extremely bitter blow to the monarchist Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the revolution as the beginning of the end of Russia. In the Caucasus Ungern-Sternberg first met Cossack Capt. Grigory Semyonov, later one of most well-known Russian anti-communist warlords in Siberia. In April 1917 near Urmia, Iran, Ungern, together with Semyonov, started to organize a volunteer military unit composed of local Assyrian Christians. The Ottoman government had waged the Assyrian Genocide, attempting to exterminate the Assyrian minority, which led to thousands of Assyrians fleeing to the Russian lines. Ungern and Semyonov conceived of a scheme under which the two would organize and lead Assyrian troops to serve as an example for the Russian army, which was being demoralized by the revolutionary mood. Under Ungern's command his Assyrians went on to score some minor victories over the Turks, but their total contribution to Russia's war effort was limited. Afterwards, the Assyrian scheme led Semyonov to the idea of placing Buryat troops in Siberia. The Kerensky government gave its approval to Semyonov's plans, and Ungern-Sternberg soon headed east to join his friend in trying to raise a Buryat regiment.\n\nAfter the Bolshevik-led October Revolution of 1917, Semyonov and Ungern declared their allegiance to the Romanovs and vowed to fight the revolutionaries. In late 1917 Ungern, Semyonov and five Cossacks peacefully disarmed a group of about 1500 pro-Red combatants on a railway station in Manchuria on the China-Eastern Railway (FER) in China near the Russian border. For a time the station in Manchuria was a stronghold of Semyonov and Ungern in their preparations for war in Transbaikal. They started to enroll troops in a Special Manchurian Regiment, which became a nucleus for anti-communist forces led by Semyonov.\n\nAfter the White troops defeated the Reds on a section of the FER line in Russia, Semyonov appointed Ungern commandant of troops stationed in Dauria, a railway station in a strategic position east-southeast of Lake Baikal. Semyonov and Ungern, though fervently anti-Bolshevik, were not typical of the figures to be found in the leadership of the White movement, as their plans differed from those of the main White leaders. Semyonov refused to recognize the authority of Adm. Aleksandr Kolchak, the nominal leader of the Whites in Siberia. Instead, he acted independently, supported by the Japanese with arms and money. For White leaders like Kolchak and Denikin, who believed in a \"Russia strong and indivisible\", this represented high treason. Ungern was nominally subordinated to Semyonov but he, too, often acted independently. Adm. Kolchak was a conservative but not a monarchist, who promised that after the victory of the Whites he would reconvene the Constituent Assembly disbanded by the Bolsheviks in January 1918, which would then decide the future of Russia, including the question of whether or not to restore the monarchy. Ungern, to the contrary, believed that monarchs were accountable only to God, and the monarchy was the political system that God had chosen for Russia, so it was self-evident that it should be restored to the way it had existed before the October Manifesto of 1905. For Ungern, the opinions of the people of Russia were irrelevant, as monarchs were not accountable to the people.\n\nBecause of his successful military operations in Hailar and Dauria, Ungern received the rank of Major-General. Semyonov entrusted him with forming military units to battle Bolshevik forces. They enrolled Buryats and Mongols in their national military units. In Dauria, Ungern formed the volunteer Asiatic Cavalry Division (Russian: Азиатская конная дивизия), which included Russians, Buryats, Tatars, Bashkirs, Mongols from different tribes, Chinese, Manchu, Polish exiles and many others. Ungern reinforced his military station at Dauria, creating a kind of fortress from which his troops launched attacks on Red forces. Under his rule, Dauria became a well-known \"torture center\" filled with the bones of dozens of Ungern's victims, people who were executed because of accusations of being Reds or thieves (details in ). Ungern's chief executioner had been a Col. Laurentz, but later, in Mongolia, Ungern had him executed because he lost Ungern's trust, although under unclear circumstances. Like many other White units, Ungern's troops employed \"requisitions\" as a source of their supply. They examined trains passing through Dauria to Manchuria. While these confiscations did not significantly diminish the supplies of Kolchak's forces, private Russian and Chinese merchants lost considerable property.\n\nIn 1919, taking advantage of the weakness of Russia's government caused by revolutions and civil war, the Chinese government, established by members of the Anhui military party, sent troops led by Gen. Xu Shuzheng to join Outer Mongolia to China and end its autonomy. This violated the terms of a tripartite Russian-Mongolian-Chinese agreement concluded in 1915, which secured the autonomy of Outer Mongolia and did not allow the presence of Chinese troops, except for small numbers of consular guards. Although the Anhui party was supported by Japan, indications that Japan inspired Chinese occupation of Outer Mongolia have not yet been confirmed by documents. After the fall of Anhui party rule in China, Chinese soldiers in Mongolia found themselves effectively abandoned. They rebelled against their commanders and plundered and killed Mongols and foreigners. Some of the Chinese troops during the occupation were Tsahar (Chahar) Mongols from Inner Mongolia, who had been a major cause of animosity between Outer Mongols (Khalkhas) and Inner Mongols.\n\nAs part of his plans, Ungern traveled to Manchuria and China (February through September 1919). There he established contacts with monarchist circles and also made preparations for Semyonov to meet with Manchurian warlord Marshal Zhang Zuolin, the \"Old Marshal\". In July 1919 Ungern married Manchurian princess Ji in an Orthodox ceremony in Harbin. The princess was given the name Elena Pavlovna. She and Ungern communicated in English, their only common language. This marriage had a political aim, as Ji was a princess and a relative of Gen. Zhang Kuiwu, commander of Chinese troops at the western end of the Chinese-Manchurian Railway, and governor of Hailar.\n\nAfter Kolchak's defeat at the hands of the Red Army and the subsequent decision of Japan to withdraw its expeditionary troops from the Transbaikal, Semyonov, unable to withstand the pressure of Bolshevik forces, planned a retreat to Manchuria. Ungern, however, saw this as an opportunity to implement his monarchistic plan. On 7 August 1920 he broke his allegiance to Semyonov and transformed his Asiatic Cavalry Division into a guerrilla detachment. Ungern's troops started to move towards the border of Outer Mongolia. They crossed the northern border of Outer Mongolia on 1 October 1920 and moved southwest. Having crossed the Mongolian border, Ungern moved westwards to the Mongolian capital of Urga (officially Niislel Khuree, now Ulaanbaatar). He entered into negotiations with Chinese occupying forces. All of his demands, including disarmament of the Chinese troops, were rejected. On 26–27 October and again on 2–4 November 1920, Ungern's troops assaulted Urga, but suffered disastrous losses. After the defeat his forces retreated to the upper currents of the Kherlen River, in Setsen-Khan Aimag (district ruled by princes with the title Setsen Khan), in eastern Outer Mongolia. He was supported by Mongols who sought independence from Chinese occupation, especially the spiritual and secular leader of Mongols, the Bogd Khan, who secretly sent Ungern his blessing for expelling Chinese from Mongolia. The Chinese had tightened their control of Outer Mongolia by this time, strictly regulating Buddhist services in monasteries and imprisoning Russians and Mongols whom they considered \"separatists\". According to memoirs by M.G. Tornovsky, the Asiatic Division numbered 1,460 men, while the Chinese garrison was 7000 strong. The Chinese had the advantage in artillery and machine guns and had built a network of trenches in and around Urga. At his camp Ungern imposed ferocious discipline on his Russian soldiers to prevent desertion and demoralization.\n\nUngern's troops began moving from their camp to Urga on 31 January. On 2 February they battled for control of Chinese front lines and secured parts of Urga. His detachment, led by B.P. Rezukhin, captured Chinese front-line fortifications near Small Madachan and Big Madachan settlements in the southeastern vicinities of Urga. During the battle Ungern's special detachment of Tibetans, Mongols, Buryats and Russians rescued the Bogd Khan from house arrest and transported him through the Bogd Uul to Manjushri Monastery. At the same time another detachment moved to the mountains east of Urga. On 3 February he gave his soldiers a respite. Borrowing a tactic from Genghis Khan, he ordered his troops to light a large number of campfires in the hills surrounding Urga, using them as reference points for Rezukhin's detachment. This made the town appear to be surrounded by an overwhelming force. Early on 4 February Ungern launched an assault on the Chinese White barracks from the east and captured them. Then he divided his forces in two parts. The first launched a major assault on the remaining Chinese positions in the Chinese trade settlement (, \"Maimaicheng\"). The second moved westwards towards the part of Urga called Consular Settlement. Upon reaching the Maimaicheng, Ungern had his men smash their way in by blasting the gates with explosives and improvised battering rams. After breaking in, a general slaughter set in, as both sides fought with sabers. After the capture of Maimacheng, Ungern joined his troops attacking Chinese troops at the Consular Settlement. After a Chinese counterattack, Ungern's soldiers retreated a short distance northeast and then launched another attack with the support of another Cossack and Mongolian detachment, which began an attack from the northeast and northwest. Ungern's troops gradually moved westwards in Urga, pursuing retreating Chinese soldiers. The capital city was finally taken on the evening of 4 February. Chinese civilian administrators and military commanders abandoned their soldiers and fled northwards from Urga on 11 cars on the night of 3–4 February. Chinese troops fled northward on 4 and 5 February. They massacred any Mongolian civilians they encountered along the road from Urga to the Russian border. Russian settlers who supported the Reds moved from Urga together with the fleeing Chinese troops. During the capture of Urga the Chinese lost about 1500 men, while Ungern's forces suffered about 60 casualties.\n\nAfter the battle, Ungern's troops began plundering Chinese stores and killing Russian Jews who were living in Urga, as the Cossacks had also been set against the Jews. Ungern himself ordered the Jews to be killed, except for those who had notes from him sparing their lives. It has been estimated by surviving archival documents and memoirs that 43–50 Jews were killed during Ungern's stay in Mongolia, or about 5%–6% of all those executed under his orders. Several days later the looting by his troops was stopped by Ungern, but his secret-police bureau led by Col. Leonid Sipailo continued searching for \"Reds\". Between 11–13 March Ungern captured a fortified Chinese base at Choir between the mountains Otsol Uul and Choiryn Bogd Uul to the south of Urga. Ungern had 900 troops and the Chinese defenders about 1500. After capturing Choir Ungern himself returned to Urga. His detachments, consisting of Cossacks and Mongols, moved southward to Zamyn-Üüd, a frontier settlement and another Chinese base. The defending Chinese soldiers abandoned Zamyn-Üüd without a fight.\n\nWhen the remaining Chinese troops, having retreated to northern Mongolia near Kyakhta, attempted to round Urga to the west in order to reach China, the Russians and Mongols feared they were attempting to re-capture Urga. Several hundred Cossack and Mongol troops were dispatched to stop the Chinese forces, which numbered several thousand, in the area of Talyn Ulaankhad Hill near the Urga–Uliastai road in central Mongolia. After a battle that raged from 30 March to 2 April, in which more than 1000 Chinese and approximately 100 Mongols, Russians and Buryats were killed, the Chinese were routed and chased to the southern border of the country. Thus Chinese forces left Outer Mongolia.\n\nUngern, Mongolian lamas and princes brought the Bogd Khan from Manjusri Monastery to Urga on 21 February 1921. On 22 February a solemn ceremony took place, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne. As a reward for ousting the Chinese from Urga, the Bogd Khan granted Ungern the high hereditary title \"darkhan khoshoi chin wang\" in the degree of \"khan\", and other privileges. Other officers, lamas and princes who had participated in these events also received high titles and awards.\nFor seizing Urga, Ungern received from Semyonov the rank of Lieutenant-General. \n\nOn 22 February 1921, Mongolia was proclaimed an independent monarchy. Supreme power over Mongolia belonged to the Bogd Khan, or the 8th Bogd Gegen Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. According to some eyewitnesses (among them his engineer and officer Kamil Giżycki, and Polish adventurer and writer Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski), Ungern was the first to institute order in Urga, imposing street cleaning and sanitation and promoting religious life and tolerance in the capital, and attempting to reform the economy. Ossendowski, one of the most popular Polish writers in his lifetime (at the time of his death in 1945, his overseas sales were the second-highest of all the writers of Poland), had served as an official in Adm. Kolchak's government and after its collapse, fled to Mongolia. He became one of Ungern's very few friends and in 1922 published a best-selling book in English, \"Men, Beasts and Gods\", about his adventures in Siberia and Mongolia, which remains the book by which the Ungern story is best known in the English-speaking world. Comparison of Ossendowski's diary with his book and with documents on Mongolia revealed that his reports on Mongolia at Ungern are largely true, except for a few stories; Ossendowski was the first to describe Ungern's views in terms of Theosophy, although Ungern himself had never been a Theosophist.\n\nUngern did not interfere in Mongolian affairs and only assisted Mongols with some issues according to orders of the Bogd Khan. Russian colonists, on the other hand, suffered cruelties from Ungern's secret-police bureau led by Leonid Sipailo. Many innocent people were tortured and killed by Sipailo and his subordinates. A list of people known to have been killed on Ungern's orders or by others on their pretext, both in Russia and Mongolia, confirms the deaths of 846 people, approximately 100–120 from Urga, which was about 3%–8% of the total foreign colony population.\n\nSome eyewitnesses considered his Asiatic Cavalry Division as a base for a future Mongolian national army. This division consisted of national detachments, such as the Chinese regiment, Japanese unit, various Cossack regiments, Mongol, Buryat, Tatar and other peoples' units. Ungern said that 16 nationalities served in his division. Dozens of Tibetans also served as part of his troops. They might have been sent by 13th Dalai Lama, with whom Ungern communicated, or these Tibetans may have belonged to the Tibetan colony in Urga. The presence of the Japanese unit in the division is often explained as an evidence that Japan stood behind Ungern in his actions in Mongolia. Studies of interrogations of these people from Japanese archive revealed that they were mercenaries serving on their own, as other nationals in the division, and that Ungern was not managed by Japan.\n\nThe Bolsheviks started infiltrating Mongolia shortly after the October 1917 revolution, i.e., long before they took control of the Russian Transbaikal. In 1921 various Red Army units belonging to Soviet Russia and to the Far Eastern Republic invaded newly independent Mongolia to defeat Ungern. These forces included Red Mongolian leader Damdin Sükhbaatar. Spies and various smaller diversionary units went ahead to spread terror to weaken Ungern's forces. Ungern organized an expedition to meet these forces in Siberia and to support ongoing anti-Bolshevik rebellions. Believing he had the unwavering popular support of locals in Siberia and Mongolia, Ungern failed to properly strengthen his troops despite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Red forces. However, unbeknownst to Ungern, the Reds had successfully crushed uprisings in Siberia and Soviet economic policies had temporarily softened in Lenin's NEP. Upon Ungern's arrival in Siberia, few local peasants and Cossacks volunteered to join him.\n\nIn the spring the Asiatic Cavalry Division was divided into two brigades: one under the command of Lt. Gen. Ungern and the second under Maj. Gen. Rezukhin. In May Rezukhin's brigade launched a raid beyond the Russian border to the west of the Selenga River. Ungern's brigade left Urga and slowly moved to the Russian town of Troitskosavsk (present-day Kyakhta in Buryatia). Meanwhile, the Reds moved large numbers of troops towards Mongolia from different directions. They had a tremendous advantage in equipment (armored cars, airplanes, rail, gunboats, ammunition, human reserves, etc.) and in number of troops. As a result, Ungern was defeated in battles that took place between 11–13 June and he failed to capture Troitskosavsk. Combined Bolshevik and Red Mongol forces entered Urga on 6 July 1921, after a few small skirmishes with Ungern's guard detachments.\n\nAlthough they had captured Urga, the Red forces failed to defeat the main forces of the Asiatic Division (Ungern's and Rezukhin's brigades). Ungern regrouped and attempted to invade Transbaikal across the Russo-Mongolian border. To rally his soldiers and local people, he quoted an agreement with Grigory Semyonov and pointed to a supposed Japanese offensive that was to support their drive, although neither Semyonov nor the Japanese were eager to assist him. After several days rest, on 18 July the Asiatic Division started its raid into Soviet territory. Eyewitnesses Kamil Giżycki and Mikhail Tornovsky gave similar estimates of their numbers: about 3000 men in total. Ungern's troops penetrated deep into Russian territory. The Soviets declared martial law in areas where the Whites were expected, including Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatia). Ungern's troops captured many settlements, the northernmost being Novoselenginsk, which they occupied on 1 August. By this time Ungern understood that his offensive was ill-prepared; he also heard about the approach of large Red forces. On 2 August 1921 he began his retreat to Mongolia, where he declared his determination to fight Communism. While Ungern's troops wanted to abandon the war effort and head towards Manchuria to join with other Russian émigrés, it soon became clear that Ungern had other ideas. He wanted to retreat to Tuva, then to Tibet. Troops under both Ungern and Rezukhin effectively mutinied and hatched plots to kill their respective commanders. On 17 August Rezukhin was murdered. A day later conspirators unsuccessfully tried to assassinate Ungern. His command then collapsed as his brigade broke apart. On 20 August Ungern was captured by a Soviet detachment led by guerrilla commander P.E. Shchetinkin (later a member of the Cheka). After a show trial of six hours and 15 minutes on 15 September 1921, prosecuted by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, the Baron was sentenced to execution by firing squad. The sentence was carried out that night in Novonikolaevsk.\n\n\"When the news on the Baron's execution reached the Living Buddha [the Bogd Khan], he ordered services to be held in temples throughout Mongolia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Shuhada Organization was dedicated to the provision of health care to Afghan women and girls, training of medical staff and to education. In the following years further branches of the clinic/hospital were opened throughout Afghanistan.\n\nAfter living as refugee for over a decade, Samar returned to Afghanistan in 2002 to assume a cabinet post in the Afghan Transitional Administration led by Hamid Karzai. In the interim government, she served as Deputy President and then as Minister for Women's Affairs. She was forced into resignation from her post after she was threatened with death and harassed for questioning conservative Islamic laws, especially sharia law, during an interview in Canada with a Persian-language newspaper. During the 2003 Loya Jirga, several religious conservatives took out an advertisement in a local newspaper calling Samar the Salman Rushdie of Afghanistan.\n\nShe is currently the head of Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC).She established Gawharshad Institute of Higher Education in 2010, which has attracted more than 1200 students in a very short amount of its activities. She is one of the 4 main subjects in Sally Armstrong's 2004 documentary \"Daughters of Afghanistan\". In the documentary, Sima Samar's work as the Minister of Women's Affairs and her subsequent fall from power is shown.\n\nDr. Samar publicly refuses to accept that women must be kept in purdah (secluded from the public) and speaks out against the practice of wearing the burqa (head-to-foot wrap), which was enforced first by the fundamentalist mujahideen and then by the Taliban. She also has drawn attention to the fact that many women in Afghanistan suffer from osteomalacia, a softening of the bones, due to an inadequate diet. Wearing the burqa reduces exposure to sunlight and aggravates the situation for women suffering from osteomalacia.\n\nShe became a member of the Truth and Justice party which was formed in 2011.\n\nDr. Sima Samar has received numerous international awards for her work on human rights and democracy, including:\n\n\n\nOther Afghan Human Rights Activists\n"}

He is best known for his first novel, \"As For Me and My House\".\n\nRoss was born on a homestead near Shellbrook, Saskatchewan. When he was seven, his parents separated, and he lived with his mother on a number of different farms during his childhood, going to school in Indian Head, Saskatchewan. He left school after Grade 11 and in 1924 the sixteen-year-old Ross joined the Union Bank of Canada which became part of the Royal Bank of Canada a year later. At first he worked in a number of small towns in Saskatchewan then moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1933 and Montreal, Quebec in 1946, after spending four years in the Canadian Army during World War II. He would remain with the Royal Bank until his retirement in 1968, after which he spent some time in Spain and Greece before moving to a nursing home in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he lived until his death.\n\n\"As For Me and My House,\" set in an isolated town in the Prairies during the Great Depression, was published in 1941. At first not much noticed, it went on to become a Canadian literary classic which set the precedent for the genre of Canadian prairie fiction. He wrote three more novels during his lifetime as well as a few anthologies of short stories, none of which became as well known as his first novel. He is known to have destroyed manuscripts of novels that his publisher rejected, including a sequel to \"Sawbones Memorial\".\n\nA monument in his honour has been erected in Indian Head by Saskatchewan artists and readers with a bronze statue sculpted by Joe Fafard.\n\nIn 1992, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He died in 1996 after battling Parkinson's Disease, and was buried in Indian Head. At the end of his life, his homosexuality became public knowledge, thanks in large part to Keath Fraser's controversial 1997 biography \"As For Me and My Body: A Memoir of Sinclair Ross\".\n\n\n\n"}

A bittersweet and ironic reworking of the Baucis and Philemon legend, it is a simple story that represents the mature Gogol and hints at his later works.\n\nGogol opens by providing a romantic description of landowners in the countryside, giving particular attention to minute details. The two landowners, Afanasy Ivanovich Tovstogub and Pulkheriya Ivanovna Tovstogubikha live peacefully together in a remote village. The descriptions of them fit into the Slavophile tradition, comparing them strikingly against urban Little Russians (Ukrainians), particularly in Saint Petersburg, who are referred to as \"paltry contemptible creatures\" (because they acquire wealth dishonorably and conceal their descent by changing their last names to sound like Great Russians).\n\nThe two old landowners live in peace, with a mutual love that brings a sense of sympathy. The bulk of the opening focuses on their day-to-day lives, eating jelly, making jokes and so forth. Eventually, Gogol introduces Pulkheriya’s grey cat, which Afanasy jokes about, wondering why anyone would waste time with such a creature. The cat is introduced with a sense of foreboding, with Gogol commenting that little things can affect the stability of the strongest realities (\"a melancholy incident that transformed forever the life of that peaceful nook\").\n\nThe cat gets away at one point, and Pulkheriya finds it shortly thereafter in a feral state. Though it comes back to her and goes inside the house to be fed, the cat seems strangely different and eventually flees the house to never return. Pulkheriya then sinks into thought, believing that death will soon come for her. She grows ill and weary and dies, leaving Afanasy alone. He progressively breaks down, disturbed by the smallest things for they remind him of Pulkheriya. The entire area he had control over slowly becomes more degraded as his condition worsens, and he himself dies after he believes he hears her calling to him outside.\n\nA distant kinsman from an unknown location, who was a lieutenant, takes over control of the estate, and soon everything falls into ruin. He puts the estate under the care of a board of trustees, bringing things like a fine English sickle to clear the area, and the huts on the property soon fall down, leaving some peasants drunken and hopeless and others to run away to find better lives. The new owner rarely visits the estate, and the story ends commenting on his visits to local markets to buy nothing over a ruble in price.\n"}

Mikuriya\n\nTod Hiro Mikuriya (20 September 193320 May 2007) was a psychiatrist, and author of books such as Marijuana Medical Papers: 1839 - 1972. He is known as an outspoken advocate for the legalization and use of cannabis for medical purposes. He is regarded by some as the grandfather of the medical cannabis movement in the United States, most especially California.\n\nBorn in Pennsylvania, he was the director of non-classified marijuana research for the National Institute of Mental Health Center for Narcotics and Drug Abuse Studies in 1967. His 1972 self-published book \"Marijuana Medical Papers 1839-1972\" became a landmark in the modern movement for the legalization of Medical marijuana. Collected from the reference section at the National Library of Medicine it was saved from complete oblivion. Much to the irritation of cannabis prohibitionists, this medical intelligence has been restored for possible alternative medical applications.\n\nUntil his death in May 2007, he continued in private psychiatric practice limited to cannabis clinical consultation. He approved marijuana for medical purposes in over nine thousand patients, not solely in terminal cases, but also alleviation of physical and emotional pain in non-terminal cases. The legal situation is extremely complex (see legal history of marijuana in the United States). His practices are controversial and have drawn him into conflict with authorities. He was on five years probation with the Medical Board of California resulting from prosecutorial manipulation and conspiracy with local, state, and federal law enforcement vendetta starting in 2000. No patients were harmed. There were no complaints from patients, families or community physicians. Only law enforcement in eleven rural northern California counties responded to solicitation by Medical Board investigators and officials in the California Attorney General's office.\n\nIn a 1998 interview, Mikuriya (whose father was a Japanese Civil Engineer and a converted Christian and whose mother was born in Germany and was a practicing Bahá'í), made a connection between his family background and his views.\n\nGrowing up in the Quaker community of Fallsington, Pennsylvania and attending Quaker schools (George School, Haverford College) it was the compromise chosen by his parents that the three Mikuriya children were raised as Quakers. \"The Quakers were proprietors of the Underground Railway, I’m proud to say. The cannabis prohibition has the same dynamics as the bigotry and racism my family and I experienced starting on 7 December 1941, when we were transformed from normal-but-different people into war-criminal surrogates.\"\n\nMikuriya wrote the lyrics for several songs used in the campaign for the 1996 Medical Marijuana Initiative in California known as Proposition 215.\n\nHe ran in the 1980 United States House of Representatives elections, as a member of the Libertarian Party, against incumbent [(Ron Dellums)], a Democrat, and Republican Charles V. Hughes for California's 8th congressional district seat. He lost, with 10,465 votes, to Dellums' 108,380 and Hughes' 76,580.\n\nIn 1999, Mikuriya founded the California Cannabis Research Medical Group to help physicians share and exchange data about cannabis use by their patients. In 2004, the CCRMG formed The Society of Cannabis Clinicians (SCC) to facilitate voluntary medical standards for physician-approved cannabis under California law (HSC §11362.5).\n\nMikuriya died at his home in Berkeley, California on 20 May 2007, aged 73, after a long battle with cancer.\n\n\n"}

He was found to have acted of his own accord, while Hayes asserted managers were aware of his actions, and even condoned them.\n\nThomas Alexander William Hayes was born in West London to Nicholas and Sandra Hayes, and initially grew up in Hammersmith. He moved with his mother to Winchester after his parents divorced, where he was raised by his mother, and Timothy, his stepfather. He attended The Westgate School, and, later, Peter Symonds College. A fellow student described him as an \"incredibly smart geek\".\n\nAfter Peter Symonds, he attended the University of Nottingham, working in a restaurant kitchen during the summer holidays. He graduated with a degree in mathematics and engineering.\n\nIn 2001, after time as an intern at UBS, he joined Royal Bank of Scotland's trainee programme, at the interest rate derivatives desk. After working for Royal Bank of Scotland as a junior trader, he was headhunted by Royal Bank of Canada in 2004, and, upon moving there, he assumed greater responsibility. After two years at RBC, he moved to UBS in late 2006. Hayes was placed in the Tokyo office of UBS, where he began making trades involving the discrepancies between the Libor rate and Japanese interest rates. \n\nHayes turned down an offer from Goldman Sachs in 2008, but in 2009, accepted an offer from Citigroup; the bank gave him a $3 million signing bonus. \n\nHayes graduated with an MBA from Hult International Business School studying at the London campus.\n\nHayes traded derivatives at UBS and, later, Citigroup, in Tokyo. His favoured activity was basis trading, speculation on the movements in Libor expressed in multiple currencies and various durations, trades he might hedge with trades in other derivatives. The daily reporting of Libor rates by bankers around the world determined his success or failure in generating profits for his bank and bonuses for himself. By September 2008, a one basis point (1/100 of one per cent) move in Libor had about a US$750,000 effect on his bottom line. Through a network of his broker contacts, including one at the world's largest inter-dealer broker, ICAP, he succeeded in having Libor reported lower than its true level in order to drive his profits and personal bonuses higher.\n\nIn 2010, Hayes was fired by Citi for his Libor activities. After being fired, he moved back to England, where he day traded with his Citi bonus.\n\nOn December 11th, 2012, Hayes was arrested by British authorities for his involvement in manipulating Libor rates, and on December 19th, he was charged by the United States for the same crime. In order to avoid extradition to and subsequent trial by and imprisonment in the U.S., Hayes initially cooperated with the Serious Fraud Office, providing eighty hours of interviews so as to be charged by the United Kingdom. After being charged, Hayes withdrew his offer of cooperation, intending instead to fight the charges levied by the SFO. In response, the SFO narrowed the scope of their charges, so leaving less overlap between charges by American and British prosecutors, creating the possibility of a second trial in the United States.\n\nHayes was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome before his trial and was accompanied by a court-appointed aide during the trial. Throughout the trial, prosecutors used Hayes' SFO interviews to establish his greed and corruption. The defence attempted to illustrate that manipulation of Libor was both widespread and expected as part of Hayes' job description, with senior management as high up as the CEO aware of the tactic, though this was not accepted by the courts as a defence.\n\nIn August 2015, Hayes was sentenced to fourteen years in prison, to serve a minimum half of this sentence before being considered for early release. The judge, Jeremy Cooke, indicated he wished to \"send a signal\" to traders involved in illegal trading, as the sentence was significantly harsher than those given to other individuals convicted of financial crimes, such as Nick Leeson. Hayes maintained his innocence through the trial process. notwithstanding having stated during SFO interviews, \n\n“Well look, I mean, it’s a dishonest scheme, isn’t it? And I was part of the dishonest scheme, so obviously I was being dishonest.”\n\nAppeals by Hayes against conviction failed but his sentence was reduced by judges, including Sir Brian Leveson, Elizabeth Gloster and John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd to eleven years, under the same parole conditions.\n\nHaving exhausted all avenues of appeal, in May 2016, Hayes instructed solicitor Karen Todner to make an application for review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC).\n\nHayes has released letters concerning his time in prison. In them, he described being held separate from other prisoners, for his protection, in a \"segregation unit\".\n\nHayes is married to Sarah Tighe, a corporate lawyer in London. They have one child, Joshua. He received several nicknames from his colleagues, including Rain Man and \"Tommy Chocolate,\" in reference to his preference for hot chocolate over alcohol.\n\n"}

Prior to his entry onto the stage of Ukrainian politics, he was a long-time political activist, who lived abroad in Western Europe from 1906-1914. His works reflect his immersion in the Ukrainian revolutionary milieu, among impoverished and working-class people, and among emigres from the Russian Empire living in Western Europe.\n\nVynnychenko was born in a village Vesely Kut (today – Hryhorivka, Novoukrainka Raion), the Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire in a family of peasants. His father Kyrylo Vasyliovych Vynnychenko earlier in his life was a peasant-serf has moved from a village to the city of Yelisavetgrad where he married a widow Yevdokia Pavlenko (nee: Linnyk). From her previous marriage Yevdokia had three children: Andriy, Maria, and Vasyl, while from the marriage with Kyrylo only one son Volodymyr. Upon graduating from a local public school the Vynnychenko family managed to enroll Volodymyr to the (today is the building of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine). In later grades of the gymnasium he took part in a revolutionary organization and wrote a revolutionary poem for which was incarcerated for a week and excluded from school. That did not stop him to continue his studying as he was getting prepared for his test to obtain the high school diploma (Matura). He successfully took the test in the Zlatopil gymnasium from which obtained his \"attestation of maturity\".\n\nIn 1900 Vynnychenko joined the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party (RUP) and enrolled in the law department at Kiev University, but in 1902 or 1903 he was expelled for participation in revolutionary activities. As a member of RUP he provided political agitation and propaganda among the Kievan workers and peasants from Poltava and jailed for several months in Lukyanivska Prison. He managed to escape out of his incarceration. In 1902 Vynnychenko published in \"Kievskaya starina\" his first novel \"Beauty and strength\" after which he became known as a writer. Afterward, due to a new arrest he was forcibly drafted into punitive battalion the Russian Imperial army where he began to agitate soldiers with revolutionary propaganda. Tipped off that his arrest was imminent, Vynnychenko illegally fled to the eastern Galicia, Austria-Hungary. When trying to return to Ukraine with revolutionary literature, Vynnychenko was arrested and jailed in Kiev for two years with a threat to spend the rest of his life in katorga. After his release in 1905, he passed his exams for a law degree in Kiev University.\n\nIn 1906 Vynnychenko was arrested for a third time, again for his political activities, and jailed for a year; before his scheduled trial, however, the wealthy patron of Ukrainian literature and culture, Yevhen Chykalenko, paid his bail, and Vynnychenko fled Ukraine again, effectively become an emigre writer abroad from 1907 to 1914, living in Lemberg (Lviv), Vienna, Geneva, Paris, Florence, Berlin. In 1911 Vynnychenko married Rosalia Lifshitz, a French Jewish doctor. From 1914 to 1917 Vynnychenko lived illegally near Moscow throughout much of World War I and returned to Kiev in 1917 to assume a leading role in Ukrainian politics.\n\nAfter the Russian revolution in February 1917, Vynnychenko served as the head of the General Secretariat, a representative executive body of the Russian Provisional Government in Ukraine. He was authorized by the Central Rada of Ukraine (a \"de facto\" parliament) to conduct negotiations with the Russian Provisional Government, 1917.\n\nVynnychenko resigned his post in the General Secretariat on August 13 in protest for the government of Russia declining the Universal of Central Rada. For a brief period he was replaced by Dmytro Doroshenko who composed a new government the next day, yet unexpectedly he requested his resignation as well on August 18. Vynnychenko was offered to return, form a cabinet and redesign the Second Universal to petition a federal union with the Russian Republic. His second government was confirmed by Alexander Kerensky on September 1.\n\nIt is often claimed that political mistakes of Vynnychenko and Mykhailo Hrushevsky cost the newly established Ukrainian People's Republic its independence. Both men were strongly opposed to the creation of the army of the Republic and repeatedly denied the requests by Symon Petliura to use his volunteer forces as the core of a would-be army (see Polubotok Regiment Affair).\n\nAfter the October Revolution and the Kiev Bolshevik Uprising many of his secretaries resigned after the Central Rada disapproved the Bolsheviks actions in Petrograd with the ongoing confrontations in Moscow as well as the other cities in the country. On January 22, 1918, the Ukrainian People's Republic has proclaimed its independents due to the Bolshevik intervention headed by Antonov-Ovseyenko. The country was squeezed between the abandoned German-Russian front-lines to its western border and the advancing Bolshevik forces of Muravyov along the eastern border. Within days, Mikhail Muravyov manage to invade Kiev forcing the government to evacuate to Zhytomyr whose retreat was secured by the great efforts of the Yevhen Konovalets Sich Riflemen. During the evacuation the Ukrainian government managed to secure military assistance in the face of the Central Powers. The government of the Ukrainian People's Republic signed a highly criticized treaty with Germans to repel the Bolshevik forces in exchange for a right to expropriate food supplies. That treaty also required for the Russian SFSR to recognize the Ukrainian People's Republic. Around that time the Vynnychenko's government established an economic agreement with the government of Belarus People's Republic through the Belarus Chamber of Commerce in Kiev. Alas, Vynnychenko's was replaced as well by the Socialist-Revolutionary government of Vsevolod Holubovych.\n\nAfter the coup d'etat of Hetman Skoropadsky (in collaboration with the German occupation forces) in April 1918, Vynnychenko left Kiev. Later after forming the Directorate of Ukraine he took an active part in organizing a revolt against the Hetman. The revolt was successful and Vynnychenko returned to the capital on December 19, 1918. The Directorate, a temporary executive council of five, proclaimed the restoration of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Directorate was put in charge by the Labor Congress until the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly would convene to elect a permanent body of government.\n\nVynnychenko, unable to restore order and overcome the disagreement with Petliura, stepped down on February 10, 1919 and emigrated abroad. In a brief period while in Vienna, in 1920 he wrote his three volume work \"Rebirth of the Nation\". At the same time at the end of 1919, Vynnychenko resigned from the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party and formed the Foreign Group of Ukrainian Communists.\n\nHe formed the Foreign Group of the Ukrainian Communist Party, which was mainly made up of other former members of the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party, in order to promulgate this position. In June 1920 Vynnychenko himself travelled to Moscow in an attempt to come to an agreement with the Bolsheviks. After four months of unsuccessful negotiation, Vynnychenko had become disillusioned with the Bolsheviks: he accused them of Great Russian Chauvinism and insincerity as socialists. In September 1920 he returned to the emigration, where he revealed his impressions of Bolshevik rule. This split the Foreign Group of the Ukrainian Communist Party: some remained pro-Bolshevik and indeed returned to Soviet Ukraine; others supported Vynnychenko, and with him conducted a campaign against the Soviet regime in their organ \"Nova doba\" (\"New Era\").\n\nVynnychenko spent the following thirty years in Europe, residing in Germany in the 1920s, then moving to France. As an émigré, Vynnychenko resumed his career as a writer; in 1919 his writing was republished in an eleven volume edition in the 1920s. In 1934 Vynnychenko moved from Paris to Mougins, near Cannes, on the Mediterranean coast, where he lived on a homestead type residence as a self-supporting farmer and continued to write, notably a philosophical exposition of his ideas about happiness, Concordism. Vynnychenko called his place \"Zakoutok\". He died in Mougins, near Cannes, France in 1951. Rosalia Lifshitz after her death passed the estate to Ivanna Vynnykiv-Nyzhnyk (1912–1993), who emigrated to France after World War II and lived with Vynnychenko since 1948.\n\nVynnychenko is still somewhat famous in Ukraine. In today's Ukraine Vynnychenko has not been as much lionized as Mykhailo Hrushevsky as Vynnychenko was seen as being too much left wing to make a good symbolic figure.\n\nVynnychenko's archives are housed in the Columbia University, New York and supervised by a commission of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
