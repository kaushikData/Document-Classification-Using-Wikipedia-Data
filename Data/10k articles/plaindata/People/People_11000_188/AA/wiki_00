{"id": "1009476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1009476", "title": "Abby and Brittany Hensel", "text": "Abby and Brittany Hensel\n\nAbigail Loraine Hensel and Brittany Lee Hensel (born March 7, 1990) are American dicephalic parapagus twins; also known as conjoined twins. \n\nThey are highly symmetric for conjoined twins, giving the appearance of having a single body without marked variation from normal proportions. Each has a separate heart, stomach, spine, pair of lungs, and spinal cord.\n\nEach twin controls one arm and one leg. As infants, learning to crawl, walk and clap required them to cooperate. \n\nThey can eat and write separately and simultaneously. Activities such as running, swimming, hair brushing and driving a car require coordinated action.\n\nThe twins' progress has been covered in the popular media, including \"Life\" magazine and on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". They were interviewed on The Learning Channel in December 2006, discussing their daily lives and future plans. They starred in their own reality series, \"Abby & Brittany\", on TLC in 2012.\n\nThe twins were born in Carver County, Minnesota, to Patty, a registered nurse, and Mike Hensel, a carpenter and landscaper. They have a younger brother and sister. They were raised in New Germany, Minnesota, attended Mayer Lutheran High School in Mayer, and graduated from Bethel University in St. Paul in 2012.\n\nThe twins have a single body with separate heads and necks, a chest that is wider than normal, two arms, and two legs. At birth, they had a rudimentary arm between the bases of their necks attached to a shoulder blade at the back, being combined parts of Abby's left arm and Brittany's right arm. It was removed, leaving the shoulder blade.\n\nAbby's head tilts laterally outward about 5 degrees to the right, while Brittany's tilts laterally at about 15 degrees to the left, causing her to appear shorter even when seated. Brittany's leg is in fact nearly two inches shorter than Abby's and Brittany tends to stand and walk on tip-toe which has made her calf muscle significantly larger than Abby's. The continued growth of Abby's spine was surgically halted after Brittany prematurely stopped growing. At age 12, they underwent surgery at Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare to correct scoliosis and to expand their chest cavity to prevent future difficulties with breathing.\n\nEach twin manages one side of their conjoined body. The sense of touch of each is restricted to her body half; this shades off at the midsagittal plane such that there is a small amount of overlap at the midline. Stomach aches, however, are felt by only the twin on the opposite side. \n\nThey are effective in cooperatively using their limbs when both hands or both legs are required. By coordinating their efforts, they are able to walk, run, swim, and ride a bicycle normally—all tasks that they learned at a normal speed. Together, they can type on a computer keyboard at a normal speed and drive a car. However, their disparate heights (Abby, , is taller and longer of leg than Brittany, ) led to difficulty in balancing a Segway, as shown in their 2012 reality series.\n\nThe twins have individual organs in the upper part of their body, while most located at or below the level of the navel are shared, the exception being the spinal cord.\n\n\nUpon their birth, the twins' parents decided not to attempt surgical separation after hearing from doctors that it was not likely that both would survive the operation. As they grew and learned to walk and develop other skills, their parents confirmed their decision against separation, arguing that the quality of life for the surviving twin or twins living separately would be less than their quality of life as conjoined people.\n\nThe twins both passed their driver's license exams, both the written and driving tests. They had to take the tests twice, once for each twin. Abby controls the devices on the right of the driver's seat; Brittany, those on the left. Together they control the steering wheel.\n\nThey both graduated from high school in 2008. They began college at Bethel University in Arden Hills, Minnesota, majoring in education. They had considered pursuing different concentrations within that major, but the volume of extra coursework was prohibitive. They graduated with Bachelor of Arts degrees in 2012.\n\nIn conversation, the twins are clearly distinct persons, with distinct likes and dislikes. Their preferences in food, clothing color, etc., differ. Some of their clothes are altered by their seamstress so that they have two separate necklines in order to emphasize their individuality. They usually have separate meals, but sometimes share a single meal for the sake of convenience (e.g., each taking a bite of the same hamburger). Abby is better at mathematics, and Brittany at writing. \n\nFor tasks such as responding to email, they type and respond as one, anticipating each other's feelings with little verbal communication between them. In such cases as the latter, their choice of grammatical person is to use \"I\" when they agree, but use their names when their responses do differ.\n\nThere is some concern about the twins' continued good health, because only four known sets of conjoined twins who share an undivided torso and two legs have ever survived into adulthood, and most have congenital heart defects or other organ anomalies. None has shown up in their case. \n\nThey intensely dislike being stared at or photographed by strangers while going about their private lives. In interviews for the Discovery Channel in 2006, they, then 16, said that they hoped to date, get married, and have children. They also stated that they hoped that by providing some information about themselves, they would be able to lead otherwise fairly typical social lives.\n\nThe twins appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on April 8 and April 29, 1996. During the same month, they were featured on the cover of \"Life\" under the caption \"One Body, Two Souls\", and their daily lifestyle was described in the article, \"The Hensels' Summer\". \"Life\" followed up with another story in September 1998. In 2002, they appeared in \"Joined for Life\", a TV documentary by Advanced Medical Productions, distributed on the Discovery Health Channel and a 2003 follow-up, \"Joined at Birth\". \n\nIn 2003, an updated story of them at age 11 (filmed in 2001) was published in \"Time\" and again in \"Life\". ABC TV also did a documentary called \"Joined For Life\". \n\nA UK television special in 2005 as part of the series \"Extraordinary People\". In 2006, Advanced Medical made another documentary, \"Joined for Life: Abby & Brittany turn 16\", that discusses their adolescence, school, social life, and activities such as getting their driver's licenses. \n\nThe twins starred in the reality TV show \"Abby & Brittany\" that started in August 2012. \"Abby and Brittany: Joined for Life\" was shown by the BBC in the UK in May 2013, and covers the period from their finishing college to starting a part-time teaching job.\n\nDocumentaries and other television appearances include:\n\n"}

His solo career includes the albums \"Non-Stop\", \"Electric Blue\", and \"iPop\".\n\nBell grew up in the Dogsthorpe area of Peterborough. His family still resides in the city and surrounding areas such as Market Deeping. Bell was educated at the King's School in the city.\n\nIn 1985, while selling women's shoes and performing in a band called the Void, he responded to a newspaper advert that was looking for a singer. Vince Clarke had been Bell's \"hero\"; Bell was successful in his audition and together they formed the group Erasure. The pair have sold over 25 million albums worldwide.\n\nBell has also donated time and made recordings for charities. These included Ferry Aid's cover of \"Let It Be\" (1987); a cover of Cole Porter's \"Too Darn Hot\", that was included in 1990s \"Red Hot + Blue\" album to raise funds for AIDS and HIV research; re-making Lene Lovich's \"Rage\" alongside her to be included in \"PETA\"'s album (1991) in favour of a wildlife campaign; and performing twice on Big Spender's Red Hot and Dance events to support various AIDS projects (in both December 1994 and November 2004). Bell also performed on the True Colours Tour 2008.\n\nBell sang the role of Montresor in the opera \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Peter Hammill and Judge Smith, released in 1991 and reissued with a new recording in 1999.\n\nBell's first solo album was announced in July 2005. He signed a worldwide solo recording contract with Sanctuary Records, and announced details of his debut album, which was released on 3 October 2005 and entitled \"Electric Blue\". The album featured fourteen tracks, including three duets, with Claudia Brücken of Propaganda and Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters.\n\nThe first single, \"Crazy\", released on 26 September 2005, included club remixes from his Erasure partner Vince Clarke, plus Cicada, MHC and King Roc. \"Electric Blue\" was co-written and recorded throughout 2004 and 2005 with Manhattan Clique (Philip Larsen and Chris Smith) who have worked with Erasure, Moby, the B-52s, Stereophonics and Goldfrapp.\n\nBell released his second solo album, \"Non-Stop\", on 7 June 2010. It was co-written and co-produced by Bell and Pascal Gabriel, who previously remixed \"It Doesn't Have to Be\" for Erasure. It also features a collaboration with Perry Farrell.\n\nUsing the pseudonym Mimó, Bell released two Pascal Gabriel-produced singles on Mute Records: \"Running Out\" (2009) and \"Will You Be There?\" (2010) prior to his second solo album. The name, used as a \"tribute to good friend Tomeau Mimó”, was not used on any subsequent solo releases, as a legal block was issued against Bell by another artist already using the Mimó name. Both songs appear on \"Non-Stop\" and have since been re-branded as Andy Bell.\n\nIn June 2011, he appeared on the second season of ITV series \"Popstar to Operastar\" and finished in fifth place.\n\nBell is openly gay, and had a longtime partner in Paul M. Hickey. Bell told \"Melody Maker\" in 1986, \"I don't want to go out of my way to talk about it but I'm not going to pretend I'm not [gay]. I won't portray a heterosexual in videos and we're consciously doing lyrics that could apply to either sex\". He told Barry Walters of \"Seventeen\", \"I want to be known as a good performer but it's important to me to take a stance. If you're doing music, you should use it for something and have substance. Being gay and open about it is my substance\".\n\nOn 17 December 2004, Bell publicly announced that he has been HIV-positive since 1998. In a 2007 interview, he remarked that there is a complacency among gay men about HIV:\nBell suffers from avascular necrosis. He has had both hips replaced, which keeps him from \"pogoing around\" in more recent performances.\n\nHis partner, Paul Hickey, died on 11 April 2012 at the age of 62. In January 2013, Bell married partner Stephen Moss.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After her father died, she was educated at schools in Britain and Germany. She lived for a time at the home of George MacDonald and later at the home of William Morris. In 1882 she married the out-of-work barrister T. J. Sanderson, and they both took the surname Cobden-Sanderson.\n\nAnne was concerned that her husband was thinking rather than doing, and she suggested that he take up book-binding. They were already in the social circle of William Morris and Jane Burdon, and it was her husband who first coined the term \"Arts and Crafts\". Morris had already established the Kelmscott Press when Anne's husband and a photographer named Emery Walker agreed to found a press. The press was named the Doves Press and the profits were to be shared, but it was Anne who put up the capital of £1600 to start the business. Crucially, it was agreed that should the partnership end, Walker would be entitled to a copy of the font that they proposed to create. The Doves Type was created and Anne's single-minded husband used strict \"Arts and Crafts\" principles to create the Doves Bible, which was sold at a £500 profit. By 1906 the partners had fallen out over Walker's lack of interest and her husband's obsessive interest. Despite the agreement, Anne's husband did not deliver a copy of the font and instead arranged for every copy of the design to be dropped into the River Thames.\nCobden-Sanderson worked for the Independent Labour Party and was arrested as a suffragette in October 1906 (along with Minnie Baldock and Nellie Martel). George Bernard Shaw wrote a letter of protest in September and she was released the following month. She was a founding member of the Women's Freedom League. She also helped form the Women's Tax Resistance League in 1909.\n\nIn 1907 she was invited to speak in the United States by Harriet Stanton Blatch to tell American suffragettes about the protest methods used in Britain. She addressed the first meeting of the Bryn Mawr College Suffrage Society using the title \"Why I went to Prison\". She went to America with her husband and, while she spoke to women's rights groups, he was welcomed as an \"Arts and Crafts\" celebrity.\n\nIn 1922 her husband died. After his death, Cobden-Sanderson paid a large sum to settle a dispute with Emery Walker. This money was to compensate him for the loss of the typeface that her husband had thrown into the Thames when his partnership with Walker ended.\n\nCobden-Sanderson died in Hammersmith in 1926.\n"}

He is best known as the drummer of the rock bands Rage Against the Machine (1991–2000; 2007–2011), Audioslave (2001–2007; 2017), and Prophets of Rage (2016–present).\n\nWilk started his career as a drummer for Greta in 1990, and helped co-found Rage with Tom Morello and Zack de la Rocha in August 1991. Following that band's breakup in October 2000 Wilk, Morello, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford, and Soundgarden front man Chris Cornell formed the supergroup Audioslave, which broke up in 2007. As of 2016, he is playing in the band Prophets of Rage, with Commerford, Morello, Chuck D, B-Real and DJ Lord.\n\nWilk has also performed drums on English metal band Black Sabbath's final album \"13\". The album was released in June 2013. Wilk briefly played with Pearl Jam shortly after the release of their debut album \"Ten\".\n\nBradley J. Wilk was born on September 5, 1968, in Portland, Oregon and raised in Chicago, Illinois. His family later settled in Southern California. He started to play the drums when he was thirteen years old. He has cited John Bonham, Keith Moon, and Elvin Jones as his greatest influences. Wilk was a fan of Van Halen in his youth, having seen the band live when he was thirteen. He is of Jewish-Polish descent.\n\nWilk's success as the drummer of Rage Against the Machine came from the failure of a different band; he once auditioned for a band called Lock Up, who released one album (titled \"Something Bitchin' This Way Comes\") through Geffen records in 1989 and broke up when the album received little media attention upon release. Former Lock Up guitarist Tom Morello was looking to pick up where Lock Up left off and start a new band, and contacted Wilk, who was playing with the band Greta, to see if he was interested in playing the drums. A short while after, the duo met Zack de la Rocha while he was rapping freestyle in a club, and through him, bassist Tim Commerford (a childhood friend of de la Rocha). The band played two shows in 1991, and spent 1992 frequenting the L. A. club circuit, during which they signed a record deal with Epic Records, and released their self-titled debut album that November. They quickly achieved commercial success and would go on to release three more studio albums–\"Evil Empire\" in 1996, \"The Battle of Los Angeles\" in 1999, and \"Renegades\" in 2000– before disbanding in October 2000.\n\nRage Against The Machine reunited to play at the Coachella Music Festival in Coachella, California on January 22, 2007. On April 29, 2007, Rage Against The Machine reunited at the Coachella Music Festival (see Rage Against the Machine reunion tour). The band played in front of an EZLN backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. Initially thought to be a one-time event, the band played seven more shows that year in the United States (including their first non-festival concert in seven years at the Alpine Valley Music Theater in East Troy, Wisconsin), and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside of the U.S. as part of the Big Day Out Festival in Australia and New Zealand. The band has since continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including Lollapalooza in Chicago. After a brief South America tour in 2010, they created their own festival, the L. A. Rising, which they headlined on July 30, 2011. This is their most recent show to date. In November 2012, they released an XX anniversary boxset of their first album.\n\nThe remaining members formed Audioslave with former Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. The band released their self-titled debut album in 2002, which was followed by \"Out of Exile\" in 2005, and \"Revelations\" in 2006. Audioslave formally disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell left to focus on his solo career.\n\nIn 2016, Brad Wilk reunited with Tom Morello and Tim Commerford, and was joined by Chuck D, B-Real and DJ Lord to form supergroup Prophets of Rage. They play covers from their Rage Against The Machine, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill material, and new material as well. They're touring the United States under the statement \"Make America Rage Again\" to protest against Donald Trump policies and the 2016 American presidential election.\n\nWilk and bandmate Tom Morello joined with Maynard James Keenan of Tool and Billy Gould of Faith No More–in a lineup that was billed as Shandi's Addiction–to record the song \"Calling Dr. Love\" for the 1994 Kiss tribute album . Wilk and bandmate Tim Commerford contributed in Keenan's side project Puscifer and his album \"\"V\" Is for Vagina\" on the track \"Momma Sed\". Wilk also contributed drums to rap group Cypress Hill's album \"Skull and Bones\". In addition, Wilk composed the song \"Snoop Bounce (Roc N Roll Remix)\" for Snoop Dogg's \"\" CD.\n\nIn 2005, Wilk played the lead role in the independent short movie Sleeping Dogs Lie by writer Chumahan Bowen and director Stuart Lessner. The film also features Tool lead singer Maynard James Keenan as Deputy Lance. Wilk played drums on Josh Homme's tracks on the soundtrack to Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys. Wilk performed live with Tom Morello's side project, Street Sweeper Social Club, at the 2010 Coachella music and arts festival. In 2013, Wilk and Commerford contributed drums and bass, respectively, for Dave Grohl's \"Sound City\" soundtrack, on the song \"Time Slowing Down\". Wilk played several shows with the Sound City Players.\n\nHaving established himself as a session musician, Wilk has also contributed drums on the Black Sabbath album \"13\", which was released on June 11, 2013. In late 2013, Wilk joined the band The Last Internationale and recently recorded their debut album called \"We Will Reign\" with producer Brendan O'Brien. The record was released on August 19, 2014.\n\nTo the end of 2014 until June 2015, Brad Wilk was playing drums on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins along with Billy Corgan, Jeff Schroeder and also Mark Stoermer on bass. On 26 February 2015, while touring Australia with the band, he joined the Foo Fighters on stage at Sydney's Olympic (ANZ) stadium playing drums for a Van Halen cover Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love. On August 3, 2015, Wilk sat-in with The 8G Band on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\". He's also been drumming for Juliette Lewis on various tours and shows.\n\nWilk has noted a personal affinity with the number three throughout his life, and has positioned small decal stickers of the number \"3\" all over his drum kit, and as well as in the liner notes for Rage Against the Machine's third album, \"The Battle of Los Angeles\". In an interview with Modern Drummer Wilk said \"Ever since I was eight or nine I've gravitated to the number three. It's something that has always been a really heavy number for me. It's tattooed on my arm, and I count in threes. Everyone in school was taught two, four, six, eight, ten- I'd count in threes in the way I'd walk, even in the decisions I'd make. It was all based on threes\", and also incorporates 3 into his playing.\n\nWilk was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1997, and is active in raising money for diabetes awareness. He has donated about $12,000 to the Orange County chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).\n\nUnable to find an all natural, sugar-free lemonade that would fit with his diet management and exercise plan, Wilk began formulating his own lemonade in his kitchen, using stevia in the place of sugar. After receiving positive feedback from friends and family, Wilk launched \"Olade\". Since December 2009, the Food and Drug Administration has approved Olade to be put into the market as a non-dietary supplement, meaning anyone with or without diabetes can consume it.\n\nRage Against the Machine studio albums\n\nAudioslave studio albums\n\nBlack Sabbath studio albums\n\nThe Last Internationale studio albums\n\nProphets of Rage studio albums\n"}

A number of these merchant vessels were sunk by German U-boats during the first and second world wars. The company's aim is to locate these sunken vessels and retrieve their cargoes.\n\nThe company claims to have spent 25 years researching lost war-time vessels. Via this research on war-risk insurance payouts and cross-referencing the vessels with insurance records they have identified some 700 vessels that contain bullion. The bullion was being transported to The United States and members of the British Commonwealth to pay for war materials.\n\nThe company estimates that some 2000 tons of precious metals (mainly gold and silver bullion) was sunk from ships that mainly left from Glasgow and Liverpool.\n\nThe company has not revealed details of which port they are based for security reasons. The first exploration they intend to survey is a group of two first world war and a single second world war British merchant ships sunk by a German U-boat whilst en-route to Canada.\n\nThe company has built a special vessel that allows the crew to remain directly over the sunken vessels. From this ship the crew will lower submersibles (to depths of 5,500m) to investigate the ships and prepare for the next stage of retrieving the precious metals. The cost of the first expedition is estimated at £15 million.\n\nAs the bullion remains in the ownership of the British Government the company will need to negotiate how the retrieved bullion is brough back to the UK. Since 1914 all British warships sunk are classified as both war graves and sovereign territory, merchant vessel wrecks however do not have the same legal protection.\n\nBritannia's Gold Ltd is backed by private investment but it is also crowd-sourcing an initial £8 million to conduct the first surveys.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24594118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24594118", "title": "Charles Savage (beachcomber)", "text": "Charles Savage (beachcomber)\n\nCharlie Savage, (?– September 6, 1813) was a sailor (most likely of Swedish descent) and beachcomber known for his exploits on the islands of Fiji between 1808 and 1813.\n\nMost accounts place Savage as a sailor aboard a ship registered in Port Jackson (Sydney), Australia, from which he was left in Tonga around 1807. From Tonga he was taken to Fiji by the \"Eliza\" which was wrecked near Nairai Island.\n\nGiven his fluency of the Tongan and Fijian languages and proclivity for violence, Savage easily insinuated himself in the company of the Bau Island chieftain Naulivou. From the wreckage of the \"Eliza\", Savage was able to salvage a number of muskets which he then demonstrated to the Bauan leaders. This combination of circumstance, personality, and technology allowed Savage to participate in the Fijian wars, allegedly the first time firearms were ever used in Fiji.\n\nSavage led a small group of beachcombers as mercenaries in the service of Naulivou and quickly showed their worth in fights with his enemies. Lacking certain cultural inhibitions of Fijians (such as targeting opposing chieftains at the outset of battle) and leveraging their individual skill with muskets proved Savage and company as a violent and capable force in Fijian internecine warfare.\n\nSavage is credited with using an arrow-proof structure built outside his enemies' fortifications so that he could fire at them with impunity. Other accounts of his lethality depict that his “victims were so numerous that the townspeople piled up the bodies and sheltered behind them; and the stream beside the village ran red.”\n\nFor his services, Savage was accorded a certain amount of prestige and rewards from Naulivou, although the scope and magnitude of the more sensational details, to include numerous wives, influence on local politics, and becoming a cannibal chief in his own right, appear to be exaggerated accounts mixed with European yarns of “white savages.”\n\nIn 1813 the \"Hunter\" reached Fiji to ply in the sandalwood trade and subsequently employed a number of local European beachcombers including Savage. As recounted by third mate Peter Dillon, Savage met his fate in a skirmish with Wailea Fijians on September 6, 1813. Ashore as a member of a party to destroy Wailean canoes, Savage and the other scattered members of the party found themselves the victims of an ambush. They attempted to flee back to the anchored \"Hunter\", but found “it impossible to get to the boat through the crowds of natives that intercepted the pathway.” At this point Dillon directed the men to climb a flat-topped hill of a rock (which later became Dillon's Rock) and organized a defense. Because of its steep and narrow ascent, the rock could only be climbed by a few persons at a time, allowing the defenders to maximize their volleys.\nAfter some intense and sporadic exchanges, the Wailea fell back to a siege of sorts comprised (by Dillon’s accounting) of several thousand natives. At this point Savage suggested that they break and run, but this was outrightly dismissed by Dillon, who, to further accentuate his resolve, threatened to shoot the first man who attempted to run. Using the lull in fighting to attempt to parlay, Dillon reminded the Wailea that eight of their own, including a priest’s brother were held hostage on board the \"Hunter\". Dillon proposed sending a man down to go to the ship to secure their release in exchange for the defenders. The Wailea agreed and so an injured defender was sent down to facilitate the transaction. During this ceasefire, several chiefs climbed the hill to implore the remaining defenders to accept offers of friendship and peace. Savage, confident in his knowledge of the language and customs was convinced that he could go down safely and secure some sort of resolution. Dillon disagreed and refused to leave the rock before the prisoner exchange, and allowed Savage to go only if he left his musket and ammunition behind.\n\nSavage then descended the rock and spoke with the Wailea for some time who continued to try to convince Dillon to join them but to no avail. Finally, exasperated by Dillon’s refusal to come down and triggered by another defender attempting to escape, the Wailea attacked the unarmed Savage and quickly overpowered him, eventually drowning him in a well. Dillon goes on to describe cannibalistic practices and rituals involved with Savage’s and the others’ bodies, but those details have been disputed by others.\n\nThe life of an archetypal beachcomber with few documented exploits has served as the legend-making clay of numerous writers and historians in the time since. Savage's influence (and by association muskets) on Fiji's history has been debated. Scholarly books and articles have examined Savage's legacy in terms of his aid in the rise of the Bau (and thus their subsequent dominance of Fiji), his introduction of firearms, and his role as an agent of social change with varying degrees of support and reproof.\n\n"}

He occupied a number of significant military and political posts in the Kuomintang and in Sun Yat-Sen's government from the late 1910s through the 1940s. By the late 1940s he was one of the most powerful members of the Kuomintang, and in 1948, he was a successful candidate for the vice-presidency of the KMT Nationalist government. He was also Governor of Hunan, his native province and in whose political affairs he had been active all his life. In August 1949, he peacefully surrendered to the Communists, who were rapidly advancing on Guangzhou, then the seat of the KMT government, hastening the collapse of the defense of the KMT National Revolutionary Army. After 1949, Cheng held several important political positions in the People's Republic of China until his death in 1968.\n\nAfter having studied at a private school and having passed examination in 1889, Cheng joined the Yuelu Academy in Changsha. Here he began to understand the current political situation and decided to give up imperial exams and a civil career in favor of the military. In 1903, when he was 21, he was admitted first to the Hunan Military Academy, and was sent the following year to study in Japan at the Tokyo Shimbu Gakko, a military preparatory academy. While in Tokyo, he met Huang Xing, Li Liejun, and Song Jiaoren, future nationalist leaders, who fascinated him with their ideas. In 1905 Cheng joined Sun Yat-sen's \"Tongmenghui\" a secret revolutionary society, committed to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and modernize China. After serving as a cadet for one year in an artillery battalion in Himeji, he was admitted to the artillery school of the 6th class of the Imperial Japanese Army in 1907. One of his classmates was Tang Jiyao.\n\nAfter graduation in 1908, Cheng returned in China, where he was put in charge of training a New Army in Sichuan Province under Zhu Qinglan. After the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution, Cheng took part in the Wuchang Uprising and immediately after he participated in the Battle of Changsha.\n\nWith the establishment of the Republic of China, Cheng was appointed military commander of Hunan. However, as Yuan Shikai staged his coup to control the Republic, Cheng tried to revolt, but his failure prompted him to flee to Japan, where he joined the Kuomintang and entered the Waseda University.\n\nShortly after, Yuan Shikai tried to proclaim himself Emperor, causing the National Protection War. Cheng returned to Hunan to enlist rebel soldiers in Cai E's army. During the Constitutional Protection Movement he was first appointed military commander of Changsha, then Vice Minister of War in Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Government. He was put in charge of training troops in Guangzhou, and then took part in the Northern Expedition. From 1925 to 1927 he was the General commanding 6th Army, and briefly served as Chairman of the Government of the Hunan Province in 1928. In 1926 he was elected a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.\n\nIn the following years, Cheng served in several capacities, including chief of General Staff from 1935 to 1937. When the Second Sino-Japanese War began, Cheng Qian was made Commander in Chief of the 1st War Area in July 1937, and concurrently Chairman of the Government of Henan Province from 1937 to 1939. Cheng Qian was recalled from 1st War area in 1938 to serve as director of the Generalissimo's Headquarters from until 1940. From 1940 to 1944 he was Deputy Chief of Staff of the National Military Council, and from 1944 to 1945 he was acting Chief of Staff of the National Military Council. He was also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.\n\nAfter the war ended, Cheng sided with the conciliatory faction in the Kuomintang. In 1947 he was elected in the Legislative Yuan (in the first election after 14 years) and contested the vice-presidency of the Republic of China in March 1948, barely losing it to Li Zongren, supported by Chiang Kai-shek. Afterwards, he was appointed governor of Hunan once again.\n\nAs the Communist Party of China forces gained ground, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down in January 1949; after the collapse of peace talks in April, the communists crossed the Yangtze River. Cheng Qian in early August decided to surrender, and so Changsha was peacefully taken by the People's Liberation Army.\n\nAlthough the Kuomintang government issued an arrest warrant for Cheng, he was able to reach Beijing to attend the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The Central People's Government that ruled the People's Republic of China until 1954 appointed him vice-chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Council and vice-chairman of the Central-South Military and Government Administration Council, working to prevent river floods. He was also a vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang.\n\nIn the following years, he was elected non-communist governor of Hunan in 1952, and a vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress from 1954 till his death.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Cheng Qian was among the non-communists that Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai prevented from being attacked, but he lost his leadership position in Hunan after a revolutionary committee under Li Yuan's chairmanship was formed there. He died in Beijing on 15 April 1968 aged 86.\n"}

She was first introduced in November 1999, created by then-head writer Tom Langan. Bjorlin played Chloe nearly continuously from 1999 through 2005, and from 2007 until 2011, when she decided not to renew her contract with the soap. In 2012, Bjorlin announced during an interview with \"TV Guide\" that she would return to \"Days of our Lives\" once again, makingher return on January 7, 2013 and remaining through April 16, 2013. Bjorlin returned to the role, in a two-episode stint in celebration of the soap's fiftieth anniversary celebration on August 3, 2015. She returned for another visit in January 2016 and returned full-term in June 2016.\n\nChloe arrived in Salem in the year 1999, having lived in an orphanage for fifteen years. She reunited with her birth mother, Nancy Wesley and they faced issues in their mother-daughter relationship. Chloe's social life was also bad as she was bullied at school for her personality and appearance, leading to her being popularly called \"Ghoul girl\" by her peers. In spite of this, she managed to form a relationship with Philip Kiriakis. Chloe, who is also an opera singer, has diverted away from her early dark image over the years. She has been married three times, two of which have ended in divorce with one being annulled. She also shares a child with her late ex-husband Daniel Jonas, Parker.\n\nThe role of Chloe Lane was introduced by head writer Tom Langan in November 1999. She has been portrayed by Nadia Bjorlin since the beginning. The character was born on August 20, 1984. Her birth-date was originally 1985, as she appeared to be 16 years old in 2001. Bjorlin's contract on \"Days of our Lives\" lasted until June 13, 2003 and she departed the series. She briefly returned from December 24, 2003 to January 12, 2004. She had another stint from August 13 to September 2004. She returned on a recurring status from December 2004 to September 16, 2005, when she left \"Days of our Lives\" to pursue a role in the UPN series \"Sex, Love & Secrets\".\n\nShe returned on November 29, 2007 after an absence. Discussing her return, the actress said: \"I love working with the people I used to and [who] I know, but it's also fun to work with new people, because you don't know what they're going to do in a scene\". While absent, she had landed roles in primetime series, as well as working in films. She departed again in September 2011, and made her return on January 4, 2013, but departed the role a couple months later on April 16, 2013. The May 13, 2013, issue of \"Soaps In Depth\" confirmed that Bjorlin would make a brief return later in the year, airing September 24, 2013 and September 25, 2013.\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that Bjorlin would return as part of the show's fiftieth anniversary; she returned for a two-day stint on August 3 and August 4, 2015.\n\nIn September 2015, it was hinted in an interview with Patrika Darbo that Bjorlin would be returning to the show at an unknown date. Bjorlin made her brief return on January 8 till 28, 2016.\n\nIn December 2015, it was confirmed that Bjorlin will return as Chloe, but in a contract role, airing on June 10, 2016.\n\nChloe has been described by William Keck of \"USA Today\" as: \"soap's tragically disfigured soprano diva.\" Chloe's teenage years weren't bright, she was often a victim of bullying at school. She had a dark personality; wearing black clothes all the time and also wearing large glasses. She had a \"defensive\" attitude, which allowed her to be bullied by her peers and was referred to as \"Ghoul girl\", and was a social outcast. They even left live chickens at her doorstep. Her turning point came when Belle Black (Kirsten Storms) and Philip Kiriakis (Jay Kenneth Johnson) befriended her. At the school dance in June 2000, she wore a bright red dress and had changed her appearance, stunning everybody. A writer of \"The Spokesman-Review\" newspaper called her a \"stunning beauty\". Michael Logan of \"TV Guide\" noted twelve years later in 2012 that: \"She's had the craziest trajectory from Ghoul Girl.\" In recent times, however, Chloe has diverted far away from her early image and her storylines focus more on her relationships, especially her habit of cheating. In 2010, Bjorlin said: \"You know what? Chloe is not a naughty girl! She just makes bad decisions. She is always the one that gets stuck paying the ultimate consequences for her actions. She does not think things through realistically\".\n\nSoap opera journalist Michael Fairman noted that Chloe tends to befriend women who have done her wrong, such as Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) and Carly Manning (Crystal Chappell), to which Bjorlin responded: \"At least Carly was horrible within reason, but Nicole I don’t understand. It sort of adds to the fact that Chloe in her last few years, was being written like such a push-over and naïve. I am trying to see that she tries to see the best in all people and everyone makes mistakes.\" When asked in 2009 who she would like to see Chloe possibly paired with, Bjorlin said E.J. DiMera (James Scott), stating: \"I've had a lot of fun with the whole Chloe and Philip and Chloe and Brady thing, but you know I think it would be kind of fun to create some controversy and stir things up. Maybe a Chloe and EJ thing\".\n\nDespite her being hated at school, she developed a romance with Philip. After their first kiss, she was appalled to find out that he only invited her to the dance because he lost a bet. During this time, she found herself falling in love with Brady Black (Kyle Lowder), though still dating Philip. She suspected that Philip's father, Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) was using Brady to break up her romance with Philip; Philip also too suspected this and warned Brady to stay away from Chloe. After her relationship with Philip ended she eventually became involved with Brady. They married in 2005; however, shortly after their marriage was destroyed because of Brady's drug addiction. When she returned in 2007, many thought it might have been her fault. In 2008, they divorced. Of this storyline, Bjorlin said: \"I personally was kind of glad that they didn’t take it in the approach that Chloe had done something, that it was Chloe’s fault or that Chloe killed him or had been unfaithful or whatever it may have been. I’m sort of glad that in the best manner they could, they didn’t really taint the relationship in that sense and they left the characters with integrity.\" In 2003, Philip was re-cast with Kyle Brandt, who remained in the role in 2006. Upon Bjorlin's own return to the series in 2007, Johnson had returned to the role. Of this, Bjorlin stated that it was easy for her to fall right back into place as far as Philip and Chloe's relationship goes: \"It's sort of undeniable. Jay and I have always had a really great time working together. We sometimes can't keep it together and be serious, especially now that Philip is so serious. He's a man now, so angry and stern. We'll start cracking up and we can't stop laughing.\" She again said in 2009: \"I think there’s such a camaraderie and trust and respect between both of us that’s been built for years that we truly enjoy working with each other\".\n\nChloe began romancing Lucas Roberts (Bryan Dattilo) after the demise of his relationship with Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney). On New Year's Eve of 2008, they became engaged. She cheated on Lucas with Dr. Daniel Jonas (Shawn Christian) and soon went into a coma after being poisoned by Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow), Lucas' mother. Her relationship with Daniel was popular with viewers, labeled as \"Danloe\". She awakened and her brief marriage to Lucas ended. She became involved with Daniel, but ended up cheating on him too. Chloe—after being duped by Vivian Alamain into thinking Daniel and Carly were having an affair—had a one-night stand with Philip while they were drunk and she ended up pregnant. Of this, Bjorlin stated: \"She probably did not deal with her grief in the most appropriate way possible. Chloe does crazy things\". Carly, feeling guilty because Chloe's being duped into thinking her and Daniel were having an affair as a cruel attempt on VIvian's part to get Chloe to kill Carly, agreed to help Chloe secretly obtain a DNA test. Chloe came to form a friendship with Carly. Bjorlin said of their friendship: \"I was feeling slightly juvenile for awhile just spewing venom on her. It is nice that we formed this friendship.\"\n\nMichael Fairman of \"On-Air On-Soaps\" said during his interview with Bjorlin and Christian \"Dr. Daniel is becoming a dim-wit! Can’t he figure something is going on behind his back?\". Bjorlin said: \"It is kind of hysterical that everybody in Salem knows about this cheating incident except Daniel, at this point.\" Because the DNA test had supposedly been switched, Chloe believed herself that Daniel could very well be the baby's father. She said: \"[Chloe] got the relief of a lifetime when she found out the baby was Daniel’s. So she thought, “Now I am going to have my wedding. Nothing can go wrong.\" Chloe gave birth to a son, who she named Parker Jonas initially. However, the supposed truth came out at Parker's baptism in front of family and friends that Philip was Parker's father. This led to the end of the marriage. Having lost Daniel, Chloe sank into a state of post partum depression and tried to commit suicide. Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, she's attempting to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, since it turns out that Parker really is his son.\n\nAfter four years on June 7, 2011, TV Line among other sources confirmed that she was to depart once again. Her last air date was September 28, 2011. Bjorlin said of her decision not to renew her contract: \"It’s a bittersweet moment for me, but fortunately I have been at these crossroads before, and I’ve always rose to the challenge in everything I pursued I will miss the cast and crew dearly, and they — including executive producer Ken Corday — will always be considered family to me. At the same time, I am excited for where this next chapter in my life takes me\". While away, Bjorlin worked on the series with fellow \"Days\" co-star Crystal Chappell and also appeared on the reality television show \"Dirty Soap\", a series which followed the real lives of soap stars. She also starred in the film \"Divorce Invitation\". \"Dirty Soap\" provided viewers with insight about her decision to leave the show.\n\nBjorlin announced during an interview with \"TV Guide\" on August 21, 2012, that she would return to the role of Chloe, with her first airdate being January 4, 2013. She began filming in September. Speaking out about all of the rumors that had circulated, Bjorlin stated: \"I find out a lot about myself through reading magazines There was a little bit of talk throughout the year. \"Would you ever be interested in returning?\" That sort of thing. But never anything concrete Now the timing is right. It's been a year since we've seen Chloe. Hopefully, the audience has forgotten what she was up to.\" Speaking of her exit storyline the previous year, Bjorlin said that she herself would have written the character out: \"Chloe is so near and dear to my heart and even I would have written her off after that storyline. She was spiraling out of control and the fans had stopped being able to recognize the character. I couldn't recognize her, either! A lot of what made Chloe so lovable — her integrity, her fun, her wit — was gone and I don't blame anyone for dropping her from the show.\" She teased the character's return, hinting that she would return as \"herself\", and will have good self-esteem with a stronger and more confident mentality.\n\nIn addition to Chloe's return to Salem, Patrika Darbo returned as Nancy, after an eight-year absence. Darbo said that Nancy is \"going to be supporting her daughter; whether she’s right or whether she’s gone. Family takes care of family.\" Of working with Bjorlin again, Darbo said they \"just fell right back into it.\" She also noted that in the past seven years, \"some of the things that happened to Chloe would have happened, if Nancy had been there\" and said \"However, she’s back now, and she might start taking care of those people who hurt her daughter.\"\n\nChloe lived in an orphanage for the first fifteen years of her life. Nancy Wesley (Patrika Darbo) offered her the chance to move in with her, and Chloe accepted, later learning Nancy is actually her biological mother. Originally introduced as a brainy \"nerd\" character with few friends, Chloe hides her incredible beauty behind frumpy clothes and horn-rimmed glasses making her an outsider at Salem High where she is picked on and often referred to as \"Ghoul Girl.\" She becomes friends with Shawn-Douglas Brady (Jason Cook), and Belle Black. Chloe goes to a dance with the wealthy Philip Kiriakis, at which time she unveils her true appearance, and Philip immediately falls for her. They date until Chloe learns the first date was all because Philip lost a bet with Shawn. Philip wanting Chloe back, does everything possible to win her back. The two fall in love again, but it is short-lived when Brady Black comes to town. Chloe immediately bonded with Brady over their shared love of the opera. Chloe, still dating Philip, assures him that nothing is going on between them. Brady, and Chloe's relationship begins to grow closer, causing more tension in Philip and Chloe's relationship. Philip attempts to sabotage Brady to make it look like he is a thief, Chloe ends her relationship with him and pursues one with Brady.\n\nMeanwhile, Chloe is diagnosed with leukemia, and with the help of Brady searches for her birth father to provide her with bone marrow. It is ultimately revealed that Nancy's husband Dr. Craig Wesley (Kevin Spirtas) is Chloe's father, Nancy having given Chloe up for adoption without telling Craig. Chloe survives when her sister, Joy, is born and proves to be a match. Shortly after, Chloe leaves town to pursue her dream of being an opera singer in June 2003. Her relationship with Brady suffers from it. Brady is about to confront Chloe about ending their relationship, when Chloe is in a horrible car accident, her face was disfigured. Disgusted with her scars, she makes Brady believe she is dead. She does so for many months, until Brady finds out she is alive. Chloe gets several reconstructive surgeries, restoring her face to its original beauty. Chloe reveals her new face to Brady, at their wedding. After they are married, Chloe and Brady move to Vienna so Chloe can once again pursue her passion for opera singing.\n\nChloe returns in 2007, without Brady. She begins to rekindle her friendship with Belle, Shawn, and Philip. Brady comes back to town, revealing that he has a drug addiction, and that is why he and Chloe broke up. Chloe pursues a relationship with Lucas Horton, but it ends when she cheats on him with Daniel Jonas. Chloe eventually began a relationship with Daniel. Daniel and Chloe were engaged, but their relationship was complicated when Daniel's friend, Carly Manning, came to town, and they discovered that Daniel had fathered Carly's daughter, Melanie Jonas (Molly Burnett).\n\nThe situation was only complicated when Chloe had a hysterical pregnancy and was told that she would probably never have a child. One night, having been tricked by Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) to think that Carly and Daniel were having an affair, Chloe turned to Philip. The two slept together and when Chloe later learned she was pregnant, she did not know if the father was Daniel or Philip. Test results confirmed Daniel as the baby's father so Chloe didn't tell Daniel about the affair. Chloe married Daniel and gave birth to a son Parker. On the day of Parker's baptism, Caroline revealed that she had switched the test results, and that Philip was Parker's father. Daniel was heartbroken and left Chloe. Unable to deal with the pain of losing Daniel, Chloe slipped deep into depression and tried to commit suicide. Social services gave Philip full custody but Philip moved Chloe into the Kiriakis mansion with Parker so they could raise him together.\n\nChloe's mental health was still fragile and during a drunken rant to Kate, Chloe threatened to take Parker and no one would ever see him again. Fearful that she would make good on her threats, Philip took Parker and moved to Chicago. Chloe tried to get herself together by giving voice lessons to students in Salem and petitioning the court for supervised visits with Parker. Then Chloe met a handsome stranger named Quinn Hudson (Bren Foster), whom she hooked up with, later finding out that he had taped the encounter and used it to blackmail her into prostitution. Quinn (later revealed to be Vivian’s estranged son) had been hired by Kate Roberts to ruin Chloe's life and keep her away from Parker. However her call girl days end when she was viciously attacked by Gus, Vivian’s manservant-turned-vigilante who was assaulting hookers, putting her into a second coma (although it was shorter this time). When she awoke from the coma she identified Gus and received a sizable reward which gave her the means to move to Chicago, to pursue a more lucrative singing career and work towards regaining custody of her son, Parker.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, Chloe returned to Salem and revealed to Daniel that he is actually Parker's father, hoping they could be a family again. When Chloe learned Daniel had moved on with Jennifer she set about trying to break them up. Chloe blackmailed Jennifer into rejecting Daniel, by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker, going so far as to have her mother Nancy take Parker to Brazil, but not telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital, to protect Daniel from losing access to his son Parker, while never revealing her true feelings. After seeing a passport at Chloe's mother Nancy's place, Daniel figured out Chloe's scheme, with help from Rafe, and reconciled with Jennifer, who also got her job back at the hospital. After that Chloe decided to go back to Chicago, leaving Parker with Daniel.\n\nOn August 3, 2015, Chloe returned to Salem when she learned Daniel and Nicole were engaged and she objected to Nicole becoming Parker's stepmother. She ultimately accepted after a talk with Daniel.\n\nIn January 2016, Chloe came back to Salem to comfort Nicole after Daniel died in a car accident on New Years Day.\n"}

Matthews regularly appears on other NBC and MSNBC news programs as well.\n\nMatthews was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Mary Teresa (née Shields) and Herb Matthews, a court reporter. Matthews' father was a Protestant of English and Scots-Irish ancestry, and his mother was from an Irish Catholic family; Matthews is a Roman Catholic.\n\nMatthews attended La Salle College High School. Matthews is a 1967 graduate of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and did graduate work in Economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Matthews was also a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Institute of Politics.\n\nMatthews served in the United States Peace Corps in Swaziland from 1968 to 1970 as a trade development adviser.\n\nMatthews holds 34 honorary degrees from numerous universities and colleges, including: The Ohio State University, Washington University, Howard University, College of Holy Cross, Fordham University, Villanova University, La Salle University, Temple University, University of Rochester, Suffolk, New England School of Law, Roosevelt University, St. Joseph's University, Old Dominion University, Hunter College, Lynn University, Stetson, University of South Carolina, Washington College, Quinnipiac University, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, University of Scranton, Drexel University, Washington and Jefferson, St. Leo University, Niagara University, Loyola College, Fontbonne College, Beaver College, Chestnut Hill, and Anna Maria.\n\nMatthews is the recipient of several awards, including The Pennsylvania Society's Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement in 2005, the Abraham Lincoln Award from the Union League of Philadelphia, the David Brinkley Award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Award, and the 2016 Tip O'Neill Irish Diaspora Award.\n\nWhen Matthews first arrived in Washington, D.C., he worked as an officer with the United States Capitol Police. Subsequently, Matthews served on the staffs of four Democratic Members of Congress, including Senators Frank Moss and Edmund Muskie. In 1974, Matthews mounted an unsuccessful campaign for Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in which he received about 24% of the vote in the primary. Matthews was a presidential speechwriter during the Carter Administration, and later worked for six years as Chief of Staff to longtime Speaker of the House of Representatives Tip O'Neill, playing a direct role in many key political battles with the Reagan Administration.\n\nMatthews has said, \"I'm more conservative than people think I am... I voted for George W. in 2000.\" \"Salon.com\" has called him the \"most conservative voice\" on MSNBC's primetime lineup. Matthews has been accused by Media Matters for America of having panels of guests that skew to the right and of supporting Republicans in his own questions and comments.\n\nOn the April 14, 2008, edition of \"The Colbert Report\", Matthews alluded to a possible run for the United States Senate from Pennsylvania. On November 28, 2008, Matthews contacted senior staffers of Barack Obama's campaign about a possible Senate run. On January 7, 2009, \"The New York Times\" reported that Matthews told his staffers that he would not run for the Senate.\n\nWhile discussing proposed healthcare reform on the December 17, 2009, edition of \"Hardball\", Matthews stated, \"The Republicans will know they have lost... Let them keep score and it's easy. It's complicated when liberals get to keep score. We're always arguing. Well, I'm a liberal, too.\"\n\nIn 2004, at the Democratic National Convention, Matthews predicted that he had \"just seen the first black president\".\n\nThe \"Huffington Post\" reported on Matthews' emotional expressions of support for Barack Obama during the 2008 Presidential election, quoting him as saying \"I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often.\" \n\nAccording to a 2011 study, Matthews has a history of making misogynistic comments in his political coverage. The study found that Matthews treated Hillary Clinton worse in the 2008 Democratic primary than any other newsperson. During the primaries, Matthews depicted her with horns on her head, said that the only reason she was a frontrunner in the primary was because \"her husband messed around\", said \"she didn't win there on merit\" and referred to her as a \"she-devil\".\n\nIn March 2012, Chris Matthews described himself as a centrist during an episode of his MSNBC talk show \"Hardball\". That statement was questioned by \"Mediaite\"'s Josh Feldman directly afterward, based on Matthews' frequent condemnation of right-wing political figures and his emotional expression of support for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Feldman observed that Matthews has criticized liberals such as Hillary Clinton and occasionally even Barack Obama, and that this could explain Matthews' description of himself as a \"centrist\".\n\nMatthews worked in print media for 15 years, spending 13 years as Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the \"San Francisco Examiner\" (1987–2000) and two years as a nationally syndicated columnist for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". Matthews covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first all-races election in South Africa, and the Good Friday Peace Talks in Northern Ireland. In 1997 and 1998, his research in the National Archives produced a series of exclusives on the Nixon presidential tapes. Matthews has covered American presidential election campaigns since 1988.\n\nIn 1997, Matthews began his own weeknight talk show, \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\", which originally aired on America's Talking but is currently on MSNBC. \"Hardball\" features pundits and elected officials as guests.\n\n\"The Chris Matthews Show\" aired in syndication from 2002 until 2013. The show was formatted as a political roundtable consisting of four journalists and Matthews, who served as the moderator. He is estimated to earn more than $5 million a year. He is the author of eight best-selling books:\n\n\n\"Elusive Hero\" spent 12 weeks on \"The New York Times\"' bestseller list. The book was lauded by critics. \"Matthews excels in capturing the tribalism of the Irish Catholic culture and experience Kennedy both absorbed and overcame as he made his way...[and] is at his best in describing political dynamics,\" \"The Washington Post\" said. \"Matthews proves a compelling storyteller,\" said \"The Boston Globe\". \"Matthews has produced a valuable addition to the literature about the life and career of our 35th president,\" said \"The Christian Science Monitor\". \"Matthews's stirring biography reveals Kennedy as a 'fighting prince never free from pain, never far from trouble, and never accepting the world he found,'\" said \"Publishers Weekly\".\n\nIn 2013, Matthews announced that he had signed a long-term contract extension with MSNBC but that he would no longer host The Chris Matthews Show in order to focus his efforts on Hardball, writing books, and producing documentaries. The final episode of The Chris Matthews Show aired on July 21.\n\nIn December 2017, several news outlets reported that in 1999, Matthews was accused by a female assistant producer on his program for making inappropriate jokes and comments. He was formally reprimanded by his employer CNBC and his accuser was awarded a $40,000 separation package settlement.\n\nMatthews has been married since 1980 to Kathleen Matthews, who anchored News 7 on WJLA-TV, the ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., before accepting a position as an executive vice president with Marriott International. The couple have three children: Michael, Thomas, and Caroline. His brother Jim Matthews, a Republican, is a former county commissioner in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2002, Matthews was hospitalized with malaria, which he evidently contracted on one of his visits that year to Africa. He has also had other health problems, including diabetes (which he acknowledged having on the \"Hardball\" broadcast of December 7, 2009) and pneumonia.\n\nMatthews is a lifelong Philadelphia Phillies fan, which he claims as \"part of his soul\".\n\nMatthews was the commencement speaker at Ohio State University on May 4, 2014,\n\nChris Matthews has received over 30 Honorary Degrees, These Include\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1823707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823707", "title": "Dogra", "text": "Dogra\n\nThe Dogras are an Indo-Aryan ethno-linguistic group in India and Pakistan consisting of the Dogri language speakers. Dogra Rajputs ruled Jammu from the 19th century, when Gulab Singh was made a hereditary Raja of Jammu by the Sikh Emperor Maharaja Ranjit Singh, till Oct 1947. Through the Treaty of Amritsar (1846), they acquired Kashmir as well. They live predominantly in the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir, and in adjoining areas of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and northeastern Pakistan. The Brahmin Dogras are predominantly Saraswat Brahmins, genetically of common origin with Saraswat Brahmins of Kashmir.\n\nThe Dogra Regiment and the Punjab Regiment of the Indian Army primarily consists of Dogras and Sikhs.\n\nThe term Dogra is thought to derive from \"Durgara\", the name of a kingdom mentioned in an eleventh century copper-plate inscription in Chamba. The inscription mentions the Raja of Chamba facing an attack by Kiras aided by the Lord of Durgara (\"durgāreśwara\"). In medieval times the term \"Durgar\" is believed to have turned into \"Dugar\", eventually transforming to \"Dogra\". Kalhana's \"Rajatarangini\" makes no mention of a kingdom by any of these names, but the kingdoms could have been referred to by their capital cities (such as \"Vallapura\", modern Billawar, or \"Babbapura\", modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the Dogri language, irrespective of their religion.\n\nScholar Omachanda Handa believes that the Durgara people were originally migrants from Rajasthan to the Terai belt, similar to the Gurjaras (or \"Gujjars\"). The allusion to \"durg\" (fort) in their name indicates that they may have remained a warrior people, eventually founding powerful kingdoms between Chenab and Ravi, and possibly dominating up to the Sutluj river.\n\nAccording to M. A. Stein, there were some eleven Dogra states in the region, all of which were eventually absorbed into the Jammu state, which emerged as the most powerful among them. Prior to the rise of Jammu, Babbapura (Babor) is expected to have been the chief state of Dogras. Lying 45 km east of Jammu, Babor contains the ruins of six magnificent temples representing a \"thriving artistic activity\". The Rajatarangini mentions the Raja Vajradhara of Babbapura, vowing allegiance to Bhikshachara of Kashmir in 1120 AD, along with the chiefs of neighbouring kingdoms.\n\nThe Jammu region, one of the three regions of Jammu and Kashmir state (the others being the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh), is bound on the north by the Pir Panjal Range of the middle Himalayas, in the south by Punjab, to the east by Ladakh, and close to the west by Pakistan. The lower Himalayan ranges begin behind the town of Jammu, which rests on a slope over above sea level, overlooking and commanding the plain watered by the Chenab, Ravi, Tawi and Ujh rivers. The Jammu region consists of ten districts: Jammu, Kathua, Udhampur, Doda, Poonch, Kishtwar, Reasi, Samba, Ramban and Rajouri. The city of Jammu is the winter capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe Jammu Dogras traditionally inhabited the area between the slopes of the Shivalik range of mountains, the sacred lakes of Saroien sar and Mannsar but later spread over whole of Jammu region. They generally speak Dogri and other dialects similar to Dogri. The majority of the Dogra are followers of Hinduism, but a large number in Jammu and Kashmir believe in other religions. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some Dogras embraced Islam. These factors, together with the effects of immigration into the region, have resulted in the Dogra population of Jammu and Kashmir including members of all three religions. \n\nThe Dogra Raj emerged as a regional power, particularly after Maharaja Gulab Singh emerged as a warrior and his subjects received special martial recognition from the British Raj. The rule of Gulab Singh's Raj extended over the whole of the Jammu Region, a large part of the Ladakh region as early as March 1846, and a large part of the Indian Punjab (now Himachal Pradesh). The Kashmir Valley was handed over to Gulab Singh by the British government, for assisting the British during the Anglo-Sikh wars, as part of the territories ceded to the British government by Lahore State according to the provisions of Article IV of the Treaty of Lahore dated 9March 1846. Under the Treaty of Amritsar in the same year, the Dogra king of Jammu and the state was thereafter known as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir State (Raj), also thereafter referred as Kashmir State. The term Dogra hence is more akin to the subjects of Himachal Pradesh, some areas of Punjab and the whole region of Jammu that was ruled by Raja Gulab Singh as part of the Dogra Raj irrespective of the religion of the inhabitants.\n\n\nDogra dynasty was a dynasty of Hindu Rajputs who ruled Jammu & Kashmir from 1846 to 1947. They traced their ancestry to the Ikshvaku (Solar) Dynasty of Northern India (the same clan in which Lord Rama was born; he, therefore, is the 'kuldevta' (family deity) of the Dogras). \n\nAmong the enlightened rulers of Jammu was Raja Ranjit Dev (1728–1780) who introduced certain social reforms such as a ban on 'Sati' (immolation of the wife on the funeral pyre of the husband) and female infanticide. Later, under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the state became part of the Sikh Empire of the Punjab after it was captured from its Afghan rulers. Ranjit Singh rendered this state to his general, Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal, who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. He extended the boundaries of Jammu to western Tibet with the help of General Zorawar Singh. \n\nThe Sikh Empire rule extended beyond the Jammu Region and the Kashmir Valley to the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of Ladakh and the Emirates of Hunza, Gilgit and Nagar. After the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, the British gave Kashmir and the title of 'Maharaja' to Gulab Singh — the chief minister — as a reward for aligning with them against the Sikhs.\n\nWheat, maize and bajra are staple food besides rice, cereals and a tangier preparation made out of mango or tamarind popularly known as \"maani\". The whole dish is called \"dal puth maani\" and is savoured as a combination. \"Mitha madra\" is a favourite and is cooked from milk, dry fruits, and semolina. Preparations of \"rajmash\" (a special variety of red kidney beans); \"auria\" a dish of curd fermented by rye; \"ambal\" made from pumpkin, jaggery and tamarind are favourites, especially during ceremonial cooking. The expert cooks are called \"Siyans\", usually Brahmins. \"Kalari\" is a milk preserved by cogulation of proteins and then fried in a pan to make it delicious.\n\nNon-vegetarian food was limited to Rajputs and Vaish (Mahajans). 'Khatta meat' is mutton cooked with sour pomegranate seeds (Anardana) or lime juice and flavoured with fumes of a burning charcoal soaked in mustard oil. Keur is one of the well known foods of Dogras. It is prepared by flour and butter and served with sugar and curd. Mostly, it is served to bridegroom at the time of marriage by the in-laws. Kalaari is a favourite food of Dogras in the rainy season. It is prepared by flour mix, cottage cheese and milk cream (malai) with water with help of a small cup shaped pot. Kalari is served with milk. Kalari cheese is popular in the Jammu region and in Jammu and Kashmir state more generally. Babbru/pathoru are prepared with flour and fried in mustard oil. Babbru is served with maani/potato/kheer/curd.\n\nKheer is a dish prepared from milk by adding some rice and dry fruit in it. It is served at all the special occasions and festivals. Another popular exotic dish is \"guchiyyan\" (dried black morel), usually added as an ingredient in pulao. As it grows naturally in forests and cannot be cultivated, it is a priced commodity (approx 500 Rs. per 100 g) and makes an excelled dish with mountain potatoes (pahadi aloo). Saffron or kesar is extensively used to flavour sweet dishes and for its anti-oxidant benefits.\n\nThe Dogra Regiment was among the regiments of the British Indian Army, which made significant contributions in both the world wars on all fronts from East Asia to Europe and North Africa. At Independence, it became an infantry regiment of the Indian Army composed largely but not exclusively of the Dogra people. The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, another regiment of the Indian Army, consisting of mainly Dogras was formed out of the former army of the Kingdom of Jammu & Kashmir after it was absorbed into the Indian Army.\n\n\n"}

She was for many years reputed to be the author of \"The Whole Duty of Man\". She enjoyed the esteem and friendship of the most eminent divines of her time. Dr. Henry Hammond resided at her home for several years.\n\nDorothy Coventry was born in or near London about the middle of the reign of James I. She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Coventry, the Lord Keeper, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1583–1653), daughter of John Aldersey of Spurstow, Cheshire, and widow of William Pitchford. \n\nShe married Sir John Pakington, 2nd Baronet (1621–1680), of Westwood, Worcestershire. The couple had at least three surviving children: one son and two daughters.\n\nA fervent royalist, Dorothy Pakington wrote manuscript prayers, and shared in the circulation of religious and philosophical manuscripts in the group of clergymen around the king's chaplain, Henry Hammond. The extent of her reputation is shown by the fact that contemporaries believed her the author of \"The Whole Duty of Man\". Although George Ballard defended this attribution, modern scholars instead follow two nineteenth-century writers — Richard Barham and C. E. Doble — who attributed the work to Hammond's friend Richard Allestree. She led a retired life, and devoted herself to learning, piety, and good works. She was the author of several religious books: \"The Gentleman’s Calling\", \"The Lady’s Calling\", \"The Government of the Tongue\", \"The Christian’s Birthright\", and \"The Causes of the Decay of Christian Piety\".\n\nPakington died 10 May 1679.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2926808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2926808", "title": "Edward Oxford", "text": "Edward Oxford\n\nEdward Oxford (19 April 1822 – 23 April 1900) was the first of seven people who tried to assassinate Queen Victoria. After Oxford was arrested and charged with treason, a jury found that Oxford was not guilty by reason of insanity and he was detained at Her Majesty's pleasure in the State Criminal Lunatic Asylum and later, in Broadmoor Hospital. Eventually given conditional release for transportation to a British colony, he lived out the remainder of his life in Australia.\n\nEdward was born in Birmingham in 1822, the third of Hannah Marklew and George Oxford's seven children. His father, a gold chaser, died when he was seven. His mother was able to find work and support the family, which meant Edward was able to attend school both in Birmingham and the Lambeth area of London, where the family moved when he was about 10. When Oxford left school, he first took bar work with his aunt in Hounslow, then in other public houses as a pot boy, or waiter. At the time of the attack he was barely eighteen years old, unemployed and living with his mother and sister in lodgings in Camberwell, having recently quit his job at the Hog-in-the-Pound in Oxford Street. Since his mother had returned to Birmingham on a regular trip to see family over a month before, Oxford was, in effect, living alone at the time of the event.\n\nOn 4 May 1840, he bought a pair of pistols for £2, as well as a gunpowder flask, and began practising in various shooting galleries in Leicester Square, the Strand and the West End. A week before the attack, he went into a Lambeth shop owned by a former schoolmate named Gray and bought fifty copper percussion caps, and enquired where he could buy some bullets and three-pennies' worth of gunpowder. Gray sold him the powder, and told him where he could find the ammunition. On the evening of 9 June he showed several witnesses what appeared to be a loaded pistol; when he was asked what he planned to do with it, he refused to say, other than stating that he had been firing at a target.\n\nAt about 4:00 PM on 10 June 1840, Oxford took up a position on a footpath at Constitution Hill, near Buckingham Palace. The Queen, who was four months pregnant with her first child, was accustomed to riding out in a phaeton, or low, open horse-drawn carriage, with her husband, Prince Albert in the late afternoon or early evening, with no other escort than two outriders. When the royal couple appeared some two hours later and drew level with him, he fired both pistols in succession, missing both times. He was immediately seized by onlookers and disarmed. Oxford made no attempt to hide his actions, openly declaring: \"It was I, it was me that did it.\"\n\nHe was immediately arrested and charged with treason for attempting to assassinate the sovereign. When he was taken into custody at the police station he asked if the Queen was hurt; he was informed she was unharmed. When he was asked if the pistols had been loaded, he said they were. After his arrest, his lodgings were searched and a locked box was found containing a sword and scabbard, two pistol-bags, powder, a bullet-mould, five lead balls, some of the percussion caps bought from Gray, and the intricate rules and proceedings of an imaginary military society called \"Young England\" (not to be confused with the later conservative political group of the same name), complete with a list of made-up officers and correspondence. Members were to be armed with a brace of pistols, a sword, a rifle and a dagger.\n\nOxford's trial at the Old Bailey was postponed until 9 July, after a thorough investigation was made of both his background and his possible motives. In spite of his earlier admissions, no bullets could be found at the scene, so that the Crown could not prove that the pistols were, in fact, armed and that he could have harmed anyone. Oxford later claimed that the guns contained only gunpowder.\n\nOxford appeared to be oblivious for most of the proceedings. The prosecution presented much eyewitness evidence, while the defence case consisted of various family members and friends who testified that Oxford had always seemed of unsound mind, and that both his grandfather and father were alcoholics who had exhibited signs of mental illness. This carried a great deal of weight, as it was thought during this time that both drink and hereditary influence were strong causal factors for insanity. Oxford's mother testified her late husband had been violent and intimidating, and that her son was not only prone to fits of hysterical laughter and emitting strange noises, he had been obsessed with firearms since he was a child. Various eminent pathologists and physicians testified that due to \"brain disease\" or other factors, such as the shape of his head, Oxford was either a mental imbecile or simply incapable of controlling himself.\n\nThe following day, the jury acquitted Oxford, declaring him to be \"not guilty by reason of insanity\". Like all such prisoners, he was sentenced to be detained \"until Her Majesty's pleasure be known\". In effect, this was an indefinite sentence, and the source of the asylum term \"pleasure men\". Oxford was sent to the State Criminal Lunatic Asylum in Bethlem, Southwark, where he remained as a model patient for the next twenty-four years. During that time he occupied himself by drawing, reading and learning to play the violin; the Bethlem doctors reported that he could play draughts and chess better than any other patient, He also learnt French, German and Italian to a degree of fluency, acquired some knowledge of Spanish, Greek and Latin, and was employed as a painter and decorator within the confines of the hospital. When he was transferred to Broadmoor Hospital in 1864, the notes taken on his arrival describe him as \"apparently sane\". He still claimed the pistols he fired at the Queen were not loaded with anything other than powder, and that his attack was fuelled not by a desire to injure her, but purely by a desire for notoriety.\n\nOxford continued to be orderly and well-behaved at Broadmoor, working as a wood grainer and painter. While it was clear to the hospital's governors that Oxford was of sound mind and no longer a threat to society, George Grey, the current Home Secretary, ignored the request to order his release. It is possible that since he had been the Judge Advocate General at the time of Oxford's trial, he could have been reluctant to discharge a prisoner he once had such a vested interest in incarcerating. It was not until three years later that a new Home Secretary offered to discharge Oxford, on the condition that he leave for one of the Empire's overseas colonies, and, if he returned to the United Kingdom, he would be incarcerated for life.\n\nOxford lived out the rest of his life in Melbourne, Australia. Oxford landed in Melbourne with a new alias, John Freeman. Setting out to reform himself and become a respectable citizen, Freeman became a house painter and joined the West Melbourne Mutual Improvement Society. In 1881 he married a widow with two children, and became a church warden at St Paul's Cathedral. Under the pseudonym \"Liber\" he wrote articles for \"The Argus\" about the city's slums, markets and racetracks, and these became the basis for an 1888 book, \"Lights and Shadows of Melbourne Life.\" Freeman died in 1900.\n\nHis patient record at Broadmoor includes a letter sent in 1883 by George Haydon, a Steward at Bethlem, to Dr. David Nicolson. It includes an article from \"The Age\", a Melbourne newspaper, which reports that on 4 May 1880, a \"John\" Oxford, identified as the man who shot at the Queen many years ago, and who had subsequently been a patient in an asylum before he was discharged to Australia, had recently been convicted of stealing a shirt and spent a week in jail. Upon his release, the prison governor requested the police to keep an eye on him, \"in consequence of the old man’s eccentric conduct\". The police subsequently arrested Oxford for vagrancy, and he was reportedly remanded for further medical examination. There were no further updates to the record. It is not certain that this person was Edward Oxford.\n\nThe connection between Oxford and \"John Freeman\" was established by F. B. Smith's 1987 article \"Lights and Shadows in the Life of John Freeman\". Freeman wrote several letters to Haydon, beginning in 1888 and apparently ceasing on Haydon's death in 1889. Freeman's wife and stepchildren appear to have been totally ignorant that he might be anyone other than John Freeman. Additionally, a photograph of John Freeman taken for the 1888 Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne matches a portrait of Oxford held in the archives of the Bethlem aslyum. Freeman's correspondence to Haydon was donated to the National Library in the 1950s by the family. Stevens points out that the former Steward contributed nothing more to Oxford's Broadmoor record about his progress beyond the troubling report published in the newspaper, and never confirmed that Oxford was the author of Freeman's book. This may have been because Haydon was departing Bethlem at the time he began receiving the letters.\n\nDespite the historical precedent of the insanity defence, Queen Victoria represented popular opinion when she remained morally convinced that Oxford and other malefactors who came after him were perfectly cognisant of their actions. She was furious when Daniel M'Naghten, who attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel and instead killed his private secretary, was acquitted in 1843. When Roderick McLean attempted to shoot her on the Windsor railway platform forty years later and was sent to Broadmoor, her response was to demand of Prime Minister Gladstone that the law be changed to \"guilty but insane\", to better accommodate her unwavering belief that if Oxford had only been hanged at the outset, his death would have acted as a deterrent to other potential regicides:\nA contemporary reference to Oxford appears in Charles Dickens' \"The Old Curiosity Shop\", the novel that Dickens was writing during the months before and after the attempted regicide. Although Dickens took a strong interest in the case, Oxford appears not in Dickens's text, which was serialised in his weekly publication, \"Master Humphrey's Clock\", but in one of the novel's accompanying illustrations, rendered by Hablot K. Browne, popularly known as \"Phiz\".\n\nIn an illustration for Chapter 28, Mrs. Jarley, the proprietress of a waxworks, is shown training the heroine, Little Nell, to be a guide. Although the novel is set some fifteen years before 1840, Browne was no doubt inspired by Madame Tussauds' London waxworks, where the exhibit of Edward Oxford was a star attraction for that year, to create a contemporary reference. His caricature of the would-be assassin as a wide-eyed, imbecilically grinning youth, clutching a flintlock pistol in his right hand and a pot of beer in his left, with a sheet of paper labelled “Young England” spilling out of his pocket, was easily identifiable by anyone at the time. In the direct line of fire behind him sits a calmly serene Queen Victoria, dressed in her 1838 coronation robes and holding the orb and sceptre. While Oxford's pistol may be pointing in her direction, \"Phiz\" reassuringly depicts the sovereign as literally far above her attacker, serenely and majestically removed from the lunatic's threat.\n\nOxford is a major character in Mark Hodder's 2010 novel, \"The Strange Affair of Spring-Heeled Jack\", in which one of his descendants also named Edward Oxford from the year 2202 travels back in time to stop his ancestor from even attempting the act.\n\nSamuel Warren is believed to have used Oxford as a model for his portrait of the shallow, dissolute youth Titbat Tittlemouse in his popular novel 'Ten Thousand a Year'.\n\nEdward Oxford, \"Young England\" and the assassination attempt are plot elements in David Morrell's 2015 novel, \"Inspector of the Dead\", which takes place 15 years after the attempt. In the novel, the second in his Thomas de Quincy series, his detective Inspector Ryan is identified as having been one of the constables on the scene at the time of the attempt.\n\nIn 2009 an inaccurate version of the assassination attempt was portrayed in \"The Young Victoria\". While Oxford (played by Josef Altin) is shown firing twice on the royal couple, Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) throws himself in front of Victoria (Emily Blunt) and is wounded by Oxford's second bullet (contradicting the historic record that no bullets were found). A scene in which the police search his lodgings and find newspaper illustrations of the royal pair papering the glass skylight was not included in the theatrical release.\n\nOxford's assassination attempt is also depicted in the first series finale of the 2016 TV series \"Victoria\", in which Oxford is played by Harry McEntire. Within the show, suggestions are raised that Oxford was acting under the orders of Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, who would have acceded to the throne if both Victoria and her unborn child were to die; however, it is ultimately concluded that Oxford is delusional and has been writing letters from Hanover to himself.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4859933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4859933", "title": "Eugene Pallette", "text": "Eugene Pallette\n\nEugene William Pallette (July 8, 1889 – September 3, 1954) was an American actor. He appeared in over 240 silent era and sound era motion pictures between 1913 and 1946.\n\nAfter an early career as a slender leading man, Pallette became a stout character actor. He had a deep voice, which some critics have likened to the sound of a croaking frog, and is probably best-remembered for comic character roles such as Alexander Bullock, Carole Lombard's character's father, in \"My Man Godfrey\" (1936), as Friar Tuck in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938) starring Errol Flynn, and his similar role as Fray Felipe in \"The Mark of Zorro\" (1940) starring Tyrone Power.\n\nHe was born in Winfield, Kansas, the son of William Baird Pallette (1858–?) and Elnora \"Ella\" Jackson (1860–1906). His sister was Beulah L. Pallette (1880–1968).\n\nPallette attended Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana. He then began his acting career on the stage in stock company roles, appearing for a period of six years.\n\nPallette began his silent film career as an extra in about 1911. His first credited appearance was in the one-reel short western/drama \"The Fugitive\" (1913) which was directed by Wallace Reid for Flying \"A\" Studios at Santa Barbara.\n\nQuickly advancing to featured status, Pallette appeared in many westerns. He worked with D. W. Griffith on such films as \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915) and \"Intolerance\" (1916). At this time, he had a slim, athletic figure, a far cry from his portly build later in his career. He starred as the slender sword-fighting swashbuckler Aramis in Douglas Fairbanks' 1921 version of \"The Three Musketeers\", one of the great smash hits of the silent era.\n\nAfter gaining a great deal of weight, he became one of the screen's most recognizable character actors. In 1927, he signed as a regular for Hal Roach Studios and was a reliable comic foil in several early Laurel and Hardy movies. In later years, Pallette's weight may have topped out at more than 300 pounds (136 kg).\n\nThe advent of the talkies proved to be the second major career boost for Pallette. His inimitable rasping gravel voice (described as \"half an octave below anyone else in the cast\") made him one of Hollywood's most sought-after character actors in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe typical Pallette role was the comically exasperated head of the family (\"My Man Godfrey\", \"The Lady Eve\"), the cynical backroom sharpy (\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"), or the gruff detective (\"The Kennel Murder Case\"). Pallette's best-known role may be as Friar Tuck in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", and his similar appearance in \"The Mark of Zorro\".\n\nBBC commentator Dana Gioia described Pallette's onscreen appeal:\nThe mature Pallette character is a creature of provocative contradictions—tough-minded but indulgent, earthy but epicurean, relaxed but excitable. His grit and gravel voice sounds simultaneously tough and comic. ... Pallette uses his girth to create a common touch. Stuffed into a tuxedo that seems perpetually near bursting, he seems more down-to-earth than the stylish high society types who surround him.\n\nPallette was cast as the father of lead actress Jeanne Crain for the film \"In the Meantime, Darling\" (1944). Director Otto Preminger clashed with Pallette and claimed he was \"an admirer of Hitler and convinced that Germany would win the war\". Pallette refused to sit at the same table with black actor Clarence Muse in a scene set in a kitchen. \"You're out of your mind, I won't sit next to a nigger\", Pallette hissed at Preminger. Preminger furiously informed Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who fired Pallette. Although Pallette remains in scenes he already had filmed, the remainder of his role not yet shot was eliminated from the script.\n\nIn increasingly ill health by his late 50s, Pallette made fewer and fewer movies, and for lesser studios. His final movie, \"Suspense\", was released in 1946.\n\nIn 1946, convinced that there was going to be a \"world blow-up\" by atomic bombs, the hawkish Pallette received considerable publicity when he set up a \"mountain fortress\" on a ranch near Imnaha, Oregon, as a hideaway from universal catastrophe. The \"fortress\" reportedly was stocked with a sizable herd of prize cattle, enormous supplies of food, and had its own canning plant and lumber mill.\n\nWhen the \"blow-up\" he anticipated failed to materialize after two years, he began disposing of the Oregon ranch and returned to Los Angeles and his movie colony friends. He never appeared in another movie, however. \n\nEugene Pallette died at age 65 in 1954 from throat cancer at his apartment, 10835 Wilshire Boulevard, in Los Angeles. His wife, Marjorie, and his sister, Beulah Phelps, were at his side. Private funeral services were conducted on Saturday, September 4, 1954, at the Armstrong Family Mortuary. His cremated remains are interred in an unmarked grave behind the monument of his parents at Green Lawn Cemetery in Grenola, Kansas. \n\nHe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6702 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to motion pictures.\n\n"}

The first angle of the grilling accused Dr Maasouma of committing violations in the Foreign Medical Treatment Department and toying with ministerial law 2007/25 issued by the minister after assuming office. Indicating according to the law only those patients suffering from diseases for which treatment is not available in Kuwait can be sent for treatment abroad according to the recommendation of a specialized panel of doctors and the physicians in charge of the patient, the MPs said in their grilling motion \"as per the law the Health Minister and undersecretaries of health cannot interfere in the decision. However, this law was never implemented and was repeatedly violated under the minister's supervision.\"\n\nOn December 10, 2007, the parliament passed a bill, supported by Al-Otaib and Ali Al-Omair, which amended the penal code so that anyone \"imitating the appearance of a member of the opposite sex\" could be jailed for up to a year or fined up to 1,000 dinars.

The two often rode in pursuit of cattle rustlers and horse thieves, dealing with them harshly. On July 18, 1876, he and Frank Coe, accompanied by Doc Scurlock, Charlie Bowdre and Ab Saunders forced their way into the weak Lincoln jail and freed horse thief Jesus Largo from Sheriff Saturnino Baca.

{"id": "803706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=803706", "title": "Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation", "text": "Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation\n\nThe Golden Hill Paugussett is a state-recognized Native American tribe in Connecticut. Granted reservations in a number of towns in the 17th century, their land base was whittled away until they were forced to reacquire a small amount of territory in the 19th century. Today they retain a state-recognized reservation in the town of Trumbull, and have an additional reservation acquired in 1978 and 1980 in Colchester, Connecticut.\n\nThey descend from the historic Paugussett, an Algonguian-speaking nation who historically occupied much of western Connecticut prior to the arrival of European colonists. They are among the five tribes recognized by the state. They were denied federal recognition in 2004.\n\nThe 100-member tribe lives primarily in urban areas of Southwestern Connecticut due to the miniscule size of its reserve in the Nichols section of Trumbull, Connecticut. Several members presently reside in Colchester, Connecticut, where the tribe has a second reservation.\n\nIn 2009, a state court dismissed a challenge to the tribe's status as Indians, refusing to eject members of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe from reservations in Trumbull and Colchester.\n\nWhile the history of the Paugusset people began long before the European encounter, the early written records are European accounts. They are one of the numerous Algonquian-speaking nations who emerged in the coastal areas of the Atlantic. Historically, they occupied a region from present-day Norwalk to West Haven, and from Long Island Sound inland for as far as they could navigate by canoe on the Housatonic and Naugatuck rivers.\n\nThe tribe was made up of four primary sub-groups, the Paugussett Proper in what is present-day Milford, Derby and Shelton; the Pequonnock, along the coast; the Pootatuck in Newtown, Woodbury and Southbury; and the Weantinock in New Milford. They had a farming and fishing culture. The women cultivated varieties of staple crops: corn, beans, and squash, and tobacco, which was used for ritual purposes. The men fished in both fresh and salt water. The size of midden shell heaps along the coast and the amount of cleared land attested to both a long period of occupation and a high degree of social organization among the people.\n\nWhile the Paugusset did not have early direct contact with Europeans, they came in contact with other Native Americans who did, and were exposed to the smallpox epidemic in 1633—35, which caused many deaths. They learned of the English and allies' war against the Pequot in 1637, with the defeat of that nation. English settlers first arrived in Paugussett lands in 1638—39, establishing settlements in New Haven, Guilford, Milford, Stratford and Fairfield.\n\nWithin a few years, the Paugussett had been divested by the colonists of the vast majority of their lands. A reservation was set aside in 1639 at Golden Hill, site of a spring sacred to the tribe, in present-day Bridgeport. Another reservation was established at Turkey Hill in present-day Derby. In 1802, the state-appointed tribal overseer sold Golden Hill. A replacement reservation was created at Turkey Meadows in Trumbull in 1841, but it was sold off in 1854. The last of Turkey Hill was also sold by the state in 1826 for the people's \"own benefit\".\n\nAccording to Bridgeport City Historian Charles Brilvitch's history of the Golden Hill tribe, beginning in the 1820s a number of Paugussett, under the leadership of Joel Freeman, a Turkey Hill Indian from Derby, relocated to Bridgeport. They settled in the city's South End. The area became known as Ethiope or Liberia. While this community consisted substantially of residents who identified as Paugussett, it included Natives from the Mahican, Shinnecock, Nehantic, and Munsee-Delaware nations as well. Freeman was followed by two of his sisters, Mary and Eliza, who built houses in 1848 that are still standing. They have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places. \n\nDuring the antebellum period, the Paugussett and other Native Americans achieved a substantial degree of economic success. Many of the men worked on whaling ships and West Indies trading vessels, while many women residents worked as cooks and waitstaff on the steamboats plying Long Island Sound and the Hudson River. Two churches, a Masonic lodge, resort hotel, school and other community institutions were built in the village. \n\nOnly one individual named \"Joel Freeman\" was recorded in Census and vital records of the state of Connecticut during this period. Nevertheless, the Bureau of Indian Affairs disputed whether the man who led the Ethiope-Liberia community was the same individual listed as a signatory on Turkey Hill Indian deeds. Because the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses identified the builders as African Americans, the BIA disputed whether the sisters and Joel Freeman could be considered members of the Paugusset community. However, Charles Brilvitch, who ironically had authored the 1998 nomination, maintains that his African American identification was merely a mistaken attempt to interpret the term \"colored\" used in documents of the period \n\nThe confusion about cultural identification as Native Americans has affected other communities that have worked to demonstrate cultural continuity. Native American nations were used to absorbing people of other ethnicities and intermarried with neighbors. There has been disagreement among groups over an interpretation of the term \"mulatto,\" which has a primary association of African-European mixed race but has frequently been applied to other people of color. \n\nAround 1857 William Sherman (1825-1886), a whaler by trade withdrew from the Liberia community and settled in the village of Nichols Farms in the Town of Trumbull, Connecticut, the site of the 1841-54 Turkey Meadows reservation. In 1875, he purchased a quarter-acre plot of land that contained a Paugussett burial ground; he used funds from the Golden Hill Tribal Fund to construct a house on it. He is referred to in local histories of the 1880s as the chief of the tribe. Prior to his death in 1886, Sherman turned the property over to the state overseer in trust for the Golden Hill tribe. The land was accepted by the State of Connecticut in that year as an official reservation.\n\nSubsequently, his son George Sherman (b. 1871) took over the leadership of the Golden Hill people; he lived on the reservation and led the people until his death in 1938. He was succeeded by his son Edward (1896-1974), who was known as \"Chief Black Hawk.\" Meanwhile, Edward's sister, Ethel (1893-1993), was installed in 1933 as \"Chieftess Rising Star\". Ethel was active in the Pan-Indian movement and was a staunch advocate of Indian rights, fighting many battles in the courts of law and public opinion. She named her son Aurelius H. Piper (1916-2008) as \"Chief Big Eagle\" in 1959. Following the death of Chief Black Hawk in 1974, Piper (Chief Big Eagle) assumed full leadership of the tribe and took up residency on the Trumbull reservation. He obtained grants to purchase land in Colchester, Connecticut for the community in 1978 and 1980. This land was granted formal reservation status by the state legislature in 1981.\n\nOn May 1, 1991, due to advancing age, Chief Big Eagle named his son, Aurelius H. Piper, Jr. (b. 1945), as Chief of Chiefs and Hereditary Chief of the Golden Hill Tribe. Known as Chief Quiet Hawk, Piper is an ex-Marine and former social worker who was then serving as executive director of American Indians for Development, Inc. Immediately upon assuming leadership he launched the Golden Hill Indian Development Corporation, with the purpose of economic development of the reservation properties for the benefit of the tribal membership.\n\nIn September, 1992, Quiet Hawk filed a lawsuit to reclaim lands taken from the tribe in violation of the federal Nonintercourse Act. The tribe at first sought to reclaim the 12-acre Nimrod Lot and the 8-acre Rocky Hill Lot in the city of Bridgeport, both sold off by the State of Connecticut in 1802 without the stipulated approval of both houses of Congress. In November, 1992, he advanced the claim to include the 19 3/4-acre Turkey Meadows Reservation in Trumbull. Concurrently, the tribe sued for the remainder of the 80-acre Golden Hill Reservation in Bridgeport. Within a few short weeks historic reservation lands in the towns of Milford, Orange, Woodbridge, Stratford, and Shelton were added; intent was made known to press claims in 24 state municipalities, comprising $44 billion worth of property and 640,000 defendants.\n\nAn overriding priority of Chief Quiet Hawk's administration has been the quest for federal recognition. A grant for this purpose was obtained from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1992. Another priority has been to utilize modern technology to facilitate interaction among tribal members and to strengthen community bonds and spiritual focus.\n\nIn 1993 the tribe made national headlines when it opened a tax-free cigarette shop on the Colchester reservation, asserting its sovereignty in selling the product without taking taxes. An armed standoff with state police ensued that ended without violence when Chief Moon Face Bear (Kenneth Piper) agreed to close the shop. In the resulting state court case, the court ruled in \"State v. Piper,\" No. CR21-57349 (May 3, 1996), that the tribe did not have exemption from the state requirement to collect taxes on sales of cigarettes as it was not federally recognized.\n\nChief Big Eagle first submitted a request to the BIA in 1982 seeking federal recognition of the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe. That request was not acted on or further pursued by the BIA. Early in 1990 Chief Big Eagle appointed Chief Quiet Hawk to pursue the quest for federal recognition and also to pursue the land claims in the state of Connecticut.\n\nIn a final determination in 1996, the Bureau of Indian Affairs denied recognition to the Golden Hill Paugussett. The tribe appealed under BIA provisions and submitted additional historic and genealogical documentation. They were denied federal recognition in 2004. Since the legislative changes that have enabled federally recognized tribes to establish gambling casinos on their lands, some tribes have gained significant revenue for welfare, education, and development from gambling revenues, including two in Connecticut.\n\nIn 2015, the Bureau of Indian Affairs revised the acknowledgment criteria, requiring petitioners to prove continuity only back to 1900 (rather than to the time of first contact) and accepting State recognition and the existence of tribal reservations as evidence of a continuing government-to-government relationship. Seeing that this would virtually guarantee recognition of the Paugussett and other state tribes, the Connecticut congressional delegation insisted on the insertion of a clause stipulating that tribes which have previously been denied federal recognition could not re-petition.\n\nWhile the state has gained considerable revenues from its share of income generated by the two major established casino resorts, Connecticut officials have been opposed to recognition of additional tribes and addition of gambling sites in the state. State officials lobbied the BIA in opposition to recognition of the Golden Hill Paugussett.\n\nThe governor, Congressional delegation, and private property owners later mounted challenges and conducted lobbying to reverse the federal recognition granted to the Eastern Pequot Nation in 2002, and the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation in 2004. They succeeded in gaining a BIA review of both cases; after a change in political administrations, recognition of both tribes was revoked in 2005, actions without precedent.\n\nTogether with providing documentation and working to regain tribal status, the Paugusset filed land rights claims against the state, saying the state did not have the authority to manage or sell land on their behalf and had cost them the loss of substantial lands since colonial times. Lack of federal recognition has deprived them of automatic standing in such suits.\n\nInitiated by Chief Big Eagle, the Paugussett originally had claimed legal rights to of land running from Orange/Woodbridge in New Haven County though Fairfield County to Greenwich and extending North into Eastern Litchfield County up to the Massachusetts border. The Paugusset have since dropped these large claims.\n\nIn 1992, Chief Quiet Hawk filed a lawsuit claiming 80 acres in Bridgeport, the site of Golden Hill, which the state had sold in 1802, as well as land in Trumbull and Orange. In 1993, the federal District Court judge Peter Dorsey concluded that Connecticut had violated the 1790 Non-Intercourse Act by selling Indian lands without the approval of the federal government. But he dismissed the case, pending resolution of the BIA's review of the Paugusset petition for federal recognition. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the dismissal. Citing other cases, it noted that criteria for an Indian group's pursuit of land claims were not necessarily the same as for federal recognition.\n\nIn 2006, a federal district court judge dismissed the Golden Hill Paugussett's 14-year-old lawsuit claiming lands in Orange, Trumbull and Bridgeport, based on the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs' rejection of the tribe's petition for federal recognition. The Golden Hill Paugusset had contended that, since they were a Native American nation, the state did not have the authority to deal with them on land sales or dispose of their land. Since the United States was formed, the federal government had reserved to itself authority over dealings with Native American nations and required approval by the Senate of any sale of Indian lands.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was eventually defeated by Raden Wijaya, Kertanegara's son-in-law using the troops of the Mongol Yuan dynasty that were invading Java. Raden Wijaya would later turn against the Mongols and found Majapahit, the greatest empire in Java.\n\nSince 1271, Jayakatwang was viceroy (or governor) of Kediri, a vassal state of Singhasari. Kediri was formerly the dominant kingdom in Java until overthrown in 1222 by Ken Arok, the first king of Singhasari. Jayakatwang was probably a descendant of the Kediri royal line, and thus held ambition to restore his line to power and rulership of Java.\n\nHis name is derived from Sanskrit \"Jaya\" (\"victory\") and Javanese \"ketawang\", (\"rising, or appearing\").\n\nKediri is located in fertile rice-producing area in Brantas River banks, approximately 80 km to the west of Singhasari, but separated from it by the Arjuno-Welirang volcanoes and Mount Kawi.\n\nKertanegara, the fifth ruler of Singhasari, was an ambitious man. In 1289, Mongol emissary came to Java to demand his submission to the Great Khan of the Yuan dynasty. Kertanegara rejected, cut their ears and sent them back to China. Anticipating Mongolian revenge, he prepared to thwart the forthcoming invasion by conquering important ports and kingdoms in Maritime Southeast Asia. His most important expedition was the Pamalayu expedition to Sumatra in 1292, where he sent the Javanese army to conquer Sumatra from various successor states of Srivijaya.\n\nWith the bulk of the Javanese army overseas, Jayakatwang seized his chance and launched a coup against Singhasari. He launched a diversionary attack to the northern Java, where his troops drew the remaining Singhasari troops left in the island. With Singhasari defenseless he attacked the capital city.\n\nKertanegara was killed in his palace. Jayakatwang then declared himself ruler of Java and king of the restored Kediri.\n\nAmong few surviving relatives of Kertanegara was Raden Wijaya, who fled to Madura where he was sheltered by its regent, Arya Wiraraja. Following Wiraraja's plea, Jayakatwang pardoned Wijaya, who in return submitted himself to Jayakatwang. Jayakatwang gave Wijaya land in the Tarik forest in Brantas delta, to build a village that was later called Majapahit, named from the sour beal tree that grow in the area.\n\nMongol expedition of the Yuan dynasty sent by Kublai Khan finally arrived in Java. Sailing from Quanzhou, and after journey from China through Champa and Karimata, landing at the port of Tuban in early 1293. Raden Wijaya seeing this event as opportunity to revenge Kertanegara's death and claim the throne of Java. He soon offered submission and allied himself with the Mongol, who wasn't aware on the recent political change in Java.\n\nThe Mongolian expedition consisted of 20.000 army with 1.000 boats and a year of grain provision. The expedition consisted mostly of southern Chinese conscript. They arrived at port of Tuban and soon preparing their fleet to enter the rivers of Java.\n\nWith Wijaya as guide, Mongol troop declared war against Jayakatwang. Wijaya's and his Mongol allies defeated captured Jayakatwang's navy in Surabaya at delta of Brantas river. Following the victory they easily marched along Brantas to Kediri in Java's interior. After heavy fight, they besieged and conquered Kediri. Jayakatwang was captured and then executed, in March 1293.\n\nThus the troops sent to Java that with the intention to punish the king who insulted the Mongols (Kertanegara), ended up revenging his death and killing his usurper (Jayakatwang).\n\nJayakatwang's restoration of Kediri was short-lived, but the event that happened during his reign played important part in the history of Java and Indonesia, especially in the rise of Majapahit under Raden Wijaya.\n\nIn disguise of returning to his domain in Majapahit to prepare tribute for the Mongol, Raden Wijaya would go on to betray his Mongol allies, who were exhausted after the war with Jayakatwang. He would drive them from Java and establishing Majapahit as the one of the greatest empire that rise from modern territory of Indonesia.\n"}

He shared the latter's love of music and was said to have inherited some important papers and relics of his ancestor. After schooling in Dresden, he enlisted in the German army in 1916, where he served as a cavalry officer. After World War I, he studied at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, and Leipzig, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1922. He taught at Leipzig University. His \"Habilitationsschrift\", entitled \"Religionswissenschaft\", is widely considered a landmark document in the field of the History of Religions.\n\nThough Wach's family had long since converted from Judaism to Christianity, he was nonetheless driven out of his teaching post by the Nazis in the early 1930s. He was able to emigrate to the United States, where he took up a post at Brown University, first as Visiting Professor of Biblical Literature (1935–1939) and then as Associate Professor (1939–1946). Raised as a Lutheran, he became an Episcopalian shortly after coming to the United States. He was granted United States citizenship in 1946.\n\nWach taught at the University of Chicago Divinity School from 1945 to 1955, becoming the chair of the History of Religions area, which had just been moved to the Divinity School from its earlier home in the Division of the Humanities. In his lectures and his writings, he emphasized a comprehensive study of religion, focusing on a) religious experience, b) religious praxis, and c) religious communities.\n\nAccording to the University of Chicago Archives, Wach used the methods of the social sciences to better understand religious thought. Developing the field known as the Sociology of Religion, he maintained that the founder of a new religion experienced a revelation illuminating the way the world worked. He then began to acquire disciples who became a closely knit circle directed towards the founder with whom they each had intimate contact. The solidarity of this relationship bound the disciples together and differentiated them from other forms of social organization. Membership in the group required a break with past life and its everyday pursuits in order to focus on the new knowledge to the extent that ties of family and kinship would be relaxed or severed.\n\nWach died unexpectedly of a heart attack (though he had had a history of heart trouble) on August 27, 1955, in Locarno, Switzerland.\n\n\n"}

This was also the first seed company to advertise directly to the public in \"High Times\" magazine.\n\nBorn in 1957 in Perth, Western Australia to Dutch parents, Schoenmakers moved to the Netherlands in 1976. There he started growing cannabis for personal use. He soon discovered that the commercially available Thai, Colombian and African strains did not perform well in the Netherlands's northern European climate, nor indoors under artificial lighting. Realizing that the solution to the problem was better genetics, he decided that the best way to obtain good genetics was to start a seed bank, and in 1984 Schoenmakers established \"The Seedbank.\" From then on, Schoenmakers collected many potent cannabis strains and crossed them to create his own strains. In the process he was able to cross equatorial sativas with Afghani indicas to create strains that were more suited to the temperate climates and indoor growing mediums of his European and U.S. customers. By 1986, Schoenmakers's cannabis seed company had become a runaway success with sales to more than 15,000 different growers in the United States alone.\n\nIn 1990 Schoenmakers became a target of the DEA Operation Green Merchant and an indictment had been lodged in New Orleans, charging him with the sale of marijuana seeds to undercover agents and indoor growers in the New Orleans area. On July 24, 1990, he was arrested by the Australian authorities at the request of the U.S. government while visiting family in Perth. Schoenmakers was incarcerated in Fremantle jail for almost a year without bail while awaiting his extradition hearing. On June 21, 1991, just weeks before the date of his Federal Court hearing, he was finally granted bail and subsequently disappeared from Australia. For some time after Schoenmakers's return to the Netherlands, he was on the FBI's most wanted list, but because his activities were legal under Dutch law his extradition was refused and the charges were ultimately dropped. In 1991 Schoenmakers sold The Seed Bank to Sensi Seeds where he worked for a short time as their head breeder, before founding the Greenhouse Seed company with Arjan Roskam. By 1998, and widely regarded as the most successful modern cannabis breeder with multiple High Times Cannabis Cup wins, Schoenmakers sold his share of Greenhouse Seeds and left the limelight to focus on other interests.\n\nIn recent years, Schoenmakers has become involved in the movement to legalise medicinal cannabis in Australia. He recently coauthored a submission to a NSW government inquiry into the matter.\n\nSchoenmakers was described by \"High Times\" magazine in 1985 as the \"King of Cannabis.\" he was the first cannabis breeder to export cannabis seeds from the Netherlands to the rest of the world, and is credited with creating many of the most popular award winning strains, such as Nevil's Haze, Northern Lights Haze, Super Silver Haze, Nevil's Skunk, Super Skunk, Silver Pearl, Silver Haze and many others. His breeding with Northern Lights, a mostly Indica strain originally developed in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, became an inspiration for indoor Indicas, and the Northern Lights genetics are found in the pedigrees of nearly all of the best modern Indica lines. He is best remembered for the F1 hybrid Northern Lights 5 X Haze. This hybrid and its daughters have dominated the Cannabis Cup from the 1980s to the present day. The original Northern Lights 5 X Haze plant of Nevil's has been living on through clones and still wins championship awards. It is this cross that led to many of the modern medicinal strains that are popular today.\n\n"}

The seventh generation of her family in Israel, Back returned there for good in 1980. She currently resides in the Galilee, in the north of the country. Back studied at Yale University, Temple University, and received her PhD from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nCurrently a senior lecturer of English literature at Oranim Academic College, Israel, Back was appointed Brownstone Visiting Associate Professor at Dartmouth College in the US in 2009.

From 1995-2000, Back was the Israeli Academic and Administrative Director of the Wesleyan and Brown Universities Overseas Program in Israeli and Palestinian Studies, based in Jerusalem.\n\nBack's most recent poetry collection, \"A Messenger Comes\" (2012), is described by the poet Irena Klepfisz as \"poetry that, without apology, centers on grief and its faithful companion, memory\"; according to poet Hank Lazer, this collection is \"a harrowing & inspiring book of poems.\" Among her previous poetry collections is \"Litany\" (1995), \"Azimuth\" (2001), \"The Buffalo Poems\" (2003), and \"On Ruins & Return: Poems 1999-2005\" (2005).\n\nIn 1996, Back was awarded the Israeli Absorption Minister's Prize for Immigrant Writers for her poetry collection \"Azimuth\", which was then translated into Hebrew by Israeli poet Aharon Shabtai (published by Kibbutz HaMeuchad, 2000). Poet Peter Cole noted of \"Azimuth\" that \"with grace and gravity, with a gentle, quiet tenacity, Rachel Tzvia Back brings the poetics of indeterminacy to bear on Israel's over-determined landscape. Her verse hurts as the land itself has been hurt: its rippling music is delicate and achieved, its evocation of intimacy stunning.\" Back's subsequent poetry collections \"The Buffalo Poems\" and \"On Ruins & Return\" track the cycle of violence marking the lives of Palestinians and Israelis. Poet Andrew Mossin noted that \"with its passionate interrogation and representation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, [Back's] work has its basis in personal, observed experience of a conflict that appears to be without end.\" Mossin also observed that Back's \"On Ruins & Return\" \"continues the journey of her earlier volume, \"Azimuth\", to inscribe in a poetry of psalmic intensity and astringent care the geographic, political and po-ethical realities of present-day Israel.\"\n\nBack's poetry has appeared in numerous literary journals including \"The American Poetry Review\", \"Sulfur\", \"Bridges\", \"Tikkun\" and \"Modern Poetry in Translation\", and in several anthologies including the SUNY Press anthology \"Dreaming the Actual: Contemporary Fiction and Poetry by Israeli Women Writers\".

{"id": "375137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375137", "title": "Rashad Khalifa", "text": "Rashad Khalifa\n\nRashad Khalifa (; November 19, 1935 – January 30, 1990) was an Egyptian-American biochemist, closely associated with the United Submitters International (USI), an offshoot reform Islamic group. His teachings, some of which depended on numerological analysis of the Quran, were opposed by Traditionalist Muslims. He was assassinated on January 31, 1990. \n\nKhalifa was born in Egypt on November 19, 1935. He obtained an honors degree from Ain Shams University, Egypt, before he emigrated to the United States in 1959. He later earned a Master's Degree in biochemistry from Arizona State University and a Ph.D. from University of California. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen and lived in Tucson, Arizona. He was married to an American woman and they had a son and a daughter together.\n\nKhalifa worked as a science adviser for the Libyan government for about one year, after which he worked as a chemist for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. He next worked as a senior chemist in Arizona's State Office of Chemistry in 1980.\n\nHe was central to the founding of the USI.\n\nKhalifa said that he was a messenger of God but not a prophet, and that the archangel Gabriel \"most assertively\" told him that chapter 36, verse 3, of the Quran, \"specifically\" referred to him. He coined the phrase \"Final Testament\" in reference to the Quran, with his followers referring to him as \"God's Messenger of the Covenant\". Some Muslims objected to his interpretations, based on his claim that parts of the Quran were fabricated; precluding him from being a strict Quranist. \n\nIn his works, Khalifa claimed that the Quran contains a mathematical structure based on the number 19. Starting in 1968, Khalifa used computers to analyze the frequency of letters and words in the Quran, with his first book on the topic appearing in 1973.\n\nKhalifa's research did not receive much attention in the West. In 1980, Martin Gardner mentioned it in \"Scientific American\". Gardner later wrote a more extensive and critical review of Khalifa and his work.\n\nKhalifa's first published report in the Arab world appeared in the Egyptian magazine \"Akher Sa'a\", in January 1973. Updates of his research were subsequently published by the same magazine later that year and again in 1975.\n\nIn October 1979, Khalifa was accused in Tucson of sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual contact with a minor. The accuser, a 16-year-old-girl, testified at a hearing that Khalifa sexually molested her while supposedly recruiting her for a \"United Nations\" research project on the human aura. There was no physical evidence of intercourse found when the girl was examined at a local hospital, although Khalifa admitted to police that he had manipulated the girl's breast during his research. Justice of the Peace James P. West ruled there was probable cause to hold Khalifa for trial on the charges, due to his admission and \"the circumstances under which Khalifa obtained the office\".\n\nOn January 31, 1990, Khalifa was found stabbed to death inside the Masjid (Mosque) of Tucson Arizona, his place of employment. He was stabbed multiple times. \n\nNineteen years after the murder, on April 28, 2009, the Calgary Police Services of Canada arrested Glen Cusford Francis, a 52-year-old citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, on suspicion of killing Rashad Khalifa. Investigators in Tucson learned that Francis, who was going by the name Benjamin Phillips, had begun his studies under Khalifa in January 1990. Phillips disappeared shortly after the slaying, and was said to have left the country. An investigation revealed Phillips and Francis were the same man when the police analyzed fingerprints found in Phillips' apartment. A specialty unit of the Tucson Police Department progressed in its investigation in 2006 and in December 2008, and was able to use DNA testing on forensic evidence from the crime scene to tie Francis to the assassination. In October 2009, a Canadian judge ordered Francis's extradition to the United States to face trial. \n\nThe trial for the murder began on December 11, 2012. On December 19, the jury, after a three-hour deliberation, found Glen Francis guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life in prison.\n\nPrior to the Francis trial, James Williams, an alleged member of the Jamaat ul-Fuqra organization, was convicted of conspiracy in the slaying. Williams disappeared on the day of his sentencing and could not be found. In 2000 Williams was apprehended attempting to re-enter the United States. and sentenced to serve 69 years in prison. His convictions were upheld on appeal by the Colorado Court of Appeals except for one count of forgery.\n\nCBS News reported that Muslim extremist Wadih el-Hage was \"connected to the 1990 stabbing death... El-Hage, who was indicted for lying about the case, called the assassination 'a good thing.'\" If he was involved, Khalifa would be possibly the first American to be killed by an operative of Al Qaeda in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3652202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3652202", "title": "Shaq–Kobe feud", "text": "Shaq–Kobe feud\n\nThe \"Kobe-Shaq feud\" (or \"Shaq-Kobe feud\") was the conflict between National Basketball Association (NBA) players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, who played together on the Los Angeles Lakers team from 1996 to 2004.\n\nThe two were able to win three consecutive NBA Championships (2000, 2001, 2002) and make an NBA Finals appearance in 2004. O'Neal was the NBA Finals MVP in each of their victories. Personal differences and arguments over their respective roles on the Lakers were followed by a trade that sent O'Neal to the Miami Heat while Bryant was re-signed as a free agent by the Lakers. Lakers head coach Phil Jackson would later write a book entitled \"\", reflecting on the troubles Bryant and O'Neal had during their last season together.\n\nIn 1996, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired the draft rights to high school player Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets by trading established center Vlade Divac. No NBA team had previously drafted a guard straight from high school. After freeing up salary by parting with other veteran players, they signed free agent All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal later that year. The two sparred in their first three seasons playing together from 1996–1999. Bryant kept his teammates at a distance, answering non-basketball questions with one- or two-word responses. O'Neal told the Lakers when Bryant arrived, \"I'm not gonna be babysitting.\" Bryant had extreme confidence in his ability, which was unusual for an 18-year-old. Some teammates interpreted Bryant's confidence as arrogance. O'Neal was wary of Bryant, as a rookie, boasting that he would lead the Lakers in scoring and be the best player in the league. Lakers general manager Jerry West criticized O'Neal's leadership for hazing Bryant that season. While O'Neal's personality was good-humored, Bryant's demeanor was all-business and was interpreted by some teammates as selfishness. O'Neal began calling Bryant \"showboat\" because of his flashy offensive moves. In an overtime playoff loss to the Utah Jazz that eliminated the Lakers, O'Neal fouled out with two minutes remaining in regulation. Lakers coach Del Harris had designed the Laker offense around the rookie Bryant, who went on to shoot four air balls. Harris explained that Bryant's one-on-one skills made him the best choice. After the game, O'Neal put his arm around Bryant and told him there would be other opportunities. West said the team's shortcoming made O'Neal angry since he was going to be judged by the team's success.\n\nBryant was assigned by the Lakers to play in the 1997 NBA Summer League to improve as a team player and learn where to send the ball when he drew double teams. The following season, Bryant was voted as a starter in the 1998 All-Star Game though he was a reserve on the Lakers. The Lakers struggled after the All-Star break, losing seven of their first 12 games, and Bryant had a stretch where he made only 30 of 100 shots. O'Neal wanted a championship immediately, and he did not want to wait for Bryant to mature as a player. Harris thought the NBA and its television broadcaster, National Broadcasting Company (NBC), were overexposing Bryant and that he became more of a one-on-one player after the break. Bryant's playing time became reduced. The Lakers were eliminated in the 1998 playoffs in the conference finals after they were swept by the Jazz, 4–0.\n\nThe team's lockout-shortened 50-game 1998–99 season included a brief stint as a player by Dennis Rodman, the firing of head coach Harris, and the interim head coaching stint of former Laker player Kurt Rambis. During the lockout, O'Neal, Bryant, Derek Fisher, and Corie Blount played a two-on-two basketball game. Bryant was always a physical player during practice. Other players, though, disliked Bryant's approach to practice. Fisher said, \"That was really the way we all should have been playing. With Kobe's spirit.\" During the game, O'Neal slapped Bryant. Fisher said neither O'Neal nor Bryant really started it, as they were both being physical. During the season, the team would blame their problems on what they felt was Bryant's selfish play. At one point, O'Neal pointed at Bryant and told reporters in the locker room, \"There's the problem.\" Bryant's jerseys were outselling O'Neal's in Southern California sporting goods stores, and rumors started that O'Neal was jealous, as he was with Penny Hardaway when they played together in Orlando. \"That's far from the truth\", said Fisher. \"All Shaq wants to do is win.\" Asked if he helped Bryant through his growing pains, O'Neal said \"I try not to help guys out too much. Experience is the best teacher ... Kobe's a great player ... He's a new, up-and-coming kid.\" O'Neal thought Rambis favored Bryant. Rambis asked O'Neal, the veteran team leader, to heal the rift and reach out to Bryant. Rambis said O'Neal gave him a \"blank, cold stare.\" The rift between O'Neal and Bryant continued into the playoffs. While the Lakers defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round of that year's NBA Playoffs, they were ultimately swept 4–0 by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round.\n\nDuring the 1999 offseason, West and Lakers owner Jerry Buss agreed to sign the then six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson to a high-priced, 5-year $30 million contract to be the team's new head coach entering the 1999–2000 season. Buss was previously a believer in spending conservatively on coaches, but O'Neal and Bryant had both encouraged West to hire Jackson. Jackson decided that the offense would revolve around O'Neal, who would be given responsibility to distribute the ball. Jackson also wanted better leadership, physical conditioning, and defense from O'Neal. The coach chose to develop a close relationship with O'Neal and not Bryant. Jackson calculated that O'Neal's personality craved such a relationship. Bryant missed the season's first 15 games due to a broken right wrist, allowing the team to focus on O'Neal as Jackson had planned. The results of Jackson's hiring were promising, as the Lakers amassed a 67–15 record (one of the best records in league history). O'Neal led the league in scoring, averaging 29.7 points per game, and he won his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award. During the playoffs, the Lakers fought off the eighth-seeded Sacramento Kings in five games, and then defeated the Phoenix Suns in the second round, four games to one.\n\nIt was in the 2000 Western Conference Finals that a defining moment of O'Neal's and Bryant's on-court success together occurred. The Lakers had led the Portland Trail Blazers three games to one, before dropping Game 5 at home and Game 6 in Portland. The Blazers were leading the decisive Game 7, putting the Lakers on the brink of elimination. Portland led by 15 points early in the fourth quarter, before the Lakers mounted a 25–4 rally to take the lead. The comeback run culminated as Bryant drove the lane and threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal for a one-handed slam dunk after which O'Neal ran upcourt with his mouth agape and both index fingers waving. Bryant extended his hand to O'Neal for a high five, but O'Neal in his celebration did not notice.\nThe Lakers won the game 89–84, and the 13 point comeback after three quarters was the most ever in a Game 7 in the NBA playoffs. O'Neal had 18 points and 9 rebounds, and Bryant had 25 points, 11 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 blocked shots. The two players complimented each other on the alley-oop play after the game, and assistant coach Tex Winter thought they came to respect each other. The Lakers went on to defeat the Indiana Pacers in six games and won their first NBA championship since 1988. The Lakers led the series 2–0 behind O'Neal's dominating presence. The Lakers lost Game 3, which Bryant missed with an ankle injury. After O'Neal fouled out in overtime of Game 4, Jackson spread the floor and had Bryant take over the offense and lead the team to victory. Leading 110–109 with 1:32 remaining in Game 6, Jackson again spread the offense—even with O'Neal on the floor—and again allowed Bryant to take over; the Lakers won the game, 116–111, and won the championship. In the ensuing celebration, Bryant was the first person to embrace O'Neal.\n\nThe season was not without confrontation, as O'Neal in one team meeting said, \"I have something to say. I think Kobe is playing too selfishly for us to win.\" O'Neal felt pressure to be leader of the team and was upset with Bryant's shot selection. Teammate Ron Harper helped mediate the differences between O'Neal and Bryant. According to Jackson, \"Kobe didn't have a selfish agenda; he just felt that the way he had been playing was the best way he could contribute. Gradually, he's seen there is a different way to contribute that incorporates more of the team.\" Upon arriving to the Lakers that season, Winter said he was stunned to discover the level of hatred O'Neal expressed toward Bryant. \"There was a lot of hatred in [O'Neal's] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going.\" O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant made it a point to get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him. During that season's All-Star Game, Bryant did not participate in the Slam Dunk Contest and a matchup against Vince Carter, following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's crossover dribble but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an inside joke between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the triangle offense to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.\n\nIn 2001, the Lakers won the title again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into training camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason to improve his game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range. O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, \"When it was clear that everything went through me, the outcome of it was (a record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade. And now we're 23–11. You figure it out ... I don't know why anybody else would want to change – other than selfish reasons.\" Bryant responded that it was a different year and the roster had undergone some changes and \"things change, things evolve, and you just have to grow with that change.\" Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka said a key factor was the team's defense after losing Fisher for most of the season. O'Neal requested a trade after a blowout win against the Phoenix Suns where Bryant scored 38 and O'Neal scored 18. Jackson commented that their actions were \"juvenile\" and they should appreciate each other and play as a team. Bryant would be criticized for forcing his offense and not involving his teammates enough. Even O'Neal's stepfather was overheard yelling at Bryant to pass the ball during a game. Bryant told Jackson that the \"(triangle) offense is so simple. It doesn't display my talent ... it doesn't give me what I have to have for my game.\" According to Bryant, the team's defense was the issue and not his increased role in the offense. Bryant said that \"scoring shouldn't affect (O'Neal's) defense\", while O'Neal maintained that \"if the big dog ain't me, then the house won't get guarded – period.\" Due to O'Neal's sensitivity toward criticism, Jackson overlooked O'Neal's shortcomings while maintaining his criticism of Bryant. West told O'Neal that he also had personal rivalries when he played with all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor, but O'Neal needed to \"stop being a baby ... put the team's success first.\"\n\nMagic Johnson later noticed a change in O'Neal: \"Shaq is saying 'It's me. I'm the one who has to get into shape, I'm the one who has to be ready for the second half run. I'm the one who has to close the middle down like I did last year.' ... He's not blaming everybody else.\" Fisher returned on March 13, upgrading the team's defense. The Lakers won their last eight games to finish the regular season with 56 wins. O'Neal averaged 33.7 points over the final 11 games. Bryant, upon returning from an injury, was willing to build off of O'Neal now that the center was in shape and playing defense. Bryant would play unselfishly in the playoffs. O'Neal referred to Bryant as \"[his] idol\" and \"the best player in the league, by far\" following a victory in Game 1 of that year's Western Conference Finals. The Lakers won the championship after a then-historic 15-1 postseason record. After the lone loss, which was in the opening game of the NBA Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers, Jackson criticized O'Neal for his lack of defense. Before the following game, Lakers coach Phil Jackson growled at O'Neal, \"Don't be afraid to block a shot!\" after O'Neal failed to block a shot in Game 1. O'Neal finished Game 2 with 28 points, 20 rebounds, 9 assists and 8 blocks.\n\nNot much was made publicly about the feud in the 2001-02 season as the team was set back by injuries, personal tragedies, and national news. O'Neal missed training camp due to surgery on an arthritic toe. He opted against a more involved surgery to return back quicker. Still, his toe bothered him throughout the season. Jackson also missed most of camp due to the death of his 94-year-old mother, and Bryant returned to Philadelphia to bury his grandfather. Combined with the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, O'Neal said it would be hard for basketball players to be divided by pettiness.\n\nDespite the rocky season, The Lakers won their third consecutive championship, defeating the New Jersey Nets, 4–0. It was the Lakers' first championship sweep in their history, and O'Neal won his third consecutive NBA Finals MVP. Bryant and O'Neal were complimentary of each other afterwards.\n\nThe 2002–03 season began with the three-time defending champions getting off to one of their worst starts ever. The team was several games under .500 at 11–19 with their return to the playoffs questionable. O'Neal was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe. O'Neal could have had surgery on his toe early in the summer (which would have allowed him to return to playing sooner), but he decided to wait and have the surgery performed not long before the Lakers' pre-season training camp began. He said, \"I got hurt on company time, so I’ll rehab on company time.\" O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure. During the season, Bryant had a nine-game streak where he scored at least 40 points and a 13-game streak where he scored 35 or better. Still, the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant remained peaceful. Jackson had ordered Bryant to be more aggressive. The Lakers ended that season with the 5th seed in the Western Conference, failing to get home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. They defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in six games, but were eliminated by eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals.\n\nThe subsequent off-season included accusations and then charges of rape by Bryant in Colorado. On July 16, a little more than two weeks after the initial assault allegations, the Lakers announced the signings of veteran free agents and former All-Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton, who were recruited by O'Neal. After the signings, the Lakers were widely considered the favorite to win the NBA title. However, even with these additions, the Lakers would not be able to avoid controversy.\n\nO'Neal said his and Bryant's past barbs in the press was \"almost like a game.\" They could handle it—until the 2003–04 season. Just prior to the season, Bryant privately warned Jackson, \"If [O'Neal] starts saying [unreasonable] things in the press, I'll fire back ... I've had it.\" There had been no public indications of animosity between the two since the 2000–2001 season. With Bryant absent from camp due to his legal situation and his recovery from knee surgery, O'Neal said \"the full team is here.\" Later, after sitting out an exhibition game to rest a sore left heel, O'Neal said, \"I want to be right [in the regular season] for Derek [Fisher], Karl and Gary.\" Bryant was again ignored by O'Neal.\n\nWhen Bryant joined the Lakers in camp, O'Neal told reporters Bryant should look to be more of a passer than a scorer until Bryant's knee was fully healed. Bryant responded that he knew how to play the guard position, and O'Neal should worry about the low post. O'Neal responded, \"Just ask Karl and Gary why they came here. One person. Not two. One. Period.\" O'Neal agreed that Bryant could handle playing guard, but Bryant needed advice on how to play team ball. O'Neal added that he would voice his opinions as he saw fit because the Lakers were his team. He said that if Bryant, who would be a free agent at the season's end, didn't like what O'Neal had to say, Bryant should just opt out since O'Neal said \"I ain't going nowhere.\" Jackson told the team to not discuss the issue further with reporters.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with Jim Gray of ESPN, Bryant questioned O'Neal's claims of team leadership. Bryant claimed that O'Neal came into training camp \"fat and out of shape\", that O'Neal blamed others for the team's defeats, and that O'Neal previously exaggerated the degree to which injuries had affected his game as a cover for simply being out of condition. Bryant criticized O'Neal's public lobbying for a contract extension when \"we have two future Hall of Famers (Malone and Payton) playing here pretty much for free\". He also criticized O'Neal for only taking responsibility when the team won. He accused O'Neal of threatening not to put forth his best effort if he was not passed the ball more often. Bryant was also upset that O'Neal did not personally contact him amidst his legal troubles in the summer. O'Neal had his bodyguard, Jerome Crawford, call Bryant. \"Everyone knows Jerome is me\", said O'Neal.\nThe following day, Lakers scout and former teammate Brian Shaw mediated between a furious O'Neal and Bryant. Shaw reprimanded O'Neal for yelling \"Pay me\" at Buss after dunking during a preseason game. Shaw turned to Bryant and told him that Jackson allowed O'Neal time to recover from the physical pounding he endured every season. Bryant, still disappointed at the support he received over the summer, told O'Neal, \"You're supposed to be my friend.\" Shaw questioned why he would believe that when Bryant did not join the team for dinners on the road, failed to attend O'Neal's wedding though invited, and did not invite a single teammate to his own wedding.\n\nJackson fined Bryant an undisclosed amount for defying his orders to not talk to the press. O'Neal would reveal after the season that he promised Malone and Payton he would cease feuding with Bryant in light of his legal situation with the rape charge. On opening night of the season, an injured Bryant sat down next to O'Neal during the Lakers' victory over the Dallas Mavericks. \"We put it behind us\", Bryant said. \"Shaq and I are going to move on, be teammates and help this team to a fourth title.\"\n\nThe Lakers started the season with a 21–3 record, and they received accolades as the greatest NBA team ever. However, the Lakers lost Malone for three months to a knee injury during the winter. During the All-Star break, Buss suspended contract negotiations with Jackson, who was seeking to double his salary from $6 million to $12 million on his expiring contract. Jackson had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it. The Lakers also suspended talks with O'Neal, who wanted an extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. The \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that both of the Lakers moves were a concession to Bryant. The Lakers slid towards mediocrity during the spring. Injuries hampered Los Angeles, keeping them as the fourth seed in the Western Conference midway through the season. The team never came together defensively. Winter said, \"Even though Shaq was a big presence, he was not a great shot blocker. And he didn't like to play the screen and roll, so he put his teammates in jeopardy. He didn't like to help [on defense].\" In March, after Bryant received internal criticism about his shot selection, he scored just one point while taking three shots in the first half against Orlando which the Lakers trailed by 11. He scored 37 in the second half and tied a team record with 24 in the fourth quarter as the Lakers won in overtime. Against Sacramento in April, Bryant took just one shot in the first half against tight defense. He finished the game with eight points. An anonymous teammate told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"I don't know how we can forgive him.\" Afterward, Jackson urged Bryant to be more aggressive offensively.\n\nThe Lakers ultimately entered the playoffs as the second seed, thanks to an overtime victory versus the Portland Trail Blazers on the final night of the season, courtesy of a pair of buzzer beaters from Bryant. They defeated the Houston Rockets, the San Antonio Spurs, and the Minnesota Timberwolves before advancing to the 2004 NBA Finals, where they were considered a favorite to defeat the Detroit Pistons. However, after five games, the Lakers found themselves not only defeated but dominated by the Pistons, who won the NBA title. Winter said, \"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding.\"\n\nAfter the loss, the division between O'Neal and Bryant came to a head. At the news conference after the final game, O'Neal addressed the uncertainty around Coach Phil Jackson's now-expired contract, and Bryant's impending free agency, which meant either or both might not return to the Lakers the next season. With regard to the issue of people possibly leaving the team, O'Neal commented that he understood that everyone would need to do what was best for themselves, then adding \"including me\".\n\nEventually Jackson, a favorite of O'Neal, was not offered a new contract by the Lakers. Many sports analysts and spectators assumed that this was because of Bryant, who had at times voiced displeasure with Jackson's offensive scheme. However, Winter said Jackson announced at the All-Star break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned. Buss also longed for the Lakers to return to the fast break offense of Showtime. After learning of Jackson's departure and hearing Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak say he would consider trading him, O'Neal demanded to be traded. He made it clear that he felt the Laker organization was making moves designed primarily to placate Bryant, saying \"The direction they’re going ... I don’t want to be a part of this.\" Bryant, meanwhile, was involved in discussions with the Los Angeles Clippers. O'Neal's demand was soon indulged, as he was sent to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant and a first-round draft pick. NBA coach and former player Doc Rivers called the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant the \"biggest travesty in sports\" because they should have remained teammates and won at least five championships together.\n\nA day after O'Neal was traded, Bryant re-signed with the Lakers for seven years and $136 million. Bryant said he enjoyed playing with both Jackson and O'Neal, and he said he did not influence the Lakers' decisions regarding the two. Regardless, newspapers the next day criticized Bryant for his alleged manipulation of the team. O'Neal added, \"When it came to my leaving, [Kobe] could have spoken up. He could have said something. He didn't say anything.\" Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"\n\nLater, news came out that Bryant had referred to O'Neal while being questioned by police in 2003. According to reports, Bryant stated that he should have paid off his women so that they wouldn't say anything, like O'Neal. Bryant also stated that O'Neal would pay women up to US$1 million to stay quiet about their rendezvous. It also was reported that investigators had told O'Neal of Bryant's supposed statements shortly after the investigation had begun. O'Neal denied these claims, stating that Bryant had no idea about O'Neal's personal business since the two of them rarely spent any time together. O'Neal went as far as to say that he \"[wasn't] the one buying love, [Bryant was] the one buying love\", a reference to Bryant's purchase of a multi-million dollar diamond ring for his wife in the aftermath of the revelation that Bryant had been unfaithful to her.\n\nIn August 2004, the NBA scheduled the Lakers and the Heat to play on Christmas Day. The game registered the NBA's highest regular season television ratings since 1998 and would hold its spot until a 2008 Christmas Day meeting between the Lakers and the Boston Celtics. In the lead-up to the game, O'Neal referred to Bryant as a \"Corvette\" and himself as a \"brick wall\" in an interview with ABC's Al Michaels during halftime of \"Monday Night Football\".\n\nBefore the opening tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet each other by bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the contacts were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, \"I knew there was a lot of talk about the brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now.\" O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying \"I'm over it. It's old news to me.\" Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the NBA All-Star Game and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.\n\nIn the following season, Bryant and O'Neal did not engage in further public attacks. However, hard feelings were apparently still present when they refused to refer to each other by name while talking to the media. The Lakers and the Heat faced off again on Christmas Day in 2005, with the Heat winning the second time. Unlike last year, Bryant and O'Neal did not shake hands nor make eye contact with each other before and after the game. O'Neal said, \"It was just another game to me.\" Bryant said \"I wasn't even thinking about it. It is what it is.\"\n\nPrior to their January 16, 2006 meeting, O'Neal greeted Bryant on the court warmly, a departure from his previous attitude toward Bryant. The two shook hands and hugged before tip-off. After Bryant scored 81 points in a single game against the Toronto Raptors, O'Neal refused to comment to the media about it. O'Neal broke his silence a few weeks later during a media session at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, when he acknowledged that he had watched Bryant's 81-point game and offered praise for the performance. During the All-Star Game itself, the two were seen laughing and joking together. O'Neal and the Heat won the NBA title that season. In his 2011 autobiography, \"Shaq Uncut: My Story\", O'Neal wrote of the championship, \"I had proven I could win anywhere—not just with some shot-happy guard in Los Angeles.\"\n\nO'Neal indirectly referenced the feud in his cameo appearance in the 2006 movie \"Scary Movie 4\". O'Neal is kidnapped in the movie in a \"Saw\" parody, and he hears a frightening voice. A terrified O'Neal then asks, \"Kobe?\"\n\nIn 2007, O'Neal said that Bryant should have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, which was awarded to Dirk Nowitzki. During the offseason, Bryant was \"beyond furious\" at reports from a Laker insider that Bryant had insisted O'Neal be traded from the Lakers. Bryant reported that Buss said, \"I am not going to re-sign Shaq. I am not about to pay him $30 million a year or $80 million over three years ... His body is breaking down, and I don't want to pay that money to him when I can get value for him right now rather than wait ... It doesn't matter to me what you do in free agency because I do not want to pay [Shaq], period.\" O'Neal agreed with Bryant: \"There's no doubt in my mind Kobe is telling the truth. I believe him a thousand percent ... I would have respected Dr. Buss more as a man if he would have told me that himself, because I know he said it.\"\n\nIn 2008, O'Neal reiterated his belief that Bryant deserved the MVP award. Bryant went on to win the award for the first time in his career that season. During the offseason, O'Neal was at a party, and got up to rap in front of the crowd. O'Neal mentioned Bryant multiple times in the rap, saying that \"Kobe couldn't do it without me\", referring to Bryant and the Lakers loss in the 2008 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics. He also rapped, \"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\". During the rap, O'Neal also blamed his divorce on Bryant's comments to investigators in 2004 about O'Neal paying off women. Bryant commented that he \"didn't take (O'Neal's rap) any kind of way whatsoever.\" O'Neal later said he was freestyling and that \"it was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever ... I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\" Rap artist Snoop Dogg, a Laker fan, agreed that \"Shaq has all access and the right to do and say what he wants to say in fun, in the spirit of rap.\"\n\nIn November of the 2008–2009 season, O'Neal told reporters that he believed the entire feud has been the fault of the Lakers head coach Phil Jackson. O'Neal later retracted the statement and apologized, interrupting one of Jackson's pre-game interviews to give him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. On January 29, 2009, in an interview with Stephen A. Smith, O'Neal claimed that the feud between him and Bryant was simply a marketing ploy, saying \"We helped you hype it up. I know what I'm doing, brother. I'm the smartest player in the world.\" On Bryant, O'Neal claimed that he \"always did love Kobe.\" On Jackson, O'Neal claimed he is \"the greatest coach ever. And he's done a lot for me. Phil's my guy. It's all marketing, baby.\" O'Neal also added that had he stayed with the Lakers, he and Bryant would have won another three or four titles. \"We're still the greatest little-man, big-man 1-2 punch ever created in the history of the game\", O'Neal said. At the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, O'Neal, Bryant, and Jackson were all reunited on the West squad. O'Neal and Bryant were both named co-MVPs for the game and were shown laughing and hugging during the game. O'Neal told Bryant to keep the MVP trophy, but Bryant instead gave it to O'Neal's son. For O'Neal, Bryant's gesture marked a turning point in their relationship. Bryant and the Lakers would go to face the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals. Shaq showed support for Kobe, on his Twitter page saying: \"thats right i am saying it today and today only, i want kobe bryant to get number 4, spread da word \".\n\nAfter the Lakers once again won the title in Game 7 of the 2010 Finals, Bryant was asked what it meant to him personally. He responded, \"Just one more than Shaq ... I can take that to the bank.\" Bryant had won five NBA titles, and O'Neal had won four. Bryant added, \"You guys know how I am. I don't forget anything.\" O'Neal again congratulated Bryant on his Twitter page: \"Congratulations Kobe, u deserve it. U played great. Enjoy it man enjoy it. I know what ur sayin 'Shaq how my ass taste' .\"\n\nUpon hearing Bryant's comment about having more titles than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Boston Celtics, said to Danny Ainge, Celtics' president, \"Let's go get Shaq.\" O'Neal signed a two-year contract with the Celtics for the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 season for the league minimum of $1.3 million and adding to the Celtics–Lakers rivalry. Bill Simmons of ESPN speculated that O'Neal wanted to tie Bryant with five titles and that still \"Shaq hates Kobe and Kobe hates Shaq.\" O'Neal said he didn't \"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night – like D-Wade, Kobe.\" O'Neal added that he is only competing against Tim Duncan: \"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\" Kobe and Shaq would play each other one last time on January 30, 2011, with Shaq's Celtics prevailing over the Kobe's Lakers in a 109–96 victory. However, O'Neal was held scoreless, as he was now relegated to a role player. The teams would face again a week and a half later, but O'Neal would not play as he was dealing with an injury.\n\nO'Neal announced his retirement via social media on June 1, 2011. Two days later, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement. When asked who was the greatest player he ever played with during his career, O'Neal did not answer but Bryant was the only player whose name was mentioned. He also mentioned that his departure from Los Angeles has nothing to do with Kobe Bryant, saying \"the reason I left wasn't about what Kobe did; it was about something else. I was making maximum dollars and felt I deserved more. It was a business end.\" When asked whether leaving Los Angeles was a bad decision, he answered \"I don't like to live in a world of ifs. But if we would have stayed, possibly we could have got six [championships].\"\n\nAfter his retirement, O'Neal was hired by Turner Sports as an NBA analyst. When asked whether it would be difficult for him to criticize Bryant, he answered \"I have the ability and the backing to give fair criticism. The only time I have trouble with people giving criticism is when they haven't walked that walk. I've walked many walks in my 19-year career, so I think any criticism that I give should be fair.\" During the 2011 NBA lockout, Bryant discussed his problems with O'Neal with a radio station in Italy, saying \"I like players who workout. I used to do that 6–7 hours per day. I cannot stand players who practice for 30 minutes.\" O'Neal countered that he did not need to work out, and that \"My three Finals MVPs speaks for itself.\"\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Bryant passed O'Neal for fifth place on the all-time scoring list. Bryant said it was an honor because of their championships together. O'Neal congratulated Bryant, saying \"I'm proud of him. I'm happy for him. And, most of all, I want to thank him for being a part of the greatest 1-2 punch ever created, never to be duplicated.\" Bryant stated on radio the following day that he and O'Neal were never going to last as teammates. Bryant recalled: \"There was an interview that I heard Shaq do which he kind of threw down the challenge of me not being able to win without him. After I read that, I said, 'Aw, that's it.' Some comparison that he made with me and Penny Hardaway, and once I read that, I said, 'You know what? I can't finish my career with people saying that. There's no way.'\" In 2013, Bryant said that the two \"have a really, really good relationship now\", calling it \"a good lesson for all of us.\" He said the two had \"mutual respect\" for each other, while O'Neal commented that they had an \"athletic dislike\" for each other but \"never had a real dislike\". That year, the Lakers retired O'Neal's No. 34 during a halftime ceremony. Bryant did not attend the ceremony, but called O'Neal \"the most gifted physical specimen I've ever seen play this game\" in a recorded video during the event. Questioned about his absence, Bryant told the media, \"I appreciate you guys trying to start some stuff for old times' sake.\" Later, it came out that Bryant had missed the ceremony because he had been receiving treatment from the Lakers' training staff.\n\nIn 2015, O'Neal would launch \"The Big Podcast\" with Bryant as his first guest. O'Neal would introduce Bryant as \"the greatest Laker ever\" as the two reflected on their feud.\n\nBryant retired following the 2015–16 NBA season, playing his final game on April 13, 2016. Leading the Lakers to a come-from-behind 101–96 victory against the Utah Jazz with 60 points, Bryant outscored the entire Jazz team 23–21 in the fourth quarter. He was then taken off the floor with 4.1 second remaining, to an uproarious Staples Center crowd. O'Neal, who was in attendance, was the first person that Bryant embraced upon returning to the bench. When asked about Kobe's legacy during a segment on TNT, Shaq repeated his praise of Bryant as \"the greatest Laker ever.\"\n\nOne year later, O'Neal was honored by the Lakers with a statue of his likeness outside Staples Center. Bryant was in attendance of the statue's unveiling and spoke at the event, which O'Neal said \"meant a lot\" to him. Addressing Kobe during the ceremony, O'Neal said, \"Next time we're out here for a statue, it'll probably be your statue.\"\n\nIn February 2018, both players recorded a 'Players Only' special for NBATV where they spoke about their history together, the mutual respect and appreciation, and explanations and regrets over the tensions and feud.\n\nO'Neal was 7–4 all-time against Bryant, though Bryant outscored O'Neal in each meeting.\n\n"}
{"id": "25664190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25664190", "title": "Socrates", "text": "Socrates\n\nSocrates (; , ; – 399 BC) was a classical Greek (Athenian) philosopher credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being the first moral philosopher, of the Western ethical tradition of thought.\nAn enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the only source to have written during his lifetime.\n\nPlato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, though it is unclear the degree to which Socrates himself is \"hidden behind his 'best disciple. Through his portrayal in Plato's dialogues, Socrates has become renowned for his contribution to the fields of ethics and epistemology. It is this who lends his name to the concepts of Socratic irony and the Socratic method, or \"elenchus.\"\n\nSocrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and in the modern era. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature and popular culture have made him one of the most widely known figures in the Western philosophical tradition.\n\nAs Socrates did not write down any of his teachings, secondary sources provide the only information on his life and thought. The sometimes contradictory nature of these sources is known as the \"Socratic problem\", or \"the Socratic question\".\n\nPlato and Xenophon's dialogues provide the main source of information on Socrates' life and thought. These writings are the \"Sokratikoi logoi\", or Socratic dialogues, which consist of reports of conversations apparently involving Socrates.\n\nAs for discovering the real-life Socrates, the difficulty is that ancient sources are mostly philosophical or dramatic texts, apart from Xenophon. There are no straightforward histories, contemporary with Socrates, that dealt with his own time and place. A corollary of this is that sources that do mention Socrates do not necessarily claim to be historically accurate, and are often partisan. For instance, those who prosecuted and convicted Socrates have left no testament. Historians therefore face the challenge of reconciling the various evidence from the extant texts in order to attempt an accurate and consistent account of Socrates's life and work. The result of such an effort is not necessarily realistic, even if consistent.\n\nTwo factors emerge from all sources pertaining to the character of Socrates: that he was ugly, and had a brilliant intellect. He lived entirely within ancient Athens, he made no writings, and died of execution by hemlock.\n\nThe character of Socrates as exhibited in \"Apology\", \"Crito\", \"Phaedo\" and \"Symposium\" concurs with other sources to an extent to which it seems possible to rely on the Platonic Socrates, as demonstrated in the dialogues, as a representation of the actual Socrates as he lived in history. At the same time, however, many scholars believe that in some works, Plato, being a literary artist, pushed his avowedly brightened-up version of \"Socrates\" far beyond anything the historical Socrates was likely to have done or said. Also, Xenophon, being an historian, is a more reliable witness to the historical Socrates. It is a matter of much debate over which Socrates it is whom Plato is describing at any given point—the historical figure, or Plato's fictionalization. As British philosopher Martin Cohen has put it, \"Plato, the idealist, offers an idol, a master figure, for philosophy. A Saint, a prophet of 'the Sun-God', a teacher condemned for his teachings as a heretic.\"\n\nIt is also clear from other writings and historical artefacts, that Socrates was not simply a character, nor an invention, of Plato. The testimony of Xenophon and Aristotle, alongside some of Aristophanes's work (especially \"The Clouds\"), is useful in fleshing out a perception of Socrates beyond Plato's work.\n\nAccording to one source, the name (), has the meaning \"whole, unwounded, safe\" (the part of the name corresponding to , ) and \"power\" (the part of the name corresponding to , ).\n\nThe problem with discerning Socrates's philosophical views stems from the perception of contradictions in statements made by the \"Socrates\" in the different dialogues of Plato; and in later dialogues Plato used the character Socrates to give voice to views that were his own. These contradictions produce doubt as to the actual philosophical doctrines of Socrates, within his milieu and as recorded by other individuals. Aristotle, in his \"Magna Moralia\", refers to Socrates in words which make it patent that the doctrine \"virtue is knowledge\" was held by Socrates. Within the \"Metaphysics\", he states Socrates was occupied with the search for moral virtues, being the \"first to search for universal definitions for them\".\n\nThe problem of understanding Socrates as a philosopher is shown in the following: In Xenophon's \"Symposium\", Socrates is reported as saying he devotes himself only to what he regards as the most important art or occupation, that of discussing philosophy. However, in \"The Clouds\", Aristophanes portrays Socrates as accepting payment for teaching and running a Sophist school with Chaerephon. Also, in Plato's \"Apology\" and \"Symposium\", as well as in Xenophon's accounts, Socrates explicitly denies accepting payment for teaching. More specifically, in the \"Apology\", Socrates cites his poverty as proof that he is not a teacher.\nTwo fragments are extant of the writings by Timon of Phlius pertaining to Socrates, although Timon is known to have written to ridicule and lampoon philosophy.\n\nDetails about the life of Socrates are derived from both contemporary sources, and later ancient period sources. Of the contemporary sources, the greater extent of information is taken from the dialogues of Plato and Xenophon (both devotees of Socrates), and the testaments of Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos, and the lesser from the plays of Aristophanes. Later ancient period sources include Apollodorus of Athens (alive during the second century BC), \nCicero (alive 106–43 BC), and Diogenes Laërtius (alive probably in the earlier half of the third century AD).\n\nThe sources are thought to have in part or wholly made use of the factual information of the life of Socrates available to each of them, to give their own interpretation of the nature of his teaching, giving rise to differing versions in each case. For example, in Aristophanes's play \"The Clouds\", Socrates is made into a clown of sorts, particularly inclined toward \"sophistry\", who teaches his students how to bamboozle their way out of debt. However, since most of Aristophanes's works function as parodies, it is presumed that his characterization in this play was also not literal. In \"Phaedo\", which is the only attested source describing the death of Socrates, Plato is thought to have selected and omitted details to provide material for his argument for the existence of the liberation of the soul from the body, an argument he possessed from learning of the ideas of Pythagoras (born sometime after 606 and died sometime after 510 BC).\n\nThe year of birth of Socrates stated is an assumed date, or estimate, given the fact of the dating of anything in ancient history in part being sometimes reliant on argument stemming from the inexact period \"floruit\" of individuals. Diogenes Laërtius stated Socrates birth date was \"the sixth day of Thargelion, the day when the Athenians purify the city\". Contemporaneous sources state, he was born not very much later than sometime after the year 471, his date of birth is within the period of years ranging 470 to 469 BC, or within a range 469 to 468 BC (corresponding to the fourth year of the 77th Olympiad).\n\nSocrates was born in Alopeke, and belonged to the tribe Antiochis. His father was Sophroniscus, a sculptor, or stonemason. His mother was a midwife named Phaenarete. Socrates married Xanthippe, who is especially remembered for having an undesirable temperament. She bore for him three sons, Lamprocles, Sophroniscus and Menexenus.\n\nSocrates first worked as a stonemason, and there was a tradition in antiquity, not credited by modern scholarship, that Socrates crafted the statues of the Charites, which stood near the Acropolis until the 2nd century AD.\n\nXenophon reports that because youths were not allowed to enter the Agora, they used to gather in workshops surrounding it. Socrates frequented these shops in order to converse with the merchants. Most notable among them was Simon the Shoemaker.\n\nFor a time, Socrates fulfilled the role of hoplite, participating in the Peloponnesian War—a conflict which stretched intermittently over a period spanning 431 to 404 BC. Several of Plato's dialogues refer to Socrates's military service.\n\nIn the monologue of the \"Apology\", Socrates states he was active for Athens in the battles of Amphipolis, Delium, and Potidaea. In the \"Symposium\", Alcibiades describes Socrates's valour in the battles of Potidaea and Delium, recounting how Socrates saved his life in the former battle (219e–221b). Socrates's exceptional service at Delium is also mentioned in the \"Laches\" by the General after whom the dialogue is named (181b). In the \"Apology,\" Socrates compares his military service to his courtroom troubles, and says anyone on the jury who thinks he ought to retreat from philosophy must also think soldiers should retreat when it seems likely that they will be killed in battle.\n\nDuring 406, he participated as a member of the \"Boule\". His tribe the Antiochis held the Prytany on the day it was debated what fate should befall the generals of the Battle of Arginusae, who abandoned the slain and the survivors of foundered ships to pursue the defeated Spartan navy.\n\nAccording to Xenophon, Socrates was the Epistates for the debate, but Delebecque and Hatzfeld think this is an embellishment, because Xenophon composed the information after Socrates's death.\n\nThe generals were seen by some to have failed to uphold the most basic of duties, and the people decided upon capital punishment. However, when the prytany responded by refusing to vote on the issue, the people reacted with threats of death directed at the prytany itself. They relented, at which point Socrates alone as epistates blocked the vote, which had been proposed by Callixeinus. The reason he gave was that \"in no case would he act except in accordance with the law\".\n\nThe outcome of the trial was ultimately judged to be a miscarriage of justice, or \"illegal\", but, actually, Socrates's decision had no support from written statutory law, instead being reliant on favouring a continuation of less strict and less formal nomos law.\n\nPlato's \"Apology\", parts 32c to 32d, describes how Socrates and four others were summoned to the Tholos, and told by representatives of the oligarchy of the Thirty (the oligarchy began ruling in 404 BC) to go to Salamis, and from there, to return to them with Leon the Salaminian. He was to be brought back to be subsequently executed. However, Socrates returned home and did not go to Salamis as he was expected to.\n\nSocrates lived during the time of the transition from the height of the Athenian hegemony to its decline with the defeat by Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian War. At a time when Athens sought to stabilize and recover from its defeat, the Athenian public may have been entertaining doubts about democracy as an efficient form of government. Socrates appears to have been a critic of democracy, and some scholars interpret his trial as an expression of political infighting.\n\nClaiming loyalty to his city, Socrates clashed with the current course of Athenian politics and society. He praised Sparta, archrival to Athens, directly and indirectly in various dialogues. One of Socrates's purported offenses to the city was his position as a social and moral critic. Rather than upholding a status quo and accepting the development of what he perceived as immorality within his region, Socrates questioned the collective notion of \"might makes right\" that he felt was common in Greece during this period. Plato refers to Socrates as the \"gadfly\" of the state (as the gadfly stings the horse into action, so Socrates stung various Athenians), insofar as he irritated some people with considerations of justice and the pursuit of goodness. His attempts to improve the Athenians' sense of justice may have been the cause of his execution.\n\nAccording to Plato's \"Apology\", Socrates's life as the \"gadfly\" of Athens began when his friend Chaerephon asked the oracle at Delphi if anyone were wiser than Socrates; the Oracle responded that no-one was wiser. Socrates believed the Oracle's response was not correct, because he believed he possessed no wisdom whatsoever. He proceeded to test the riddle by approaching men considered wise by the people of Athens—statesmen, poets, and artisans—in order to refute the Oracle's pronouncement. Questioning them, however, Socrates concluded: while each man thought he knew a great deal and was wise, in fact they knew very little and were not wise at all. Socrates realized the Oracle was correct; while so-called wise men thought themselves wise and yet were not, he himself knew he was not wise at all, which, paradoxically, made him the wiser one since he was the only person aware of his own ignorance. Socrates's paradoxical wisdom made the prominent Athenians he publicly questioned look foolish, turning them against him and leading to accusations of wrongdoing. Socrates defended his role as a gadfly until the end: at his trial, when Socrates was asked to propose his own punishment, he suggested a wage paid by the government and free dinners for the rest of his life instead, to finance the time he spent as Athens' benefactor.\n\nRobin Waterfield suggests that Socrates was a voluntary scapegoat; his death was the purifying remedy for Athens' misfortunes. In this view, the token of appreciation for Asclepius (the Greek god for curing illness) would represent a cure for Athens' ailments.\n\nOne day during the year 399 BC, Socrates went on trial and was subsequently found guilty of both corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of impiety (\"asebeia\", \"not believing in the gods of the state\"), and as a punishment sentenced to death, caused by the drinking of a mixture containing poison hemlock.\n\nSocrates's death is described at the end of Plato's \"Phaedo\", although Plato was not himself present at the execution. As to the veracity of Plato's account it seems possible he made choice of a number of certain factors perhaps omitting others in the description of the death, as the Phaedo description does not describe progress of the action of the poison (Gill 1973) in concurrence with modern descriptions. Phaedo states, after drinking the poison, he was instructed to walk around until his legs felt numb. After he lay down, the man who administered the poison pinched his foot; Socrates could no longer feel his legs. The numbness slowly crept up his body until it reached his heart.\n\nSocrates chose to cover his face during the execution (118 a6 Phaedo).\n\nAccording to \"Phaedo\" (61c–69e), Socrates states that \"[a]ll of philosophy is training for death\".\n\nSocrates' last words are thought to be ironic (C. Gill 1973), or sincere (J. Crooks 1998). Socrates speaks his last words to Crito; there are several different translations:\n\nSocrates turned down Crito's pleas to attempt an escape from prison. Xenophon and Plato agree that Socrates had an opportunity to escape, as his followers were able to bribe the prison guards. There have been several suggestions offered as reasons why he chose to stay:\n\nThe full reasoning behind his refusal to flee is the main subject of the \"Crito\". In as much as Socrates drank hemlock willingly without complaint (having decided against fleeing), R.G. Frey (1978) has suggested in truth, Socrates chose to commit suicide.\n\nPerhaps his most important contribution to Western thought is his dialectic method of inquiry, known as the Socratic method or method of \"elenchus\", which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the Good and Justice. It was first described by Plato in the \"Socratic Dialogues\". To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek. The development and practice of this method is one of Socrates's most enduring contributions, and is a key factor in earning his mantle as the father of political philosophy, ethics or moral philosophy, and as a figurehead of all the central themes in Western philosophy. The Socratic method has often been considered as a defining element of American legal education.\n\nTo illustrate the use of the Socratic method, a series of questions are posed to help a person or group to determine their underlying beliefs and the extent of their knowledge. The Socratic method is a \"negative\" method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. It was designed to force one to examine one's own beliefs and the validity of such beliefs.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the dialectic is that it is a method for direct perception of the Form of the Good. Philosopher Karl Popper describes the dialectic as \"the art of intellectual intuition, of visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances.\" In a similar vein, French philosopher Pierre Hadot suggests that the dialogues are a type of spiritual exercise. Hadot writes that \"in Plato's view, every dialectical exercise, precisely because it is an exercise of pure thought, subject to the demands of the Logos, turns the soul away from the sensible world, and allows it to convert itself towards the Good.\"\n\nThe beliefs of Socrates, as distinct from those of Plato, are difficult to discern. Little in the way of concrete evidence exists to demarcate the two. The lengthy presentation of ideas given in most of the dialogues may be the ideas of Socrates himself, but which have been subsequently deformed or changed by Plato, and some scholars think Plato so adapted the Socratic style as to make the literary character and the philosopher himself impossible to distinguish. Others argue that he did have his own theories and beliefs. There is a degree of controversy inherent in the identifying of what these might have been, owing to the difficulty of separating Socrates from Plato and the difficulty of interpreting even the dramatic writings concerning Socrates. Consequently, distinguishing the philosophical beliefs of Socrates from those of Plato and Xenophon has not proven easy, so it must be remembered that what is attributed to Socrates might actually be more the specific concerns of these two thinkers instead.\n\nThe matter is complicated because the historical Socrates seems to have been notorious for asking questions but not answering, claiming to lack wisdom concerning the subjects about which he questioned others.\n\nIf anything in general can be said about the philosophical beliefs of Socrates, it is that he was morally, intellectually, and politically at odds with many of his fellow Athenians. When he is on trial for heresy and corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens, he uses his method of \"elenchos\" to demonstrate to the jurors that their moral values are wrong-headed. He tells them they are concerned with their families, careers, and political responsibilities when they ought to be worried about the \"welfare of their souls\". Socrates's assertion that the gods had singled him out as a divine emissary seemed to provoke irritation, if not outright ridicule. Socrates also questioned the Sophistic doctrine that arete (virtue) can be taught. He liked to observe that successful fathers (such as the prominent military general Pericles) did not produce sons of their own quality. Socrates argued that moral excellence was more a matter of divine bequest than parental nurture. This belief may have contributed to his lack of anxiety about the future of his own sons.\n\nAlso, according to A. A. Long, \"There should be no doubt that, despite his claim to know only that he knew nothing, Socrates had strong beliefs about the divine\", and, citing Xenophon's \"Memorabilia\", 1.4, 4.3,:\n\nSocrates frequently says his ideas are not his own, but his teachers'. He mentions several influences: Prodicus the rhetor and Anaxagoras the philosopher. Perhaps surprisingly, Socrates claims to have been deeply influenced by two women besides his mother: he says that Diotima (cf. Plato's \"Symposium\"), a witch and priestess from Mantinea, taught him all he knows about \"eros\", or love; and that Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles, taught him the art of rhetoric. John Burnet argued that his principal teacher was the Anaxagorean Archelaus but his ideas were as Plato described them; Eric A. Havelock, on the other hand, did not accept the view that Socrates's view was identical with that of Archelaus, in large part due to the reason of such anomalies \"and\" contradictions that have surfaced and \"post-dated his death.\"\n\nMany of the beliefs traditionally attributed to the historical Socrates have been characterized as \"paradoxical\" because they seem to conflict with common sense. The following are among the so-called Socratic paradoxes:\n\nThe term, \"Socratic paradox\" can also refer to a self-referential paradox, originating in Socrates's utterance, \"what I do not know I do not think I know\", often paraphrased as \"I know that I know nothing.\"\n\nThe statement \"I know that I know nothing\" is often attributed to Socrates, based on a statement in Plato's \"Apology\". The conventional interpretation of this is that Socrates's wisdom was limited to an awareness of his own ignorance. Socrates considered virtuousness to require or consist of \"phronēsis\", \"thought, sense, judgement, practical wisdom, [and] prudence.\" Therefore, he believed that wrongdoing and behaviour that was not virtuous resulted from ignorance, and that those who did wrong knew no better.\n\nThe one thing Socrates claimed to have knowledge of was \"the art of love\" (\"ta erôtikê\"). This assertion seems to be associated with the word \"erôtan\", which means to ask questions. Therefore, Socrates is claiming to know about the art of love, insofar as he knows how to ask questions.\n\nThe only time he actually claimed to be wise was within \"Apology\", in which he says he is wise \"in the limited sense of having human wisdom\". It is debatable whether Socrates believed humans (as opposed to gods like Apollo) could actually become wise. On the one hand, he drew a clear line between human ignorance and ideal knowledge; on the other, Plato's \"Symposium\" (Diotima's Speech) and \"Republic\" (Allegory of the Cave) describe a method for ascending to wisdom.\n\nIn Plato's \"Theaetetus\" (150a), Socrates compares his treatment of the young people who come to him for philosophical advice to the way midwives treat their patients, and the way matrimonial matchmakers act. He says that he himself is a true matchmaker (προμνηστικός \"promnestikós\") in that he matches the young man to the best philosopher for his particular mind. However, he carefully distinguishes himself from a panderer (προᾰγωγός \"proagogos\") or procurer. This distinction is echoed in Xenophon's \"Symposium\" (3.20), when Socrates jokes about his certainty of being able to make a fortune, if he chose to practice the art of pandering. For his part as a philosophical interlocutor, he leads his respondent to a clearer conception of wisdom, although he claims he is not himself a teacher (\"Apology\"). His role, he claims, is more properly to be understood as analogous to a \"midwife\" (μαῖα \"maia\").\n\nIn the \"Theaetetus\", Socrates explains that he is himself barren of theories, but knows how to bring the theories of others to birth and determine whether they are worthy or mere \"wind eggs\" (ἀνεμιαῖον \"anemiaion\"). Perhaps significantly, he points out that midwives are barren due to age, and women who have never given birth are unable to become midwives; they would have no experience or knowledge of birth and would be unable to separate the worthy infants from those that should be left on the hillside to be exposed. To judge this, the midwife must have experience and knowledge of what she is judging.\n\nSocrates believed the best way for people to live was to focus on the pursuit of virtue rather than the pursuit, for instance, of material wealth. He always invited others to try to concentrate more on friendships and a sense of true community, for Socrates felt this was the best way for people to grow together as a populace. His actions lived up to this standard: in the end, Socrates accepted his death sentence when most thought he would simply leave Athens, as he felt he could not run away from or go against the will of his community; as mentioned above, his reputation for valor on the battlefield was without reproach.\n\nThe idea that there are certain virtues formed a common thread in Socrates's teachings. These virtues represented the most important qualities for a person to have, foremost of which were the philosophical or intellectual virtues. Socrates stressed that \"the unexamined life is not worth living [and] ethical virtue is the only thing that matters.\"\n\nIt is argued that Socrates believed \"ideals belong in a world only the wise man can understand\", making the philosopher the only type of person suitable to govern others. In Plato's dialogue the \"Republic\", Socrates openly objected to the democracy that ran Athens during his adult life. It was not only Athenian democracy: Socrates found short of ideal any government that did not conform to his presentation of a perfect regime led by philosophers, and Athenian government was far from that. It is, however, possible that the Socrates of Plato's \"Republic\" is colored by Plato's own views. During the last years of Socrates's life, Athens was in continual flux due to political upheaval. Democracy was at last overthrown by a junta known as the Thirty Tyrants, led by Plato's relative, Critias, who had once been a student and friend of Socrates. The Tyrants ruled for about a year before the Athenian democracy was reinstated, at which point it declared an amnesty for all recent events.\n\nSocrates's opposition to democracy is often denied, and the question is one of the biggest philosophical debates when trying to determine exactly what Socrates believed. The strongest argument of those who claim Socrates did not actually believe in the idea of philosopher kings is that the view is expressed no earlier than Plato's \"Republic\", which is widely considered one of Plato's \"Middle\" dialogues and not representative of the historical Socrates's views. Furthermore, according to Plato's \"Apology of Socrates\", an \"early\" dialogue, Socrates refused to pursue conventional politics; he often stated he could not look into other's matters or tell people how to live their lives when he did not yet understand how to live his own. He believed he was a philosopher engaged in the pursuit of Truth, and did not claim to know it fully. Socrates's acceptance of his death sentence after his conviction can also be seen to support this view. It is often claimed much of the anti-democratic leanings are from Plato, who was never able to overcome his disgust at what was done to his teacher. In any case, it is clear Socrates thought the rule of the Thirty Tyrants was also objectionable; when called before them to assist in the arrest of a fellow Athenian, Socrates refused and narrowly escaped death before the Tyrants were overthrown. He did, however, fulfill his duty to serve as \"Prytanis\" when a trial of a group of Generals who presided over a disastrous naval campaign were judged; even then, he maintained an uncompromising attitude, being one of those who refused to proceed in a manner not supported by the laws, despite intense pressure. Judging by his actions, he considered the rule of the Thirty Tyrants less legitimate than the Democratic Senate that sentenced him to death.\n\nSocrates's apparent respect for democracy is one of the themes emphasized in the 2008 play \"Socrates on Trial\" by Andrew David Irvine. Irvine argues that it was because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy that Socrates was willing to accept the verdict of his fellow citizens. As Irvine puts it, \"During a time of war and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that in a democracy the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city—even during times of war—is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"\n\nIn the Dialogues of Plato, though Socrates sometimes seems to support a mystical side, discussing reincarnation and the mystery religions, this is generally attributed to Plato. Regardless, this view of Socrates cannot be dismissed out of hand, as we cannot be sure of the differences between the views of Plato and Socrates; in addition, there seem to be some corollaries in the works of Xenophon. In the culmination of the philosophic path as discussed in Plato's \"Symposium\", one comes to the Sea of Beauty or to the sight of \"the beautiful itself\" (211C); only then can one become wise. (In the \"Symposium\", Socrates credits his speech on the philosophic path to his teacher, the priestess Diotima, who is not even sure if Socrates is capable of reaching the highest mysteries.) In the \"Meno\", he refers to the Eleusinian Mysteries, telling Meno he would understand Socrates's answers better if only he could stay for the initiations next week. Further confusions result from the nature of these sources, insofar as the Platonic Dialogues are arguably the work of an artist-philosopher, whose meaning does not volunteer itself to the passive reader nor again the lifelong scholar. According to Olympiodorus the Younger in his \"Life of Plato\", Plato himself \"received instruction from the writers of tragedy\" before taking up the study of philosophy. His works are, indeed, dialogues; Plato's choice of this, the medium of Sophocles, Euripides, and the fictions of theatre, may reflect the ever-interpretable nature of his writings, as he has been called a \"dramatist of reason\". What is more, the first word of nearly all Plato's works is a significant term for that respective dialogue, and is used with its many connotations in mind. Finally, the \"Phaedrus\" and the \"Symposium\" each allude to Socrates's coy delivery of philosophic truths in conversation; the Socrates of the \"Phaedrus\" goes so far as to demand such dissembling and mystery in all writing. The covertness we often find in Plato, appearing here and there couched in some enigmatic use of symbol and/or irony, may be at odds with the mysticism Plato's Socrates expounds in some other dialogues. These indirect methods may fail to satisfy some readers.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting facet of this is Socrates's reliance on what the Greeks called his \"daimōnic sign\", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός \"apotreptikos\") inner voice Socrates heard only when he was about to make a mistake. It was this \"sign\" that prevented Socrates from entering into politics. In the \"Phaedrus\", we are told Socrates considered this to be a form of \"divine madness\", the sort of insanity that is a gift from the gods and gives us poetry, mysticism, love, and even philosophy itself. Alternately, the \"sign\" is often taken to be what we would call \"intuition\"; however, Socrates's characterization of the phenomenon as \"daimōnic\" may suggest that its origin is divine, mysterious, and independent of his own thoughts. Today, such a voice would be classified under the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" as a command hallucination.\n\nSocrates practiced and advocated divination. Xenophon was thought skilled at foretelling from sacrifices, and attributed many of his knowledges to Socrates within his writing \"The Cavalry Commander\".\n\nHe was prominently lampooned in Aristophanes's comedy \"The Clouds\", produced when Socrates was in his mid-forties; he said at his trial (according to Plato) that the laughter of the theater was a harder task to answer than the arguments of his accusers. Søren Kierkegaard believed this play was a more accurate representation of Socrates than those of his students. In the play, Socrates is ridiculed for his dirtiness, which is associated with the Laconizing fad; also in plays by Callias, Eupolis, and Telecleides. Other comic poets who lampooned Socrates include Mnesimachus and Ameipsias. In all of these, Socrates and the Sophists were criticized for \"the moral dangers inherent in contemporary thought and literature\".\n\nPlato, Xenophon, and Aristotle are the main sources for the historical Socrates; however, Xenophon and Plato were students of Socrates, and they may idealize him; however, they wrote the only extended descriptions of Socrates that have come down to us in their complete form. Aristotle refers frequently, but in passing, to Socrates in his writings. Almost all of Plato's works center on Socrates. However, Plato's later works appear to be more his own philosophy put into the mouth of his mentor.\n\nThe \"Socratic Dialogues\" are a series of dialogues written by Plato and Xenophon in the form of discussions between Socrates and other persons of his time, or as discussions between Socrates's followers over his concepts. Plato's \"Phaedo\" is an example of this latter category. Although his \"Apology\" is a monologue delivered by Socrates, it is usually grouped with the Dialogues.\n\nThe \"Apology\" professes to be a record of the actual speech Socrates delivered in his own defense at the trial. In the Athenian jury system, an \"apology\" is composed of three parts: a speech, followed by a counter-assessment, then some final words. \"Apology\" is an anglicized transliteration, not a translation, of the Greek \"apologia\", meaning \"defense\"; in this sense it is not apologetic according to our contemporary use of the term.\n\nPlato generally does not place his own ideas in the mouth of a specific speaker; he lets ideas emerge via the Socratic Method, under the guidance of Socrates. Most of the dialogues present Socrates applying this method to some extent, but nowhere as completely as in the \"Euthyphro\". In this dialogue, Socrates and Euthyphro go through several iterations of refining the answer to Socrates's question, \"...What is the pious, and what the impious?\"\n\nIn Plato's Dialogues, learning appears as a process of remembering. The soul, before its incarnation in the body, was in the realm of Ideas (very similar to the Platonic \"Forms\"). There, it saw things the way they truly are, rather than the pale shadows or copies we experience on earth. By a process of questioning, the soul can be brought to remember the ideas in their pure form, thus bringing wisdom.\n\nEspecially for Plato's writings referring to Socrates, it is not always clear which ideas brought forward by Socrates (or his friends) actually belonged to Socrates and which of these may have been new additions or elaborations by Plato—this is known as the Socratic Problem. Generally, the early works of Plato are considered to be close to the spirit of Socrates, whereas the later works—including \"Phaedo\" and \"Republic\"—are considered to be possibly products of Plato's elaborations.\n\nImmediately, the students of Socrates set to work both on exercising their perceptions of his teachings in politics and also on developing many new philosophical schools of thought. Some of Athens' controversial and anti-democratic tyrants were contemporary or posthumous students of Socrates including Alcibiades and Critias. Critias's cousin Plato would go on to found the Academy in 385 BC, which gained so much renown that \"Academy\" became the standard word for educational institutions in later European languages such as English, French, and Italian. Plato's protégé, another important figure of the Classical era, Aristotle went on to tutor Alexander the Great and also to found his own school in 335 BC—the Lyceum—whose name also now means an educational institution.\n\nWhile \"Socrates dealt with moral matters and took no notice at all of nature in general\", in his Dialogues, Plato would emphasize mathematics with metaphysical overtones mirroring that of Pythagoras—the former who would dominate Western thought well into the Renaissance. Aristotle himself was as much of a philosopher as he was a scientist with extensive work in the fields of biology and physics.\n\nSocratic thought which challenged conventions, especially in stressing a simplistic way of living, became divorced from Plato's more detached and philosophical pursuits. This idea was inherited by one of Socrates's older students, Antisthenes, who became the originator of another philosophy in the years after Socrates's death: Cynicism.\n\nThe idea of asceticism being hand in hand with an ethical life or one with piety, ignored by Plato and Aristotle and somewhat dealt with by the Cynics, formed the core of another philosophy in 281 BC—Stoicism when Zeno of Citium would discover Socrates's works and then learn from Crates, a Cynic philosopher.\n\nWhile some of the later contributions of Socrates to Hellenistic Era culture and philosophy as well as the Roman Era have been lost to time, his teachings began a resurgence in both medieval Europe and the Islamic Middle East alongside those of Aristotle and Stoicism. Socrates is mentioned in the dialogue Kuzari by Jewish philosopher and rabbi Yehuda Halevi in which a Jew instructs the Khazar king about Judaism. Al-Kindi, a well-known Arabic philosopher, introduced and tried to reconcile Socrates and Hellenistic philosophy to an Islamic audience, referring to him by the name 'Suqrat'.\n\nSocrates influence grew in Western Europe during the fourteenth century as Plato's dialogues were made available in Latin by Marsilio Ficino and Xenophon's Socratic writings were translated by Basilios Bessarion. Voltaire even went so far as to write a satirical play about the trial of Socrates. There were a number of paintings about his life including \"Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure\" by Jean-Baptiste Regnault and \"The Death of Socrates\" by Jacques-Louis David in the later 18th century.\n\nTo this day, different versions of the Socratic method are still used in classroom and law school discourse to expose underlying issues in both subject and the speaker. He has been recognized with accolades ranging from frequent mentions in pop culture (such as the movie \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\" and a Greek rock band called Socrates Drank the Conium) to numerous busts in academic institutions in recognition of his contribution to education.\n\nOver the past century, numerous plays about Socrates have also focused on Socrates's life and influence. One of the most recent has been \"Socrates on Trial\", a play based on Aristophanes's \"Clouds\" and Plato's \"Apology\", \"Crito\", and \"Phaedo\", all adapted for modern performance.\n\nEvaluation of and reaction to Socrates has been undertaken by both historians and philosophers from the time of his death to the present day with a multitude of conclusions and perspectives. Although he was not directly prosecuted for his connection to Critias, leader of the Spartan-backed Thirty Tyrants, and \"showed considerable personal courage in refusing to submit to [them]\", he was seen by some as a figure who mentored oligarchs who became abusive tyrants, and undermined Athenian democracy. The Sophistic movement that he railed at in life survived him, but by the 3rd century BC, was rapidly overtaken by the many philosophical schools of thought that Socrates influenced.\n\nSocrates's death is considered iconic and his status as a martyr of philosophy overshadows most contemporary and posthumous criticism. However, Xenophon mentions Socrates's \"arrogance\" and that he was \"an expert in the art of primping\" or \"self-presentation\". Direct criticism of Socrates the man almost disappears after this time, but there is a noticeable preference for Plato or Aristotle over the elements of Socratic philosophy distinct from those of his students, even into the Middle Ages.\n\nSome modern scholarship holds that, with so much of his own thought obscured and possibly altered by Plato, it is impossible to gain a clear picture of Socrates amid all the contradictory evidence. That both Cynicism and Stoicism, which carried heavy influence from Socratic thought, were unlike or even contrary to Platonism further illustrates this. The ambiguity and lack of reliability serves as the modern basis of criticism—that it is nearly impossible to know the real Socrates. Some controversy also exists about Socrates's attitude towards homosexuality and as to whether or not he believed in the Olympian gods, was monotheistic, or held some other religious viewpoint. However, it is still commonly taught and held with little exception that Socrates is the progenitor of subsequent Western philosophy, to the point that philosophers before him are referred to as pre-Socratic.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38515895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38515895", "title": "Sung Jae-gi", "text": "Sung Jae-gi\n\nSung Jae-gi ( ; September 11, 1967 – July 26, 2013) was a South Korean men's rights activist and anti-feminist. Sung founded and was the first chairman of Man of Korea, a men's rights group advocating the abolition of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family—whose Korean name (여성부; 女性部) translates as \"Ministry of Women\"—and demanded compensation for the South Korean military-service requirement. He also argued for free love and sexual and male liberation.\n\nDuring the early 21st century, Sung led the South Korean anti-feminist movement opposing female-preferential policies. In early adulthood he was a businessman, and in October 1999 he participated in the movement opposing the abolition of preferential treatment for discharged soldiers. Sung also opposed the abolition of the Hoju system, and later participated in men's-rights activities. In 2006 he founded the Association of Anti-Feminism and Male Liberation, and in 2007 he founded the Association for the Abolition of the Ministry of Women. The following year, Sung founded Man of Korea and was its chairman from 2008 until his death in 2013. His business activities included a nightclub and a consulting and executive search company.\n\nFrom 1999 until his death Sung argued for the restoration of the Korean Army bonus points system, and during the early 2010s he was an activist for the abolition of women-only facilities. In 2011, he began offering assistance and counseling to battered husbands, househusbands, teenage runaways and male and child victims of violent crime. Sung opened a shelter for homeless persons, male victims of violent crime, teenage runaways and gay and transgender people. From 1999 to 2013, Sung was part of the gender liberation and liberal movements and the movement to abolish the women's special-benefits policy.\n\nNear the end of his life Sung was reportedly up to ₩200 million in debt, and on July 25, 2013 he posted on the Man of Korea website his intention to commit suicide. The next day, in what was thought a publicity stunt to benefit the Men's Alliance (his group), Sung jumped from the Mapo Bridge in Seoul. His body was found four days later.\n\nSung wrote under the pen names Blue Wolf (), Tongbalbass () and Tongbal (), and his nickname was Shimheon (심헌 審軒 or 심헌 心軒). His family is part of the Changnyeong Sung clan (창녕성씨 昌寧成氏).\n\nSung was born in Daegu on September 11, 1967. His father was wealthy, and his one uncle was a police officer in Daegu. During his youth, he developed masculinity and machismo. Sung became hostile, and was repulsed by traditional masculine behavior. In adolescence he became convinced of the need for men's liberation: \"I was so grown, but nowadays teenage and 20, 30s young men are not like that. They tell another if it hurts, 'I am sick', tell another if they're tired, 'I am tired'.\n\nAt that time Sung became conscious of authority, developed a loathing for the patriarchal system and complained that South Korean society treated males cruelly. After graduating from Daegu High School, he began studying economics at Yeungnam University in 1985 and graduated in February 1993.\n\nIn 1987, Sung joined the South Korean Army and served with the 3rd Infantry Division (육군 제3보병사단 陸軍第三步兵師團) in Cheolwon (Gangwon Province) until 1990. He spent his early twenties as an insurance salesman, briefly managing his own business. In 2006, he operated a night club in Daegu. From August 26 to November 30 of that year, Sung worked for the Thomas McFly Consulting and Headhunting Company (토마스 맥플라이 컨설팅 & 헤드헌팅사) in the Eastern District of Daegu before resigning to continue his human-rights campaigns.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, Sung joined the South Korean men's rights movement and campaigned for a variety of causes. On November 26, 2006 he founded the Association of Anti-Feminism for the Liberation of Men (), and on January 4, 2007 he founded the Association for the Abolition of the Ministry of Women (, 女性部廢止運動本部). In 2013, both groups had several thousand members. Sung campaigned for the abolition of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in the 2002 and 2007 presidential elections, questioning its justification. After the 2000s Sung emphasized personal values, individual rights and the right to privacy in his speeches, saying that personal values are God-given rights. He later led a campaign to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality.\n\nIn August 1994 Sung married Park Eun-kyong, an internist and professor at the College of Medicine of Chung-ang University. They had two daughters.\n\nIn 1999 Sung opposed abolishing the South Korean military's bonus-points system (군 가산점;軍 加算點) and military veterans' compensation, and supported the abolition of the South Korean female quota (여성 할당제;女性割當制) and female employment quota systems (여성고용할당제;女性雇傭割當制). From 2004 to January 2005, he unsuccessfully opposed the abolition of the Hoju system (호주제 戶主制). Sung advocated the resurrection of the South Korean military bonus-points system and the abolition of female quotas until his death.\n\nRailing against what he saw as female chauvinism and Korean totalitarianism, he argued against reverse discrimination, said \"Men are humans\", objected to unilateral obligations and responsibilities imposed on Korean men and advocated men's liberation. According to Sung, \"The oppressive measures on pornography by the Korean government are totally insane ... It is actually seen that it oppresses masculinity and that it distorts the essentials. It is all done by the Ministry of Gender Equality and women’s organizations led by Korean feminists.\" He argued that the totalitarianism of a few female chauvinists excessively suppressed male sexuality, the arts, pop culture and freedom of expression and thought.\n\nComparing South Korean government policies to prohibition in the United States, Sung said that restricting pornography had undesirable side effects and labeled normal men as sex offenders. He encouraged self-examination to overcome sexual Puritanism: \"You will understand easily if you know a bit about men’s sexual mechanism. Pornography itself can ease and satisfy men’s sexual impulses.\" Long criticized for his beliefs, Sung called South Korean policy excessively moralistic and overprotective of women and some South Korean politicians unrealistic and incompetent.\n\nFrom August 1999 to 2001, Sung advocated the protection of the South Korean military's bonus-points system and had a small number of sympathizers. In October 2001 the system was found unconstitutional and repealed, with Sung advocating its reconstruction: \"What is my duty? Do you know why Man of Korea started? Because in 1999 military bonus points were abolished! Because of the excuse of gender equality for threatening national security.\"\n\nSung long argued for the \"resuscitation of military bonus points\", reviving a reconstruction movement for the Korean military bonus-points system in 2011. He participated in civil-rights and masculist activities, leading a male-liberation movement. Sung requested compensation for his mandatory South Korean military service until his death.\n\nFrom 2004 to January 2005 Sung supported the Hoju system, reasoning that the system supported the last rights of fathers. Feeling that the system had symbolic meaning for fathers and families, he argued with South Korean radical feminists on the Internet. The Hoju system was abolished in January 2005, and Sung advocated its revival until his death.\n\nHe long criticized the Ministry of Gender Equality. On December 12, 2012, Sung told presidential candidate Park Geun-hye that to \"recover lost fathers' rights is the way for my family's happiness\".\n\nFrom 2008 until his death, Sung was protective of weak men and disadvantaged, gay and transgender people and advocated for the protection of male and young victims of domestic violence. He opened male-protection facilities, the first on January 26, 2008 in Samsung-dong, Gangnam-gu.\n\nSung supported refuges in Samseong-dong in Gangnam-gu, Seokcheon-dong in Songpa-gu and Yeongdeungpo-dong in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. He opposed racism and discrimination against minorities, male victims of crime, the weak and sexual minorities. Sung encouraged the recognition of homophobia, emphasizing that sexuality is personal, and provided accommodations and job placement for homeless, unemployed young male runaways and gay and transgender people. He opened the Man of Korea headquarters as a shelter on May 1, 2012.\n\nOn January 24, 2011, Sung opened a free facility in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul for runaway husbands, young deported men, runaway teenage boys and homeless men. After a slow start, the facility took in an increasing number of people.\n\nSung opposed crackdowns on pornography until his death, arguing that it reduced the number of sex crimes. At a conference, he said that if women's attire does not cause sex crimes, neither does pornography.\n\nAccording to Sung, pornography was necessary for economically- and physically-unattractive men. At a November 12, 2011 debate entitled \"How Should We Regulate Child Pornography?\" hosted by Choi Min-hee of the Democratic United Party at the National Assembly building in Yeouido, Seoul, Sung said: \"Who are those crazy beings who oppose the protection of children and teens against sex crimes? ... The problem is the Burberry men [exhibitionists]. We should catch them, and not just make them not wear Burberry trench coats.\" Sung became an overnight hero to male netizens for defending online pornography and masturbation as benign.\n\nDuring a public hearing of the National Assembly that day, Sung criticized the Ministry of Gender Equality: \"For those people who don't even understand the mechanisms of the male sex, what Youth Sex Protection Law do you want? What law do you want to be made? ... Who are those crazy beings who oppose the protection of children and teens against sex crimes? Of course our priority is to protect kids and teens against sexual offenses. Have any of you watched porn before? Have you watched porn to masturbate? Yes or no? But let me ask you one thing: is your goal to protect children and teenager from sexual offences? or is it to suppress every man’s sexual desire and control his guilt?Female exposure is not the cause of one’s sex drive, and is not the cause of sex offenses, and yet animated porn becomes the cause of a man’s sex crimes? Please stop making such bullshit claims! I don’t know about other men, but isn’t this nonsense? I too watch porn! And you know why?\" He said that pornography was \"a means for a man to ease his sex drive, relieve himself, and excrete his load. So because porn amplifies a man’s sex drive, this makes him go outside, find a new victim and commit a new sex crime? Please stop romanticizing the whole thing!\" According to Sung, \"Just 20 years ago, women would go to the pharmacy and hide their sanitary pads in newspaper and buy them as if they were drugs. But 20 years later, Korean women’s sanitary pads are in your face, and they even have a menstruation festival ... Had men not acknowledged and understood femininity, do you think this would have been possible?\"\n\nOn January 26, 2008, Sung founded Man of Korea (, 男性聯帶) in Gangnam-gu, Seoul to promote men's rights, saying that men could be considered a minority in South Korean society. He publicly disparaged women and worked to abolish menstrual leave and other policies for working women. Opponents said that Sung's work to support the rights of men was misplaced because South Korea is a male-dominated society.\n\nDuring the 2012 Korean presidential election Sung suggested abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, denying that women are a social minority and accusing Korean society of discriminating against men. He controversially posted on his Twitter account, \"Korean women, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Why are you making such a fuss about menstruating when the nation’s birthrate is the lowest in the world?\"\n\nSung mocked the White Tie Campaign organized by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, saying that the campaign supported prostitution (although he was said to have supported prostitution). On November 28–29, 2011, Man of Korea launched their \"White Stockings Campaign\" in an email to members.\n\nThe email claimed that the campaign was supported by the ministry, but the campaign lampooned the ministry’s support program for former prostitutes. Man of Korea claimed that under the ministry plan, former prostitutes would receive job training at support centers and the ministry would give them ₩410,000 per month and legal and medical services for up to three years. Sung was criticized for his support of prostitution and said on November 30, \"We wanted to show that the ministry’s support program for former prostitutes is not effective. The ministry spends about 11-12 billion won per year on the program. But such support is given to any women who claim they were prostitutes, and the ministry is unable to verify whether they were really engaged in the sex trade or not\".\nHis view that prostitutes were not victims contrasted with that of South Korean feminists, and he opposed treating female prostitution as a crime.\n\nSung criticized South Korean menstrual leave as sexist, arguing that it was unnecessary for most women since it protected motherhood. On October 3, 2012, he controversially posted on his Twitter account: \"You [Korean women] should be ashamed of yourselves. Why are you making such a fuss about menstruating when the nation's birthrate is the lowest in the world?\" According to a January 2013 report by Alio, a website compiling management information in the public sector, 9.1 percent (272 out of 2,993) executive jobs in government departments and public firms were held by women and over half of the organizations had no female board members.\n\nIn early July 2013, Sung's wife briefly left him. On July 25, he declared himself a victim of reverse discrimination and announced his intention to commit suicide. Sung jumped from the Mapo Bridge into the Han River, leaving a note saying that he would risk his life to raise ₩100 million (about $94,000) in donations to pay debts owed by Man of Korea.\n\nHe posted on the organization's website, \"Dear citizens, I plan to jump off a bridge over the Han River. I hope you give us a last chance. Please lend us 100 million won which will be used for paying back debt and seed money of our organization\". Sung's announcement was met with indifference. \"Ridiculous. He is begging for money and he’s holding himself as a hostage\", read a post on the Man of Korea homepage. Another read, \"Threat fund-raiser? That’s creative. Just jump off the bridge like you promised\". Sung later said that he did not intend to commit suicide, but wanted to draw attention to his group; he would jump, whether or not he received the money. He posted on Twitter, \"Why do you all assume that jumping off the bridge will kill me? I have complete confidence in my survival\", and later said: \"Please regard my actions as 'trying to be less pathetic' while asking for money\". Some Man of Korea members and other supporters were concerned about the jump.\n\nSung repeated his intention to survive the jump, saying that the bulgogi party scheduled for 7 pm in his office that day was still on. \"That’s why I said I’ll jump BEFORE 7 o’clock. Let’s eat bulgogi\", he said. Before Sung jumped off the bridge, he wrote \"I'm confident that I can survive\". He checked the depth of the water before he jumped, and arranged for a lifeguard to watch the jump. However, he acknowledged the risk: \"If something goes wrong with me, the Secretary General will succeed me as the representative of the association. Please remember me even if my lame attempt fails.\" He left a note:\n\n<poem></poem>\n\nOn July 26, 2013, Sung took a taxi from Yeongdeungpo to Mapo District with Han Seung-oh, Lee Ji-hun and five other people. Although he was accompanied by two lifeguards, it had rained heavily that day and the day before. At 3:00 pm, Sung jumped from the Mapo Bridge.\n\nRescue efforts began at about 3:20 pm, and a broad search of the Han River was conducted. Although about 30 firefighters and a helicopter searched near the Mapo Bridge, he was not found by 9 pm Friday and the search was suspended for the night. About 50 firefighters from the Yeongdeungpo Fire Station, one helicopter and three rescue boats continued the search Saturday and Sunday; six ambulances stood by. In July 28, 2013.\n\nSung's body was found near the south end of the Seogang Bridge, connecting Yeouido to northern Seoul, on July 29. \nHe was barefoot, and his white shirt and dark-gray pants were what he was wearing when he jumped. On August 1, Sung was cremated and his ashes buried in a crypt in the Gyongsan Park Cemetery (경산 공원 묘원) in Namchon (남천면), Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang. There was a reported month-long increase in copycat suicides in August 2013.\n\nAfter Sung's funeral he was compared on the Internet to Jeon Tae-il, a 22-year-old factory employee who immolated himself in 1970 to protest working conditions. According to the \"Korea Times\", the online grief and rage were misplaced. Han Seung-oh, Sung's nominated successor and a founding member of Man of Korea, called Sung's jump a \"risky stunt\" to raise ₩100 million for the organization.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1016702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1016702", "title": "The Man with the Twisted Lip", "text": "The Man with the Twisted Lip\n\n\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the sixth of the twelve stories in \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\". The story was first published in the \"Strand Magazine\" in December 1891. Doyle ranked \"The Man with the Twisted Lip<nowiki>\"</nowiki> sixteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\nLate at night, Kate Whitney, a friend of Dr. Watson's wife, calls on them. Her husband, Isa, has been absent for several days. Frantic with worry, she begs Dr. Watson to fetch him home from the opium den where he goes. Watson does this; but he also finds his friend Sherlock Holmes in the den, disguised as an old man, seeking for clues among the habitués of the place.\n\nThe case involves Mr. Neville St. Clair, a prosperous, respectable, punctual man, who is missing. His family's home is in the country, but he visits London every day on business. One day when Mr. St. Clair was in London, Mrs. St. Clair also went to London separately. She happened to pass down Upper Swandam Lane, a \"vile alley\" near the London docks, where the opium den is. Glancing up, she saw her husband at a second-floor window of the opium den. He vanished from the window immediately, and Mrs. St. Clair was sure that there was something wrong.\n\nShe tried to enter the building; but her way was blocked by the opium den's owner, a lascar. She fetched the police, but they did not find Mr. St. Clair. The room behind the window was the lair of a dirty, disfigured beggar, known to the police as Hugh Boone. The police were about to put her story down as a mistake of some kind when Mrs. St. Clair noticed a box of wooden toy bricks that her husband said he would buy for their son. A further search turned up some of St. Clair's clothes. Later, his coat, with the pockets stuffed with hundreds of pennies and halfpennies, was found on the bank of Thames, just below the building's back window.\n\nHugh Boone was arrested at once, but would say nothing, except to deny any knowledge of St. Clair. He also resisted any attempt to make him wash. Holmes was initially quite convinced that St. Clair had been murdered, and that Boone was involved. Thus his investigation of the den in disguise. He and Watson return to St. Clair's home, to a surprise. It is several days after the disappearance; but that day Mrs. St. Clair had received a letter from her husband in his own handwriting, with his wedding ring enclosed, telling her not to worry. This forces Holmes to reconsider his conclusions, leading him eventually to an extraordinary solution.\n\nHolmes and Watson go the police station where Hugh Boone is held; Holmes brings a bath sponge in a Gladstone bag. Finding Boone asleep, Holmes washes the sleeping Boone's dirty face—revealing Neville St. Clair.\n\nMr. St. Clair has been leading a double life, as a respectable businessman, and as a professional beggar. In his youth, he had been an actor before becoming a newspaper reporter. In order to research an article, he had disguised himself as a beggar for a short time, and collected a surprising amount of money. Later, he was saddled with a large debt, and returned to the street to beg for several days to pay it off. His newspaper salary was meagre and, tempted by the much larger returns of begging, he eventually became a professional beggar. His takings were large enough that he was able to establish himself as a country gentleman, marry well, and begin a respectable family. His wife and children never knew what he did for a living, and when arrested, he feared exposure more than prison or the gallows. But there is no murder, so he is released, and Holmes and the police agree to keep Mr. St. Clair's secret as long as no more is heard of Hugh Boone.\n\nThe selling of opium or other drugs was in and of itself no crime in the London of 1889. Although the opium den was an environment connected with crime and underworld, it operated openly and legally.\n\nA contention is that many Sherlockian mysteries have solutions based on seemingly unlikely events. The ability of St. Clair to earn a good living begging is considered by some to be such a plot point, but others disagree. For example, in Toronto a woman known as the \"shaky bag lady\" did this very thing, surpassing the efforts of common beggars by presenting herself as more pathetic than legitimate beggars. In Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, several beggars are reportedly Rupee millionaires. A Putney beggar reportedly earned £300 per day, a sum roughly equivalent to the 99th percentile of UK earnings. A Grand Central Terminal panhandler claimed to be \"raking up\" $200 an hour.\n\nIn one in-universe point of interest, Watson's wife Mary calls him by the name \"James\" despite his established first name being \"John\". This has led fans to suggest that Watson's middle name, which is only alluded to as \"H.\", could be \"Hamish\", a variant of the name James. Doyle never addressed the possibility during his lifetime.\n\nA silent version of \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" was filmed in 1921, directed by Maurice Elvey.\n\nIn 1951, Rudolph Cartier produced an adaptation entitled \"The Man Who Disappeared\". This adaptation was a pilot for a proposed television series starring John Longden as Holmes and Campbell Singer as Watson.\n\nIn 1964, the story was adapted into an episode of the BBC series \"Sherlock Holmes\" starring Douglas Wilmer and Nigel Stock, with Peter Madden as Inspector Lestrade and Anton Rodgers as Neville St Clair. The adaptation developed St Clair's attributed ability at repartee by showing him quoting from the classics, including Shakespeare.\n\nGranada Television also produced a version in 1986, adapted by Alan Plater as part of their \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\" television series.\n\n\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1990 as part of Bert Coules' complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson.\n\nThe 2014 \"Sherlock\" episode \"His Last Vow\" begins with Sherlock being found in a drug den by John, reminiscent of the scene in the opium den from this story.\n\n"}

Shenoy\n\nVasudev Vaman Shenoy (15 February 1940 – 9 March 2015), better known as V.V.Shenoy, was a notable Educationist, Educational Counsellor, Journalist and a Social Activist. He was also a plants enthusiast and very popular for the Panchavati Terrace Gardens that he developed on the terrace of his house frequented by several eminent personalities over the time. He is the Founder Director of \"Students' Information & Guidance Bureau\", an institution recognised for educational counselling. solving unemployment problems and for supporting and encouraging students to pursue their educational programs for further employment and choice of career. V.V.Shenoy died on 9 March 2015 due to medical complications.\n\nV. V. Shenoy was born on 15 Feb 1940 in Borkatte, Karkala Taluk, Karnataka. He did his initial schooling in a small village elementary school in Borkatte. Due to the poor financial conditions at home he got out at the very young age of 14 and ventured out in search of work. He then pursued his high school education at S.V.T. Higher Elementary School, St. Thomas High School, Honnavar and then Janata Vidyalaya, Dandeli , part by part, with the help of the finances he managed to earn through the chores he did at various places. He then came to Belgaum around the year 1963 to pursue his higher education and did his Bachelor of Science at \"R.L.S. College\", Belgaum. He was known for his commanding and leadership qualities and always had a soft corner for all his fellow students and other people. Be it Academics, extracurricular activities, National Cadet Corps (India), representing the college or various other organizations and other social activities, he's known to excel in all. During his B.Sc education days, he had to support his family back in his hometown as well as look after his basic needs in Belgaum. This is when he saw and realized the amount of difficulties students faced at their peak age of career decision making and education attaining phase. He then pursued and successfully completed his Bachelor of Education in Belgaum as he believed that it would help him in understanding the students’ issues and the situation of the educational system. In the year 1968 he started (invented) a unique organization called Students' Information & Guidance Bureau . This organization served (and still does) over 60 lac members/students by solving, guiding and helping them achieve their higher education and career choices. In the last ~40 years, he worked and served in innumerable organizations/fields mainly including Journalism, Horticulture and Kannada & Konkani Culture, Literature and Traditions. He always believed that it was not necessary to be a Politician, Minister or a Celebrity to be a social worker and work for the welfare of the people.\n\n\"Students' Information & Guidance Bureau\" or SIGB was founded by Vasudev V Shenoy in the year 1968. He was approx 28 years old when he started the institution. Located at Shanivar Khoot, Kakatives in Belgaum City, this Institution provides guidance, detailed information of various courses available at various universities, apprenticeship available at private industrial sectors, scholarships provided by various institutions, government job opportunities, detailed information of banking, LIC and other such examinations, competitive exams, engineering and medical education facilities, job opportunities available for the youth and many other such information in and around Belgaum city and North Karnataka. The institution also had a branch office at Tilakwadi, Belgaum for over 30 years which was later closed in 2006 as he preferred concentrating and personally attending to and devoting his time at one place at the head office. This Institution is not a Government run office, Employment Exchange, University Branch office/Agency or any other Institute but a private run Institution for the well-being of the students.\nSIGB has further sub sections of functioning i.e. \"STUDENTS’ HELPLINE\" through which candidates pursue their U.G and P.G correspondence courses for a couple of Universities in Karnataka and \"STUDENTS’ BOOK BUREAU\" where the latest and current Job Opportunities in various sectors are managed for the candidates.\n\nA separate division was started for providing special guidance to the youth and the underprivileged in 1981.\nThe then Education Minister \"G.B.Shankar Rao\" inaugurated this division and officially became the first member on that day.\n\n\"V.V. Shenoy\" personally attended to and guided most of the students to attain information and achieve education in their particular preferred field of interest. A lot of poor or underprivileged students seeking help guidance or information, have gained much so that they could complete their education. He had a wide range of sources from where he collected all the knowledge and information which he imparted onto the candidates. Important information/ news / ads reported in the various newspapers in various languages are compiled and made available on the notice board for the candidates’ perusal on a daily basis. Job opportunities list is made available to all the candidates on the notice board.\n\nGuides, Books, Old/model question papers thousands of reference books and important education, commerce, science, current affairs etc. related documents, collected from over the last 30 years are made available for the candidates’ reference. This institution has helped and has had above 60 lakh members over the time.\n\nSeveral personalities and notable persons have visited over the time and commended Shenoy’s unique venture and his desire to work for the society and students in particular. Few of them namely \"G.B. Shankar Rao\", S. R. Nayak, , \"OmPrakash\", , \"P J Nayak\", , \"PS Ramanujan\", \"S. V. JaishilRao\", \"H. M. Nagaraja Rao\", \"G. V. Naik\", , \"H. M. Nayak\", \"R. Shankarappa\", , \"I. M. Vithalmurthy\", Charuhasan, etc. Also eminent Kannada writers like Krishnamoorthy Puranik, K. Shivaram Karanth, U. R. Ananthamurthy, Santosh Kumar Gulwadi, \"Vyasrai Ballal\" and many more have visited SIGB.\n\nSIGB currently functions and looked after by Mrs. Aruna Vasudev Shenoy.\n\n \nAn interesting \"laboratory\" for students of the schools around, a pleasant spot for visitors to the house to chat in, a cool tension free retreat for the family to spend an evening in – this is what V.V. Shenoy has created on his modest terrace. In his own words, his garden is a combination of Duty and Beauty. When this duty is undertaken with an eye for beauty, the effort takes a marvelous shape, with vegetable and fruit trees, flowering plants, Crotons and herbs swaying happily in perfect harmony. The variety of plants and trees blending perfectly into a harmony of colors and shapes is bewilderingly wide that it needs the owner to introduce to some of the rare ones. In this garden the mighty Banyan tree stands side by side with the humble shoe flower plant, the common Tulsi, Neem, Bluebells, Jasmines and Roses.\nThe spicy Clove, Cardamom, Pepper, Jaiphal and Coffee, rub shoulders (or rather branches) with the fragrant Champa, Dreamy Rajnigandha, colourful Mayflower and prosaic Rubber and Coconut trees. All are planted in pots 22\" and less in height! Even the spaces below the bigger trees like Jamun, Seedless Mangoes, Chickoo, Mosambi, Pomegranate, Areca nut, Lemon and Guavas are lined with useful herbs like Ajwain, Pudina, Coriander, Lemongrass, Brahmi and Betel Leaves. One can see fruits growing in the most unbelievable conditions like a Mango of the size of a complete human palm, growing on a tree/plant just 3 feet tall, pineapples growing in the pot, large sized pomegranates, lemons, button oranges, sugar lemons, and even 15\" long ladies finger on a long slender plant. The garden also boasts of exotic plants like Strawberries, Annapurna (a long leafy plant which put in the cooker while making rice gives an aroma of Basmati rice), AloeVera, Wild Berries, White Jamun or the Jaam, Starfruit, Chayote, Stevia (a plant very famous for diabetes controlling and eradicating powers), Brahmakamal and many more \n\nThe little green empire on the roof, making a mockery of the usual rough and rugged concrete terrace also mocks at the main misconception connected with gardening – that gardening is the monopoly of the aristocratic with sprawling acres, plenty of money to spend on manure, saplings and gardeners.\nThis garden is looked after by the family themselves without any professional gardener on duty which is a matter of pride and pleasure for them. This also leads to another fascinating hobby of ornithology, because of the innumerable birds coming in, thanks to the flowers and fruits.\n\nNatural manure consisting of household waste, dried leaves and flowers from the garden etc. is used in place of chemical and artificial manures. This does away with the problem of garbage disposal and also ill effects of chemical fertilizers are avoided. V. V. Shenoy followed the phrase \"“kasa dinda rasa”\" (best out of waste) very practically. It is not the availability of the water alone that is important but correct management. All the waste water from the kitchen etc. is diverted to the garden for the plants.\nThis terrace garden also serves as a natural air conditioner for the house controlling the temperature inside it. The natural conditions created within the pots are perhaps excellent guards against extremes of temperatures. Thus even seasonal fruits and vegetables are reaped almost throughout the year.\n\nThe accolades of distinguished visitors like the then Union Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar, Mr. Suresh Angadi, . Dr. Vittal Rai, Vice-Chancellor of the Agriculture University, Dharwad, Dr. Beer Singh Chowdary, , U.T. Alwa, have added to the enthusiasm of the garden lover. \nThe Shenoy family believes that if everybody follows this practice, of having at least a small group of plants, will keep the cities cool, green and above all healthy.\n\nV.V. Shenoy has also worked as one of the Directors of the Horticulture Department, Belgaum. Flower and Fruit shows and exhibitions and competitions have been organized every year in Hume Park, Club Road, Belgaum, under the able guidance and active participation of V. V. Shenoy. He organized, conducted and managed to dedicatedly work for the research and development of plants even amidst his busy schedule involving his activities of his office.\n\nV.V. Shenoy married \"Aruna\", daughter of \"Smt. Rukmini\" & \"Shri. Laxman Prabhu\", , Karkala, in the year 1976. They have three children, \"Dr. Rashmi V. Shenoy\", \"Chetan V. Shenoy\" and \"Anupkumar V. Shenoy\".\n\nTo quote, a few institutions and organisations in which he has put his heart and soul and worked hard for the welfare of the society at large, are as follows:\nand many more...\n\n"}
{"id": "55095584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55095584", "title": "Vili people", "text": "Vili people\n\nThe Vili people are Central African ethnic group, established in southwestern Gabon, the Republic of Congo, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It's a subgroup of Bantu and Kongo peoples. The Vili culture is rich in a secular history, a society that is certainly misogynistic but in which the Matriarchy is the foundation. of a Vili language full of nuances where proverbs have a prominent place. of an original measurement system, of a spirituality whose Nkisi, Nkisi Konde or nail fetishes are the famous physical representation.\n\nWith the Yombe, the Lumbu, the Vungu, the Punu and the Kugni, they lived harmoniously within the former Kingdom of Loango. They have even developed with the Kugni, the \"Bundiku\", a good neighborly relationship in order to avoid conflicts.\n\nThe Vili have very early maintained relations of equal to equal with the Westerners, especially in trade. But this contact with the West will soon turn into his disfavor. Triangular trade had certainly enriched a tiny minority of indigenous brokers, but it had above all unbalanced the societal structure of the Vili country. The epidemics of trypanosomiasis, smallpox, the carriage on the back of men had drastically decreased the population of this people.\n\nBut it is mainly French colonization that will accelerate its acculturation, especially when some Vili will want to mime the colonizer and take themselves for whites.\n\nNot having family griots, ignorant of the conquest, the distant past and the stories that accompany it, the Vili culture is doomed to disappear if nothing is done to save what can still be.\n\nDepending on the source and context, there are several forms: Bavili, Bavilis, Fiote, Ivili, Loango, Vilis. The term fiote (\"black\"), used by Portuguese settlers, is now considered pejorative. The term of Vili also refers to their cultures, and traditions.\n\nThey speak the Vili, a Bantu language whose number of speakers was estimated at 50 000 in 2010. Approximately 45 000 were counted in the Republic of Congo and 5 000 in Gabon. The other known names and dialect names are : Civili, Civili ci Loango, Civili ci Moongo, Civili ci Waanda, Civili ci Yombe, Fiot, Fiote, Tshivili, Tsivili. The close ethnic group are: Kotchi, Lindji, Ciyoombe, Woyo, Yombe, Yoombe.\n\nThe Vili, as well as the Yombe (ethnically closest cultural and geographically to Vili people), the Lumbu, the Vungu, the Punu and the Kugni, formed the ethnic components of the ancient kingdom of Loango. There were also intermingling with pygmy populations of the Babenzi, the Binga or Baka.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, the Bawoyo dynasty, which belongs to the mighty Brotherhood of Blacksmiths of the Buvandji, led by Njimbe, and based on an army of warriors, is imposed on the local people on the coast of Loango. According to several sources, such as the English explorer Andrew Battel, present in the region around 1610, the Dutchman Olfert Dapper, as well as the English trader R.E. Dennett, Njimbe would be the founder of the Kingdom of Loango and his first sovereign with a Reign that would have lasted about sixty years. Initially, the province of the Kingdom of Kongo (Kongo Dia Nthotila - \"Kongo of the King\"), the Kingdom of Loango, in the company of the two provinces of Ngoyo and Kakongo, was freed in the sixteenth century and occupied a vast territory ranging from the region of Setté Cama to Gabon, to the current Cabinda to the south, from the Massif of Mayombe to the east to the confines of the Anziku Kingdom and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, where the capital Bwali was located. A proverb clearly illustrates the original community of the three secessionist provinces, as well as the religious role of the king of Ngoyo. This is: \"Makongo Nuni, Mangoyo Nthomi, Maloangu nkasi\" which literally means \"\"the Makongo is the husband, the Mangoyo the priest\" (keeper and officiating of the Tchibila Shrine of the god Bunzi) and the Malwangu the woman\".\n\nThe ruling family was derived from the Vili ethnic group, specifically the Kondi and Nkata clans. This state had a social and political organization with a king, a government and governors of its seven provinces. The strong political prioritization allowed some chroniclers to establish an analogy with the feudal societies of medieval Europe. At the time Loango was already prevalent an elective mechanism, particularly in the designation of the future sovereign.\n\nIn the history of the Kingdom of Loango, there is no visible trace. However, he soon made exchanges with the Europeans, mostly Portuguese, escaped from the bagnes or former ebony traffickers. Germans, Englishmen, Dutch, had opened Factoreries in the vicinity of the larger villages.\n\nIn 1849, in favour of the boarding of the ship slave Brazilian Elizia or Ilizia by the frigate Penelope of the French Navy, some thirty or several hundred slaves Vili, Lumbu, Yaka or Bongo, according to the sources, after a three-year stay in Senegal , were permanently installed in the Komo estuary in the midst of the Mpongwé villages. This incident marked the birth of Libreville, the political capital of Gabon, like Freetown in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe end of the nineteenth century marked the beginning of the decadence of the Kingdom of Loango. The latter suffered the collateral damage of the rivalry of Europeans in Central Africa, notably between the ship Ensign Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza and the explorer Henry Morton Stanley. In order to ensure the unilateral control of the sea front of the Congo and Gabon, France imposes treaties on the traditional authorities.\n\nThe Ma Loango Manimakosso-Tchinkosso, which reigned from 1879 to 1885, weakened by the blockade of the coast established by the Sagittaire ship, preventing any contact between the villages, was forced to capitulate. On 12 March 1883, he signed with ship Lieutenant Robert Cordier, a treaty of sovereignty, trade and disposal of the Territory, in the presence of the Portuguese traders Manuel Saboga and French Ferdinand Pichot. Moreover, the central power of the Ma Loango fades to the benefit of local potentates. Some of them, among them André Moe-Loemba (indigenous raised by the Portuguese missions, founder of the village of Tchimbamba), Mamboma Makosso, Mvumvo Lucieno and Matchimbamba initialled, on 21 June 1883, the Treaty of Punta-Negra, with the same ship Lieutenant Cordier, allowing France to take possession of this territory,\nAt the same time, in the Portuguese-speaking perimeter, two years later, on 25 February 1885, the princes and notables of the kingdoms of Kakongo, Loango and Ngoyo signed with Guillerme Auguste de Brito Capello, commander of the Corvette \"Rainha of Portugal\", the Treaty of Simulambuco that puts them under the protection of the Kingdom of Portugal,\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium signed no less than 289 treaties between 1883 and 1884 in the conquest of the valley of Kouilou-Niari, territory ceded to France at the Berlin conference in 1885. It ratifies all these treaties making France the absolute ruler of the part of Central Africa from the right bank of the Congo River to the confines of Gabon, thus completing the sharing of Africa between the colonial powers. The control of coastal bases also allowed the departure of numerous expeditions which took place to Chad and even Sudan (Fashoda incident).\nLoango, the capital, then houses the Government and the official institutions, managing the internal and external trade. This is the only outlet for the caravan trails to the ocean. At Pointe-Noire, the current economic capital, there are a number of fishing villages such as Bou Mvou-Mvou (Novotel hotel's location on Charles de Gaulle Avenue); - literally Mvoumvou would mean \"what lasts, what is eternal and by extension\" \"M;Bou Mvoumvou\" \"It is the beach, the eternal Sea\"-, M'Boukou (current Mouyondzi District).\n\nThe current peripheral areas of Pointe-Noire at this time are only villages: Loandjili, Siafoumou, Tchimbamba, Mpita, Tchimani ...\nIn 1888, the Vili of Gabon occupied Mayumba and exchanged with the Lumbu located along the Banio Lagoon. These two peoples of the Kongo group understand each other without an interpreter.\n\nKing Lumbu Mayombe Ignondrou, the oldest in the region, commanded the Mayombe, Mayumba and part of Setté Cama. He settles the discussions between the clan leaders Vili and Lumbu.\nThe Vili of Mayumba are commissioned by Goufila, and have emancipated themselves from the Ma Loango. The Vili traders of Loango who went to Setté Cama by the coast, are also often stripped of their bundles of cloths.\n\nIn 1897, the completion of the Matadi-Leopoldville railway, but especially the foundation of Pointe-Noire in 1922, in view of the construction of a deep-water port and a railway line, will precipitate the decline of the Capital Loango. Indeed, its bay with its low draught does not allow the landing of ships for the traffic of persons and goods. Loango then only welcomes the burials of the nobles Vili and the settlers.\nMoreover, the shipyards of the port and the Congo Ocean Railway will push the men in the force of the age to emigrate to Pointe-Noire. Except for the small fishing village of Ndjindji, it is the workers of these two shipyards which will constitute the bulk of the indigenous Pointe-Noire population. The city also sees the arrival of people attracted by the induced jobs. These include traders from Gabon, Dahomey, Togo and Ghana.\n\nThe French colonizers, anxious to avoid conflicts with the natives, reserve the areas of swamps, unfit for agriculture and empty of population. They also recognize customary law: the non-fertile land belongs to the whole community. But this rule is not always respected.\nThus, in 1910, the village Koùmbi Bouilika was removed from the map. Its inhabitants, headed by the chief Louissi Sakala, said the elder son of the patriarch Nfouk'-Lassy, were expelled and expropriated from this land by the will of the settlers in the yardstick of the development of Pointe-Noire. The latter, having not found any suitable sites other than this plateau to build a runway that could accommodate aircraft, have therefore unfortunately relocated to this village which was on the current location of the Agostinho Neto airport of Pointe-Noire. It stretched between the current air base and the Tchinouka River, and was adjacent to the villages of Ntié-Tié, Mboukou, Mpaka, Mpolo, Tchimani, Ngoyo, Tchibambouka, Mpita, Tchinouka, Malala and Tchimbamba.\n\nIn 1924, Hervé Mapako-Gnali, father of Mambou Aimée Gnali and Jean-Félix Tchicaya became the first teachers of the Middle Congo to get out of the William Ponty School on the island of Gorée in Senegal.\nThe need for manpower causes the massive influx of people from the interior (which the natives call Bilanda Lail, \"rail followers\"); Their housing needs contribute to the development of the city. The Vilis, which were hitherto the majority inhabitants of the region, must now share the land and work with the allochthonous populations. They see their habitat area diminishing according to the atomization of the kingdom.\n\nThe Kouilou, in addition to being a land of immigration, is also a land of emigration and expatriation during colonization. The creation of coffee and cocoa plantations in Fernando Po and Sao Tomé, Portage, schooling and the prospect of receiving a salary cause a significant departure from the local labour force towards Brazzaville, Gabon and Ubangi-Shari.\nMoreover, the Vili, as opposed to the Yombe people, are less attached to the land because of their commercial vocation and their positioning as intermediaries between the populations of the hinterland and the European traffickers. All these migratory flows will provoke an important rural exodus, accentuating the ageing and gender imbalance. The continuous depopulation of Bwali, the capital of the former Kingdom of Loango is illustrated.\n\nThe combination of epidemics of smallpox and trypanosomiasis, as well as the use of the test poison (ordeal) to designate the culprits, in particular of suspicious death, also contribute to the decrease in the population of the descendants of the Kingdom of Loango.\n\nFrance came out bled of the Second World War. Through a constituent assembly, it sets up new institutions to revive the country's political activity. The representativeness of France is then extended to the Overseas territories such as the AEF, whose indigenous people have the opportunity to elect representatives. While the old colonies like the West Indies elect their deputies by universal suffrage, the AEF. and AOF have two separate electoral colleges: the first reserved for metropolitan citizens and the second for indigenous, non-citizens. Gabon and the Middle Congo, because of their low population, constitute a single constituency for the election of a Member of Parliament for this second college.\n\nOn 7 December 1945, after a second round, Jean-Félix Tchicaya was elected member of the Assembly, before Jean-Hilaire Aubame, Jacques Opangault, Issembé and François-Moussa Simon respectively. Being born in Libreville, the place of emigration of his father, the tailor Makosso Tchicaya allowed the winner to take over his competitors including the Gabonese candidates. In addition to the fact that he worked in Gabon and developed strong friendships, he received the votes of the Vili and Lumbu of the Ngounie, and of the Ogooué-Maritime. However, the rivalry between the Middle Congo and Gabon, as well as between the Vili and the Mpongwe, the first two ethnicities of the two countries to have been in contact with Western civilization will lead to separation into two separate constituencies.\n\nIn 1946, Jean-Félix Tchicaya, grand slayer of Colonialism at the French National Assembly, where he sits throughout the fourth Republic, founded his party the PPC. (Congolese Progressive Party), close to the French Communist Party, in the company of young executives such as Joseph Pouabou or Robert Stéphane Tchitchelle. The latter, right arm of the founder, will be the main animator of the party in Pointe-Noire and Kouilou. He rallies around him, all the railwaymen of the Congo-Ocean Railway. In 1956, he scrambled with his mentor and joined Abbé Youlou to found the UDDIA (Democratic Union for the Defence of African interests). The latter party, by politically mobilizing the Laris (inhabitants of Pool district and Brazzaville), takes political leadership on the PPC and allows Stéphane Tchitchelle to become the first indigenous mayor of Pointe-Noire. He later held several ministerial positions.\n\nThe Congo-Brazzaville, in these years of decolonization, is considered one of the frontlines of the anti-communist struggle in French speaking Africa area. Paris wants at all costs that the future independent Congo not be held by the \"Reds\", but by a friend political leader. Paris had also initially hoped to make Brazzaville the pivot of French action in Central Africa in the direction of Congo-Kinshasa, because all the plots that were aimed at the former Belgian Congo were passed through Brazzaville.\n\nFrance also anxious to master the aspirations emancipatory in its colonies, uses secret agents such as the Dahomean Antoine Hazoume, masterpiece of the PPC. Then passed to the UDDIA, or the French Secret Service, to approach the Congolese politicians. Hazoume is a French intelligence officer who was treated by Maurice Robert [the chief Africa of the French Secret Service], and he had joined the political team of Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré [chargé de Mission at the General Secretariat for African Affairs]. African heads of state such as Fulbert Youlou, Félix Houphouët-Boigny or Ngarta Tombalbaye made him confiance. It is indeed through its intermediary that France will favour starting from 1956, the victory of Youlou (action on the scale of Congolese territory), to put it on the same footing of equality as its two main rivals Jean-Félix Tchicaya and Jacques Opangault. Then France obtained the accession of Youlou and that of its party in the RDA African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain). (Action at the African level) at the beginning of the year 1958; Thus directly competing with Tchicaya, who then withdrew from the RDA. Finally, France opens to Youlou the gates of a universe normally reserved only for African MPs (action at the French level) in this case at Tchicaya.\n\nThe African Socialist Movement (MSA) by Jacques Opangault, a local offshoot of the French international and working-class Section (SFIO) of Guy Mollet, won the elections of the Territorial Assembly of 1957. This majority does not survive the defection of Georges Yambot, Member of Parliament for the Grand Niari, thereby tipping the leadership of the MSA. To the UDDIA within the Territorial Assembly in November 1958. Bloody riots and vandalism erupted in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, mainly between nationals of the Lari and Mbochi ethnic groups. This troubled period will coincide with the transfer of the capital of the middle Congo from Pointe-Noire to Brazzaville. Thus, part of the administrative, political and economic decisions concerning the city of Pointe-Noire are now taken in Brazzaville.\nThe Post independence destiny of the Vili people is closely linked to the geo-political and economic evolution of the republics of Congo, Democratic Congo, Gabon and Angola.\n\nCabinda was incorporated into the Portuguese colonial Empire, separately from its large neighbour of southern Angola. Indeed, already at that time the two territories were separated by the Congo River.\n\nThe second article of the Treaty of Simulambuco, signed in 1885, is often used as an argument by Cabindis separatists. It states that Portugal must ensure the integrity of the Territories under its protection. The Cabindis celebrated in 2005, the 120th anniversary of this Treaty, to the dismay of the Angolan authorities who consider this treaty to be contrary to the state of fact, making Cabinda an Angolan enclave. This differentiated reading of the Treaty is also at the origin of the age-old conflict between the two Parties.\n\nThe Vili of Gabon are mainly located in Mayumba. This locality, which has about 5000 souls, is the last Gabonese city before accessing the neighbouring Congo border. The region of Mayumba is known for its still unspoiled wilderness, its immense beaches that stretch out of sight, beaten by violent waves and violent currents.This wild side is highlighted by the Mayumba National Park, which covers about 870 square kilometers. It is the protected sanctuary where a wide spectrum of animal and plant species flourishes. They include crocodiles, chimpanzees, gorillas, various monkeys, leopards, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes. It is also a great place to observe different species of birds.\nThe aquatic species are not left with sharks, humpback whales, dolphins and leatherback turtles that come to lay on the beaches. The equatorial forest and the mangroves are home to abundant species of precious trees and plants.\nThe once prosperous city became ghostly. In fact, there is no viable economic sector. The exploitation of wood, which was the pride of Mayumba, was struck by the economic crisis and by the ban on the export of precious wood and logs.\n\nFor export business, only the fishing village of Beninese and Togolese origin serves as a port. Yet the laying of the first stone for the construction of a deep water port dates from 1975, under the chairmanship of Omar Bongo. Until today this work is still not out of the ground and the inhabitants are still waiting, because its viability is not obvious.\n\nThe Vili are established long time in the districts of Libreville: Montagne Sainte, Avenue-de-Cointet, Nombakélé, Petit-Paris, Mont-Boni, Campagne, Glass, Toulon, plein-Niger, Louis.In the 1940s, three of the six great neighborhood leaders, respected, sharing the place of Libreville were Vili: Lamou for Petit-Paris, Loembe for Nombakélé and Loueyi for Toulon-Glass\nDuring the war of 1962, triggered for a goal denied during a match between the national football teams of Gabon (Azingo National) and Congo (Diables rouges), all Gabonese nationals of Congo and vice versa all Congolese of Gabon had been expelled from the two host countries. The Vilis of Libreville, which were few and well identified in the indigenous and Gabonese ethnic strains, were, however, were not disturbed.\n\nThe name of the district ', whose semantics can vary according to the intonation, means:\n\nAh U Kèbè! Dangerous! Attention!\nor: Kéba! Attention, sorry\nor: Kèbe, keep one thing\n\nIn Congo-Brazzaville, abbé Fulbert Youlou led the country to independence which was initialled on 15 August 1960. Stéphane Tchitchellé was a member of the Congolese delegation on 28 July 1960, which signed the agreements, ensuring the transfer of powers from the French authorities to the Congolese authorities. He also became vice President of the Republic. This short-lived euphoria makes way for the takeover of Power by the revolutionary MNR (National Revolution Movement) during the days of 13, 14 and 15 August 1963, which establish the courts of exception and the witch hunt. Personalities like Stéphane Tchitchellé or Victor-Justin Sathoud,for instance were put in prison. The first President of the Supreme Court of the Congo Joseph Pouabou, the director of the Congolese Information agency Abbé Anselme Massouémé, both Vili and native of the Pointe-Noire region and the first Prosecutor of the Republic Lazare Matsocota, originally from the Pool, are abducted and murdered on the night of 14–15 February 1965. Above the horror, the body of Joseph Pouabou was never found. The perpetrators of these crimes have never been identified to date.\nIn 1968, the militarization of the Congolese political landscape began. Progressive soldiers with their heads, Lieutenant Marien Ngouabi and other officers such as Alfred Raoul and Louis Sylvain Goma, all three Saint-Cyriens (Saint-Cyr is a French Military Academy), made their entry into the political scene in favour of a coup. A revolutionary Court of Justice is established. Ngouoniba Nsari and Christophe Moukouéké are the president and vice President respectively.\n\nThe group of \"Mpita\" consisting of three Vili originating in the region of the Kouilou that are, the police officer André Tchicya, the two financial administrators Paul Bouanga and Georges Goma is accused by this Court of Justice of flirting with capitalists and therefore to work against the development and interests of the Congo. They will be acquitted by the same court on 26 September 1969.\n\nStanislas Batchi, former headmaster of the Lycée Chaminade (Drapeau Rouge), was president of the popular court and was dubbed the \"red Prosecutor\". In this capacity, he was instructed to investigate cases involving his friends or accused who claimed the same ethnic identity as him. Thus, by asking Stéphane Tchitchéllé to stand up, the latter, astonished to see him play this role as hangman, reminded him in the Vili language, all the services he had rendered to the Prosecutor and all the times, where he had received him for dinner. Stanislas Batchi replied that he was not in the process of settling a family dispute, but a highly important matter related to the security of the state.This example from the \"Mpita Group\" case shows how to violating the rules of mutual assistance, by using cynicism towards his own, by getting their hands dirty, allegiance to the new political order and safeguarding his Position in the leading core. It is also an illustration of the propensity of Vili to focus on individual success at the expense of the community. This is the exact opposite, with a few exceptions, of the functioning of the Lari and the Kongo peoples of the south part of the Republic of Congo, of the citizens of the Niari Valley, or of the Mbochis of the Cuvette department for whom solidarity is a sacred value.\n\nDuring the Seventies decade, the young country that became the People's Republic of the Congo asked all young foreign-trained executives to return to the fold to accompany its development. Women once confined to the role of reproductive and domestic work, are emancipated and also take part in the development of the country. Thus, politically, Josephine Bouanga was elected president of the revolutionary Union of women of the Congo (URFC) at the end of the 2nd Extraordinary Congress of this Organization held on November 15, 1969. She replaces this function, Céline Claudette Eckomband Yandza.\n\nIn civil society, in the precinct of the Brazzaville courthouse, Agathe Pembellot Mambou, sworn on 11 March 1973. She became the first female magistrate of the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe Kouilou department covers the maritime façade of the Republic of Congo. This territory is occupied mainly on the coastal plain to the West, by the Vili, and in the Mayombe Forest Massif in the east by the Yombe. The Vili and te Yombe languages are mutually intelligible.\n\nThe North is occupied by the Lumbu minorities (bantu Échira) and Pygmy Babongo.\n\nThe Vili are mainly distributed in a triangle formed by the Atlantic coast as a base, going from Madingo-Kayes to the Cabinda border and the locality of Tchikanou on the road to Tchitondi (formerly Holle) as the summit. In addition to those mentioned above, they are found in the villages of Tchilunga, Longo-Bondi, Ntandu Yumbi, Tchissanga, Ntupu, Lendji, Bueti, Hinda, Makola, Bambala, Nanga, Tchivula, Nkumbi, Tangu Mbata, Diosso, Mabindu, Lubu, Mpili and Tchissekeni.\n\nTheir residential area has been gradually reduced due to the atomization of the Kingdom of Loango, for more than one hundred and fifty years, corresponding roughly to the Treaty of Tchimbamba signed on June 21, 1883, allowing France to take possession of the territory. indeed, the French penetration and the brewing of the induced populations, promote the spread of serious epidemics of smallpox and trypanosomiasis (sickness of sleep). The requisition of all men in the force of the age to carry on the back of men, the goods landed at Loango, as well as the use of the test poison to designate the culprits, in particular of suspicious death, will contribute to the decrease of the population of the descendants of the Kingdom of Loango. Drought-induced shortages will push the Vili to move to the Mayombe or to emigrate. They have since kept this soul of travelers.\n\nThe construction of the Congo-Océan railway will decimate the local populations via pneumococcal and dysentery, so that Sara brought back from Chad and Banda from the Ubangi-Shari will be able to complete this voracious project in human lives.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1949, the birth and rise of Pointe-Noire will depopulate the villages of the Hinterland. Schooling and the attraction for the urban lifestyle will accentuate rural loss. From 1962, the number of Vili established in Pointe-Noire exceeds that of those in rural areas. In 1965, the Vili ethnic group was absorbed to almost 60% by the implantation of the city of Pointe-Noire on these lands. More than the others, it has suffered the full brunt of the consequences of urbanization and the distentions of traditional tenure.\n\nIn 1957, the anthropologist Maurice Chabeuf estimated at 36 000, the number of Vili nationals and wondered how this people had not yet disappeared despite all these endured scourges.\n\nNowadays, most of the villages are located along the routes of communication (roads, CFCO).\n\nOutside Pointe-Noire, the economic capital, the population density of the Kouilou is generally very low. From 1.7 hab./km2 to 1984, it rose to 6.8 hab./km2 in 2017. however, there are areas of tension for access to natural resources (hunting and fisheries) and land control, such as the Conkouati Lagoon.\n\nAlthough spared during the civil wars of 1993 and 1997, Pointe-Noire and its hinterland will see a mass flock of migrants from the Pool department and the countries of the Niari. The unsuitable infrastructure still does not allow to this day to absorb this overflow of population. which accentuates land pressure.\n\nSi in Vili language or Tsi in Yombe language refers to inclusive land and its resources, the territory, the country. Members of the matriclan (\"likanda\") have in community land, goods and interests visible and invisible. Clan territory (\"Si likanda\") limits are set by the geniuses, force spirits of the ancestors of the clan (\"nkisi\" in singular and \"bakisi\" if plural) and not by men. These limits may be rivers, hills, edges of forests...\n\nThe ministering spirits prefer quiet places and migrate to more peaceful places, when they are disturbed, thus causing the migration of the clan. The places of residence of the geniuses (\"tchibila\") or sanctuaries are sources, rivers, mountains (Mount Bamba in the Mayombe), circuses (Diosso Gorge), the gorges of Sunda, isolated trees or groves.\n\nThe State grants operating permits to the oil companies (Total, ENI)... and other industrial companies like EFC (Eucalyptus fiber Congo) formerly UAIC (Unit of industrial afforestation of the Congo). Thus, concessions were granted to plant 10,000 ha of eucalyptus around Pointe-Noire, Hinda, Loango Bay and North Bas-Kouilou .\n\nThe State also guarantees every Congolese citizen the possibility to settle anywhere. The motto of the Congolese Party of Labor (PCT), the former single party \"everything for the people and for the people\" served to bail from populations of other regions to settle in the Kouilou. However, authoritarianism and the predominance of the populations of the North to power was favored them in this land game at the expense of the people of the South (Vili and Yombe in mind).\n\nWith the sovereign national conference of 1991, the restoration of the kingdoms of Loango and Anziku (Teke) was followed by a claim of the restoration of the \"ancestral custom\". The holding of this line was none other than François-Xavier Tchitembo, better known under his title of \"Ma Mboma Si Loango\" (Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Loango), Mayor of Bwali (Diosso) even \"Chief Tchitembo\". This last undertook a restoration of the lineal power campaign, including the meeting of July 6, 1994 at Matombi (fishing village). He said that the return to the clan land tenure is a way to regulate the scarcity of game, the decline in the fishery and agricultural resources.\n\nIn order to weigh against the State developer and industrial operators, some people that are part of the regional elite are organized around the regional Association of the earthlings of the Kouilou (ARTK) established in 1992. This institution has allowed clans owners of the land on which the UAIC (plant of industrial afforestation of the Congo) had planted eucalyptus trees, to conduct illicit cut of wood, to get their land back and highlight. Indeed, without consultation with the heads of land, nor farmers who worked there, the administrative authorities have conceded these lands at the UAIC, considering them as unoccupied, while they were left fallow for 5 or 6 years.\n\nWith rampant expansion of the city of Pointe-Noire, the landowners, failing to highlight the territory in a concerted way, just sometimes practice that real estate speculation by selling plots of land to the highest bidder. So on the periphery of the economic capital, the satisfaction of immediate and individual needs takes precedence over the preservation of the heritage of the future and the collective interest.\n\nThe natural resources of the Congolese coastal plain and the outlet is Pointe-Noire, the economic capital, attract immigrants from the four corners of Congolese territory, including the inhabitants of other areas of the Kouloiu.\n\nThus, in the absence of a job employee at Pointe-Noire, migrants engaged in the areas of fishing, agriculture or hunting. Thus, since the sixties, Teke from Ewo and Okoyo district in the Congolese basin (the basin of the Alima), settled in the marshes of the Ntombo and on the shores of lakes and lagoons crossed by the Loeme river to process fishing.\n\nMoreover, the Teke and the Mbamba (Group Kota) from the Massif of the North, in the Lékoumou Department, engaged in hunting in the Massif of the Mayombe where they settled and in the park of Conkouati-Douli. Finally, around and near the pontenegrine settlement, some people from Pool department practice agricultural activities in rural areas.\n\nIn the Kouilou region, who do not have the attributes of sovereignty in the village where he was welcomed, is simply a resident and is called in vili language \"Nthundji\".\n\nOne can be surprised that a civilization as rich as vili culture cannot leave monuments or ruins, testimony of the events of the distant past. This is to forget that in Loango country, you do not build homes or other sustainable buildings using materials. The traditional cabins were made in panels of Papyrus or Aframomum.\n\nThe typology of the villages is indicative of traditional rural life in its historical, socio-cultural and environmental development.\n\nGeneral speaking, the villages are linear and so-called \"villages-routes\", because of their location along the roads. Habitat within the village is more often split or subdivided in the middle of savannah. However, the habitat becomes more consolidated near sites of the rivers, forests and roads.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Richard Edward Dennett, an English merchant who lived and traded in Vili country note \"Fiote, once they have buried a parent, either destroy completely the house of the deceased, or dismantle it to sell the materials to another family \". \" The cassava plants or other fruit trees like orange, lemon and mango are planted instead to avoid anyone to settle there. However, things have changed today. Indeed, the death of a loved one always causes abandonment of the home plot. However, it is only rarely destroyed. This allows the family of the deceased to continue to operate, at least temporarily, the food-producting cultures and fruits that are still there, however without to maintain them.\n\nAccording to beliefs, anyone building a hut with long life materials, is irremediably condemned (death, misfortune, bad spells, fires, diseases...). These beliefs and the fetish so accentuate the fragmentation of the Vili rural landscape, the plots inhabited being continually on the move.\n\nThe dispersion and the movement of Vili rural habitat tell us about the individualistic or independent behaviour of Vili people.\n\nThe tremendous mango trees and groves across the savannas are the witnesses of this permanent transhumance of villages. Their size (height) give an indication of the age of the village.\n\nThis traditional custom may explain why the Vili are so badly housed, fearing by supertition, to be accused of witchcraft in compensation for the construction of a lavish home. This also explains the propensity of the Vili, unlike their neighbors, Yombe, to not be attached to their land.\n\nIn addition to the housing cabins (shelters for the night) and the kitchen huts (places of women), the \"Moandza\" or palaver hut, is the privileged place of meetings, exchanges, rest and craft activities of the masculine. Indeed, this place in which men spend most of their time, is an excellent observation post thanks to its close positioning to the road.\n\nAt the same time, the modest home of Moe Poaty III (crowned Maloango March 18, 1931 until his death on May 3, 1975), built in 1952 by the colonial administration and which he used as his residential Palace, was abandoned for six years. Indeed, none of these successors wanted to settle there.\n\nUnder pressure from the Government, the Royal residence then turned museum that opened, on April 10, 1982, Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard, Minister of High education and, Minister of culture and arts.\n\nIn Pointe-Noire, the second area said illegal out of the ground in the 1950s after the ward \"4 Km\" is called also \"Quartier planches\" (\"Plank ward\"). The Catholic Church of St. Christopher of Mvoumvou, nearby was originally entirely built in white wooden planks. Which sometimes causes the laughingstock of newcomers on Pointe-Noire to the Vili, because they are not aware of this aspect of their culture.\n\nThe town of Pointe-Noire or the Department of Kouilou, the Vili people's settlements still does not have a university, nor other public educational institutions such as high schools, colleges and elementary school. Only private initiatives such as the creation of structures such as \"École supérieure de technologie du littoral (EST-L)\", \"École supérieure de commerce et de gestion\", and \"Université de Loango-Institut supérieur de technologie (UL–IUT)\", mitigate somewhat this situation.\n\nThe Pointe-Noire Grand Market area, the district Number 1 Lumumba and the district Number 2 Mvoumvou, once predominantly inhabited by Vili nationals, have become a preempted sector by Muslim populations, who have come from West Africa, increasingly pushing the Vili to the peripheral districts of the district number 4 Loandjili or 5 Mongo-Poukou. Indeed, impoverishment pushes families to sell their properties in order to survive.\n\nSo far there has been tacit approval between the central government and Pointe-Noire and the Department of Kouilou: Most of the mayors of the coastal city have since independence been most often nationals of this region. For example, Stéphane Tchitchéllé, Dr. Jacques Bouiti, Marcel Tchionvo, Jean-Pierre Thysthère Tchicaya, François-Luc Makosso, Roland Bouiti-Viaudo and the current director-Mayor Jean-François Kando (elected since 28 August 2017), are noted. \nThe fact that the first Lady Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso born Tchibota originates from Pointe-Noire, militates for this status quo. But how long will this agreement last, which the Vili consider their prerogative as descendants of this fief? Indeed, the economic lung of the Congo, as the gateway to and exiting the flow of goods, arouses increasingly heightened lust.\n\nIn September 1988, the site of Diosso gorges or the \"Little Colorado\" of Congo as presented by the tourist guides, one of the most beautiful natural sites to visit the country, was planned to receive toxic waste from Europe. The first shipment from Rotterdam, of the million tonnes of contract valued at US $74 million, fortunately never left the Dutch port.\n\nThis scandal revealed by the \"Green Zorros of Ecology\", and relayed by Radio France Internationale broke out publicly four months ago and involves the businessman Luciano Spada and several personalities at the top of the state of the time: Gilbert Bembet, Minister of Information, Ange Edouard Poungui, Prime Minister, Alphonse Poaty-Souchlaty, Minister of Trade and SMEs, Christophe Mbouramoué, Minister of Scientific Research and environment. are also involved in this montage between Bauwerk A. G, a Liechtenstein company, and the Congolese State of civil society personalities such as Vincent Gomez, business lawyer, Jean Passi, adviser to the Prime Minister, and Dieudonné Nganga, Ngamissamy Issanga, Abel Tschicou, administrative authorities.\n\nThe scandal aroused incessant rumors and terror among the people of the Kouilou where the waste had to be stored. To calm the situation, the Government committed itself to establishing the responsibilities. The two ministers instigating this fraudulent contract, Christian Gilbert Bembet and Christophe Mbouramoué were dismissed, although having already pocketed the bribes even before the execution of the contract. In addition, lawyer Vincent Gomez was disbarred from the Lawyers bar.\n\nMore recently, after feasibility studies in Singapore, the Congo and China have endorsed the construction of a special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Pointe-Noire region, and more specifically to Loango; This is part of the $60 billion financing plan, granted by Beijing to support the industrialization of African countries. If at first it is excellent news for the Congo to have been chosen as a \"pilot\" country, particularly in terms of potential jobs, what will it be for the Kouilou and its nationals? Already expropriation operations began in order to build the future deep-water port in the region of Loango.\n\nThe presence of China also adversely affects the natural environment through its industrial fisheries off the Atlantic coast. Indeed, these trawlers destroy the nets of artisan Vili fishermen, residing in the villages located between the district of Tchiamba-Nzassi and the Gabonese border. These fishermen are forced to abandon their activity in order to fall back on the rural work. As a result, migratory flows to the interior of the land entailing pressure on the forest areas (agricultural activities, wood cutting for coal ...).\n\nThe immense industrial plantations of eucalyptus (originally intended to supply a hypothetical pulp mill) produce wood for export. This indigenous species of the Australian continent hinders the diversification of the undergrowth of the Kouilou region, whose soil is already sandy and poor. It follows a decrease in land reserved for agricultural activities. Active or disadvantaged local populations are forced to abandon artisanal activities and to look for salaried jobs in mining companies. The production of charcoal for cooking, agriculture, hunting and gathering to feed these populations that are urbanizing and whose relationship with their original natural environment fades, are not made to reassure the future of the biodiversity of the region.\n\nThe eruption of the Kingdom of Loango at the end of the nineteenth century fragmented the oil regions between the Cabinda enclave in Angola, Gabon, Congo-Brazzaville and D.R. Congo. The first oil research began in Gabon, in 1928, at the instigation of Governor General Raphaël Antonetti. In 1931, the oil exploration Mission of AEF (MPPAEF) was created, of which Jacques-Olivier Haas took the direction in 1932. The MPPAEF is replaced in 1934 by the Union of Petroleum Studies and Research (SERP), which becomes, in 1949, the oil Company of AEF (SPAEF), which will eventually merge into the ELF group. The ELF company whose prospections began in the 1960 years, discovers the first offshore oil deposits off Pointe-Noire.\n\nDr. Jean-Baptiste Tchicaya, a geologist, is one of several of these expeditions. It is at its initiative that almost all oil fields, barges or drilling rigs still in operation or not off Pointe-Noire, bear the names Vili. These are names reminiscent of fish or seafood from the Atlantic Ocean of the Tropics:\n\nAs soon as it was created in 1967, the French company Elf, which became Total thereafter, is immediately above the law and depends on the right line of the \"Élysée\" Palace. To compensate for the loss of Algeria, which provided before its independence a quarter of its energy needs, France Gaullist considers as vital and strategic to explore and exploit oil fields in Sub-Saharian Africa. All means are good to achieve this goal.\n\nFormer officers of the SDECE (French Secret Services Agency) will be a cohort of private secret Service agents, in order to effectively ensure the safety of oil installations and men. Colossal financial means (occult commissions, corruption, opaque circuits, etc.) are put into play to finance the operating costs of governments, to intervene in the appointment of senior officials or in the distribution of under the counter payment.\n\nIn the western unconscious, Congo remains the quintessential playground for \"spooks\". After financing the presidential campaign of Pascal Lissouba in 1992, Elf refuses to advance the funds to pay the most immediate public officials and expenditure. Lissouba then turns to the American oil tanker Occidental Petroleum. The relations between the President and Elf will then deteriorate, with the civil Wars of 1993 and 1997 as a climax. Elf prefers to deal with President Denis Sassou Nguesso, a political and pragmatic end, first as soon as he ascended to power on February 5, 1979, then at the end of his coup de force in the Civil War of 1997, thus ending the parenthesis six years after the 1991 national conference.\n\nThus, Elf did not hesitate to finance and arm the two camps in presence in order to safeguard its interests.\n\nPointe-Noire, the economic capital of the Congo, sees hundreds of thousands of refugees coming from the Pool area and the Niari Valley. Successive waves are sometimes anarchy settled by ethnic groups with an obvious risk of igniting on a tribal basis. So far, Pointe-Noire has always been preserved from the political turmoil of which the Congo is the prerogative. Colonel Louis Georges Loembé, Head of Pointe-Noire military zone N°1, and François Auguste Tchichellé Tchivéla, son of Stéphane Tchitchéllé, senior officer and pediatrician, Minister of Tourism and Environment from 1992 to 1995, under Pascal Lissouba rule, prefect of Kouilou department during the Civil war that broke out in 1997, because they were Military, originating in the region, will ensure that the conflict does not affect the ocean City.\n\nThe Congo has important oil reserves but remains one of the poorest countries and one of the most indebted countries in the world per capita, despite the cancellation by international institutions of half of its debt, benefiting in 2010 of the HIPC regime (heavily indebted poor countries). Meanwhile, the oil windfall extracted from Pointe-Noire does not benefit this one. The infrastructure does not follow the rapid evolution of the population of the coastal city. Investment work (access to drinking water, energy, sanitation, management of industrial and domestic waste ...) and maintenance (collection and treatment of waste, pollution, noise and visual nuisances, non-existent ...) are made sparingly. The few subsidies allocated disappear into the meanders of the obscure networks.\n\nSince the years 1970, the beginning of the oil sands operation in the vicinity of the localities of Mboukou, Tchikanou, Loango first by the oil company SPAEF became later ELF, then by Maurel and Prom, and finally by ENI (formerly AGIP research), it could have been expected that the living conditions of the populations improved. It is rather the disillusionment, because no road, nor sanitary and school infrastructure worthy of the name has emerged. These populations whose main activities are fishing, harvesting and agriculture have seen their area of activity polluted by the different boreholes, making their living conditions unbearable. In addition to the decline in agricultural yields (cassava, yams, plantains) that allow Pointe-Noire to be supplied, water points have also been polluted making water unfit for food use. ENI's only solution is to supply water by tanker trucks whose vats are not always curated. Even this distribution is done at the head of the customer by favoring those who have relationships or money.\n\nIn order to carry out this extraction work, peasants have seen their fields destroyed and compensated by ENI in 2009 with a scale dating from 1986. For example, a field of 10 hectares was compensated at a level of 150 000 CFA francs (or approximately EUR 230), a cassava cutting was offset at 37 CFA francs (0.05 euro), one foot of mango tree at 60 000 CFA francs (about 90 euros).\n\nThere are also the torchieres of oil sites like that of M'Boundji that produce greenhouse gases and heavy trucks that by transporting equipment (pipelines) raise dust on their way causing diseases Lung.\n\nIt all happens as if you want to kill softly local people.\n\nPierre Stève Loemba, peasant and spokesperson for the communities of Mboukou explains: After many arguments without results, we have entrusted our problem to human rights associations to help us to conquer our right to \"A decent life, a healthy environment and fairness.\"\n\nBrice Makosso, president of the Justice and Peace Commission, believes that \"instead of brandishing the decree of 1986, all these companies should instead refer to international standards that are superior to local standards.\" In Chad or Cameroon, the scales have been revised.\n\nThe global oil sector has been in crisis and in full mutation since the oil barrel stagnated around US $50 and the demand for black gold is declining sharply.\nThis affects the Congolese economy, which is largely dependent on its oil exports. All the oil majors operating in the country and all their major sub-contractors reduced the sail by returning their cohort of expatriates to the house. Employees with local status have a less-than-shiny spell. Some were thanked overnight without any compensation. Other majors want to reduce the benefits that have been acquired by nationals; What makes the teeth cringe or even causes strikes.\n\nAs Paul Boateng, a British politician, stresses, \"a crisis presents both problems and opportunities.\" The opportunity is to be part of the solution: This industry can create well-paid jobs, benefiting both the shareholders and the companies in which it intervenes. To do this, we need to develop local purchasing policies and local content.\n\nLocal content or national preference is to \"ensure a rebalancing of wealth by inviting States to capitalize on their natural resources\". Apart from the taxes and income received by the host States, it is an excellent instrument for the use of local industrial fabric and local competences, not only in the extractive economy sector (hydrocarbons, mines, forest industry), But also in the service and construction sector. So it is a direct impact on the national economy.\n\nThe tools available to the public authorities are as follows: imposing the use of local employment; Job creation and transfer of skills; Oblige foreign companies to open their shareholdings to national actors; Demand that they be provided locally in goods and services, in order to densify the Small and medium-sized enterprises network...\n\nAt the scale of the village communities that live in the sites operated by these oil majors, they would have to organize themselves into structures capable of serving as interlocutors with the public authorities and the oil companies, for example Train young people to work on these sites or offshore areas, design and implement sustainable development projects to preserve the natural environment and produce (agriculture, fish farming, livestock farming ...) to supply the large Pointe-Noire agglomeration.\n\nThe Niigeria inspired by the Norwegian and Brazilian models is the sub-saharan country to have pushed the concept of local content further through the promulgation of the Nigerian content Act in April 2010. This concept is relatively new in Congo with the publication of the new hydrocarbons code in October 2016. As long as it benefits a little to the local communities. One can be doubtfully, since these laws on the local content, have never been followed by a support system so that national staff or national enterprises can confront themselves with their foreign competitors with equal arms.\n\nBut as Ines Féviliyé says, the crisis is the opportunity to implement the rules of local content, in information, awareness, dialogue. Indeed, all stakeholders are gaining, by reducing costs for private companies, new markets for local suppliers, transferring technology to develop the domestic industry, jobs, reducing unemployment and of poverty.\n\nThe task is certainly not easy, but it is no longer a question of shirking it, given the current situation.\n\nThe Vili traditional society as well as all the ethnic groups of the Kongo group, is characterized by a main structure called Likanda. This is the clan whose members possess in community and in common the goods and interests visible and invisible. Within this matrilineal society, the territory of the clan (si likanda) as well as its limits are managed by the elder of the maternal uncles (ma Nkashi or Fumu si). The word SI in expressions si likanda or Fumu si designates both the land on which the clan is established, but also all the resources therein.\n\nThe terms and phrases used to distinguish kinship links are as follows:\n\nWhen an elder meets a younger stranger, after the greetings, the first asks the second on the name of his clan, then on that of his parents, saying: \"\"Ndjé mwan ' na?\" \" (literally \"From whom are you the child? \" which can be translated as \" What are your origins? \"). It's a way to know a little more about who we're dealing with. The youngest describes then more or less succinctly his family tree.\n\nTraditionally and prior to western penetration, members of Liziku, the nuclear family, did not have the same name. For instance, a child could bear the name of a grandparent (N'Luku) or another family member. This becomes the godfather or godmother (N'dusi) of the child. One can also give the surname of a grandparent leaning on the father's.\n\nThe name is said Li Zina (Me zina in the plural), while the first name or pseudonym is said to be Nkumbu (Si Nkumbu in plural).\n\nMembers of the royal or princely clans are easily identifiable by the presence of the Mwé or Moé honorary particle in front of the surname. This title of nobility can be translated by Lord or my lord.\n\nThe Ma Loango (king), his brothers and sisters are \"Moé\". His nephews and nieces (Bana bu nkashi) from her uterine sisters are also.\n\nOn the contrary, the King's Wife (Kame Fumu or by contraction Ka fu) is not \"Moé\". Ditto for the Children of the King (Bane Fumu, Mwane fumu in the singular or by contraction Mwa fu).\n\nCan claim or accede to the throne only the holders of the title of Moé, because of the matrilineal succession (power derived from the royal Blood).\n\nBelow are some surname and their meaning.\n\nBalou (\"severe\"; the name of a Portuguese settler Barros very severe) - Bambi/Mbambi (Iguana) - Batchi/Mbatchi (\"possess me\", \"caught up with me\", \"what belongs to you\"; of the verb \"mbak\" meaning to possess, \"to catch\") - Bilindji - Bouiti (\"Master\") - Boutali - Djembo (\"struggle with\", \"provoking quarrels\") - Djimbi - Gnali - Goma/Ngoma (\"drum, percussion musical instrument\") - Guimbi - Katane (\"leaves\") - Kutana (\"competing, compete\") - Lassy - Lende - Lianzi (\"name of sea fish, fisherman\") - Likounzi/Tchikounzi (\"Pillar\") - Limeka-Linka (\"the other problem\") - Loemba/Loembe (\"landlord\") - Loendo - Louang ' (\"the little herb that cures\") - Loubendou - Louviloukou - Loussiemo (\"Lightning\") - Louzimbou (\"ingratitude\") - Louzingou (\"Life\") - Louzol ' (\"Love\") - Mabiala (\"Madness, elected, selected\") - Makala (\"Coal/energy\") - Makani - Makaya (\"leaves\") - Makosso (plural of \"likosso\"; \"comments, eye drops, solution obtained by mashing by hand unidentified leaves and administered in the nostrils with a funnel made from leaves, arguments\") - Malalou - Malassy - Mambou/Liambou/Tchimambou (\"case (s), amazement, admiration, many\") - Mangafou/Mangofo (\"Minister of Health of the Government of the Kingdom of Loango/Minister of Foreign Affairs and Introducer of Foreigners at the court of the Kingdom of Kakongo-1776\") - Manka (\"other situations\") - Mapakou - Matakou (\"buttock\") - Matchiela - Matouti - Mavoungou (plural Muvungu, \"bedding covers\") - Mbouakissi - Mbouyou/Bouyou - Mfoumou/Foumou (\"chief, leader\") - Moutou/Bantou/Tchimoutou (\"person (s)\") - Mpaka/Paka (\"fence, doubt, uncertainty\") - Mpili (\"Viper\") - Munuel (\"informant\") - Ngang Lyel (\"educated, erudite\") - Ngang' Vumba (\"the one who broods\") - Ngô (\"leopard)\" - Ngulungu (\"Pain\") - Ngulubu (\"wild boar\") - Nguli Mbwiti (\"Grand Master, great fetishist\") - Niambi (\"complaint\") - Nkali - Nkouanga - Nkoussou (\"Parrot\") - Nkunta/Ntetchi (\"Basket\") - Nombo - Ntenda (\"sound of rifle shot translated in Tendart\") - Nzaou (\"Elephant\") - Nzassi (\"Lightning\") - Nzenze (\"cricket\") - Nziami - Pango/Pangou - Pambou (\"ability, bell\") - Panzou - Pakassa (\"Buffalo\") - Pembello (\"clean air\") - Poati (hold me, live all my being) - Poba - Sakala - Sitou - Souami - Souchlaty (\"hold me, inhabit my whole being\") - Soumbou - Ta Lounga (\"we were right\") - Tam ' Si (\"deals with the affairs of the country\") - Ta Tounga (\"we have built\") - Tati - Tchiama/Untchiama (\"Rainbow\") - Tchibota -Tchicaya (\"diminutive of Tchikakati; thing from the inside, placenta\") - Tchinianga -Tchilala - Tchilimbou (\"flag, victory, indelible europeanised mark in Sinald\") - Tchimbakala (\"young man\") - Tchiloumbou (\"the day\") - Tchingoundou - Tchissafou (\"safou\") - Tchissambou - Tchissina (\"wealthy\") - Tchitembo - Tchivanga - Tchivéla (\"thunder\") - Tchiyembi (\"poverty\") - Téléman (\"hope, arise\") - Viodu/Li Viodu/Viaudo (\"Sparrow, Unlucky, bad eye\").\n\nBelow are some surname and their meaning.\n\nBossa - Bilongo - Bouhoussou - Boumba (\"moon halo\") - Bwindji - Fotcheko - Foutou - Labline/Bwine - Landou - Lelo - Lembi - Lihaou (\"it is that\") - Li Mani (\"stone\") - Lissahou - Louangou - Losso - Malila - Malonda - Massanga - Matchiela - Mikemo - Mouissou - Mpakou - Mpemba/Pemba (\"Virginity, Virgin\") - Mpouna - Mudeleto - Mulikigni - Ndola - Ndoulou - Ngouamba (\"famine\") - Niandji - Niantou - Niefno (\"beauty\") - Niendo - Ninga - Niong' (\"Regrets\") - Nkambisi/Tchikambsi (\"mermaid, Mamy Wata, the Genius of Water\") - Nsangou - Ntoulou - Nyissi - Nzinga -Simbou (\"Earth and Ocean\") - Socko - Souaka (\"kou souek - to hide)\" - Soungou - Tchibinda (\"proof\") - Tchifou -Tchifoumba (\"family\") - Tchilambou - Tchiniongo - Tchingombi/Ngombi - Tchissafou (\"Safou, Safou tree - dacryodes edulis\") - Tchissimbou (\"something we hold\") - Tchitoula (\"The most beautiful woman of a country\") - Toukoula (\"powder based on Padouk roots\") - Volo (\"Sweet\") - Voumbi (\"mortal remains\") - Wola (\"gold as precious metal\") - Yala - Yessa - Zole (\"Love\") - Zouina.\n\nBouanga / Tchibouanga (\"weaver, cloth\") - Mpopi (\"Holy\") - Panzou - Tchizinga (\"surround, to have a long life\") - Yanzi (\"angel\")\n\nThe following combinations are often used:\n\nConsecrated names give information on the circumstances of the birth of the children bearing these names.\n\nFuti (\"born just after the twins, he would present according to tradition excellent skills to succeed\") - Nguli Bassa (\"mother of twins.

{"id": "148351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148351", "title": "William Styron", "text": "William Styron\n\nWilliam Clark Styron Jr. (June 11, 1925 – November 1, 2006) was an American novelist and essayist who won major literary awards for his work.\n\nStyron was best known for his novels, including:\n\nIn 1985, he suffered from his first serious bout with depression. Once he recovered from his illness, Styron was able to write the memoir \"Darkness Visible\" (1990), the work he became best known for during the last two decades of his life.\n\nStyron was born in the Hilton Village historic district of Newport News, Virginia, the son of Pauline Margaret (Abraham) and William Clark Styron. He grew up in the South and was steeped in its history. His birthplace was less than a hundred miles from the site of Nat Turner’s slave rebellion, later the source for Styron's most famous and controversial novel.\n\nStyron's Northern mother and liberal Southern father gave him a broad perspective on race relations. Styron’s childhood was a difficult one. His father, a shipyard engineer, suffered from clinical depression, which Styron himself would later experience. His mother died from breast cancer in 1939 when Styron was still a boy, following her decade-long battle with the disease.\n\nStyron attended public school in Warwick County, first at Hilton School and then at Morrison High School (now known as Warwick High School) for two years, until his father sent him to Christchurch School, an Episcopal college-preparatory school in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Styron once said, \"But of all the schools I attended...only Christchurch ever commanded something more than mere respect—which is to say, my true and abiding affection.\"\n\nUpon graduation, Styron enrolled in Davidson College and joined Phi Delta Theta. By the age of eighteen he was reading the writers who would have a lasting influence on his vocation as a novelist and writer, especially Thomas Wolfe. Styron transferred to Duke University in 1943 as a part of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps V-12 program aimed at fast-tracking officer candidates by enrolling them simultaneously in basic training and bachelor's degree programs. There he published his first fiction, a short story heavily influenced by William Faulkner, in an anthology of student work . Styron published several short stories in the University literary magazine, \"The Archive\", between 1944 and 1946. Though Styron was made a lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, the Japanese surrendered before his ship left San Francisco. After the war, he returned to full-time studies at Duke and completed his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in English in 1947.\n\nAfter graduation, Styron took an editing position with McGraw-Hill in New York City. Styron later recalled the misery of this work in an autobiographical passage of \"Sophie’s Choice\". After provoking his employers into firing him, he set about writing his first novel in earnest. Three years later, he published the novel, \"Lie Down in Darkness\" (1951), the story of a dysfunctional Virginia family. The novel received overwhelming critical acclaim. For this novel, Styron received the prestigious Rome Prize, awarded by the American Academy in Rome and the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nHis recall into the military due to the Korean War prevented him from immediately accepting the Rome Prize. Styron joined the Marine Corps, but was discharged in 1952 for eye problems. However, he was to transform his experience at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina into his short novel, \"The Long March\", published serially the following year. This was adapted for the Playhouse 90 episode \"The Long March\" in 1958.\n\nStyron spent an extended period in Europe. In Paris, he became friends with writers Romain Gary, George Plimpton, Peter Matthiessen, James Baldwin, James Jones and Irwin Shaw, among others. In 1953, the group founded the magazine \"Paris Review\", which became a celebrated literary journal.\n\nThe year 1953 was eventful for Styron in another way. Finally able to take advantage of his Rome Prize, he traveled to Italy, where he became friends with Truman Capote. At the American Academy, he renewed an acquaintance with a young Baltimore poet, Rose Burgunder, to whom he had been introduced the previous fall at Johns Hopkins University. They were married in Rome in the spring of 1953.\n\nSome of Styron’s experiences during this period inspired his third published book \"Set This House on Fire\" (1960), a novel about intellectual American expatriates on the Amalfi coast of Italy. The novel received mixed reviews in the United States, although its publisher considered it successful in terms of sales. In Europe its translation into French achieved best-seller status, far outselling the American edition.\n\nStyron's next two novels, published between 1967 and 1979, sparked much controversy. Feeling wounded by his first truly harsh reviews , for \"Set This House on Fire\", Styron spent the years after its publication researching and writing his next novel, the fictitious memoirs of the historical Nathaniel \"Nat\" Turner, a slave who led a slave rebellion in 1831.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Styron became an eyewitness to another time of rebellion in the United States, living and writing at the heart of that turbulent decade, a time highlighted by the counterculture revolution with its political struggle, civil unrest, and racial tension. The public response to this social upheaval was furious and intense: battle lines were being drawn. In 1968, Styron signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, a vow refusing to pay taxes as a protest against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn this atmosphere of dissent, many had criticized Styron's friend James Baldwin for his novel \"Another Country\", published in 1962. Among the criticisms was outrage over a black author choosing a white woman as the protagonist in a story that tells of her involvement with a black man. Baldwin was Styron's house guest for several months following the critical storm generated by \"Another Country\". During that time, he read early drafts of Styron's new novel, and predicted that Styron's book would face even harsher scrutiny than \"Another Country\". \"Bill's going to catch it from both sides,\" he told an interviewer immediately following the 1967 publication of \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\".\n\nBaldwin's prediction was correct, and despite public defenses of Styron by leading artists of the time, including Baldwin and Ralph Ellison, numerous other black critics reviled Styron's portrayal of Turner as racist stereotyping. The historian and critic John Henrik Clarke edited and contributed to a polemical anthology, \"William Styron's Nat Turner: Ten Black Writers Respond\", published in 1968 by Beacon Press. Particularly controversial was a passage in which Turner fantasizes about raping a white woman. Styron also writes of a situation where Turner and another slave boy have a homosexual encounter while alone in the woods. Several critics pointed to this as a dangerous perpetuation of a traditional Southern justification for lynching. Despite the controversy, the novel was a runaway critical and financial success, and won both the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the William Dean Howells Medal in 1970.\n\nStyron's next novel, \"Sophie's Choice\" (1979),\nalso generated significant controversy, in part due to Styron's decision to portray a non-Jewish victim of the Holocaust and in part due to its explicit sexuality and profanity. It was banned in South Africa, censored in the Soviet Union, and banned in Poland for \"its unflinching portrait of Polish anti-Semitism\" It has also been banned in some high schools in the United States.\n\nThe novel tells the story of Sophie (a Polish Roman Catholic who survived Auschwitz), Nathan (her brilliant Jewish lover who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia), and Stingo (a Southern transplant in post-World War II-Brooklyn who was in love with Sophie). It won the 1980 National Book Award\nand was a nationwide bestseller. A 1982 film version was nominated for five Academy Awards, with Meryl Streep winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Sophie. Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol played Nathan and Stingo, respectively.\n\nStyron's readership expanded with the publication of \"Darkness Visible\" in 1990. This memoir, which began as a magazine article, chronicles the author's descent into depression and his near-fatal night of \"despair beyond despair\". It is a first-hand account of a major depressive episode and challenged the modern taboo on acknowledging such issues. The memoir's goals included increasing knowledge and decreasing stigmatization of major depressive disorders and suicide. It explored the phenomenology of the disease among sufferers, their loved ones, and the general public as well. Earlier, in December 1989, Styron had written an op-ed for \"The New York Times\" responding to the disappointment and mystification among scholars about the apparent suicide of Primo Levi, the remarkable Italian writer who survived the Nazi death camps, but apparently fell victim to depression in his final years. Reportedly, it was the public's unsympathetic response to Levi's death that impelled Styron to take a more active role as an advocate for educating the public about the nature of depression, about which he was a dilettante, and the role it allegedly played in mental health and suicide. Styron noted in an article for \"Vanity Fair\" that \"the pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in many instances because its anguish can no longer be borne. The prevention of many suicides will continue to be hindered until there is a general awareness of the nature of this pain. Through the healing process of time—and through medical intervention or hospitalization in many cases—most people survive depression, which may be its only blessing; but to the tragic legion who are compelled to destroy themselves there should be no more reproof attached than to the victims of terminal cancer.\"\n\nStyron was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates.\n\nStyron was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca in 1985.\n\nHis short story \"Shadrach\" was filmed in 1998, under the same title. It was co-directed by his daughter Susanna Styron.\n\nOther works published during his lifetime include the play \"In the Clap Shack\" (1973), and a collection of his nonfiction, \"This Quiet Dust\" (1982).\n\nFrench President François Mitterrand invited Styron to his first Presidential inauguration, and later made him a Commander of the Legion of Honor. In 1993, Styron was awarded the National Medal of Arts.\n\nIn 2002 an opera by Nicholas Maw based on \"Sophie's Choice\" premièred at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. Maw wrote the libretto and composed the music. He had approached Styron about writing the libretto, but Styron declined. Later the opera received a new production by stage director Markus Bothe at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Volksoper Wien, and had its North American premiere at the Washington National Opera in October 2006.\n\nA collection of Styron's papers and records is housed at the Rubenstein Library, Duke University.\n\nIn 1996 William Styron received the 1st Fitzgerald Award on the centenary of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s birth. The F. Scott Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature award is given annually in Rockville Maryland, the city where Fitzgerald, his wife, and his daughter are buried, as part of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Festival.\n\nThe Port Warwick neighborhood of Newport News, Virginia, was named after the fictional city in Styron's \"Lie Down in Darkness\". The neighborhood describes itself as a \"mixed-use new urbanism development.\" The most prominent feature of Port Warwick is William Styron Square along with its two main boulevards, Loftis Boulevard and Nat Turner Boulevard, named after characters in Styron's novels. Styron himself was appointed to design a naming system for Port Warwick, deciding to \"honor great American writers\", resulting in Philip Roth Street, Thomas Wolfe Street, Flannery O'Connor Street, Herman Melville Avenue and others.\n\nStyron died from pneumonia on November 1, 2006, at age 81 in Martha's Vineyard. He is buried at West Chop Cemetery in Vineyard Haven, Dukes County, Massachusetts.\n\nWhile doing a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome, Styron renewed a passing acquaintance with young Baltimore poet Rose Burgunder. They married in Rome in the spring of 1953. Together, they had four children: daughter Susanna Styron is a film director; daughter Paola is an internationally acclaimed modern dancer; daughter Alexandra is a writer, known for the 2001 novel \"All The Finest Girls\" and 2011 memoir \"Reading My Father: A Memoir\"; son Thomas is a professor of clinical psychology at Yale University.\n\nNote - the following is a list of the first American editions of Styron's books\n\n\n"}
