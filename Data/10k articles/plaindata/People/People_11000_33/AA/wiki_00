{"id": "164644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164644", "title": "Albert Ghiorso", "text": "Albert Ghiorso\n\nAlbert Ghiorso (July 15, 1915 – December 26, 2010) was an American nuclear scientist and co-discoverer of a record 12 chemical elements on the periodic table. His research career spanned five decades, from the early 1940s to the late 1990s.\n\nGhiorso was born in California on July 15, 1915, of Italian and Spanish ancestry. He grew up in Alameda, California. As a teenager, he built radio circuitry and earned a reputation for establishing radio contacts at distances that outdid the military.\n\nHe received his BS in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1937. After graduation, he worked for Reginald Tibbets, a prominent amateur radio operator who operated a business supplying radiation detectors to the government. Ghiorso's ability to develop and produce these instruments, as well as a variety of electronic tasks, brought him into contact with the nuclear scientists at the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, in particular Glenn Seaborg. During a job in which he was to install an intercom at the lab, he met two secretaries, one of whom married Seaborg. The other, Wilma Belt, became Albert's wife of 60+ years.\n\nGhiorso was raised in a devout Christian family, but later left the religion and became an atheist. However, he still identified with Christian ethics.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Seaborg moved to Chicago to work on the Manhattan Project. He invited Ghiorso to join him, and for the next four years Ghiorso developed sensitive instruments for detecting the radiation associated with nuclear decay, including spontaneous fission. One of Ghiorso's breakthrough instruments was a 48-channel pulse height analyzer, which enabled him to identify the energy, and therefore the source, of the radiation. During this time they discovered two new elements (95, americium and 96, curium), although publication was withheld until after the war.\n\nAfter the war, Seaborg and Ghiorso returned to Berkeley, where they and colleagues used the 60\" Crocker cyclotron to produce elements of increasing atomic number by bombarding exotic targets with helium ions. In experiments during 1949-1950, they produced and identified elements 97 (berkelium) and 98 (californium). In 1953, in a collaboration with Argonne Lab, Ghiorso and collaborators sought and found elements 99 (einsteinium) and 100 (fermium), identified by their characteristic radiation in dust collected by airplanes from the first thermonuclear explosion (the Mike test). In 1955, the group used the cyclotron to produce 17 atoms of element 101 (mendelevium), the first new element to be discovered atom-by-atom. The recoil technique invented by Ghiorso was crucial to obtaining an identifiable signal from individual atoms of the new element.\n\nIn the mid-1950s it became clear that to extend the periodic chart any further, a new accelerator would be needed, and the Berkeley Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC) was built, with Ghiorso in charge. That machine was used in the discovery of elements 102-106 (102, nobelium; 103, lawrencium; 104, rutherfordium; 105, dubnium and 106, seaborgium), each produced and identified on the basis of only a few atoms. The discovery of each successive element was made possible by the development of innovative techniques in robotic target handling, fast chemistry, efficient radiation detectors, and computer data processing. The 1972 upgrade of the HILAC to the superHILAC provided higher intensity ion beams, which was crucial to producing enough new atoms to enable detection of element 106.\n\nWith increasing atomic number, the experimental difficulties of producing and identifying a new element increase significantly. In the 1970s and 1980s, resources for new element research at Berkeley were diminishing, but the GSI laboratory at Darmstadt, Germany, under the leadership of Peter Armbruster and with considerable resources, was able to produce and identify elements 107-109 (107, bohrium; 108, hassium and 109, meitnerium). In the early 1990s, the Berkeley and Darmstadt groups made a collaborative attempt to create element 110. Experiments at Berkeley were unsuccessful, but eventually elements 110-112 (110, darmstadtium; 111, roentgenium and 112, copernicium) were identified at the Darmstadt laboratory. Subsequent work at the JINR laboratory at Dubna, led by Yuri Oganessian and a Russian-American team of scientists, was successful in identifying elements 113-118 (113, nihonium; 114, flerovium; 115, moscovium; 116, livermorium; 117, tennessine and 118, oganesson), thereby completing the seventh row of the periodic table of the elements.\n\nGhiorso invented numerous techniques and machines for isolating and identifying heavy elements atom-by-atom. He is generally credited with implementing the multichannel analyzer and the technique of recoil to isolate reaction products, although both of these were significant extensions of previously understood concepts. His concept for a new type of accelerator, the Omnitron, is acknowledged to have been a brilliant advance that probably would have enabled the Berkeley lab to discover numerous additional new elements, but the machine was never built, a victim of the evolving political landscape of the 1970s in the U.S. that de-emphasized basic nuclear research and greatly expanded research on environmental, health, and safety issues. Partially as a result of the failure to build the Omnitron, Ghiorso (together with colleagues Bob Main and others) conceived the joining of the HILAC and the Bevatron, which he called the Bevalac. This combination machine, an ungainly articulation across the steep slope at the Rad Lab, provided heavy ions at GeV energies, thereby enabling development of two new fields of research: \"high-energy nuclear physics,\" meaning that the compound nucleus is sufficiently hot to exhibit collective dynamical effects, and heavy ion therapy, in which high-energy ions are used to irradiate tumors in cancer patients. Both of these fields have expanded into activities in many laboratories and clinics worldwide.\n\nIn his later years, Ghiorso continued research toward finding superheavy elements, fusion energy, and innovative electron beam sources. He was a non-participating co-author of the experiments in 1999 that gave evidence of elements 116 and 118, which later turned out to be a case of scientific fraud perpetrated by the first author, Victor Ninov. He also had brief research interests in the free quark experiment of William Fairbank of Stanford, in the discovery of element 43, the electron disk accelerator, among others.\n\nAlbert Ghiorso is credited with having co-discovered the following elements\n\nGhiorso personally selected some of the names recommended by his group for the new elements. His original name for element 105 (hahnium) was changed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to dubnium, to recognize the contributions of the laboratory at Dubna, Russia, in the search for trans-fermium elements. His recommendation for element 106, seaborgium, was accepted only after extensive debate about naming an element after a living person. In 1999, evidence for two superheavy elements (element 116 and element 118) was published by a group in Berkeley. The discovery group intended to propose the name \"ghiorsium\" for element 118, but eventually the data were found to have been tampered and in 2002 the claims were withdrawn. Ghiorso's lifetime output comprised about 170 technical papers, most published in The Physical Review.\n\nGhiorso is famous among his colleagues for his endless stream of creative \"doodles,\" which define an art form suggestive of fractals. He also developed a state-of-the-art camera for birdwatching, and was a constant supporter of environmental causes and organizations.\n\nSeveral obituaries are available online, and a full-length biography is in preparation.\n\n"}

The duke, who had served with great distinction during the Seven Years' War, and was a field-marshal in the Austrian army, originally intended Prince Auguste for the same service, in which, indeed, he began his career at the age of fifteen; but family circumstances altered his career.\n\nLouis Engelbert, Comte de La Marck, the last of his name, and the father-in-law of Charles, 5th Duke of Arenberg, was the officer of a regiment of German infantry in the service of France, and, having no son, proposed that Prince Auguste should enter the French service, offering, if he did so, to give him his regiment. The proposition was accepted, and it was further arranged that on the death of his maternal grandfather, the young prince should take the title of Comte de La Marck, by which he subsequently became known. \n\nThe family of Arenberg had constantly borne arms in the Austrian army, but belonged to a sovereign house, they were free to take service wherever they pleased; the Duke d'Arenberg, however, who stood high in the estimation of the Empress-Queen, Maria Theresa, judged it advisable to obtain her consent to this change in the career of his son. The request was made at the very moment when the marriage was decided on between the Archduchess Marie Antoinette and the Dauphin of France; and the empress, in acceding to it, strongly recommended the Prince of Arenberg to her daughter. He was accordingly presented in due form to Louis XV, assisted at all the fêtes which were given on the occasion of the marriage, was warmly welcomed by the dauphine, and honored by a kindness and confidence never afterwards withdrawn. Consequently, La Marck was a zealous defender of Marie Antoinette, whom he endeavored to represent as much less disposed towards political interference—until the gravity of events compelled her to interfere—than she has often described during his later life.\n\nAfter being thus presented, Prince Auguste joined his regiment in the South of France, remained with it for a year to learn his duty, and then, at the age of 20, returned to court, where, having succeeded to his grandfather's title, and being invested with the rank of Grandee of Spain, he enjoyed every facility for establishing a political and social connection of the highest kind.\n\nMarck distinguishing himself in India fighting under Count de Bussy, and from whence he returned severely wounded. On his return he was involved in a duel in Paris with a former young Swedish officer of his regiment, called M. Peyron. Marck and Peyron had exchanged words before Marck's regiment had embarked for India when Peyron had resigned his commission. They fought with swords, and after a few passes M. Peyron fell dead, having received a sword thrust through an eye. The Count perceived at the same moment that he also was wounded, by a torrent of blood which gushed from his mouth. M. Peyron's sword had in fact pierced his lungs just below the armpit, leaving a slight mark on his back.\n\nMarck recovered from his wounds and directed his martial qualities towards his military career. He bestowed considerable pains on the discipline of his regiment, which became a model for the rest of the service, was appointed inspector-general of infantry, and finally vice-president of the committee for regulating the tactics of the troops of the line, in which latter capacity he acquired considerable reputation.\n\nThese duties were Marck's chief occupation till 1789, apart from them, having married in 1776, Marck led an agreeable life, alternately at Raismes, his country residence near Valenciennes, and at Versailles, where his rank and position gave him the means of observing all that was passing, which he appears to have noted with care and tolerable impartiality. As he had no personal interests to serve, sought no employment, needed no title, had ample wealth, and, the ties of friendship excepted, stood aloof from all who sought the monarch's levée or the minister's ante-chamber.\n\nIn 1789 Marck met with Count de Mirabeau at a dinner given by the Prince de Poix, the Governor of Versailles, to which Mirabeau was taken by M. de Meilhan, a friend of Marck. Though de La Marck and Mirabeau met each other several times after this on terms of growing intimacy, it was not till the convocation of States-General, in 1789, that their friendship became closely cemented.\n\nMarck, who was friend of both the queen and Mirabeau, became a communicator between them. After the march on Versailles Marck consulted Mirabeau as to what measures the king ought to take, and Mirabeau drew up a state paper, which was presented to the king by \"Monsieur\", afterwards Louis XVIII. However as events unfolded these negotiations came to nothing.\n\nDuring this period Marck was first a member of the States-general, and afterwards of the National Assembly. However he was deprived of command of his regiment by the National Assembly and when the royal cause became hopeless he left France, and entered the Austrian army with the rank of major-general. He was employed as a diplomatist on various occasions, but never on any military service. On his brother's establishment at Paris, he was anxious to re-enter the service of France; this however Napoleon would not allow him to do, and he remained at Vienna till 1814, when he came to Brussels, and was made lieutenant-general by the new king of the Netherlands. He left the Dutch army after the revolution of 1830, and died in 1833.\n\n\n"}

She was part of several fact-finding missions to document cases of sexual violence, human rights violations, witch hunting, and conflict situation in the Assam region of India. Acharya has been engaging with UN organisations since 2010 in Geneva, New York and Bangkok. \n\nBondita Acharya was born in Jorhat district of Assam on 12 December 1972. Her father's name was Jogananda Goswami who was a Chemistry Professor at Jagannath Barooah College, Jorhat, Assam. Her mother, Marinalini Goswami, was the Principal of ME Girls School, Jorhat, Assam. Her parents died within the span of two years. She was married to Keyur Achraya, who passed away after six and half years of marriage due to myocardial infarction. She has a son named Palash Acharya.\n\nAcharya did her schooling from Balya Bhavan, Jorhat. She did her 11th & 12th from JB College, where his father was professor. She pursued her Graduation from College of Home Science, Assam Agricultural University and Post Graduation from Department of Extension and Communication, Faculty of Home Science, MS University, Baroda, Gujarat.\n\nAcharya was a Human life defender at Risk under the Protective Fellowship Scheme of the Center for Applied Human Rights (CAHR) in 2015 under York University, UK.\n\nOn April 4, 2017, following a complaint from Bharatiya Janata Party member Mridupawan Bora, three people were arrested in Jorhat, Assam for possessing 500 grams of beef meant for consumption. The consumption of beef is taboo in Hinduism. The law under which the three were arrested, the Assam Cattle Preservation Act, does not criminalize the possession or consumption of beef, but rather sets forth the conditions under which cattle can be slaughtered, causing a question of whether the three could be arrested under the auspices of the act. Acharya condemned the arrests on social media. Bajrang Dal, a Hindu nationalist organization, issued a press statement demanding that Acharya issue a public apology for condemning the arrests.\n\nOn 10 April 2017, Acharya filed a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department in Guwahati, Assam state in Northeast India, after she was the target of violent threats on social media for condemning the arrest of three people for the possession of beef on 4 April 2017. Acharya was threatened with death, rape and acid attacks by members of Bajrang Dal.\n"}

{"id": "46246315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46246315", "title": "Chuck McGill", "text": "Chuck McGill\n\nCharles Lindbergh \"Chuck\" McGill, Jr., is a fictional character who appears in the crime drama television series \"Better Call Saul\", a spin-off prequel of \"Breaking Bad\". He is portrayed by Michael McKean, and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould.\n\nChuck was born in Cicero, Illinois and is the eldest son of Ruth and Charles McGill Sr. He is the older brother of fellow lawyer and titular character Jimmy McGill (\"Saul Goodman\"). Chuck is a successful attorney, who runs his own law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), with partner Howard Hamlin. Chuck has become semi-reclusive and believes that he suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He was amicably divorced from his wife, Rebecca Bois, a few years before the events of \"Better Call Saul\".\n\nAlthough he initially seemed supportive of Jimmy, Chuck harbored resentful feelings toward his brother. His betrayal of and opposition to Jimmy, and his subsequent death, serve as a catalyst for Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman. Chuck's life and death also deeply affect Howard Hamlin and Kim Wexler, Jimmy's law partner and girlfriend.\n\nChuck's character development and McKean's performance throughout the first three seasons received critical acclaim, with many critics claiming that McKean gave the best performance on television in 2017. \n\nChuck was born and raised in Cicero, Illinois. He graduated valedictorian from Francis Xavier High School at the age of 14, making him the youngest graduate in the history of that school. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated \"magna cum laude\" from Georgetown University Law Center. After clerking at both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Chuck joined George Hamlin's solo practice in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Over the next twenty-three years, the two men, along with George's son Howard, built up their law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). Early in his career, Chuck excelled in criminal law, famously arguing and winning the precedent-setting case of \"State v. Gonzalez\".\n\nTen years before the start of the series, when his younger brother Jimmy faced serious charges after defecating through the sunroof of a romantic rival's BMW – unaware the man's children were in the backseat – Chuck bailed him out on the condition that Jimmy abandon his career as a con artist and work a legitimate job in HHM's mailroom. Around the time of his divorce from his wife, Rebecca Bois, Chuck took a leave of absence from HHM after apparently developing electromagnetic hypersensitivity, or a painful allergic sensitivity to electricity. Jimmy, who quit HHM after they refused to hire him after he passed his bar exam, took over Chuck's care and provided his groceries. \n\nIn the pilot episode, Jimmy confronts Howard and demands that HHM cash out Chuck's US$17 million share in the firm. After Jimmy stages a phony rescue of a billboard worker, his actions make the news. Jimmy removes the local paper from Chuck's daily drop-off in order to prevent him from learning about the \"rescue\". Seeing that his neighbors have their papers, Chuck runs outside to steal a neighbor's paper and reads about Jimmy's act. After another neighbor reports him for stealing the paper, he is tasered, arrested and hospitalized. A doctor tries to have Jimmy commit Chuck to a mental institution, but Jimmy convinces her that he is fully capable of looking after Chuck in his own home; the doctor advises Jimmy that Chuck's \"disease\" is entirely psychosomatic.\n\nChuck aids Jimmy in his investigation of the Sandpiper Crossing retirement community, which has been grossly overcharging its elderly residents. At a meeting between the McGill brothers and Sandpiper's attorneys, Chuck demands that they pay $20 million in settlement fees. As they make preparations for a court case, an exhausted Jimmy leaves some paperwork in his car. Preoccupied with his preparation, Chuck casually leaves his house to retrieve the paperwork unprotected from his condition, which stuns both brothers. However, after HHM takes over the Sandpiper case from the McGill brothers, Jimmy realizes that Chuck blocked his advancement at the firm. Upon being confronted by Jimmy, Chuck admits that he doesn't think his brother is a \"real lawyer\", suspecting Jimmy hasn't changed his criminal, short-cutting ways. Jimmy cuts ties with Chuck.\n\nHoward visits Chuck in \"Cobbler\", expressing concern about Jimmy's employment at Davis & Main. Chuck announces his suspicions about the legality of Jimmy's bribery of a Sandpiper bus driver to allow him to solicit a bus full of Sandpiper residents on their way to lunch in \"Amarillo\".\n\nIn a flashback in \"Rebecca\", Jimmy visits Chuck's house shortly after moving to Albuquerque, where he also meets Chuck's wife, Rebecca (Ann Cusack). Jimmy manages to charm Rebecca with his charisma, which makes Chuck uncomfortable. Chuck talks to Kim, and tells her a story about how years ago, Jimmy had secretly embezzled money from their father's business, which led to its eventual collapse. Chuck then promises to try to get Kim reinstated. \n\nAfter Kim leaves HHM in \"Fifi\", Chuck arranges a \"final, tie up loose ends\" meeting with Mesa Verde and masterfully damns Kim with faint praise enough to change the Mesa Verde boss's mind, whereupon he decides to stay with HHM. However, forcing himself to appear normal in the HHM office environment, without \"protection\" from everyday office electromagnetic radiation leads to Chuck's collapse.\n\nin \"Nailed\", at what should have been a routine meeting between the New Mexico Banking Board, Mesa Verde Bank and Chuck and Howard, it is revealed that the addresses in the documents Chuck submitted (based on those Jimmy falsified) do not match those initially filed, creating a six-week delay in Mesa Verde's plans to open their newest branch. A humiliated Chuck immediately suspects that Jimmy is responsible for the sabotage. Dissatisfied with this turn of events and HHM's performance, Mesa Verde decides to leave HHM and sign with Kim.\n\nIn a flashback in \"Klick\", Chuck and Jimmy are beside their comatose mother's hospital bed. Jimmy leaves to buy sandwiches for himself and for Chuck, who has not eaten for days. While Chuck is alone with his mother she wakes and calls Jimmy's name twice before dying. Jimmy returns to find his mother's room empty, and asks Chuck if their mother awakened or had any last words. Chuck says she did not. Returning to 2002, Jimmy rushes into the copy store and orders the clerk to call an ambulance. In the hospital, Chuck, now stable, wonders how it was possible for Jimmy to come to his aid in the copy store when Chuck had only been unconscious for less than a minute, correctly deducing that Jimmy had bribed the clerk and then stayed to watch. However, Ernesto covers for Jimmy, lying to Chuck that he called Jimmy before going to the copy store. Howard calls Jimmy to advise that Chuck has quit HHM. Jimmy rushes to Chuck's house, where he finds his brother covering the walls, floor and ceiling of his living room with foil sheets. Chuck explains that the walls of his home were doing nothing to deflect electromagnetic rays, and this has led to the deterioration of his mind over time, hence his inexcusable mistake with the Mesa Verde documents. Feeling guilty about his deception and Chuck's unnecessary decision to abandon his beloved law profession, Jimmy confesses to tampering with the documents and bribing the copy store clerk, assuring Chuck that his mind is not deteriorating. After Jimmy leaves, Chuck unveils a tape recorder he had hidden and activated prior to Jimmy's arrival.\n\nJimmy helps Chuck remove the foil from his wall and reminisces over a book they read together during their youth; Chuck is quick to sever the nostalgia and remind him that his actions won't be forgotten or forgiven. Chuck plays Jimmy's confession to Hamlin, who warns him that the tape has no legal or public value. Chuck assures him that it has a use. Chuck later arranges for a key part of the tape to be played by Ernesto in a way that appears to Ernesto to be accidental. Chuck quickly turns the player off and makes Ernesto promise not to repeat anything that he heard to anyone on the premise of confidentiality. However, it's part of Chuck's plan to get Jimmy disbarred.\n\nAs part of Chuck's plan, Ernesto approaches Wexler-McGill but decides against entering and speaks to Kim in the parking lot about the tape. Kim relays this to Jimmy and the former takes the latter on as her legal client, advising him that the tape is no legal threat to him. Jimmy suppresses his feelings of anger and betrayal in front of Kim, but later drives to Chuck's house, breaks in, berates him and destroys the tape. However, this more or less all happens according to Chuck's plan, as he only used the tape as bait and Hamlin and the private investigator are present to witness Jimmy's break-in.\n\nJimmy is arrested, following a few harsh but hesitant words with Chuck and chooses to represent himself (against Kim's wishes), pleads not guilty and posts bail. Jimmy later explains what happened during his break-in and tells Kim to work on Mesa Verde while he works his own legal battle, to which she flatly agrees. The prosecutor in Jimmy's case, Hay, meets with Chuck and tells him that she doesn't plan to let Jimmy off easy. Chuck wishes to seek a \"better solution for everyone\": Jimmy can avoid jail time, but will have to confess to his felony break-in and submit his confession to the New Mexico Bar Association, which will likely result in disbarment. Kim convinces Jimmy to let her help him fight Chuck's plot.\n\nJimmy, Kim, Hamlin, Chuck and ADA Hay meet in order to finalize Jimmy's confession, with Jimmy agreeing to have his confession reviewed by the New Mexico Bar Association. After the meeting, Kim confronts Chuck, telling him that she suspects he has a copy of the tape. Chuck confirms her suspicions and states that he plans to submit the tape as evidence in Jimmy's disciplinary hearing. Kim then relays the information to Jimmy, revealing that having Chuck admit the existence of the second tape was all according to their plan.\n\nIn a flashback in \"Chicanery\", Chuck invites Rebecca over for dinner and comes up with an elaborate lie about the power to his house being cut so he doesn't have to reveal his EHS to her. However, Rebecca answers her cell phone, causing Chuck to knock it out of her hands in a panic. He refuses to explain his actions to her and forbids Jimmy from revealing the truth. In the present, both sides gear up for Jimmy’s hearing in front of the New Mexico Bar Association after Jimmy meets with Caldera to acquire the services of \"someone with a light touch.\" At the hearing, things do not seem to go well for Jimmy as the tape is played before the committee. Rebecca enters the courtroom, much to Chuck’s surprise, though he believes it's some ploy by Jimmy to throw him off balance. Indeed, it is, as earlier, Jimmy and Kim had hired Mike Ehrmantraut to enter Chuck's house posing as a repairman hired to fix Chuck's front door, and take pictures of Chuck's living conditions to show to Rebecca. Later, Jimmy cross-examines Chuck about the circumstances of the recording, Rebecca’s presence and his illness. Though Chuck remains calm throughout most of it, Jimmy reveals that Chuck has been carrying a fully charged cell phone battery planted by Huell for the entire hearing, contradicting the EHS symptoms Chuck claimed to have and suggesting he has a mental illness. This triggers a sudden and acidic tirade from Chuck as he vents all of his frustrations about Jimmy and how he never should have tried to help him. Chuck realizes, too late, that his outburst has shocked the entire courtroom, including the committee.\n\nJimmy is given only a year's suspension in the aftermath of his legal battle with Chuck. While he and Kim celebrate, Rebecca asks Jimmy to help with Chuck, who has shuttered himself in his home, but Jimmy refuses, no longer calling Chuck his brother. Chuck later admits Howard into his home. Howard suggests to Chuck that he forget about Jimmy and look to the future, which Chuck appears to agree to. However, Chuck is later seen walking through the streets of Albuquerque, dialing Dr. Cruz, the doctor who diagnosed his condition, over a payphone. He admits that the events of the disciplinary hearing demonstrated that his EHS may not be real. Dr. Cruz agrees to help Chuck, and he is able to walk to a store to buy groceries on his own.\n\nKim feels some regret for destroying Chuck's reputation in the disciplinary hearing. While having dinner with Jimmy, she wonders whether they did the right thing and Jimmy replies what happened to Chuck was his own fault and that she should forget about him. Desperate for funds to keep up his end of office expenses, Jimmy meets with an insurance agent to try and get a refund on his malpractice insurance policy. However, the agent is unable to grant the refund and mentions that due to his suspension, Jimmy's premium will rise by 150%. Jimmy is visibly shaken by this news and starts to cry. When the agent reacts sympathetically to his emotional breakdown, Jimmy seizes the opportunity to \"accidentally\" mention Chuck's mental illness before leaving, knowing that the insurance company will be forced to act on the information.\n\nThe insurance company's representatives meet with Howard and Chuck and give them an ultimatum: either they can have HHM's malpractice insurance premiums raised, or have Chuck supervised at all times. Chuck refuses to negotiate and instead decides to fight the insurance company in court. This proves to be the last straw for Howard, who informs Chuck that he will be forced to retire since his judgment can no longer be trusted. Chuck responds by suing HHM for $8 million, the value of his share of the practice. Howard, who cares deeply about his employees, calls Chuck's bluff by paying off Chuck's $9 million share out of his own pocket. \n\nJimmy tries to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck coldly cuts ties with Jimmy. After forcing Jimmy away, Chuck's EHS symptoms begin to re-emerge, and he becomes obsessed with disabling all electronic devices in his home to the point of tearing walls open to remove the wiring. He eventually reaches a breaking point and knocks the gas lantern over, setting fire to his house, while he is still inside. \n\nAfter this scene there was much speculation as to what happened to Chuck after the fire started. Creator Peter Gould said, \"I dont want to define anything more than what's on screen.\" Michael McKean told \"Vulture\" that he learned Chuck's fate while driving: \"I got a call on my cell from Peter [and] Vince [Gilligan]. I said, 'If this is the death call, I'm going to pull over.' And that's what I did. I pulled into the parking lot of the bookstore and I called them back and they told me what they had planned. They told me they had laughed about what I had said, but they had to deliver it.\" When he was asked by \"The New York Times\" whether Chuck is dead, McKean said: \"I am. I know they want to bring me in for some flashbacks this coming season, but that's kind of beside the point.\" Following the announcement of the premiere date of the fourth season, Chuck's death was confirmed.\n\nUpon hearing the news of Chuck's death, Jimmy and Kim race over, just as the coroner's van is leaving with Chuck's corpse. Jimmy knows that Chuck seemed well five days prior, showing no signs of his electromagnetic hypersensitivity, but since then, all of his electronics had been thrown out, meaning he must have relapse. Jimmy falls into a deep depression.\n\nHoward helps to arrange for Chuck's funeral, which many of Chuck's former legal associates attend. After the funeral, Howard approaches Jimmy and Kim and takes the blame for Chuck's death, having forced Chuck out of HHM due to the insurance rate hike. Upon hearing Howard's admission, Jimmy immediately regains his happy-go-lucky composure. Chuck, despite his lucrative law firm, and high net worth, leaves his house to his ex-wife over Jimmy, and leaves him $5,000 only so that Jimmy cannot legally contest the will in court for a higher amount. He also leaves an encouraging letter he wrote to Jimmy when the two were on far better terms that Jimmy eventually reads.\n\nChuck also appears in a flashback sequence, having a conversation with Kim Wexler and his brother Jimmy, in a scene set 10 years before the show's events and his problems with EHS.\n\nWhen Jimmy eventually goes to take his $5,000, needing the money for his burner phone business, he discovers that HHM is falling apart and has experienced massive layoffs. Howard admits that they are having trouble paying out to Chuck's estate. As well, Chuck's actions over the previous seasons, particularly his breakdown at the bar hearing have damaged HHM's reputation, possibly beyond repair, apparently causing HHM to have trouble attracting and keeping clients. Due to his guilt over his perceived role in Chuck's death, Howard is far more subdued and seems uninterested in doing anything to fix the damage.\n\nMichael McKean's portrayal of Chuck McGill was critically acclaimed. \n\nThe first season episode \"Pimento\" received critical acclaim, with many critics praising the performances from Bob Odenkirk and Michael McKean. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a 9.0 rating, concluding, \"Better Call Saul revealed the betrayal that may very well be at the heart of what turns Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman, as this stunningly crafted story continues to unfold.\" \n\nThe third season episode \"Chicanery\", received universal acclaim from critics, with some considering it to be a series-best. Terri Schwartz of IGN awarded the episode 10 out of 10, describing it as \"the best episode of Better Call Saul to date\". It currently holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes with an average of 9.5/10 based on 12 reviews. The site consensus reads: \"The war between Jimmy and Chuck comes to an unprecedented climax in the heartbreaking, sober, and defining 'Chicanery', an episode that clearly cements \"Better Call Saul\" as essential television.\" \n\nTVLine named Michael McKean the \"Performer of the Week\" for his performance in this episode, writing it was the \"finest showcase yet for his fascinatingly layered performance as Jimmy's brother Chuck McGill.\" Donna Bowman of \"The A.V. Club\", who gave the episode an \"A\" rating, praised the courtroom scene, saying \"it isn’t just to give us the satisfaction of a courtroom drama, the neat ending where the truth comes out. The brilliance of this structure is to give us a slow-motion view of the heavens falling, an outcome methodically pursued by Kim and Jimmy, which nevertheless seems to give them no satisfaction.\" \n\nMany critics were disappointed when McKean, who was said to have given \"one of the best performances by anyone in TV all year\", failed to secure an Emmy nomination while his co-star Jonathan Banks did.\n\nFor his performances as Chuck McGill, Michael McKean won a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2018 at the 22nd Satellite Awards.\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz of \"Vulture\" considers him to be the \"Better Call Saul\" version of \"Breaking Bad\" character Skyler White.\n\n\n \n"}

He qualified aged 21 as a member of the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers, which merged with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 2000.\n\nBarby started working for a local firm in Rugby, before leaving to work in London in 1974. He was head hunted by Royal Leamington Spa-based auction house Locke and England, and he joined them in 1978 as a manager and valuer. He later became a partner, retiring from the business in 2003. Barby was an expert on Victorian porcelain to antique pedestal desks.\n\nBarby started his own independent valuation business, Hillmorton-based David J. Barby and Associates, in the 1990s, where he still worked at the time of his death. As an auctioneer, his affable manner made him very popular and particularly with those bidding. His great success in October 2000 was the sale of a £1 million collection.\n\nThe Royal Leamington Society marked its Jubilee Year in 2006 with an \"Evening with David Barby on Images of the 50s\", at the Town Hall in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. Similar evenings with David Barby were held at Snitterfield Village Hall, Stratford-upon-Avon and other locations.\n\nBarby was well known for the charity work that he carried out, as a fundraiser for the Royal Leamington Spa Rehabilitation Hospital and Leamington Art Gallery. He was also president of the Friends of Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum.\n\nBarby gave series of lectures on antiques and were reported as a riot of laughter and few knew how very enjoyable and funny the antiques business could be. He gave lectures to groups such as NADFAS, Women's Institutes, and historical and arts societies, as well as on cruise ships.\n\nBarby was the subject of the July 2007 newsletter article, \"My Life in Antiques\", based on a speech he gave to the UK Belleek Collectors' Group Spring Meeting in 2007.\n\nAnybody could speak to him as he gave much time in sharing stories, memories, nostalgia, and passion for old things with members of the public. Charles Hanson, a friend of Barby said, \"more important he is a man of the people\".\n\nBarby appeared in the first episode of \"Flog It!\" in 2002 as the auctioneer, but was soon also employed as an expert. He was already becoming well known in a similar role on \"Bargain Hunt\", and later appeared on \"Antiques Road Trip\", where he became known by the nickname \"The Master\". David Barby featured in the 500th show of the popular BBC programme \"Bargain Hunt\" on the red team alongside Philip Serrell.\n\nBarby also appeared in episode 1 of the TV Series \"Housecall\" on 4 February 2002.\n\nHe appeared to fall in Widemarsh Street, Hereford in 2012 while filming an episode of the \"Antiques Road Trip\". In 2011 and 2012, there were other reports of him having minor facial injuries, viewed on television. It should be noted that many people fell in Widemarsh Street that became quite notorious for falls.\n\nBarby was an ambassador of antiques on television.\n\nFollowing his death, \"Bargain Hunt\" paid tribute to Barby in an episode broadcast on 1 October 2012, with a montage of his appearances shown at the end of the programme. A similar montage by \"Antiques Road Trip\" was shown on 5 October 2012.\n\nBarby stood in the Caldecott district of Rugby in 2002 as a prospective Conservative councillor, but came fourth in a ward which elected only three councillors. He took part in fundraising events such as 'Antiques Evening with David Barby' for the Solihull Conservative Association. As in 2011 these events were sold out.\n\nBarby suffered a brain haemorrhage at his Rugby home on 12 July 2012, dying two weeks later on 25 July 2012 in a hospital in Coventry, aged 69. Over 500 people attended a memorial service at St Andrew's Church, Rugby on 2 September 2012. A tribute was given by Philip Serrell. Tributes were also made by the BBC, TV programme \"Flog It\", and Presenter Tim Wonnacott. Wonnacott expressed his shock on behalf of the team at \"Bargain Hunt\" and spoke of his high standards and professionalism as an expert, and also his wicked sense of humour and sense of fun. David Barby was buried at Watts Lane Cemetery, Hillmorton, in Rugby, Warwickshire.\n\n"}

Helfgott's life inspired the Academy Award-winning film \"Shine\", in which he was portrayed by actors Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor.\n\nHelfgott was born in Melbourne to Polish Jewish parents Rachel (née Granek) and Elias Peter Helfgott. He won the state final of the ABC Instrumental and Vocal Competition six times.\n\nThe awards he won at the Royal College of Music included the Dannreuther Prize for Best Concerto Performance, for his performance of Rachmaninoff's \"Piano Concerto No. 3\", and the Marmaduke Barton Prize.\n\nDuring his time in London, he began showing more definite manifestations of schizoaffective disorder. He returned to Perth in 1970. The following year he married Clare Papp, who had four children. He worked as a rehearsal pianist for the Western Australian Opera Company.\n\nIn 1983, his brother Les Helfgott found him working at a Perth wine bar called Riccardo's.\n\nHelfgott was the subject of the 1996 film \"Shine\", which dealt with the pianist's formative years and struggle with mental illness. Helfgott was portrayed by actors Geoffrey Rush (adult), Noah Taylor (teenager) and Alex Rafalowicz (child). His brother Les has described the portrayal of their father in both \"Shine\" and in Gillian Helfgott's biography as \"all outright lies\". David Helfgott's first wife Clare Papp has also said that Peter Helfgott was \"quite badly maligned\" in the film.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of \"Limelight\" magazine, published in the September 2013 edition, Margaret and Les Helfgott refer to certain claims made in an article in the August 2013 edition and state that \"there was no estrangement from members of David's family following his return to Australia. On the contrary, he moved straight back into the family home, and was cared for by our family. Dad was not 'overbearing', and his main objection to David's going abroad was his concern for his son's welfare.\"\n\nHelfgott generally prefers to perform Romantic music, mostly Mussorgsky, Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Liszt, Schumann and Rimsky-Korsakov. However, his recordings and performances, especially that of Rachmaninoff's \"Piano Concerto No. 3\", have been criticized as \"pallid, erratic and incoherent.\" Of the two commercial recordings released by RCA, the American journal \"Fanfare Magazine\" was critical not only of Helfgott himself, but also of his producers, who were \"marketing Helfgott's pain.\" The British magazine \"Gramophone\" was similarly scathing about the exploitative nature of their issue, which, the magazine said, falsely marketed Helfgott as an \"unsung genius\".\n\nOn stage, Helfgott is known for his unusual platform manner. In 1997, critic Anthony Tommasini noted that Helfgott \"stares into the hall and renders a nonstop commentary of grunts, groans and mutterings\". Of a 1997 Helfgott recital in New Zealand, critic Denis Dutton wrote, \"If, as Goethe claimed, architecture is frozen music, David Helfgott is the musician who finally proves the converse: that music can also be melted architecture — a structureless rubble of notes.\"\n\nHelfgott tours Australia annually and plays a small number of recitals in other countries.\n\nHelfgott's 2015 European tour was the subject of a documentary, \"Hello, I Am David!\"\n\nHelfgott and his second wife, Gillian, live in The Promised Land, a valley near Bellingen in New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He has won three Grammy Awards, ten Stellar Awards, two BET Awards, two Soul Train Awards, one Dove Award and one NAACP Image Awards. He is one of the top selling Gospel music artists, selling over 10 million albums worldwide. \"Variety\" dubbed McClurkin as a “Reigning King of Urban Gospel”.\n\nMcClurkin was born in Chester, South Carolina. When he was eight years old, his two-year-old brother was hit and killed by a speeding driver. Soon after the loss, McClurkin experienced family turmoil due to the loss of his brother and shortly thereafter he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of his great uncle, and years after that by his great uncle's son. Two of his sisters dealt with substance abuse problems, and that's when the young McClurkin found solace in his going to a church; and, also through an aunt of his who sang background vocals with gospel music musician, Andraé Crouch. By the time that he was a teenager, he had formed the McClurkin Singers, and later he formed another group, the New York Restoration Choir, with recordings from as early as 1975.\n\nHe was hired, as an associate minister, at Marvin Winans' Perfecting Church in Detroit, Michigan, in 1989. McClurkin served as an assistant to Winans for over a decade.\n\nIn 1991, a sharp pain and swelling, followed by internal bleeding led, he says, to his being diagnosed as having leukemia. The doctor suggested immediate treatment, but McClurkin, who was then 31, decided to take his own advice. \"I tell people to believe that God will save you,\" he says, \"[and] I had to turn around and practice the very thing that I preached.\"\n\nHe was ordained and sent out by the Winans in 2001 to establish Perfecting Faith Church in Freeport, New York, where there is no First Lady, but he is now Senior Pastor.\n\nA friendship with a Warner Alliance executive resulted in his signing to the label for his 1996 self-titled LP, with producers Bill Maxwell, Mark Kibble of Take 6, Cedric and Victor Caldwell plus Andraé Crouch. The disc, which featured the perennially popular \"Stand,\" went gold shortly after being publicly lauded by Oprah Winfrey. At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, he won in the category Traditional Soul Gospel Album, for \"Psalms, Hymns & Spiritual Songs\". McClurkin is best known for his hit songs \"Stand\" and \"We Fall Down\" which were played in heavy rotation on both Gospel and Urban radio. His three solo albums have topped the Billboard charts.\n\nDovetailing off the success of his near double-platinum selling album,\"Live in London and More\" McClurkin released \"Psalms,Hymns and Spiritual Songs\" in 2005 and \"We All Are One: Live In Detroit\" in 2009 which also topped Billboard charts across various musical genres. McClurkin's love for people and desire to share gospel music, globally, is the reason he includes a language medley: Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Dutch in most live performances.\n\nTom Versen and Tony Sisti of T&T Creative signed McClurkin to a radio syndication deal with advertising giant Dial-Global and syndicator Gary Bernstein. T&T Creative provided a mobile recording studio in Pastor Donnie's church that he can also take on the road. He is quoted as saying, \"As much as I love music and singing, I really love doing radio and the direct feedback I get from my listeners all over the country. I never thought I would be having this much fun doing radio and I could touch and impact so many beautiful people.\"[19]\n\nIn 2009, he also broadcast his own television series, \"Perfecting Your Faith\", on cable television. His television appearances include \"Good Morning America\", CBS’s \"The Early Show\", \"The View\", \"Girlfriends\" and \"The Parkers\". He has also been featured in such films as \"The Gospel\" and \"The Fighting Temptations\". He played a Single Man or a Church Pastor.\n\nMcClurkin, in 2002, told a Christian website that, due to the sexual abuse, he had struggled with homosexuality. He also said that he had rejected that \"lifestyle\": \"I’ve been through this and have experienced God’s power to change my lifestyle. I am delivered and I know God can deliver others, too.\"\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that McClurkin had entered a relationship with CCM singer-songwriter Nicole C.

According to Gregorovius, he was a \"maverick\" in the great Pierleoni family, for he continued to oppose the papacy after Anacletus' death, when the rest of his clan had returned to support of Rome.\n\nIn late autumn 1143, the democratic element in Rome set up a Senate in opposition to the higher nobility and the papacy. Drawing on the glorious ancient Roman Republic, the citizens declared a senate, based on four elected representatives from each of the newly created fourteen districts of medieval Rome, the first real senators since the seventh century. The fifty six senators then elected as patrician Pierleoni, because the title of consul had taken on noble connotations. Pierleoni led the defence of the city against Pope Lucius II's assault in 1145, where Lucius himself was killed. However, Pierleoni could not maintain order in the city and, despite his overtures of negotiations with Lucius—demanding the pope renounce secular authority and live as a common priest before being allowed reentry into the city, —he was deposed by the people, who invited Pope Eugene III, Lucius' successor, back. The power vacuum left by Pierleoni's deposition caused even more anarchy and eventually the pope left and a less illustrious man than Giordano, Giacomo da Vico, was elected patrician—though a man his equal, Arnold of Brescia, had arrived in the commune in 1145. Arnold would renew the commune, giving it the intellectual leadership it lacked after Pierleoni's downfall.\n\n"}

He received training in Erivan and Tiflis in electrical engineering, before he was invited to Iran in 1901 to set up an electrical plant for Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad. His father was Ali-Akbar Afshar (a physician) and his mother was Zahra. Because local people tend to call his father \"Amo\" (\"Uncle\" in Persian and Azeri language), they also called him \"Amo-oghli\" (\"Cousin\" in Azeri language). He immigrated to Alexandropol in 1886. As a student of Tbilisi Polytechnic University, he became acquainted with the ideas of socialism closer and in 1898 joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.\n\nHaydar Khan arrived in Iran as an inexperienced young man who knew no Persian and was unfamiliar with Iranian society and culture, but was driven to action by his restlessness, his sense of mission, and a belief in his exceptional love for Iran and the Iranians. Upon humiliating an official (Saham ol mulk Motavalibashi) in Khorasan, he comments in his memoirs, \"I had only one purpose in mind, which was to show the people of Khorasan (Iran) who had little or no education and understanding that <nowiki>[the official]</nowiki> was also an ordinary human being\". He remained 15 months in Mashhad and after that he went to Tehran as the engineer of Haj Amin Al-zarb electrical plant.\n\nHe arrived Tehran in 1903, where the Constitutional Revolution was about to unfold. He may have exaggerated his role in the Constitutional Revolution when he claimed that he was the one who sent the first group of people to take refuge on the grounds of the British Embassy. However, upon the death of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah and the accession of Mohammad Ali Shah, Haydar Khan, now more experienced and knowledgeable, played a significant role in radicalizing the course of Iranian politics.\n\nOn the very day that the Anglo-Russian Agreement was signed in St. Petersburg in 1907, dividing Iran into two spheres of influence, Ali Asghar Khan, the powerful Persian premier, was shot in front of the Majles. Haydar Khan admitted that he had masterminded the assassination, and this was confirmed by Hassan Taqizadeh, who, however, denies that there existed a \"Terror Committee\" on whose orders Haydar Khan carried out this act. Ali Asghar Khan had just persuaded the Shah to work with Parliament, where he had a strong enough base to guarantee its cooperation. As a result of his death, the parliamentary coalition he had built soon evaporated. Moreover, the Shah became more suspicious of Parliament, and, as the politicized crowd saw the revolutionary potential of prime minister's removal, Parliament became less willing to accommodate the Shah. The lines became sharply drawn, increasing the likelihood of violent conflict.\n\nOther members of the political elite who attempted to bridge the gap between the Shah and the Constitutionalists were also the targets of Haydar Khan's political terrorism. These included Mirza Ahmad Khan Ala-al-Dawla and the Khedmat Society, which included members of the old regime who professed Constitutionalist sympathies. However, the most radical attack by Haydar Khan took place on 28 February 1908, when a bomb was thrown at the Shah's motorcade. Haydar Khan was found responsible for the plot and was arrested, but he was soon released at the insistence of his parliamentary Social Democrat friends. This single act of violence was followed by the Shah's closing of Parliament. The Shah and the Constitutionalists now stood against each other, and both sides were armed. Consequently, in 1909, for the first time in the Middle East, a monarch was dethroned in the name of the people.\n\nDuring this conflict, Haydar Khan first escaped to Caucasia, where he helped in the provision of men and material for the revolutionaries, before returning to fight alongside them - providing the basis for the character of Johnny English, as portrayed by Rowan Atkinson in the 2003 film of the same name. Once the Shah had been dethroned, he joined the radical Democratic Party and organized the assassination in January 1910 of Ayatollah Mirza Sayyed Abdullah Behbahani, who led the conservative wing of the Constitutionalists.\n\nLater, Haydar Khan, in support of the Democrats and the governmental forces during the government of the popular Mirza Hasan Khan Mostawfi-al-Mamalek, participated in attacks against the Sattar Khan and Baqer Khan and Mojahed groups, veterans of the armed struggle during the Constitutional revolution who were now providing military support for the Conservatives. Haydar Khan and the Democrats supported Yeprem Khan, the Armenian head of the police force, and succeeded in disarming them. Sattar Khan died soon afterwards as a consequence of an injury he sustained in action.\n\nIn March 1911 Haydar Khan was forced to leave Iran. The Conservatives had regrouped, and the Russians, who invaded Iran and occupied Azerbaijan, did not want a revolutionary neighbor on their border. After obtaining money from the deposed Shah in Russia, by pretending that he would help him regain his throne, Haydar Khan left for Europe.\n\nThe 1917 Russian Revolution provided an opportunity for Haydar Khan to go back to the Caucasus and participate in the Baku Congress in 1921, as one of the leaders of the Iranian delegation. Haydar Khan was sent back to Iran by the Bolsheviks to settle the conflict which raged between the Jangalis and the Communist Party of Persia in Gilan. Although accounts of this episode vary in their details, it is almost certain that he was killed by a group of Jangalis soon afterwards, with or without Mirza Kuchek's knowledge. Following this his body was extensively embalmed and smuggled out of the country to France. His remains are now preserved by former Iranian crown prince Patrick Ali Pahlavi, who runs a mowing business.\n"}

Born without the lower half of his torso, Eck is best known today for his role in Tod Browning's 1932 cult classic film \"Freaks\" and his appearances as a bird creature in several Tarzan films. He was often billed as \"The Amazing Half-Boy\", \"King of the Freaks\" and \"The Most Remarkable Man Alive\".\n\nBesides being a sideshow performer and actor, the multi-talented Eck was also an artist, musician, photographer, illusionist, penny arcade owner, Punch and Judy operator, and expert model-maker.\n\nJohn Eckhardt, Jr. was born on August 27, 1911 to Emilia (b. circa 1876) and John Eckhardt, Sr. (b. 1874) in Baltimore, Maryland, as a fraternal twin. His brother Robert Eckhardt was also a performer and he had an older sister named Caroline Laura Echhardt. Eck was born with a truncated torso due to sacral agenesis. Though Eck would sometimes describe himself as \"snapped off at the waist\", he had unusable, underdeveloped legs and feet that he would hide under custom-made clothing. At birth, Eck weighed two pounds (0.9 kg) and was less than eight inches (20 cm) in length. He would eventually reach a height of eighteen inches (45 cm). Though Eck capitalized on the resemblance between himself and Robert, the twins were fraternal. Aside from the sacral agenesis, Eck was healthy.\n\nEck was walking on his hands before his brother was standing when he was a year old. Both of the Eckhardt twins could read by the age of four. The twins had an older sister named Caroline who educated Eck at home until he and his brother enrolled in public school at age seven. He recalled that larger students would \"fight each other for the 'honor' or 'privilege' of lifting [him] up the stone steps\" to school, and that school windows were blacked out to discourage throngs of curious onlookers from peering in at Eck during his studies. In spite of the scrutiny, Eck remained consistently upbeat about his birth defect. When asked if he wished he had legs, he quipped, \"Why would I want those? Then I'd have pants to press.\" He challenged those who did have legs by asking, \"What can you do that I can't do, except tread water?\"\n\nEmilia Eckhardt intended that Eck go into the ministry, and the young Eck was often called upon to perform impromptu sermons for guests. \"I would climb atop of a small box and preach against drinking beer and damning sin and the devil,\" Eck recalled in an autobiographical fragment. These sermons quickly came to an end when Eck began passing around a saucer for donations.\n\nAt an early age, Eck developed an interest in painting and woodworking, and would spend hours with his brother carving and painting elaborate, fully articulated circuses.\n\nIn late 1923, Eck and his brother attended a performance of stage magic at a local church by John McAslan. When McAslan asked for volunteers for his act, 12-year-old Eck bounded onto the stage on his hands to the surprise of the magician. McAslan convinced Eck to join the sideshow with him as manager; Eck agreed, but only if his brother was also employed. Robert was charged with looking after his brother by their mother. His parents signed a one-year contract, which Eck claimed the magician later changed to a ten-year contract by adding a zero. In 1924, Eck left McAslan and signed on with a carny named Captain John Sheesley.\n\nEck was billed as a single-o (solo sideshow act), though he traveled with Robert and used Robert's normality to emphasize his own abnormal physique. His performance included sleight-of-hand and acrobatic feats including his famous one-armed handstand. Eck often performed in a tuxedo jacket while perched upon a tasseled stool. Eck performed for Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey and others.\n\nEck went to the Canadian Exposition in the summer of 1931. Eck was performing in Montreal when he was approached by a MGM Studios talent scout to be cast for his first feature film as the \"Half-Boy\" in Tod Browning's 1932 film \"Freaks\".\n\nEck got along quite well with Tod Browning and was often at his side while on set. Eck would later say that \"Browning wanted me to stay as close to him as possible. He told me whenever I have an empty seat or chair, you are to sit alongside me while we shoot.\" Although he sometimes tried to socialize, he didn't feel comfortable mingling with his castmates, whom he described as a \"happy, noisy crowd\" and \"childish, silly and in a world all their own.\" At one point he complained that they had gone \"Hollywood\" because of the film, \"wear[ing] sunglasses and acting funny.\" When Pete Robinson had difficulty lying on a blanket in one scene, Eck made the comment that if he had legs, he would have lain on a fakir's bed of nails. Olga Baclanova would reminisce fondly of her costar (whom she described as \"handsome\"), \"When we finished the picture, he came and gave me a present. He had made a circus ring made from matches. He said he had made it in my honor.\"\n\nEck claimed that Browning wished to do a follow-up picture with him and Robert where he would play a mad scientist's creation. However, Browning's career was irretrievably hurt by \"Freaks\", and he no longer had the clout with studios to do many of the projects he wished to do. Eck was also disappointed by how much of his part had been trimmed from the film in the nearly thirty minutes that were cut by censors.\n\nAfter \"Freaks\", Eck was featured as a bird creature or \"Gooney Bird\" in three Tarzan movies: \"Tarzan the Ape Man\" (1932), \"Tarzan Escapes\" (1936) and \"Tarzan's Secret Treasure\" (1941). In order to create the bird costume used by Eck for the Tarzan films, footage which was filmed during the production of \"Freaks\" in 1931, a full body cast was taken of him.\n\nWhen the Eckhardt home was facing foreclosure due to the oncoming Great Depression, Eck performed for the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Odditorium at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. It was there that Eck was billed as \"the Most Remarkable Man Alive\".\n\nIn 1937, Eck and Robert were recruited by the illusionist and hypnotist Rajah Raboid, for his \"Miracles of 1937\" show. In it they performed a magic feat that amazed audiences. Raboid performed the traditional sawing-a-man-in-half illusion, except with an unexpected twist. At first Robert would pretend to be a member of the audience and heckle the illusionist during his routine, resulting in Robert being called on stage to be sawed in half himself. During the illusion, Robert would then be switched with his twin brother Eck, who played the top half of his body, and a dwarf, who played the bottom half, concealed in specially-built pant legs. After being sawed in half, the legs would suddenly get up and start running away, prompting Eck to jump off the table and start chasing his legs around the stage, screaming, \"Come back!\" \"I want my legs back!\" Sometimes he even chased the legs into the audience. The subsequent reaction was amazing - people would scream and sometimes even flee the theater in terror. As Eck described it, \"The men were more frightened than the women - the women couldn't move because the men were walking across their laps, headed for the exit.\" The act provided the perfect jolt by frightening people at first but then caused just as much laughter and applause. The illusion would end with stage hands plucking up Eck and setting him atop his legs and then twirling him off-stage to be replaced by his twin Robert, who would then loudly threaten to sue Raboid and storm out of the theater. Their act was so popular that they played to packed audiences up and down the East coast.\n\nIn addition to film, sideshow and stage, Eck was also pursuing other interests in this period. He and his brother were musicians, having their own twelve-piece orchestra in Baltimore. Eck conducted while Robert played the piano. Eck continued his love of drawing and painting, early on choosing such subjects as pretty girls, ships and himself. He was also a race car enthusiast and the driver of his own custom-built race car that was street-legal in Baltimore, the \"Johnny Eck Special\". In 1938, Eck climbed the Washington Monument on his hands.\n\nWhen sideshows lost popular appeal, the Eckhardt brothers returned to their red brick rowhouse at 622 North Milton Avenue, in the East-side, working-class section of Baltimore. This was the same house that the family had lived in since 1906, and is where the Eckhardt brothers resided for the rest of their lives. In Baltimore they bought and ran a penny arcade until a business tax forced them out of business. In the 1950s, the brothers bought and ran a used children's train ride in a local park; Eck acting as conductor. Eck also became a screen painter, having learned the craft from William Oktavec, a grocer and local folk artist who invented the art form in 1913. Eck is interviewed about the craft in the 1989 documentary film \"The Screen Painters\".\n\nEck would sit on the steps of his porch with his Chihuahua, Major, telling stories about his life. He and his brother often performed Punch and Judy shows for the children who would come to visit. However, the Eckhardts' neighborhood was increasingly becoming less safe with drugs and crime.\n\nThe 1980s brought more visitors as the video release of \"Freaks\" attracted a new generation of fans, some of whom Eck wasn't entirely comfortable with, telling a friend, \"You'd be surprised to see these 'avid' fans. I say they are crazy.\" But he also expressed dismay at his own circumstances. Despite having a notable career that had spanned back to the 1920s, Eck had very little material-wise to show for his successes - what he attributed to being taken advantage of over the years by unscrupulous managers, \"sharp crooks,\" and even \"best friends.\" Describing the situation of fans dropping by his rowhouse on Milton, Eck wrote to a close friend in 1985, \"I am so embarrassed - I would love to be financially able to entertain these wonderful people in a refined way - a tiny sandwich, cold Cola or something...\"\n\nIn January 1987, the then 76-year-old Eckhardt brothers were robbed in an ordeal that lasted several hours. One of the two thieves mocked and sat on Eck while the other took his belongings. Thereafter, Eck went into seclusion and the brothers no longer invited visitors into their home. Eck would go on to say, \"If I want to see freaks, all I have to do is look out the window.\"\n\nOn January 5, 1991, Eck suffered a heart attack in his sleep, dying at the age of 79 at the home where he was born. Robert followed him on February 25, 1995, aged 83. They are buried under one headstone in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore.\n\nA Hollywood feature film on the life of Johnny Eck has been pursued since the 1990s by Leonardo DiCaprio. A screenplay has been written by Caroline Thompson, the acclaimed scriptwriter of \"Edward Scissorhands\". Production will be by Pelagius Films and Joseph Fries will produce while Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Rappa executive produce the film. Production notes include James Franco as a possible replacement to play the Eckhardt twins.\n\nThe screenplay has been described as \"amazing\" and includes a scene where Eck swims against Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller.\n\nThe song \"Table Top Joe\", which describes a man without a lower body who becomes a famous entertainer, by Tom Waits is based loosely on the life of Johnny Eck. He is also mentioned in the piece \"Lucky Day (Overture)\" on Waits' album \"The Black Rider\".\nA character inspired by Eck makes a brief appearance in a Victorian sideshow in the \"Doctor Who\" novel \"Camera Obscura\" by Lloyd Rose.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33532617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33532617", "title": "Kollyvades", "text": "Kollyvades\n\nThe Kollyvades () were the members of a movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church that began in the second half of the eighteenth century among the monastic community of Mount Athos, which was concerned with the restoration of traditional practices and opposition to unwarranted innovations, and which turned unexpectedly into a movement of spiritual regeneration. As Bishop Kallistos of Diokleia succinctly points out:\nThe movement derived its name from the Kollyva (boiled wheat) which is used during memorial services. Its proponents were Athonite monks who adhered strictly to Holy Tradition, and insisted that memorial services should not be performed on Sundays, because that is the day of the Lord's Resurrection, but rather on Saturday, the usual day for the commemoration of the dead. They were also in favor of frequent reception of Holy Communion, and practiced unceasing prayer of the heart.\n\nThe terms \"“Kollyvades”\", \"“Kollyvistai”\", and \"“Sabbatianoi”\" were epithets which were originally meant sarcastically as bitter insults, however over the passage of time these contemptuous appellations became a title or badge of honor. The leaders of the movement were Neophytos Kafsokalyvitis (1713-1784), Saint Makarios (Notaras) of Corinth (1731-1805), Saint Nicodemus of the Holy Mountain (1749-1809), and Saint Athanasios Parios (1722-1813).\n\nThe movement arose in 1754 out of a dispute within the Skete of St. Anne at Mount Athos when a group of monks objected to the scheduling of the commemoration of the dead on Sunday, the day that represented the Resurrection and Christ's victory over death, instead of Saturday or weekdays as it had been according to ancient custom. Other monks held that the commemoration of the dead has a Resurrection theme in every Liturgical celebration. While much animosity developed between the groups, the movement of the Kollyvades, as they became known, became part of an attempt to address deficiencies in spiritual life that had arisen in the Church since Byzantine times.\n\nThe first response from Constantinople to the issue of Sunday commemorations of the dead came in the form of a letter from Patriarch Theodosios II in 1772, wherein he stated that those who performed Saturday memorials did so appropriately in conformity with ancient tradition, whereas those who performed them on Sundays \"“ouch hypokeintai krimati”\" (do not sin). \n\nThis attempt at reconciliation having failed, the Patriarch’s successor, Samuel I Chatzeres (1773–1774), issued a Synodal Encyclical (1773) directing all monastics to adhere to the policies enacted by their monasteries and avoid strife over the issue of commemorations. Once more, this tactic, also in the spirit of compromise and aimed at a reconciliation of the two factions, failed.\n\nTherefore, a Synod was convened in 1774 at the Koutloumousiou Monastery, on Mount Athos, at the order of the Oecumenical Patriarch. It was composed of two former Patriarchs of Constantinople, four retired Metropolitans, two active Metropolitans, and two Bishops from Thessaloniki. There were also about two hundred monks present at the convocation. The Synod declared that all of those who did not accept the Synodal Encyclical of 1773 were subject to anathema. Despite this determination, the controversy went on.\n\nThus, in 1776, yet another Synod was convened in Constantinople, under Patriarch Sophronios II, at which the Patriarch of Jerusalem and sixteen other hierarchs were also present. It was declared by the participants that memorial services could be celebrated on either Saturday or Sunday, and that the issue was not to be discussed further. It was at this Synod that St. Athanasios Parios, Neophytos Kavsokalyvites, and St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite, among others, were excommunicated. These individuals were of course subsequently vindicated.\n\nIn addition to the issue of following proper ritualistic traditions, there was a concern for return to a Eucharistic-centered spirituality and to the precepts preached by the Hesychasts of the fourteenth century. The Kollyvades movement strove for a rediscovery of Patristic theology and a liturgical life that included frequent communion. The movement came under assault by many at Mount Athos and elsewhere, attacks that became, at times, vicious and beyond what one would expect from monastics and clergy of any rank.\n\nIn 1819 a Council at Constantinople endorsed the views of the Kollyvades fathers that Holy Communion should be partaken of regularly by clergy and faithful alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Flight Director class of 2005, of which Alibaruho is a member, is the second largest ever appointed and the most diverse. The nine-member group also included three women and two Hispanics. Leading a team of flight controllers, support personnel and engineering experts, a flight director has the overall responsibility to manage and carry out Space Shuttle flights and International Space Station expeditions. A flight director also leads and orchestrates planning and integration activities with flight controllers, payload customers, space station partners and others.\n\nAlibaruho was born to the late Dr. George Alibaruho of Uganda, and Dr. Gloria Alibaruho of Macon, Georgia. His mother is a retired university professor of social sciences, and his father is a retired economist. From his early beginnings, Alibaruho's parents encouraged his interest in mathematics and science by exposing him to printed material about rockets and about NASA as well as by exposing him to science fiction media of the time. Kwatsi is married to Macresia Alibaruho with two children. \n\n\"I caught the science bug very early from watching science fiction programs, and I wanted to learn about real science,\" Alibaruho has said. Every chance he had, he signed up for extracurricular activities and seminars where he dedicated weekends and summers to further his knowledge of science and engineering.\n\nAlibaruho earned a Bachelor of Science in Avionics in 1994 from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Post-graduation, he serviced as an ISS Life Support Systems Flight Controller (MCC Call Sign: ECLSS) from 1995–2000. During that time, Alibaruho became one of the first ECLSS officers qualified for duty in the new International Space Station Program and served on missions ISS-1A/R, STS-88/ISS-2A, STS-101/ISS-2A.2a, STS-106/ISS-2A.2b, STS-97/ISS-4A, STS-105/ISS-5A.1.\n\nIn May 2001, Alibaruho was selected as the Manager of the ISS Life Support Systems Group where he managed and trained a team of approximately 25 Flight Controllers. He served in this capacity for just over three years until he was selected as a Flight Director in February 2005.\n\nBy August 2005, Alibaruho had completed more than 700 hours of training as an International Space Station Flight Director and reported for active duty in Mission Control immediately following completion of NASA's \"Return-to-flight\" mission, STS-114 / LF-1, a flight led by his longtime mentors Paul Hill and Mark Ferring.\n\nShortly after, Alibaruho completed training as a Space Shuttle Flight Director, now qualified to manage operations on both spacecraft. During his Flight Director career, Alibaruho served as an Orbit ISS Flight Director for Assembly Missions STS-115 / ISS-12A and STS-123/ISS-1J/A. He served as an Orbit ISS Flight Director for Expeditions 11 – 28, logging literally hundreds of shifts in Mission Control.

{"id": "43099481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43099481", "title": "Librarians in North America", "text": "Librarians in North America\n\nA librarian is a person who works professionally in a library, and may hold a degree in librarianship (known either as library science or library and information science).\n\nTraditionally, a librarian is associated with collections of books, as demonstrated by the etymology of the word \"librarian\" (from the Latin \"liber\", \"book\"). The role of a librarian is continually evolving to meet social and technological needs. A modern librarian may deal provision and maintenance of information in many formats, including: physical books; electronic resources; magazines; newspapers; audio and video recordings; maps; manuscripts; photographs and other graphic material; bibliographic databases; and web-based and digital resources. A librarian may also provide other information services, including: computer provision and training; coordination with community groups to host public programs; basic literacy education; assistive technology for people with disabilities; and assistance locating community resources. Appreciation for librarians is often included by authors and scholars in the Acknowledgment sections of books.\n\nIn the 19th century, librarianship began to emerge as a true profession. Male librarians (called \"bookmen\") were found in sophisticated academic institutions around the middle of the 19th century. Like the librarians of Alexandria, these librarians were primarily scholars, not custodians of the library in which they worked. At that time there was no formal training for librarians. Education in the field was gained by experience, either self-taught or under tutelage of other librarians. Experienced librarians quite often recruited trainees. In 1872, Publishers Weekly, an instructional publication focusing on the publishing industry, began to regularly devote small sections to librarians. In 1876, The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education published \"Public Libraries in the United States of America: Their History, Condition, and Management\". Aimed at practicing librarians, the study included a manual written by notable authorities on librarianship with articles on management, administration, history, cataloging, popular reading, and library buildings.\n\nCarnegie libraries created an increased need for larger numbers of librarians to manage them, thus career library workers became an established permanent workforce.\n\nDuring this period, Melvil Dewey became a primary force in the professionalization of librarians and library education in the United States. Dewey believed that librarians are meant to provide patrons with \"better\" books to improve people and their way of life. In 1876, Dewey, Justin Winsor, Charles Ammi Cutter and other prominent librarians of the day, founded the American Library Association (ALA). The formation of this professional organization provided national visibility and recognition to the field of librarianship, while substantially strengthening the professional identity among the library practitioners. Around this time, Dewey founded the first major professional publication for librarians, \"Library Journal\". Dewey founded the first library school, The School of Library Economy, which opened at Columbia College in 1887. The coursework programs offered by the library school took three months to complete, following which students had to take an internship of up to 2 years to gain exposure to and familiarity with professional tasks.\nAfter Dewey's library school, four more library schools were opened by 1900: Albany, Pratt Institute, Drexel University, and the Armour Institute. By 1919, there were 15 more programs in the United States. These programs varied by length of program, type of degree or certificate awarded, and requirements for admission. On completion of most programs, students became Bachelors of Library Science. At the time, the degree of Master of Library Science was not awarded anywhere but Albany.\n\nIn recognition of the rise of Library education programs, ALA created the ALA Committee on Library Training in which members would review the various educational programs. This led to ALA’s \"Standards for Library Education\", which established separate standards for the different types of training programs. The neutral approach that ALA took to the Library Schools, however, influenced the schools to band together and create their own organization: the Association of American Library Schools. The Williamson Report, created for the Carnegie Corporation, however, was the most important review of library education programs. In the Williamson report, C.C. Williamson criticises the quality of many established programs, and designates a university graduate degree, not a college bachelor's degree, as the appropriate education for professional librarians. The Graduate Library School, University of Chicago, 1928-1989. was founded to respond to this need. It was thanks to the Williamson report that librarians were required to receive one year of postgraduate education in librarianship. By the 1950s most library schools in the US awarded a master's degree.\n\nIt was at this point in history that the notion of library science was established as the study for future librarians. In addition to professional librarians, faculty in Library Science programs included other academics such as sociologists and historians. Because the faculty consisted mostly of scholars, they contributed a considerable amount of research which formed the foundation of the field of library science.\n\nAnother notable progression that arose after the “Williamson Report” was the establishment of The Hampton Institute Library School, the first library school to train African-American librarians in the US. After the establishment of the Hampton Institute Library School, more African-Americans were accepted to library schools, including Edward Christopher Williams, a graduate of the New York State Library School, who went on to become the director of the library at Howard University in 1916.\n\nWith the expanding economy, the baby boom, and the important federal legislation supporting the development of education institutions and their libraries, library schools reached their heyday in the 1950s to 1960s. These factors lead to an increased need for librarians. By the 1970s, there were more than 70 accredited library schools with master’s programs in US and Canada. By 1999, however, there were only 56 ALA-accredited library school programs in the US and Canada. As library schools were never high-profile departments, these closures were a result of universities' efforts to reduce costs during the recessions of the 1980s.\n\nIn the earlier half of the 19th century, Canada had no formal training or library schools to educate potential librarians. The Toronto Public Library held competitive examinations for librarian hopefuls. The first exam was held December 15, 1887 and tested candidates on writing, arithmetic, reading, and English Literature. In 1890, an additional qualification for exam graduation was added: candidates were required to be at least 5'3\" (160 cm) tall. Successful candidates were referred to American library schools for training, or given the option of serving as apprentices to complete on-the-job training.\n\nThe starting push to establish library schools in Canada came from George Locke, chief librarian of the Toronto Public Library from 1908–1937. When Locke started his reign as chief librarian at TPL, training for librarians was still limited to on the job training. He believed, however, that librarians should be formally trained in educational programs like those of the US. He favoured librarians that had a formal educational background in librarianship. In 1909, Locke recruited Winnifred Barnstead, a Canadian graduate of a two-year training course for librarians at Princeton University, to head the cataloguing department. Locke also hired Lillian H. Smith, a Canadian graduate from the training school at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, to head the Children's department. With the help of Barnstead and Smith, Locke began his own training program through the Toronto Public Library.\n\nA contemporary of Locke was Edwin A. Hardy, secretary of the Ontario Library Association from its inception in 1901 to 1925, then as president from 1925–1926. Hardy was vocal in his opinion of formal educational training for librarians, and desperately desired a library school in Canada for fear of losing Canadian librarians trained in the US to the US. He was active in establishing library institutes, one-day regional workshops, through Ontario departments of Education, the first of which was held in Brantford, Ontario in 1907.\n\nThese institutes, however, proved insufficient, and there was a formal request for Departments of Education to begin a summer library school. The first of these summer schools ran in 1911; it was a hybrid program modelled after American schools and normal schools which educated teachers in Ontario. This program ran for four weeks in the summer when libraries were able to spare staff for training and eligible candidates were only those already employed in libraries. In 1919, it was extended to be a 3-month program and became the Ontario Library School.\n\nThe first formal library education program in Canada was established at McGill University in 1904. The McGill Summer Library School was formally founded under the jurisdiction of the University Library Committee, offering education in library administration. It was one of the first university programs in librarianship anywhere in the world outside the United States. Instrumental in the founding of the School and the establishment of its curriculum, Melvyl Dewey, a good friend and colleague of Charles Gould, University Librarian and a founder of the School, taught at the school during its first year. \n\nLibrary schools in Canada at this time, however, were unique to those in the US because many were under complete control of the Department of Education. While the Department of Education always provided funding for the library school, librarians were not able to push their own ideas or agenda. A course was established in the Ontario College of Education, located on the University of Toronto campus, to provide an academic and professional compliment to the already established technical training of librarians. Barnstead became the first director, but all financial, hiring, and curriculum matters were made by the Dean of the College of Education and the Minister of Education. Graduates of the program did not receive a degree; they received a librarian's certificate from the Minister of Education and a diploma from the University of Toronto.\n\nIt was not until the 1930s that the library school became a separate entity from the Department and Ministry of Education. In 1937, the library school at the University of Toronto received ALA accreditation and Canadian students began to receive a professional degree – the Bachelor of Library Science.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "459375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=459375", "title": "Lithuanians", "text": "Lithuanians\n\nLithuanians (, singular \"lietuvis/lietuvė\") are a Baltic ethnic group, native to Lithuania, where they number around 2,561,300 people. Another million or more make up the Lithuanian diaspora, largely found in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Russia, United Kingdom and Ireland. Their native language is Lithuanian, one of only two surviving members of the Baltic language family. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Most Lithuanians belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while the Lietuvininkai who lived in the northern part of East Prussia prior to World War II, were mostly Evangelical Lutherans.\n\nThe territory of the Balts, including modern Lithuania, was once inhabited by several Baltic tribal entities (Aukštaitians, Sudovians, Old Lithuanians, Curonians, Semigallians, Selonians, Samogitians, Skalvians, Old Prussians (\"Nadruvians\")), as attested by ancient sources and dating from prehistoric times. Over the centuries, and especially under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, some of these tribes consolidated into the Lithuanian nation, mainly as a defence against the marauding Teutonic Order and Eastern Slavs. The last Pagan peoples in Europe, they were eventually converted to Christianity in 1387.\n\nThe territory inhabited by the ethnic Lithuanians has shrunk over centuries; once Lithuanians made up a majority of the population not only in what is now Lithuania, but also in northwestern Belarus, in large areas of the territory of the modern Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, and in some parts of modern Latvia and Poland.\n\nHowever, there is a current argument that the Lithuanian language was considered non-prestigious enough by some elements in Lithuanian society, and a preference for the Polish language in certain territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well as a preference for the German language in territories of the former East Prussia (now Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia) caused the number of Lithuanian speakers to decrease. The subsequent imperial Russian occupation accelerated this process; it pursued a policy of Russification, which included a ban on public speaking and writing in Lithuanian (see, e.g., Knygnešiai, the actions against the Catholic Church). It was believed by some at the time that the nation as such, along with its language, would become extinct within a few generations.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century a Lithuanian cultural and linguistic revival occurred. Some of the Polish- and Belarusian-speaking persons from the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania expressed their affiliation with the modern Lithuanian nation in the early 20th century, including Michał Pius Römer, Stanisław Narutowicz, Oscar Milosz and Tadas Ivanauskas. Lithuania declared independence after World War I, which helped its national consolidation. A standardised Lithuanian language was approved. However, the eastern parts of Lithuania, including the Vilnius Region, were annexed by Poland, while the Klaipėda Region was taken over by Nazi Germany in 1939. In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union, and forced to join it as the Lithuanian SSR. The Germans and their allies attacked the USSR in June 1941, and from 1941—1944, Lithuania was occupied by Germany. The Germans retreated in 1944, and Lithuania fell under Soviet rule once again. The long-standing communities of Lithuanians in the Kaliningrad Oblast (\"Lithuania Minor\") were almost destroyed as a result.\n\nThe Lithuanian nation as such remained primarily in Lithuania, few villages in northeastern Poland, southern Latvia and also in the diaspora of emigrants. Some indigenous Lithuanians still remain in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, but their number is small compared to what they used to be. Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, and was recognized by most countries in 1991. It became a member of the European Union on May 1, 2004.\n\nAmong the Baltic states, Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups such as Ukrainians, Jews, Germans, Tatars, Latvians, Romani, Estonians, Crimean Karaites, Scandinavians etc.\n\nPoles are mostly concentrated in the Vilnius Region. Especially large Polish communities are located in the Vilnius District Municipality and the Šalčininkai District Municipality. This concentration allows Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, an ethnic minority-based political party, to exert political influence. Due to the excessive pro-Pole political agenda, the party is known to cause friction between Lithuanians and Poles. However, it has only held 1 or 2 seats in the parliament of Lithuania for the past decade. Thus, it is more active in local politics by having a majority in a few minor municipality councils.\n\nRussians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and do not have a strong political party. The most prominent community lives in the Visaginas Municipality (52%). Most of them are workers who moved from Russia to work at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.\n\nIn the past, the ethnic composition of Lithuania has varied dramatically. The most prominent change was the extermination of the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Before World War II, about 7.5% of the population was Jewish; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, which was sometimes nicknamed the northern Jerusalem, was about 30% Jewish. Almost all its Jews were killed during the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, some 75,000 alone between the years 1941 – 1942, while others later immigrated to the United States and Israel. Now there are about 3,200 Jews living in Lithuania.\n\nApart from the various religious and ethnic groups currently residing in Lithuania, Lithuanians themselves retain and differentiate between their regional identities; there are 5 historic regional groups: \"Žemaičiai\", \"Suvalkiečiai\", \"Aukštaičiai\", \"Dzūkai\" and \"Prūsai\", the last of which is virtually extinct. City dwellers are usually considered just Lithuanians, especially ones from large cities such as Vilnius or Kaunas.\nThe four groups are delineated according to certain region-specific traditions, dialects, and historical divisions. There are some stereotypes used in jokes about these subgroups, for example, Sudovians are supposedly frugal while Samogitians are stubborn.\n\nSince the Neolithic period the native inhabitants of the Lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside, so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements, although without being actually isolated from them. The Lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous, without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups.\n\nA 2004 analysis of mtDNA in a Lithuanian population revealed that Lithuanians are close to both Indo-European and Uralic-speaking populations of Northern Europe. Y-chromosome SNP haplogroup analysis showed Lithuanians to be closest to Balts, Russians, Belarusians and Finnish people. Autosomal SNP analysis situates Lithuanians most proximal to Latvians, followed by the East Slavs, furthermore, all Slavic peoples and Germans are situated more proximal to Lithuanians than Finns and northern Russians.\n\nLithuanian Ashkenazi Jews also have interesting genetics, since they display a number of unique genetic characteristics; the utility of these variations has been the subject of debate. One variation, which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century, corresponding to the establishment of Ashkenazi settlements in response to the invitation extended by Vytautas the Great in 1388.\n\nLithuanians, like most other Baltic/Scandinavian cultures, have been known for being people of above average height. At the end of the 19th century, the average height of males was and the average height of females was . By the end of the 20th century, heights averaged for males and for females.\n\nLithuanian settlement extends into adjacent countries that are now outside the modern Lithuanian state. A small Lithuanian community exists in the vicinity of Puńsk and Sejny in the Suwałki area of Poland, an area associated with the Lithuanian writer and cleric Antanas Baranauskas. Although most of the Lithuanian inhabitants in the region of Lithuania Minor that formed part of East Prussia were expelled when the area was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Kaliningrad Oblast, small groups of Lithuanians subsequently settled that area as it was repopulated with new Soviet citizens.\n\nApart from the traditional communities in Lithuania and its neighboring countries, Lithuanians have emigrated to other continents during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n\nThe Lithuanian national sport is usually considered to be basketball (\"krepšinis\"), which is popular among Lithuanians in Lithuania as well as in the diasporic communities. Basketball came to Lithuania through the Lithuanian-American community in the 1930s. Lithuanian basketball teams were bronze medal winners in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics.\n\nJoninės (also known as Rasos) is a traditional national holiday, celebrated on the summer solstice. It has pagan origins. Užgavėnės (Shrove Tuesday) takes place on the day before Ash Wednesday, and is meant to urge the retreat of winter. There are also national traditions for Christian holidays such as Easter and Christmas.\n\nLithuanian cuisine has much in common with other European cuisines and features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's rich history.\n\nSince shared similarities in history and heritage, Lithuanians, Jews and Poles have developed many similar dishes and beverages: dumplings ( \"koldūnai\"), doughnuts (\"spurgos\"), and crepes (\"lietiniai blynai\"). German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (kugelis) and potato sausages (vėdarai), as well as the baroque tree cake known as šakotis. Traditional dishes of Lithuanian Tatars and Lithuanian Karaites like Kibinai and čeburekai, that are similar to pasty, are popular in Lithuania.\n\nFor Lithuanian Americans both traditional Lithuanian dishes of virtinukai (cabbage and noodles) and balandėliai (rolled cabbage) are growing increasingly more popular.\n\nThere are also regional cuisine dishes, e.g. traditional kastinys in Žemaitija, Western Lithuania, Skilandis in Western and Central Lithuania, Kindziukas in Eastern and Southern Lithuania (Dzūkija).\n\nCepelinai, a stuffed potato creation, is the most popular national dish. It is popular among Lithuanians all over the world. Other national foods include dark rye bread, cold beet soup (šaltibarščiai), and kugelis (a baked potato pudding). Some of these foods are also common in neighboring countries. Lithuanian cuisine is generally unknown outside Lithuanian communities. Most Lithuanian restaurants outside Lithuania are located in cities with a heavy Lithuanian presence.\n\nLithuanians in the early 20th century were among the thinnest people in the developed countries of the world. In Lithuanian cuisine there is some emphasis on attractive presentation of freshly prepared foods.\n\nLithuanian ancestors Balts were using Midus a type of Lithuanian Mead for thousands of years.\n\nLocally brewed beer (\"alus\"), vodka (\"degtinė\"), and kvass (\"gira\") are popular drinks in Lithuania. Lithuanian traditional beer of Northern Lithuania, Biržai, Pasvalys regions is well appreciated in Lithuania and abroad. Starka is a part of the Lithuanian heritage, still produced in Lithuania.\n\nWhen the ban against printing the Lithuanian language was lifted in 1904, various European literary movements such as Symbolism, impressionism, and expressionism each in turn influenced the work of Lithuanian writers. The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918–40) gave them the opportunity to examine themselves and their characters more deeply, as their primary concerns were no longer political. An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, a novelist and dramatist. His many works include \"Dainavos šalies senų žmonių padavimai\" (Old Folks Tales of Dainava, 1912) and the historical dramas \"Šarūnas\" (1911), \"Skirgaila\" (1925), and \"Mindaugo mirtis\" (The Death of Mindaugas, 1935). Petras Vaičiūnas was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s. Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas wrote lyric poetry, plays, and novels, including the novel \"Altorių šešėly\" (In the Shadows of the Altars, 3 vol., 1933), a remarkably powerful autobiographical novel.\n\n\"Keturi vėjai\" movement started with publication of \"The Prophet of the Four Winds\" by talented poet Kazys Binkis (1893—1942). It was rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of \"Keturi vėjai\" initially was futurism which arrived through Russia from the West and later cubism, dadaism, surrealism, unanimism, and German expressionism. The most influensive futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky.\n\nOskaras Milašius (1877–1939) is a paradoxical and interesting phenomenon in Lithuanian culture. He never lived in Lithuania but was born and spent his childhood in Cereja (near Mogilev, Belarus) and graduated from Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris. His longing for his fatherland was more metaphysical. Having to choose between two conflicting countries — Lithuania and Poland — he preferred Lithuania which for him was an idea even more than a fatherland. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was appointed officially as Chargé d'Affaires for Lithuania. He published: 1928, a collection of 26 Lithuanian songs; 1930, \"Lithuanian Tales and Stories\"; 1933, \"Lithuanian Tales\"; 1937, \"The origin of the Lithuanian Nation\".\n\nLithuanian folk music is based around songs (\"dainos\"), which include romantic and wedding songs, as well as work songs and archaic war songs. These songs used to be performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel chords or unison. Duophonic songs are common in the renowned sutartinės tradition of Aukštaitija. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called rateliai, a kind of round dance. Instrumentation includes kanklės, a kind of zither that accompanies sutartinės, rateliai, waltzes, quadrilles and polkas, and fiddles, (including a bass fiddle called the \"basetle\") and a kind of whistle called the \"lumzdelis\"; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the concertina, accordion and bandoneon. Sutartinė can be accompanied by \"skudučiai\", a form of panpipes played by a group of people, as well as wooden trumpets (\"ragai\" and \"dandytės\"). Kanklės is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of strings and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include \"švilpas\" whistle, drums and \"tabalas\" (a percussion instrument like a gong), \"sekminių ragelis\" (bagpipe) and the \"pūslinė\", a musical bow made from a pig’s bladder filled with dried peas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18002", "title": "Louisa May Alcott", "text": "Louisa May Alcott\n\nLouisa May Alcott (; November 29, 1832March 6, 1888) was an American novelist and poet best known as the author of the novel \"Little Women\" (1868) and its sequels \"Little Men\" (1871) and \"Jo's Boys\" (1886). Raised in New England by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott, she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\nAlcott's family suffered from financial difficulties, and while she worked to help support the family from an early age, she also sought an outlet in writing. She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s. Early in her career, she sometimes used the pen name A. M. Barnard, under which she wrote novels for young adults that focused on spies, revenge, and crossdressers.\n\nPublished in 1868, \"Little Women\" is set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts, and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters. The novel was very well received and is still a popular children's novel today, filmed several times.\n\nAlcott was an abolitionist and a feminist and remained unmarried throughout her life. She died from a stroke, two days after her father died, in Boston on March 6, 1888.\n\nLouisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, in Germantown, which is now part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on her father's 33rd birthday. She was the daughter of transcendentalist and educator Amos Bronson Alcott and social worker Abby May and the second of four daughters: Anna Bronson Alcott was the eldest; Elizabeth Sewall Alcott and Abigail May Alcott were the two youngest. The family moved to Boston in 1834, where Alcott's father established an experimental school and joined the Transcendental Club with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Bronson Alcott's opinions on education and tough views on child-rearing shaped young Alcott's mind with a desire to achieve perfection, a goal of the transcendentalists. His attitudes towards Alcott's wild and independent behavior, and his inability to provide for his family, created conflict between Bronson Alcott and his wife and daughters.\n\nIn 1840, after several setbacks with the school, the Alcott family moved to a cottage on of land, situated along the Sudbury River in Concord, Massachusetts. The three years they spent at the rented Hosmer Cottage were described as idyllic. By 1843, the Alcott family moved, along with six other members of the Consociate Family, to the Utopian Fruitlands community for a brief interval in 1843–1844. After the collapse of the Utopian Fruitlands, they moved on to rented rooms and finally, with Abigail May Alcott's inheritance and financial help from Emerson, they purchased a homestead in Concord. They moved into the home they named \"Hillside\" on April 1, 1845, but moved in 1852, selling to Nathaniel Hawthorne who renamed it The Wayside. Moving 22 times in 30 years, the Alcotts returned to Concord once again in 1857 and moved into Orchard House, a two-story clapboard farmhouse, in the spring of 1858.\nAlcott's early education included lessons from the naturalist Henry David Thoreau who inspired her to write \"Thoreau's Flute\" based on her time at Walden's Pond. Most of the education she received though, came from her father who was strict and believed in \"the sweetness of self-denial.\" She also received some instruction from writers and educators such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, and Julia Ward Howe, all of whom were family friends. She later described these early years in a newspaper sketch entitled \"Transcendental Wild Oats.\" The sketch was reprinted in the volume \"Silver Pitchers\" (1876), which relates the family's experiment in \"plain living and high thinking\" at Fruitlands.\n\nPoverty made it necessary for Alcott to go to work at an early age as a teacher, seamstress, governess, domestic helper, and writer. Her sisters also supported the family, working as seamstresses, while their mother took on social work among the Irish immigrants. Only the youngest, May, was able to attend public school. Due to all of these pressures, writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Alcott. Her first book was \"Flower Fables\" (1849), a selection of tales originally written for Ellen Emerson, daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Alcott is quoted as saying \"I wish I was rich, I was good, and we were all a happy family this day\" and was driven in life not to be poor.\n\nIn 1847, she and her family served as station masters on the Underground Railroad, when they housed a fugitive slave for one week and had discussions with Frederick Douglass. Alcott read and admired the \"Declaration of Sentiments\", published by the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights, advocating for women's suffrage and became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts in a school board election. The 1850s were hard times for the Alcotts, and in 1854 Louisa found solace at the Boston Theatre where she wrote The Rival Prima Donnas, which she later burned due to a quarrel between the actresses on who would play what role. At one point in 1857, unable to find work and filled with such despair, Alcott contemplated suicide. During that year, she read Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Brontë and found many parallels to her own life. In 1858, her younger sister Elizabeth died, and her older sister Anna married a man named John Pratt. This felt, to Alcott, to be a breaking up of their sisterhood.\n\nAs an adult, Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist. In 1860, Alcott began writing for the \"Atlantic Monthly\". When the American Civil War broke out, she served as a nurse in the Union Hospital at Georgetown, DC, for six weeks in 1862–1863. She intended to serve three months as a nurse, but halfway through she contracted typhoid and became deathly ill, though she eventually recovered. Her letters homerevised and published in the Boston anti-slavery paper \"Commonwealth\" and collected as \"Hospital Sketches\" (1863, republished with additions in 1869)brought her first critical recognition for her observations and humor. She wrote about the mismanagement of hospitals and the indifference and callousness of some of the surgeons she encountered. Her main character, Tribulation Periwinkle, showed a passage from innocence to maturity and is a \"serious and eloquent witness\". Her novel \"Moods\" (1864), based on her own experience, was also promising.\n\nIn the mid-1860s, Alcott wrote passionate, fiery novels and sensational stories under the nom de plume A. M. Barnard. Among these are \"A Long Fatal Love Chase\" and \"Pauline's Passion and Punishment\". Her protagonists for these books are strong and smart. She also produced stories for children, and after they became popular, she did not go back to writing for adults. Other books she wrote are the novelette \"A Modern Mephistopheles\" (1875), which people thought Julian Hawthorne wrote, and the semi-autobiographical novel \"Work\" (1873).\n\nAlcott became even more successful with the first part of \"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy\" (1868), a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts, published by the Roberts Brothers. Part two, or \"Part Second\", also known as \"Good Wives\" (1869), followed the March sisters into adulthood and marriage. \"Little Men\" (1871) detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of \"Little Women\". \"Jo's Boys\" (1886) completed the \"March Family Saga\".\n\nIn \"Little Women\", Alcott based her heroine \"Jo\" on herself. But whereas Jo marries at the end of the story, Alcott remained single throughout her life. She explained her \"spinsterhood\" in an interview with Louise Chandler Moulton, \"I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man's soul put by some freak of nature into a woman's body ... because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.\" However, Alcott's romance while in Europe with the young Polish man Ladislas \"Laddie\" Wisniewski was detailed in her journals but then deleted by Alcott herself before her death. Alcott identified Laddie as the model for Laurie in \"Little Women\". Likewise, every character seems to be paralleled to some extent, from Beth's death mirroring Lizzie's to Jo's rivalry with the youngest, Amy, as Alcott felt a sort of rivalry for (Abigail) May, at times. Though Alcott never married, she did take in May's daughter, Louisa, after May's death in 1879 from childbed fever, caring for little \"Lulu\" until her death.\n\n\"Little Women\" was well received, with critics and audiences finding it suitable for many age groups. A reviewer of \"Eclectic Magazine\" called it \"the very best of books to reach the hearts of the young of any age from six to sixty\". It was a fresh, natural representation of daily life. With the success of \"Little Women\", Alcott shied away from the attention and would sometimes act as a servant when fans would come to her house.\nAlong with Elizabeth Stoddard, Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and others, Alcott was part of a group of female authors during the Gilded Age, who addressed women's issues in a modern and candid manner. Their works were, as one newspaper columnist of the period commented, \"among the decided 'signs of the times'\".\n\nAfter her youngest sister May died in 1879, Louisa took over for the care of niece, Lulu, who was named after Louisa. Alcott suffered chronic health problems in her later years, including vertigo. She and her earliest biographers attributed her illness and death to mercury poisoning. During her American Civil War service, Alcott contracted typhoid fever and was treated with a compound containing mercury. Recent analysis of Alcott's illness, however, suggests that her chronic health problems may have been associated with an autoimmune disease, not mercury exposure. Moreover, a late portrait of Alcott shows a rash on her cheeks, which is a characteristic of lupus.\n\nAlcott died of a stroke at age 55 in Boston, on March 6, 1888, two days after her father's death. Lulu, her niece was only 8 years old when Louisa died. Louisa's last known words were \"Is it not meningitis?\" She is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, near Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau, on a hillside now known as \"Authors' Ridge\".\n\nLouisa frequently wrote in her journals about going on runs up until she died. She challenged the social norms regarding gender by encouraging her young female readers to run as well.\n\nHer Boston home is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Her childhood home Orchard House is now a museum that pays homage to Louisa May Alcott and her family that focuses on education. In addition, Harriet Reisen wrote \"Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind \"Little Women\"\" which later became a film that was directed by Nancy Porter and aired on PBS television. In 1996 Alcott was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nThere is a Part Second of \"Little Women\", also known as \"Good Wives\", published in 1869; and afterward published together with \"Little Women\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\nArchival Materials\n\nOther\n"}

A Republican, he served for 30 years as a United States Senator from Oregon, and also as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. A native Oregonian, he served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater during World War II after graduating from Willamette University. After the war he earned a graduate degree from Stanford University before returning to Oregon and Willamette as a professor.\n\nWhile still teaching, Hatfield served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. He won election to the Oregon Secretary of State's office at the age of 34 and two years later was elected as the 29th Governor of Oregon. He was the youngest person to ever serve in either of those offices, and served two terms as governor before election to the United States Senate. In the Senate he served for 30 years, and now holds the record for longest tenure of any Senator from Oregon. At the time of his retirement, he was 7th most senior Senator as well as second most senior Republican. In 1968, he was considered a candidate to be Richard Nixon's running mate for the Republican Party presidential ticket.\n\nHatfield served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations on two different occasions. With this role, he was able to direct funding to Oregon and research-related projects. Several Oregon institutions, buildings and facilities are named in his honor, including the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse in Portland, the Mark O. Hatfield Library at Willamette University (his alma mater), the Hatfield Government Center light-rail station in Hillsboro, the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government in the College of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University, and the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport. Outside of Oregon, a research center at the National Institutes of Health is also named in his honor for his support of medical research while in the Senate. Hatfield died in Portland on August 7, 2011, after a long illness.\n\nHatfield was born in Dallas, Oregon, on July 12, 1922, the only son of Dovie E. (Odom) Hatfield, a schoolteacher, and Charles Dolen Hatfield, a blacksmith for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Hatfield's father was from California and his mother from Tennessee. When he was five years old, his maternal grandmother took over the household while his mother, Dovie attended Oregon State College (now Oregon State University) and graduated with a teaching degree after four years. Dovie taught school in Dallas for two years before the family moved to Salem, where she taught junior high school.\n\nEncouraged by his mother, Hatfield's first experience with politics came at the age of 10, when he campaigned in his neighborhood for President Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. In the late 1930s Hatfield worked as a tour guide at the new Oregon State Capitol Building in Salem, using his key to enter the governor's office, where he sat in the governor's chair.\n\nOn June 10, 1940, the 17-year-old Hatfield, driving his mother's car, struck and killed a pedestrian, Alice Marie Lane, as she crossed the street. Hatfield was not held criminally liable for the crash, but was found civilly liable to the family. The case made its way to the Oregon Supreme Court in 1943, with the court affirming the trial court's decision.\n\nHatfield graduated from Salem High School (now North Salem High School) in 1940 and then enrolled at Willamette University, also in Salem. While attending Willamette, Hatfield became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega and Kappa Gamma Rho, which he later helped become a chapter of Beta Theta Pi. (In 1964, Hatfield was elected to the National position of Third Vice President of Alpha Phi Omega). In college he also worked part-time for then Oregon Secretary of State Earl Snell, where he learned how to build a political base by sending out messages to potential voters after reading about life changes posted in newspapers, such as deaths and graduations. He also sketched out a political career path beginning with the state legislature and culminating in a spot in the United States Senate, with a blank for any position beyond the Senate. Hatfield graduated from Willamette in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree after three years at the school. While at the school he lost his only election, for student body president.\n\nHatfield joined the U.S. Navy after graduation, taking part in the World War II battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa as a landing craft officer where he witnessed the carnage of the war. A lieutenant, he also witnessed the effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as one of the first Americans to see the ruins of the city (later, as Senator, Hatfield opposed arms proliferation and the Vietnam War). After Japan, he served in French Indochina, where he witnessed firsthand the wealth divide between the peasant Vietnamese and the colonial French bourgeoisie. After his discharge, he spent one year at Willamette’s law school, but decided politics or teaching better suited him.\n\nHatfield then enrolled at Stanford University, where he obtained a master's degree in political science in 1948. He returned to Salem and Willamette after Stanford and began working as an assistant professor in political science. During his tenure as professor, he built a political base by sending out messages and speaking at any public forum where he could get an invitation.\n\nMark Hatfield's career in public office spanned five decades as he held office in both the legislative and executive branches of Oregon's state government, including two terms as governor. On the national stage he became the longest serving U.S. Senator from Oregon and a candidate for the Republican Vice Presidential nomination in 1968. In the U.S. Senate he would twice serve as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and twice be investigated for possible ethics violations.\n\nIn 1950 while teaching political science and serving as dean of students at Willamette, Hatfield began his political career by winning election to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican. He defeated six others for the seat at a time when state assembly elections were still determined by county-wide votes. He served for two terms representing Marion County and Salem in the lower chamber of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. At the time he was the youngest legislator in Oregon and still lived at his parents' home. Hatfield would teach early-morning classes and then walk across the street to the Capitol to legislate.\n\nIn 1952 he won re-election to his seat in the Oregon House. He also received national attention for his early support for coaxing Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for President of the United States as a Republican. This earned him a spot as a delegate at the Republican National Convention that year.\n\nWhile in college he saw firsthand the discrimination against African Americans in Salem when he was tasked by his fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, after a dinner with driving their guest, black artist Paul Robeson back to Portland, as African Americans were prohibited from staying in hotels in Salem. In 1953, he introduced and passed legislation in the House that prohibited discrimination based on race in public accommodations before federal legislation and court decisions did so on a national level. In 1954, Hatfield ran and won a seat in the Oregon State Senate representing Marion County. While in the legislature, he continued to apply the grassroots strategy he learned from Earl Snell, but expanded it to cover the entire state to increase his political base.\n\nAfter serving in the state senate, he became the youngest secretary of state in Oregon history after winning election in 1956 at age 34. Hatfield defeated fellow state senator Monroe Sweetland for the office, receiving 51.3% of the vote in the November general election. He took office on January 7, 1957, and remained until he resigned on January 12, 1959.\n\nFor his first run for Governor of Oregon in 1958, the Republican Party opposed his candidacy going into the primary election. The large political base he had cultivated allowed him to win the party's primary despite the party's opposition. In the primary he defeated Oregon State Treasurer Sig Unander for the Republican nomination. In July 1958, after the primary election, Hatfield married Antoinette Kuzmanich, a counselor at Portland State College (now Portland State University). The marriage during the campaign drew some attention as the Catholic Kuzmanich converted to Hatfield's Baptist religion. The couple would have four children: Elizabeth, Mark Jr., Theresa and Charles (\"Visko\"). He continued his campaign for the governor's office after the wedding, but avoided most public appearances with fellow Republican candidates for office and did not mention them during his campaign, despite requests by other Republicans for joint appearances.\n\nIn the November general election Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes. In the final days of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17. This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments, as did Holmes and other Democrats. Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election. That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878. Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education. After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, who would have to resign to become governor. Hatfield appointed Howell Appling, Jr. to the office, and O'Hara challenged the appointment in state court. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue, with the appointment of Appling confirmed. He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.\n\nIn 1962 Hatfield had been considered a possible candidate to run against Morse for his Senate seat, but Hatfield instead ran for re-election. He faced Oregon Attorney General Robert Y. Thornton in the general election, winning with 345,497 votes to Thorton's 265,359. He became the state's first two-term governor in the 20th century when he was re-elected in 1962, and later became only the second governor up to that point in the state's history to serve two full-terms.\n\nHatfield gave the keynote speech at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco that nominated Barry Goldwater and served as temporary chairman of the party during the convention. He advocated a moderate approach for the party and opposed the extreme conservatism associated with Goldwater and his supporters. He also was the only governor to vote against a resolution by the National Governors' Conference supporting the Johnson Administration's policy on the Vietnam War, as Hatfield opposed the war, but pledged \"unqualified and complete support\" for the troops. He preferred the use of economic sanctions to end the war.\n\nHatfield was a popular Governor who supported Oregon's traditional industries of timber and agriculture, but felt that in the postwar era expansion of industry and funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities. While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state's economy, such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions. As part of the initiative, he helped to found the Oregon Graduate Center in what is now the Silicon Forest in Washington County in 1963. A graduate level school in the Portland area (Portland State was still a college with no graduate programs at this time) was seen by business leaders as essential to attracting new industries and by Tektronix as needed to retain highly skilled workers. In lieu of the standard portrait for former governors, Hatfield is represented by a marble bust at the Oregon State Capitol.\n\nLimited to two terms as governor, Hatfield announced his candidacy in the 1966 U.S. Senate election for the seat vacated by the retiring Maurine Neuberger. During the Vietnam War, and during an election year, he was the only person to vote against a resolution by a governors' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966. At that time the war was supported by 75 percent of the public, and was also supported by Hatfield's opponent in the November election. He won the primary election with 178,782 votes compared to a combined 56,760 votes for three opponents. Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman Robert Duncan in the election. In order to finish his term as governor, which ended on January 9, 1967, he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3.\n\nHatfield's re-election victory for governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal, after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.\n\nAs a senator Hatfield took positions that made him hard to classify politically. In the Summer of 1969, he had told Murray Rothbard that he had \"committed himself to the cause of libertarianism.\" Rothbard remarked concerning Hatfield, \"obviously his voting record is not particularly libertarian—it's very good on foreign policy and the draft, but it's not too great on other things\", adding that \"in the abstract, at least, he is very favorable to libertarianism.\" Hatfield was pro-life on the issues of abortion and the death penalty, though as governor he chose not to commute the sentence of a convicted murderer and allowed that execution to go forward. As a prominent evangelical Christian, he opposed government-sponsored school prayer and supported civil rights for minorities.\n\nIn 1970, with Senator George McGovern (D-South Dakota), he co-sponsored the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment, which called for a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam. In 1973 he explained to the Eugene Register-Guard his \"Neighborhood Government Act\" which he repeatedly introduced in congress. It would have permitted Americans to divert their personal federal tax money from Washington to their local community. He explained that his long-term goal was to have all social services provided at the neighborhood level.\nIn 1981, Hatfield served as the chairman of the Congressional Joint Committee on Presidential Inaugurations, overseeing the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in January of that year.\n\nOn December 2, 1981, Hatfield was one of four senators to vote against an amendment to President Reagan's MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration.\n\nIn the 1980s, Hatfield co-sponsored nuclear freeze legislation with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, as well as co-authoring a book on the topic. He also advocated for the closure of the N-Reactor at the Hanford Nuclear Site in the 1980s, though he was a supporter of nuclear fusion programs. The N-Reactor was used for producing weapons grade plutonium while producing electricity.\n\nHatfield frequently broke with his party on issues of national defense and foreign policy in support for non-interventionism, such as military spending and the ban on travel to Cuba, while often siding with them on environmental and conservation issues. Senator Hatfield supported increased logging on federal lands. He was the lone Republican to vote against the 1981 fiscal year's appropriations bill for the Department of Defense. He was rated as the sixth most respected senator in a 1987 survey by fellow senators. In 1991, Hatfield voted against authorizing military action against Iraq in the Gulf War, one of only two members of his party to do so in the Senate.\n\nHatfield was sometimes referred to as \"Saint Mark\". In 1984, columnist Jack Anderson revealed that Mrs. Hatfield, a realtor, had been paid $55,000 in fees by Greek arms dealer Basil Tsakos. Tsakos had been lobbying Hatfield, then Appropriations Chairman, for funding for a $6 billion trans-African pipeline. The Hatfields apologized and donated the money to a Portland hospital. One year after his death, in 2011, it was revealed that the $55,000 had actually been given to his wife Antoinette Hatfield to win the senator's support for construction of a trans-Africa oil pipeline.\n\nIn 1991, it was also revealed that Hatfield had failed to report a number of expensive gifts from the president of the University of South Carolina, James B. Holderman. Again, he apologized. But the Senate's Ethics Committee rebuked Hatfield for the latter act.\n\nHatfield received another rebuke from the Senate after the Ethics Committee investigated two gifts that he had received in the form of forgiven loans from a former congressman and a California businessman.\nHis final re-election campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield as out of touch on issues such as abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1 million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7 percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2 percent) votes.\n\nIn 1993, he became the longest-serving senator from Oregon, surpassing the record of 9,726 days in office previously held by Charles McNary. In 1995, Hatfield was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the proposed balanced budget amendment, and was the deciding vote that prevented the passage of the bill. In 1996 the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, a group he served on previously, granted him their Distinguished Service Award.\n\nHatfield retired in 1996, having never lost an election in 46 years and 11 campaigns as an elected official. During his tenure he gained billions of dollars in the form of federal appropriations for projects in Oregon. This included funding for transportation projects, environmental protection of wilderness areas and scenic rivers, research facilities, and health care facilities.\n\nAfter retiring from political office, he returned to Oregon and teaching, joining the faculty of George Fox University in Newberg, Oregon. In 2006, he was named the Herbert Hoover Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Politics at the school. Additionally, he taught at the Hatfield School of Government at Portland State University, which is named in his honor, and lectured at Willamette University and Lewis & Clark College while living in Portland.\n\nIn July 1999, Hatfield and his wife were passengers on a tour bus when a car collided with the bus. They received only minor injuries, but the experience led them to advocate for seat belts to be required on buses.\n\nNumerous buildings, organizations, awards, and outdoor areas have been named in honor of Hatfield. These include:\nWork is underway to start a Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail in the Columbia River Gorge, a 60-mile trail through much of the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness area.\n\nFrom February 2000 to May 2008 Hatfield served on the board of directors for Oregon Health & Science University. His papers and book collection are stored in the Willamette University Archives and Special Collections, inside the Mark O. Hatfield Library. Senator Hatfield merited his own chapter in Tom Brokaw's \"The Greatest Generation\".\n\nIn 2014, a 90-minute documentary about Hatfield's Life and Career called \"The Gentleman of the Senate: Oregon's Mark Hatfield\" was released.\n\nHatfield was admitted to the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research hospital at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland in November 2010 for observation after his health began to decline. Mark Hatfield died at a care facility in Portland on August 7, 2011, after several years of illness. A specific cause of death was not immediately given.\n\nA selection of items Hatfield authored or contributed to:\n\n\n\n\n"}

After her father died, she left school in the 4th grade to work as a maid in La Boca. She was introduced to the tango by her elder sister known as La Ñata.\n\nNieves and Juan Carlos Copes brought the tango and the milonga to audiences throughout the world. By 1956 Nieves and Copes had created a dance based on music by Astor Piazzolla but it was after touring through Central America, Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico and Cuba that they were asked to meet Piazzolla in Mexico City. The three of them shared tango music and got on well together. They flew to Puerto Rico in October 1959 where they packed out Club Flamboyan in San Juan with \"Companina Argentina Tangolandia\". Piazzolla was serving as the musical director and he dreamt of taking them to North America. The tour continued in New York, Chicago and then Washington. The last show that the three of them did together was an appearance on CBS the only colour TV channel in the US. They featured on The Arthur Murray Party in April 1960.\n\nThey continued to be dance partners for decades. In the 1980s, they created and starred in \"Tango Argentino\". The show's run had to be extended as Nieves and Copes had been only booked for a week. It moved to another theatre in October and continued there until the following year. With different dancers, it went on for a number of years in New York. In 1986, it received Tony Award nominations for best musical, best director, and best choreographer, and during the 40th Tony Awards show a dance excerpt from \"Tango Argentino\" was performed. The book \"The tango in the United States : a history\" incorrectly reported that the show had won a tony Award.\n\nNieves and Copes went on tour with \"Tango Argentino\" in 1999 before starring in \"Tanguera\" (2002) in Buenos Aires, New York, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and then in the West End (2010). Nieves was given the role of the brothel keeper as she is thought of as essential to a tango production.\n\nNow in her late 70s, María Nieves offers a simple explanation for her success despite never having had a dancing lesson: \"The first time I danced the tango, it entered my skin through my feet, passed from my skin to my blood and through my blood to my heart. It requires no acrobatics, you simply have to devote yourself to your heartbeat.\"\n"}
{"id": "36627336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36627336", "title": "Megaupload legal case", "text": "Megaupload legal case\n\nThe Megaupload legal case concerns a number of related criminal indictments and enforcement actions taken against Megaupload owner Kim Dotcom in various jurisdictions. On 19 January 2012 the United States Department of Justice seized and shut down the file-hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. On 20 January 2012 Hong Kong Customs froze more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars (US$39 million) in assets belonging to the company.\n\nActing upon a US Federal prosecutor's request, the New Zealand Police arrested Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives in a leased $30 million mansion at Coatesville near Auckland on Friday, 20 January 2012 (NZDT, UTC+13). This was pursuant to a request from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that the four be extradited for racketeering and money laundering. The raid was timed for the birthday celebration of Dotcom. Assets worth $17 million including art works and cars were seized. The four men arrested were Kim Dotcom (founder; 38 years old, from Germany), Finn Batato (Chief marketing officer (CMO); 38, from Germany), Mathias Ortmann (Chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder; 40, from Germany) and Bram van der Kolk (29, from the Netherlands). The number of police officers involved in this operation was about 80 according to Dotcom or 20 to 30 according to the New Zealand police.\n\nOn 23 January, Dotcom appeared in Auckland's North Shore District Court for a bail hearing. The crown argued against bail on the basis that he was a flight risk with a helicopter on his front lawn, while defence lawyers argued that the helicopter could not fly far enough to reach another country. They also said that Dotcom denied any criminal wrongdoing. Judge David McNaughton expressed concern at the discovery of two shotguns at Dotcom's mansion during the police raid, and deferred a decision on whether to grant bail, saying that he needed more time to review the submissions. The request for bail was turned down, with Judge McNaughton saying that \"he was denied due to the risk [that] Mr. Dotcom would flee jurisdiction and the possibility that if he reached Germany he wouldn't be extradited to face the charges\". On 3 February 2012, an appeal to the High Court of New Zealand upheld the decision to deny bail.\n\nOn 22 February 2012, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned the previous rulings and granted bail to Kim Dotcom, saying that the risk of flight had diminished after his assets had been seized.\n\nOn 5 March 2012, a formal request for the extradition to the United States of Kim Dotcom and three other senior Megaupload staff was filed in a New Zealand court.\n\nOn 30 April 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that around $750,000 of Kim Dotcom's assets could be returned, including a Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG and Toyota Vellfire that had been seized during the raid on his home. The assets in 63 bank accounts and around thirty other vehicles remained in custody. A paperwork error by the New Zealand authorities meant that Kim Dotcom's property had been seized in January 2012 without giving proper notice. The restraining order on his property was granted in April 2012. During April 2012, US district court judge Liam O'Grady stated \"I frankly don't know that we are ever going to have a trial in this matter,\" as he found out that the company had never been formally served with criminal papers by the US.\n\nOn 28 June 2012, New Zealand High Court judge Justice Helen Winkelmann ruled that the search warrants used to raid the home of Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying \"The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid.\"\n\nOn 10 July 2012, a decision on whether Kim Dotcom and other Megaupload employees should be extradited to the United States was delayed until March 2013, in order to allow further time for legal arguments to be heard. In December 2012, it was delayed until August 2013.\n\nIn March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December, 2012.\n\nOn 19 February 2014, a New Zealand appeals court overruled the 28 June 2012 decision, declaring the search warrants against Kim Dotcom to be valid. Dotcom's extradition hearing was set for July 2014.\n\nOn 8 September 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that the New Zealand Police is to return seized electronic devices unencrypted back to Dotcom and those involved.\n\nThe indictment alleged that Megaupload differed from other online file storage businesses.\n\nMedia reports covering the case highlighted a number of points from the indictment used to support claims of illegal activity. The indictment provided a number of instances alleged to show criminal behaviour, as well as indicating design points of Megaupload's operating model as being evidence of criminal intent:\n\n\nSchmitz hired the services of Ira Rothken, an attorney who defended several copyright infringement cases. Rothken claims that the raid was unjustly swift and did not give his client the opportunity to defend himself, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of a completely different turnout.\n\nLegal commentators point out that while the indictment may be correct and Megaupload might have acted as a criminal conspiracy as claimed, a number of points in the indictment are based upon selective interpretations and legal concepts (described in one article as \"novel theories\" of the law) and could be challenged in court. An L.A. Times analysis stated that the author was \"struck by how far the indictment goes to find something nefarious\"; likewise a TechDirt analysis concluded that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of \"flaunting the law\", evidence has potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could \"come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services\". Both analyses concur that other evidence could show criminality; the concerns were not irrefutable. The legal concerns included:\n\nThe US Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides safe harbor for sites that promptly take down infringing content. Safe harbor does not exist if the site has actual knowledge and does nothing about it.\n\nIn Megaupload's case, the indictment alleges DMCA provisions were used for the appearance of legitimacy – the actual material was not removed, only some links to it were, takedowns agreement was approved based on business growth rather than infringement, and the parties themselves openly discussed their infringing activities. The indictment claims that Megaupload executives:\n\n... are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or alternatively know facts or circumstances that would make infringing material apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity where the provider can control that activity; and have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright infringing material from servers they control.\n\nProsecutors claimed in the indictment that Megaupload was not DMCA compliant, and cited the example of an alleged infringer on the site known as \"VV.\" Over six years, VV had allegedly uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, resulting in more than 334 million views. According to prosecutors, although numerous takedown e-mails had been sent, none of the files had been deleted.\n\nIn a television interview with 3 News, Kim Dotcom denied being a \"piracy king\", and claimed that Megaupload had applied the provisions of the DMCA and went beyond it, by giving copyright holders direct rights to delete links. He also claimed that the indictment relied on a malicious interpretation of technical issues to construe its claim of criminal intent, and that there was significant legal use of Megaupload.\n\nKim Dotcom denied the charges filed against him, and retained the services of Ira P. Rothken, an attorney who has defended several copyright infringement cases. Ira Rothken stated that there is no criminal liability for secondary copyright infringement under US law, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of similar accusations which were dealt with as a civil case.\n\nDotcom initially hired Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Bennett, who had confirmed that he was going to represent Megaupload in the piracy case. On 22 January 2012, Bennett withdrew from the case due to a conflict of interest with another client. As of 23 January, barrister Paul Davison QC was quoted as representing Megaupload's founder, Kim Dotcom, in New Zealand. At the end of April 2012, a controversy emerged over legal representation. The law firm Quinn Emanuel, retained by Megaupload to argue for the retention of Megaupload's data, claimed in a motion filed to the court that there was a concerted effort by the United States Department of Justice to deny Megaupload fair legal representation. In the brief, Quinn Emanuel alleged that several law firms had dropped out of the case after the DoJ wrote to them over potential conflicts of interest, arguing that they wanted to call clients of the firms as witnesses. Given the size of the Megaupload, Quinn Emanuel claimed that this \"conflict of interest\" argument could be applied to any law firm with experience in intellectual property rights, denying Megaupload experienced representation in a case where both law and technical issues are involved. Quinn Emanuel received such a letter but rejected the DoJ's arguments.\n\nTechdirt argued that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of \"flouting the law\", evidence had potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could \"come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services\". Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, described the Megaupload case as \"a depressing display of abuse of government authority\". He pointed out that criminal copyright infringement requires that willful infringement has taken place, and that taking Megaupload offline had produced the \"deeply unconstitutional effect\" of denying legitimate users of the site access to their data. Other legal commentators have disagreed with Goldman's assessment of the copyright charges, concluding that the allegations in the indictment, if proven, would support a guilty finding on charges of aiding and abetting copyright infringement. Professor James Grimmelmann, for example, commented, \"If proven at trial, there's easily enough in the indictment to prove criminal copyright infringement many times over.\"\n\nThe defense has drawn on procedural errors by the prosecution to challenge the case. In a judgement in the end of May, NZ Judge David Harvey granted the defendants the right to the disclosure of evidence against them held by the FBI in preparation for the extradition trial. In his 81-page decision, he came to the assessment that the DoJ is attempting to use concepts of civil law, in particular secondary copyright infringement, in a criminal case, which creates legal issues. He also confirmed that the charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement. In a separate development in the United States, the defense has challenged the case against Megaupload as a whole, claiming that the US has no jurisdiction over a foreign company and that the seizure of Megaupload's assets was unlawful. A second brief points out numerous legal errors in the indictment, declaring it \"an experiment in stretching U.S. criminal law well past the breaking point.\"\n\nFollowing the seizure of Megaupload, concerns were raised as to what would happen to the files that had been uploaded by its users. On 20 January 2012, the Justice Department stated that \"It is important to note that Mega clearly warned users to keep copies of any files they uploaded\" adding that \"Megaupload.com expressly informed users through its Frequently Asked Questions ('FAQs') and its Terms of Service that users have no proprietary interest in any of the files on Megaupload's servers, they assume the full risk of complete loss or unavailability of their data, and that Megaupload can terminate site operations without prior notice.\" On 27 January 2012, U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride wrote:\n\nThe Mega Servers are not in the actual or constructive custody or control of the United States, but remain at the premises controlled by, and currently under the control of, Carpathia and Cogent. Should the defendants wish to obtain independent access to the Mega Servers, or coordinate third-party access to data housed on Mega Servers, the issue must be resolved directly with Cogent or Carpathia.\n\nIn response, on 30 January 2012, Carpathia Hosting denied having access to MegaUpload files and issued a press release stating\n\nCarpathia Hosting does not have, and has never had, access to the content on MegaUpload servers and has no mechanism for returning any content residing on such servers to MegaUpload's customers. The reference to the 2 February 2012 date in the Department of Justice letter for the deletion of content is not based on any information provided by Carpathia to the U.S. Government. We would recommend that anyone who believes that they have content on MegaUpload servers contact MegaUpload. Please do not contact Carpathia Hosting.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has started a campaign to allow legitimate users of Megaupload in the US access to their data and wants the data preserved for that reason. It has chosen to represent one such legitimate user in court and thus has sided with Megaupload and Carpathia in asking the court to retain the data.\n\nOn 26 April 2012, Megaupload data negotiations began. Carpathia reported that maintaining the data costs over 9,000 USD a day, and wanted to seek a formal resolution on whether to delete the data or release it to interested parties. United States district court Judge Liam O'Grady ordered all parties to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that 35 million USD had been paid by Megaupload to Carpathia, and alleged that Carpathia had knowingly profited from copyright infringement.\n\nFollowing the shutdown of the Megaupload website, the website of the United States Department of Justice and a number of other websites were taken offline following concerted denial of service attacks attributed to Anonymous.\n\nGizmodo concurred that it was \"almost certainly the result of a quickly assembled DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attack—and easily the widest in scope and ferocity we've seen in some time\", commenting that \"if you had any doubts Anonymous is still a hacker wrecking ball, doubt no more\". Links posted in chatrooms and on Twitter, when clicked on by unsuspecting Internet users, ran a web version of the application known as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon.\nOn 19 January 2012, Anonymous released a statement on Pastebin.com accepting responsibility of the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA, MPAA, BMI, FBI, and others. According to the Russian state-run RT network, Anonymous described the attacks as \"the single largest Internet attack in its history\".\n\nFormer French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was satisfied with the shutdown of the website. He found the site's operators were reaping \"criminal profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works\". \"The time has come for increased judicial and police co-operation between states\" in the fight against online piracy, he said in a statement.\n\nWeb organisations have raised concerns about possible effects of the Megaupload case on the future of file sharing, cloud storage, and Internet commerce. Various commentators including John C. Dvorak, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Sanchez have written on the topic as well, particularly as it relates US government powers to take down a web site without a trial, even without new laws like SOPA. In fact, the U.S. Dept of Justice was able to rely on PRO-IP, a law passed back in 2008, in order to shut down Megaupload.\n\nPeople who used Megaupload for personal and business storage, such as large audio and video files for family and work, have also voiced their complaints about the fact that they no longer had access to their files on the service. Examples cited in the media included staff at public interest group \"Public Knowledge\" who used it for large files, and Android cellphone software writers who described it as \"one of the best ways to distribute [software] ... There are a number of similar sites for this use, but Megaupload was always the fastest\".\n\nIn response to the shutdown, a number of other file hosting websites changed the functionality of their services. FileSonic.com, one of the top ten file hosting services, withdrew the ability to share links to files. The site's main page added a banner stating \"All sharing functionality on FileSonic is now disabled. Our service can only be used to upload and retrieve files that you have uploaded personally.\" Other file hosting websites followed suit, including FileServe.com, FileJungle.com, Uploadstation.com, x7.to and 4shared.com, by shutting down, cancelling affiliate programs or allowing users to only download what they themselves uploaded. Another large file-sharing website, Uploaded.to, ceased services for users accessing from United States-based IP addresses. BTJunkie, a website indexing torrent files, shut down voluntarily on 6 February 2012. The file hosting site Turbobit.net blocked access to U.S. visitors, and QuickSilverScreen, a site offering streaming video links, closed on 7 February 2012.\n\nHowever, other file hosting companies felt no need to change, with MediaFire's CEO Derek Labian saying that he and his file hosting company are not concerned by the Megaupload incident because \"Megaupload was making a ridiculous amount of money with a ridiculously bad service... We don't have a business built on copyright infringement.\" A spokesperson for RapidShare similarly expressed a lack of concern, saying that \"file hosting itself is a legitimate business\", pointing out that Microsoft's OneDrive operates on a similar basis.\n"}

He had six brothers and sisters. He married his first wife, Chana Sara Shapiro, before the start of World War II.\n\nIn 1944, he was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, arriving there three days before Shavuot. While in Auschwitz, he was experimented upon by Josef Mengele. Because of \"chemical burning experiments\", he is unable to grow facial hair; he is also unable to have children. He was transferred from Auschwitz to the Warsaw Ghetto and the Breslau concentration camp, and later to Bergen-Belsen. Six months after the war ended, he reunited with his wife in Sweden. In 1947 they immigrated to the United States and settled in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nHe and his wife immigrated to Israel in 1962. The following year he founded Kiryas Kaliv in Rishon LeZion. The foundation stone was laid on 7 Adar 5723 (3 March 1963), the day of the yahrtzeit of the founder of the dynasty, Grand Rabbi Yitzchak Isak Taub. Several years later he moved his headquarters to Bnei Brak. In 2004, the rebbe's court moved to Jerusalem.\n\nSince World War II, the Rebbe has actively spoken about the Holocaust and frequently invokes the memory of the Jewish martyrs. He has encouraged the recital of \"Shema Yisrael\" to memorialize Holocaust victims at the conclusion of religious events in Israel. He has also traveled to interact with millions of Jews by telling his story and encouraging the saying of \"Shema Yisrael\". He is also active in Jewish outreach and conducts regular lectures for groups of professionals, including doctors and police officers. In addition, a network of kollels, an encyclopedia project, and several other divisions of Kaliv have been founded.\n\nIn March 2014 he participated in the annual conference of the Rabbinical Congress of Europe, which met in Budapest to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the destruction of Hungarian Jewry. He delivered an emotion-laden speech in Hebrew, and switched to English to direct remarks to US President Barack Obama and Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nTaub's first wife, Chana Sara, died in 2010.

From Woolwich he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers on 6 June 1918 and after passing through the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, he was posted to the First Field Squadron RE in the Rhine Army.\n\nIn 1920 he went to India and served with the Queen's Own Madras Sappers and Miners in the Third Field Troop at Sialkot. In 1922 he went into the Works Services in India as garrison engineer at Kohat and then at Khaisora which is today in Pakistan. He saw active service in the Waziristan Campaign where his main responsibility was the construction of roads. On 12 June 1923 he was awarded the Military Cross, the citation read:\n\nHe then returned to Chatham and went to Cambridge University.\n\nIn 1925 he returned to India and was placed on special duty at Kabul in the foreign and political department. In 1926 he returned to Nowshera as garrison engineer and spent several years in Works Services at Peshawar where he made full use of this engineering genius designing bridges. Also in 1925, he married Ruth Carolyne, daughter of G. E. Wakefield. They had three sons, two of whom went on to serve in the Royal Engineers. On 1 June 1929, Jefferis was promoted to captain.\n\nIn 1934 he was posted to the Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners at Kirkee as a company commander in the training battalion. He returned to Britain in 1936 and joined the Twenty-third Field Company at Aldershot. Moving to the First Field Squadron, he stayed at Aldershot while the unit was being mechanised. While at Aldershot, Jefferis successfully raced horses and played squash competitively. He was promoted major on 6 June 1938, and on 4 April 1939 he was appointed a General Staff Officer, Grade 2.\n\nIn 1940, Jefferis was sent to Norway, he returned to give a personal account of his activities to Prime Minister Winston Churchill who used his report to brief the War Cabinet:\n\nJefferis started working on sabotage devices for the \"Military Intelligence Research\" (MIR). When MIR was combined with other \"hush-hush\" elements to form the SOE, Jefferis' unit was not included and it instead became a department in the Ministry of Defence; the only unit of the Minister of Defence (The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill) and was known as \"MD1\", ultimately based in a house called \"The Firs\" in Whitchurch near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire England.\n\nThe unit was responsible for the design, development and production of a number of unique special forces and regular munitions during the Second World War. It gained the nickname \"Winston Churchill's toyshop\".\n\nJefferis was an explosives expert and engineer, but lacked the ability to manage men well. He was assisted in the management of MD1 by a wily assistant – Major Stuart Macrae, whose book \"Winston Churchill's Toyshop\", is still one of the few published works on this unique unit.\n\nOver the period of the Second World War, MD1 was responsible for the introduction into service of a total of 26 different devices.\n\nTheir designs include the PIAT, the Sticky bomb and one of the first magnetic Limpet naval mines.\n\nThrough the application of the Squash head and HEAT technology they had a role in the development and production of Lt-Col Stewart Blacker's Blacker Bombard, the PIAT (Blacker's smaller version of the bombard matched to a hollow charge warhead, Hedgehog (effectively an adaption of the Bombard spigot mortar principle working with the Navy's Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development) and tank variants including the AVRE with its \"Flying Dustbin\" 290mm Petard spigot mortar, and a bridge-laying tank.\n\nJefferis developed the idea of the squash head further. His most ambitious project was a bomb designed to sink capital ships, his ideas were put forward by himself and Lord Cherwell in 1944 and coincided with the Admiralty's interest in developing a homing bomb for use against the Japanese. The development of this weapon was supported by the Air Staff and MAP who allocated it a higher priority that any other anti-capital ship weapon. When the war ended, development of the 'Cherwell-Jefferis' bomb was continued under the code names \"Journey's End\" and \"Blue Boar\".\n\nPrime Minister Churchill became acquainted with then Major Jefferis in 1940 and regarded him as a \"singularly capable and forceful man.\" He recommended a promotion to lieutenant colonel so that Jefferis would have more authority. Jefferis received substantive promotion to this rank on 10 February 1944.\n\nJefferis was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Churchill in the 1945 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours, having previously been appointed a Commander of the Order (CBE). He was promoted to acting major general on 15 May 1945, and substantive colonel on 14 July 1945. He left the Ministry of Supply on 20 November 1945, reverting to the temporary rank of brigadier.\n\nIn 1945 Jefferis became deputy Engineer-in-Chief in India and 1947 he became Engineer-in-Chief in Pakistan, holding the temporary rank of major general. He was promoted to substantive brigadier on 1 November 1947, and returned to England on 2 January 1950 to become Chief Superintendent of the Military Engineering Experimental Establishment, reverting to the rank of brigadier on 8 March 1950. He was made ADC to the King on 24 May 1951 and held that appointment until he retired on 18 August 1953, on his retirement he was granted the honorary rank of major-general. As an ADC, Jefferis took part in King George VI's funeral, and Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Procession He died on 5 September 1963.\n\nJefferis had a passion for ocean racing. In 1938, he built a 7-ton yacht at Aldershot called \"Prelude\" with another Royal Engineer officer and they sailed successfully both before and after the war.\n\n\n"}

In later life she became fascinated by astrology and the \"charismatic appeal\" of Adolf Hitler. She founded the Adolf Hitler Fan Club in order to test the limits of free speech and to provoke a reaction, which it did when the police raided her home.\n\nSmith was born in Kenya on 5 September 1933. Her father was a telecommunications engineer. The family lived in Uganda and Egypt before arriving in the United Kingdom in 1945. Smith was educated at a convent school in St. Albans which she left at the age of 16 against the wishes of her mother. She worked as a florist, a window dresser and for the BBC as a secretary.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1966 she took evening classes at Saint Martin's School of Art where she was taught by Anthony Caro and Elizabeth Frink. She took classes at the Chelsea School of Art in 1966–67 under Jeremy Moon, Robyn Denny and Anthony Hill. She spent two years as a school teacher from 1970 but left due to disillusionment about British teaching conditions.\n\nSmith's first solo exhibition was in 1969 and her photographs and paintings were also shown in London and New York. In the early 1970s she began to create mail art after she met Opal L. Nations and was invited to join the Global Infantilism group. She knew Anna Banana, founder of \"Vile\" magazine, and Bill Gaglione.\n\nHer work had a strong anti-establishment theme and her regular despatches included \"Lost Marbles Dump\", which commented on property developers in Chelsea, and \"A Present From Belfast\" about the conflict in Northern Ireland. In 1974 she founded the Adolf Hitler Fan Club, of which she was probably the only member, and around the same time created an Adolf Hitler Memorial Fund collecting tin, in order to test the limits of free speech, provoke a reaction, and make an ironic and satirical comment on life in pre-Thatcher Britain. In 1977 she issued mail art signed \"H Himmler\". Postal emissions relating to the Hitler fan club resulted in a police raid on her home.\n\nIn 1983, she explained in her \"c.v.\":\n\nThe ADOLF HITLER FAN CLUB was intended to be an analogy for the week-kneed [\"sic\"] British Governments since 1945 and was stimulated by local Chelsea politics regarding landlords/tenants/development/tourism, in which I was interested in the early seventies. Of course, this was not the only factor involved but it was the most pressing. The country is a mess and nothing gets any better. What I feel about the current situation will take several years more to express through my art. For the immediate present I am preoccupied with Adolf Hitler's involvement in the occult, the mediumistic nature of his public speaking and the mystery of his charismatic appeal to the multitudes ... Adolf Hitler remained the subject of my painting as he had been of my Mailart and I continue to paint about him because everything that has happened in this country since his death has been a reaction against him. He is the biggest influence on this country this century.\nIn 2006 she distributed \"Tombs of the Last (Species)\" to all members of Parliament followed by \"SPECIES TOMBS\" circulated to all MPs in 2008. In 2013 she produced \"Sun and Moon\" as a commentary on military action in the Middle East which featured a Sun and Moon, a carousel horse, and a tank against a split background with an Arabic language newspaper in the top half and a deconstructed American flag below.\n\nShe used antique black and white cameras to produce her mailart which she replaced with a modern colour camera in 1998, and colour photography became her main medium for a time, taking pictures that she said were \"inspired by ancient monuments, cultures, myths and flint simulacra gathered on Brighton beach which also could have interested our ancient ancestors.\" \"Extinctions\" was a series of 14 colour Xerox prints of inscribed photographs inspired by her interest in nature and animal forces. She created oil paintings from Second World War photographs and carved some ivory figures in order to undermine demand for the material.\n\nAstrology played an important part in her life and her art from the early 1980s. She was greatly affected by Richard Houck's book \"The Astrology of Death\" (1994) and later produced astrological charts analysing the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 and the 2007 financial crisis.\n\nShe was often in ill-health and in 1990 was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) after having suffered periods of illness since the 1960s. Those who knew her described her as deeply reserved. She never married.\n\nSmith died after a long illness on 19 March 2017. The Tate Gallery has around 30 boxes of her art and correspondence including her Adolf Hitler Memorial Fund collecting tin.\n\n\n"}

Other combinations, however, are sometimes found.\n\nIn jazz music, a quintet is group of five players, usually consisting of two of any of the following instruments, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, flute or trombone in addition to traditional jazz trio – piano, double bass, drums.\n\nIn some modern bands there are quintets formed from the same family of instruments with various voices, as an all-brass ensemble, or all saxophones, in soprano, alto, baritone, and bass, and sometimes double bass.\n\nMany rock, pop, and metal bands are made up of five people, normally consisting of two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, and a lead vocalist. This is normally considered to the maximum size of most bands. However, several bands like Linkin Park, Slipknot, Guns N' Roses, and DragonForce have more than 5 band members. Having more than five members is mostly uncommon in rock and pop music.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common in a cappella and barbershop music circles to use the fifth voice as vocal percussionist, with the remainder being a traditional SATB (soprano alto tenor bass) quartet, or perhaps SSAA or TTBB.\n\n\n\n"}

Woodson\n\nRuby Garrard Woodson (June 22, 1931 – February 8, 2008) was an educator and chemistry teacher, the founder of the \"Cromwell Academy\" in Washington, D. C., and the founder of the \"Florida Academy of African American Culture\" in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nShe was born in Houston County, Alabama, but raised in Sarasota. Her mother, Ella Mae Garrard (later, Singleton) worked as a maid and later owned a small country store. Her father, David Garrard, was a farmer, and later a circus roustabout. She had one child, William G. Woodson.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, she was the valedictorian of her class of 1947 when she was graduated from Booker High School in Sarasota.\n\nAt the age of nineteen, in June 1951 Woodson was awarded her bachelor of science degree in chemistry from Florida A & M University in Tallahassee, Florida. She received her master of arts degree in education from American University in Washington, D.C. in 1960. Her masters thesis was entitled, \"Some Effects of the Atomic Era on the Teaching of High School Chemistry in the United States\".\n\nIn 1957, while she was on a vacation in her hometown of Sarasota and researching materials for completion of her master's degree, Ruby Woodson was refused entry to the public library in Sarasota. She made a formal objection to her treatment that she took to city and county government officials. Her efforts led to the elimination of racial barriers to community services paid for by the taxation of all residents. Soon the vestiges of segregation began to fall in Sarasota and all residents were granted access to the library.\n\nShe spent thirteen years teaching chemistry and physics in the Washington, D.C. public school system before founding \"Cromwell Academy\", a private secondary school to serve gifted minority students in the district. The academy was founded in 1973 in a church annex and soon was sending many of its students to classes at Georgetown University and Howard University for credits toward their secondary diplomas. The inspiration for the name of the academy was Otelia Cromwell, an educator who was the first black woman awarded a Ph.D. by Yale University. A reputation developed quickly by the academy for its academic achievements, attracting the enrollment of their children by prominent people as well as the gifted and aspiring members of disadvantaged groups whose teachers advised application to the academy. Bill Cosby sent his son, Ennis, and the president of Venezuela sent his daughter.\n\nWoodson was a pivotal figure in the day-to-day administration of the academy and fulfilled many other roles such as college placement adviser, guidance counselor, as well as instructor. Initial difficulties encountered in operating expenses often were resolved by donations from Woodson's personal savings.\n\nThe student body of the academy was small and familial. Often, instruction in life skills also fell to Woodson, who helped the students with financing as well as handling personal issues and later, negotiating such things as the purchase of automobiles and houses. Donations were sought to develop a scholarship program to assist many of the students. Woodson had overcome dyslexia in her efforts to excel and was able to provide special insights to children coping with similar hurdles. She inspired the students with her own high standards of ethics and morality and helped them develop personal discipline and self-respect. She taught them how to make applications to colleges appropriate to their interests and abilities and to apply for scholarships.\n\nThe students from the academy gained entrance to the best academic institutions in the country and soon Woodson’s students were awarded baccalaureate and advanced degrees form Columbia University, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Yale University, and Vassar College. The academy became recognized for academic excellence.\n\nOne 1979 graduate of the academy, Lisa S. Martin, later was graduated from Yale University and Emory University and is a practicing psychologist in Maryland. She attests to the power Woodson had to inspire her students, making them feel able to meet any type of academic challenge and motivating them to win acceptance at the institutions of their choice, be it Ivy League, the big ten, or top southern colleges. Woodson's achievements were lauded in the Washington Post and by the United States Department of Education.\n\nIn 1989 Ruby Woodson retired to Sarasota, but immersed herself in the affairs of the community. She participated in many cultural and civic activities, from the Asolo Center for the Performing Arts and Habitat for Humanity to the United Way as well as in local and regional long-range planning charrettes. She ultimately was moved to found the Florida Academy for African-American Culture (FAAC), an institution dedicated to educational advancement and cultural preservation with a special emphasis on children from pre-school through high school.\n\nShe was appointed to the county library advisory board and was among those who brought a branch of the library to the Newtown neighborhood, the section of the city where she had been raised, so a library would be within walking distance for the children of that area. The United Way named Ruby Woodson among the twelve \"Women of Community Impact\" in Sarasota County.\n\nAfter her return to Sarasota, Woodson founded another educational institution in that community, the \"Florida Academy for African American Culture\".\n\nThe historic home of a prominent black family, the \"Pearl and Grover Koons House\", was purchased, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and developed as a museum with a library, the African-American Culture Research Center and Library, to enhance the educational opportunities of the children of the community. It had classrooms for gifted pre-school and school-age students in an adjacent building.\n\nThe academy sponsored oratory and essay contests, awarding prizes to students participating in its Black History events. Its library donated books to local students, churches, and day-care centers. Every Saturday free books were given to interested children coming to the academy.\n\nAn avid reader from her youth, Ruby Woodson emphasized the importance of developing reading skills in children and encouraging them to read about all things that interest them. She credited her father and Ethel Reid Hays, her first teacher, for encouraging her interest in reading.\n\nThe quote above is from a biography of Ruby Woodson assembled and kept on file by the Family Heritage House Museum in Manatee County, Florida; the museum is on the campus of the State College of Florida (formerly Manatee Community College).

When Thorson was 18, Liberace hired him to act as his personal friend and companion, a position that allegedly included a five-year romantic relationship with lavish gifts, travel, and Liberace's promises that he would adopt and care for Thorson. Liberace claimed that he had \"more mink coats and diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor\". Liberace also incorporated Thorson into his Las Vegas stage performances – for example, Thorson drove Liberace's Rolls-Royce onstage, and was a dancer. \n\nAccording to Thorson, their committed relationship ended because of Liberace's promiscuous behavior and Thorson's drug addiction. Thorson also claimed that it was Liberace that originally started him on the drugs, but then when his habit got out of control, Liberace cut him off from all of his credit cards. Thorson stated that following his plastic surgery, the surgeon provided for him a cocktail of highly addictive drugs that included cocaine, Quaaludes, biphetamines, and Demerol. Thorson stated that since he was so young at the time of meeting Liberace, he would do anything that he could to please him, including getting plastic surgery so that he could resemble him, but he felt that their relationship was one-sided. He called Liberace both generous and possessive.\n\nIn 2000, Thorson was among several people featured in the British television documentary \"Liberace: Too Much of a Good Thing Is Wonderful\". In 2002, Thorson was interviewed by Larry King on \"Larry King Live\", during which Thorson confirmed that, in the midst of his relationship with Liberace, he chose to have plastic surgery to look more like Liberace at the pianist's suggestion. Also during the interview with King, Thorson revealed his chin implant had been removed earlier in 2002.\n\nFollowing his release from prison in 2012, Thorson gave interviews about his relationship with Liberace, one with Howard Stern, in June 2013, in which he talked about former lovers and affairs he had when he lived with Liberace. Another interview was on \"Entertainment Tonight\" in May 2012, where he stated that memories of his time with Liberace were still difficult for him.\n\nIn 1982, after he was let go by Liberace, Thorson filed a $113 million lawsuit against Liberace, part of which was a palimony suit. This was the first same-sex palimony case filed in U.S. history. Thorson decided to sue because he claimed that Liberace threw him out on the streets with nothing. Liberace continued to deny that he was homosexual, and during court depositions in 1984, he insisted that Thorson was never his lover. Throughout their lawsuit, Thorson stated that Liberace referred to him in the media as a disgruntled employee, a liar, a gold digger, and claimed that there was never a sexual relationship between them. \n\nThe case was settled out of court in 1986, with Thorson receiving a $75,000 cash settlement, plus three cars and three pet dogs worth another $20,000. Thorson visited and reconciled with Liberace shortly before the entertainer's death in February 1987. Thorson said, after Liberace had died, that he settled because he knew that Liberace was dying, and that Thorson had intended to sue based on conversion of property rather than palimony.\n\nA year after Liberace's death, Thorson published a book about their relationship, \".\" \n\nIn the Canada–US television film \"\" (1988), Thorson was portrayed by Michael Dolan.\n\nThorson's book was later adapted by Richard LaGravenese and Steven Soderbergh into the 2013 film \"Behind the Candelabra\", in which Thorson was played by Matt Damon opposite Michael Douglas as Liberace. The movie aired on HBO on May 26, 2013. The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Richard LaGravenese, with music by Academy Award-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch.\n\nIn 1989, Thorson emerged as a pivotal witness in the prosecution of gangster Eddie Nash, in the 1981 quadruple murders of the Wonderland Gang. For his testimony, he was placed in the federal witness protection program. In 1990, he was shot five times when drug dealers broke into his hotel room in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nIn 2008, Thorson pleaded guilty to felony drug and burglary charges and was sentenced to four years in prison. \n\nPreviously diagnosed with hepatitis C, in the autumn of 2012 Thorson was diagnosed with stage II cancer. Since his diagnosis, Thorson has made public pleas for money to continue his medical treatments. Thorson had planned in 2012 to re-release the book \"Behind the Candelabra\" to coincide with the film's release.\n\nIn February 2013, police investigating a lost wallet tracked the use of the victim's credit cards to a hotel in Reno, Nevada. Thorson was found to be using the credit cards and was arrested. Thorson (who also uses the alias Jess Marlow, an alias he says that he acquired when he entered the protection program in the Nash case) was booked on a variety of charges, including burglary and using a credit card without consent. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years' probation in July 2013.\n\nThorson did not do well on probation. In September 2013, he tested positive for methamphetamine, but was given another chance. He subsequently failed drug tests again — twice in October, and again on November 1, 2013. He was arrested on November 19, 2013, after violating a court order to enter an inpatient treatment facility in Reno two weeks earlier. On January 23, 2014, his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to 8 to 20 years in Nevada prison. Thorson is currently incarcerated in Northern Nevada Correctional Center in Carson City. \n\nDennis Hof, owner of several legal Nevada brothels and the one who bailed Thorson out of jail during some of his 2013 legal problems, had said that this long prison sentence, because of Thorson's cancer, is a \"virtual death sentence.\"\n\n"}

Her approach to the study of race, gender, class, nationality, transnationality, and ethnicity is informed by Marxist feminist dialectical, and historical materialism approach. She is critical of theoretical frameworks which treat race, gender, and class atomistically, and reduce them to the domains of discourse, text, language, or identity. She critiques monopolies of knowledge and power in education, and advocates dialogical and inclusive pedagogical practices. Mojab's research has been published on Islamic feminism, minority women in academe, diversity and academic freedom in Canadian and Iranian universities, adult education and civil society in the Middle East, feminism and nationalism, state-university relation, and women's access to higher education.\n\nHer publications include, among others, articles and book chapters which have appeared in periodicals such as \"International Journal of Lifelong long Education\"; \"Feminist Review\"; \"Canadian Woman Studies Journal\"; \"Journal of Middle East Women's Studies\"; \"Journal of Ethnicities\"; \"Resources for Feminist Research\"; \"The Canadian Journal for the Study of Adult Education\"; \"Adult Education Quarterly: A Journal of Research and Theory; Studies in Continuing Education\"; \"Al-Raida Magazine\" (Institute for Women’s Studies in the Arab World); \"Pakistan Journal of Women’s Studies: Alam-e-Niswan\"; \"Journal of Race, Gender, and Class\"; and \"Atlantis: A Women’s Studies Journal\".
