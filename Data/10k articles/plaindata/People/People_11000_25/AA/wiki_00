Known for his command capabilities and popular among his subordinates, Abu Jandal was called \"The Lion\" among ISIL fighters and fought in several battles in Syria and Iraq. By late 2016, Abu Jandal had become ISIL's second highest-ranking commander in Syria and led the defense of its \"de facto\" capital Raqqa against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). He was killed by a US airstrike on 26 December 2016.\n\nGenerally, relatively little is known about Abu Jandal. His birth name has been reported as either \"Abdul Mohsen al-Zaghilani al-Taresh\" or \"Abdul Mohsen Al-Dhufairi\". He was born in the city of al Jahra in Kuwait, likely during the 1970s or 1980s, and was at some point influenced and radicalised by Jihadist ideology. As result, he ventured to Syria, where he joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Over time, he began to play an important role in recruiting new members for ISIL through social media, appearing in propaganda videos and carrying out executions. He was even appointed to a senior position on the ISIL Media Council. In this way, he won considerable fame and many fans and followers in his home city Al Jahra.\n\nSometime after joining ISIL, he married the Syrian Jihadist Rahaf Zina, though other reports stated that his wife was Iraqi. The couple eventually had a son, Jandal, whereupon he adopted his kunya \"Abu Jandal al-Kuwaiti\" (\"Father of Jandal, the Kuwaiti\") as \"nom de guerre\". He also rose in ranks as military commander, while becoming popular among subordinate ISIL fighters due to his reported modesty. By July 2014, Abu Jandal served as a top commander of the Islamic State's 6,000-man-strong Army of Hasakah, personally leading the Knights Battalion. Over time, he became a \"troubleshooter\" for ISIL, and the battalion under his command subsequently became known the \"Rapid Response Battalion\". In August 2014, Abu Jandal helped to brutally suppress the Al-Shaitat tribal rebellion, and around September of that year, he fought in Deir ez-Zor.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2016, Abu Jandal led various military operations in both Iraq as well as Syria, and joined ISIL’s War Committee. In this capacity, he was involved in the planning and operation of suicide car bombs, IEDs, and chemical weapons against the SDF, and became closely associated with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as well as ISIL's terror attack planners.\n\nBy December 2016, Abu Jandal had risen to the second-most important ISIL commander in Syria, and participated in an offensive to retake Palmyra and its surroundings from the Syrian government. After this attack's success on 11 December, he was redeployed to Raqqa and appointed as chief commander for the defenses of the Islamic State's \"de facto\" capital in face of the SDF-led Raqqa campaign. His most important task was protecting ISIL's supply routes to the northern frontlines and al-Bab in the west. Abu Jandal consequently became crucially involved in the battle for the strategic significant village of Jabar. ISIL troops who were probably under his command achieved a minor success during this battle when they surrounded and destroyed a SDF detachment in the village on 21 December, forcing the international SDF volunteer Ryan Lock to kill himself in order to not be captured. Nevertheless, Jabar finally fell to the SDF on 26 December, whereupon Abu Jandal personally organized and led a large-scale counter-attack. In course of this assault, a US airstrike hit his convoy near the village, killing him and his bodyguards; the counter-attack subsequently failed. Abu Jandal was in his thirties when he died.\n\nAccording to CJTF–OIR, Abu Jandal's death was a heavy blow to ISIL, degrading \"ISIL's ability to defend Raqqa and launch external operations against the West.\" ISIL confirmed his death on 27 December and eulogized him in a video titled \"Smashing the Enemies: Regarding the Results of the Army of the Islamic State Against the Apostate PKK on the Outskirts of the Wilayat [al-Raqqa]\".\n\nAfter his death, his widow Rahaf Zina reportedly married Hussein Al-Dhufairi, who is possibly Abu Jandal's brother and another ISIL leader. On March 25 2017, Hussein Al-Dhufairi and Rahaf Zina were arrested by security forces in Manila, Philippines. Soon after, Kuwaiti security officials executed two raids in Kuwait, arresting three additional family members of Abu Jandal, and seven other suspects. Kuwaiti officials said they found bomb-making equipment during the raids.\n"}

She is described in the Quran as the wife of the Pharaoh, who reigned during the time of Moses (\"Musa\"). She is believed to have secretly accepted monotheism after witnessing the miracle of Moses in her husband's court. The tradition holds that Asiya worshipped God in secret and prayed in disguise fearing her husband. She died while being tortured by her husband, who had discovered her monotheism and retaliated to her rebellion against his tyranny.\n\nMuslims believe that Asiya came from a rich family and that she was a very beautiful and generous woman. Her marriage to the Pharaoh was arranged. Unlike her husband, she was humble and accepted the faith that Moses and Aaron were preaching. Although she had exceeding wealth, she was not arrogant like the Pharaoh. She realized that faith was far more important and was thus exalted by God amongst the women of her generation.\n\nAsiya and her maids were at the neighbouring Nile river one day. To their amazement, they found a crate floating in the river. Asiya immediately ordered that the crate be brought out on shore. The maids thought there was a treasure in the crate, but instead found a baby boy, Moses. Asiya instantly felt motherly love towards him. She told the Pharaoh about the baby. The incident has been described in the Quran.\n\nAsiya then offered Moses's mother to live in their household as his wet nurse and paid her for her services, unaware of their relationship.\n\nWhen she witnessed the death of a believing woman under her husband's torture, she declared her faith before Pharaoh who tried to turn her away from the faith, but Asiya refused to reject the God and the teaching of Moses. On the Pharaoh's order, she was tortured to death.\n\nIt is said that Asiya was a sincere believer and that she fully submitted herself to Allah, despite being the wife of Pharaoh. According to Hadith, she will be among the first women to enter Paradise because she accepted Moses's monotheism over Pharaoh's beliefs. The Qur'an mentions Asiya as an example to all Muslims\nAbu Musa Ashaari narrated that once the Islamic prophet, Muhammad stated,\n"}

Coptic people are an ethnoreligious group that form the largest Christian group in Libya, the Coptic Orthodox Church in the country having an estimated 60,000 adherents. The Coptic Church is known to have historical roots in Libya long before the Arabs (and Islam) advanced westward from Egypt into Libya. A part of the community is made up of immigrants from Egypt (see Copts in Egypt).\n\nThe Coptic population is estimated to number 60,000. The Copts are the largest Christian denomination, followed by 40,000 Roman Catholics and a small number of Anglicans. They are present in all three major regions.\n\nHistorically speaking, Christianity spread to the Pentapolis in North Africa from Egypt; Synesius of Cyrene (370-414), bishop of Ptolemais, received his instruction at Alexandria in both the Catechetical School and the Museion, and he entertained a great deal of reverence and affection for Neoplatonist Hypatia, whose classes he had attended. Synesius was consecrated by Theophilus of Alexandria in 410. Since the Council of Nicaea in 325, Cyrenaica had been recognized as an ecclesiastical province of the See of Alexandria, in accordance with the ruling of the Nicaean Fathers. The Pope of Alexandria to this day includes the Pentapolis in his title as an area within his jurisdiction.\n\nThe Coptic congregations in several countries were under the ancient Eparchy of the Western Pentapolis, which was part of the Coptic Orthodox Church for centuries until the 13th century.\n\nIn 1971 Pope Shenouda III reinstated it as part of the Eparchy of Metropolitan Bishop Pachomius, Metropolitan of the Holy Metropolis of Beheira (Thmuis & Hermopolis Parva), (Buto), Mariout (Mareotis), Marsa Matruh (Paraetonium), (Apis), Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Metropolis of Libya: (Livis, Marmarica, Darnis & Tripolitania) & Titular Metropolitan Archbishop of the Great and Ancient Metropolis of Pentapolis: (Cyren), (Appollonia), (Ptolemais), (Berenice) and (Arsinoe).\n\nThis was one among a chain of many restructuring of several eparchies by Pope Shenouda III, while some of them were incorporated into the jurisdiction of others, especially those who were within an uncovered region or which were part of a Metropolis that became extinct, or by dividing large eparchies into smaller more manageable eparchies. This was also a part of the restructuring of the Church as a whole.\n\nThey are currently three Coptic Orthodox Churches in Libya: one in Tripoli, Libya (Saint Mark's), one in Benghazi, Libya (Saint Antonios — two priests), and one in Misrata, Libya (Saint Mary and Saint George).\n\nIn February 2014, seven Coptic Christians were dragged out of their houses in the middle of the night, then executed on a beach, east of Benghazi. A group of Copts were kidnapped on separate occasions in December 2014 and January 2015, then executed by the ISIL. A video of the execution of 21 men, in which threats are made to \"the nation of the cross\", was released to the internet on 15 February 2015.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2624588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2624588", "title": "David Hendrik Chassé", "text": "David Hendrik Chassé\n\nDavid Hendrik, Baron Chassé (Tiel, 18 March 1765 – Breda, 2 May 1849) was a Dutch soldier who fought both for and against Napoleon. He commanded the Third Netherlands Division that intervened at a crucial moment in the Battle of Waterloo. In 1830 he bombarded the city of Antwerp as commander of Antwerp Citadel during the Belgian Revolution.\n\nChassé was the son of Carel Johan Chassé, a scion of an old Huguenot family, who was a major in the army of the Dutch Republic, and of Maria Johanna Helena Schull. He married Johanna Adriana van Nieuwenhoven on 10 November 1786 and divorced her in 1795. His second marriage was to the English widow Elisabeth Irish on 12 April 1796. They had one son. This marriage also ended in divorce in 1816.\n\nChassé entered the Dutch army as a ten-year-old cadet in his father's regiment in 1775. He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1781. He resigned his commission in 1786 because of his sympathy for the Patriot party in their opposition to the autocratic regime of stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange. Instead he became a captain in a Patriot Free Corps, defending Muiden and Weesp against the Prussian invaders that restored William to power in 1787. Because of this role in the revolt he had to go into exile in France, as many other Patriots. Another reason for going abroad was that he had killed a man in a duel.\n\nIn 1788 Chassé received a commission as a first lieutenant in the royal French army. After the revolution of 1789 he took part in the campaigns of the revolutionary French armies as a captain in the \"Légion franche étrangère\" (Free foreign legion). He received a wound in the right upper arm in 1794 that would make writing difficult for the rest of his life. As a lieutenant-colonel he conquered the fortress of Zaltbommel shortly before the fall of the Dutch Republic in January 1795.\n\nChassé now entered the service of the Batavian Republic as commander of a regiment of light infantry. He usually performed garrison duties, but was in 1799 part of the Franco-Dutch army that drove the Anglo-Russian expeditionary force from North Holland. In the early 19th century he commanded regiments that took part in the French campaigns in northern Germany that the Batavian army was compelled to join. He was mentioned in dispatches at the siege of Würzburg in 1810. He was promoted to colonel in 1803 and to major-general in 1806 under the Kingdom of Holland.\n\nKing Louis Bonaparte put him in command of the Dutch brigade (part of the Division-Leval) that his brother Napoleon obliged him to contribute to the French campaign in Spain in 1808. For his exploits in that harsh guerilla war in the battles of Pancorbo (better known by the French as Durango; 1808), Mesas de Ibor (1809), Talavera (1809), Almonacid (1809) and Ocana (1809; where he assumed command of the Division-Leval), King Louis created Chassé baron on 1 July 1810, just one week before Napoleon annexed the Kingdom of Holland to the French Empire. Like many Dutchmen, Chassé resented this annexation, so much so, that he refused to accept the \"diplome\" in which Napoleon elevated him to \"baron de l'Empire\" on 30 June 1811. Nevertheless, he continued serving in the army that now became part of the imperial French army.\n\nHe was now made a \"général de brigade\" in that French army (a demotion), serving in the army corps of Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon in Spain. As such he fought in the Battle of Vitoria and the Battle of Maya, where he saved the French army. For this feat he was made an officer in the Légion d'honneur and nominated by d'Erlon for promotion to lieutenant-general in the imperial army. Napoleon affectionately called him \"général baionette\" for his fierceness and his predilection for bayonet attacks.\n\nIn 1814 Chassé was transferred to the Champagne theatre of war where he joined the Division Boyer as commander of its 2nd Brigade. He fought in the battles of Bar-sur-Aube and Arcis-sur-Aube, where he was wounded. He directed the defense of Sens on 3 April 1814. However, after the fall of Paris and Napoleon's first abdication he had had enough and asked to be released from French service. This was granted with the rank of lieutenant-general on 6 October 1814.\n\nHe now returned to the Netherlands which had become independent again. The sovereign prince William I of the Netherlands was keen to engage the services of such an experienced general, and had no doubts about his loyalty. Chassé was commissioned as a major-general in the new Mobile Netherlands Army on 22 October 1814. He was made commander of the Third Netherlands Division on 25 March 1815 and promoted to lieutenant-general on 21 April.\n\nAt the battle of Waterloo Chassé's third division was part of the First Netherlands Corps under the Prince of Orange in the right-center of the Duke of Wellington's Anglo-Allied army. As Wellington, who had often fought opposite Chassé in Spain, apparently did not quite trust him (there may have been some bad feelings on the part of the British) the third division was placed in reserve behind the right wing.\n\nWhen around 7.30 p.m., in the final part of the battle, Chassé noticed that the fire of the British artillery in front of him slackened. In response he ordered Major Van der Smissen to send the Horse artillery battery 'Krahmer' Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin into the firing line. Due at this moment Napoleon staged his Imperial Guards to attack the center. In preparation for the second counterattack Chassé ordered the Detmers brigade (part of the division) to take position behind Van der Smissen. His counterattack was to be a bayonet charge, as Chassé had a predilection for this type of manoeuvre (that had earned him the nickname of \"général baionette\" from Napoleon). The murderous fire of , battery of Horse-artillery, and the bayonet attack of the Detmers brigade, against the Imperial Guard, broke the attack of that elite unit, and turned it into a rout. Though this was a turning point in the battle, Chassé was not mentioned in dispatches by Wellington, like so many others. He expressed his annoyance at this in a letter to Lord Hill, shortly after the battle, and received a conciliatory reply, recognizing his contribution. For his part in the battle Chassé was made a knight-commander in the Military William Order on 8 July 1815.\n\nAfter Waterloo Chassé was given several high commands. After the beginning of the Belgian Revolution he replaced Prince Frederick of the Netherlands as commander-in-chief of Dutch forces in Belgium on 17 October 1830. The next day he ordered the retreat to the fortified area around Antwerp. As commander of the citadel of Antwerp he ordered the bombardment of that city after an incident, the exact cause of which is still in dispute, on 27 October 1830. Whatever the provocation, the large loss of civilian life this bombardment caused seems hard to justify. The resentment it caused among Antwerp civilians helped lose Antwerp for the Dutch cause.\n\nNevertheless, the citadel remained in Dutch hands, and Chassé its commander. In 1832 (by now a full general) he commanded a garrison of 5,000 Dutch troops that was besieged by a French army under Marshal Gérard ten times that number. Despite this superiority, and the fact that the citadel was bombarded day and night by the French, the garrison held out for twenty-four days, before Chassé was finally forced to surrender. This earned him a knight's-grand cross in the Military William Order by promotion, and the admiration of the French, who made his imprisonment in Saint-Omer as pleasant as feasible. He was released as a prisoner of war in June 1833 and appointed governor of the fortress of Breda that same month.\n\nAfter the peace with Belgium in 1839 Chassé finally retired. He was at first promised his full salary as a general for life, but this was reduced to the usual pension after government economies in 1841. King William I had appointed him a member for life of the First Chamber of the States-General in 1839 (which supplemented his income for a while), but after life memberships of that Senate were abolished by the constitutional reform of 1848 he lost that income also. He therefore had to sell his beloved horses.\n\nChassé died a few months later, aged 84. He was almost alone at his death, because his only son had predeceased him. His relatives declined a state funeral at his wish. He was laid to rest in Ginneken, now part of Breda, in a very simple burial.\n\n\n"}

The crew assembled to record spots for his father's furniture store in Newark, New Jersey, included the voice of Pat Conell, a local DJ on a 'race-music' station (who later became the first black network announcer), and two teenagers who wrote (Don Kirshner) and sang (Bobby Darin) the jingles. Schwartz credits the witnessing of Darin's rise on the music charts as his primary inspiration for a lifetime in music.\n\nAt ten, after his family moved to Houston, Texas in 1962, he switched to drums, then bass at 15. He attended Houston's Memorial High School and was classmates with Vince Bell, and Bill Browder. In 1966, as a fourteen-year-old, Schwartz met vocalist Ray Salazar and began gigging at Old Market Square in downtown Houston, at all-night clubs and dancehalls in Texas and southern Louisiana, and on the east Texas soul circuit.\n\nSchwartz did some of his early basswork behind Sam \"Lightnin'\" Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, BW Stephenson and Blaze Foley.\n\nWhile a featured vocalist with Pete Samson & Roadmap in 1973, Schwartz met recording studio manager Roger Tausz and began his recording career and a lifelong association with Tausz. Using Roadmap as a studio band, Schwartz recorded four songs, including 'Ride That Train', which broke onto local, the regional radio, and 'I Found God At A Truckstop', which was recorded by many, including Pete Samson & Kinky Friedman, but only released by Samson & Schwartz. These small successes gave Schwartz the credibility and momentum on which he built his regional music career.\n\nIn 1976, Schwartz co-founded the band RELAYER, who only released one (RELAYER – 1977) of the three albums they recorded, but, found an underground prog-rock audience in the US and parts of Europe (partially thanks to the guitar work of Michael Knust from the Texas band Fever Tree, and the similarity of the band's name with that of an album by British prog-rockers, Yes).\n\nIn 1978, Schwartz released his first solo album, featuring collaborations with two dozen Texas musicians with whom he performed live (on guitar for the first time) in a loosely knit group called Guy Schwartz & The Zap Rhythm Band, including Knust, Tausz, Tony Braunagel and Billy Block, each of whom found careers in music.\n\nIn 1980, Schwartz teamed with Randy Soffar and formed Z-ROCKS, a new-wave power-pop band that had 3 minor regional hits fueled by touring with the likes of Duran Duran, Todd Rundgren and Huey Lewis and The News. After their first album was added to over 200 radio stations across the US, it was reviewed as 'too derivative'. Z-ROCKS never released its second album and soon faded.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1997, Schwartz recorded and toured as a sideman, and went back to school (University of Houston) to study video production and digital media to keep up with the new digital music business.\n\nIn 1997, Tausz & Schwartz reunited to update and remix that first solo album, and went on to record another two dozen albums together, forming a band, THE NEW JACK HIPPIES, which toured the US and western Europe from 1999 until 2004, and still performs regionally in Texas. Schwartz tours as a solo, and performs on tour with other bands in their locales. Schwartz' repertiore includes rock songs, blues, funk and americana, with a bit of humor and songs about weed thrown in for good measure.\n\nSince 2001, Schwartz has settled into a 2-year cycle which includes and annual free local original music festival and TV shoot (SOUTH BY DUE EAST – now in its 14th year), production of the TV series, new films and an album of new songs every year or two, and 3–6 months of touring. He's also looked to the past and engineered reunion shows and recordings with The Zap Rhythm Band (new songs – released August 2014) and Z-ROCKS (new recordings of old songs – unreleased). In 2012, Schwartz formed a band full of Austin players (Guy Schwartz & The Affordables) to perform locally in Austin, Texas. A live album and DVD of that experience will be forthcoming in 2014 or 2015.\n\nGuy Schwartz & Marlo Blue formed their SIRIUS HIPPIES PRODUCTIONS and have produced (and Schwartz has directed) several films and television series based upon the careers and live performances of Texas musicians and the Texas music scene, as seen through Schwartz' events, concerts and 'ad hoc' unconventional touring. His film/video career was a natural extension of his local music journalism, and desire to promote the Houston, Texas original music scene, and his music, in the digital age.\n\nDirecting concert films on Billy Joe Shaver, Mr. Scarface and Carolyn Wonderland, as well as films about SOUTH BY DUE EAST and Schwartz' own New Jack Hippies, Schwartz & Blue have created three successful TV series – 'Hippies.TV' (14th season), 'SOUTH BY DUE EAST TELEVISION'(8th season), and 'Guy Schwartz' Road Journal'(4th season).\n\nSchwartz has also created music videos for Texas artists, including Trudy Lynn (2), Steve Krase (2), Tom The Folksinger, Hogan & Moss, and Almost Endless Summer, as well as several videos for his own music releases.\n\nGuy Schwartz has served five elected terms on The Harris County Democratic Party Executive Committee, was a founding volunteer at Houston's Pacifica Radio station KPFT, founding the first 'local music' program on the station in 1975, and has been active in movements to legalize marijuana and protect consumers and the middle class. He and Marlo Blue shoot & record bands and musicians at SOUTH BY DUE EAST (a Guerilla Marketing Experiment, Movie Shoot, & Indie Music Festival in Houston, Texas, USA.) every March since 2003, making TV shows, indie films, radio shows, podcasts and compilation CDs, and put them out there to promote the artists, and the Houston, Texas, USA original music community. They say that they \"give the artists free video and mixed audio and hope it helps.\" Schwartz declared his non-partisan candidacy for the U.S. presidency in August, 2015.\n\n\n"}

The business card of Redfern stated: H. Jasper Redfern, Practical Optician and Scientist, 55 & 57 Surrey Street, Sheffield.\n\nIn 1871, Redfern was born at Sheffield, Yorkshire (West Riding), England. His parents were Walter Shepherd Redfern, age 31 (born at Sheffield, Yorkshire, England) and Sarah Rosebella Redfern, age 35 (born at Waddingham, Lincolnshire, England).\nIn 1881, he was a resident at 40 Nicholson Road in Heeley, Sheffield, Yorkshire (West Riding), England. Redfern had one sister, Amy Eliza Redfern, age 11 and one brother, John William Redfern, age 7.\nIn 1891, he lived with his parents and brother at 110 Pancras Square in St Pancras, London, England. His occupation was recorded as a photographer's apprentice.\nIn 1894, he resided at 22 Stratford place in the Borough of Saint Pancras, East division, London, England. Redfern lived in a room he rented, the \"front room on top floor, unfurnished\" with rent of 11 shillings per week, with partial board, and rent paid to Mrs. Redfern at the same address.\nOn 31 March 1901, Redfern resided at 28 Carter Knowle Road in Sheffield, Yorkshire (West Riding), England. His occupation was a qualified refractionist. Other persons listed in the household were his mother, sister and brother, a boarder, and a visitor.\nIn 1908, he married Charlotte Annie Baldwin at Burnley, Lancashire, England.\nOn 31 October 1928, Redfern died at Manchester, Lancashire, England.\n\nRedfern began in cinema by filming local events, which were referred to as locals. He would stage short, often comic sequences. He presented the productions at screenings of these films in local halls. Later he owned cinema houses, including one at the seaside resort of Westcliff-on-Sea. The small company he controlled was not able to compete with the larger and professionally managed cinema companies, so market forces led to the decline in his business. Redfern operated a photographic studio, and sold cameras (and other optical goods including opera glasses). The cameras, instruments and articles he sold were inscribed with the name \"Jasper Redfern\". Redfern held the credentials FSMC, and BOA The designation FSMC was from the Fellowship in Optometry of the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers. The designation BOA came from membership in the British Optical Association. These were recognised qualifications from the General Optical Council.\n\nIn 1895, he was owner and proprietor of H. Jasper Redfern. In 1898, Redfern as an optician in Sheffield also offered photographic supplies and basic to advanced instruction in photography. He demonstrated Röntgen rays, and held exhibitions of the Lumière Cinématographe. Redfern was an agent for Lumière's Cinématographe in England. At this time Redfern operated in Sheffield from showrooms located at 55–57 Surrey Street and operated the 'Works and Studios' located at 104–106 Norfolk Street. He developed and exploited the niche market of \"locals,\" short film of interest to a limited local area. In 1899, Redfern took on the role of sports photographer and travelled with his local football team. He photographed several major matches including the match at Crystal Palace when Sheffield United played Derby on 15 April 1899 in the Football Cup Final. He chose the title for the series, '’Football Events'’. Redfern was keen with other sports and found time to film local cricket matches, bicycle races and lifeboat competitions.\n\nFrank Mottershaw and Redfern made the first motion pictures filmed outdoors in Sheffield. In 1900, Mottershaw formed the Sheffield Photo Company. A studio was built at Hanover Street and it was here that the motion picture, \"A Daring Daylight Burglary\" was produced in 1903.\n\nIn 1900, Redfern travelled to Africa with stops in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and created travelogues from his journeys. He decided to delve into the animated or moving picture business with his headliner, marqueed as 'World Renowned Animated Pictures and Refined Vaudeville Entertainments'. This routine performance was successful enough for him to own and operate a seaside summer show at Westcliffe, with the inviting name of 'Jasper Redfern's Palace by the Sea'. Redfern pursued the local film business until 1910, when he chose to focus his efforts on the optical and medical trades. Redfern produced and exhibited films up until 1915, before he decided to concentrate on research into x-rays and cancer treatment at Christie Hospital, Manchester. In 1928, Redfern died of cancer. His collection of motion picture memorabilia was donated to the Science Museum.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1895, he worked at the firm of W. Watson and Sons as a photographer's apprentice. Redfern would go on to become an agent for the firm of W. Watson and Son.\n\nIn 1894, Redfern teamed with Fred Holmes as manager. Holmes developed skills as photographer, animated picture operator and projectionist.\nIn September 1896, Redfern presented at the YMCA in Sheffield, a double-bill of film and x-ray demonstrations with a \"Kineopticon\", a projector he obtained from Birt Acres. The Kineopticon had recently been patented by Acres on 27 May 1895 and quickly became popular. Redfern was keen to capitalise of this new invention and took advantage of the public's interest and fascination with these new animated or moving pictures.\nIn 1898, Redfern secured an exclusive contract in England for the right to tour the groundbreaking, first feature film of the Corbett-Fitzsimmons boxing match of 1897. Redfern also secured or produced himself, films of local sporting events, and this proved to be a move towards making the headline feature as an event all by itself. He had the foresight to realise that a satisfied audience would return for future events and become loyal customers and customers that would return week after week. Redfern discovered a new market for the new medium of animated or motion pictures. He found new captive audiences and offered an afternoon's or evening's entertainment to church groups, clubs and societies. His approach helped to secure the public's acceptance for this new medium of film.\n\nDuring the years 1899 to 1905, Holmes accompanied Redfern as he travelled throughout England. Redfern promoted and produced vaudeville and animated show. For two years during the summer tourist season, Redfern operated the 'Palace by the Sea' at Southend-on-Sea. At this location, he took still photographs and animated movies. When Redfern set up the first motion picture house in Sheffield, Holmes became the manager and general manager for Redfern's various endeavours in England. In 1912, Redfern closed the business and Redfern and Holmes no longer worked as a team. Holmes continued to manage the Central Hall in Sheffield.\n\nRedfern returned to his earlier endeavours and experience with the utilisation of x-rays and x-ray photography.\n\nIn 1900, the firm of H. Jasper Redfern was located at 104 – 106 Norfolk Street in Sheffield. From 1901 to 1902, the firm of Jasper Redfern & Co. Ltd. had a location at 1 Orchard Street in Sheffield. From 1901 to 1907, the firm of Jasper Redfern & Co. Ltd. had a location at 53 – 57 Surrey Street in Sheffield. From 1901 to 1907, the firm of Jasper Redfern & Co. Ltd. had a location at 184 – 186 Norfolk Street in Sheffield. From 1905 to 1907, the firm of Jasper Redfern & Co. Ltd. had a location at Central Hall in Sheffield. About 1909, Redfern was issued a licence, good until 1913, in compliance with the Cinematograph Act of 1909.\n\nOn 18 September 1903, the following was published in \"The Photographic News\":\n<poem>\"Jasper Redfern, Limited. – This company has just been registered with a capital of £5,000 in £1 shares, to adopt an agreement between H.

Sergeant Jasper Redfern was assigned to the clinical staff of the 2nd Western General Hospital. In 1914, he enlisted in the RAMC with the much needed skill as radiographer, particularly during wartime. The small x-ray department at the hospital was called upon to use the new technology of x-rays for diagnostic and therapeutic studies. Redfern, a pioneer in the field of x-rays and radiology, accepted the call to serve his fellow wounded soldiers. He became a martyr by performing radiographs and paid the price by losing all of his fingers from the radiation exposure. In 1928, Redfern died of cancer, probably due to his heroic efforts and prolonged exposure to radiation from x-rays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Leander fell in love with Hero and would swim every night across the Hellespont to spend time with her. Hero would light a lamp at the top of her tower to guide his way.\n\nSuccumbing to Leander's soft words and to his argument that Aphrodite, as the goddess of love, would scorn the worship of a virgin, Hero allowed him to make love to her. Their trysts lasted through a warm summer. But one stormy winter night, the waves tossed Leander in the sea and the breezes blew out Hero's light; Leander lost his way and was almost drowned by Neptune in a case of mistaken identity. Leander manages to reach Hero's tower and there they consummate their love. Neptune angrily waits for Leander after this interaction.\n\nThe myth of Hero and Leander has been used extensively in literature and the arts:\n\n\nShakespeare also alludes to the story in \"Much Ado About Nothing\", both when Benedick states that Leander was \"never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love\" and in the name of the character Hero, who, despite accusations to the contrary, remains chaste before her marriage; and in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" in the form of a malapropism accidentally using the names Helen and Limander in the place of Hero and Leander, as well as in Edward III (Act II, Scene II), Othello (Act III, Scene III), and Romeo and Juliet (Act II, Scene IV).\n\nThe most famous Shakespearean allusion is the debunking one by Rosalind, in Act IV scene I of \"As You Like It\":\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em\">\n\"Both robbed of air, we both lie in one ground,\"\n\"Both whom one fire had burnt, one water drowned\".</poem>\n\n"}
{"id": "33848159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33848159", "title": "Hynek Krušina of Lichtenburg", "text": "Hynek Krušina of Lichtenburg\n\nHynek Krušina of Lichtenburg (also: \"Henry Kruschina of Lichtenburg\", in ; 1392 – 4 March 1454, Kłodzko (, )) was a Hussite commander and governor and lien holders of the County of Kladsko, the Duchy of Münsterberg and the city of Ząbkowice Śląskie ().\n\nHynek Kruschina was a member of the Lichtenburg family, which in turn was a branch of the powerful Ronow dynasty. His father was John Krušina of Lichtenburg, who was a Royal Colonel and Chamberlain and Burgrave of the Duchy of Jawor.\n\nAfter his father died, Hynek was influenced by Čeněk of Wartenberg. Čeněk probably persuaded Hynek to participate in the Bohemian Diet of 1415, where he protested against the condemnation of Jan Hus at the Council of Constance. Hynek and his brothers Alexander (who died ) and John inherited his possessions of Opočno, Kumburk Castle and Albrechtice. As Alexander and John were still minors, Hynek acted as their guardian and regent. However, Queen Sophie of Bavaria claimed Albrechtice as part of her jointure. Hynek would not accept the loss of Albrechtice and a military conflict broke out, which was decided in 1414 in favour of the Queen. Probably as a result of this conflict, Hynek found himself in financial difficulties and was forced to sell Opočno, which he had intended to give to John when the latter came of age. To compensate for this, he purchased the Lordship of Hostinné from Tristan of Redern.\n\nIn 1420 at Wrocław, Hynek and his brother John and other Bohemian nobles openly defied Emperor Sigismund. Shortly thereafter he was appointed captain of a Hussite army at the Battle of Vysehrad. Later that year, at Mount Oreb in Třebechovice pod Orebem near Hradec Králové, he founded the Orebites, a federation of East Bohemian towns which was led by the priest Ambrož Hradecký and pursued egalitarian goals.\n\nIn 1425 or later Hynek married to Anna Zajíc of Hasenburg, a daughter of William Zajíc of Hasenburg, who was an outspoken opponent of the Hussites and sided with emperor Sigismund. Anna and Hynka had a son name William (born: before 1430; died around 1487), whom they had named in honor of his maternal grandfather.\n\nHynek opposed the atrocities committed by the Taborites, but nevertheless participated in the Battle of Aussig in 1426. In 1428, he changed sides and submitted himself to the emperor. He then returned to his own estates.\n\nHynek's brother John was murdered in 1434, after a dispute with the city council of Broumov. After John's death, the Lordship of Hostinné fell back to Hynek. In 1437, King Sigismund gave him the Lordship of Miletín, which his father had already held from 1404 to 1407.\n\nIn February 1437 he attended the coronation of Emperor Sigismund's wife Barbara as Queen consort of Bohemia. After Sigismund died in December 1437, Hynek supported the candidacy of Sigismund's son Albert II. After Albert was elected as King of Bohemia, Hynek was allowed to bear the royal sword at the coronation ceremony on 29 June 1438 the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague and took part as seneschal in the subsequent celebrations. In October 1438, Albert had to leave Prague to avert a Polish invasion in Silesia and afterwards travelled to Hungary to repel the Turks. He appointed a council to support governor Oldrich Celský. Hynek was a member of this council, along with Meinhard of Neuhaus and Hanuš of Kolowrat.\n\nIn late 1430s, Hynek tried to expand his possessions in eastern Bohemia. On 6 September 1440, he purchased the liens over the Lordship of Glatz, the Duchy of Münsterberg, the city of Ząbkowice Śląskie and some East Bohemian possessions, from Anna of Koldice, the widow of Půta III of Častolovice. Her East Bohemian possessions included Nové Hrady, Rychmberk Castle, Potštejn, Albrechtice, Choceň, Hummel and Častolovice. Anna's mother-in-law, also named Anna (died in 1454 or earlier), the daughter of Jan II of Oświęcim and the widow of Půta II of Častolovice, still resided in Častolovice; Hynek conceded the usufruct of Častolovice to her for the rest of her life. He also took over Půta III's debt and undertook to raise Půta's three daughters, Anna, Catherine and Salome, befittingly.\n\nThe negotiations for the sale seem to have been accelerated by the kidnapping of Anna's eldest daughter (who was also called Anna). In the summer of 1440, she was taken by Sigismund of Reichenau from Kłodzko Castle to Chałupki Castle, which he held as a fief of the bishop of Wrocław. Sigismund wanted to marry Anna (the daughter), in order to obtain part of her father's inheritance. Anna (the mother), instead sold her husband's possessions to Hynek and married him three weeks later, on 29 September 1440. She hoped that Hynek would be able to arrange the release of her daughter. Hynek began by negotiating with Konrad of Oels, the bishop of Wrocław. He demanded that Anna be released and Sigismund be punished. In order to put pressure on Konrad, Hynek began to loot the Duchy of Nysa. On 29 December 1440, Konrad promised to dispossess Sigismund, release Anna and transfer Chałupki Castle to Anna's relatives. However, Konrad hesitated to intervene. In early 1441, Hynek besieged Chałupki Castle and freed his stepdaughter. Sigismund and his accomplices managed to escape to another episcopal property, the nearby Kaltenštejn Castle. As Konrad had promised, Hynek could keep the castle. He installed his own vogt and some troops on the castle.\n\nIn July 1441, Emperor Sigismund's widow Barbara returned to Bohemia to take possession of her wittum. Hynek accompanied her on the route from Kłodzko to Hradec Králové, where she was received by Hynek Ptáček of Pirkstein, and other Bohemian nobles. Hynek had approached Hynek Ptáček the year before, when the Utraquists met in Nymburk. In August 1441, Hynek joined the Landfrýd, a regional alliance of nobles and cities to keep the peace, at its meeting in Čáslav. At this meeting, he probably came into contact with the robber baron Jan Kolda of Žampach, who held Rychmberk Castle and the Lordship of Hummel illegally. These possessions were legally Hynek's, as he had purchased them from Anna of Koldice in 1440.\n\nDiscord remained between Hynek and Bishop Konrad, probably because of Hynek's utraquist sympathies and his Hussite past. Over the next few years, it led to military conflicts in which other Silesian princes were involved. Most of them rejected Hynek's claim on Duchy of Münsterberg, with the Estates of Münsterberg, headed by Captain Frederick Stosch playing a crucial role. In order to deter them and underline his claims on Münsterberg, Hynek sacked on 20 July 1442, the monastery at Henryków, to which the citizens of Münsterberg had a special relationship. When Hynek attacked again, aiming to conquer the Duchy, the citizens of Münsterberg were able to repel him.\n\nOn 25 April 1443, the citizens of Münsterberg elected Duke William of Opava (1410–1452) as their new sovereign. He was a member of the Přemyslid dynasty and his mother Catherine was a sister of Duke John I, who had been the last Duke of Münsterberg of the Piast line. Although William had married Hynek's stepdaughter Salome, the daughter of Anna of Koldice and the late Půta of Častolovice, a short time earlier, he became one of Hynek's opponents.\n\nOn 15 and 16 July 1443, Duke William of Opava and Münsterberg, Bishop Konrad of Wrocław and their allies besieged Chałupki Castle and took it. The city of Ząbkowice Śląskie, which at the time belonged to the Lordship of Kłodzko, was also besieged. Karpień Castle, which Hynek has used as his base when he attacked the Diocese of Wrocław, was captured and destroyed.\n\nThe situation calmed down in the summer of 1444. By the end of 1444, the dispute between Hynek and William of Münsterberg, although he never gave up his claim on Münsterberg. Also in 1444, Hynek finally gained control over the Lordship of Hummel, which he had legally owned since 1440. Hummel Castle, however, remained a den of thieves. Soldiers holding he castle charged high tariffs from merchants and travellers who passed the castle on their way to Hummel Pass.\n\nIn 1446 in the parliament at Prague, Hynek signed a petition to the Pope, asking him to acknowledge the Compact of Prague and recognize Jan Rokycana as archbishop.\n\nOn 27 April 1452, Hynek attended the parliament at Prague where George of Poděbrady was elected as regent of Bohemia. It was intended that George would exercise this rôle until the newly elected King Ladislaus Postumus came of age. However, Ladislaus died in 1457 and in 1458, George was himself elected King of Bohemia. On 16 October 1452, Parliament adopted a motion, which was then brought to Vienna by a high-level delegation, which included Hynek.\n\nHynek spent his final years in Kłodzko, and died there in 1454. In Kłodzko, he was respected, because he had managed to keep the country out of the wars in the 1441 to 1445 time frame. He also enjoyed a reputation of religious tolerance. He was buried in the Augustinian monastery in Kłodzko. He had been the monastery's benefactor and had always had good relationships with it. On 9 December 1455 Hynek's widow Anna endowed a benefice \"that hymns may be sung at Krušina's grave every Tuesday\". In an obituary published by the monastery at Kamieniec Ząbkowicki, Hynek was described as a loyal patron ().\n\nA few weeks after Hynek's death, his son William — probably due to a preliminary contract concluded by Hynek — sold the possessions that had belonged to the Častolovice family, including the Lordship of Hummel, the lien of Kłodzko and the city of Ząbkowice Śląskie to George of Poděbrady, who would later be elected King of Bohemia and who already owned the adjacent Lordship of Náchod. This allowed George to extend his family's possessions in Eastern Bohemia. In 1456, he purchased the Duchy of Münsterberg from Ernest of Opava, thereby increasing his influence in Silesia. In 1459, George raised the Lordship of Kłodzko to a County, known in German as the County of Glatz.\n\nWilliam did not initially sell the Lordships of Hostinné and Kumburk, the original possessions of the Lichtenburg family. For reasons unknown, William later sold Hostinné to his stepmother, Anna of Coldice. He only retained the Lordship of Kumburk with Kumburk Castle, which his heirs retained until the end of the 15th century, and the Lordship of Miletín, which his heirs sold in 1522.\n\nWilliam Krušina's sons John, Hynek, Bernhard and Smil acquired Trutnov in 1527. Bernhard had two sons, also named Hynek and John. John died childless in 1539, leaving Hynek's son John Bernhard (who died in 1590), as the last member of the Krušina branch of the Lichtenburg family.\n\n"}

He participated in the uprising since day one, and was an important \"oborknez\" of the Šabac district, and was one of the most courageous commanders, so influential as a military and political leader that he was held by many as the second only to Karađorđe Petrović, the leader, in Šumadija.\n\nJanko was born in Rogača, beneath the Kosmaj. In his youth he mostly lived in Belgrade with his sister, who was married to a Turk. In this time he learnt Turkish, which would benefit him later on. He however, came into bad terms with his sister's husband, and was forced to leave and return to Rogača. In the region the Uprising was planned and he joined the uprising and was appointed as the \"knez\" of one of the former Ottoman nahiyah, and as he was known for being just, prudent and heroic, he quickly became the head commander of the Belgrade nahija. He had a good appearance, and in the assemblies he was a good speaker, and in the battles he was very adaptive, adroit and heroic chief. He was popular with the people, and his contemporaries called him \"prude and heroic Janko\". He was one of the most important figures of the First Uprising.\n\nHe participated in all battles since the beginning: Belgrade, Rudnik, Vrbica, etc. He, Vasa Čarapić and Sima Marković commanded 4,000 soldiers that besieged Belgrade. Karđorđe sent him to the fighting in Mačva, in 1806, as help. He showed great skills, and after the burning of the Sovljak village, he killed 65 Turks and took what they had confiscated earlier. He died while fighting the Ottomans around Šabac, in the village of Krnić, just before the Battle of Mišar.\n\nHis death was a huge loss for the Serbian revolutionaries. Although he was a close friend of Karađorđe, he was part of the political group that sought to tackle the Vožd's autocracy. Several more revolutionaries came from his family.\n\n"}

{"id": "11984401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11984401", "title": "Konrad Dannenberg", "text": "Konrad Dannenberg\n\nDannenberg was born in Weißenfels, Province of Saxony (current Saxony-Anhalt). At the age of two, he and his family moved to Hannover, where he spent his youth. He became interested in space technology while attending a lecture by Max Valier, a German pioneer in that field. He witnessed two tests with a rocket-driven railroad car in Burgwedel near Hannover and then joined Albert Püllenberg's group of amateur rocketeers. Dannenberg studied mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule Hannover (current University of Hannover) with emphasis in diesel fuel injection, because he recognized that injectors would also be part of the process of moving propellants into a high-pressure rocket engine.\n\nWhen World War II began, Dannenberg, a member of the Nazi party since 1932, was drafted into the German Army in 1939, serving first with a horse-artillery unit acquired by the German Army in Czechoslovakia. He took part in the initial stages of the Battle of France.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, through the influence of Püllenberg, Dannenberg was discharged from the army and became a civilian employee at the Heeresversuchsanstalt Peenemünde (Peenemünde Army Research Center). Under Walter Thiel's guidance, he became a rocket propulsion specialist. His main assignment was developing a rocket engine for the V-2 ballistic missile. He was at Peenemünde on 3 October 1942 to witness the launch of the first man-made object to reach outer space, a V-2 rocket. This was the first man-made vehicle to reach space based on a then-current definition of 50 miles in altitude (see Kármán line for relevant background). Many improvements on which he worked could not be completed in time for production. After Thiel's death in an August 1943 bombing raid, a design freeze stopped all development efforts. Dannenberg then became Walter Riedel's deputy and headed the crash effort to finalize production drawings of the V-2, the world's first ballistic missile, used by the Nazis to bomb London.\nHe was interviewed for the documentary \"The Hunt for Hitler's Scientists.\"\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Dannenberg was brought to the United States with 117 other German specialists under Operation Paperclip to Fort Bliss, Texas. Most members of the group performed calculations and designs of future advanced launch vehicles with longer ranges and greater payloads. About 30 members trained the U.S. Army and the support contractor General Electric to launch V-2s at the White Sands Proving Ground. Due to range limitations, all rockets were launched vertically, to limit their range. Robert H. Goddard's idea of upper atmosphere research could now be conducted on a large scale. When the Korean War started, the group was required to leave their quarters in an Annex to the Wm. Beaumont Hospital, and were eventually transferred to the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Alabama, where development of the PGM-11 Redstone Missile was their first assignment. At that time, rocket pioneer and former SS major Wernher von Braun decided not to start their own rocket engine development, but to purchase an engine from North American Aviation (NAA) that was being developed by Dannenberg's former boss, Riedel, who had previously left the team to join NAA. Due to these circumstances, Dannenberg became Liaison Engineer at NAA's Rocketdyne Division and procured rocket engines for the Redstone and the Jupiter IRBM for the U.S. Army. He also became responsible for production of the Redstone and Jupiter missile systems for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency at the Chrysler plant in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn 1960, Dannenberg joined NASA's newly established Marshall Space Flight Center as Deputy Manager of the Saturn program. He received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1973 for successfully initiating development of the largest rocket ever built, the Saturn V, which took the first human beings to the moon.\n\nWhen Arthur Rudolph came back from the Army's development of the Pershing missile system, von Braun assigned the management of the Saturn system to him. Dannenberg then started to work on Saturn-based space stations, which were eventually replaced by the Space Shuttle-based ISS.\n\nDannenberg retired from the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1973 and became an Associate Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) in Tullahoma, Tennessee.\n\nDannenberg was a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and past president of the Alabama/Mississippi Chapter of this organization. In 1990, he received the prestigious DURAND Lectureship, and in 1996, the Hermann Oberth Award.\n\nHe lectured on basic rocketry at the United States Space Camp.\n\nHe was a member of the NASA/MSFC Retirees Association, an honorary member of the Hermann Oberth Society of Germany and a charter member of the L5 Society, which is now the National Space Society (NSS). In 1992, the Alabama Space and Rocket Center established \"The Konrad Dannenberg Scholarship\" in his honor, which grants the winning youngster free admittance to a Space Academy session. He attended many meetings of the International Astronautical Federation and presented a number of historical papers in their sessions.\n\nWith his wife Ingeborg M. Kamke (now deceased), Dannenberg had a son, Klaus Dieter, who has two married children. From them Dannenberg had four great grandchildren. He had remarried to Jacquelyn E. Staiger of Kingston, Massachusetts. Dannenberg died in Huntsville on the morning of Monday, February 16, 2009, at the age of 96. He is buried at Maple Hill Cemetery (Huntsville, Alabama).\n\n"}

{"id": "729760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=729760", "title": "List of United States Navy ratings", "text": "List of United States Navy ratings\n\nUnited States Navy ratings are general enlisted occupations used by the U.S. Navy from the 18th century, which consisted of specific skills and abilities. Each naval rating had its own specialty badge, which is worn on the left sleeve of the uniform by each enlisted person in that particular field. Working uniforms, such as coveralls and the camouflage Naval Working Uniform, bear generic rate designators with no rating insignia attached. For a brief period from September 2016 to December 2016, ratings were not used. However, they were reintroduced in December 2016 and remain in use.\n\nJust as a naval officer has rank, not a rate, an officer's occupation (if drawn more narrowly than an officer of the line) is classified according to designators for both officers of the line (e.g., line officers) and those of the professional staff corps.\n\nRatings should not be confused with \"rates\", which describe the Navy's enlisted pay-grades and ratings. Enlisted sailors are referred to by their rating and pay-grade. For example, if a sailor's has the pay-grade of E-5 (petty officer second class) and the rating of boatswain's mate, then combining the two—boatswain's mate second class (BM2)—defines both pay-grade and rating in formal address or epistolary salutation. Thus, boatswain's mate second class (BM2) would be that sailor's rate. A member that is E-1, E-2, or E-3 that belongs to a general occupational field (airman, constructionman, fireman, hospitalman, or seaman) is considered nonrated. A striker is a nonrated person who is working for promotion towards a specific rating. Example: BMSN, MMFA, AOAR.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's enlisted occupational system was a product of more than 200 years of Naval evolution. The Navy of the United Colonies of the 1775 era offered only a few different jobs above the ordinary level of seaman. These included boatswain's mate, quartermaster, gunner's mate, master-at-arms, cook, armorer, and coxswain. These were titles of the jobs that individuals were actually performing and became the basis for petty officers and ratings. During this time, ship crews were taken from civilian life and enlisted for only one cruise, thus making the job at hand rather than career possibilities the primary consideration. It was not until 1841 that distinguishing marks for a rating were prescribed in the Regulations of the Secretary of the Navy and specialty marks were not added to enlisted men's uniforms until 1866. The marks consisted of the tools or instruments used in each rating's specific duty. The Master-at-Arms, the police officer of a ship, wore the star of authority and the Gunner's Mate wore two crossed cannons. Currently, all specialty marks for new ratings are approved by the Permanent Naval Uniform Board which is a division of the Bureau of Naval Personnel.\n\nAs the U.S. Navy's rating system changed so did the U.S. Navy. The first steamship, mine, radar, torpedo, aircraft carrier, and many other \"firsts\" all established a new era in the Navy, and each directly impacted the enlisted occupation structure. During World War II, the U.S. Navy also briefly maintained a rating of \"Specialist\", similar to the rank in the United States Army. The rating of \"Specialist\" was discontinued in 1948.\n\nSince the establishment of the rating system, the U.S. Navy enlisted rating structure played a key role in career development, served as a basis for training, detailing, advancement, and simply keeping tabs on several hundred thousand U.S. Navy sailors.\n\nBeginning in June 2016, then Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, Michael D. Stevens oversaw a review of the Navy's existing enlisted rating system. After Steven's retirement, a group of senior enlisted leaders came to the conclusion that the Navy needed to replace its current enlisted system and announced the changes 29 September 2016 with the release of NAVADMIN 218/16. The changes would have eliminated ratings in favor of the generic titles of \"Seaman\" (E-1 to E-3) or \"Petty Officer\" (E-4 to E-6) and accompanying Navy Occupational Specialty (NOS) codes. The U.S. Navy stated that the decision was motivated by a desire to assist former sailors obtain employment after their naval service by making naval job titles more congruent with their civilian counterparts, as well as to make said titles more unisex.\n\nHowever, the \"overwhelmingly unpopular decision\" was not well received by many sailors as many had grown accustomed and attached to their ratings, viewing them as a source of morale. In response to widespread criticism, ratings were restored on 20 December 2016. CNO Richardson indicated he still intended to change the personnel system in the future.\n\nThe pay grades E-4 (petty officer third class) through E-9 (master chief petty officer) fall within the rating structure. It is further broken down into four types of ratings and classifications:\nThe word \"rate\" is used in two ways within the structure. First, rate is a paygrade. Enlisted navy personnel do not have rank: only naval officers do. Second, rate is an abbreviation that contains both the rating and the paygrade abbreviations. For example, a boatswain's mate has the rating abbreviation BM, and if the person is a Petty Officer Second Class which is a \"2\" abbreviation, then the person's rate would be BM2 (BM is the rating and the 2 is petty officer second class paygrade E-5). The paygrade abbreviation is always added right after the rating abbreviation. The rates (paygrades) are as follows:\n\nPaygrades E-1 through E-3 can also have a rating abbreviation preceding their paygrade symbol if they are graduates of Class \"A\" schools; have received the rating designation in a previous enlistment; are assigned to a billet in that specialty as a \"striker\"; have passed an advancement examination and not been selected for advancement for reasons of numeric limitations on advancements; or have been reduced in rate because of punishment. Examples: BMSR is a boatswain's mate seaman recruit (paygrade E-1); MMFA is a machinist's mate fireman apprentice (paygrade E-2); MRFN is a machinery repairman fireman (paygrade E-3). HN is hospitalman, which is a hospital corpsman with the paygrade of E-3.\n\nI: ABE, ABF, and ABH combine at paygrade E-9 to the rate of \"Master chief aviation boatswain's mate (ABCM)\".\nII: AM, AME, and AD combine at paygrade E-9 to the rate of \"Master chief aircraft maintenanceman (AFCM)\".\nIII: AE and AT combine at paygrade E-9 to the rate of \"Master chief avionics technician (AVCM)\".\nIV: 2009 AW rating merged with all other aircrew NEC's and changed their title from aviation warfare system operators to naval aircrewman.\n\nI: BU, EA, and SW combine, as follows:\nII: CE and UT combine at paygrade E-9 to the rating of \"Master chief utilitiesman (UCCM)\".\nIII: CM and EO combine at paygrade E-9 to the rating of \"Master chief equipmentman (EQCM)\".\n\nI: Cryptologic technician now includes former rating of electronic warfare technician (EW).\nII: Information systems technician now includes former rating of cryptologic technician – communications (CTO).\nIII: Quartermaster QM now exists as electronics technician (navigation) ETV on submarines.\n\nI: The Navy has announced a merger of the DC, HT and MR ratings into repair technician (RT) is pending but has not announced a timeline.\nII: Prior to March 1 March 2014, IC and EM combine at paygrade E-9 to the rating of master chief electrician's mate (EMCM). After 1 March 2014, IC is moving to the Seaman ratings group.\n\n\n"}

Aushev had taken over the opposition website, Ingushetia.org, after its owner, Magomed Yevloyev, a vocal critic of the Ingush government, was shot and killed while in police custody.\n\nAushev was a businessman and a member of a prominent Ingushetian family. In 2007, Aushev's son and nephew were both kidnapped. He blamed Ingush security forces under the control of then-President of Ingushetia Murat Zyazikov for the abductions. Aushev organized protests against the security forces and the Zyazikov government.\n\nIn 2008, journalist Magomed Yevloyev, the owner of Ingushetia.org and a critic of the Zyazikov government, was shot and killed while in police custody. Aushev personally took over ownership of Ingushetia.org following Yevloyev's death.\n\nThe Russian government removed Zyazikov in October 2008 and installed Yunus-Bek Yevkurov as president. Yevkurov offered dissidents in Ingushetia a certain amount of protection from politically motivated attacks. Aushev largely supported Yevkurov policies towards the opposition, and withdrew from his most vocal opposition to the government since Yevkurov's installation. Aushev accepted a position on a human rights council set up by the ombudsman of Russia's federal government. However, he remained a vocal critic of former President Zyazikov and his relatives, as well as the human rights violations allegedly committed by Russian special forces in Ingushetia and Chechnya.\n\nAushev survived an attempted kidnapping in September 2009.

She was the founder and president of the Marilou Díaz-Abaya Film Institute and Arts Center, a film school based in Antipolo City, Philippines. She was the director of the 1998 film \"José Rizal\", a biographical film on the Philippines' national hero. She meticulously produced films for over twenty years and was part of the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema.\nDíaz was born in Quezon City in 1955. She was one of seven Children of lawyers, Conrado Diaz and Felicitas Correa Diaz. She grew up quite privileged. Her father is from Paoay, Ilocos Norte, and is related to Valentin Diaz, who was one of the founding signatories in 1892 of the nationalist association La Liga Filipina with Jose Rizal, whom her famous film was about.\n\nMarilou and her siblings grew up in a house filled with art that was instituted by their parents who were art collectors. On the walls of their house hung several painting by national artist Fernando Amorsolo. Diaz-Abaya and her siblings were forced by their parents to take up piano classes and ballet classes. According to Diaz-Abaya, later on, as she became a filmmaker, she realized the importance of art in her youth.\n\nGrowing up, Diaz-Abaya was not a film buff, and rather had more interest in literature and history.\n\nAn event that lead Diaz-Abaya to film was her applying for Communication Arts in the Assumption Convent. She intended to enroll for Asian Civilizations studies, but was not able to because the History Department was closed. Because of this she enrolled for Communication Arts and intended to stay for only one semester, but her love for theater acting free. During her time in college, she produced plays at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Also in college, she was able to direct her first film.\nShe studied in several private schools (at St. Theresa's College from Kindergarten to High School), eventually graduating from Assumption College with a degree in Bachelor of Arts, major in Communication Arts in 1976. She went to Los Angeles for further studies and graduated from Loyola Marymount University with a degree in Master of Arts in Film and Television in 1978. She then went to London and completed the Film Course at London International Film School also in 1978.\n\nShe burst into the Philippine cinema world in the 1980s as a feminist director, yet she recalled growing up in a gender-free atmosphere.\nDiaz-Abaya’s films are known for the struggles of the marginalized, and yet she never thought of a career in filmmaking while growing up in private Catholic schools for the elite.\n\nDiaz-Abaya and her husband, after living in London, went back to the Philippines and got together with some theater friends to start an independent film company, Cine Filipinas, which was funded by their parents. Though Diaz-Abaya and her film company were able to produce films together, their films flopped at the box office and lost money. After this event, she met Jesse Ejercito, an independent film producer who recognized and enjoyed the cinematography and art direction of Diaz-Abaya’s film Tanikala.\n\nDíaz directed and released her first feature film, \"Tanikala (Chains)\" in 1980. Since then, she has been one of the most active and visible directors in Philippine cinema.\n\nJesse Ejercito gave Diaz-Abaya the opportunity to make a film and Diaz-Abaya proposed to have Ricky Lee, whom she has only heard of and not met, as a writer for her film. Ricky Lee would then be known as one of Diaz-Abaya’s collaborators in film and credited as the screenplay writer for several of Diaz-Abaya’s films. Lee and Diaz-Abaya’s first collaboration was making Brutal, which premiered at the Metro Manila Film Festival in 1980. Brutal was a success and Ishmael Bernal, a highly regarded Filipino filmmaker, saw the film and wanted to meet Diaz-Abaya. Bernal became Diaz-Abaya’s mentor.After her success with Brutal, she then directed Macho Gigolo. \n\nHer early films \"Brutal\", \"Karnal (Of the Flesh)\", and \"Alyas Baby Tsina\", sharply condemn the oppressive social system during the administration of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. When the Marcos was deposed in 1986, Diaz left filmmaking.\n\nDíaz produced television programs for several years. Her work attempts to reflect the social and political problems to attain social reform. She admittedly uses her work as a tool to uphold, promote, and protect the state of democracy in the Philippines.\n\nMarilou Diaz-Abaya was the treasurer of the directors’ union under Lino Brocka for several years. In 1983, Diaz-Abaya joined the Concerned Artists of the Philippines, organized by Lino Brocka, and was an active member that opposed film censorship by the Marcos regime and joined in anti-government rallies.\n\nIn the early 80s, Lily Monteverde, a prominent Filipino film producer for Regal productions, asked Diaz-Abaya to make Sensual (Of The Senses), a coming of age film that covered sexual topics. It premiered one day before the 1986 EDSA revolution against the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nIn 1995, she again directed films, beginning with the release of \"Ipaglaban Mo (Redeem Her Honor)\". She continued directing such films as \"May Nagmamahal Sa Iyo (Madonna and Child)\", \"Sa Pusod Ng Dagat (In the Navel of the Sea)\", \"José Rizal\", and \"Muro Ami (Reef Hunters)\". Her body of work is a continuous examination of difficult social problems in the country. Her works often deal with the lives of the Filipino poor, women, and children who struggle to survive under harsh conditions.\n\nArguably her most famous work, \"José Rizal\", featured actor and 2007 Philippine senatorial candidate César Montano playing the national hero as an ordinary human being, artist, and struggling doctor.\n\nA Japanese award-giving body described her body of work to be \"harmoniously blending entertainment, social consciousness, and ethnic awareness.\" The organization continued by saying: \"(Her work) has won acclaim both in the Philippines and abroad for its high level of artistic achievement. It is an ideal manifestation of the artistic culture of Asia, and so is most deserving of the Arts and Culture Prize of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes.\"\n\nShe was married to cinematographer and educator Manolo Abaya and they have two sons: singer/actor Marc Abaya and David Abaya, a cinematographer. Her nephew, José Emilio \"Jun\" Abaya, who was Congressman of Cavite and became Secretary of Transportation and Communication.\n\nShe met Manolo when she was 15 years of age, and Manolo helped her turn to filmmaking. Marilou and Manolo got married in Manila and soon after, went to live in London as Marilou studied at the London International Film School. Manolo and Abaya would work together. Manolo would usually be credited as the director of photography and editor for most of Diaz-Abaya’s work.\nDíaz-Abaya was diagnosed with breast cancer, which caused her death on October 8, 2012.\n\nDíaz is the 2001 Laureate of the Fukuoka Prize for Culture and the Arts in Japan. She has won numerous directing awards from award-giving bodies such as the Metro Manila Film Festival, the Urian Awards, the Film Academy of the Philippines, the Famas Awards, the Star Awards, the Catholic Mass Media Awards the British Film Institute Award, the International Federation of Film Critics Award (FIPRESCI), and the Network of Pan Asian Cinema Award (NETPAC).\n\nDíaz was an active film and television producer and director. She was a director of the Film Development Council of the Philippines, the president of the Marilou Diaz-Abaya Film Institute and Arts Center and Dive Solana Inc., a film instructor at the Ateneo de Manila University, a trustee of the Jesuit Communications Foundation and the AMANU Media Apostolate, and a member of the Silsilah Dialogue Movement for Peace, the Artists for Peace, the Mothers for Peace, and the World Association of Psycho-Socio Rehabilitation.\n\nDíaz directed at least twenty-one (21) full-length feature films which include internationally exhibited films with English titles and subtitles.

{"id": "20065598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20065598", "title": "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi", "text": "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi (, ; 26 October 1919 – 27 July 1980), also known as Mohammad Reza Shah (محمدرضاشاه Mohamad Rezā Ŝāh), was the last Shah of Iran from 16 September 1941 until his overthrow by the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979. Mohammad Reza Shah took the title \"Shahanshah\" (\"King of Kings\") on 26 October 1967. He was the second and last monarch of the House of Pahlavi. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi held several other titles, including that of \"Aryamehr\" (\"Light of the Aryans\") and \"Bozorg Arteshtaran\" (\"Commander-in-Chief\"). His dream of what he referred to as a \"Great Civilisation\" () in Iran led to a rapid industrial and military modernisation, as well as economic and social reforms.\n\nMohammad Reza came to power during World War II after an Anglo-Soviet invasion forced the abdication of his father, Reza Shah Pahlavi. During Mohammad Reza's reign, the Iranian oil industry was briefly nationalised, under Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, until a US and UK-backed coup d'état deposed Mosaddegh and brought back foreign oil firms. Under Mohammad Reza's reign, Iran marked the anniversary of 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy since the founding of the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great – concurrent with this celebration, Mohammad Reza changed the benchmark of the Iranian calendar from the hegira to the beginning of the First Persian Empire, measured from Cyrus the Great's coronation. Mohammad Reza also introduced the White Revolution, a series of economic, social and political reforms with the proclaimed intention of transforming Iran into a global power and modernising the nation by nationalising certain industries and granting women suffrage.\n\nMohammad Reza gradually lost support from the Shi'a clergy of Iran as well as the working class, particularly due to his strong policy of modernisation, \"laïcité\", conflict with the traditional class of merchants known as bazaari, relations with Israel, and corruption issues surrounding himself, his family, and the ruling elite. Various additional controversial policies were enacted, including the banning of the communist Tudeh Party and a general suppression of political dissent by Iran's intelligence agency, SAVAK. According to official statistics, Iran had as many as 2,200 political prisoners in 1978, a number which multiplied rapidly as a result of the revolution.\n\nSeveral other factors contributed to strong opposition to the Shah amongst certain groups within Iran, the most significant of which were US and UK support for his regime, and clashes with leftists and Islamists. By 1979, political unrest had transformed into a revolution which, on 17 January, forced him to leave Iran. Soon thereafter, the Iranian monarchy was formally abolished, and Iran was declared an Islamic republic led by Ruhollah Khomeini. Facing likely execution should he return to Iran, he died in exile in Egypt, whose president, Anwar Sadat, had granted him asylum. Due to his status as the last Shah of Iran, he is often known as simply \"The Shah\".\n\nBorn in Tehran, to Reza Khan (later Reza Shah Pahlavi) and his second wife, Tadj ol-Molouk, Mohammad Reza was the eldest son of Reza Khan, who later became the first Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty, and the third of his eleven children. His father, a former Brigadier-General of the Persian Cossack Brigade, was of Mazandarani and Georgian origin. His father was born in Alasht, Savadkuh County, Māzandarān Province. Mohammad Reza's paternal grandmother, Noush-Afarin, was a Muslim immigrant from Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), whose family had emigrated to mainland Iran after Iran was forced to cede all of its territories in the Caucasus following the Russo-Persian Wars several decades prior to Reza Khan's birth. Mohammad Reza's mother, Tadj ol-Molouk, was of Azerbaijani origin, being born in Baku, Russian Empire (now Azerbaijan).\nMohammad Reza was born along with his twin sister, Ashraf. However, Shams, Mohammad Reza, Ashraf, Ali Reza, and their older half-sister, Fatimeh, were not royalty by birth, as their father did not become Shah until 1925. Nevertheless, Reza Khan was always convinced that his sudden quirk of good fortune had commenced in 1919 with the birth of his son who was dubbed \"khoshghadam\" (bird of good omen). Like most Iranians at the time, Reza Khan did not have a surname and after the 1921 Persian coup d'état which deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, he was informed that he would need a name for his house. This led Reza Khan to pass a law ordering all Iranians to take a surname; he chose for himself the surname Pahlavi, which is the name for Middle Persian (language) that itself is derived from Old Persian. At his father's coronation on 24 April 1926, Mohammad Reza was proclaimed Crown Prince.\n\nMohammad Reza described his father in his book \"Mission for My Country\" as \"one of the most frightening men\" he had ever known, depicting Reza Khan as a dominating man with a violent temper. A tough, fierce, and very ambitious soldier who became the first Persian to command the elite Russian-trained Cossack Brigade, Reza Khan liked to kick subordinates in the groin who failed to follow his orders; growing up under his shadow, Mohammad Reza was a deeply scarred and insecure boy who lacked self-confidence. Reza Khan believed if fathers showed love for their sons, it caused homosexuality later in life, and to ensure his favourite son was heterosexual, denied him any love and affection when he was young, though he later become more affectionate towards the Crown Prince when he was a teenager. Reza Khan always addressed his son as \"shoma\" (\"sir\") and refused to use more informal \"tow\" (\"you\"), and in turn was addressed by his son using the same word. The Polish journalist Ryszard Kapuściński observed in his book \"Shah of Shahs\" that looking at old photographs of Reza Khan and his son, he was struck by how self-confident and assured Reza Khan appeared in his uniform while Mohammad Reza appeared nervous and jittery in his uniform standing next to his father. In the 1930s, Reza Khan was an outspoken admirer of Hitler, though this was less because of any racism and anti-Semitism on his part, but rather because Reza Khan saw Hitler as someone much like himself, namely a man who had risen from an undistinguished background to become a notable leader of the 20th century. Reza Khan often impressed on his son his belief that history was made by great men such as himself, and that a real leader is an autocrat. Reza Khan was a huge barrel-chested and muscular man towering at over 6'4, leading his son to liken him to a mountain, and throughout his life, Mohammad Reza was obsessed with height and stature, for example wearing elevator shoes to make himself look taller than he really was, often boasting that Iran's highest mountain Mount Demavand was higher than any peak in Europe or Japan, and he was always most attracted to tall women. As Shah, Mohammad Reza constantly disparaged his father in private, calling him a thuggish Cossack who achieved nothing as Shah, and most notably the son almost airbrushed his father out of history during his reign, to the point that the impression was given the House of Pahlavi began its rule in 1941 rather than 1925.\n\nMohammad Reza's mother, Tadj ol-Molouk was an assertive woman who was also very superstitious. She believed that dreams were messages from another world, sacrificed lambs to bring good fortune and scare away evil spirits, and clad her children with protective amulets to ward off the power of the evil eye. Tadj ol-Molouk was the main emotional support to her son, cultivating a belief in him that destiny had chosen him for great things, as the soothsayers she consulted had explained her dreams as proving just precisely that. Mohammad Reza grew up surrounded by women, as the main influences on him were his mother, his older sister Shams and his twin sister Ashraf, leading the American psychologist Marvin Zonis to conclude it was \"... from women, and apparently from women alone\" that the future Shah\" \"received whatever psychological nourishment he was able to get as a child\". Traditionally, male children were considered preferable to females, and as a boy, Mohammad Reza was often spoiled by his mother and sisters. Mohammad Reza was very close to his twin sister Ashraf as she noted: \"It was this twinship and this relationship with my brother that would nourish and sustain me throughout my childhood ... No matter how I would reach out in the years to come-sometimes even desperately-to find an identity and a purpose of my own, I would remain inextricably tied to my brother ... always, the center of my existence was, and is, Mohammad Reza\".\n\nAfter becoming Crown Prince, Mohammad Reza was taken away from his mother and sisters to be given a \"manly education\" by officers selected by his father, who also ordered that everyone including his mother and siblings were to address the Crown Prince as \"Your Highness\". The result of his upbringing between a loving, if possessive and superstitious mother and an overbearing martinet father was to make Mohammad Reza in the words of Zonis \"... a young man of low self-esteem who masked his lack of self-confidence, his indecisiveness, his passivity, his dependency and his shyness with masculine bravado, impulsiveness, and arrogance\", making him into a person of marked contradictions as the Crown Prince was \"both gentle and cruel, withdrawn and active, dependent and assertive, weak and powerful\".\n\nBy the time Mohammad Reza turned 11, his father deferred to the recommendation of Abdolhossein Teymourtash, the Minister of Court, to dispatch his son to Institut Le Rosey, a Swiss boarding school, for further studies. Mohammad Reza left Iran for Switzerland on September 7, 1931. On his first day as a student at Le Rosey in September 1931, the Crown Prince antagonised a group of his fellow students who were sitting on a bench in a park outside Le Rosey with his demand that they all stand to attention as he walked past, just as everybody did back in Iran, which led to an American student beating up Mohammad Reza, who swiftly learned to accept that no one would stand to attention wherever he went in Switzerland. As a student, Mohammad Reza played competitive football, but the school records indicate that his principal problem as a football player was his \"timidity\" as the Crown Prince was afraid to take risks. The Crown Prince was educated in French at Le Rosey, and his time there left Mohammad Reza with a lifelong love of all things French. In articles he wrote in French for the student newspaper in 1935 and 1936, Mohammad Reza praised Le Rosey for broadening his mind and introducing him to European civilisation. Mohammad Reza lost his virginity to a maid who worked at Le Rosey in 1935.\n\nMohammad Reza was the first Iranian prince in line for the throne to be sent abroad to attain a foreign education and remained there for the next four years before returning to obtain his high school diploma in Iran in 1936. After returning to the country, the Crown Prince was registered at the local military academy in Tehran where he remained enrolled until 1938, graduating as a Second Lieutenant. Upon graduating, Mohammad Reza was quickly promoted to the rank of Captain, a rank which he kept until he became Shah. During college, the young prince was appointed Inspector of the Army and spent three years travelling across the country, examining both civil and military installations.\n\nDuring his time in Switzerland, Mohammad Reza befriended Ernest Perron, the son of a gardener who worked at Le Rosey and who would become his best friend and \"twin\". Perron, an eccentric, effeminate man who dressed in a campy style, walked with a limp and who did little to hide his homosexuality, was often beaten up by the students until one day Mohammad Reza came to his defence. Perron, who fancied himself a poet introduced Mohammad Reza to French poetry and under his influence Chateaubriand and Rabelais became his \"favorite French authors\".\n\nThe Crown Prince liked Perron so much that when he returned to Iran in 1936, he brought Perron back with him, installing his best friend in the Marble Palace. Perron lived in Iran until his death in 1961 and as the best friend of Mohammad Reza was a man of considerable behind-the-scenes power. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, a best-selling book was published by the new regime, \"Ernest Perron, the Husband of the Shah of Iran\" by Mohammad Pourkian, alleging a homosexual relationship between the Shah and Perron, which remains the official interpretation in the Islamic Republic to the present day. Zonis described the book as long on assertions and short on evidence of a homosexual relationship between the two, noted that all of the Shah's courtiers denied that Perron was the Shah's lover, and argued that strong-willed Reza Khan, who was very homophobic, would not have allowed Perron to move into the Marble Palace in 1936 if he believed Perron was his son's lover.\n\nThe Iranian-American historian Abbas Milani argued that Perron was Mohammad Reza's \"self-object\", a person somebody chooses to act as extension of their personality and to bolster their self-esteem. Milani argued that, given the way in which the macho Reza Khan had often attacked his son for a lack of manliness and said he wanted his son to have a \"manly education\" to teach him some \"machismo\", that for the heterosexual Mohammad Reza to have an effeminate man like Perron around eased his doubts about his own masculinity.\n\nOne of the main initiatives of Iranian and Turkish foreign policy had been the Saadabad pact of 1937, an alliance bringing together Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, with the intent of creating a Muslim bloc that would hopefully deter any aggressors. President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey suggested to his friend Reza Khan during the latter's visit to Turkey that a marriage between the Iranian and Egyptian courts would be beneficial for the two countries and their dynasties, as it might lead to Egypt joining the Saadabad pact. In line with this suggestion, Mohammad Reza and Princess Fawzia married. Dilawar Princess Fawzia of Egypt (5 November 1921 – 2 July 2013), a daughter of King Fuad I of Egypt and Nazli Sabri, was a sister of King Farouk I of Egypt. They married on 15 March 1939 in the Abdeen Palace in Cairo. Reza Shah did not participate in the ceremony. During his visit to Egypt, Mohammad Reza was greatly impressed with the grandeur of the Egyptian court as he visited the various palaces built by the Isma'il Pasha, aka \"Isma'il the Magnificent\", the famously free-spending Khedive of Egypt, and resolved that Iran needed palaces to match those built by Isma'il.\n\nMohammad Reza's marriage to Fawzia produced one child, a daughter, Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi (born 27 October 1940). Their marriage was not a happy one as the Crown Prince was openly unfaithful, often being seen driving around Tehran in one of his expensive cars with one of his girlfriends. Mohammad Reza's dominating and extremely possessive mother saw her daughter-in-law as a rival to her son's love, and took to humiliating Princess Fawzia, whose husband sided with his mother. A quiet, shy woman, Fawzia described her marriage as miserable, feeling very much unwanted and unloved by the Pahlavi family and longing to go back to Egypt. In his 1961 book \"Mission For My Country\", Mohammad Reza wrote the \"only happy light moment\" of his entire marriage to Fawzia was the birth of his daughter.\n\nIn the midst of World War II in 1941, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union, breaking the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. This had a major impact on Iran, which had declared neutrality in the conflict. In the summer of 1941, Soviet and British diplomats passed on numerous messages warning that they regarded the presence of a number of Germans administering the Iranian state railroads as a threat, implying war if the Germans were not dismissed. Britain wished to ship arms to the Soviet Union via Iranian railroads, and statements from the German managers of the Iranian railroads that they would not cooperate made both Moscow and London insistent that the Germans Reza Khan had hired to run his railroads had to be sacked at once. As his father's closest advisor, the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza did not see fit to raise the issue of a possible Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, blithely assuring his father that nothing would happen. The Iranian-American historian Abbas Milani wrote about the relationship between the Reza Khan and the Crown Prince: \"As his father's now constant companion, the two men consulted on virtually every decision\".\nLater that year British and Soviet forces occupied Iran in a military invasion, forcing Reza Shah to abdicate. On 25 August 1941, British and Australian naval forces attacked the Persian Gulf while the Soviet Union conducted a land invasion from the north. On the second day of the invasion with the Soviet air force bombing Tehran, Mohammad Reza was shocked to see the Iranian military simply collapse, with thousands of terrified officers and men all over Tehran taking off their uniforms in order to desert and run away despite the fact they had not seen combat yet. Reflecting the panic, a group of senior Iranian generals called the Crown Prince to receive his blessing to hold a meeting to discuss how best to surrender. When Reza Khan learned of the meeting, he flew into a rage and attacked one of his generals, Ahmad Nakhjavan, striking him with his riding crop, tearing off his medals and was about to personally execute him when his son persuaded him to have the general court-martialed instead. The collapse of the Iranian military in the summer of 1941 that his father had worked so hard to build up humiliated his son, who vowed that he would never see Iran defeated like that again, which explained Mohammad Reza's later obsession with military spending.\n\nOn 16 September 1941, Prime Minister Forughi and Foreign Minister Ali Soheili attended a special session of parliament to announce the resignation of Reza Shah and that Mohammad Reza was to replace him. The next day, at 4:30pm, Mohammad Reza took the oath of office and was received warmly by parliamentarians. On his way back to the palace, the streets filled with people welcoming the new Shah jubilantly, seemingly more enthusiastic than the Allies would have liked. The British would have liked to put a Qajar back on the throne, but the principal Qajar claimant to the throne was Prince Hamid Mirza, an officer in the Royal Navy who did not speak Persian, so the British had to accept Mohammad Reza as Shah. The main Soviet interest in 1941 was to ensure political stability to ensure Allied supplies, which meant accepting the throne. Subsequent to his succession as king, Iran became a major conduit for British and, later, American aid to the USSR during the war. This massive supply effort became known as the Persian Corridor.\n\nMuch of the credit for orchestrating a smooth transition of power from the King to the Crown Prince was due to the efforts of Mohammad Ali Foroughi. Suffering from angina, a frail Foroughi was summoned to the Palace and appointed prime minister when Reza Shah feared the end of the Pahlavi dynasty once the Allies invaded Iran in 1941. When Reza Shah sought his assistance to ensure that the Allies would not put an end to the Pahlavi dynasty, Foroughi put aside his adverse personal sentiments for having been politically sidelined since 1935. The Crown Prince confided in amazement to the British Minister that Foroughi \"hardly expected any son of Reza Shah to be a civilized human being\", but Foroughi successfully derailed thoughts by the Allies to undertake a more drastic change in the political infrastructure of Iran.\nA general amnesty was issued two days after Mohammad Reza's accession to the throne on 19 September 1941. All political personalities who had suffered disgrace during his father's reign were rehabilitated, and the forced unveiling policy inaugurated by his father in 1935 was overturned. Despite the young king's enlightened decisions, the British Minister in Tehran reported to London that \"the young Shah received a fairly spontaneous welcome on his first public experience, possibly rather [due] to relief at the disappearance of his father than to public affection for himself\". During his early days as Shah, Mohammad Reza lacked self-confidence and spent most of his time with Perron writing poetry in French.\n\nIn 1942, Mohammad Reza met Wendell Willkie, the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency in the 1940 election who was now on a world tour for President Roosevelt to promote his \"one world\" policy; Willkie took him flying for the first time. The prime minister Ahmad Qavam had advised the Shah against flying with Wilkie, saying he had never met a man with a worse flatulence problem, but the Shah took his chances. Mohammed Reza told Willkie that when he was flying he \"wanted to stay up indefinitely\". Enjoying flight, Mohammad Reza hired the American pilot Dick Collbarn to teach him how to fly. Upon arriving at the Marble Palace, Collbarn noted that \"the Shah must have twenty-five custom-built cars...Buicks, Cadillacs, six Rolls-Royces, a Mercedes\". During the Tehran conference in 1943, the Shah was humiliated when he met Joseph Stalin, who visited him in the Marble Palace and did not allow the Shah's bodyguards to be present, with the Red Army alone guarding the Marble Palace during Stalin's visit.\n\nDespite his public professions of admiration in later years, Mohammad Reza had serious misgivings about not only the coarse and roughshod political means adopted by his father, but also his unsophisticated approach to affairs of state. The young Shah possessed a decidedly more refined temperament, and amongst the unsavory developments that \"would haunt him when he was king\" were the political disgrace brought by his father on Teymourtash; the dismissal of Foroughi by the mid-1930s; and Ali Akbar Davar's suicide in 1937. An even more significant decision that cast a long shadow was the disastrous and one-sided agreement his father had negotiated with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) in 1933, one which compromised the country's ability to receive more favourable returns from oil extracted from the country.\n\nMohammad Reza expressed concern for his exiled father who had previously complained to the British governor of Mauritius that living on the island was both a climatic and social prison. Attentively following his life in exile, Mohammad Reza would object to his father's treatment to British at any opportunity. The two sent letters to one another, although delivery was often delayed, and Mohammad Reza commissioned his friend, Ernest Perron, to hand-deliver a taped message of love and respect to his father, bringing back with him a recording of his voice.\n\nMy dear son, since the time I resigned in your favour and left my country, my only pleasure has been to witness your sincere service to your country. I have always known that your youth and your love of the country are vast reservoirs of power on which you will draw to stand firm against the difficulties you face and that, despite all the troubles, you will emerge from this ordeal with honour. Not a moment passes without my thinking of you and yet the only thing that keeps me happy and satisfied is the thought that you are spending your time in the service of Iran. You must remain always aware of what goes on in the country. You must not succumb to advice that is self-serving and false. You must remain firm and constant. You must never be afraid of the events that come your way. Now that you have taken on your shoulders this heavy burden in such dark days, you must know that the price to be paid for the slightest mistake on your part may be our twenty years of service and our family's name. You must never yield to anxiety or despair; rather, you must remain calm and so strongly rooted in your place that no power may hope to move the constancy of your will.\n\nIn 1945-46, the main issue in Iranian politics were the Soviet-sponsored separatist government in Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, which greatly alarmed the Shah. He repeatedly clashed with his prime minister Ahmad Qavam, whom he viewed as too pro-Soviet. At the same time, the growing popularity of the Tudeh Party also worried Mohammad Reza, who felt there was a serious possibility of a coup by the Tudeh. In June 1946, Mohammad Reza was relieved when the Red Army pulled out of Iran. In a letter to the Azerbaijani Communist leader Ja'far Pishevari, Stalin stated that he had to pull out of Iran as otherwise the Americans would not pull out of China, and he wanted to assist the Chinese Communists in their civil war against the Kuomintang. However, the Pishevari regime remained in power in Tabriz, and Mohammad Reza sought to undercut Qavam's attempts to make an agreement with Pishevari as way of getting rid of both. On 11 December 1946, the Iranian Army led by the Shah in person entered Iranian Azerbaijan and the Pishevari regime collapsed with little resistance, with most of the fighting occurring between ordinary people who attacked functionaries of the Pishevari regime who had behaved brutally. In his statements at the time and later, Mohammad Reza credited his easy success in Azerbaijan to his \"mystical power\". Knowing Qavam's penchant for corruption, the Shah used that issue as a reason to sack him. By this time, Fawzia had returned to Egypt, and despite efforts to have King Farouk persuade her to return to Iran she refused to go, which led Mohammad Reza to divorce her on 17 November 1947.\n\nA qualified pilot, Mohammad Reza was fascinated with flying and the technical details of aeroplanes, any insult to him was always an attempt to \"clip my wings\". Mohammad Reza directed more money to the Imperial Iranian Air Force than any branch of the armed forces, and his favourite uniform was that of the Marshal of the Imperial Iranian Air Force. Zonis wrote that Mohammad Reza's obsession with flying reflected an Icarus complex, also known as \"ascensionism\", a form of narcissism based on \"a craving for unsolicited attention and admiration\" and the \"wish to overcome gravity, to stand erect, to grow tall ... to leap or swing into the air, to climb, to rise, to fly ...\".\n\nBesides an obsession with transcending gravity by flying, men with an Icarus complex tend to see women merely as sexual objects, which fitted in with Mohammad Reza, who was well known as a womaniser who often spoke of women as sexual objects who existed only to gratify him, which led to his celebrated 1973 exchange with Fallaci, who vehemently objected to his attitudes towards women. As a regular visitor to the nightclubs of Italy, France and the United Kingdom, Mohammad Reza was linked romantically to several actresses including Gene Tierney, Yvonne De Carlo and Silvana Mangano.\n\nThe young Shah was also the target of at least two unsuccessful assassination attempts. On 4 February 1949, he attended an annual ceremony to commemorate the founding of Tehran University. At the ceremony, Fakhr-Arai fired five shots at him at a range of c. three metres. Only one of the shots hit the king, grazing his cheek. Fakhr-Arai was instantly shot by nearby officers. After an investigation, it was thought that Fakhr-Arai was a member of the Tudeh Party, which was subsequently banned. However, there is evidence that the would-be assassin was not a Tudeh member but a religious fundamentalist member of Fada'iyan-e Islam. The Tudeh were nonetheless blamed and persecuted.\n\nThe Shah's second wife was Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari, a half-German half-Iranian woman and the only daughter of Khalil Esfandiary, Iranian Ambassador to West Germany, and his wife, the former Eva Karl. She was introduced to the Shah by Forough Zafar Bakhtiary, a close relative of Soraya's, via a photograph taken by Goodarz Bakhtiary, in London, per Forough Zafar's request. They married on 12 February 1951, when Soraya was 18 according to the official announcement; however, it was rumoured that she was actually 16, the Shah being 32. As a child she was tutored and brought up by Frau Mantel, and hence lacked proper knowledge of Iran, as she herself admits in her personal memoirs, stating, \"I was a dunce—I knew next to nothing of the geography, the legends of my country, nothing of its history, nothing of Muslim religion.\"\n\nBy the early 1950s, the political crisis brewing in Iran commanded the attention of British and American policy leaders. In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh was appointed prime minister. He was committed to nationalising the Iranian petroleum industry controlled by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) (as Anglo-Persian Oil Company or APOC had become). Under the leadership of Mosaddegh and his nationalist movement, the Iranian parliament unanimously voted to nationalise the oil industry—thus shutting out the immensely profitable AIOC, which was a pillar of Britain's economy and provided it political clout in the region.\n\nAt the start of the confrontation, American political sympathy was forthcoming from the Truman Administration. In particular, Mosaddegh was buoyed by the advice and counsel he was receiving from the American Ambassador in Tehran, Henry F. Grady. However, eventually American decision-makers lost their patience, and by the time a Republican Administration came to office, fears that communists were poised to overthrow the government became an all-consuming concern; these concerns were later dismissed as \"paranoid\" in retrospective commentary on the coup from US government officials. Shortly prior to the 1952 presidential election in the United States, the British government invited CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt Jr., to London to propose collaboration on a secret plan to force Mosaddegh from office. This would be the first of three \"regime change\" operations led by Allen Dulles (the other two being the successful CIA-instigated 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état and the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba).\n\nUnder the direction of Kermit Roosevelt Jr., a senior Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer and grandson of former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the American CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) funded and led a covert operation to depose Mosaddegh with the help of military forces disloyal to the government. Referred to as Operation Ajax, the plot hinged on orders signed by Mohammad Reza to dismiss Mosaddegh as prime minister and replace him with General Fazlollah Zahedi, a choice agreed on by the British and Americans.\n\nDespite the high-level coordination and planning, the coup initially failed, causing the Shah to flee to Baghdad, and then to Rome. During his time in Rome, a British diplomat reported about a monarch who spent most of his time in nightclubs with Queen Soraya or his latest mistress: \"He hates taking decisions and cannot be relied on to stick to them when taken. He has no moral courage and succumbs easily to fear\". To get him to support the coup, his twin sister Princess Ashraf, who was much tougher than him and publicly questioned his manhood several times, visited him on 29 July 1953 to berate him into signing a decree dismissing Mossaddegh. After a brief exile in Italy, he returned to Iran, this time through a successful second attempt at a coup. A deposed Mosaddegh was arrested and tried. The king intervened and commuted the sentence to three years, to be followed by life in internal exile. Zahedi was installed to succeed Mosaddegh.\nBefore the first attempted coup, the American Embassy in Tehran reported that Mosaddegh's popular support remained robust. The Prime Minister requested direct control of the army from the Majlis. Given the situation, alongside the strong personal support of Conservative Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for covert action, the American government gave the go-ahead to a committee, attended by the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, Henderson, and Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson. Kermit Roosevelt returned to Iran on 13 July 1953, and again on 1 August 1953, in his first meeting with the king. A car picked him up at midnight and drove him to the palace. He lay down on the seat and covered himself with a blanket as guards waved his driver through the gates. The Shah got into the car and Roosevelt explained the mission. The CIA bribed him with $1 million in Iranian currency, which Roosevelt had stored in a large safe – a bulky cache, given the then exchange rate of 1,000 rial to 15 dollars.\n\nThe Communists staged massive demonstrations to hijack Mosaddegh's initiatives, and the United States actively plotted against him. On 16 August 1953, the right wing of the Army attacked. Armed with an order by the Shah, it appointed General Fazlollah Zahedi as prime minister. A coalition of mobs and retired officers close to the Palace executed this coup d'état. They failed dismally and the Shah decided to leave the country. \"Ettelaat\", the nation's largest daily newspaper, and its pro-Shah publisher, Abbas Masudi, were against him, calling the defeat \"humiliating\".\n\nDuring the following two days, the Communists turned against Mosaddegh. Opposition against him grew tremendously. They roamed Tehran, raising red flags and pulling down statues of Reza Shah. This was rejected by conservative clerics like Kashani and National Front leaders like Hossein Makki, who sided with the king. On 18 August 1953, Mosaddegh defended the government against this new attack. Tudeh partisans were clubbed and dispersed.\nThe Tudeh party had no choice but to accept defeat. In the meantime, according to the CIA plot, Zahedi appealed to the military, claimed to be the legitimate prime minister and charged Mosaddegh with staging a coup by ignoring the Shah's decree. Zahedi's son Ardeshir acted as the contact between the CIA and his father. On 19 August 1953, pro-Shah partisans – bribed with $100,000 in CIA funds – finally appeared and marched out of south Tehran into the city centre, where others joined in. Gangs with clubs, knives, and rocks controlled the streets, overturning Tudeh trucks and beating up anti-Shah activists. As Roosevelt was congratulating Zahedi in the basement of his hiding place, the new Prime Minister's mobs burst in and carried him upstairs on their shoulders. That evening, Henderson suggested to Ardashir that Mosaddegh not be harmed. Roosevelt gave Zahedi US$900,000 left from Operation Ajax funds.\n\nUS actions further solidified sentiments that the West was a meddlesome influence in Iranian politics. In the year 2000, reflecting on this notion, US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright stated:\n\nIn 1953 the United States played a significant role in orchestrating the overthrow of Iran's popular prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The Eisenhower Administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons; but the coup was clearly a setback for Iran's political development. And it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal affairs.\n\nMohammad Reza returned to power, but never extended the elite status of the court to the technocrats and intellectuals who emerged from Iranian and Western universities. Indeed, his system irritated the new classes, for they were barred from partaking in real power.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1953 coup d'état, Mohammad Reza was widely viewed as a figurehead monarch, and General Fazlollah Zahedi, the Prime Minister, saw himself and was viewed by others as the \"strong man\" of Iran. Mohammad Reza feared that history would repeat itself, remembering how his father was a general who had seized power in a coup d'état in 1921 and deposed the last Qajar shah in 1925, and his major concern in the years 1953–55 was to neutralise Zahedi. American and British diplomats in their reports back to Washington and London in the 1950s were openly contemptuous of Mohammad Reza's ability to lead, calling the Shah a weak-willed and cowardly man who was incapable of making a decision. The contempt in which the Shah was held by Iranian elites led to a period in the mid 1950s where the elite displayed fissiparous tendencies, feuding amongst themselves now that Mossadegh had been overthrown, which ultimately allowed Mohammad Reza to play off various factions in the elite to assert himself as the nation's leader. The very fact that Mohammad Reza was considered a coward and something of an airhead turned out be an advantage as the Shah proved to be an adroit politician, playing off the factions in the elite and the Americans against the British with the aim of being an autocrat in practice as well in theory. Supporters of the banned National Front were persecuted, but in his first important decision as leader, Mohammad Reza intervened to ensure most of the members of the National Front brought to trial such as Mosaddegh himself were not executed as many had expected. Many in the Iranian elite were openly disappointed that Mohammad Reza did not conduct the expected bloody purge and hang Mosaddegh and his followers as they had wanted and expected. In 1954, when 12 university professors issued a public statement criticising the 1953 coup, all were dismissed from their jobs, but in the first of his many acts of \"magnanimity\" towards the National Front, Mohammad Reza intervened to have them reinstated. Mohammad Reza tried very hard to co-opt the supporters of the National Front by adopting some of their rhetoric and addressing their concerns, for example declaring in several speeches his concerns about the Third World economic conditions and poverty which prevailed in Iran, a matter that had not much interested him before.\nMohammad Reza was determined to copy Mosaddegh, who had won popularity by promising broad socio-economic reforms, and wanted to create a mass powerbase as he did not wish to depend upon the traditional elites, who only wanted him as a legitimising figurehead. In 1955, Mohammad Reza dismissed General Zahedi from his position as prime minister and appointed his archenemy, the technocrat Hossein Ala' as prime minister, whom he in turn dismissed in 1957. Starting in 1955, Mohammad Reza began to quietly cultivate left-wing intellectuals, many of whom had supported the National Front and some of whom were associated with the banned Tudeh party, asking them for advice about how best to reform Iran. It was during this period that Mohammad Reza began to embrace the image of a \"progressive\" Shah, a reformer who would modernise Iran, who attacked in his speeches the \"reactionary\" and \"feudal\" social system that was retarding progress, bring about land reform and give women equal rights. Determined to rule as well as reign, it was during the mid 1950s that Mohammad Reza started to promote a state cult around Cyrus the Great, portrayed as a great Shah who had reformed the country and built an empire with obvious parallels to himself. Alongside this change in image, Mohammad Reza started to speak of his desire to \"save\" Iran, a duty that he claimed he had been given by God, and promised that under his leadership Iran would reach a Western standard of living in the near future. During this period, Mohammad Reza sought the support of the \"ulema\", and resumed the traditional policy of persecuting those Iranians who belonged to the Baha'i faith, allowing the chief Baha'i temple in Tehran to be razed in 1955 and bringing in a law banning the Baha'i from gathering together in groups. A British diplomat reported in 1954 that Reza Khan \"... must have been spinning in his grave at Rey. To see the arrogance and effrontery of the mullahs once again rampant in the holy city! How the old tyrant must despise the weakness of his son, who allowed these turbulent priests to regain so much of their reactionary influence!\". By this time, the Shah's marriage was under strain as Queen Soraya complained about the power of Mohammad Reza's best friend Ernest Perron, whom she called a \"shetun\" (an insulting Persian term that translates roughly as a \"piece of shit\") and a \"limping devil\". Perron was a man much resented for his influence over Mohammad Reza and was often described by enemies as a \"diabolical\" and \"mysterious\" character, whose position was that of a private secretary, but who was one of the Shah's closest advisors, holding far more power than his job title suggested.\nIn a 1957 study done by the State Department, Mohammad Reza was praised for his \"growing maturity\" and no longer needing \"to seek advice at every turn\" as the previous 1951 study had concluded. On 27 February 1958, a military coup to depose the Shah led by General Valiollah Gharani was thwarted, which led to a major crisis in Iranian-American relations when evidence emerged that associates of Gharani had met American diplomats in Athens, which the Shah used to demand that henceforward no American officials could meet with his opponents. Another issue in American-Iranian relations was Mohammad Reza's suspicion that The United States was insufficiently committed to his defence, noting that Americans refused to join the Baghdad Pact, and military studies had indicated that Iran could only hold out for a few days in the event of a Soviet invasion. In January 1959, the Shah began negotiations on a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, which he claimed to have been driven to by a lack of American support. After receiving a mildly threatening letter from President Eisenhower warning him against signing the treaty, Mohammad Reza chose not to sign, which led to a major Soviet propaganda effort calling for his overthrow. Khrushchev ordered Mohammad Reza assassinated. A sign of Mohammad Reza's power came in 1959 when a British company won a contract with the Iranian government that was suddenly cancelled and given to Siemens instead. An investigation by the British embassy soon uncovered the reason why: Mohammad Reza wanted to bed the wife of the Siemens sales agent for Iran, and the Siemens agent had consented to allowing his wife to sleep with the Shah in exchange for winning back the contract that he had just lost. On 24 July 1959, Mohammad Reza gave Israel \"de facto\" recognition by allowing an Israeli trade office to be opened in Tehran that functioned as a \"de facto\" embassy, a move that offended many in the Islamic world. When President Eisenhower visited Iran on 14 December 1959, he was told by Mohammad Reza that Iran faced two main external threats, the Soviet Union in the north and the new pro-Soviet revolutionary government in Iraq, which led him to ask for vastly increased American military aid, saying his country was a front-line state in the Cold War that needed as much military power as possible.\nThe Shah and Soraya's controversial marriage ended in 1958 when it became apparent that, even with help from medical doctors, she could not bear children. Soraya later told the \"New York Times\" that the Shah had no choice but to divorce her, and that he was heavy-hearted about the decision. However, even after the marriage, it is reported that the Shah still had great love for Soraya, and it is reported that they met several times after their divorce and that she lived her post-divorce life comfortably as a wealthy lady, even though she never remarried; being paid a monthly salary of about $7,000 from Iran. Following her death in 2001 at the age of 69 in Paris, an auction of the possessions included a three-million-dollar Paris estate, a 22.37 carat diamond ring and a 1958 Rolls-Royce.\n\nPahlavi subsequently indicated his interest in marrying Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy, a daughter of the deposed Italian king, Umberto II. Pope John XXIII reportedly vetoed the suggestion. In an editorial about the rumours surrounding the marriage of a \"Muslim sovereign and a Catholic princess\", the Vatican newspaper, \"L'Osservatore Romano\", considered the match \"a grave danger\", especially considering that under the 1917 Code of Canon Law a Roman Catholic who married a divorced person would be automatically, and could be formally, excommunicated.\n\nIn the 1960 U.S. elections, the Shah had favoured the Republican candidate Richard Nixon, whom he had first met in 1953 and rather liked, and according to the diary of his best friend Asadollah Alam contributed money to the 1960 Nixon campaign. Relations with the victor of the 1960 election, the Democrat John F. Kennedy were not friendly. In an attempt to mend relations after Nixon's defeat, Mohammad Reza sent General Teymur Bakhtiar of SAVAK to meet Kennedy in Washington on 1 March 1961. From Kermit Roosevelt, Mohammad Reza learned that Bakhtiar, during his trip to Washington, had asked the Americans to support a coup he was planning, which greatly increased the Shah's fears about Kennedy. On 2 May 1961, a teacher's strike involving 50, 000 people began in Iran, which Mohammad Reza believed was the work of the CIA. Mohammad Reza had to sack his prime minister Jafar Sharif-Emami and give in to the teachers after learning that the Army probably would not fire on the demonstrators. In 1961, Bakhtiar was dismissed as chief of SAVAK and expelled from Iran in 1962 following a clash between demonstrating university students and the army on 21 January 1962 that left three dead. In April 1962, when Mohammad Reza visited Washington, he was met with demonstrations by Iranian students at American universities, which he believed were organised by U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, who was the leading anti-Pahlavi voice in the Kennedy administration. Afterwards, Mohammad Reza visited London. In a sign of the changed dynamics in Anglo-Iranian relations, the Shah took offence when he was informed he could join Queen Elizabeth II for a dinner at Buckingham Palace that was given in somebody else's honour, insisting successfully he would have dinner with the queen only when given in his own honour.\n\nReza's first major clash with Ayatollah Khomeini took place in 1962 when Reza changed the local laws for swearing in members of municipal councils, to allow Iranian Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and Baha'i to take the oath of office using their holy books, instead of the Koran. Khomeini wrote to the Shah to say this was unacceptable and that only the Koran could be used to swear in members of the municipal councils regardless of what their religion was, writing that he heard \"Islam is not indicated as a precondition for standing for office and women are being granted the right to vote...Please order all laws inimical to the sacred and official faith of the country to be eliminated from government policies\". The Shah wrote back, addressing Khomeini as \"Hojat-al Islam\" rather than as Ayatollah, declining his request. Feeling pressure from demonstrations organised by the clergy, the Shah withdraw the offending law, but it was reinstated with the White Revolution of 1963.\n\nIn 1963, Mohammad Reza launched the White Revolution, a series of far-reaching reforms, which caused much opposition from the religious scholars. They were enraged that the referendum approving of the White Revolution in 1963 allowed women to vote, with the Ayatollah Khomeini saying in his sermons that the fate of Iran should never be allowed to be decided by women. In 1963 and 1964, nationwide demonstrations against Mohammad Reza's rule took place all over Iran with the centre of the unrest being the holy city of Qom. Students studying to be imams at Qom were most active in the protests, and Ayatollah Khomeini emerged as one of the leaders, giving sermons calling for the Shah's overthrow. At least 200 people were killed, with the police throwing some students to their deaths from high buildings, and Khomeini was exiled to Iraq in August 1964.\n\nThe second attempt on the Shah's life occurred on 10 April 1965. A soldier shot his way through the Marble Palace. The assassin was killed before he reached the royal quarters. Two civilian guards died protecting the Shah.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Kuzichkin – a former KGB officer who defected to the SIS – the Shah was also allegedly targeted by the Soviet Union, who tried to use a TV remote control to detonate a bomb-laden Volkswagen Beetle. The TV remote failed to function. A high-ranking Romanian defector Ion Mihai Pacepa also supported this claim, asserting that he had been the target of various assassination attempts by Soviet agents for many years.\n\nMohammad Reza 's third and final wife was Farah Diba (born 14 October 1938), the only child of Sohrab Diba, a captain in the Imperial Iranian Army (son of an Iranian ambassador to the Romanov Court in St. Petersburg, Russia), and his wife, the former Farideh Ghotbi. They were married in 1959, and Queen Farah was crowned Shahbanu, or Empress, a title created specially for her in 1967. Previous royal consorts had been known as \"Malakeh\" (Arabic: \"Malika\"), or Queen. The couple remained together for twenty one years, until the Shah's death. Farah Diba bore him four children:\n\nOne of Mohammad Reza's favourite activities was watching films and his favourites were light French comedies and Hollywood action films, much to the disappointment of Farah who tried hard to interest him in more serious films. Mohammad Reza was frequently unfaithful towards Farah, and his right-hand man Asadollah Alam regularly imported tall European women for \"outings\" with the Shah, though Alam's diary also mentions that if women from the \"blue-eyed world\" were not available, he would bring the Shah \"local product\". Mohammad Reza had an insatiable appetite for sex, and Alam's diary has the Shah constantly telling him he needed to have sex several times a day, every day, or otherwise he would fall into depression. When Farah found out about his affairs in 1973, Alam blamed the prime minister Amir Abbas Hoveyda while the Shah thought it was the KGB, and Milani noted neither admitted it was the Shah's \"crass infidelities\" that caused this issue. Milani further wrote that \"Alam, in his most destructive moments of sycophancy, reassured the Shah - or his \"master\" as he calls him - that country was prosperous and no one begrudged the King a bit of fun\". He also had a passion for automobiles and aeroplanes, and by the middle 1970s, the Shah had amassed one of the world's largest collection of luxury cars and planes. His visits to the West were invariably the occasions for major protests by the Confederation of Iranian Students, an umbrella group of left-wing Iranian university students studying abroad, and Mohammad Reza had one of the world's largest security details as he lived in constant fear of assassination.\n\nMilani described Mohammad Reza's court as open and tolerant, noting that his and Farah's two favourite interior designers, Keyvan Khosravani and Bijan Saffari, were openly gay, and were not penalised for their sexual orientation with Khosravani often giving advice to the Shah about how to dress. Milani noted the close connection between architecture and power in Iran as architecture is the \"poetry of power\" in Iran. In this sense, the Niavaran Palace, with its mixture of modernist style, heavily influenced by current French styles and traditional Persian style, reflected Mohammad Reza's personality. Mohammad Reza was a Francophile whose court had a decidedly French ambiance to it. However, when he commissioned a documentary from the French film-maker Albert Lamorisse meant to glorify Iran under his rule, he was annoyed that Lamorisse focused only on Iran's past, writing to Lamorisse there was no modern buildings in his film, which he charged made Iran look \"backward\". Mohammad Reza's office was functional whose ceilings and walls were decorated with Qajar art. Farah began collecting art and by the early 1970s owned works by Picasso, Gauguin, Chagall, and Braque, which added to the modernist feel of the Niavaran Palace\n\nOn 26 October 1967, twenty-six years into his reign as Shah (\"King\"), he took the ancient title \"Shāhanshāh\" (\"Emperor\" or \"King of Kings\") in a lavish coronation ceremony held in Tehran. He said that he chose to wait until this moment to assume the title because in his own opinion he \"did not deserve it\" up until then; he is also recorded as saying that there was \"no honour in being Emperor of a poor country\" (which he viewed Iran as being until that time).\n\nAs part of his efforts to modernise Iran and give the Iranian people a non-Islamic identity, Mohammad Reza quite consciously started to celebrate Iranian history before the Arab conquest with a special focus on the Achaemenid period. At the celebration at Persepolis in 1971, the Shah had an elaborate fireworks show put on together with a sound and light show transmitted by hundreds of hidden loudspeakers and projectors intended to send a dual message; that Iran was still faithful to its ancient traditions and that Iran had transcended its past to become a modern nation, that Iran was not \"stuck in the past\", but as a nation that embraced modernity had chosen to be faithful to its past. The message was further reinforced the next day when the \"Parade of Persian History\" was performed at Persepolis when 6,000 soldiers dressed in the uniforms of every dynasty from the Achaemenids to the Pahlavis marched past Mohammad Reza in a grand parade that many contemporaries remarked \"surpassed in sheer spectacle the most florid celluloid imaginations of Hollywood epics\". To complete the message, Mohammad Reza finished off the celebrations by opening a brand new museum in Tehran, the Shahyad Aryamehr, that was housed in a very modernistic building and attended another parade in the newly opened Aryamehr Stadium, intended to give a message of \"compressed time\" between antiquity and modernity. A brochure put up by the Celebration Committee explicitly stated the message: \"Only when change is extremely rapid, and the past ten years have proved to be so, does the past attain new and unsuspected values worth cultivating\", going on to say the celebrations were held because \"Iran has began to feel confident of its modernization\". Milani noted it was sign of the liberalization of the middle years of Mohammad Reza's reign that Hussein Amanat, the architect who designed the Shahyad was a young Baha'i from a middle-class family who did not belong to the \"thousand families\" that traditionally dominated Iran, writing that it only in this moment in Iranian history that this was possible.\n\nIn the 1970s, Iran had an economic growth rate equal to that of South Korea, Turkey and Taiwan, and Western journalists all regularly predicated that Iran would become a First World nation within the next generation. Significantly, a \"reverse brain drain\" had begun with Iranians who had been educated in the West returning home to take up positions in government and business. The firm of Iran National ran by the Khayami brothers had become by 1978 the largest automobile manufacturer in the Middle East producing 136,000 cars every year while employing 12,000 people in Meshed. One of the Khayami brothers complained if had not been for the revolution \"Iran National would be where the South Korean car industry is today\". Mohammad Reza had strong etatist tendencies and was deeply involved in the economy with his economic policies bearing a strong resemblance to the same etatist policies being pursued by General Park Chung-hee in South Korea at the same time. Mohammad Reza considered himself to be a socialist, saying he was \"more socialist and revolutionary than anyone\". Reflecting his self-proclaimed socialist tendencies, though unions were illegal, but the Shah brought in labour laws that were \"surprising fair to workers\". Iran in the 1960s and 70s was a tolerant place for the Jewish minority with one Iranian Jew, David Menasheri, remembering that Mohammad Reza's reign was the \"golden age\" for Iranian Jews when they were equals, and when the Iranian Jewish community was one of the wealthiest Jewish communities in the world. The Baha'i minority also did well after the bout of persecution in the mid-1950s ended with several Baha'i families becoming prominent in world of Iranian business.\n\nIn 1961, the Francophile Mohammad Reza visited Paris to meet his favourite leader, General Charles de Gaulle of France. Mohammad Reza saw height as the measure of a man and a woman (the Shah had a marked preference for tall women) and the 6'5 de Gaulle was his most admired leader. Mohammad Reza loved to be compared to his \"ego ideal\" of General de Gaulle, and his courtiers constantly flattered him by calling him Iran's de Gaulle. During the French trip, Queen Farah, who shared her husband's love of French culture and language, befriended the culture minister André Malraux, who arranged for the exchange of cultural artifacts between French and Iranian museums and art galleries, a policy that remained a key component of Iran's cultural diplomacy until 1979. Many of the legitimising devices of the regime such as the constant use of referendums were modelled after de Gaulle's regime. Intense Francophiles, Mohammad Reza and Farah preferred to speak French rather than Persian to their children. Mohammad Reza built the Niavaran Palace which took up 9, 000 square feet and whose style was a blend of Persian and French architecture.\n\nThe Shah's diplomatic foundation was the United States' guarantee that it would protect him, which was what enabled him to stand up to larger enemies. While the arrangement did not preclude other partnerships and treaties, it helped to provide a somewhat stable environment in which Mohammad Reza could implement his reforms. Another factor guiding Mohammad Reza in his foreign policy was his wish for financial stability which required strong diplomatic ties. A third factor in his foreign policy was his wish to present Iran as a prosperous and powerful nation; this fuelled his domestic policy of Westernisation and reform. A final component was his promise that communism could be halted at Iran's border if his monarchy was preserved. By 1977, the country's treasury, the Shah's autocracy, and his strategic alliances seemed to form a protective layer around Iran.\n\nAlthough the U.S. was responsible for putting the Shah in power, he did not always act as a close U.S. ally. In the early 1960s, when a policy planning staff that included William R. Polk encouraged the Shah to distribute Iran's growing revenues more equitably, slow the rush toward militarisation, and open the government to political processes, he became furious and identified Polk as \"the principal enemy of his regime.\" In July 1964, the Shah, Turkish President Cemal Gürsel and Pakistani President Ayub Khan announced in Istanbul the establishment of the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) organisation to promote joint transportation and economic projects. It also envisioned Afghanistan's joining at some time in the future. The Shah of Iran was the first regional leader to recognise the State of Israel as a de facto state, although when interviewed on \"60 Minutes\" by reporter Mike Wallace, he criticised American Jews for their presumed control over U.S. media and finance. In a 1967 memo to President Lyndon Johnson, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara wrote that \"our sales [to Iran] have created about 1.4 million man-years of employment in the U.S. and over $1 billion in profits to American industry over the last five years\", which led McNamara to conclude that Iran was an arms market the United States could not do without. In June 1965, after the Americans proved reluctant to sell Mohammad Reza some of the weapons he asked for, the Shah visited Moscow where the Soviets agreed to sell some $110 million worth of weaponry; the threat of Iran pursuing the \"Soviet option\" caused the Americans to give in on selling Iran weapons. Additionally, British, French and Italian arms firms were willing to sell Iran weapons, thus giving Mohammad Reza considerable leverage in his talks with the Americans, who sometimes worried that the Shah was buying more weapons than Iran needed or could handle.\n\nConcerning the fate of Bahrain (which Britain had controlled since the 19th century, but which Iran claimed as its own territory) and three small Persian Gulf islands, the Shah negotiated an agreement with the British, which, by means of a public consensus, ultimately led to the independence of Bahrain (against the wishes of Iranian nationalists). In return, Iran took full control of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa in the Strait of Hormuz, three strategically sensitive islands which were claimed by the United Arab Emirates. During this period, the Shah maintained cordial relations with the Persian Gulf states and established close diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia. Mohammad Reza saw Iran as the natural dominant power in the Persian Gulf region, and that no challenges to Iranian hegemony would be tolerated, a claim that was supported by a gargantuan arms-buying spree that started in the early 1960s. Mohammad Reza supported the Yemeni royalists against republican forces in the Yemen Civil War (1962–70) and assisted the sultan of Oman in putting down a rebellion in Dhofar (1971). In 1971, Mohammad Reza told a journalist: \"World events were such that we were compelled to accept the fact that sea adjoining the Oman Sea--I mean the Indian Ocean--does not recognise borders. As for Iran's security limits--I will not state how many kilometers we have in mind, but anyone who is acquainted with geography and the strategic situation, and especially with the potential air and sea forces, know what distances from Chah Bahar this limit can reach\".\n\nRelations with Iraq, however, were often difficult due to political instability in the latter country. Mohammad Reza was distrustful of both the Socialist government of Abd al-Karim Qasim and the Arab nationalist Baath party. Mohammad Reza resented the internationally recognised border on the Shatt al-Arab river, which in a 1937 treaty fixed the border on the low watermark on the Iranian side, giving Iraq control of most of the Shatt al-Arab. On 19 April 1969, Mohammad Reza abrogated the 1937 Iranian-Iraqi treaty over control of the Shatt al-Arab, and as a result Iran ceased paying tolls to Iraq when its ships used the Shatt al-Arab, costing Iraq a lucrative source of income. He justified his move by arguing that almost all river borders all over the world ran along the \"thalweg\" (deep channel mark), and by claiming that because most of the ships that used the Shatt al-Arab were Iranian, the 1937 treaty was unfair to Iran. Iraq threatened war over the Iranian move, but when on 24 April 1969 an Iranian tanker escorted by Iranian warships sailed down the Shatt al-Arab without paying tolls, Iraq, being the militarily weaker state, did nothing. The Iranian abrogation of the 1937 treaty marked the beginning of a period of acute Iraqi-Iranian tension that was to last until the Algiers Accords of 1975. The fact that Iraq had welcomed the former SAVAK chief General Teymur Bakhtiar to Baghdad where he regularly met with representatives of the Tudeh Party and the Confederation of Iranian Students added to the difficult relations between Iran and Iraq. On 7 August 1970, Bakhtiar was badly wounded by a SAVAK assassin who shot him five times, and he died five days later; Alam wrote in his diary that Mohammad Reza rejoiced at the news.\n\nOn 7 May 1972, Mohammad Reza told a visiting President Richard Nixon that the Soviet Union was attempting to dominate the Middle East via its close ally Iraq, and to check Iraqi ambitions would also be to check Soviet ambitions. Nixon agreed to support Iranian claims to have the \"thalweg\" in the Shatt al-Arab as the border and to generally back Iran in its confrontation with Iraq. Mohammad Reza financed Kurdish separatist rebels in Iraq, and to cover his tracks, armed them with Soviet weapons which Israel had seized from Soviet-backed Arab regimes, and then handed over to Iran at the Shah's behest. The initial operation was a disaster, but the Shah continued attempts to support the rebels and weaken Iraq. Then in 1975, the countries signed the Algiers Accord, which granted Iran equal navigation rights in the Shatt al-Arab river as the \"thalweg\" was now the new border, while Mohammad Reza agreed to end his support for Iraqi Kurdish rebels. The Shah also maintained close relations with King Hussein of Jordan, Anwar Sadat of Egypt, and King Hassan II of Morocco. Starting in 1970, Mohammad Reza formed an unlikely alliance with the militantly left-wing regime of Colonel Qaddhafi of Libya as both leaders wanted higher oil prices for their nations, leading to Iran and Libya joining forces to press for the \"leapfrogging\" of oil prices.\n\nThe U.S.-Iran relationship grew more contentious as the U.S. became more dependent on Reza to be a stabilising force in the Middle East. In a July 1969 visit to Guam, President Richard Nixon had announced the Nixon Doctrine, which declared that the United States would honour its treaty commitments in Asia, but \"as far as the problems of international security are concerned ... the United States is going to encourage and has a right to expect that this problem will increasingly be handled by, and the responsibility for it taken by, the Asian nations themselves\". The particular Asian nation the Nixon Doctrine was aimed at was South Vietnam, but Mohamed Reza seized upon the Nixon Doctrine with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for their own defence to argue that the Americans should sell him arms without limitation, a suggestion that Nixon embraced. A particular dynamic was established in American-Iranian relations from 1969 onward in which the Americans gave in to whatever Mohammad Reza demanded, as they felt they needed a strong Iran as a pro-American force in the Middle East and could not afford to lose Iran as an ally. Further adding to the Shah's confidence was the Sino-Soviet war of 1969, which forced the Red Army to make a major redeployment to the Chinese border. Mohammad Reza, who always feared the prospect of a Soviet invasion, welcomed the Sino-Soviet war and the resulting reduction of Red Army divisions along the Soviet-Iranian border as giving him more room internationally.\n\nUnder Nixon, the United States finally agreed to sever all contact with any Iranians opposed to the Shah's regime, a concession that Mohammad Reza had been seeking since 1958. The often very anti-American tone of the Iranian press was ignored because Mohammad Reza supported the United States in the Vietnam War and likewise the Americans ignored the Shah's efforts to raise oil prices, despite the fact it cost many American consumers more. After 1969, a process of \"reverse leverage\" set in when Mohammad Reza began to dictate to the United States as the Americans needed him more than he needed the Americans. The American National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger wrote because of the Vietnam War, it was not politically possible in the 1970s for the United States to fight a major war, writing in 1982: \"There was no possibility of assigning any American forces to the Indian Ocean in the midst of the Vietnam War and its attendant trauma. Congress would have tolerated no such commitment; the public would not have supported it. Fortunately, Iran was willing to play this role\". As such, the Americans needed Iran as an ally very badly, which allowed Mohammad Reza to dictate to them, an experience that greatly boosted his ego, as he felt he was able to impose his will on the world's most powerful nation.\n\nThe Americans initially rejected Mohammad Reza's suggestion that they join him in supporting the Iraqi Kurdish \"peshmerga\" fighting for independence on the grounds that an independent Kurdistan would inspire the Turkish Kurds to rebel, and they had no interest in antagonising the NATO member Turkey. Some of the Shah's advisers also felt it was unwise to support the \"peshmerga\", saying that if the Iraqi Kurds won independence, then the Iranian Kurds would want to join them. When Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran in May 1972, the Shah convinced them to take a larger role in what had, up to then, been a mainly Israeli-Iranian operation to aid Iraqi Kurds in their struggles against Iraq, against the warnings of the CIA and State Department that the Shah would ultimately betray the Kurds. He did this in March 1975 with the signing of the Algiers Accord that settled Iraqi-Iranian border disputes, an action taken without prior consultation with the U.S., after which he cut off all aid to the Kurds and prevented the U.S. and Israel from using Iranian territory to provide them assistance. As way of increasing pressure on Baghdad, the \"peshmerga\" had been encouraged by Iran and the U.S. to abandon guerrilla war for conventional war in April 1974, so the years 1974-75 saw the heaviest fighting between the Iraqi Army and the \"peshmerga\". The sudden cut-off of Iranian support in March 1975 left the Kurds very exposed, causing them to be crushed by Iraq. The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote that \"...the Iraqis celebrated their victory in the usual manner, by executing as many of the rebels as they could lay their hands on\". Kissinger later wrote in his memoirs that it was never the intention of the U.S. or Iran to see the \"peshmerga\" actually win, as an independent Kurdistan would have created too many problems for both Turkey and Iran; rather the intention was to \"irritate\" Iraq enough to force the Iraqis to change their foreign policy.\n\nThe Shah also manipulated America's dependence on Middle Eastern oil; although Iran did not participate in the 1973 oil embargo, he purposely increased production in its aftermath to capitalise on the higher prices. In December 1973, only two months after oil prices were raised by 70 per cent, he urged OPEC nations to push prices even higher, which they agreed to and more than doubled the price. Oil prices increased 470 per cent over a 12-month period, which also increased Iran's GDP by 50 per cent. Despite personal pleas from President Richard Nixon, the Shah ignored any complaints, claimed the U.S. was importing more oil than any time in the past, and proclaimed that \"the industrial world will have to realise that the era of their terrific progress and even more terrific income and wealth based on cheap oil is finished.\"\n\nWith Iran's great oil wealth, the Shah became the preeminent leader of the Middle East, and self-styled \"Guardian\" of the Persian Gulf. In 1961 he defended his style of rule, saying \"When Iranians learn to behave like Swedes, I will behave like the King of Sweden.\"\n\nDuring the last years of his regime, the Shah's government became more autocratic. In the words of a U.S. Embassy dispatch, \"The Shah's picture is everywhere. The beginning of all film showings in public theaters presents the Shah in various regal poses accompanied by the strains of the National Anthem ... The monarch also actively extends his influence to all phases of social affairs ... there is hardly any activity or vocation in which the Shah or members of his family or his closest friends do not have a direct or at least a symbolic involvement. In the past, he had claimed to take a two-party system seriously and declared, 'If I were a dictator rather than a constitutional monarch, then I might be tempted to sponsor a single dominant party such as Hitler organised'\".\nHowever, by 1975 he had abolished the two-party system of government in favour of a one-party state under the Rastakhiz (\"Resurrection\") Party. This was the merger of the New Iran Party, a centre-right party, and the People's Party, a liberal party. The Shah justified his actions by declaring: \"We must straighten out Iranians' ranks. To do so, we divide them into two categories: those who believe in Monarchy, the constitution and the Six Bahman Revolution and those who don't ... A person who does not enter the new political party and does not believe in the three cardinal principles will have only two choices. He is either an individual who belongs to an illegal organisation, or is related to the outlawed Tudeh Party, or in other words a traitor. Such an individual belongs to an Iranian prison, or if he desires he can leave the country tomorrow, without even paying exit fees; he can go anywhere he likes, because he is not Iranian, he has no nation, and his activities are illegal and punishable according to the law\". In addition, the Shah had decreed that all Iranian citizens and the few remaining political parties become part of Rastakhiz.\n\nBy the 1970s, Mohammad Reza was considered one of the world's most successful and able leaders. From 1973 onward, Mohammad Reza had proclaimed his aim as that of the \"tamaddon-e-bozorg\", the \"Great Civilisation\", a turning point not only in Iran's history, but also the history of the entire world, a claim that was taken seriously for a time in the West. On 2 December 1974, the \"New Yorker\" magazine published an article by Paul Erdman that was a conjectural future history entitled \"The Oil War of 1976: How The Shah Won the World: The World as We Knew It Came to an End When the Shah Of Iran Decided to Restore The Glory of Ancient Persia with Western Arms\". In 1975, the Vice President of the United States Nelson Rockefeller declared in a speech: \"We must take His Imperial Majesty to the United States for a couple of years so that he can teach us how to run a country\". In 1976 a pulp novel by Alan Williams was published in the United States under the title \"A Bullet for the Shah: All They Had To Do Was Kill the World's Most Powerful Man\", whose sub-title reveals much about how the American people viewed the Shah at the time (the original British title was the more prosaic \"Shah-Mak\").\n\nThe great wealth generated by Iran's oil encouraged a sense of nationalism at the Imperial Court. The Empress Farah recalled of her days as a university student in 1950s France about being asked where she was from: When I told them Iran ... the Europeans would recoil in horror as if Iranians were barbarians and loathsome. But after Iran became wealthy under the Shah in the 1970s, Iranians were courted everywhere. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, Your Majesty. If you please, Your Majesty. Fawning all over us. Greedy sycophants. Then they loved Iranians. Mohammad Reza shared the Empress's sentiments as Westerners came begging to his court looking for his largess, leading him to remark in 1976:\nNow we are the masters and our former masters are our slaves. Everyday they a beat a track to our door begging for favors. How can they be of assistance? Do we want arms? Do we want nuclear power stations? We have only to answer, and they will fulfill our wishes Because the House of Pahlavi were a parvenu house as Reza Khan had begun his career as a private in the Persian Army, rising up to the rank of general, taking power in a coup d'état in 1921, and making himself Shah in 1925, Mohammad Reza was keen to gain the approval of the older royal families of the world, and was prepared to spend large sums of money to gain that social acceptance.\n\nAmongst the royalty that came to Tehran looking for generosity from a Shah known for his lavish spending were King Hussein of Jordan, the former King Constantine II of Greece, King Hassan II of Morocco, the princes and princesses of the Dutch House of Orange and the Italian Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy, whom the Shah had once courted in the 1950s. He coveted the British Order of the Garter, and had, prior to courting Maria Gabriella, inquired about marrying Princess Alexandra of Kent, granddaughter of King George V, but in both cases he was rebuffed in no uncertain terms. As an Iranian, Mohammad Reza greatly enjoyed supporting the Greek branch of the House of Glücksburg, knowing the Greeks still celebrated their victories over the Persians in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. He enjoyed close relations with Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, as demonstrated by the fact that he was the guest of honour at the Persepolis celebrations in 1971. Ethiopia and Iran, along with Turkey and Israel, were envisioned as an \"alliance of the periphery\" that would constrain Arab power in the greater Middle East.\n\nIn an era of high oil prices, Iran's economy boomed while the economies of the Western nations after the oil shock of 1973–74 were trapped in stagflation (economic stagnation and inflation), which seemed to prove the greatness of Mohammad Reza both to himself and to the rest of the world. In 1975, both the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and the French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing made pleading phone calls to Mohammad Reza, asking him for loans, which ultimately led the Shah to give a $1 billion US loan to the United Kingdom and another $1 billion US to France. In a TV speech in January 1975 explaining why he was lending Britain a sum equal to $1 billion US dollars, Mohammad Reza declared in his usual grandiose style: \"I have known the most dark hours when our country was obliged to pass under the tutelage of foreign powers, amongst them England. Now I find that England has not only become our friend, our equal, but also the nation to which, should we be able, we will render assistance with pleasure\", going on to say that since he \"belonged to this [European] world\", he did not want Europe to collapse economically. As Britain had often dominated Iran in the past, the change in roles was greatly gratifying to Mohammad Reza.\n\nThe courtiers of the Shah's court were devoted to stroking his ego, competing about who could be the most sycophantic, with Mohammad Reza being regularly assured he was a greater leader than his much admired General de Gaulle, that democracy was doomed, and based on Rockefeller's speech that the American people wanted Mohammad Reza to be their leader, as well as doing such a great job as Shah of Iran. All of this praise boosted Mohammad Reza's ego, and he went from being a merely narcissistic man to a megalomaniac, believing himself a man chosen by Allah Himself to transform Iran and create the \"Great Civilisation\". When one of the Shah's courtiers suggested launching a campaign to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, he wrote on the margin: \"If they beg us, we might accept. They give the Nobel to \"kaka siah\" [\"any black face\"] these days. Why should we belittle ourselves with this?\" Befitting all this attention and praise, Mohammad Reza started to make increasingly outlandish claims for the \"Great Civilisation\", telling the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci in a 1973 interview: Halfway measures, compromises, are unfeasible. In other words, either one is a revolutionary or one demands law and order. One can't be a revolutionary with law and order. And even less with tolerance ... when Castro came to power, he killed at least 10, 000 people ... in a sense, he was really capable, because he's still in power. So am I, however! And I intend to stay there, and to demonstrate that one can achieve a great many things by the use of force, show even that your old socialism is finished. Old, obsolete, finished ... I achieve more than the Swedes ... Huh! Swedish socialism! It didn't even nationalize forests and water. But I have ... my White Revolution ... is a new original kind of socialism and ... believe me, in Iran we're far more advanced than you and we really have nothing to learn from you. In an interview with \"Der Spiegel\" published on 3 February 1974, Mohammad Reza declared: \"I would like you to know that in our case, our actions are not just to take vengeance on the West. As I said, we are going to be a member of your club\". In a press conference on March 31, 1974, Mohammad Reza predicted what Iran would be like in 1984, saying: In the cities, electric cars would replace the gas engines and mass transportation systems would be switched to electricity, monorail over the ground or electric buses. And, furthermore, in the great era of civilization that lies ahead of our people, there will be least two or three holidays a week. In 1976, Mohammad Reza told the Egyptian journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal in an interview: \"I want the standard of living in Iran in ten years' time to be exactly on a level with that in Europe today. In twenty years' time we shall be ahead of the United States\".\n\nReflecting his need to have Iran seen as \"part of the world\" (by which Mohammad Reza meant the western world), all through the 1970s he sponsored conferences in Iran at his expense, with for example in one week in September 1975 the International Literacy Symposium meeting in Persepolis, the International Congress of Philosophy meeting in Mashhad and the International Congress of Mithraic Studies meeting in Tehran. He also sought to hold the 1984 Summer Olympics in Tehran. For most ordinary Iranians, struggling with inflation, poverty, air pollution (Iranian cities were infamous in the 1970s as being amongst the most polluted in the world), having to pay extortion payments to the police who demanded money from even those performing legal jobs such as selling fruits on the street, and daily traffic jams, the Shah's sponsorship of international conferences were just a waste of money and time. Furthermore, conferences on pre-Islamic practices such as the cult of Mithra fuelled religious anxieties. Though Mohammad Reza envisioned the \"Great Civilisation\" of a modernised Iran whose standard of living would be higher than those of the United States and at the forefront of modern technology, he did not envision any political change, making it clear that Iran would remain an autocracy.\n\nIn his \"White Revolution\" starting in the 1960s, Mohammad Reza made major changes to modernise Iran. He curbed the power of certain ancient elite factions by expropriating large and medium-sized estates for the benefit of more than four million small farmers. He took a number of other major measures, including extending suffrage to women and the participation of workers in factories through shares and other measures. In the 1970s the governmental programme of free-of-charge nourishment for children at school known as \"Taghziye Rāyegan\" (Persian: تغذیه رایگان) was implemented. Under the Shah's reign, the national Iranian income showed an unprecedented rise for an extended period.\nImprovement of the educational system was made through the creation of new elementary schools. In addition, literacy courses were set up in remote villages by the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces, this initiative being called \"Sepāh-e Dānesh\" (Persian: سپاه دانش) meaning \"Army of Knowledge\". The Armed Forces were also engaged in infrastructural and other educational projects throughout the country \"Sepāh-e Tarvij va Ābādāni\" (Persian: سپاه ترویج و آبادانی) as well as in health education and promotion \"Sepāh-e Behdāsht\" (Persian: سپاه بهداشت). The Shah instituted exams for Islamic theologians to become established clerics. Many Iranian university students were sent to and supported in foreign, especially Western, countries and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1977 the number of universities increased in number from 7 to 22, the number of institutions of advanced learning rose from 47 to 200, and the number of students in higher education soared from 36,742 to 100,000. Iran’s literacy programs were among the most innovative and effective anywhere in the world, so that by 1977 the number of Iranians able to read and write had climbed from just 17 percent to more than 50 percent.\n\nIn the field of diplomacy, Iran realised and maintained friendly relations with Western and East European countries as well as the state of Israel and China and became, especially through its close friendship with the United States, more and more a hegemonial power in the Persian Gulf region and the Middle East. The suppression of the communist guerrilla movement in the region of Dhofar in Oman with the help of the Iranian army after a formal request by Sultan Qaboos was widely regarded in this context.\n\nAs to infrastructural and technological progress, the Shah continued and developed further the policies introduced by his father. His programmes included projects in technologies such as steel, telecommunications, petrochemical facilities, power plants, dams and the automobile industry. The Aryamehr University of Technology was established as a major new academic institution.\n\nInternational cultural cooperation was encouraged and organised, such as the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire and Shiraz Arts Festival. As part of his various financial support programmes in the fields of culture and arts, the Shah, along with King Hussein of Jordan made a donation to the Chinese Muslim Association for the construction of the Taipei Grand Mosque.\n\nThe overthrow of the Shah came as a surprise to almost all observers. The first militant anti-Shah demonstrations of a few hundred started in October 1977, after the death of Khomeini's son Mostafa. On 7 January 1978, an article \"Iran and Red and Black Colonization\" was published in the newspaper \"Ettela'at\" attacking Ruhollah Khomeini, who was in exile in Iraq at the time; it referred to him as a homosexual, a drug addict, a British spy and claimed he was an Indian, not an Iranian. Khomeini's supporters had brought in audio tapes of his sermons, and Mohammad Reza was angry with one sermon, alleging corruption on his part, and decided to hit back with the article, despite the feeling at the court, SAVAK and \"Ettela'at\" editors that the article was an unnecessary provocation that was going to cause trouble. The next day, protests against the article began in the holy city of Qom, a traditional centre of opposition to the House of Pahlavi.\n\nMohammad Reza was diagnosed with cancer in 1974. As it worsened, from the spring of 1978, Mohammad Reza stopped appearing in public, with the official explanation being that he was suffering from a \"persistent cold\". In May 1978, Mohammad Reza suddenly cancelled a long planned trip to Hungary and Bulgaria and disappeared from view. Mohammad Reza spent the entire summer of 1978 at his resort on the Caspian Sea, where he was treated for his cancer by two of France's most prominent doctors, Jean Bernard and Georges Flandrin. To try to stop his cancer, Bernard and Flandrin had Mohammad Reza take prednisone, an anti-cancer drug that causes depression and impairs thinking. As the country was swept up with nationwide protests and strikes, the court found it impossible to get decisions from Mohammad Reza, as he became utterly passive and indecisive, content to spend hours listlessly staring into space as he rested by the Caspian Sea while the revolution raged. The seclusion of the Shah who normally loved the limelight sparked all sorts of rumors all over Iran about the state of his health and damaged the imperial mystique, as the man who had been presented as a god-like ruler was revealed to be fallible after all. An attempt in July 1978 to deny the rumors of Mohammad Reza's declining health by publishing a crudely doctored photograph in the newspapers of the Emperor and Empress walking on the beach on the Caspian Sea instead further damaged the imperial mystique, as most people realised that what appeared to be two beach clogs on either side of the Shah were merely substitutes inserted for his airbrushed aides, who were holding him up as he now had difficulty walking by himself. In June 1978, Mohammad Reza's French doctors first revealed to the French government how serious his cancer was, and in September 1978 the French government informed the American government that the Shah was dying of cancer; U.S. officials until then had no idea that Mohammad Reza had been diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1974. Mohammad Reza had created a very centralised system in which he was the key decision-maker on all issues, and as the Iranian-American historian Abbas Milani noted, the Shah was mentally crippled in the summer of 1978 owing to his tendency to be indecisive when faced with a crisis, which combined with his cancer and the effects of the anti-cancer drugs made his mood \"... increasingly volatile and unpredictable. One day, he was full of verve and optimism and the next day or hour he fell into a catatonic stupor\", bringing the entire government to a halt. Milani wrote that the Shah was in 1978 \"beset with depression, indecision and paralysis, and his indecision led to the immobilisation of the entire system\". The Empress Farah grew so frustrated with her husband that she suggested numerous times that he leave Iran for medical treatment and appoint her regent, saying she would handle the crisis and save the House of Pahlavi, an idea that the macho Mohammad Reza vetoed, saying he did not want Farah to be \"Joan of Arc\" and it would be too humiliating for him as a man to flee Iran and leave a woman in charge.\n\nThe Shah-centred command structure of the Iranian military, and the lack of training to confront civil unrest, was marked by disaster and bloodshed. There were several instances where army units had opened fire, the most notorious one being the events of 8 September 1978. On this day, which later became known as \"Black Friday\", thousands had gathered in Tehran's Jaleh Square for a religious demonstration. With people refusing to recognise martial law, the soldiers opened fire, killing and seriously injuring a large number of people. Black Friday played a crucial role in further radicalising the protest movement. The massacre so reduced the chance for reconciliation that Black Friday is referred to as \"the point of no return\" for the revolution. On 2 October 1978, the Shah declared and granted an amnesty to dissidents living abroad, including Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nBy October 1978, strikes were paralysing the country, and in early December a \"total of 6 to 9 million\"—more than 10% of the country—marched against the Shah throughout Iran. In October 1978, after flying over a huge demonstration in Tehran in his helicopter, Mohammad Reza accused the British ambassador Sir Anthony Parsons and the American ambassador William H. Sullivan of organising the demonstrations, screaming that he was being \"betrayed\" by the United Kingdom and the United States. The fact that the BBC's journalists tended to be very sympathetic towards the revolution was viewed by most Iranians, including Mohammad Reza, as a sign that Britain was supporting the revolution. This impression turned out to be crucial, as the Iranian people had a very exaggerated idea about Britain's capacity to \"direct events\" in Iran. In a subsequent internal inquiry, the BBC found many of its more left-wing journalists disliked Mohammad Reza as a \"reactionary\" force, and sympathised with a revolution seen as \"progressive\". Mohammad Reza spent much of his time working out various conspiracy theories about who was behind the revolution, with his favourite candidates being some combination of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. Milani wrote that Mohamad Reza's view of the revolution as a gigantic conspiracy organised by foreign powers suggested that there was nothing wrong with Iran, and the millions of people demonstrating against him were just dupes being used by foreigners, a viewpoint that did not encourage concessions and reforms until it was too late. For much of 1978, Mohammad Reza saw his enemies as \"Marxist\" revolutionaries rather than Islamists. The Shah had exaggerated ideas about the power of the KGB, which he thought of as omnipotent, and often expressed the view that all of the demonstrations against him had been organised in Moscow, saying only the KGB had the power to bring out thousands of ordinary people to demonstrate. In October 1978, the oil workers went on strike, shutting down the oil industry and with it, Mohammad Reza's principal source of revenue. The Iranian military had no plans in place to deal with such an event, and the strike pushed the regime to the economic brink.\n\nThe revolution had attracted support from a broad coalition ranging from secular, left-wing nationalists to Islamists on the right, and Khomeini, who was now based in Paris after being expelled from Iraq, chose to present himself as a moderate able to bring together all the different factions leading the revolution. On 3 November a SAVAK plan to arrest about 1,500 people considered to be leaders of the revolution was submitted to Mohammad Reza, who at first tentatively agreed, but then changed his mind, disregarding not the only plan, but also dismissing its author, Parviz Sabeti. On 5 November 1978, Mohammad Reza went on Iranian television to say \"I have heard the voice of your revolution\" and promise major reforms. In a major concession to the opposition, on 7 November 1978, Mohammad Reza freed all political prisoners while ordering the arrest of the former prime minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda and several senior officials of his regime, a move that both emboldened his opponents and demoralised his supporters. On 21 November 1978, the Treasury Secretary of the United States Michael Blumenthal visited Tehran to meet Mohammad Reza and reported back to President Carter, \"This man is a ghost\", as by now the ravages of his cancer could not longer be concealed. In late December 1978, the Shah learned that many of his generals were making overtures to the revolutionary leaders and the loyalty of the military could not longer be counted upon. In a sign of desperation, the following month Mohammad Reza reached out to the National Front, asking if one of their leaders would be willing to become prime minister.\n\nThe Shah was especially interested in having the National Front's Gholam Hossein Sadighi as prime minister. Sadighi had served as interior minister under Mosaddegh, had been imprisoned after the 1953 coup, and had pardoned by Mohammad Reza on the grounds that he was a \"patriot\". Sadighi remained active in the National Front and had often been harassed by SAVAK, but was willing to serve as prime minister under Mohammad Reza in order to \"save\" Iran, saying he feared what might come after if the Shah was overthrown. Despite the opposition of the other National Front leaders, Sadighi visited the Niavaran palace several times in December 1978 to discuss the terms under which he might become prime minister, with the main sticking point being that he wanted the Shah not to leave Iran, saying he needed to remain in order to ensure the loyalty of the military. On 7 December 1978, it was announced that President Carter of the U.S., President Giscard d'Estaing of France, Chancellor Schmidt of West Germany and Prime Minister Callaghan of the United Kingdom would meet in Guadeloupe on 5 January 1979 to discuss the crisis in Iran. For Mohammad Reza this announcement was the final blow, and he was convinced that the Western leaders were holding the meeting to discuss how best to abandon him.\n\nOn 16 January 1979, Mohammad Reza made a contract with Farboud and left Iran at the behest of Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar (a longtime opposition leader himself), who sought to calm the situation. As Mohammad Reza boarded the plane to take him out of Iran, many of the Imperial Guardsmen wept while Bakhtiar did little to hide his disdain and dislike for the Shah. Spontaneous attacks by members of the public on statues of the Pahlavis followed, and \"within hours, almost every sign of the Pahlavi dynasty\" was destroyed. Bakhtiar dissolved SAVAK, freed all political prisoners, and allowed Ayatollah Khomeini to return to Iran after years in exile. He asked Khomeini to create a Vatican-like state in Qom, promised free elections, and called upon the opposition to help preserve the constitution, proposing a \"national unity\" government including Khomeini's followers. Khomeini rejected Bakhtiar's demands and appointed his own interim government, with Mehdi Bazargan as prime minister, stating that \"I will appoint a state. I will act against this government. With the nation's support, I will appoint a state.\" In February, pro-Khomeini revolutionary guerrilla and rebel soldiers gained the upper hand in street fighting, and the military announced its neutrality. On the evening of 11 February, the dissolution of the monarchy was complete.\n\nAt the Federation of American Scientists, John Pike writes:\n\nExplanations for the overthrow of Mohammad Reza include his status as a dictator put in place by a non-Muslim Western power, the United States, whose foreign culture was seen as influencing that of Iran. Additional contributing factors included reports of oppression, brutality, corruption, and extravagance. Basic functional failures of the regime have also been blamed – economic bottlenecks, shortages and inflation; the regime's over-ambitious economic programme; the failure of its security forces to deal with protests and demonstrations; and the overly centralised royal power structure.\nInternational policies pursued by the Shah in order to increase national income by remarkable increases in the price of oil through his leading role in the Organization of the Oil Producing Countries (OPEC) have been stressed as a major cause for a shift of Western interests and priorities, and for a reduction of their support for him reflected in a critical position of Western politicians and media, especially of the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter regarding the question of human rights in Iran, and in strengthened economic ties between the United States of America and Saudi Arabia in the 1970s.\nIn October 1971, Mohammad Reza celebrated the twenty-five-hundredth anniversary of the Iranian monarchy; The \"New York Times\" reported that $100 million was spent on the celebration. Next to the ancient ruins of Persepolis, the Shah gave orders to build a tent city covering , studded with three huge royal tents and fifty-nine lesser ones arranged in a star-shaped design. French chefs from Maxim's of Paris prepared breast of peacock for royalty and dignitaries from around the world, the buildings were decorated by Maison Jansen (the same firm that helped Jacqueline Kennedy redecorate the White House), the guests ate off Limoges porcelain and drank from Baccarat crystal glasses. This became a major scandal, as the contrast between the dazzling elegance of the celebration and the misery of the nearby villages was so dramatic that no one could ignore it. Months before the festivities, university students went on strike in protest. Indeed, the cost was so sufficiently impressive that the Shah forbade his associates to discuss the actual figures. However he and his supporters argued that the celebrations opened new investments in Iran, improved relationships with the other leaders and nations of the world, and provided greater recognition of Iran.\nOther actions that are thought to have contributed to his downfall include antagonising formerly apolitical Iranians — especially merchants of the bazaars — with the creation in 1975 of a single party political monopoly (the \"Rastakhiz\" Party), with compulsory membership and dues, and general aggressive interference in the political, economic, and religious concerns of people's lives; and the 1976 change from an Islamic calendar to an Imperial calendar, marking the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus as the first day, instead of the migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina. This supposed date was designed so that the year 2500 would fall on 1941, the year when his own reign started. Overnight, the year changed from 1355 to 2535. During the extravagant festivities to celebrate the 2500th anniversary, the Shah was quoted as saying at Cyrus's tomb: \"Rest in peace, Cyrus, for we are awake\".\n\nIt has been argued that the White Revolution was \"shoddily planned and haphazardly carried out\", upsetting the wealthy while not going far enough to provide for the poor or offer greater political freedom. In 1974, Mohammad Reza learned from his French doctors that he was suffering from the cancer that was to kill him six years later. Though this was such a carefully guarded secret that not even the Americans were aware of it (as late as 1977 the CIA submitted a report to President Carter describing the Shah as being in \"robust health\"), the knowledge of his impending death left Mohammad Reza depressed and passive in his last years, a man no longer capable of acting.\n\nSome achievements of the Shah—such as broadened education—had unintended consequences. While school attendance rose (by 1966 the school attendance of urban seven- to fourteen-year-olds was estimated at 75.8%), Iran's labour market could not absorb a high number of educated youth. In 1966, high school graduates had \"a higher rate of unemployment than did the illiterate\", and the educated unemployed often supported the revolution.\n\nDuring his second exile, Mohammad Reza travelled from country to country seeking what he hoped would be temporary residence. First he flew to Aswan, Egypt, where he received a warm and gracious welcome from President Anwar El-Sadat. He later lived in Marrakesh, Morocco as a guest of King Hassan II. Mohammad Reza loved to support royalty during his time as Shah and one of those who benefitted had been Hassan, who received an interest-free loan of $110 million US dollars from his friend. Mohammad Reza expected Hassan to return the favour, but he soon learned Hassan had other motives. Richard Parker, the American ambassador to Morocco reported \"The Moroccans believed the Shah was worth about $2 billion, and they wanted to take their share of the loot\". After leaving Morocco, Mohammad Reza lived in Paradise Island, in the Bahamas, and in Cuernavaca, Mexico, near Mexico City, as a guest of José López Portillo. Richard Nixon, the former president, visited the Shah in summer 1979 in Mexico. An American doctor, Benjamin Kean who examined Mohammad Reza in Cuernavaca later wrote:There was no longer any doubt. The atmosphere had changed completely. The Shah's appearance was stunningly worse ... Clearly he had obstructive jaundice. The odds favored gallstones, since his fever, chills and abdominal distress suggested an infection of the biliary tract. Also he had a history of indigestion. Besides the probable obstruction – he now had been deeply jaundiced for six to eight weeks – he was emaciated and suffering from hard tumor nodes in the neck and a swollen spleen, signs that his cancer was worsening, and he had severe anemia and very low white blood counts. The Shah suffered from gallstones that would require prompt surgery. He was offered treatment in Switzerland, but insisted on treatment in the United States. President Carter did not wish to admit Mohammad Reza to the U.S. but came under pressure from many quarters, with Henry Kissinger phoning Carter to say he would not endorse the SALT II treaty that Carter had just signed with the Soviet Union unless the former Shah was allowed into the United States, reportedly prompting Carter more than once to hang up his phone in rage in the Oval Office and shout \"Fuck the Shah!\". As many Republicans were attacking the SALT II treaty as an American give-away to the Soviet Union, Carter was anxious to have the endorsement of a Republican elder statesman like Kissinger to fend off this criticism. Mohammad Reza had decided not to tell his Mexican doctors he had cancer, and the Mexican doctors had misdiagnosed his illness as malaria, giving him a regime of anti-malarial drugs that did nothing to treat his cancer, which caused his health to go into rapid decline as he lost 30 pounds. In September 1979, a doctor sent by David Rockefeller reported to the State Department that Mohammad Reza needed to come to the United States for medical treatment, an assessment not shared by Kean, who stated that the proper medical equipment for treating Mohammad Reza's cancer could be found in Mexico and the only problem was the former Shah's unwillingness to tell the Mexicans he had cancer. The State Department warned Carter not to admit the former Shah into the U.S., saying it was likely that the Iranian regime would seize the American embassy in Tehran if that occurred. Milani suggested there was a possible conflict of interest on the part of Rockefeller, noting that his Chase Manhattan Bank had given Iran a $500 million loan under questionable conditions in 1978 (several lawyers had refused to endorse the loan) which placed the money in an account with Chase Manhattan, that the new Islamic republic had been making \"substantial withdrawals\" from its account with Chase Manhattan, and that Rockefeller wanted Mohammad Reza in the US, knowing full well it was likely to cause the Iranians to storm the U.S. embassy, which in turn would cause the U.S. government to freeze Iranian financial assets in America---such as the Iranian account at Chase Manhattan.\nOn 22 October 1979, President Jimmy Carter reluctantly allowed the Shah into the United States to undergo surgical treatment at the New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center. While there, Mohammad Reza used the name of \"David D. Newsom\", Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs at that time, as his temporary code name, without Newsom's knowledge. The Shah was taken later by US Air Force jet to Kelly Air Force Base in Texas and from there to Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base. It was anticipated that his stay in the United States would be short; however, surgical complications ensued, which required six weeks of confinement in the hospital before he recovered. His prolonged stay in the United States was extremely unpopular with the revolutionary movement in Iran, which still resented the United States' overthrow of Prime Minister Mosaddegh and the years of support for the Shah's rule. The Iranian government demanded his return to Iran, but he stayed in the hospital. Mohammad Reza's time in New York was highly uncomfortable; he was under a heavy security detail as every day, Iranian students studying in the United States gathered outside his hospital to shout \"Death to the Shah!\", a chorus that Mohammad Reza heard. The former Shah was obsessed with watching news from Iran, and was greatly upset at the new order being imposed by the Islamic Republic. Mohammad Reza could no longer walk by this time, and for security reasons had to be moved in his wheelchair under the cover of darkness when he went to the hospital while covered in a blanket, as the chances of his assassination were too great.\n\nThere are claims that Reza's admission to the United States resulted in the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the kidnapping of American diplomats, military personnel, and intelligence officers, which soon became known as the Iran hostage crisis. In the Shah's memoir, \"Answer to History\", he claimed that the United States never provided him any kind of health care and asked him to leave the country. From the time of the storming of the American embassy in Tehran and the taking of the embassy staff as hostages, Mohammad Reza's presence in the United States was viewed by the Carter administration as a stumbling block to the release of the hostages, and as Zonis noted \"... he was, in effect, expelled from the country\". Mohammad Reza wanted to go back to Mexico, saying he had pleasant memories of Cuernavaca, but was refused. Mexico was a candidate to be a rotating member of the UN Security Council, but needed the vote of Cuba to be admitted, and the Cuban leader Fidel Castro told President José López Portillo that Cuba's vote was conditional on Mexico not accepting the Shah again.\n\nHe left the United States on 15 December 1979 and lived for a short time in the Isla Contadora in Panama. This caused riots by Panamanians who objected to the Shah being in their country. General Omar Torrijos, the dictator of Panama kept Mohammad Reza as a virtual prisoner at the Paitilla Medical Center, a hospital condemned by the former Shah's American doctors as \"an inadequate and poorly staffed hospital\", and in order to hasten his death allowed only Panamanian doctors to treat his cancer. General Torrijos, a populist left-winger had only taken in Mohammad Reza under heavy American pressure, and he made no secret of his dislike of Mohammad Reza, whom he called after meeting him \"the saddest man he had ever met\". When he first met Mohammad Reza, Torrijos taunted him by telling him \"it must be hard to fall off the Peacock Throne into Contadora\" and called him a \"chupon\", a Spanish term meaning an \"orange\" that has all the juice squeezed out of it, which is slang for someone who is finished.\n\nTorrijos added to Mohammad Reza's misery by making his chief bodyguard a militantly Marxist sociology professor who spent much time lecturing Mohammad Reza on how he deserved his fate because he been a tool of the \"American imperialism\" that was oppressing the Third World, and charged Mohammad Reza a monthly rent of $21,000 US dollars, making him pay for all his food and the wages of the 200 National Guardsmen assigned as his bodyguards. The new government in Iran still demanded his and his wife's immediate extradition to Tehran. A short time after Mohammad Reza's arrival in Panama, an Iranian ambassador was dispatched to the Central American nation carrying a 450-page extradition request. That official appeal alarmed both the Shah and his advisors. Whether the Panamanian government would have complied is a matter of speculation amongst historians.\n\nThe only consolation for Mohammad Reza during his time in Panama were letters from Princess Soraya saying that she still loved him and wanted to see him one last time before he died. Mohammad Reza in the letters he sent to Paris declared he wanted to see Soraya one last time as well, but said that the Empress Farah could not be present, which presented some complications as Farah was continually by his deathbed.\n\nAfter that event, the Shah again sought the support of Egyptian president Anwar El-Sadat, who renewed his offer of permanent asylum in Egypt to the ailing monarch. He returned to Egypt in March 1980, where he received urgent medical treatment, including a splenectomy performed by Michael DeBakey. On 28 March 1980, Mohammad Reza's French and American doctors finally performed an operation meant to have been performed in the fall of 1979. Kean recalled: The operation went beautifully. That night, however, was terrible. The medical team-American, Egyptian, French-was in the pathology lab. The focus was on the Shah's cancerous spleen, grotesquely swollen to 20 times normal. It was one-foot long, literally the size of a football. But I was drawn to the liver tissues that had also been removed. The liver was speckled with white. Malignancy. The cancer had hit the liver. The Shah would soon die ... The tragedy is that a man who should have had the best and easiest medical care had, in many respects, the worst. By that point, it was arranged by President Sadat that Soraya would quietly visit Mohammad Reza on his deathbed in Egypt without Farah present, but Milani noted the two were \"star-crossed lovers\" and Mohammad Reza died before Soraya could come to Egypt from her home in Paris.\n\nMohammad Reza died from complications of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia on 27 July 1980, aged 60. Egyptian President Sadat gave the Shah a state funeral. In addition to members of the Pahlavi family, Anwar Sadat, Richard Nixon and Constantine II of Greece attended the funeral ceremony in Cairo.\n\nMohammad Reza is buried in the Al Rifa'i Mosque in Cairo, a mosque of great symbolic importance. Also buried there is Farouk of Egypt, Mohammad Reza's former brother-in-law. The tombs lie to the left of the entrance. Years earlier, his father and predecessor, Reza Shah had also initially been buried at the Al Rifa'i Mosque.\n\nIn 1969, Mohammad Reza sent one of 73 Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing. The message still rests on the lunar surface today. He stated in part, \"we pray the Almighty God to guide mankind towards ever increasing success in the establishment of culture, knowledge and human civilisation\". The Apollo 11 crew visited Mohammad Reza during a world tour.\n\nShortly after his overthrow, Mohammad Reza wrote an autobiographical memoir \"Réponse à l'histoire\" (\"Answer to History\"). It was translated from the original French into English, Persian (\"Pasokh be Tarikh\"), and other languages. However, by the time of its publication, the Shah had already died. The book is his personal account of his reign and accomplishments, as well as his perspective on issues related to the Iranian Revolution and Western foreign policy toward Iran. He places some of the blame for the wrongdoings of SAVAK, and the failures of various democratic and social reforms (particularly through the White Revolution), upon Amir Abbas Hoveyda and his administration.\nHussein-Ali Montazeri, who was once the designated successor to Ruhollah Khomeini, said that the Shah did not kill even 10 per cent of what Ruhollah Khomeini's regime had killed.\nRecently, the Shah's reputation has experienced something of a revival in Iran, with some people looking back on his era as a time when Iran was more prosperous and the government less oppressive. Journalist Afshin Molavi reported that some members of the uneducated poor—traditionally core supporters of the revolution that overthrew the Shah—were making remarks such as, \"God bless the Shah's soul, the economy was better then\", and found that \"books about the former Shah (even censored ones) sell briskly\", while \"books of the Rightly Guided Path sit idle\". On 28 October 2016, thousands of people in Iran celebrating Cyrus Day at the Tomb of Cyrus, chanted slogans in support of him, and against the current Islamic regime of Iran and Arabs, and many were subsequently arrested.\n\nMohammad Reza published several books in the course of his kingship and two later works after his downfall. Amongst others, these include:\n\nUnder Mohammad Reza's father, the government supported advancements by women against child marriage, polygamy, exclusion from public society, and education segregation. However, independent feminist political groups were shut down and forcibly integrated into one state-created institution, which maintained many paternalistic views. Despite substantial opposition from Shiite religious jurists, the Iranian feminist movement, led by activists such as Fatemah Sayyeh, achieved further advancement under Mohammad Reza. His regime's changes focused on the civil sphere, and private-oriented family law remained restrictive, although the 1967 and 1975 Family Protection Laws attempted to reform this trend. During the reign of Shah, women gained the right to freely choose any profession, for example first female Iranian ministers such as Farrokhroo Parsa and judges such as Shirin Ebadi, while Mehrangiz Dowlatshahi became the first female cabinet member and ambassador of Iran. These activities alienated Islamic traditionalists and hastened the fall of the Shah.\n\nFrom his mother, Mohammad Reza inherited an almost messianic belief in his own greatness and that God was working in his favour, which explained the often passive and fatalistic attitudes that he displayed as an adult. In 1973, Mohammad Reza told the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci:A king who does not need to account to anyone for what he says and does is unavoidably doomed to loneliness. However, I am not entirely alone, because a force others can't perceive accompanies me. My mystical force. Moreover, I receive messages. I have lived with God besides me since I was 5 years old. Since, that is, God sent me those visions. Mohamed Reza often spoke in public and in private from childhood onward of his belief that God had chosen him for a \"divine mission\" to transform Iran, as he believed that dreams he had as a child of the Twelve Imams of Shia Islam were all messages from God. In his 1961 book \"Mission for My Country\", Mohammad Reza wrote: From the time I was six or seven, I have felt that perhaps there is a supreme being, who is guiding me. I don't know. Sometimes the thought disturbs me because then, I ask myself, what is my own personality, and am I possessed of free will? Still, I often reflect, if I am driven-or perhaps I should say supported-by another force, there must be a reason. In his biography of the Shah, Marvin Zonis has argued that Mohammad Reza really believed in these claims of divine support. Shia Islam has no tradition of describing Shahs being favoured with messages from God, very few Shahs had ever claimed that their dreams were divine messages, and most people in the West laughed and snickered at Mohammad Reza's claim that his dreams were messages from God. Reza Khan who was an atheist dismissed these visions as nonsense, and told his son to have more common sense.\n\nMohammad Reza inherited the wealth built by his father Reza Shah who preceded him as king of Iran and became known as the richest person in Iran during his reign, with his wealth estimated to be higher than 600 million rials and including vast amounts of land and numerous large estates especially in the province of Mazandaran obtained usually at a fraction of their real price. Reza Shah, facing criticism for his wealth, decided to pass on all of his land and wealth to his eldest son Mohammad Reza in exchange for a sugar cube, known in Iran as \"habbe kardan\". However shortly after obtaining the wealth Mohammad Reza was ordered by his father and then king to transfer a million toman ($500,000) to each of his siblings. By 1958 it was estimated that the companies possessed by Mohammad Reza had a value of $157 million (in 1958 USD) with an estimated additional $100 million saved outside Iran. Rumours of his and his family's corruption began to surface which greatly damaged his reputation. This formed one of the reasons for the creation of the Pahlavi Foundation and the distribution of additional land to the people of some 2,000 villages inherited by his father, often at very low and discounted prices. In 1958, using funds from inherited crown estates, Mohammad Reza established the Pahlavi Foundation which functioned as a tax-exempt charity and held all his assets, including 830 villages spanning a total area of 2.5 million hectares. According to Business Insider, Mohammad Reza had set up the organisation \"to pursue Iran's charitable interests in the U.S.\" At its height, the organisation was estimated to be worth $3 billion, however, on numerous occasions, the Pahlavi Foundation was accused of corruption. Despite these charges, in his book \"Answer to History\", Pahlavi affirms that he \"never made the slightest profit\" out of the Foundation.\n\nIn a 1974 interview which was shown in a documentary titled \"Crisis in Iran\", Mohammad Reza told Mike Wallace that the rumours of corruption were \"the most unjust thing that I have heard,\" calling them a \"cheap accusation\" whilst arguing the allegations were not as serious as those regarding other governments, including that of the United States. In November 1978, after Pahlavi dismissed Prime Minister Jafar Sharif-Emami and appointed a military government, he pledged in a televised address \"not to repeat the past mistakes and illegalities, the cruelty and corruption.\" Despite this, the royal family's wealth can be seen as one of the factors behind the Iranian revolution. This was due to the oil crises of the 1970s which increased inflation resulting in economic austerity measures which made lower class workers more inclined to protest.\n\nMohammad Reza's wealth remained considerable during his time in exile. While staying in the Bahamas he offered to purchase the island that he was staying on for $425 million (in 1979 USD), however his offer was rejected by the Bahamas which claimed that the island was worth far more. On 17 October 1979, again in exile and perhaps knowing the gravity of his illness, he split up his wealth amongst his family members, giving 20% to Farah, 20% to his eldest son Reza, 15% to Farahnaz, 15% to Leila, 20% to his younger son, in addition to giving 8% to Shahnaz and 2% to his granddaughter Mahnaz Zahedi.\nOn 14 January 1979, an article titled \"Little pain expected in exile for Shah\" by The Spokesman Review newspaper found that the Pahlavi dynasty had amassed one of the largest private fortunes in the world; estimated then at well over $1 billion. It also stated that a document submitted to the ministry of justice, in protest of the royal family's activity in many sectors of the nation's economy, detailed the Pahlavis dominating role in the economy of Iran. The list showed that the Pahlavi dynasty had interests in, amongst other things, 17 banks and insurance companies, including a 90 per cent ownership in the nation's third-largest insurance company, 25 metal enterprises, 8 mining companies, 10 building materials companies, including 25 per cent of the largest cement company, 45 construction companies, 43 food companies, and 26 enterprises in trade or commerce, including a share of ownership in almost every major hotel in Iran; the Pahlavis also has major interests in real estate. Mohammad Reza was assigned a personal budget, taken from the treasury, with amounts varying between $43 million and $1 billion per year.\n\nMohammad Reza was also known for his interest in cars and had a personal collection of 140 classic and sports cars including a Mercedes-Benz 500K Autobahn cruiser, one of only six ever made. The first Maserati 5000 GT was named the \"Shah of Persia\", it was built for Mohammad Reza, who had been impressed by the Maserati 3500 and requested Giulio Alfieri, Maserati's chief engineer, to use a modified 5-litre engine from the Maserati 450S on the 3500GT's chassis.\n\nMohammad Reza was Sovereign of many orders in Iran, and received honours and decorations from around the world. Mohammad Reza used the style \"His Majesty\" until his imperial coronation in 1967, ascending to the title of Shahanshah, when he adopted the style \"His Imperial Majesty\". Mohammad Reza also held many supplementary titles such as Bozorg Artestaran, a military rank superseding his prior position as Captain. On 15 September 1965, Mohammad Reza was granted the title of \"Aryamehr\" ('Light of the Aryans') by an extraordinary session of the joint Houses of Parliament.\n\nFrom 24 April 1926 until his accession, Mohammad Reza's arms notably consisted of two Shahbaz birds in the centre, a common symbol during the Achaemenid period, with the Pahlavi Crown placed above them. Upon his accession, he adopted his father's coat of arms which included a shield composed of the Lion and the Sun symbol in first quarter, the Faravahar in the second quarter, the two-pointed sword of Ali (Zulfiqar) in third quarter and the Simurgh in the fourth quarter. Overall in the centre is a circle depicting Mount Damavand with a rising sun, the symbol of the Pahlavi dynasty. The shield is crowned by the Pahlavi crown and surrounded by the chain of the Order of Pahlavi. Two lions rampant regardant, holding scimitars supports the coat of arms on either side. Under the whole device is the motto: \"Mara dad farmud va Khod Davar Ast\" (\"Justice He bids me do, as He will judge me\" or, alternatively, \"He gave me power to command, and He is the judge\").\n\nThe Pahlavi imperial family employed rich heraldry to symbolise their reign and ancient Persian heritage. An image of the imperial crown was included in every official state document and symbol, from the badges of the armed forces to paper money and coinage. The image of the crown was the centerpiece of the imperial standard of the Shah.\n\nThe personal standards consisted of a field of pale blue, the traditional colour of the Iranian imperial family, at the centre of which was placed the heraldic motif of the individual. The Imperial Iranian national flag was placed in the top left quadrant of each standard. The appropriate imperial standard was flown beside the national flag when the individual was present. In 1971, new designs were adopted.\n\n\n\n"}

A member of the Knesset between 1973 and 1992 and again from 1999 until 2003, he served as Minister of Defense three times and once as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Arens has also served as the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and was a professor at the Technion in Haifa.\n\nMoshe Arens was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, to a Jewish family. His father was an industrialist and his mother was a dentist. When he was a year old, his family moved to Riga, Latvia. where he attended elementary school. In 1939, Arens and his family immigrated to the United States, where his father had business interests. The family settled in New York City, where Arens attended George Washington High School.\n\nAs a youth, Arens was a leader in the Betar youth movement. During World War II, Arens served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a technical sergeant. Following the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948, Arens moved to the new State of Israel and joined the Irgun, despite the opposition of his father. He was sent to North Africa (mostly Morocco and Algeria) and Europe to help local Jewish communities establish self-defense groups. In March 1949, he returned to Israel, and became a founding member of the Herut party, which had grown out of the Irgun. After being denied a job in Israel's military industries, he began working as an engineer for an American company dealing in designing water systems for Tel Aviv.\n\nIn 1951, he returned to the United States, and studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and aeronautical engineering at the California Institute of Technology where he was a student of Qian Xuesen, then worked for a time in the aircraft industry. He returned to Israel in 1957, and became professor of aeronautics at the Technion, serving in this position until 1962. From 1962 until 1971 he was a Deputy Director General at Israel Aircraft Industries, where he was in charge of most major development projects, including the Kfir fighter jet project.\n\nWhile living in the United States, Arens married Muriel F. Eisenberg from New York City, and she moved to Israel with him. The couple had four children, two boys and two girls; Yigal, Aliza, Raanan, and Rut. Arens is chairman of the International Board of Governors of the Ariel University Center of Samaria and writes for \"Haaretz\". \nIn 1971, Arens won the Israel Defense Prize.\n\nAfter the Yom Kippur War he entered politics and was elected to the Knesset as a member of Likud in the 1973 elections. After being re-elected in 1977, he became chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He voted against the Camp David Accords and the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. In 1980, Prime Minister Menachem Begin offered Arens the post of Minister of Defense, but he turned it down due to his disagreement over the terms of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. Arens did not oppose peace with Egypt, but was opposed to certain aspects of the treaty, and thus did not want to have to oversee Israel's evacuation from the Sinai.\n\nHe was re-elected again in 1981, but resigned from the Knesset on 19 January 1982 when appointed ambassador to the United States. At this point, he brought his young protégé, Benjamin Netanyahu, then 32, to work for him in Washington. He returned to Israel in February 1983 after being appointed Minister of Defense, replacing Ariel Sharon, who had been forced out of office following the Kahan Commission's report on the Sabra and Shatila massacre. He was re-elected in 1984, but was only appointed Minister without Portfolio. After another re-election in 1988 he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs (with Netanyahu his deputy), and in 1990 returned to the Defense portfolio.\n\nAfter Likud lost the 1992 elections, Arens retired from politics. He returned in 1999, however, to challenge Binyamin Netanyahu for the Likud leadership. Although he failed in his challenge, winning only 18% of the vote, Netanyahu appointed him Minister of Defense, replacing Yitzhak Mordechai, who had left Likud to establish the Centre Party. Although Arens returned to the Knesset after the 1999 elections, Likud lost the elections and he left the cabinet. He lost his seat for the final time in 2003.\n\nArens questioned the wisdom of Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Israeli procurement, given the neglected state of Israeli ground forces. In an article for Fathom Journal, Arens stated that he was a critic of unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, accusing its proponents of suffering from \"unilateral withdrawal syndrome\".\n\nAfter retiring from the government, he devoted himself to researching and commemorating the story of the Jewish Military Union (ŻZW), which fought alongside the better known Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB) in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Arens is the author of a number of articles on the revolt as well as a book, \"Flags over the Warsaw Ghetto\", which appeared in Hebrew, Polish and English.\n\n"}

{"id": "321887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321887", "title": "Ogier the Dane", "text": "Ogier the Dane\n\nOgier the Dane (; ) is a legendary knight of Charlemagne who appears in many Old French \"chansons de geste\". In particular, he features as the protagonist in \"La chevalerie Ogier\" (ca. 1220), which belongs to the \"Geste de Doon de Mayence\" (\"cycle of the rebellious vassals\"). The first part of this epic, the \"enfance\"[\"s\"] (childhood exploits) of Ogier, is marked by his duel against a Saracen from whom he obtains the sword Corte, followed by victory over another Saracen opponent from whom he wins the horse Broiefort. In subsequent parts, Ogier turns into a rebel with cause, seeking refuge with the King of Lombardy and warring with Charlemagne for many years, until he is eventually reconciled when a dire need for him emerges after another Saracen incursion.\n\nHis character is a composite based on a historical Autcharius Francus who was aligned with king Desiderius of Lombardy against Charlemagne. The legend of a certain Othgerius buried in Meaux is also incorporated into the \"Chevalerie\". In Scandinavia he was first known as Oddgeir danski in the Old Norse prose translation \"Karlamagnús saga\", but later became more widely known as Holger Danske and was given the pedigree of being Olaf son of King Gøtrik, in a Danish translation published in the 16th century. Holger Danske became a Danish folklore hero, with a sleeping hero motif attached to him.\n\nThe Ogier character is generally believed to be based on Autcharius Francus (or Otkerus), a Frankish knight who had served Carloman and escorted his widow and young children to Desiderius, King of Lombardy, but eventually surrendered to Charlemagne. The Ogier character could also have been partly constructed from the historical Adalgis (or Algisus), son of Desiderius, who played a similar role. The \"chanson de geste\" does parallel this, and Ogier does seek refuge with the Lombardian king Didier or Désier (as Desiderius is styled in French).\n\nAn unrelated Othgerius (Otgerius), a benefactor buried at the Abbey of Saint Faro in Meaux in France, became connected with Ogier by a work called \"Conversio Othgeri militis\" (ca. 1070–1080) written by the monks there. This tradition is reflected in the \"chanson\" of Ogier, which states that the hero was buried at Meaux.\n\nThere is no Ogier of consequence in Danish history; at least, no Ogier as such appears in Saxo Grammaticus's \"Gesta Danorum\". However, the Danish work \"Holger Danskes Krønike\" (1534) made Ogier into the son of King Gøtrek of Denmark (namely Olaf son of Gøtrek, mentioned by Saxo). \"Olgerus, dux Daniæ\" (\"Olger, War-Leader of the Danes\") had rebuilt the St. Martin's monastery pillaged by the Saxons in 778, according to the chronicle of this monastery at Cologne (ca. 1050). However, this is not a contemporary record and may just be poetic fiction.\n\nOgier the Dane had a sword named Cortain (also spelled Courtain, Cortana, Curtana, etc.) This name is the accusative case declension of Old French \"corte\", meaning \"short\".\n\nThe tradition that Ogier had a short sword is quite old. There is an entry for \"Oggero \"spata curta\"\" (\"Ogier of the short sword\") in the (ca. 1065–1075), and this is taken as a nickname derived from his sword-name Cortain. The sword name does not appear in the oldest extant copy of \"La chanson de Roland\" (Oxford manuscript), only in versions postdating the \"Nota\". According to the first part (\"enfances\") of \"Chevalerie Ogier\", the sword, which once belonged to Brumadant the Savage, was remade more than twenty times; finally it was tested on a block of marble and broke about a palm's length. It was reforged and named Corte or Cortain, meaning \"short\". This became the weapon of a chivalric-minded Saracen named Karaheut, who gives it to Ogier so he can fight Brunamont in single combat. The sword has appeared in chansons de geste somewhat predating \"Chevalerie Ogier\", or composed around the same time as it, such as \"Aspremont\" (before 1190) and \"Renaut de Montauban\" (c. 1200).\n\nThe \"Prose Tristan\" (1230–1235, expanded in 1240) states that Ogier inherited the sword of the Arthurian knight Tristan, shortening it and thus naming it \"Cortaine\". The English monarchy also laid claim to owning \"Tristram's sword\", and this according to Roger Sherman Loomis was the \"Curtana\" (\"short\") used in the coronation of the British monarch.\n\nOgier the Dane's first appearance (spelled \"Oger\") in any work is in \"Chanson de Roland\" (c. 1060), where he is not named as one of the douzepers (twelve peers or paladins) of Charlemagne, although he is usually one of the twelve peers in other works. In the poeticized Battle of Ronceveaux, Ogier is assigned to be the vanguard and commands the Bavarian Army in the battle against Baligant in the later half. He plays only a minor part in this poem, and it is unclear what becomes of him, but the \"Pseudo-Turpin\" knows of a tradition that Ogier was killed at Roncevaux.\n\nA full career of Ogier from youth to death is treated in \"La Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche\", a 13th-century assonanced poem of approximately 13,000 lines attributed to Raimbert de Paris. It relates Ogier's early years, his rebellion against Charles and eventual reconciliation. This is now considered a retelling. Ogier in a lost original \"\"Chevalerie Ogier\" primitive\" is thought to have fought alongside the Lombards because Charlemagne attacked at the Pope's bidding, as historically happened in the Siege of Pavia (773–74), that is, there was no fighting with the Saracens as a prelude to this.\n\nThe legend that Ogier fought valiantly with some Saracens in his youth is the chief material of the first branch (about 3,000 lines) of Raimbert's \"Chevalerie Ogier\". This is also recounted in \"Enfances Ogier\" (c. 1270), a rhymed poem of 9,229 lines by Adenet le Roi. The story of Ogier's youth develops with close similarity in these two works starting at the beginning, but they diverge at a certain point when Raimbert's version begins to be more economical with the details.\n\nOgier in versions of the Renaissance travels to the Avalon ruled by King Arthur and eventually becomes Morgan le Fay's paramour. This is how the story culminates in \"Roman d'Ogier\", a reworking in Alexandrines written in the 14th century, as well as its prose redaction retitled \"Ogier le Danois\" (\"Ogyer le Danois\") printed in a number of editions from the late 15th century onwards.\n\nThere are also several texts that might be classed as \"histories\" which refer to Ogier. Girart d'Amiens' \"Charlemagne\" contains a variant of Ogier's \"enfances\". Jean d'Outremeuse's \"Ly Myreur des Histors\" writes of Ogier's combat with the \"capalus\" (chapalu). Philippe Mouskes's 13th-century \"Chronique rimée\" writes on Ogier's death.\n\nOgier is the main character in the poem \"La Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche\" (written ca. 1200–1215). Here he is the son of Geoffroy de Danemarche given as a hostage to Charlemagne. Ogier's son is slain by Charlot, son of Charlemagne. Ogier attacks Charlot and demands his life in revenge, resulting in his banishment. Ogier wars with Charlemagne for seven years and survives prison for another seven years. They eventually make peace and Ogier goes to fight at Charlemagne's side against the Saracens, in which battle he slays the giant Brehus. The work consists of twelve parts (or \"branches\") of varying lengths.\n\nOgier, a condemned hostage, is initially an unarmed spectator when Charles fights Saracens in Italy at the Pope's request. But when the French suffer a setback, Ogier joins the fight, seizing a flag and arms from a fleeing standard-bearer, and is knighted by the king in gratitude. Next, Ogier accepts the challenge of single combat from the Saracen Karaheut, but enemies interrupt and abduct Ogier. Karaheut protests for Ogier's release, to no avail, and loses his engagement to the admiral's daughter. She now wishes to marry the newcomer on the battlefield, Brunamont of Maiolgre (Majorca), but her wish will only be granted if a champion fights against Brunamont, and she names Ogier. Ogier, armed with Karaheut's sword Cortain, vanquishes Brunamont and wins the horse Broiefort.\n\nThe 14th-century \"Roman d'Ogier\" is a \"\" in Alexandrines of 29,000 verses. In this version, Ogier is fated to be taken away by Morgan le Fay to Avalon and become her paramour. This fate is set in motion while Ogier is still a newborn in his crib. Six fées visit the baby, each with a gift, and Morgan's gift is longevity and life living with her. Ogier has an enhanced career, even becoming King of England, and when he reaches the age of 100, he is shipwrecked by Morgan so he can be conveyed to Avalon. He returns after two hundred years to save France, and is given a firebrand which must not be allowed to be burnt down for him to remain alive. Ogier tries to forfeit his life after accomplishing his task but is save by Morgan. It states the Ogier and Morgan have a son named Meurvin, who himself became the subject of a lengthy Renaissance era romance.\n\nA legend of \"Conversio Othgeri militis\" was invented by the monks at the abbey of Saint Faro at Meaux around 1070–1080. It claimed Othgerius Francus (\"Frankish\") to be the most illustrious member of Charlemagne's court after the king himself, thus making him identifiable with Ogier the Dane. He was buried in the abbey in a mausoleum built for him. His remains were placed in a sarcophagus lidded with his recumbent tomb effigy lying next to that of Saint Benedictus, and the chamber was enshrined with erect statues of various figures from the Charlemagne Cycle.\n\nThis document was first commented on by Jean Mabillon in his \"Acta Sanctorum Ordinis S. Benedicti\", printed editions of which include a detailed illustration of the mausoleum at St. Faro. The statues at the mausoleum even included la belle Aude, affianced to Roland, with one of the inscriptions there (according to Mabillon) claiming that Aude was Ogier's sister. It underwent restoration in 1535 by the Italian Gabriele Simeoni. That mausoleum is no longer preserved, but an illustration of the interior was printed in editions of Mabillon's \"Acta Sanctorum Ordinis S. Benedicti\". \n\nA stone head later found in Meaux was determined to be Ogier's head from comparisons with these incunabula etchings. This stone head can still be viewed today.\n\nThe early form of the \"chanson de geste\" was translated in the 13th century into Old Norse as \"Oddgeirs þáttr danska\" (\"Story of Oddgeir danski\"), Branch III of the \"Karlamagnús saga\". An Old Danish version of it, \"Karl Magnus krønike\", was later created (some copies date to 1480).\n\nThe 16th-century \"Olger Danskes krønike\" was a Danish translation of the French prose romance \"Ogier le Danois\" by Kristiern Pedersen, started while in Paris in 1514–1515, probably completed during his second sojourn in 1527, and printed in 1534 in Malmö. Pedersen also fused the romance with Danish genealogy, thus making Ogier the son of Danish king Gøtrik (Godfred).\n\n\"Holger Danske og Burmand\" (DgF 30, TSB E 133) recounts the fight between the hero and Burmand, described as a giant (and not a Saracen). The ballad also exists in Swedish (SMB 216) and tells the story of how Holger Dansk is released from prison to fight against a troll by the name of Burman.\n\nSimilar to Frederick Barbarossa, Saint Wenceslas and King Arthur, Ogier in Danish legend becomes a king in the mountain; he is said to dwell in the castle of Kronborg, his beard grown down to the floor. He will sleep there until some day when the country of Denmark is in peril, at which time he will rise up and save the nation. This is a common folklore motif, classed as Type 1960.2, \"The King Asleep in the Mountain\". According to the tour guides of Kronborg Castle, legend has it that Holger sat down in his present location after walking all the way from his complete battles in France.\n\nThe 1789 opera \"Holger Danske\", composed by F.L.Æ. Kunzen with a libretto by Jens Baggesen, had a considerable impact on Danish nationalism in the late 18th century. It spawned the literary \"Holger feud\", which revealed the increasing dissatisfaction among the native Danish population with the German influence on Danish society. The Danish intellectual Peter Andreas Heiberg joined the feud by writing a satirical version entitled \"Holger Tyske\" (\"Holger the German\") ridiculing Baggesen's lyrics. During the German occupation of Denmark, presentation of the same opera in Copenhagen became a manifestation of Danish national feeling and opposition to the occupation.\n\nThe hero's popularity led to him being depicted on 15th- and 16th-century paintings in two churches in Denmark and Sweden. The Holger Danske and Burman painted on the ceiling of Floda Church in Sweden are attributed to Albertus Pictor around 1480. It also includes the text \"Holger Dane won victory over Burman\"; this is the burden of the Danish and Swedish ballad, but the painting predates other written texts for this ballad.\n\nThe Hotel Marienlyst in Helsingør commissioned a statue of Holger Danske in 1907 from the sculptor Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan. The bronze statue was outside the hotel until 2013, when it was sold and moved to Skjern. The bronze statue was based on an original in plaster. The plaster statue was placed in the vaults at Kronborg castle, also in Helsingør, where it became a popular attraction in its own right. The plaster statue was replaced by a concrete copy in 1985.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is affiliated with the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University in California. He has held previous academic appointments at the University of Cambridge, University College London, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, University of Adelaide and Macquarie University. His research interests are in the fields of cosmology, quantum field theory, and astrobiology. He proposed that a one-way trip to Mars could be a viable option.\n\nIn 2005, he took up the chair of the SETI: Post-Detection Science and Technology Taskgroup of the International Academy of Astronautics. He is also an adviser to the Microbes Mind Forum.\n\nDavies was brought up in Finchley, London. He attended Woodhouse Grammar School and then studied physics at University College London, gaining a first class Bachelor of Science degree in 1967.\n\nIn 1970, he completed his PhD under the supervision of Michael J. Seaton and Sigurd Zienau at University College London. He then carried out postdoctoral research under Fred Hoyle at the University of Cambridge.\n\nDavies' inquiries have included theoretical physics, cosmology, and astrobiology; his research has been mainly in the area of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. His notable contributions are the so-called Fulling–Davies–Unruh effect, according to which an observer accelerating through empty space will be subject to a bath of induced thermal radiation, and the Bunch–Davies vacuum state, often used as the basis for explaining the fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation left over from the big bang. A paper co-authored with Stephen Fulling and William Unruh was the first to suggest that black holes evaporating via the Hawking effect lose mass as a result of a flux of negative energy streaming into the hole from the surrounding space. Davies has had a longstanding association with the problem of time's arrow, and was also an early proponent of the theory that life on Earth may have come from Mars cocooned in rocks ejected by asteroid and comet impacts. During his time in Australia he helped establish the Australian Centre for Astrobiology.\n\nDavies was a co-author of Felisa Wolfe-Simon on the \"Science\" article \"A Bacterium That Can Grow by Using Arsenic Instead of Phosphorus\". Reports refuting the most significant aspects of the original results were published in the same journal in 2012, including by researchers from the University of British Columbia and Princeton University.\n\nDavies is Principal Investigator at Arizona State University's Center for Convergence of Physical Science and Cancer Biology. This is part of a program set up by the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute to involve physicists in cancer research which has set up a network of 12 Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers.\n\nDavies' talent as a communicator of science has been recognized in Australia by an Advance Australia Award and two Eureka Prizes, and in the UK by the 2001 Kelvin Medal and Prize by the Institute of Physics, and the 2002 Faraday Prize by The Royal Society. Davies received the Templeton Prize in 1995.\n\nDavies was made a member of the Order of Australia in the 2007 Queen's birthday honours list.\n\nThe minor planet 6870 Pauldavies is named after him.\n\nDavies writes and comments on scientific and philosophical issues. He made a documentary series for BBC Radio 3, and two Australian television series, \"The Big Questions\" and \"More Big Questions\". His BBC documentary \"The Cradle of Life\" featured the subject of his Faraday Prize lecture. He writes regularly for newspapers and magazines worldwide. He has been guest on numerous radio and television programmes including the children's podcast programme \"Ask A Biologist\".\n\nA 2007 opinion piece \"Taking Science on Faith\" in the \"New York Times\", generated controversy over its exploration of the role of faith in scientific inquiry. Davies argued that the faith scientists have in the immutability of physical laws has origins in Christian theology, and that the claim that science is \"free of faith\" is \"manifestly bogus.\" The Edge Foundation presented a criticism of Davies' article written by Jerry Coyne, Nathan Myhrvold, Lawrence Krauss, Scott Atran, Sean Carroll, Jeremy Bernstein, PZ Myers, Lee Smolin, John Horgan, Alan Sokal and a response by Davies beginning \"I was dismayed at how many of my detractors completely misunderstood what I had written. Indeed, their responses bore the hallmarks of a superficial knee-jerk reaction to the sight of the words \"science\" and \"faith\" juxtaposed.\" While atheists Richard Dawkins and Victor J. Stenger have criticised Davies' public stance on science and religion, others, including the John Templeton Foundation, have praised his work.\n\nDavies wrote an article in the \"Wall Street Journal\" describing the background to the December 2010 arsenic bacteria press conference and stating that he supported the finding of Felisa Wolfe-Simon that arsenic can replace phosphorus because \"I had the advantage of being unencumbered by knowledge. I dropped chemistry at the age of 16, and all I knew about arsenic came from Agatha Christie novels.\" He also made the statement, \"Well, I would be astonished if this was the only arsenic-based organism on Earth and Felisa just happened to scrape it up from the bottom of Mono Lake on the first try, It's quite clear that it is the tip of an iceberg. I think it's a window into a whole new world of microbiology. And as a matter of fact, she already has 20 or so candidate other organisms that we're very anxious to take a look at. I think we're going to see a whole new domain of life here.\" It was later independently demonstrated that the organism's DNA contained no arsenic at all. In a similar vein, a 2013 article in \"The Guardian\" by Davies suggested that the origin of life will be uncovered through information theory rather than chemistry. Concerns have been raised about his responsibility as one of Wolfe-Simon's co-authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn an Ultimate Explanation:\n"}

However, RC Toulonnais owner Mourad Boudjellal pronounced himself \"unsatisfied\" with Sackey's performance and he was released in May 2011. Sackey returned to England to play for Harlequins in the Aviva Premiership in the 2013/14 season.\n\nIn 2001 he was included in the Senior England tour party that played the United States and Canada. He scored twice in their 83–21 win over USA 'A' in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2003, Sackey also played for the England Saxons against the Ireland Wolfhounds. He was a member of the England Saxons squad for the 2004 Churchill Cup, that played Canada and the New Zealand Māori.\n\nHe was named in a 30-man squad for the 2006 end of year rugby tests. After Mark Cueto pulled out through injury he was named in the starting line-up to face the All Blacks and made his England debut on Sunday, 5 November 2006. His first try came a week later in England's 25–18 home defeat to Argentina. However he was unable to build on his performances in these games after being forced out of the two subsequent games against South Africa and the 2007 Six Nations Championship through injury.\n\nSackey was included in the training squad, and later (in August 2007) the final 30-man squad, for the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIn the group stage, he was notable for two tries in a 44–22 victory over Samoa, and two more in the final group match against Tonga, which secured England's place in the quarter-finals, where he impressed against Australia, managing to prevent a possible try. Sackey played in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final. Sackey also played in the 2008 Six Nations Championship and performed well, scoring 3 tries.\n\nSackey was not in his best form during the 2009 Six Nations Championship and was dropped after England's defeat to Wales and did not feature in the last three games of the tournament.\n\nSackey, in July 2008, travelled to his parents' home country, Ghana, to gain a better understanding of the development of the sport there. A huge crowd of over 500 schoolchildren greeted him, with several games put on in his honour. This included an exhibition game between Kotababi and Unity Primary schools; of which some children travelled to the United Kingdom in October 2008 to participate in a tournament arranged by charity Tour Aid.\n\nSackey has two brothers, called Eddie and Kojo. He also has two sisters called Beverly and Annabel. In 2006 Paul set up his own car-sourcing business, finding and selling top-of-the-range cars including, in one case, a £330,000 Robin Reliant. He is an expert on the life of Cicero, and published a monograph on his role in the fall of the Roman Republic in 2008.\n\n"}

Signer of the Texas Declaration, Colonel, and a transitional founder of the Republic of Texas into the United States as a constituent state.

{"id": "1052385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052385", "title": "Robert Walser (writer)", "text": "Robert Walser (writer)\n\nRobert Walser (15 April 1878 – 25 December 1956) was a German-speaking Swiss writer.\n\nWalser is understood to be the missing link between Kleist and Kafka. \"Indeed\", writes Susan Sontag, \"At the time [of Walser's writing], it was more likely to be Kafka [who was understood by posterity] through the prism of Walser. Robert Musil, another admirer among Walser's contemporaries, when he first read Kafka pronounced [Kafka's work] as, 'a peculiar case of the Walser type.'\" Walser was admired early on by writers including Musil, Hermann Hesse, Stefan Zweig, Walter Benjamin and Franz Kafka, and was in fact better known in his lifetime than Kafka or Benjamin, for example, were known in their lifetimes.\n\nNevertheless, Walser was never able to support himself based on the meager income he made from his writings, and he worked as a copyist, an inventor's assistant, a butler and in various other low-paying trades. Despite marginal early success in his literary career, the popularity of his work gradually diminished over the second and third decades of the 20th century, making it increasingly difficult for him to support himself through writing. He eventually suffered a nervous breakdown, and spent the remainder of his life in sanatoriums, taking frequent long walks. A revival of interest in his work arose when, in the late twentieth century and the early 2000s, his writings from the Pencil Zone, also known as \"Bleistiftgebiet\" or \"the Microscripts\", which had been written in a coded, microscopically tiny hand on scraps of paper collected while in a Waldau sanatorium, were finally deciphered, translated, and published.\n\nWalser was born into a family with many children. His brother Karl Walser became a well-known stage designer and painter. Walser grew up in Biel, Switzerland, on the language border between the German- and French-speaking cantons of Switzerland, and grew up speaking both languages. He attended primary school and progymnasium, which he had to leave before the final exam when his family could no longer bear the cost. From his early years on, he was an enthusiastic theatre-goer; his favourite play was \"The Robbers\" by Friedrich Schiller. There is a watercolor painting that shows Walser as Karl Moor, the protagonist of that play.\n\nFrom 1892 to 1895, Walser served an apprenticeship at the Bernische Kantonalbank in Biel. Afterwards he worked for a short time in Basel. Walser's mother, who was \"emotionally disturbed\", died in 1894 after being under medical care for a long period. In 1895, Walser went to Stuttgart where his brother Karl lived. He was an office worker at the Deutsche Verlagsanstalt and at the Cotta'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung; he also tried, without success, to become an actor. On foot, he returned to Switzerland where he registered in 1896 as a Zürich resident. In the following years, he often worked as a \"Kommis\", an office clerk, but irregularly and in many different places. As a result, he was one of the first Swiss writers to introduce into literature a description of the life of a salaried employee.\n\nIn 1898, the influential critic Joseph Victor Widmann published a series of poems by Walser in the Bernese newspaper \"Der Bund\". This came to the attention of Franz Blei, and he introduced Walser to the Art Nouveau people around the magazine \"Die Insel\", including Frank Wedekind, Max Dauthendey and Otto Julius Bierbaum. Numerous short stories and poems by Walser appeared in \"Die Insel.\"\n\nUntil 1905, Walser lived mainly in Zürich, though he often changed lodgings and also lived for a time in Thun, Solothurn, Winterthur and Munich. In 1903, he fulfilled his military service obligation and, beginning that summer, was the \"aide\" of an engineer and inventor in Wädenswil near Zürich. This episode became the basis of his 1908 novel \"Der Gehülfe\" (\"The Assistant\"). In 1904, his first book, \"Fritz Kochers Aufsätze\", appeared in the \"Insel Verlag\".\n\nAt the end of 1905 he attended a course in order to become a servant at the castle of Dambrau in Upper Silesia. The theme of serving would characterize his work in the following years, especially in the novel \"Jakob von Gunten\" (1909). In 1905, he went to live in Berlin, where his brother Karl Walser, who was working as a theater painter, introduced him to other figures in literature, publishing, and the theater. Occasionally, Walser worked as secretary for the artists' corporation Berliner Secession.\n\nIn Berlin, Walser wrote the novels \"Geschwister Tanner\", \"Der Gehülfe\" and \"Jakob von Gunten\". They were issued by the publishing house of Bruno Cassirer, where Christian Morgenstern worked as editor. Apart from the novels, he wrote many short stories, sketching popular bars from the point of view of a poor \"flaneur\" in a very playful and subjective language. There was a very positive echo to his writings. Robert Musil and Kurt Tucholsky, among others, stated their admiration for Walser's prose, and authors like Hermann Hesse and Franz Kafka counted him among their favorite writers.\n\nWalser published numerous short stories in newspapers and magazines, many for instance in the \"Schaubühne.\" They became his trademark. The larger part of his work is composed of short stories – literary sketches that elude a ready categorization. Selections of these short stories were published in the volumes \"Aufsätze\" (1913) and \"Geschichten\" (1914).\n\nIn 1913, Walser returned to Switzerland. He lived for a short time with his sister Lisa in the mental home in Bellelay, where she worked as a teacher. There, he got to know Lisa Mermet, a washer-woman with whom he developed a close friendship. After a short stay with his father in Biel, he went to live in a mansard in the Biel hotel \"Blaues Kreuz\". In 1914, his father died.\n\nIn Biel, Walser wrote a number of shorter stories that appeared in newspapers and magazines in Germany and Switzerland and selections of which were published in \"Der Spaziergang\" (1917), \"Prosastücke\" (1917), \"Poetenleben\" (1918), \"Seeland\" (1919) and \"Die Rose\" (1925). Walser, who had always been an enthusiastic wanderer, began to take extended walks, often by night. In his stories from that period, texts written from the point of view of a wanderer walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods alternate with playful essays on writers and artists.\n\nDuring World War I, Walser repeatedly had to go into military service. At the end of 1916, his brother Ernst died after a time of mental illness in the Waldau mental home. In 1919, Walser's brother Hermann, geography professor in Bern, committed suicide. Walser himself became isolated in that time, when there was almost no communication with Germany because of the war. Even though he worked hard, he could barely support himself as a freelance writer. At the beginning of 1921, he moved to Bern in order to work at the public record office. He often changed lodgings and lived a very solitary life.\n\nDuring his time in Bern, Walser's style became more radical. In a more and more condensed form, he wrote \"micrograms\" (\"Mikrogramme\"), called thus because of his minuscule pencil hand that is very difficult to decipher. He wrote poems, prose, dramolets and novels, including \"The Robber\" (\"Der Räuber\"). In these texts, his playful, subjective style moved toward a higher abstraction. Many texts of that time work on multiple levels – they can be read as naive-playful feuilletons or as highly complex montages full of allusions. Walser absorbed influences from serious literature as well as from formula fiction and retold, for example, the plot of a pulp novel in a way that the original (the title of which he never revealed) was unrecognizable. Much of his work was written during these very productive years in Bern.\n\nIn the beginning of 1929, Walser, who had suffered from anxieties and hallucinations for quite a time, went to the Bernese mental home Waldau, after a mental breakdown, at his sister Fani's urging. In his medical records it says: \"The patient confessed hearing voices.\" Therefore, this can hardly be called a voluntary commitment. He was eventually diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia. While in the mental home, his state of mind quickly returned to normal, and he went on writing and publishing. More and more, he used the way of writing he called the \"pencil method\": He wrote poems and prose in a diminutive Sütterlin hand, the letters of which measured about a millimeter of height by the end of that very productive phase. Werner Morlang and Bernhard Echte were the first ones who attempted to decipher these writings. In the 1990s, they published a six-volume edition, \"Aus dem Bleistiftgebiet\" ('From the pencil area'). Only when Walser was, against his will, moved to the sanatorium of Herisau in his home canton Appenzell Ausserrhoden, did he quit writing, later telling Carl Seelig, \"I am not here to write, but to be mad.\" Another reason might have been that with the rise of the Nazis in Germany, his works could no longer be published in any case.\n\nIn 1936, his admirer Carl Seelig began to visit him. He later wrote a book, \"Wanderungen mit Robert Walser\", about their talks. Seelig tried to revive interest in Walser's work by re-issuing some of his writings. After the death of Walser's brother Karl in 1943 and of his sister Lisa in 1944, Seelig became Walser's legal guardian. Though free of outward signs of mental illness for a long time, Walser was crotchety and repeatedly refused to leave the sanatorium.\n\nIn 1955, Walser's \"Der Spaziergang\" (\"The Walk\") was translated into English by Christopher Middleton; it was the first English translation of his writing and the only one that would appear during his lifetime. Upon learning of Middleton's translation, Walser, who had fallen out of the public eye, responded by musing \"Well, look at that.\"\n\nWalser loved long, lonely walks. On 25 December 1956 he was found, dead of a heart attack, in a field of snow near the asylum. The photographs of the dead walker in the snow are almost eerily reminiscent of a similar image of a dead man in the snow in Walser's first novel, \"Geschwister Tanner\".\n\nToday, Walser's texts, completely re-edited since the 1970s, are regarded as among the most important writings of literary modernism. In his writing, he made use of elements of Swiss German in a charming and original manner, while very personal observations are interwoven with \"texts about texts\"; that is, with contemplations and variations of other literary works, in which Walser often mixes pulp fiction with high literature.\n\nWalser, who never belonged to a literary school or group, perhaps with the exception of the circle around the magazine \"Die Insel\" in his youth, was a notable and often published writer before World War I and into the 1920s. After the second half of the latter decade, he was rapidly forgotten, in spite of Carl Seelig's editions, which appeared almost exclusively in Switzerland but received little attention.\n\nWalser was only rediscovered in the 1970s, even though famous German writers such as Christian Morgenstern, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, and Hermann Hesse were among his great admirers. Since then, almost all his writings have become accessible through an extensive republication of his entire body of work. He has exerted a considerable influence on various contemporary German writers, including Ror Wolf, Peter Handke, W. G. Sebald, and Max Goldt. In 2004, Spanish writer Enrique Vila-Matas published a novel entitled \"Doctor Pasavento\" about Walser, his stay on Herisau and the wish to disappear. In 2007, Serbian writer Vojislav V. Jovanović published a book of prose named \"Story for Robert Walser\" inspired by the life and work of Robert Walser. In 2012, \"A little ramble: in the spirit of Robert Walser\", a series of artistic responses to Walsers work was published, including work by Moyra Davey, Thomas Schütte, Tacita Dean and Mark Wallinger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first part of the \"Condor Trilogy\" and is followed by \"The Return of the Condor Heroes\" and \"The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\". It was first serialised between 1 January 1957 and 19 May 1959 in \"Hong Kong Commercial Daily\". Jin Yong revised the novel twice, first in the 1970s and later in the 2000s. The English title is imprecise since neither species of the condor, the Andean condor and Californian condor, is native to China. In February 2018, a translation of the first volume (out of four) was published with the title \"A Hero Born\".\n\nThe story is set during the Jin–Song Wars. Yang Tiexin and Guo Xiaotian are sworn brothers and Han patriots who loathe the Jurchen invaders. They pledge that their unborn children will become either sworn siblings (if both are of the same sex) or a married couple (if they are of opposite sexes).\n\nAfter Guo Xiaotian's death and Yang Tiexin's disappearance, Guo Xiaotian's son Guo Jing grows up in Mongolia under the care of Genghis Khan. He learns martial arts from the \"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\" and Ma Yu of the Quanzhen School, as well as archery skills from Jebe. The Chinese title of the novel is derived from an incident in Guo Jing's youth when he shot two eagles with a single arrow. Yang Tiexin's son, Yang Kang, grows up as a Jurchen prince's son. Although he is mentored by Qiu Chuji of the Quanzhen Sect, he also secretly learns the evil \"Nine Yin White Bone Claw\" from Mei Chaofeng.\n\nGuo Jing is honest, loyal and righteous, but slow-witted. Yang Kang is clever, but scheming and treacherous. They eventually meet each other and their respective lovers, Huang Rong and Mu Nianci. The main plot follows Guo Jing and Huang Rong's adventures and their encounters with the Five Greats. Meanwhile, Yang Kang plots with the Jurchens to conquer his native land, the Song dynasty. Yang Kang refuses to acknowledge his Han Chinese ethnicity and is strongly driven to acquire wealth, fame and glory. His treachery is slowly unveiled throughout the novel in the encounters he has with the protagonists.\n\nWith Guo Jing's assistance, the Mongol army conquers the Jin dynasty and subsequently turns its attention towards the Song dynasty. Guo Jing is unwilling to aid the Mongols in attacking his native land so he leaves Mongolia. Guo Jing returns to the Song dynasty and helps his fellow Han Chinese counter the impending Mongol invasion. On the other hand, Yang Kang dies from poisoning after attempting to kill Huang Rong with a palm strike, but ends up hitting her spiked soft armour, which was stained with poison. He leaves behind Mu Nianci and their unborn son, whom Guo Jing named Yang Guo. In the meantime, the Mongol invasion temporarily stops when Genghis Khan dies unexpectedly.\n\nIn 1998, Hong Kong's Ming Ho Press (明河社) published a 38 volume manhua series illustrated by Lee Chi Ching.

After the war, he was appointed as Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick, and supervised the resettlement of Loyalists from the United States in the province. He held this position until his death.\n\nBorn in Strabane, Co. Tyrone, Ireland to Christoper Carleton and his wife Catherine Ball, he was the younger brother of Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. As part of a military family, Thomas joined the British Army at a young age.\n\nIn 1753, he was an ensign in the 20th Regiment of Foot and saw action with his regiment during the Seven Years' War. After the conclusion of the Seven Years' War, Thomas Carleton served as an observer during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774.\n\nIn 1776 during the American Revolutionary War, as a lieutenant colonel, he arrived in Quebec City with forces to relieve his brother, Sir Guy Carleton, the Governor General of Canada, who was besieged in the city by Continental Army troops. With the death of Lt. Col. Patrick Gordon on July 25, 1776, Col. Carleton was promoted to command the 29th Regiment of Foot. In 1777, Thomas Carleton's nephew Christopher Carleton joined the 29th regiment as a major and served under his uncle's command for the rest of the war. Col. Thomas Carleton did not get along well with his new commander, Frederick Haldimand, who replaced Guy Carleton in 1778 as Governor General of Canada. He refused when in 1782 Haldimand demanded that he resign his position as quartermaster general before his planned departure for New York, where his brother Guy had replaced the disgraced Henry Clinton. Thomas Carleton returned to England where he lodged with Lord Shelburne, who at the time was First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of Lords.\n\nIn summer 1784, with the administration of Government safely under Shelburne's colleague Pitt the Younger, Col. Thomas Carleton was appointed as the first Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick. Here, he helped to re-settle the many Loyalists leaving the United States. He was made Major-General in the regular army on 12 October 1793, and colonel commandant of a battalion of the 60th Foot in August 1794.\n\nCarleton saw off a censure motion and attempted ouster by some assemblymen, led by James Glenie, in the closing years of the 18th century; but Glenie had been found guilty in 1780 by a court-martial board, which included Carleton, \"of having behaved unbecoming the Character of an Officer and a Gentleman on many occasions\", and so future events between the two would necessarily have been poisoned.\n\nCarleton would serve as Governor of New Brunswick until his death on February 2, 1817.

After an apprenticeship in that locality he came to London about 1811, and entered himself as a student at Guy's and St. Thomas's hospitals.\n\nHe became a member of the College of Surgeons in 1814, and commenced practice in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, changing his residence soon after to 6 Great Eastcheap. He was chosen a fellow of the Medical Society of London, and became president. He was an admirable speaker.\n\nDendy was not a mere surgeon; he was conspicuous for cultivated taste and polished manners. He published a poem of much merit entitled ‘Zone,’ and the ‘Philosophy of Mystery,’ 1841, a treatise on dreams, spectral illusions, and other imperfect manifestations of the mind. He held some peculiar religious views, but his mind was too much imbued with enthusiasm for him to be a materialist. He was the author of many books, and contributed largely to medical journals, and was the writer of some remarkable papers in the ‘Psychological Journal.’ He was an admirable draughtsman, and illustrated his own works. His last efforts with his pencil were some sketches of the scenes described by the poet Cowper in the neighbourhood of Olney and Weston Underwood. For a long period he acted as senior surgeon to the Royal Infirmary for Children in the Waterloo Road. He was nominated a fellow of the Anthropological Society of London on 2 April 1867, and on 3 Nov. 1868 read a paper on ‘Anthropogenesis’ before the society, which contained a trenchant attack on the Darwinian doctrines. He was retired in his habits, and, with the exception of attending the annual dinner of the Medical Society and the biennial festival of the students of Guy's Hospital, he seldom appeared at any convivial meetings of the profession.\n\nHaving retired from practice, he occupied his time in the reading-room of the British Museum, where his eccentric costume made him a well-known character. After a short illness he died at 25 Suffolk Street, Haymarket, London, on 10 Dec. 1871, aged 77.\n\nHis book On the \"Phenomena of Dreams, and Other Transient Illusions\" (1832), was an early work that attempted to find medical explanations for dreams and psychical experiences.\n\n"}

A critic of HMOs and of the tactics used by insurers, Potter is also an advocate for major reforms of the industry, including universal health care. Prior to his resignation in 2008, Potter was vice president of corporate communications for the health insurance company CIGNA. In June 2009, he testified against the HMO industry in the U.S. Senate to expose health insurance industry practices. He has served as senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity, a fellow at the Center for Media and Democracy, and a consumer liaison representative to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Potter is a regular contributor to \"The Huffington Post\" and Healthinsurance.org.\n\nPotter is in the process of launching his new media venture, Tarbell, a nonprofit news website that will tackle corporate moneyed interests' influence on energy, taxation, politics, and health care.\n\nHe was born on July 16, 1951 to Blaine and Pearl Potter. Raised in Mountain City, Tennessee, Potter was born in Banner Elk, North Carolina. Potter was the first in his family to complete college, graduating from the University of Tennessee, where he edited the student newspaper \"Daily Beacon\" in 1973.\n\nPotter was employed by Humana in Kentucky before moving to Pennsylvania to work for CIGNA in 1993. He began his journey towards resigning and becoming a consumer advocate in July 2007 when he saw a touring free clinic run by Remote Area Medical in rural Virginia:\n\n\"What he saw appalled him. Hundreds of desperate people, most without any medical insurance, descended on the clinic from out of the hills. People queued in long lines to have the most basic medical procedures carried out free of charge. Some had driven more than 200 miles from Georgia. Many were treated in the open air. Potter took pictures of patients lying on trolleys on rain-soaked pavements.\"\nPotter retired from CIGNA in 2008 and became an active voice on health care reform in 2009.\n\nOn September 15, 2009, Potter appeared before the United States House of Representatives Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. Potter said in his opening statement that if Congress \"fails to create a public insurance option to compete with private insurers, the bill it sends to the president might as well be called the Insurance Industry Profit Protection and Enhancement Act.\"\n\nPotter's November 2010 book \"Deadly Spin: An Insurance Company Insider Speaks Out on How Corporate PR Is Killing Health Care and Deceiving Americans\" details much of the industry's deceitful tactics, putting them in historical context by drawing parallels to the tobacco industry and the history of manipulative public relations, gives a history of health reform, and shares his own personal journey.\n\nIn 2013, Potter published an e-book, \"Obamacare: What’s In It For Me? What Everyone Needs to Know About the Affordable Care Act\". The book provides an overview of the consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act and illustrates how the law affects everyday Americans through stories of Potter family members and friends.\n\nIn 2016, Potter published \"Nation on the Take: How Big Money Corrupts Our Democracy And What We Can Do About It\" with co-author Nick Penniman. The book argues that the corrupting influence of big money on U.S. democracy has reached a state of emergency. It details the history of moneyed influences on the U.S. government and makes the case that the situation has grown much worse in recent years, pervading virtually every aspect of American life. The authors also offer solutions citizens can take to repair the damage and make U.S. democracy more responsive to the needs of its people.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the authors, a higher ranking indicates greater historical significance.\n\nSkiena and Ward compared all English Wikipedia articles against five criteria: two that draw on Google page rank, and three that draw on internal Wikipedia metrics: the number of times the page has been viewed, the number of edits to the page, and the size of the page. The concept is that these criteria measure the current fame of the subject. This is then manipulated by other algorithms to compensate for a skewing of data toward more recent subjects, arriving at true likely historical significance. In addition to the main list, various sublists (such as figures of a given field of endeavor or country) are included.\n\nWhile the authors claim that their purely quantitative approach to the question of individual historical significance is a virtue, questions about whether the book is more than \"a lot of fun\" and an \"entertaining exercise\" include doubts whether an individual's historical significance can actually be quantitatively ascertained, how much the book's English sources skew it toward the history of the English-speaking world, whether fame over time is a good measure of significance, and whether attention to a subject in Wikipedia is a good proxy for overall fame.\n\nWhile acknowledging the bias against non-Western figures and disavowing any special authoritativeness, the authors make the case that their methods are both novel and useful – for instance, that historical fame and historical significance are intertwined, that fame over time has qualities in common with the fading or staying power seen in memes, and that Wikipedia metrics provide a window into what people believe matters – and that their approach, with further refinements, may prove useful in other areas. Skiena described: \"We do not answer these questions as historians might, through a principled assessment of their individual achievements. Instead, we evaluate each person by aggregating the traces of millions of opinions in a rigorous and principled manner... We measure meme strength, how successfully is the idea of this person being propagated through time.\"\n\nThe top five entries on the overall list are Jesus, Napoleon, Mohammed, William Shakespeare, and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nRegarding the relative paucity of women on the list (only three of the top 100 figures are women), the authors point out past barriers to women assuming historically significant roles. However, critics have also postulated a bias in the underlying data source, since only 15% of English Wikipedia editors are female. The authors acknowledge this as a potential issue (the authors allow that \"[T]he English-language Wikipedia is inherently culturally biased... The Wikipedia authors did not leave their prejudices at the door, so any results concerning minorities and gender reflect attitudes as well as accomplishments\") and in fact Skiena notes that, statistically speaking, in order to gain a Wikipedia entry a woman has to be somewhat more accomplished than a man. Skiena stated: \"Our methods show that for historical figures from the past 300 years, the average significance of women appearing in Wikipedia was substantially greater than that of the average man. This implies that women required greater credentials to get into Wikipedia, analogous to being about 4 IQ points smarter in the mean. Fortunately, this significance gap has closed and essentially eliminated in modern times.\"\n\n"}
