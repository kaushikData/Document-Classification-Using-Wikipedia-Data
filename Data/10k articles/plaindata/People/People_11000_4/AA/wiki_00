He was also an early psychical researcher known for conducting experiments into table-tipping.\n\nHe was born at Orange, Vaucluse, the son of Adrien de Gasparin. In 1836 he entered the service of his father, then minister of the interior, as chief of a department, became master of requests in the Council of State in 1837, and in 1842 was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from Bastia in Corsica. He was an advocate of religious liberty, prison reform, abolition of slavery, and the rights of the Protestant church, of which he was a member. His independence was not relished by the government, and his sympathy for Protestantism was not shared by his constituents. He was thus voted out of office in 1846, and put all of his enthusiasm into his written work.\n\nWhen the revolution of 1848 took place, he was asked to declare himself in favor of the new constitution. He refused. His disapproval of the form later given to the government by Louis Napoleon was even stronger, and he permanently moved to Switzerland.\n\nFrom 1849 until his death, he lived at Geneva. In the winter, he delivered courses of lectures on economical, historical, and religious subjects, many of which were subsequently published. During the Franco-German War he addressed an appeal to the French people urging them not to persevere in it. His death was hastened by his exertions in the care of refugees from Bourbaki's army, whom he received into his house.\n\nIn 1853, Gasparin with a group of his friends conducted experiments into table-tipping at his home. The experiments were conducted over a period of five months. He recorded the activity of table movements which he believed were the result of a physical force emanating from the bodies of the sitters. He\nproposed a theory of fluidic action (termed \"ectenic force\"), which he believed could explain the phenomena.\n\nProfessor Marc Thury (1822-1905) from the University of Geneva who also attended some of the experiments supported Gasparin's conclusions in a pamphlet in 1855, and conducted some of his own experiments in which similar results were obtained. The physicist and spiritualist William Crookes was influenced by Gasparin's experiments. The experiments were also endorsed by A. Campbell Holms.\n\nCamille Flammarion provided summaries of the work of de Gasparin and Thury. Critics like Frank Podmore argued that the conditions were insufficient to prevent trickery.\n\nThe table-tipping experiments were heavily criticized by Louis Figuier. He noted that Gasperin's claim of the movement of tables without material contact was a \"physical impossibility\" and that he was never able to reproduce the phenomena before the French scientific community. He stated that \"to admit reality of the elevation of a table, without any contact, it would have to be reproduced several times, and at will, in experiences with other observers. This has never arrived; which leads one to conclude that any connivance slipped into the experiments.\"\n\nHe published numerous articles in the \"Journal des Débats\" and the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\". Among his books were:\n\nOn the separation of church and state:\nOn the abolition of slavery:\nOn the reform of home life:\nOn the Franco-German War:\nOther works:\n\nHis biography of Innocent III, \"Vie d'Innocent III\", was published posthumously in 1873.\n\nHis wife, Valérie Boissier de Gasparin, was a noted writer.\n\n\n\n"}

Aquino is a fourth-generation politician and the chairman of the Liberal Party from 2010 to 2016. \n\nOn September 9, 2009, shortly after the death of his mother, Aquino officially announced he would be a candidate in the 2010 presidential election. He was elected and on June 30, 2010 was sworn into office as the fifteenth President of the Philippines at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park, Manila, succeeding Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stepped down at the end of his term on June 30, 2016, succeeded by Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nIn 2013, \"Time\" named him one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2018 Aquino was indicted for budget misuse. \n\nBenigno Simeon \"Noynoy\" Aquino III was born at 10:28 am on February 8, 1960 at Far Eastern University Hospital in Sampaloc, Manila. He is the third of the five children of Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., who was then the Vice Governor of Tarlac province, and Corazon Cojuangco, daughter of a prominent Tarlac businessman. He has four sisters, namely: Maria Elena (Ballsy), Aurora Corazon (Pinky), Victoria Elisa (Viel), and Kristina Bernadette (Kris). He attended Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City for his elementary, high school, and college education. Aquino finished his Bachelor of Arts (major in economics) from Ateneo de Manila University in 1981, He was one of the students of former professor of economics at Ateneo de Manila University, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nHe joined his family in their exile in the United States shortly thereafter. He returned to the Philippines in 1983 shortly after the assassination of his father and held several positions working in the private sector. In September 1972, Aquino's father, who was then a senator and prominent opposition leader to President Ferdinand Marcos, was arrested for subversion. In August 1973, Aquino's father was brought before a military tribunal in Fort Bonifacio. \n\nIn 1980, after a series of heart attacks, Aquino's father was allowed to seek medical treatment in the United States, where Aquino's family began a period of self-exile. In 1981, shortly after graduation, Aquino joined his family in the United States.\n\nIn 1983, after three years in exile in the United States, Aquino's family returned to the Philippines, shortly after the assassination of his father on August 21, 1983. He had a short tenure as a member of the Philippine Business for Social Progress, working as an assistant of the executive director of PBSP. He later joined Mondragon Industries Philippines, Inc. as an assistant Retail Sales Supervisor and assistant promotions manager for Nike Philippines, Inc.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1992, during the presidency of his mother, Aquino joined the Intra-Strata Assurance Corporation, a company owned by his uncle Antolin Oreta Jr., as vice president.\n\nOn August 28, 1987, eighteen months into the presidency of Aquino's mother, rebel soldiers led by Gregorio Honasan staged an unsuccessful coup attempt, attempting to lay siege to Malacañang Palace. Aquino was two blocks from the palace when he came under fire. Three of Aquino's four security escorts were killed, and the last was wounded protecting him. He himself was hit by five bullets, one of which is still embedded in his neck.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1998, he worked for Central Azucarera de Tarlac, the sugar refinery in the Cojuangco-owned Hacienda Luisita. He was employed as the executive assistant for administration from 1993 to 1996 and subsequently worked as manager for field services from 1996 to 1998.\n\nIn 1998, he was elected to the House of Representatives as Representative of the 2nd district of Tarlac province. He was subsequently re-elected to the House in 2001 and 2004. In 2007, having been barred from running for re-election to the House due to term limits, he was elected to the Senate in the 14th Congress of the Philippines.\n\nAquino is a fourth-generation politician: his great-grandfather, Servillano \"Mianong\" Aquino, served as a delegate to the Malolos Congress; his paternal grandfather, Benigno Aquino, Sr., served as Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from 1943 to 1944; his maternal grandfather, Jose Cojuangco, was also a member of the House of Representatives; and his parents were Corazon Aquino, who served as the 11th President of the Philippines (1986–92), and Senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr. Aquino is a member of the Liberal Party, where he held various positions such as Secretary General and Vice President for Luzon.\n\nAquino became Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives on November 8, 2004, but relinquished the post on February 21, 2006, when Aquino joined his Liberal Party members in calling for the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo at the height of the Hello Garci scandal.\n\nAquino was also Chairman of the Board of the Central Luzon Congressional Caucus.\n\nBarred from running for re-election to the House of Representatives of the Philippines, to represent the 2nd district of Tarlac, due to term limits, Aquino was elected to the Senate of the Philippines in the 2007 Philippine midterm election on May 15, 2007, under the banner of the Genuine Opposition (GO), a coalition comprising a number of parties, including Aquino's own Liberal Party, seeking to curb attempts by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to amend the 1986 Philippine Constitution. In Aquino's political ads, he was endorsed by his younger sister, TV host Kris Aquino, and his mother, the late former President Corazon Aquino. Although a Roman Catholic, Aquino was endorsed by the pentecostal Jesus Is Lord Church, one of the largest Protestant churches in the Philippines. With more than votes, Aquino's tally was the sixth highest of the 37 candidates for the 12 vacant seats elected from the nation at large. Aquino assumed his new office on June 30, 2007.\n\nDuring the campaign, Aquino reached out to his former enemy, Senator Gregorio Honasan, supporting his application for bail. Aquino told Job Tabada of Cebu Daily News, on March 5, 2007;\n\nAquino was referring to an unsuccessful coup attempt staged by rebel soldiers led by Gregorio Honasan on August 28, 1987, in which Aquino was seriously injured.\n\nThe Budget Impoundment and Control Act (SB 3121), wherein \"impoundment\" refers to the power of the president to refuse the release of funds appropriated by the Congress of the Philippines, is another bill Aquino is proud of; he regretted, however, that such power has been used and abused by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, a result of which abuse has been the significant emasculation of Congress' ability to check the president's authority. Aquino filed this bill so the president would have to pass through Congress every time the president decides to impound part of the budget.\n\nAnother significant Aquino contribution to the Philippines' corruption problem was Senate Bill 2035, which is the \"Preservation of Public Infrastructures\" bill, seeking to raise standards in the construction of all public infrastructures by penalizing contractors of defective infrastructures. The bill also requires the Bureau of Maintenance under the Department of Public Works and Highways to conduct periodic inspections of public infrastructures.\n\nAquino also pushed for the passage of the Amending the Government Procurement Act (SB 2160), which applies to all government procurement activities regardless of source of funds whether local or foreign; only treaties or international/executive agreements entered into by the government prior to its enactment shall be exempt from coverage. The bill was filed in light of the Department of Justice declaration regarding the validity of the controversial NBN-ZTE scandal, wherein its international aspect, as well as the fact that it was an executive agreement, was cited as one reason for its exemption from the procurement process stipulated in Republic Act 9184.\n\nFocusing further on accountability in government appropriations and spending, Aquino filed other reform-oriented bills, among which were Philippine National Police reform; an increase in penalties for corporations and work establishments not compliant with minimum wage; the banning of reappointment to the Judicial and Bar Council; the prevention of reappointment and bypassing of the Commission on Appointments; real property valuation based on international standards; and superior responsibility for senior military officers, who are ultimately responsible for their own subordinates. However, none of these bills were passed into law.\n\nOn November 26, 2008, the Liberal Party elected Mar Roxas, president of the Liberal Party, as the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party for President of the Philippines in the then-upcoming 2010 presidential elections.\n\nFollowing the death and funeral of Aquino's mother, former President Corazon Aquino, many people began calling on Aquino to run for President of the Philippines. This groundswell of support became known as the \"Noynoy Phenomenon\".\n\nOn August 27, 2009, Edgardo \"Eddie\" Roces, son of the late Chino Roces, former publisher and owner of \"The Manila Times\", and a group of lawyers and activists formed the Noynoy Aquino for President Movement (NAPM), a nationwide campaign to collect a million signatures in order to persuade Aquino to run for president, reminiscent of Roces' father, who on October 15, 1985, launched the Cory Aquino for President Movement (CAPM), collecting more than one million signatures nationwide, asking Aquino's mother to run against Ferdinand Marcos in the 1986 presidential snap elections.\n\nIn September 2009, the Liberal Party held numerous press conferences in relation to the 2010 elections at the Club Filipino in Greenhills, San Juan, the site of the presidential inauguration of Aquino's mother in February 1986.\n\nOn September 1, 2009, at the Club Filipino, in a press conference, Senator Mar Roxas, president of the Liberal Party, announced his withdrawal from the 2010 presidential race and expressed his support for Aquino, as the party standard-bearer instead. Aquino later stood side by side with Roxas, but did not make a public statement at the press conference. The next day, Aquino announced that he would be going on a \"spiritual retreat\" over the weekend to finalize his decision for the elections, visiting the Carmelite sisters in Zamboanga City. reminiscent of his mother's own soul-searching in 1985 before deciding to run for the elections the following year. He came back on September 9 to formally announce his candidacy. Almost two weeks later, Roxas pledged to run alongside Aquino as the Liberal Party standard-bearer for vice-president. The two men filed their respective certificates of candidacy for president and vice-president on November 28, 2009.\n\nFake psychiatric reports on Aquino's mental health began circulating online during the 90-day election campaign period from February 9 – May 8, 2010, Aquino received information that the first such report came from the wife of Nacionalista Party supporter and former National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) president Guido Delgado, a move Aquino claims was made with \"malicious intent\". A second report came from an unidentified supporter of Senator Manny Villar, the Nacionalistas' leader and presidential candidate. Later presented by Delgado at a press conference, the psychiatric report was supposedly signed by Father Jaime C. Bulatao, S.J., PhD, a Jesuit priest, a professor of Psychology and a clinical psychologist at the Ateneo de Manila University, taken when Aquino was finishing his Bachelor's degree in economics at the university in 1979. It reportedly showed that Aquino suffered from depression and melancholia, the priest later denied writing the document at all. Another supposed psychiatric report that later surfaced claimed that Aquino suffered from major depressive disorder; the report's supposed author, Jesuit priest Father Carmelo A. Caluag II, denied writing any evaluations of Aquino. The university's psychology department later debunked the documents, with Aquino labelling them as another desperate effort by rivals to malign his reputation.\nDuring the campaign, Senator Francis Escudero began endorsing Aquino as president and PDP-Laban standard-bearer Jejomar Binay, for Vice President, launching the Aquino-Binay campaign. However, this was done without the consent of the two candidates; Binay was former President Joseph Estrada's running mate for vice-president.\n\nDuring the 2010 presidential election, held on May 10, 2010, in unofficial tallies, conducted by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), Aquino was the leading candidate in tallied votes for president, and in the official Congressional canvass, Aquino was the leading candidate in canvassed votes for president. Aquino was unofficially being referred to as \"president-apparent\" by the media.\n\nOn June 9, 2010, at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, in Quezon City, the Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Aquino as the President-elect of the Philippines, following the 2010 election with 15,208,678 votes, while Jejomar Binay, the former mayor of Makati City, was proclaimed as the Vice President-elect of the Philippines with 14,645,574 votes, defeating runner-up for the vice presidency Mar Roxas, the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party for vice president.\n\nThe Presidency of Benigno S. Aquino III began at noon on June 30, 2010, when he became the fifteenth President of the Philippines, succeeding Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Since the start of his presidency, he has also been referred to in the media as PNoy.\n\nThe presidential transition began on June 9, 2010, when the Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Aquino the winner of the 2010 Philippine presidential elections held on May 10, 2010, proclaiming Aquino as the President-elect of the Philippines. The transition was in charge of the new presidential residence, cabinet appointments and cordial meetings between them and the outgoing administration.\nThe presidential residence of Aquino is \"Bahay Pangarap\" (English: House of Dreams), located inside of Malacañang Park, at the headquarters of the Presidential Security Group across the Pasig River from Malacañang Palace. Aquino is the first president to make \"Bahay Pangarap\" his official residence. Malacañang Park was intended as a recreational retreat by former President Manuel L. Quezon. The house was built and designed by architect Juan Arellano in the 1930s, and underwent a number of renovations. In 2008, the house was demolished and rebuilt in contemporary style by architect Conrad Onglao, a new swimming pool was built, replacing the Commonwealth-era swimming pool. The house originally had one bedroom, however, the house was renovated for Aquino to have four bedrooms, a guest room, a room for Aquino's household staff, and a room for Aquino's close-in security. The house was originally intended as a rest house, the venue for informal activities and social functions for the First Family by former President Manuel L. Quezon. Malacañang Park was refurbished through the efforts of First Lady Eva Macapagal, wife of former President Diosdado Macapagal, in the early 1960s. First Lady Macapagal renamed the rest house as \"Bahay Pangarap\". During the presidency of Fidel V. Ramos, the house was restored and became the club house of the Malacañang Golf Club. The house was used by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to welcome special guests. Aquino refused to live in Malacañang Palace, the official residence of the President of the Philippines, or in Arlegui Mansion, the residence of former presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos, stating that the two residences are too big, and also stated that his small family residence at Times Street in Quezon City would be impractical, since it would be a security concern for his neighbors.\nOn June 29, 2010, Aquino officially named the members of his Cabinet, with Aquino himself as Secretary of the Interior and Local Government, a position that Vice President-elect Jejomar Binay initially wanted; however, Aquino stated that the post was not being considered for him. He instead offered Binay various positions, such as head of a commission to investigate the outgoing Arroyo administration, the posts of Secretary of Agrarian Reform, chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), and the chairman of Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), but Binay refused. Aquino also announced the formation of a truth commission that will investigate various issues including corruption allegations against outgoing President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Aquino named former Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. to head the truth commission.\n\nTraditionally, it is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines who administers the oath of office to the incoming president and vice president, however, Aquino refused to allow Chief Justice Renato Corona to swear him into office, due to Aquino's opposition to the midnight appointment of Corona by outgoing President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on May 12, 2010, two days after the 2010 elections and a month before Arroyo's term expired. Instead, Aquino formally requested Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Conchita Carpio-Morales, who opposed the midnight appointment of Corona, to swear him into office.\n\nAquino took the oath of office on June 30, 2010, at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park, Manila. The oath of office was administered by Associate Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales, who officially accepted Aquino's request to swear him into office, reminiscent of the decision of his mother, who in 1986, was sworn into the presidency by Associate Justice Claudio Teehankee. After being sworn in as the fifteenth President of the Philippines, succeeding Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Aquino delivered his .\n\nDuring the inaugural address, Aquino created the \"no \"wang-wang\"\" policy, strengthening the implementation of Presidential Decree No. 96. The term \"‘wang-wang’\" is street lingo for blaring sirens. Presidential Decree No. 96 was issued on January 13, 1973 by former President Ferdinand Marcos, regulating the use of sirens, bells, whistles, horns and other similar devices only to motor vehicles designated for the use of the president, vice president, senate president, House Speaker, chief justice, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines, National Bureau of Investigation, Land Transportation Office, Bureau of Fire Protection and ambulances. However, despite having the privilege of using \"‘wang-wang’\", Aquino maintained he would set the example for his no \"‘wang-wang’\" policy, not to use \"‘wang-wang’\", even if it means being stuck in traffic and being late every now and then. Aquino also traded the official black presidential Mercedes Benz S-Guard limousine for his own white Toyota Land Cruiser 200. After the inaugural address, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority began to enforce Aquino's no \"‘wang-wang’\" policy, confiscating \"‘wang-wang’\" from public officials and private motorists who illegally used them.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, at the Batasang Pambansa, in Quezon City, Aquino delivered his (SONA). During Aquino's first State of the Nation Address (SONA), Aquino announced his intention to reform the education system in the Philippines by shifting to K–12 education, a 12-year basic education cycle. K–12 education is used in the United States, Canada, and Australia. On July 29, 2015, Aquino delivered his final SONA address, where he discussed the country's economic improvements and the benefits of social service programs, particularly the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, during the course of his presidency.\n\nOn August 23, 2010, in front of the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park, Manila, the site of Aquino's presidential inauguration, the Manila hostage crisis occurred. Aquino expressed concern over the matter and gave his condolences to the victims. Aquino defended the actions of the police at the scene, stating that the gunman had not shown any signs of wanting to kill the hostages. Aquino ordered a \"thorough investigation\" into the incident, and would wait until it is completed before deciding whether anyone should lose his or her job. Aquino declared that the media may have worsened the situation by giving the gunman \"a bird's-eye view of the entire situation\". Aquino also made reference to the Moscow theater hostage crisis, which, according to Aquino, resulted in \"more severe\" casualties despite Russia's \"resources and sophistication\". On August 24, 2010, Aquino signed Proclamation No. 23, declaring August 25, 2010, as a national day of mourning, instructing all public institutions nationwide and all Philippine embassies and consulates overseas to lower the Philippine flag at half-mast, in honor of the eight Hong Kong residents who died in the crisis. On August 25, 2010, at a press conference in Malacañang, Aquino apologized to those offended when he was caught on television apparently smiling while being interviewed at the crime scene hours after the Manila hostage crisis. Aquino said;\n\nOn September 3, 2010, Aquino took responsibility for the crisis. Aquino actually has direct supervision of the Philippine National Police, since Aquino had asked Secretary of the Interior and Local Government Jesse Robredo to address other concerns, such as coming up with a comprehensive plan on delivering social services to and relocating informal settlers in coordination with the local governments.\n\nPresident Aquino's administration was criticised during and after Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in November 2013 for the government's \"slow\" response to aid the victims. This criticism resulted in countries like Canada to provide humanitarian aid to the victims of the typhoon through non-governmental organizations and not the Philippine government, wherein the Canadian Ambassador to the Philippines, Neil Reeder cited \"the speed, because of the need to move quickly, and because we don’t, as a government, want to be involved in the details, nor do we think it’s efficient to have other governments involved.\"\n\nPresident Aquino was accused of evading responsibility for the death of 44 Special Action Force operatives in a failed operation, which led to the so-called Mamasapano massacre.\n\n\"Noynoying\" (pronounced noy-noy-YING or noy-NOY-ying) is a protest tactic in the form of a neologism that Aquino's critics have used to question his work ethic, alleging his inaction on the issues of disaster response and rising oil prices. A play on the term planking and Aquino's nickname, Noynoying involves posing in a lazy manner, such as sitting idly while resting his head on one hand, and doing nothing.\n\nAquino appointed the following to the Supreme Court of the Philippines:\n\nFollowing the turnover ceremonies to his successor Rodrigo Duterte at Malacañang, Aquino returned to his parents' residence along Times Street, Quezon City. Since leaving office, Aquino remained silent on the Duterte administration and rarely made public appearances. However, in November 2016, Aquino attended a concert at Rizal Park and joined protests against the burial of Ferdinand Marcos. In February 2017, Aquino commemorated the 31st anniversary of the People Power Revolution by marching to the People Power Monument and joining the protests against the Ferdinand Marcos regime.\n\nIn July 2017, criminal charges were filed against Aquino for usurpation of authority under the Revised Penal Code and violating anti-graft and corruption laws.

In 1969, he co-founded the Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation in New York, which opened six branches as well as a treatment centre in Brooklyn. A major project of the A. R. T.

She has frequently appeared in comedies throughout her career, while also earning critical recognition in dramatic films. Her accolades include four Golden Globe Award nominations, three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and a New York Film Critics Award. In 2013, she was named the highest-paid actress over 40 in Hollywood. , the U.S. domestic box office grosses of Diaz's films total over $3 billion USD, with worldwide grosses surpassing $7 billion, making her the fifth highest-grossing U.S. domestic box office actress.\n\nBorn in San Diego, California, Diaz was raised in Long Beach. While still in high school, she signed a modeling contract with Elite Model Management. She made her film debut at age 21 opposite Jim Carrey in the comedy \"The Mask\" (1994). She was subsequently cast in a supporting role in \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" (1996) before appearing as the titular Mary in the Farrelly brothers' hit comedy \"There's Something About Mary\" (1998), which brought her increased notoriety and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Lead Actress. Her following two projectsthe sports drama \"Any Given Sunday\", and Spike Jonze's surrealist fantasy \"Being John Malkovich\" (both 1999)lent Diaz a reputation as a dramatic actress, the latter earning her her second Golden Globe nomination.\n\nDiaz earned a third Golden Globe nomination for her supporting role in \"Vanilla Sky\" (2001), and appeared in numerous high-profile films in the early 2000s, including \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000) and its sequel \"\" (2003), as well as voicing the character of Princess Fiona in the \"Shrek\" series (2001–2010). In 2003, she was cast in Martin Scorsese's period epic \"Gangs of New York\", for which she earned her fourth Golden Globe nomination. Her subsequent films included the dramatic comedies \"In Her Shoes\" (2005) and \"The Holiday\" (2006), and the psychological thriller \"The Box\" (2009). Diaz appeared in supporting parts in \"The Green Hornet\" in 2011, followed by starring roles in the comedies \"The Other Woman\" and \"Sex Tape\" (both 2014).\n\nAfter appearing in Will Gluck's 2014 film adaptation of \"Annie\", Diaz confirmed she was formally retiring from acting. Diaz is the author of two health books: \"The Body Book\" (2013), a \"New York Times\" bestseller, and \"The Longevity Book\" (2016).\n\nCameron Michelle Diaz was born August 30, 1972 in San Diego, California to Billie (née Early), an import/export agent, and Emilio Diaz ( 2008), a foreman of the California oil company Unocal. Diaz has an elder sister, Chimene. Her father's family is Cuban, and Diaz's ancestors had originally moved from Spain to Cuba. Later they settled in Ybor City, Tampa, before moving to California, where her father was born. Her mother has predominantly English and German ancestry.\n\nDiaz was raised in Long Beach and attended Los Cerritos Elementary School, and then Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where she was a classmate of Snoop Dogg. She recalled her upbringing as frugal, stating: \"I had amazing parents, they were awesome. We weren't privilegedvery much the opposite. My family would collect [soda] cans to turn in for extra money, because $20 meant something to us. But we were very happy.\"\n\nWhile still attending high school, Diaz signed a modeling contract with Elite Model Management at age 16, and appeared in advertisements for Calvin Klein and Levi's. The following year, at age 17, she was featured on the cover of the July 1990 issue of \"Seventeen\" magazine. Diaz also modeled for 2 to 3 months in Australia and shot a commercial for Coca-Cola in Sydney in 1991.\n\nIn 1992, at age 19, she was photographed and videotaped topless for an S&M leather fashion lingerie editorial by John Rutter, photographer, and Clifford Wright, as producer for an editorial for Max Magazine Italy. They were never released. Rutter approached Diaz in 2003, ahead of the release of \"\", offering to sell the pictures and video to her for $3.5 million before attempting to sell them to prospective buyers. He stated that he was offering her first right of refusal to them; she saw it as attempted blackmail and sued him. In July 2004, the 30-minute video of the photoshoot, entitled \"She's No Angel\", was released on a Russian website. Rutter denied releasing it. On July 26, 2005, Rutter was convicted of attempted grand theft, forgery, and perjury. On September 16, 2005, Rutter was sentenced to more than three years in prison.\n\nAt the age of 21, Diaz auditioned for \"The Mask\" playing the sultry jazz singer Tina Carlyle, based on the recommendation of an agent for Elite, who met the film's producers while they were searching for the lead actress. Having no previous acting experience, she started acting lessons after being cast. \"The Mask\" became one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1994 and launched Diaz as a sex symbol. During this period, Diaz dated video producer Carlos de la Torre.\n\nDiaz subsequently starred in the independent black comedy \"The Last Supper\" (1995), playing one of several liberal graduate students who invite a group of extremist conservatives to a dinner to murder them. Roger Ebert deemed the film \"a brave effort in a timid time, a Swiftian attempt to slap us all in the face and get us to admit that our own freedoms depend precisely on those of our neighbors, our opponents and, yes, our enemies.\" She then had a lead role as an ex-stripper in the dramatic comedy \"Feeling Minnesota\" (1996), in which she co-starred opposite Keanu Reeves, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Courtney Love. Emanuel Levy of \"Variety\" noted: \"Sadly, with the notable exception of the attractive Diaz, who’s well cast as the sexual aggressor and romantic manipulator, there are no exciting performances in the film.\" The same year, she was cast opposite Jennifer Aniston in the Edward Burns-directed comedy \"She's the One\" (1996), followed by a starring role in \"Head Above Water\" (1996), a crime-comedy in which she played an unfaithful wife implicated in her ex-lover's murder.\n\nShe was scheduled to perform in the film \"Mortal Kombat\", but had to resign after breaking her hand while training for the role. Besides a starring part in the little-seen \"A Life Less Ordinary\", Diaz returned to mainstream in 1997 with the romantic comedy \"My Best Friend's Wedding\". In it, she starred opposite Julia Roberts, playing the wealthy fiancée of a sportswriter who is the long-time friend of Roberts' character. The film was a global box-office hit and is considered as one of the best romantic comedy films of all time.\n\nIn 1998, Diaz starred in \"There's Something About Mary\", as the titular role of a woman living in Miami having several men vying for her affections. It was remarked in \"The Austin Chronicle\": \"As the Mary at the center of it all, Diaz certainly exudes that irresistible \"something\" expressed in the title. In films such as \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" and \"A Life Less Ordinary\", Diaz has shown herself to be a good comic sport who is game for just about anything. Here, it's no stretch to understand why, at the end of the movie, some half-dozen suitors have converged in her living room to throw themselves at her feet\". The sleeper hit was the highest-grossing comedy of 1998 in North America as well as the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year; it made US$176 million in the United States and US$369 million worldwide. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress – Musical or Comedy. Diaz also starred in the critically panned comedy \"Very Bad Things\" (1998).\n\nAfter appearing in \"There's Something About Mary\", Diaz briefly dated her co-star Matt Dillon. The following year, she began a four-year relationship with actor Jared Leto, which ended in 2003.\n\nShe starred in Spike Jonze's directorial debut \"Being John Malkovich\" (1999), portraying the pet-obsessed wife of an unemployed puppeteer who, through a portal, finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich. The film received widespread acclaim and was an arthouse success. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" concluded that Diaz \"does a hilarious turn\" in her \"frumpy wife\" role, and Roger Ebert felt that the actress, \"one of the best-looking women in movies, [...] here looks so dowdy we hardly recognize her [...] Diaz has fun with her talent by taking it incognito to strange places and making it work for a living\". For her role, Diaz earned Best Supporting Actress nominations at the Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG Awards. Her next film release in 1999 was Oliver Stone's sports drama \"Any Given Sunday\", where she played a young team owner who a veteran coach (Al Pacino) has fallen out of favor with. While critical response was mixed, the film made US$100 million globally.\n\nIn the film adaptation \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu played the trio of investigators in Los Angeles. The film was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, grossing US$264.1 million. In 2001, Diaz starred in the Sundance-premiered independent drama \"The Invisible Circus\", as a young woman who commits suicide in Europe in the 1970s, and next in the year, she appeared in \"Vanilla Sky\", as the former lover of a self-indulgent and vain publishing magnate (Tom Cruise). A wide critical response and commercial success greeted \"Vanilla Sky\" upon its release; \"Los Angeles Times\" called her \"compelling as the embodiment of crazed sensuality\" and \"The New York Times\" said she gives a \"ferociously emotional\" performance. \"San Francisco Chronicle\" similarly stated of the film, \"most impressive is Cameron Diaz, whose fatal-attraction stalker is both heartbreaking and terrifying.\" She earned nominations for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globe Awards, the SAG Awards, the Critics' Choice Awards, and the American Film Institute Awards for her performance in the film.\nAlso in 2001, she voiced Princess Fiona in the animated film \"Shrek\". In the film, her character is plagued by a curse that transforms her into an ogress each and every sunset. Locked in a dragon-guarded castle for several years, she is rescued by the title character, whom she later comes to love. The film was a major commercial success, grossing US$484.4 million worldwide. In 2002, Diaz headlined the romantic comedy \"The Sweetest Thing\", playing a single woman educating herself on wooing the opposite sex when she finally meets the man of her dreams. The film was a moderate commercial success with a global gross of US$68.6 million.\n\nAfter completing \"Shrek\", Diaz starred in Martin Scorsese's epic period drama \"Gangs of New York\", set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City; she took on the role of a pickpocket-grifter and the love interest of Leonardo DiCaprio's character. Worldwide, the film grossed a total of US$193 million, while it was embraced by critics. A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\", agreeing with other top critics on co-star Daniel Day Lewis's presence overshadowing Diaz and DiCaprio, felt that the actress \"ends up with no outlet for her spitfire energies, since her character is more a structural necessity — the linchpin of male jealousy — than a fully imagined person. The limitations of her role point to a more serious lapse, which is the movie's lack of curiosity about what women's lives might have been like in Old New York\". Diaz next reprised her roles in the commercially successful sequels \"\" (2003), and \"Shrek 2\" (2004). Beginning in 2003, it was reported that Diaz began dating singer and actor Justin Timberlake.\n\nDiaz received substantial defamation damages from suing American Media Incorporated, after the \"National Enquirer\" posted an article and pictures with the headline \"Cameron Caught Cheating\" on their website in May 2005. The photos claimed to show Diaz cheating on her boyfriend of the time, Timberlake, with the married MTV producer of her show \"Trippin'\", Shane Nickerson. After Diaz complained, the article and pictures were removed from the web and the hard copy did not contain any of the content. The magazine apologized to Diaz, Timberlake, Nickerson and his wife for the distress caused and said the story was untrue and the picture showed no more than a goodbye hug between friends.\nIn her following film, Diaz played opposite Toni Collette and Shirley MacLaine in \"In Her Shoes\" (2005), a comedy-drama film based on the novel of the same name by Jennifer Weiner, which focuses on the relationship between two sisters and their grandmother. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and Diaz garnered acclaim for her performance of a dyslectic wild child engaged in a love-hate struggle with her plain, sensible sister (Collette), with \"USA Today\" calling it \"her best work\" at the time. She followed \"In Her Shoes\" with a role in Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy \"The Holiday\" (2006), also starring Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black. In it she played Amanda, an American movie trailer producer who arranges a home exchange with a British woman (Winslet). The film became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year, grossing more than $205 million worldwide.\n\nIn January 2007, it was reported that Diaz and Timberlake had separated after four years together. Diaz's only film of 2007 was \"Shrek the Third\", the third installment in the \"Shrek\" franchise. Although the film was met with mixed reviews from critics, it grossed $798 million worldwide. The same year, Diaz also voiced Princess Fiona in a thirty-minute Christmas special, directed by Gary Trousdale. Diaz earned an estimated $50 million during the period of a year ending June 2008, for her roles in the \"Shrek\" sequel and her next film \"What Happens in Vegas\" opposite Ashton Kutcher. A romantic comedy by Tom Vaughan, Diaz and Kutcher portrayed two strangers who awaken together to discover they have gotten married following a night in which they won a huge jackpot after playing the other's quarter. Critic reviews were negative but the film still grossed $219 million with a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn 2009, she starred in \"My Sister's Keeper\" and \"The Box\". Based on Jodi Picoult's novel of the same name, \"My Sister's Keeper\" was released to mixed reviews in June 2009. In the drama, Diaz plays a former lawyer and mother of three, one of whom is dying of leukemia. A moderate commercial success, it grossed $95 million worldwide, mostly from its domestic run. Set in 1976, \"The Box\", written and directed by Richard Kelly, stars Diaz and James Marsden as a couple who receive a box from a mysterious man who offers them one million dollars if they press the button sealed within the dome on top of a box, knowing that someone, somewhere, will die from it. Critical response towards the psychological horror film was mixed, and, though having grossed its budget back, was considered a financial disappointment.\n\nIn 2010, \"Forbes\" ranked Diaz as the richest female celebrity, ranking her number 60 among the wealthiest 100. Also that year, Diaz reprised her voice role of Princess Fiona in \"Shrek Forever After\", the fourth installment in the \"Shrek\" series. Although the film opened to mixed reviews from critics, it grossed a worldwide total of over $752 million and became the fifth top-grossing films released that year. Also in 2010, Diaz reunited with her \"Vanilla Sky\" co-star Tom Cruise in the action comedy film \"Knight and Day\". In it, Diaz plays a classic car restorer who unwittingly gets caught up with the eccentric secret agent Roy Miller, played by Cruise, who is on the run from the Secret Service. \"Knight and Day\" received mixed reviews, and while the comedy performed poorly at the box office in its debut, it became a sleeper hit at the box office with a worldwide gross of US$262 million. Beginning in May 2010, Diaz began dating former New York Yankees player Alex Rodriguez. Their relationship ended in September 2011.\n\nIn 2011, Diaz was cast as Lenore Case, a journalist, in the remake of the 1940s film \"The Green Hornet\". Directed by Michel Gondry, Diaz starred alongside Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, and Christoph Waltz in the superhero action comedy film. Released to mixed to negative reviews from critics, who called it an \"overblown, interminable and unfunny update\", the film ended its theatrical run on April 21, 2011, with a worldwide gross total of $228 million. The same year, she played opposite Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel in Jake Kasdan's adult comedy \"Bad Teacher\". In the film, Diaz plays an immoral, gold-digging Chicago-area middle school teacher at the fictional John Adams Middle School who curses at her students, drinks heavily, and smokes marijuana. Again, it received mostly negative reviews from critics who felt that \"in spite of a promising concept and a charmingly brazen performance from Diaz, \"Bad Teacher\" is never as funny as it should be.\" A commercial hit however, the R-rated comedy grossed US$216 million worldwide. Also in 2011, Diaz was listed among \"CEOWorld Magazine\"s Top Accomplished Women Entertainers.\n\nIn 2012, Diaz was cast in \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\", directed by Kirk Jones and based on the pregnancy guide of the same name. Diaz, who filmed her scenes in a two-week period, portrays Jules Baxer, a contestant on a celebrity dance show and a host to a weight-loss fitness show, who becomes pregnant with her dance partner's baby. Upon release, the ensemble comedy received mostly negative reviews, but became a moderate commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$84.4 million. Diaz's other film that year was \"Gambit\", a remake of the 1966 film of the same name directed by Michael Hoffman and scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews, and performed poorly at the box office, grossing only $10 million internationally. Diaz also voiced Sigmund Freud in \"\" (2012), a British animated comedy film that is a completely inaccurate portrayal of the life of Monty Python alumnus Graham Chapman.\n\nDiaz's only film project of 2013 was Ridley Scott's \"The Counselor\", co-starring Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz and Brad Pitt. In the thriller about greed, death, the primal instincts of humans and their consequences, Diaz plays a pathological liar and a sociopath, an immigrant who is now living the high-life after escaping a sordid past as an exotic dancer. While the film's reception was negative, her performance was praised as one of her best in recent years.\n\nDiaz's first film of 2014 was the romantic revenge comedy \"The Other Woman\" opposite Leslie Mann and Kate Upton. While \"The Other Woman\" received mostly negative reviews from critics, who felt that it settled for cheap laughs, it opened atop the US weekend box office with earnings of US$24.7 million across the three days; it eventually made US$83.9 million in North America and US$196.7 million globally.\n\nHer next film release in 2014 was the comedy \"Sex Tape\", in which she starred with Jason Segel as a married couple waking up to discover that a sex tape they had made went missing, leading to a frantic search for its whereabouts. Although the negative-reviewed film \"flopped\" at the domestic box office, it ultimately became a moderate commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$126 million. The role required Diaz to perform multiple scenes of nudity. On her decision to appear nude, Diaz said: \"People have seen my butt. I've shown the top of my butt, the bottom of my butt. I'm not opposed to doing nudity, as long as it's part of the story. I'll do whatever has to get done if it's the right thing.\" Her last 2014 release was the film adaptation \"Annie\", co-starring Quvenzhané Wallis, Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne. She took on the role of Miss Colleen Hannigan, the cruel control freak of the foster home where the titular character resides. Upon its December premiere, \"Annie\" made US$133 million worldwide, with Diaz's performance garnering polarized reviews; critics praising her effort, but ultimately calling it too \"vampy\", as well as \"strident and obnoxious\". Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" says that she \"overacts the role to the point of hysteria\". Diaz took a hiatus from film acting after the release of \"Annie\", stating in July 2017 that she was tired of traveling for filming, and confirmed the following March she had retired from acting.\n\nIn late 2013, she published a health book, \"\", co-written with Sandra Bark. It was no. 2 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in March 2014. She then released \"The Longevity Book: The Science of Aging, the Biology of Strength, and the Privilege of Time\" in June 2016.\n\nDiaz married musician Benji Madden at her home in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, 2015 in a Jewish ceremony. It took place after a 17-day engagement, having been introduced seven months earlier by her close friend and now sister-in-law, Nicole Richie.\n\nDiaz publicly endorsed Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election. Known for her environmental activism, she is an early adopter of the Prius hybrid car and worked to promote Gore's Live Earth campaign, raising awareness of climate change. Diaz wore a T-shirt that read \"I won't vote for a son of a Bush!\" while making publicity visits for \"Charlie's Angels\".\n\nDiaz has been involved with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), the first and largest nonprofit organization for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has spoken as an advocate for military families.\n\n"}

He is the 42nd and current lieutenant governor of Texas, serving since January 2015.\n\nOriginally from Baltimore, Maryland, Patrick began his career as a radio and television broadcaster. After forming a chain of sports bars and subsequently going bankrupt, he became a radio host again, this time becoming a conservative commentator. From 2007 to 2015, Patrick was a Republican member of the Texas Senate for the 7th District, which included a small portion of the city of Houston and several Houston-area suburbs located mostly in northwest Harris County.\n\nPatrick defeated three-term incumbent David Dewhurst in the primary runoff for lieutenant governor on May 27, 2014. He then won the position in the fall general election. He was re-elected in 2018, defeating Democratic nominee Mike Collier.\n\nPatrick was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on April 4, 1950. He was reared in a blue-collar neighborhood in East Baltimore. He is the only child of the former Vilma Jean Marshall (1926–2016) and Charles Anthony Goeb (1926–2002), who worked at the \"Baltimore Sun\" for thirty-one years as a newspaper vendor, before he retired in 1984. In later life, he legally changed his surname from Goeb to Patrick.\n\nPatrick graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; he is the first member of his family to graduate from college.\n\nPatrick started his first radio job in 1968 at the age of 18. After college, in 1977, he became a television broadcaster at WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Patrick later held a similar position at WTTG in Washington, D.C., before he became the lead sportscaster with KHOU-TV in Houston.\n\nAs a broadcaster, Patrick was able to get attention through various stunts, such as painting himself blue in support for the Houston Oilers and wearing a large cowboy hat. He became the second most popular TV personality in Houston by 1983, as well as one of the most well-known, though surveys also found that he was one of the most disliked. Patrick also had excellent public speaking skills, which caused him to be nicknamed \"the Silver-tongued Devil.\" Patrick left his job at KHOU in the mid-1980s after failing to reach an agreement with the station's new ownership for a long-term contract.\n\nAccording to Patrick, as his surname from birth, \"Goeb\", was not pleasant-sounding or spelled as it sounded, he did not use it from his first day as a radio host. Instead, he used the pseudonym \"Dan Scott\". When Patrick became a television broadcaster in 1977, he changed his air name at the request of the person who hired him in order to avoid confusing Patrick with another anchor at a competitor station with the last name of Scott. Patrick chose \"Dan Patrick\", with \"Patrick\" being his middle name of his wife's brother. Patrick continued to use this name, and by the time he legally changed his name around 2004, he and his family were known as \"the Patricks\".\n\nIn November 1983, Patrick and several investors opened one of the first sports bars in the U.S., which they named Dan and Nick’s Sportsmarket. The bar did well for a time, due to \"the strength of Patrick’s personality\" and an oil boom in Houston at the time, and they eventually took ownership of five sports bars in the city. Patrick's mother was the company bookkeeper. Questions later arose during the 2014 lieutenant governor's race about the immigration status of one of Patrick's employees, Miguel \"Mike\" Andrade. Patrick and Andrade offered different recollections about Andrade's employment. The matter was raised by one of Patrick's opponents, Jerry Patterson, who questioned Patrick's declared commitment to halt illegal immigration.\n\nWhen the oil boom ended, Houston's economy fell, something which fatally hurt Patrick's sports bar chain. In 1986, after the sports bars failed, Patrick filed for personal bankruptcy. In October 1992, the case was closed, discharging several hundred thousand dollars in remaining debts. Patrick, who stated it took him 10 years for him and his family \"to regain financial equilibrium,\" has frequently and openly discussed the ordeal and stated how it shaped him as an individual and conservative.\n\nSoon after his bankruptcy, Patrick \"reinvented himself.\" He became a conservative talk radio host in the 1990s. He began by buying a four-hour timeslot at AM 700 KSEV (then called KTBT) in the summer of 1987. He originally was a sports radio host, operating out of his remaining sports bar. However, he was able to take over the radio station in 1988, and he switched to politics shortly afterward. He hosted a conservative radio talk show. The program, \"Dan Patrick & Friends\", was broadcast in the Houston radio market on KSEV and in Dallas on AM 1160 KVCE.\n\nPatrick grew successful and influential through his talk radio career. He earned high name recognition. As a talk radio host, Patrick advocated for fiscal conservatism, evangelical Christian values on social issues, and he became a vocal opponent of illegal immigration. He was also known as a populist. Patrick's talk radio career was instrumental to his political rise, including his election and influence in the State Senate and his eventual election as lieutenant governor. One notable decision Patrick made as the owner of a talk radio station was to sign Rush Limbaugh, who was not well known at the time, to be heard on KSEV in 1989, via radio syndication. Limbaugh's success as a national talk show host helped raise the popularity of Patrick's radio station.\n\nBy February 2006, Patrick already owned one radio station. In 2006, Patrick signed a deal to purchase radio station KMGS AM 1160 in Highland Park, Texas (now KBDT). By 2013, Patrick was the majority owner of two radio stations, in Houston and Dallas radio markets. Patrick continued broadcasting after his election as a State Senator, and he continued to own KSEV after his election as lieutenant governor.\n\nPatrick considered running for the United States House of Representatives in 2004. According to Patrick, while he was still considering a congressional run he changed his legal name to his air name of \"Dan Patrick\" as candidates could only list their legal name on the ballot rather than a pseudonym.\n\nIn November 2008, Patrick began work to produce \"The Heart of Texas\", a movie based on a real-life story of two families in Simonton, a small Houston-area city. The movie was released the next year on DVD.\n\nPatrick proposed a boycott of Bill Maher's television show \"Politically Incorrect\" over controversial statements made by the comedian following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Patrick is also frequently at odds with the \"Houston Chronicle\" and announced a boycott of that newspaper in April 2004. He owned a blog called \"Chronically Biased \", which criticized the newspaper.\n\nPatrick was first elected to Texas State Senate's seventh district in 2006, winning the primary election with 68.8% of the vote and the general election with 69.2% of the vote. His term began on January 9, 2007 with the convening of the Eightieth Texas Legislature.\n\nDuring his first month as a legislator, Patrick introduced Senate Bill 186. If passed, it would have made abortion in Texas illegal should the Supreme Court overturn \"Roe v. Wade\". The bill was co-sponsored by fellow Texas state senators Craig Estes and Glenn Hegar.\n\nPatrick obtained passage of three Senate bills during his first session, the fewest number among the five freshmen senators. The other four freshmen Senators—Glenn Hegar (32 Senate bills passed), Kirk Watson (15 Senate bills passed), Robert Nichols (14 Senate bills passed), and Carlos Uresti (12 bills passed) – had previous government experience in other capacities.\n\nIn the 2010 general election, Patrick was reelected with 86.4% of the vote. He also endorsed Rick Perry for re-election in the 2010 election. Soon after winning re-election, Patrick announced, and subsequently created, a Tea Party Caucus in the Texas state legislature, which at its creation had 48 legislative members.\n\nW. Gardner Selby, editor of the \"Austin American-Statesman\"'s \"PolitiFact Texas\", listed Patrick as third among the top 10 Republican political influencers in Texas. Patrick is also listed in \"Texas Monthly\" as one of the state's most powerful players.\n\nIn May 2012, acrimony between Patrick and fellow Republican state senator John Carona was widely reported throughout Texas. In an email exchange, Patrick accused Carona of spreading false rumors about Patrick's marriage. Carona denied that, and additionally denied having commented on Patrick's sexuality. Carona further said to Patrick: \"I've never been shy about sharing my dislike and distrust of you. Put bluntly, I believe you are a snake oil salesman, a narcissist that would say anything to draw attention to himself.\" News reports suggest that the feud was motivated by positioning to succeed David Dewhurst as lieutenant governor should Dewhurst have won a seat as U.S. senator, in 2012.\n\n\nOn June 26, 2013, Patrick announced he would challenge incumbent David Dewhurst in the Republican primary for lieutenant governor in 2014. This challenge came despite Patrick's enthusiastic endorsement of Dewhurst in his failed 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate. Patrick stated that while he had been planning on retiring from politics after his Senate term ended, he decided to run for lieutenant governor after Dewhurst failed to end fellow State Senator Wendy Davis's filibuster of Texas Senate Bill 5 and after Senator Jane Nelson refused to run herself.\n\nIn his race for lieutenant governor, Patrick was endorsed in July 2013 by Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who ran unsuccessfully for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. In 2012, Huckabee had also endorsed David Dewhurst for the U.S. Senate nomination for the seat vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. Victory went, however, to the Republican Ted Cruz.\n\nAt a candidate forum in College Station in January 2014, Patrick said that he and two other challengers to Dewhurst, Jerry E. Patterson and Todd Staples, could have sought re-election in their current positions as Land Commissioner and Texas Commissioner of Agriculture, respectively, but were instead \"putting our positions on the line because we need new leadership. ... An energetic, passionate conservative to lead the Senate.\"\n\nAt the candidate forum, Patrick described education as a key issue in his campaign because of the 25 percent statewide high school drop-out rate, rising to 40 to 50 percent in the inner cities. He stated that \"we do not have a future in the state of Texas if we have half of the next adult population – majority being Hispanic – don't have a high school degree.\" Patrick said that as lieutenant governor, he would work to secure the border with Mexico and to abolish sanctuary cities and in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. He also called for lowering property taxes.\n\nPatrick led the four-candidate field in the primary with 550,769 votes (41.5%). Dewhurst followed with 376,196 (28.3%); Staples, with 235,981 (17.8%), and Patterson, 165,787 (12.5%). Election watchers did not expect Patrick to get first place. In the runoff election on May 27, Patrick won with 487,829 votes (65.1%), defeating Dewhurst, who had 262,086 votes (34.9%). Patrick's victory was one of several notable primary victories by Tea Party movement-aligned Republicans in the election runoff.\n\nAccording to Ross Ramsey of \"The Texas Tribune\", Patrick did not shift to the political middle as the general election approached, contrary to what political candidates typically do. On November 4, 2014, Patrick won the general election against his state Senate colleague, Democrat Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, to become the lieutenant governor-elect of Texas. He was swept into office in a Republican landslide that saw the party retain all statewide elected offices for the fifth consecutive election.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the day before the 85th Texas Legislature began its session, Patrick announced he would run for re-election in 2018. He stated his early announcement was in order to dispel rumors that he would challenge Governor Greg Abbott or U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. Patrick easily won the Republican primary on March 6, 2018, defeating Rockwall City Council Member Scott Milder.\n\nIn addition to his own campaign, Patrick was active in endorsing and assisting Republican primary candidates in the Texas Senate, including some challengers to GOP incumbents. Patrick's favored candidates won nearly all the races where Patrick made intraparty endorsements. Later in the year, Patrick donated nearly $175,000 to Texas Senate candidate Pete Flores in a special election; Flores won the election in an upset, increasing Patrick's chances of keeping a three-fifths GOP majority in the Senate after the 2018 elections. Patrick succeeded in maintaining a three-fifths majority in the Senate, though Republican Senator Kel Seliger was considered a possible swing-vote.\n\nIn the November 6 general election, Patrick won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic nominee Mike Collier. He won about 51% of the vote against Collier's 47%.\n\nPatrick was sworn in on January 20, 2015. Soon after assuming office, the Texas Senate voted to drop the threshold needed to consider a bill from two-thirds to three-fifths, something that Patrick had long supported. Under Patrick, the Senate enforced proceedural rules that had long been ignored.\n\nMajor legislation that Patrick helped pass during his tenure as lieutenant governor include legalization of campus carry and open carry, a bill allowing pastors to refuse marrying couples if it violates their beliefs, and expanded border security and enforcement measures.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, Patrick criticized the Obama administration, after it released a directive stating that all public schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom and locker facilities that correspond with their identified gender, stating that, on the prospect of the federal government withholding funding for Texas schools for not following the directive, \"he can keep his 30 pieces of silver [and that w]e will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States.\"\n\nPatrick supported and strongly advocated for a bathroom bill proposed on January 5, 2017 by Senator Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham.\n\nPatrick made legislation prohibiting state or local governments from issuing subpoenas on pastors' sermons a priority in the 2017 session. Governor Abbott signed the bill into law on May 21, 2017.\n\nPatrick opposes abortion and supported Texas' \"Mandatory Ultrasound Bill\", a bill signed into law in May 2011 by Governor Perry, which requires women seeking abortion to have a sonogram of the fetus taken at least twenty-four hours before the abortion is performed.\n\nPatrick opposes abortion in cases of incest and rape. In January 2014, when he was asked about exceptions to outlawing abortion, Patrick said, \"The only exception would be if the life of the mother was truly in danger…but that is rare.\"\n\nPatrick supports increasing the number of charter schools in the state.\n\nIn February 2011, Patrick, who at the time was vice chairman of the Texas senate's Committee on Education, spoke in favor of cutting an unspecified number of non-teaching positions from the state's public school districts, citing positions such as \"math department supervisors\" or \"curriculum experts\". At the time, Patrick cited a statistic later determined to be misleading by PolitiFact.com that Texas's 1,200+ public school districts, considered as a group, are the fifth-largest employer in the world.\n\nPatrick is on record as determined to establish creationism within the public school curriculum in Texas, despite court rulings that such a policy would violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nPatrick identifies the experience of his personal bankruptcy as having shaped his conservatism in fiscal policy. Patrick joined with restaurateur Edd Hendee and Paul Bettencourt, the former Harris County tax assessor-collector and Patrick's successor in the state Senate, both on-air hosts on Patrick's station, to form \"Citizens Lowering Our Unfair Taxes\" (CLOUT), a political organization that was originally formed to push for lower property taxes in Texas.\n\nPatrick opposes illegal immigration. As a talk radio host, he reserved some of his \"most hard-edged oratory for illegal immigrants.\" Patrick expressed support for Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law, and supports passing a similar law in Texas that would allow local law enforcement to ask lawfully-stopped individuals about their immigration status and would make it a state misdemeanor to be present in Texas as an illegal immigrant.\n\nAs Lieutenant Governor, Patrick moved to keep National Guard troops sent to the Texas-Mexico border during the illegal immigration surge of 2014 indefinitely, rather than until March 2015, as originally planned. Patrick's 2015 budget in the Texas Senate called for spending $815 million on border security, which he said was more than the previous seven years combined. Governor Greg Abbott signed the measure—for about $800 million—into law. In a June 2018 interview on Fox Business Network, Patrick estimated that 30 million illegal immigrants lived in the U.S.\n\nOn February 26, 2014, following a federal court ruling the Texas ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, Patrick asserted his position that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. He then further stated his intentions to fight such decisions should he be elected to the Lt. Governor's office.\n\nPatrick strongly opposed HERO, an unsuccessful Houston ordinance intended to establish legal protections for gay and transgender residents along with some other classes, as he claimed that the ordinance would lead to sexual predators being freely able to enter women's restrooms. Patrick has stated that if necessary, he would support legislation to require people to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender listed on their birth certificates.\n\nHours after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Patrick tweeted a picture of the Bible verse, \"Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Galatians 6:7.\" An adviser released a statement that the tweet had been pre-scheduled, and the tweet was later deleted. Patrick issued a statement on the incident, again stating that the tweet was pre-planned and that \"I didn’t pull down the FB post & tweet because God’s word is wrong. His word is never wrong ... I took it down to stop the hateful comments and the misinformation being spread of God’s message to all of us- straight or gay.\"\n\nPatrick encouraged state Senator Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham to introduce a bathroom bill similar to a previous law adopted in 2016 in North Carolina, and strongly pushed for it at its proposal on January 5, 2017. Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, a moderate Republican, said that the measure is not an important matter for lower chamber.\n\nIn November 2012, Patrick asked Texas attorney general Greg Abbott's office to issue an opinion on the constitutionality of government entities providing domestic partner insurance benefits. An amendment to the Texas Constitution in 2005 limits marriage to heterosexual relationships and prohibits similar, alternative legal arrangements. Patrick did not disclose his own views on same-sex marriage or civil unions for same-sex couples. He told the \"Houston Chronicle\" that his request was prompted by Dallas County's November 2012 decision and an Austin-area public school district's October 2012 decision to join other Texas cities and counties in extending benefits to their unmarried employees' heterosexual or homosexual partners.\n\nPatrick was interviewed extensively on ABC's \"20/20\" segment \"The Age of Consent: When Young Love Is a Sex Crime,\" defending his position favoring very tough Texas statutory rape laws. \"While it seems unfair, he was 19, she was 15,\" says Patrick, \"That's the price you pay. Even if you end up getting married.\"\n\nPatrick is a strong supporter of maintaining Confederate monuments on public display, despite opposition from civil rights groups who consider the statues as a defense of the institution of slavery. As one of six members of the board that oversees the Texas State Capitol grounds, Patrick described the need: \"to learn from history all of our history, including events and times that many would like to forget. ... Our goal should be to have a meaningful dialogue for future generations so those moments in our history are not repeated.\"\n\nPatrick endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential primaries and served as his Texas campaign chairman. After businessman Donald Trump became the Republican nominee, Patrick endorsed Trump and eventually became the Texas state chairman for his campaign. Trump won Texas by 9 percentage points, the closest result since 1996. In January 2018, Patrick stated that he considered Presidents Trump and Ronald Reagan as the two greatest presidents in his lifetime, and the \"Austin American-Statesman\" described Patrick as an \"ardent defender\" of Trump.\n\nPatrick's first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife is Janetlea \"Jan\" Patricia Rankin, a former teacher. The couple was married in 1975 and lives in the Houston suburb of Cypress. They have two children, Ryan and Shane. Ryan served as a district judge from Harris County, Texas, and swore in his father in 2015, for his term as lieutenant governor of Texas. In July 2017, Ryan Patrick was chosen to be U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas by U.S. President Donald Trump, and the United States Senate subsequently confirmed him.\n\nWhile growing up, Patrick and his family were \"not very religious.\" After moving to Houston, he and his wife attended a Catholic church, but he joined a Baptist church soon after learning about it. Though Patrick was a member of the Second Baptist Church Houston since 1992, he stated he was not truly a Christian until March 1994, when, on a television-and-radio convention in Las Vegas, he repented of his sins, committed his life to God, and was saved. After this, Patrick's faith became an important part of his life, and he considered going into Christian ministry for a time.\n\nPatrick, an evangelical Christian, is a member of various Christian organizations, including Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the International Bible Society, and has served as guest pastor of his church, the Second Baptist Church Houston. He is very outspoken about his Christian faith, and he stated in his inauguration speech upon becoming lieutenant governor that \"I respect all faiths and religions, but I am a Christian first, a conservative second and a Republican third, and I praise Jesus for this moment and this day.\" Patrick was baptized in the Jordan River during a trip to Israel in 2016.\n\n\n"}

It is, strictly speaking, not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise.\n\nThe most common use is a name change through a deed of change of name (often referred to simply as a \"deed poll\"). Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the UK, a deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it. The child's parents execute the deed poll on the child's behalf. In some other jurisdictions, a person may simply start using a new name without any formal legal process. The usual requirements are that the new name must be used exclusively and that the change must not be made with intent to defraud. In Australia, prior to 1 November 2000, name change was formerly accomplished by deed poll but now is done by completing a Change of Name form.\n\nThe UK Government provides a free web-based service to advise individuals on changing name using a deed poll. Several websites have been established that charge for this service, some of which appear to be from government agencies. However, these have no official status.\n\nAnother common use is to partition land into different sections. For example, a piece of land may be partitioned (or carved out) by a deed poll into Section A and the Remaining Portion thereof. This form of deed poll is commonly used in Hong Kong.\n\nA deed poll may also be used (in England and Wales) for clergy of the Church of England to relinquish their holy orders.\n\nThe term \"deed\", also known in this context as a \"specialty\", is common to signed written undertakings not supported by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, \"signed, sealed and delivered\", or even merely \"executed as a deed\") is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the obligation. \"Poll\" is an archaic legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting more than a single person (an \"indenture\", so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet, then the copies separated by being irregularly torn or cut, i.e. \"indented\", so that each party had a document with corresponding tears, to discourage forgery).\n\n"}

{"id": "3050963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3050963", "title": "Geoffrey of Vinsauf", "text": "Geoffrey of Vinsauf\n\nGeoffrey of Vinsauf (fl. 1200) is a representative of the early medieval grammarian movement, termed \"preceptive grammar\" by James J. Murphy for its interest in teaching \"ars poetria\" (1971, vii ff.).\n\n\"Ars poetria\" is a subdivision of the grammatical art (\"ars grammatica\") which synthesizes \"rhetorical\" and \"grammatical\" elements. The line of demarcation between these two fields is not firmly established in the Middle Ages. Gallo explains that \"both of these liberal arts taught composition and taught the student to examine the diction, figurative language, and meters of the curriculum authors who were to serve as models for imitation. However it was rhetoric and not grammar that was concerned with Invention of subject matter and with disposition or organization of the work\" as well as memory and delivery (72).\n\nMurphy explains that the medieval \"artes poetriae\" are divided into two types. First, there is the short, specialized type of treatise dealing with \"figurae\", \"colores\", \"tropi\", and other verbal ornaments. They appeared separately all over Europe, usually anonymous, and were incorporated in elementary schooling, as adjuncts to ordinary grammar instruction. The second type of \"ars poetriae\" includes such works as the \"Ars versificatoria\" (c. 1175) of Matthew of Vendôme, the \"Laborintus\" (after 1213, before 1280) of Eberhard the German, the \"Ars versificaria\" (c. 1215) of Gervase of Melkley, the \"Poetria nova\" (1208–1213) and the \"Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi\" (after 1213) of Geoffrey of Vinsauf, and the \"De arte prosayca, metrica, et rithmica\" (after 1229) of John of Garland (1971, xxi-xxii). The \"artes poetriae\" constituted poetry as an academic discipline, and promoted its participation in the methods of logic (Copeland).\n\nWe know very little about the life of Geoffrey of Vinsauf. From his \"Poetria nova\" we learn that he was at one time in England before going to Rome during the pontificate of Innocent III, to whom the \"Poetria nova\" was prepared as a special gift. The traditional account of Geoffrey of Vinsauf provides further details of his biography: he is believed to be born in Normandy, but initially educated at St. Frideswide, Oxford. He is said to have returned to the Continent for further university study, first in Paris and later in Italy. He incurred the displeasure of Bishop Adam, allegedly after a quarrel in Paris with a certain Robert, once his friend, and was forced to appeal to the mercy of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, perhaps through the intercession of that prelate, he journeyed back to England to become tutor at Hampton. At a still later date he is said to have been sent on an embassy to Innocent III, and thus to have developed relations with the Holy See. His designation as \"Vinsauf\", or \"de Vino Salvo\", is traceable to a treatise attributed to him on the keeping of the vine and other plants (Murphy 29-30).\n\nThe \"Poetria nova\" is a 2,000-line poem written around 1210 in Latin hexameters and dedicated to Pope Innocent III. The \"Poetria nova\" aimed to replace the standard text on verse composition, Horace's \"Ars poetica\" called the \"Poetria\" in the Middle Ages, which was widely read and commented upon in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Karsten Friis-Jensen suggests that Geoffrey of Vinsauf's \"main incentive for writing independent arts of poetry was probably a wish to systematize the exegetical material which generations of commentators had collected around Horace's text, in a structure that was in better accordance with traditional didactics in the closely related art of rhetoric\" (364). The medieval teacher intended to reshape the \"Ars poetica\" into an elementary textbook on composing poetry, \"modeled on the Ciceronian rhetorics and their medieval derivatives, such as the \"artes dictandi\" and the treatises on the \"colores rhetorici\"\" (Camargo 949). The \"Poetria nova\" almost immediately became one of the standard textbooks in England and was incorporated into the curriculum on the Continent very soon thereafter. To its popularity testifies the number of manuscripts (200) in which this work is found and extensive commentary, which takes form of marginal glosses around a text of the \"Poetria nova\" and a text copied separately by itself.\n\n\"Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi\" (Instruction in the Method and Art of Speaking and Versifying) written after 1213 is a prose counterpart of the \"Poetria nova\" which expands on amplification, abbreviation, and verbal ornamentation. It is preserved complete in three manuscripts and nearly complete in another two manuscripts. The thirteenth-century copies explicitly attribute the treatise to \"magistri Galfridi\" or \"magistri Galfridi le Vin est sauf\". Two other works are attributed to him: \"Summa de Coloribus Rhetoricis (A Summary of the Colors of Rhetoric)\", a briefer work, primarily on figures of speech, and the \"Causa Magistri Gaufredi Vinesauf\" (\"The Apology of Master Geoffrey of Vinsauf\"), a short poem of topical and political interest. He used to be regarded as the author of \"Itinerarium Regis Ricardi\", a narrative of the Third Crusade, but this is certainly false.\n\nThe texts of the \"Poetria nova, Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi\", and \"Summa de coloribus rhetoricis\" are included in Edmond Faral, \"Les arts poétiques du XIIe et du XIIIe siècle\" (Paris, 1924; reprinted Paris, 1958), pages 197-262, 265-320, and 321-327 respectively. The \"Poetria nova\" has been translated into English three times: by Margaret F. Nims, \"Poetria nova\" (Toronto, 1967), by Ernest Gallo, \"The Poetria nova and its Sources in Early Rhetorical Doctrine\" (The Hague, 1971), and by Jane Baltzell Kopp, \"Poetria nova\", in \"Three Medieval Rhetorical Arts\", ed. James J. Murphy (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1971), pp. 32–108. \"Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi\" is translated by Roger Parr, \"Instruction in the Method and Art of Speaking and Versifying\" (Milwaukee, 1968). In this article, quotations are from Kopp's translation.\n\nThe \"Poetria nova\" is a preceptive treatise, that is, it gives a specific advice to future writers about the composition of poetry. Its handbook genre is reinforced by multiple illustrations of its precepts entirely invented by Geoffrey of Vinsauf, rather than culled from classical authors. The text itself serves as an illustration of techniques it teaches. Thus, the treatment of amplification is amplified, the treatment of abbreviation is abbreviated, metaphor is discussed in figurative language. As Woods notes, the applicability of the instructions of \"Poetria nova\" to both verse and prose and the various ways it could be used in the classroom, combined with the range of styles that Geoffrey of Vinsauf used to illustrate techniques, made it the general all-purpose medieval rhetorical treatise \"par excellence\" (1).\n\nA thirteenth century anonymous commentary on the \"Poetria nova\" notes the twofold nature of this book: first, the five parts of the book are the five parts of rhetoric: Invention, disposition, style, memory, and delivery; second, the \"Poetria nova\" is itself a rhetorical discourse with the necessary parts: \"exordium\", \"narratio, divisio, confutatio\", and \"conclusio\". Its author is, consequently, an accomplished theoretician, orator, and \"a good teacher\" (Woods 668-9).\n\nThe \"Poetria nova\" incorporates Ciceronian precept on invention and arrangement, Horatian doctrine on decorum, and instructions on style including the tropes, figures of words and figures of thought derived from the pseudo-Ciceronian \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\". Gallo summarizes the major topics of the \"Poetria nova\" as follows (numbers in parentheses refer to line numbers of the original Latin verse) (69):\nFigurative language is discussed in detail in the \"Poetria nova\", which marks this treatise as grammatical. However, two of the central parts of the \"Poetria nova\" - Invention of subject matter and disposition or organization of the work - belong to the domain of rhetoric. Likewise, memory and delivery are traditionally affiliated with rhetoric. The \"Poetria nova\" thus constitutes an intersection of grammar and rhetoric in the medieval curriculum.\n\nThe \"Poetria nova\" opens with a famous passage about planning a poem and defining the limits of its subject matter. Geoffrey of Vinsauf distinguishes between the natural order and the artificial or artistic order in which the author can narrate the events.Geoffrey of Vinsauf prefers the artificial order and recommends a proverbial opening.\n\nThe subject matter can be presented either through a lengthy treatment or a brief recapitulation of the story. Among the methods of amplification are refining or dwelling on a point; periphrasis; comparison; apostrophe; prosopopeia; digression; description; and opposition. Brevity of the narration can be achieved by the following devices: emphasis, articulus, absolute ablative \"without a rower\" [i.e. a preposition], skillful indication of one thing among the rest, \"chains removed from between clauses\" [i.e. omitting conjunctions], the sense of many clauses in one, and omitting repetition of the same word.\n\nGeoffrey of Vinsauf distinguishes between \"ornatus gravis\" ['difficult/serious/dignified ornament'] and \"ornatus levis\" ['easy/pleasant/light ornament']. \"Gravitas\" can be achieved by using the ten tropes listed in the pseudo-Ciceronian \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\".The chief trope is metaphor. The \"ornatus levis\" includes the figures of diction and of thought given in the \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\".These figures are for the most part non-metaphorical.\n\nThe doctrine of conversion is a systematic method of varying a given sentence while preserving its meaning to make the sequence of words pleasant. The doctrine of determination consists primarily of creating a long sequence of brief phrases. This is the method and the manner of Sidonius. The contrary practice is that of Seneca: to round off the verses with a quick conclusion. Geoffrey of Vinsauf, however, prefers to be \"neither as long, nor as short, rather both long and short, being made both out of neither\".\n\nThe remaining doctrines are treated very briefly. Words should be carefully chosen to keep the balance of meaning and form. The characters' actions and their speeches should be appropriate for their age, and the overall color should be in harmony with the subject. Excessive alliteration, awkward violation of word order, and overly long periods are stylistic faults to be avoided. To polish his work an author has to apply \"first the mind, second the ear, and third and last, that which should conclude the matter - usage\". Only delight fosters memory. In delivery, one must follow the sense imitating in a controlled manner the emotions called for by the subject. Geoffrey of Vinsauf concludes his treatise with the observation that \"power comes from speech, since life and death rest in its hands; however, language may perchance be aided, in moderation, by both expression and gesture\".\n\nPopularity of Geoffrey of Vinsauf's didactic treatises has raised the question of possible influence on the later English poets such as Geoffrey Chaucer (ca. 1342-1400), Thomas Usk (d. 1388), and John Gower (ca. 1330-1408). Chaucer's parody in the \"Nun's Priest's Tale\" of Geoffrey of Vinsauf's use of apostrophe seems to ridicule the instruction provided in the \"Poetria nova\", and has therefore been interpreted as Chaucer's contempt for Geoffrey of Vinsauf's doctrine. A more profound examination of Chaucer's principles of composition, however, reveals that the essential scheme of the \"Wife of Bath's Prologue\" (specifically, lines 193-828) conforms to the doctrine promulgated by Geoffrey of Vinsauf's \"Documentum\". The integration of the \"Poetria nova\" precepts into Troilus and Criseyde I, 1065-71 reflects Chaucer's interest in rhetorical doctrine in general, and in Geoffrey of Vinsauf's in particular.\n\nThe contribution of Geoffrey of Vinsauf to the \"artes poetriae\" is acknowledged by such distinguished rhetoricians, as John of Garland (ca. 1180 - ca. 1258), a teacher of grammar and literature at the University of Paris, in the \"Parisiana poetria\" (known also as \"De arte prosayca, metrica, et rithmica\", written and revised probably between 1220 and 1235), and Eberhard the German in the \"Laborintus\". Geoffrey of Vinsauf is praised by Gervais of Melkley and Desiderius Erasmus (1469–1536). Kelly asserts that understanding and appreciation of the writings of the great medieval poets, such as Chaucer, Dante, Gottfried von Strassburg, and Chrétien de Troyes, can only be fully achieved if studied in the light of the instruction contained in treatises like Geoffrey of Vinsauf's \"Poetria nova\" and \"Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi\".\n\n\n"}

In 1905, aged 12, Edwards joined the London Diocese Church Lads Brigade. In 1907 he left school and began a seven-year apprenticeship to a printer. Dissatisfied with that career, he developed political aspirations and joined the local branch of the Liberal Party, for whom he campaigned. \nOn the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Edwards enlisted in the Royal Sussex Regiment and by late 1915 he was in Bombay en route for Tekrit, where he worked to build the railway track between there and Baghdad. He was commissioned in the field, and achieved the rank of Captain. In 1921 he returned to the UK and married Phyllis. The couple opened a stationer's shop and printing works in Balham, and Edwards tried to launch himself into a political career, standing for parliamentary and council seats as a Liberal candidate on several occasions, but with no success. By this stage he also had four children to support.\n\nEdwards became a spiritual healer when he attended a meeting at a spiritualist church in 1935 and was told by the mediums present that he had healing powers. His early attempts at spiritual healing were met with success, and gradually his reputation as a healer spread and his services became more in demand. During the Second World War Edwards served in the Home Guard and continued to run his printing business alongside his now growing practice as a healer. Gradually, as his fame spread, his healing took over from his printing business, which was later to be run by a brother. He moved to Stoneleigh in Surrey just after the war, where he used the front room of his house as a healing sanctuary. \n\nEventually, because of the increasing number of patients visiting him Edwards outgrew this home, so in 1946 he moved his family and his healing practice to Burrows Lea, a large house with several acres of gardens and woodland in Shere, where he founded the 'Harry Edwards Healing Sanctuary'. As his fame as a healer spread he was receiving 10,000 letters a week asking for help and distance healing. \n\nIn 1948 Edwards held a healing demonstration in Manchester which was attended by 6,000 people. In September 1951 during the Festival of Britain he appeared at the Royal Festival Hall in London, where he demonstrated spiritual healing to a packed hall. In 1955 he founded and was the first President of the National Federation of Spiritual Healers (NFSH). Edwards visited the island of Cyprus for his initiation into Daskalos' inner circle \"The Researchers of Truth\". The ceremony happened on April 1, 1954. \n\nAn 'Archbishops' Commission on Divine Healing' was set up in 1953 to investigate spiritual healing, and Edwards addressed the Commission in 1954, providing it with documentary evidence of a number of cases of successful healing for it to examine. At the same time he held a public demonstration in front of 6,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall to launch the '10 o'clock Healing Minute'. The Commission's report, published in 1958, stated that neither the Church or the medical profession accepted the claims of spirit healers that they were responsible for successful healings. Despite the fact that Harry Edwards had appeared before the Commission he was never sent a copy of the final report.\n\nEdwards claimed that several deceased scientists worked through him, including Lord Lister and Louis Pasteur. The founder of the Aetherius Society, George King was complimentary of his healing powers.\n\nHarry Edwards died in December 1976 aged 83.\n\nA study in the \"British Medical Journal\" (Rose, 1954) investigated spiritual healing, therapeutic touch and faith healing. In a hundred cases that were investigated, no single case revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability. Edwards claimed he had cured about a hundred thousand people in Britain but Rose could not verify a single cure by Edwards. Rose visited a healing session held by Edwards and observed that an old lady had claimed to have been cured during the session and had walked without her sticks, but by the time the session was over was walking with two sticks out of the hall.\n\n\n\n"}

During Ibrahim Pasha's rule, he also served as the governor of Sidon Eyalet.\n\nIn the first days of the Egyptian conquest of Ottoman Syria, Husayn Abd al-Hadi welcomed the Egyptian commander Ibrahim Pasha after first coordinating a response to the conquest with Emir Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon. He accompanied Ibrahim Pasha in his siege of Acre, where the Wali of Sidon Eyalet, Abdullah Pasha was holding out. Ibrahim viewed the Abd al-Hadi family as a rising star among the rural nobility of Jabal Nablus and selected Husayn, the head of the clan, to be his deputy in Palestine, while Acre was still under siege. Acre capitulated in May 1832. The elevation of a member of the Abd al-Hadi clan came at the expense of the Tuqan clan's traditional and influential position in Jabal Nablus. Ibrahim Pasha spent most of his time in other parts of Syria and Husayn administered Palestine on his behalf.\n\nDuring the 1834 peasants' revolt in Palestine, Husayn supported Ibrahim Pasha. The revolt was suppressed by the end of the year and Husayn was rewarded for his loyalty and effective service by being promoted to Mudir of Sidon Eyalet, which included all of Palestine. He may have been assigned the post prior to the revolt, in late 1833. In October 1834, shortly after the execution of the main rebel leader of the revolt, Qasim al-Ahmad, Husayn purchased both his home and soap factory in Nablus, where he relocated from his home village of Arraba. Soap was a major source of revenue in the city and owning factories represented power and wealth. Shaykh Yusef Qadri of Ya'bad served as Husayn's principal agent in Nablus, helped him acquire numerous prime commercial properties there and partnered with him in many of those investments.\n\nHusayn served as Mudir of Sidon until his death in 1835 or 1836 (1251 AH). He is buried in the courtyard of the Zaytuna Mosque in Acre. A number of Husayn's sons also owned factories or served various administrative or political offices, including ٍSulayman (who succeeded his father as Wali), Mahmud, Muhammad and Abd ar-Rahman.\n\n"}
{"id": "244273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244273", "title": "Jacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne", "text": "Jacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne\n\nJacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne (23 April 17563 June 1819), also known as Jean Nicolas, was a French personality of the Revolutionary period. Though not one of the most well known figures of the French Revolution, Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne was an instrumental figure of the period known as the Reign of Terror. Billaud-Varenne climbed his way up the ladder of power during the period of The Terror, becoming one of the most militant members of the Committee of Public Safety. He was recognized and worked with French Revolution figures Georges Danton and Maximilien Robespierre, and is often considered one of the key architects of the period known as The Terror. \"No, we will not step backward, our zeal will only be smothered in the tomb; either the Revolution will triumph or we will all die.\"\n\nBillaud-Varenne was born in La Rochelle as the son of a lawyer to the \"parlement\" of Paris. Since both his grandfather and father were lawyers, and he was the first son in his direct family, Varenne was guaranteed a solid education and the same profession. Billaud-Varenne was educated at the College of Oratorians of Niort and took Philosophy at La Rochelle. His education at Niort was particularly important in shaping his character because its methods of teaching were uncommon to the revolution. At Niort, modernity and tolerance were emphasized, as opposed to overbearing and possibly obstructive religious instruction present in most other schools of the time. Billaud-Varenne was also sent to Oratory school at Juilly, where he later became a professor when he felt dissatisfied with practicing law. Here he remained for a short while, until his writing of a comédie strained his relationship with those who ran the school and he was obliged to leave in 1785, the Oratorian college where he was Hall prefect of studies. He then went to Paris, married and bought a position as lawyer in the \"parlement\". In early 1789 he published at Amsterdam a three-volume work on the \"Despotisme des ministres de la France\" as well as a well received anti-clerical text titled \"The Last Blow Against Prejudice and Superstition.\" As events moved closer towards Bastille Day, he adopted with enthusiasm the principles of the Revolution. An example of his beliefs regarding the Church can be found in this text: \n\n\"\"However painful an amputation may be, when a member is gangrened it must be sacrificed if we wish to save the body.\"\n\nJoining the Jacobin Club, Billaud-Varenne became, from 1790, one of the most violent anti-Royalist orators, closely linked to Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois. After the flight to Varennes of King Louis XVI, he published a pamphlet, \"L'Acéphocratie\", in which he demanded the establishment of a federal republic.\n\nOn 1 July, in another speech at the Jacobin Club, he spoke of a republic, arousing the derision of partisans of the constitutional monarchy. But when he repeated his demand for a republic a fortnight later, the speech was printed and sent to the Jacobin branch societies throughout France.\n\nOn the night of 10 August 1792 (during the attack on the Tuileries Palace) he met with Danton, Desmoulins, and other members of the Insurrectionary Commune during the critical hours before the overthrow of the monarchy. Later that day, he was elected one of the \"deputy-commissioners\" of the sections who shortly afterwards became the general council of the Paris Commune. He was accused of having been an accomplice in the September Massacres in the Abbaye prison.\n\nElected, like Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Collot d'Herbois, a deputy of Paris to the National Convention, he spoke in favour of the immediate abolition of the Bourbon monarchy, and the next day demanded that all acts be dated from the \"Year I of the French Republic\" (a measure adopted a little over a year later in the form of the French Revolutionary Calendar).\n\nAt the trial of Louis XVI he added new charges to the accusation, proposed to refuse counsel to the king, and voted for death \"within 24 hours\". On 2 June 1793, in the context of Jean-Paul Marat's anti-Girondist instigations, he proposed a decree of accusation against the Girondists; a week later, at the Jacobin Club, he outlined a programme which the Convention was to fulfil soon after: the expulsion of foreigners, the establishment of a tax on the rich, the deprivation of the rights of citizenship of all \"anti-social\" men, the creation of a French Revolutionary Army, the monitoring of all officers and \"ci-devant\" nobles (i.e.: those of aristocratic families who no longer held status after the abolition of feudalism), and the death penalty for unsuccessful generals fighting in the French Revolutionary Wars.\n\nOn 15 July he made a violent speech in the Convention in accusation of the Girondists. Sent in August as representative on mission to the \"départements\" of the Nord and of Pas-de-Calais, he showed himself inexorable to all suspects.\n\nOn his return, the calamities of the summer of 1793 and caused the Paris Commune to begin to organize an insurrection - an insurrection that would lead to Billaud-Varenne's ascension to the most powerful body in all of France. When the popular uprising did come on 5 September and the Commune marched on the National Convention, Billaud-Varenne was one of the chief speakers agitating for change in leadership. He called for a new war plan from the Ministry of War and that a new Committee be created to oversee the whole government - thus superseding the existing Committee of Public Safety. To mollify the insurrectionists, that night Billaud-Varenne was named President of the National Convention for a special two week session, followed by him being named to the Committee of Public Safety the next day. Along with Collot d'Herbois, who was named the same day, his addition was seen as a way to co-opt the Paris Commune. Once added to Committee of Public Safety, he was then played a major role in defending it - calling for unity instead of change - on 25 October when the National Convention complained about the Committee and then officially sanctioned them. He was included in the Reign of Terror's Committee of Public Safety, which had decreed the mass arrest of all suspects and the establishment of a revolutionary army, caused the extraordinary criminal tribunal to be named officially \"Revolutionary Tribunal\" (on 29 October 1793), demanded the execution of Marie Antoinette, and then attacked Jacques René Hébert and Danton. Meanwhile, he published \"Les Éléments du républicanisme\", in which he demanded a division of property among the citizens.\n\nOnce named to the Committee, Billaud-Varenne became a vocal defender of that body. Based in Paris during much of this year, Billaud-Varenne and Barère worked to develop the administrative apparatus and consolidate the power of the Committee. To that end, in early December he proposed a radical centralization of authority, a law that became known as the Law of 14 Frimaire. This law brought surveillance, economic requisition, the dispatch of legislative news, local administrators, and representatives on mission under the control of the Committee.He was also instrumental in defending the Terror: when a measure was passed into law in mid November 1793 allowing the accused the right of defense, Billaud-Varenne uttered his famous words in defense of the Terror:\n\n\"No, we will not step backward, our zeal will only be smothered in the tomb; either the revolution will triumph or we will all die.\"\" The law enabling right of defense was overturned the next day.\n\nAs 1794 progressed, Robespierre began to speak out against over zealous factions: he believed both pro-Terror and indulgent positions were dangerous to the well-being of the Revolution. Robespierre saw danger in members of the Revolution, like Billaud-Varenne, Collot d'Herbois, and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier who had been too committed to attacks on Church property or had been too vigorous in their pursuit of revolutionary justice (such as Collot at Lyon). The deChristianization program was seen as divisive and unnecessary by some in the Convention. Furthermore, the law of 22 Prairial had isolated the police wing of the Convention: the Committee of General Security, a body that was extremely anti-clerical, had seen their power severely diminished by the law. The law of 22 Prairial reduced the right of defense to simply an appearance before court, while greatly expanding the list of crimes punishable by death. This is what led directly to the Great Terror, in which more were killed by the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris in those seven weeks than in the preceding fourteen months. Though Billaud-Varenne publicly defended it in the Convention, this law was a driving factor in the eventual reprisal against the Committee. Serious arguments began to fracture the Committee, with Billaud-Varenne and Collot d'Herbois pitted against Robespierre and Saint-Just. On 26 June, they argued over the imposition of a new prosecutor to the Revolutionary Tribunal. On 29 June, an argument once again broke out between members of the Committee of Public Safety. Though it could have been about the Catherine Théot affair or the law of 22 Prairial, it led to Billaud-Varenne branding Robespierre a dictator and the latter storming out of the Committee headquarters and ceasing to attend meetings. With tensions being heightened and more guillotined every day - the rate of executions per day in Paris rose from five a day in Germinal to twenty-six a day in Messidor - Billaud-Varenne and Collot d'Herbois began to fear for their safety.\n\nThroughout the early days of Thermidor, Bertrand Barère attempted to forge compromise between the splintering Committee. However, Robespierre was still convinced that the Convention needed further purging, and on 8 Thermidor he rose before that body to give a speech that would spark the Thermidorian Reaction. Speaking of \"monsters\" that threatened the Republic with conspiracy, his speech was pointed enough to serve as a warning while being vague enough to worry many in the body. When he was asked for the names of those in the conspiracy, Robespierre declined to provide them, and he was charged with indicting members of the Convention en masse without a hearing.\n\nThat night, Robespierre retreated to the Jacobin Club, where he gave the same speech to rousing applause. Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, as members who the speech may have been aimed at, attempted to defend themselves but were shouted down and expelled from the club as cries for \"la guillotine,\" rained down upon them. They returned to the Committee of Public Safety where they found Antoine Saint-Just, the protege of Robespierre, working on a speech he intended to deliver the next day. As one of the chief messengers of the terror, Collot and Billaud-Varenne both assumed that Saint-Just was writing their denunciation. At this moment the last argument of the Committee erupted, with Collot, Billaud-Varenne, and Barère attacking Saint-Just for \"dividing the nation.\" After sometime, they departed the Committee and organized the last elements of the Thermidorian Reaction.\n\nThe next day, 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne would play a critical role in the final stroke against Robespierre and his allies. As Saint-Just delivered his speech, he was interrupted near the beginning by another conspirator, Jean-Lambert Tallien. Billaud-Varenne was next to speak, with Collot d'Herbois controlling the debates from the President's Chair, and in an eloquent planned denunciation directly accused Robespierre of a conspiracy against the Republic. This speech and others were warmly received, and after continued debate arrest warrants were issued for Robespierre, Saint-Just, and their allies. After a brief armed standoff, the conspirators would carry the day, and Robespierre and his allies would be executed the next day.\n\nHowever, after 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne was soon enough to find himself in prison. Too closely associated with the excesses of the Reign of Terror, he was shortly attacked himself in the Convention for his ruthlessness, and a commission was appointed to examine his conduct and that of some other members of the former Committee of Public Safety. Billaud-Varenne was arrested, and as a result of the Jacobin-led insurrection of 12 Germinal of the Year III (1 April 1795), the Convention decreed his immediate deportation to French Guiana, along with Collot d'Herbois and Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac. After Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire coup, he refused the pardon offered by the French Consulate. In 1816 he left Guiana, went to New York City for a few months, and finally took refuge in Port-au-Prince (Haiti), where he died of dysentery.\n\n\n\n"}

His name is most famous because of the namesake cattle trail, which he originally scouted and developed to supply his various trading posts among the Plains Indians in what is now western Oklahoma. Although Chisholm died before the heyday of the Texas-to-Kansas cattle drives, he was nevertheless a participant in several important events in Texas and Oklahoma history.\n\nChisholm's father Ignatius was of Scottish descent, and his mother Martha (née Rogers) was a Cherokee from the region of Great Hiwassee. He moved with his mother to Oklahoma during a period when Cherokees were migrating voluntarily. In 1826, Chisholm became involved in a gold-seeking party, who blazed a trail and explored the region to present day Wichita, Kansas. In 1830, he helped blaze a trail from Fort Gibson to Fort Towson. In 1834, he was a member of the Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition, who made the first contact with the southern plains Indians on behalf of the United States federal government.\n\nIn 1836, Chisholm married Eliza Edwards. They resided in the area of her father's trading post on the Little River near its confluence with the Canadian River, where Jesse worked in the Indian trade.\n\nChisholm was an interpreter and general aid in several treaties between the Republic of Texas and local Indian tribes, as well as between the United States federal government and various tribes after Texas joined the United States. This diplomatic work spanned 20 years, between 1838 and 1858. During this period, he also continued in the Indian trade, trading manufactured goods for peltry and for cattle.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he mostly remained neutral. Many residents of Indian Territory feared they might be massacred, either intentionally or as an accident of war if either side attempted to contend for control of the territory. He led a band of refugees to the western part of the territory. For some time, they suffered privation, as the trade had dried up during the war, as well.\n\nAt the end of the war, he settled permanently near present-day Wichita, and recommenced trade into Indian Territory. He built up what had been a military and Indian trail into a road capable of carrying heavy wagons for his goods. This road became known as Chisholm's Trail. Later, when the Texas-to-Kansas cattle drives started, the users of the trail redubbed it the Chisholm Trail.\n\nHe died at his last camp near Left Hand Spring due to food poisoning on March 4, 1868, and is buried there.

Following the \"Great Disappointment\" Wendell experienced periods of weak faith, as did many Adventists. He eventually recovered his faith after renewing his study of Bible chronology (historic and prophetic) and began to preach extensively throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Virginias, and New England By the late 1860s he had been studying the chronology of the Bible, and was encouraged by conclusions showing Christ's return would occur in either 1868 or 1873/4. In 1870 Wendell published his views in the booklet entitled \"The Present Truth, or Meat in Due Season\" concluding that the Second Advent was sure to occur in 1873. Unknown to him, attendance at one of his presentations restored Charles Taze Russell's faith in the Bible as the true word of God, leading to Russell's ministry.\n\nIn 1871 the Associated Press circulated a story that Wendell had been arrested in Pennsylvania on the charge of \"improper intimacy\" with a 16-year-old girl. No evidence of impropriety was ever produced, and Wendell publicly denied not only the charges, but that he had ever been arrested.\n\nThe magazine \"The World's Crisis\" in the September 10, 1873 issue offered an obituary written by fellow Adventist and personal friend, George Stetson. A brief summary appears below:\n\nIn Memory of Elder Jonas Wendell\n\n\"He was born December 25, 1815, and fell asleep August 14 1873. Age fifty seven years, seven months, and fourteen days. ...\n\n\"He had settled on 1873 as the year in which \"the hope of seeing Jesus and being made like him\" should be realized by a waiting and expectant church, and set forth the reasons for his hope in a little work entitled, \"Present truth,\" or \"Meat in Due Season,\" ...\n\n\"... on Wednesday evening, 13 August, by request, in absence of the pastor, he led the prayer and conference meeting, and much edified all present by his unusual fervency in prayer, exhortation, and singing. \"What a friend we have in Jesus\" was the last hymn he ever sung with us. On Thursday the 14th, he went to the Sabbath School picnic in most excellent spirits, and seemed to be very happy in the Lord. When time for adjournment arrived, he got out his horse to return home, but seeing a lad in trouble from a fickly horse, he went to his assistance, where he overtaxed his physical strength, and returned to his own buggy quite exhausted. But he got in and took the lines from his niece, to start home, but immediately loosened his hold, dropped them, and fell over backward in his seat, dead. He gave but two slight gasps for breath, and all was over...\n\n\"On Saturday, 16 August, at 2 P.M. his funeral was numerously attended at our chapel, when all the clergy of our village came to observe his obsequies, sympathize with his bereaved family, and participate in the services of the occasion... Medical opinion is divided between apoplexy and heart disease as cause of death.\n\n"}

She moved with her family to Los Angeles, so that she could pursue acting full time. She adopted the surname \"Dennings\" as her professional name when she was younger.\n\nDennings began her career in commercials at the age of 10. Her first acting job was an ad for potato chips. Dennings made her professional debut with an appearance on HBO's \"Sex and the City\" in 2000, in the episode \"Hot Child in the City\", playing an obnoxious 13-year-old who hires Samantha to handle publicity for her bat mitzvah. She then starred on the short-lived WB sitcom \"Raising Dad\" from 2001 to 2002 as Sarah, a 15-year-old raised by her widowed father (Bob Saget), with a pre-teen sister (Brie Larson).

She played Susan Gardner, Bartlett's love interest, and the daughter of the school's principal (Robert Downey, Jr.). Dennings appeared in \"The House Bunny\" that year, as Mona, a pierced feminist sorority girl. She also starred in the teen romance \"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\", with Michael Cera. Dennings played Norah Silverberg, the daughter of a famous record producer, and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for Best Actress for the performance.\n\nIn September 2008, Dennings hoped to make Don DeLillo's novel \"End Zone\" into a film. Actors Sam Rockwell and Josh Hartnett were involved, but the project was not greenlit because of its controversial subject matter of nuclear war.\n\nIn 2009, Dennings appeared in \"The Answer Man\", a story about a celebrity author whose manifestos become a sort of new Bible. She also co-starred in the Robert Rodriguez-directed dark children's film \"Shorts\" that year. She played the protagonist Toe (Jimmy Bennett)'s teenage older sister, Stacey Thompson. Dennings and other rising stars were featured in the August 2009 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", re-enacting scenes from famous Depression-era films, hers being Sydney Pollack's \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" (1969).\n\nDennings was subsequently cast in the romantic comedy film \"Liars (A to E)\". However, the Richard Linklater-directed project was cancelled due to cut backs at Miramax Films by the studio's parent company, Disney. Dennings appeared in the superhero film \"Defendor\" in 2009, starring Woody Harrelson and Sandra Oh, playing a crack-addicted prostitute.\n\nThe following year, she starred in the independent feature \"Daydream Nation\" as a girl who moves from the city to a strange rural town, and is caught in a love triangle with her high school teacher (Josh Lucas) and a teenage drug dealer (Reece Thompson). The film began shooting in Vancouver in early 2010, and was written and directed by Michael Golbach.

The series debuted on September 19, 2011 and follows the lives of two underemployed girls. Beth Behrs co-stars as a Manhattan heiress who lost her inheritance, while Dennings plays a tough outspoken girl from Brooklyn.

According to the text, they lived around 600 BC. They were notable for their rebellion against Lehi and Nephi, becoming the primary antagonists of the First and Second Books of Nephi. They and their descendants became known as the Lamanites, while the descendants of Nephi and their other brothers became the Nephites.\n\nLaman was Lehi's first-born son. He rejected the teachings of his father (in particular Lehi's prophecy of the forthcoming destruction of Jerusalem in 600 BC). He and Lemuel persecuted and beat their brothers Sam and Nephi, who supported Lehi. Because God chose Nephi to lead Lehi's descendants after his death, Laman maintained that he had been robbed of his birthright, resulting in constant wars between the two peoples for nearly 600 years.\n\nIn the Book of Mormon there are incidences of Laman and Lemuel beating or binding up Nephi. On the first occurrence, when they were beating Nephi and Sam with a rod, it tells how an angel visited the brothers, and the angel rebuked Laman and Lemuel. On other occasions, Laman and Lemuel were chastened by the voice of the Lord, or \"shocked\" by divine power.\n\nIn , Lehi's party makes its way from Jerusalem towards the promised land. Verse 5 says that Lehi \"came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea.\" The group traveled for three more days after they had reached \"the borders near the shore of the Red Sea\" before making camp. At this point, they make camp \"in a valley by the side of a river of water.\" Verses 8-10 read:\n\nHugh Nibley, an LDS scholar and apologist, thought this area referred to as \"the borders\" was by Jabal al-Lawz.\n\n\"Lemuel\" (Hebrew:לְמוּאֵל) is the name of a Biblical king mentioned in Proverbs 31:1 and 4, but otherwise unknown. In verse 4, it says, \"Give not to kings, O Lemuel, give not wine to kings ...\" The discourse, which is an exhortation to chastity and temperance, appears to end with verse 9, but might continue through the end of the chapter.\n\nHugh Nibley remarks Lemuel has a \"good pure Arabic name, incidentally.\"\n\nIn \"\", adapted from First and Second Nephi, Laman was portrayed by Mark Gollaher and Lemuel by Cragun Foulger. The portrayals were highly influenced by Arnold Friberg paintings of the characters.\n\nThe film was widely panned by Mormon and non-Mormon critics.. The Austin Chronicle wrote of \"sinister siblings Laman and Lemuel (Gollaher, Foulger) running rampant with Stone Age stilettos and waywardness like some Hebraic version of the Bowery Boys’ Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall\"\n"}

{"id": "3013969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3013969", "title": "Mark Natanson", "text": "Mark Natanson\n\nMark Andreyevich Natanson (; Party name: Bobrov) (25 December 1850 (N.S. 6 January 1851) - 29 July 1919) was a Russian-Jewish revolutionary and one of the founders of the Circle of Tchaikovsky, Land and Liberty, and the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. In 1917, he was a leader of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, supporting the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution. He was the uncle of Alexander Berkman.\n\nMark Natanson was born in 1850 in Švenčionys, Lithuania to a wealthy Jewish family. He studied in St Petersburg at the Medical and Surgical Academy (1868–71) and at the Institute of Agriculture (1871). During this time, he became involved in radical student politics. He opposed the 'nihilistic' tendency of Sergei Nechaev. Natanson participated in founding the vand the populist (\"Narodnik\") organisation 'Land and Liberty' and helped organise some of the first socialist groups among the small industrial working class in Western Russia.\n\nNatanson also took part in demonstrations, notably the Kazan demonstration in St Petersburg in 1876. After 'Land and Liberty' split, Natanson joined 'The People's Will' (Narodnaya Volya). That group favoured agitation among urban workers and intellectuals over propaganda among the peasants (a tactic adopted by the other offshoot of 'Land and Liberty', the 'Black Repartition' group). Narodnaya Volya also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic and in 1881 assassinated Tsar Aleksandr II.\n\nNatanson was not directly involved in any terrorist act, but, in 1877 he was arrested and banished to Siberia until 1889.\n\nAfter his release he returned to European Russia and became active in Saratov, where in 1893 he founded the party People's Rights Party \"(Partiia Narodnogo Prava).\" Historian Shmuel Galai has argued that \"for the first time in the annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy,\" in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.\n\nThe People's Rights Party proved to be a short-lived venture, as in 1894, Natanson was arrested again and banished to eastern Siberia for ten years. Natanson remained an active revolutionary even in Siberian exile, maintaining the party treasury and coordinating various organisational tasks.\n\nIn 1904, after his release, Natanson went into exile in Switzerland and there became involved in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR), which united a variety of populist and revolutionary organisations.\n\nThe tactical position adopted by the PSR represented a compromise between the rural agitation favoured by South Russian and Ukrainian populists, the factory organisation favoured by 'The People's Right' and the terrorist tactic embraced by the remnants of 'The People's Will' and some of the revolutionary groups of Moscow and St Petersburg. During the abortive Russian revolution of 1905–1907, Natanson returned to Russia and served on the central committee of the PSR.\n\nAfter the revolution was put down, Natanson returned to exile in Switzerland.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, the PSR, like most other European socialist parties, split into those who supported a war of 'national defence' ('Defencists') and those who opposed the war ('Internationalists'). Natanson sided with the 'Internationalists' and attended the international socialist peace conferences such as the Zimmerwald Conference and one at Kienthal in Switzerland, signing the conference's manifestoes on behalf of the SR Internationalists.\n\nNatanson returned to Russia in 1917 where he was active in the administration of the PSR.\n\nWhen the February Revolution occurred in Russia in 1917, Natanson returned to Russia and became one of the most prominent leaders of the left wing of the PSR, which became increasingly disenchanted with the Provisional Government and with Alexander Kerensky. The left wing SRs eventually broke away from the PSR and formed a separate party, the Party of Left Socialist Revolutionaries. Natanson and the Left SRs supported the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917 and briefly entered the Soviet government. However, they rejected the Soviet-German peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk (later superseded by the Versailles treaty), which imposed onerous terms on Russia in exchange for a separate peace with Russia.\n\nThe Left SRs exited the Soviet government in protest, and some now took up arms against the Bolsheviks. Natanson opposed this course, fearing that a defeat of the Soviet government would spell the end of the revolution and usher in a counter-revolution. He founded the party of Revolutionary Communists, which supported the Bolsheviks and eventually merged with the Communist Party of the USSR. Natanson was a member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. However, Natanson's opposition to the anti-Bolshevik uprising of the Left SRs did not imply whole-hearted acceptance of the Bolsheviks' policies. In particular, he objected to Lenin's decision to ban all other political parties in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1919, Natanson once again returned to Switzerland and died there.\n\n\n"}

In 1942 WerBell joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and served in China, Burma, and French Indochina. As a guerrilla operative during World War II, he carried out a secret mission for the OSS under the command of Paul Helliwell in China with E. Howard Hunt, Lucien Conein, John K. Singlaub and Ray Cline. They were paid with five-pound sacks of opium. Following World War II, WerBell briefly worked as the director of advertising and public relations for Rich's, a department store in Atlanta, Georgia; he left after a year to open his own PR firm.\n\nAfter WerBell closed his PR Firm to design suppressors (commonly known as \"silencers\", a term which is a misnomer) for firearms, he incorporated SIONICS to design suppressors for the M16 rifle. The name was an acronym for \"Studies In the Operational Negation of Insurgents and Counter-Subversion\". Through SIONICS he developed a low cost, efficient suppressor for machine guns.\n\nIn 1967 he partnered with Gordon B. Ingram, inventor of the MAC-10 submachine gun. They added WerBell's suppressor to Ingram's machinegun and attempted to market it to the U.S. military as \"Whispering Death\" for use in the Vietnam War. WerBell is credited with over 25 different suppressor designs and the \"WerBell Relief Valve\", a mechanism designed for machinegun suppressors. WerBell's modular designs and use of exotic materials such as titanium in sound suppressors influence their design to the present day.\n\nSIONICS was absorbed by the company MAC (Military Armament Corporation) and later called Cobray where WerBell developed a training center for counterterrorism in the 1970s. The courses lasted 11 weeks and students included members of the military, high-risk executives, CIA agents, and private individuals. WerBell concurrently ran Defense Systems International, an arms brokerage firm.\n\nIn the 1950s, WerBell served as a security advisor to Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo and to the Batista regime in Cuba. \nIn 1966 WerBell helped plan an invasion of Haiti by Cuban and Haitian exiles against \"Papa Doc\" François Duvalier called Project Nassau (but internally referred to as Operation Istanbul). The mission, which (according to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Special Subcommittee on Investigations of the House Commerce Committee) was financially subsidized, and to be filmed by CBS news, was aborted when the participants were arrested by the FBI. WerBell was released without being charged.\n\nIn 1972 WerBell was approached by the Abaco Independence Movement (AIM) from the Abaco Islands, a region of the Bahamas, who were worried about the direction the Bahamas were taking and were considering other options, such as independence or remaining a separate Commonwealth nation under the Crown in case of the Bahamas gaining independence (which they did in 1973). AIM was funded by the Phoenix Foundation, a group which aims to help build truly free micronations. The AIM collapsed into internal bickering before a coup by Werbell could be carried out.\n\nIn 1973 WerBell was asked to assist with a \"coup d'état\" against Omar Torrijos of Panama, according to CIA documents released in 1993. WerBell sought clearance from the CIA which denied getting involved in coups. The plan was not implemented, though Torrijos died in a plane crash five years later.\n\nIn a 1979 \"20/20\" interview WerBell claimed that Coca-Cola had hired him for $1 million to take care of kidnapping threats against its Argentine executives during an urban terrorist wave in 1973. Coca-Cola later denied the claim.\n\nLater in life WerBell claimed he was a retired Lieutenant General in the Royal Free Afghan Army or sometimes an Afghan Defense Minister after supplying Afghanistan with large weapons contracts and training. WerBell claimed he was given the billet of Major General in the US Army to allow him to travel freely in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War to demonstrate and sell his silenced submachineguns and sound suppressors. This has been confirmed by Major General John Singlaub and Lt Col. William Mozey.\n\nOther exploits include an alleged, but unsubstantiated, presence at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated; spearheading the 1965 Invasion of the Dominican Republic; being tried and acquitted on charges of conspiracy to marijuana smuggling reportedly in association with Gerry Patrick Hemming and with the acquiescence of Lucien Conein; and providing physical security services and training for Lyndon LaRouche security forces.\n\nIn 1988, Sheriff Sherman Block of Los Angeles announced that \"Hustler\" publisher Larry Flynt wrote WerBell a $1 million check in 1983 to kill Hugh Hefner, Bob Guccione, Walter Annenberg, and Frank Sinatra. Los Angeles television station KNBC displayed a photocopy of the check. WerBell died in Los Angeles a month after receiving the check.\n\nIn the 1989 \"Cotton Club\" murder case of Roy Radin, Arthur Michael Pascal, then owner of a Beverly Hills security firm, testified that prosecution witness William Rider, Flynt's former brother-in-law and private security agent, \"told him of poisoning soldier of fortune Mitchell WerBell III in 1983 in order to take over WerBell's counterterrorist school based in Atlanta. Pascal said that Rider and... Flynt, poured four to six ounces of a digoxin, a powerful heart relaxant, into WerBell's drink during a cocktail party at Flynt's Los Angeles mansion. WerBell, 65, a security consultant for Flynt... died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical Center a few days later.\" Flynt and his attorney, Alan Isaacman, were in Bangkok and \"unavailable for comment, according to a \"Hustler\" magazine spokeswoman\". \"Isaacman characterized an earlier Rider claim of a Flynt-paid murder contract as 'fantasy'.\" Rider passed a polygraph test regarding \"possible involvement in homicides,\" according to courtroom testimony. Pascal was later arraigned on a murder charge due to tapes Rider provided investigators.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Ottoman Army during World War I. He spent much of his early life studying Islamic theology. France gained control of Syria in 1918, establishing a mandate over the country in 1920. By then, al-Ashmar became a prominent Muslim \"sheikh\" based in al-Midan. Al-Ashmar gathered about 40-50 of his men from al-Midan to form part of the civilian volunteer units backing the Syrian forces against the invading French Army at the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July. According to Sami Moubayed, al-Ashmar joined Ibrahim Hananu's militia based in the region of Aleppo.\n\nAl-Ashmar was arrested in 1922 for his earlier participation in the countrywide rebellions and exiled to the southern Hauran region. He managed to return to northern Syria to partake in anti-French activities in the Syrian Coastal Mountains. He was exiled to Amman in Transjordan in 1923.\n\nAl-Ashmar played a leading role as a commander during the Great Syrian Revolt against French rule between 1925 and 1927. He was also an early liaison between the main leader of the revolt, Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, and the notables of Damascus. He was a part of the first Damascene delegation to al-Atrash, who was based in the Hauran region, along with Nasib al-Bakri and Yahya al-Hayati. Al-Ashmar and al-Atrash were supporters of the Hashemites, who had led the Arab Revolt in 1916, ruled Syria until 1918, and were the nominal leaders of Transjordan and Iraq at the time of the 1925 revolt. Al-Atrash designated al-Ashmar as a field commander of the revolt.\n\nOn 17 October 1925, al-Ashmar, along with commander Hasan al-Kharrat, led a rebel assault against the French military in Damascus. His forces set government buildings alight and took over the Azm Palace where the French High-Commissioner, Maurice Sarrail, resided, although he was not present during the assault, which left 180 French military personnel dead. Sarrail subsequently ordered a massive aerial bombardment of the city, resulting in the deaths of 1,500 people. Later that year, al-Ashmar went into exile in Transjordan to escape an arrest warrant for his alleged responsibility in the killing of five French officers. When the French Mandatory government requested that the British authorities in Transjordan arrest al-Ashmar, the British refused, citing his status as a political refugee. He returned to Syria after a general amnesty in 1932.\n\nIn August 1936, al-Ashmar became the second-in-command to Fawzi al-Qawuqji of an Arab volunteer force that arrived in northern Palestine to aid local peasant rebels in the Palestinian Arab revolt against British rule. He commanded the Arab volunteer force's Syrian battalion between August and October 1936. He returned to Syria in late 1936 after a truce was reached. His was celebrated by the residents of Damascus when he arrived in the city. The British requested the French to arrest al-Ashmar for his role in the revolt, but they refused, claiming that the arrest of a popular public figure like al-Ashmar would provoke unrest in Syria.\n\nHostilities resumed in late 1937 after Palestinian Arab objections to the recommendations of the Peel Commission, which called for Palestine's partition into Jewish and Arab states. The newly established, Damascus-based Central Committee of National Jihad in Palestine of exiled Palestinian figures under Hajj Amin al-Husseini's leadership requested that al-Ashmar, along with al-Qawuqji, lead rebel forces in Palestine in November 1937, but this effort was unsuccessful. Al-Ashmar still maintained involvement with the revolt from Damascus and issued \"fatwas\" sought by Palestinian rebel commanders, often Yusuf Abu Durra and Farhan al-Sa'di, for the assassination of specific local Palestinian leaders who they suspected of collaborating with the authorities.\n\nUpon his return to Syria, al-Ashmar agitated for the establishment of a state governed by Islamic law and free of Western influence. He became a strong supporter of the National Bloc leader Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar. He lent his support to Shukri al-Quwatli in the 1943 presidential elections because of the latter's promise to allow Muslim activist organizations more political freedom in return for al-Ashmar's help in gaining votes from the al-Midan quarter. Quwatli won the elections, but abandoned his promises to the Muslim activist groups, angering al-Ashmar and conservative activists throughout the country. They formed movements aimed at removing Quwatli from power and opposing his social liberalism, particularly his permission for cinemas and cabarets to open in the country.\nAl-Ashmar became a popular figure in Syria for his participation in the Syrian and Palestinian anti-colonial revolts. On 19 May 1944, he addressed a crowd of hundreds of conservative Syrian Muslims at the Tankiz Mosque in Marjeh Square, Damascus, strongly condemning the increasing prevalence of unveiled women, cinema and the city's hosting of a charity banquet at the French Officers' Club sponsored by the French-Christian \"Drop of Milk\" society and the wife of then-education minister, Nasuhi al-Bukhari. The speech inspired the crowd to demonstrate against the banquet, with the demonstrations descending into riots. Clashes between demonstrators and the police resulted in the deaths of two protesters, including a 12-year-old boy, in the al-Salihiyah quarter. Al-Ashmar was arrested and sent to the Tadmor Prison in the desert city of Palmyra the following day. The protests subsequently spread to other parts of Damascus, and also Aleppo and Homs, with participants calling for al-Ashmar's release. President Quwatli had al-Ashmar released days later in response to the uproar. Months later, al-Ashmar strongly condemned the Quwatli administration's participation in a women's suffrage conference in Cairo, Egypt in December 1944.\n\nFollowing Syria's independence in 1946, al-Ashmar became a supporter of the Syrian Communist Party. His backing was a major factor in the party's good performance in al-Midan during the 1954 parliamentary elections. He headed the communist Syrian Partisans of Peace and was a member of the World Peace Council. Al-Ashmar was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union in March 1956. He largely retired from politics around this time and died in Damascus in 1960.\n\n"}

{"id": "268869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268869", "title": "Oral Roberts", "text": "Oral Roberts\n\nGranville Oral Roberts (January 24, 1918 – December 15, 2009) was an American Charismatic Christian televangelist, ordained in both the Pentecostal Holiness and United Methodist churches. He is considered the godfather of the charismatic movement and one of the most recognized preachers worldwide. He founded the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and Oral Roberts University.\n\nAs one of the most well-known and controversial American religious leaders of the 20th century, his preaching emphasized \"seed-faith\". His ministries reached millions of followers worldwide spanning a period of over six decades. His healing ministry and bringing American Pentecostalism into the mainstream had the most impact, but he also pioneered televangelism and laid the foundations of the prosperity gospel and abundant life teachings. The breadth and style of his ministry, including his widely publicized funding appeals, made him a consistent subject of contention among critics and supporters.\n\nGranville Oral Roberts was born on January 24, 1918, in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, the fifth and youngest child of the Reverend Ellis Melvin Roberts (1881–1967) and Claudia Priscilla Roberts (née Irwin) (1885–1974). According to an interview on \"Larry King Live\", Roberts was of Cherokee descent. Roberts was a card-carrying member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Roberts began life in poverty and nearly died of tuberculosis at age 17. After finishing high school, Roberts studied for two years each at Oklahoma Baptist University and Phillips University.\nIn 1938, he married a preacher's daughter, Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock.\n\nRoberts became a traveling faith healer after ending his college studies without a degree. According to a \"TIME Magazine\" profile of 1972, Roberts originally made a name for himself with a large mobile tent \"that sat 3,000 on metal folding chairs\".\n\nIn 1945, Roberts resigned his pastorate in Shawnee, Oklahoma to hold revivals in the area and attend Oklahoma Baptist. But in the late summer of 1945, while preaching in a North Carolina camp meeting, Roberts was asked by Robert E. \"Daddy\" Lee of Toccoa, Georgia to consider becoming pastor of his small, eighty-member church. Roberts suggested they pray about it, and unexpectedly, decided to accept. By the end of the year, Roberts resigned and moved back to Shawnee. Apparently, the Georgia conference of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church frowned on having a minister from outside its conference as pastor. Short though it was, the Toccoa detour had a lasting effect on Roberts and his family. It was there that their daughter Rebecca, then five years old, first met her future husband, Marshall. There were also reportedly two instances of healing, which Roberts would later look back on as his first realization \"that I was approaching 'my hour'.\"\n\n1947 was a turning point. Up until that time, Roberts struggled as a part-time preacher in Oklahoma. But at the age of 29, Roberts said, he picked up his Bible and it fell open at the Third Epistle of John where verse two read: \"I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.\" The next day, he said, he bought a Buick and God appeared, directing him to heal the sick.\n\nRoberts resigned his pastoral ministry with the Pentecostal Holiness Church to found Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association (OREA). He conducted evangelistic and faith healing crusades across the United States and around the world, claiming he could raise the dead. In November 1947, he started \"Healing Waters\", a monthly magazine as a means to promote his meetings. Thousands of sick people waited in line to stand before Oral Roberts so he could pray for them. He appeared as a guest speaker for hundreds of national and international meetings and conventions. Through the years, he conducted more than 300 crusades on six continents, and personally laid hands in prayer on more than 2 million people. He also ran direct mail campaigns of seed-faith, which appealed to poor Americans, often from ethnic minorities. At its peak in the early 1980s, Roberts was the leader of a $120 million-a-year organization employing 2,300 people. This included not only a university but also a medical school and hospital as well as buildings on south of Tulsa valued at $500 million. Another part of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, the Abundant Life Prayer Group (ALPG), was founded in 1958.\n\nIn 1963, he founded Oral Roberts University (ORU) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, stating he was obeying a command from God. The university was chartered during 1963 and received its first students in 1965. Students were required to sign an honor code pledging not to drink, smoke, or engage in premarital sexual activities. The Prayer Tower, opened in 1967, is located at the center of the campus.\nRoberts was a pioneer televangelist, and attracted a vast viewership. He began broadcasting by radio in 1947, and began broadcasting his revivals by television in 1954. His television ministry continued with \"The Abundant Life\" program reaching 80% of the United States by 1957, and quarterly Prime Time Specials from 1969 through 1980. In 1996, he founded Golden Eagle Broadcasting.\n\nOn March 17, 1968, Roberts and his wife were received as members of the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Dr. Finis Crutchfield, then pastor. The United Methodist Church offered more leniency in doctrinal and moral issues than the Pentecostal Holiness Church had. This granted Roberts some leeway, as it was expected that the strictness of the Pentecostal tradition may have impeded his rise in popularity. Before Roberts' switch to Methodism, Crutchfield arranged a meeting between Roberts and Bishop William Angie Smith, at which the Bishop told Roberts, \"We need you, but we need the Holy Spirit more than we need you and we've got to have the Holy Spirit in the Methodist Church.\" Roberts became an elder in the Oklahoma Conference of the United Methodist Church. From 1968 through 1987, Roberts was a member of the United Methodist Church's ministry.\n\nRoberts affected the American Protestant community. According to one authority in conservative Protestant culture, his ministry's influence was second only to that of Billy Graham. His divine healing ministry called for prayer to heal the whole person—body, mind and spirit. Many labeled him a faith healer, but he rejected this with the comment: \"God heals—I don't.\" He played a major role in bringing American Pentecostal Christianity into the mainstream. Even though Roberts was often associated with the prosperity gospel and the faith movement because of his close doctrinal and personal ties with Word-Faith teachers, his abundant life teachings did not fully identify him with that movement.\n\nIn 1977, Roberts claimed to have had a vision from a 900-foot-tall Jesus who told him to build City of Faith Medical and Research Center, and the hospital would be a success. In 1980, Roberts said he had a vision that encouraged him to continue the construction of his City of Faith Medical and Research Center in Oklahoma, which opened in 1981. At the time, it was among the largest health facilities of its kind in the world and was intended to merge prayer and medicine in the healing process. The City of Faith operated for only eight years before closing in late 1989, but the importance of treating the whole person—spirit, mind, and body—was conveyed to many medical professionals. The Orthopedic Hospital of Oklahoma still operates on its premises. In 1983 Roberts said Jesus had appeared to him in person and commissioned him to find a cure for cancer.\n\nRoberts' fundraising was controversial. In January 1987, during a fundraising drive, Roberts announced to a television audience that unless he raised $8 million by that March, God would \"call him home.\" However, the year before on Easter he had told a gathering at the Dallas Convention Center that God had instructed him to raise the money \"by the end of the year\" or he would die. Regardless of this new March deadline and the fact that he was still $4.5 million short of his goal, some were fearful that he was referring to suicide, given the impassioned pleas and tears that accompanied his statement. Late in March 1987 while Roberts was fasting and praying in the Prayer Tower, Florida dog track owner Jerry Collins donated $1.3 million. Highly worried from what he perceived as Roberts threatening to starve himself, Collins said, \"I did it in order to save the guy from going to heaven in a hurry. It's got nothing to do with religion. I've been a Baptist and a Methodist. I believe in religion and not just the church. You have to help one another.\" Altogether, Roberts raised a total of $9.1 million. Later that year, he announced that God had raised the dead through his ministry. Some of Roberts' fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, who headed a business writing donation letters for other evangelicals such as Don Stewart and Robert Tilton.\n\nRoberts maintained his love of finery and one obituary claimed that even when times became economically hard, \"he continued to wear his Italian silk suits, diamond rings and gold bracelets—airbrushed out by his staff on publicity pictures\".\n\nHe stirred up controversy when \"Time\" reported in 1987 that his son Richard Roberts claimed that he had seen his father raise a child from the dead. That year, the \"Bloom County\" comic strip recast its character Bill the Cat as a satirized televangelist, \"Fundamentally Oral Bill.\" In 1987, \"Time\" stated that he was \"re-emphasizing faith healing and [is] reaching for his old-time constituency.\" However, the income of his organization continued to decrease (from $88 million in 1980 to $55 million in 1986, according to the \"Tulsa Tribune\") and his largely vacant City of Faith Medical Center continued to lose money.\n\nHarry McNevin said that in 1988 the ORU Board of Regents \"rubber-stamped\" the \"use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so that Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house.\" In addition, he said a country club membership was purchased for the Roberts' home. The lavish expenses led to McNevin's resignation from the Board. In 1988, Oral Roberts and his son Richard were sued for $15 million in federal court by patients at City of Faith Medical Center, claiming the two were frauds who did not visit or heal patients in the hospital.\n\nHis organizations were also affected by scandals involving other televangelists and the City of Faith hospital was forced to close in 1989 after losing money. Roberts was forced to respond with the sale of his holiday homes in Palm Springs and Beverly Hills as well as three of his Mercedes cars.\n\nOral Roberts' son Richard Roberts resigned from the presidency of ORU on November 23, 2007 after being named as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging improper use of university funds for political and personal purposes, and improper use of university resources. The university was given a donation of $8 million by entrepreneur Mart Green, and although the lawsuit was still in process, the school submitted to an outside audit, and with a good report an additional $62 million was given by Green. Oral Roberts continued in his role as ORU chancellor, helping in the leadership of ORU along with Billy Joe Daugherty, who was named as the executive regent to assume administrative responsibilities of the Office of the President by the ORU Board of Regents. Oral Roberts continued as the ORU chancellor until his death, but in 2009, eleven months before his death, handed over the leadership of ORU to its incoming president, Mark Rutland.\n\nThe Oklahoma Senate adopted a resolution honoring the life of Oral Roberts, and he accepted this honor in 2009 at the age of 91, seven months before his death. The Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters (OAB) elected Roberts to the OAB Hall of Fame one month before his death.\n\nRoberts was married to Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock (1917–2005) for 66 years from December 25, 1938, until her death from a fall, on May 4, 2005, at the age of 88. Their daughter Rebecca Nash died in an airplane crash on February 11, 1977 with her husband, businessman Marshall Nash. Their elder son, Ronald Roberts, committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart on June 10, 1982, five months after receiving a court order to undergo counseling at a drug treatment center and six months after coming out as gay. The other two Roberts children are son Richard, an evangelist and former president of Oral Roberts University, and daughter Roberta Potts, an attorney.\n\nRoberts died of complications from pneumonia on December 15, 2009, at the age of 91. He had been \"semi-retired\" and living in Newport Beach, California. He was interred next to his wife at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma (the same cemetery where T. L. Osborn was interred, nearly 4 years after). Roberts was survived by two of four children, twelve grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nAccording to a 1987 article in \"The New York Review of Books\" by Martin Gardner, the \"most accurate and best documented biography is \"Oral Roberts: An American Life\", an objective study by David Edwin Harrell Jr., a historian at Auburn University.\n\n\nAbout Roberts\nBy Roberts\n\n\n \n"}

He played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU), where he won the Chuck Bednarik Award as the best defensive player in the country, the Jim Thorpe Award as the best defensive back, and was unanimously recognized as an All-American. He was selected fifth overall by the Cardinals in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Peterson has been invited to the Pro Bowl in each of his first seven seasons in the NFL.\n\nPeterson was born in Pompano Beach, Florida on July 11, 1990. He attended Blanche Ely High School, where he played running back and defensive back for the Blanche Ely Mighty Tigers high school football team. In his junior campaign, he recorded 11 total touchdowns on offense, while recording seven interceptions and 54 tackles on defense. He also returned three kick-offs for touchdowns and added 10 rushes for 213 yards. As a senior, Peterson compiled 733 yards rushing and 11 touchdowns (9 rushing, one kick return and one punt return). Defensively, he had 21 tackles and five interceptions. Besides numerous All-American team selections, Peterson was named Defensive Player of the Year by \"USA Today\" and played in the 2008 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\n\nHe was also on the school's track & field team, where he ran the 100 meters in 10.92 seconds and the 200 meters in 22.24 seconds. He was also a member of the 4 × 100 m relay (41.41 s) squad.\n\nA consensus five-star prospect by all major recruiting services, Peterson was rated as the nation's fifth best overall player by Rivals.com and No. 8 by \"ESPN\". Prior to his senior season, he verbally committed to play for the University of Miami, but continued to look at other schools. By November 2007, Peterson had reopened his recruiting process and acknowledged interest in Georgia, USC, Florida, and LSU. He later dropped Georgia and USC from his list and added Florida State, but eventually announced his decision to attend LSU at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\n\nPeterson attended Louisiana State University, where he played for coach Les Miles's LSU Tigers football team from 2008 to 2010.\n\nOne of the most decorated high school players to ever attend LSU, Peterson played 13 games as a true freshman. On November 8, against SEC West rival Alabama, he had his first collegiate interception. He started the final four games of season, including the Chick-fil-A Bowl win over Georgia Tech. Peterson finished the season with 41 tackles, one interception, and three pass breakups, while also adding a forced fumble and a quarterback hurry.\n\nIn his sophomore season, Peterson emerged as one of the top defensive backs in the Southeastern Conference. On September 26, against Mississippi State, he had a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown. In a game against standout wide receiver A. J. Green of Georgia, Peterson was able to hold Green to just four catches.\n\nBy mid-season, Peterson tied for fourth in the league with seven passes defended, and was named the SEC's \"Most Improved Player\" by ESPN's Chris Low.\n\nAnother highly anticipated match-up occurred when Peterson went against Julio Jones of Alabama. Peterson's LSU Tigers were ranked 9th in the country and traveled to face Nick Saban and the #1 ranked Crimson Tide. The Tigers were down by six points late in the fourth quarter when Peterson stepped in front of a pass from Greg McElroy to Julio Jones for what seemed like an interception. Multiple CBS camera angles showed that Peterson was able to get at least one foot in bounds. However, even after review, the SEC officiating crew called the pass incomplete, saying that Peterson was not able to get any foot in bounds. Alabama would go on to kick a field goal on that drive and won 24–15. The missed interception call quickly became infamous and was debated by many media outlets.\n\nPeterson finished 2009 with 52 tackles. His 43 solo tackles were second on the team behind linebacker Kelvin Sheppard. Peterson returned an interception for a touchdown against Mississippi State, and he returned a blocked field goal against Ole Miss for a touchdown. He was also named a 2009 Second-Team All-American by \"The Sporting News\", a 2009 First-Team All-SEC performer by ESPN, and a 2009 Second-Team All-SEC performer by the AP.\n\nPeterson was named to the preseason watch lists for the Nagurski Award, the Thorpe Award, the Ronnie Lott Award, the Walter Camp Award, and the Chuck Bednarik Award. It was announced during the summer of 2010 that Peterson would begin returning punts and kickoffs due to his size, speed, and athleticism. With this added dimension to his game, and his dominance as a cornerback, Peterson began being mentioned as a dark horse for the 2010 Heisman Trophy award, presented to the best college football player every year. Only one defensive player has ever won the Heisman Trophy, Charles Woodson.\n\nPeterson began his Heisman campaign against North Carolina in the 2010 Chick-fil-A Kickoff. The Tigers won 30–24 and Peterson was terrific. In his debut as a returner, Peterson had a school-record 257 yards returning punts and kickoffs, 244 yards coming in the first half. He returned a punt 87 yards for a touchdown and consistently gave the Tiger's offense good field position. His 257-yard performance ranks second all-time in the SEC behind Mississippi State's Nick Turner and his 266-yard performance. Peterson was named Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance. He was also named the Lott IMPACT Player of the Week.\n\nPeterson had two punt returns against Vanderbilt for 8 yards in week two as the Tigers rolled past the Commodores. He also returned two kickoffs for 51 yards, to go along with one tackle.\n\nIn week three of the 2010 season, the 2–0 Tigers hosted 1–1 Mississippi State for LSU's first home game of the year. The Tiger defense suffocated Mississippi State's offense and Peterson strengthened his campaign with two acrobatic interceptions for LSU. He also returned one kickoff 39 yards and one punt 2 yards to go along with four solo tackles.\n\nPeterson entertained the home crowd again in week four against Top-25 foe West Virginia. With the game tied 0–0 early in the first quarter, West Virginia went to attempt a mid-range field goal and Peterson was able to leap from behind the line of scrimmage and block the kick. The Tiger defense forced West Virginia to punt later in the half. Peterson fielded the punt on his own 40-yard line and raced 60-yards up the middle of the field for a touchdown and a 17–0 LSU lead. Peterson struck the Heisman pose in the North end zone of Tiger Stadium, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Peterson was almost single-handedly responsible for 10 points in the game that ended with LSU winning 20–14. The national sports media began comparing Peterson to Woodson, who actually had worse statistics than Peterson through his first four games during his Heisman winning season. Peterson was again named SEC Special Teams Player of the Week. He also recorded 1 solo tackle.\n\nWeek five saw the LSU Tigers take on the Tennessee Volunteers. Peterson and the LSU defense limited Tennessee to 217 yards of offense and the Tigers won 16–14. Peterson recorded 1 solo tackle and 3 assisted tackles. He had 3 punt returns for 30 yards and 3 kickoff returns for 64 yards. The LSU Tigers improved to 5–0 and 3–0 in the SEC with the victory over the Volunteers.\n\nPeterson's efforts helped the Tigers to a No. 12 ranking in the Associated Press Top 25 as well as a No. 9 ranking in the USA Today Coaches Poll Top 25. Through week 5 of the 2010 season, he was 3rd in Division 1-A in punt return average at 23.6 yards per attempt (12 for 283), 1st in punt return touchdowns with 2, and 22nd in kickoff return average at 28.2 yards per attempt. Peterson was also tied for 30th in the country with two interceptions. He was in the top five of most straw polls regarding the 2010 Heisman Trophy. In an effort to jumpstart the struggling offense for the Tigers, Peterson practiced as a wide receiver and a running back on offense.\n\nOn October 9, against the Florida Gators, Peterson had four kick returns for 106 net yards, one punt return, and one total tackle in the 33–29 victory. In the next game, against McNeese State, he had two kick returns for 63 net yards and two punt returns for 34 net yards to go along with one tackle. In the following game, against Auburn, he had four kick returns for 99 net yards, two punt returns for 18 net yards, and three total tackles. On November 6, against Alabama, he had two kick returns for 45 net yards, two punt returns for 22 net yards, eight total tackles, and three passes defended in the 24–21 victory. The next week, against Louisiana–Monroe, he had three punt returns for 31 net yards, one total tackle, and an interception that was returned 85 yards. In the following game, against Ole Miss, he had four kick returns for 121 net yards, three punt returns for 30 net yards, four total tackles, and one interception. On November 27, against Arkansas, he had four kick returns for 163 net yards, three total tackles, and one pass defensed. In his final collegiate game, the Cotton Bowl against Texas A&M, he had three kick returns for 81 net yards to go along with six total tackles.\n\nFollowing the season, he was a first-team All-SEC selection, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\nComing out of LSU in 2011, Peterson was a projected first round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was a consensus top five pick and was thought to be the best player in the draft by multiple analysts. Peterson attended the NFL combine and completed all of the required combine drills. On March 14, 2011, he participated at LSU's pro day and opted to stand on his combine numbers and only perform positional drills for scouts and team representatives. Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach Mike Tomlin, Carolina Panthers' head coach Ron Rivera, and New Orleans Saints' head coach Sean Payton were among the team representatives that attended LSU's pro day to scout Peterson, Kelvin Sheppard, Drake Nevis, Joseph Barksdale, Stevan Ridley, Lazarius Levingston, Terrence Toliver, and multiple others. He was ranked the top cornerback prospect in the draft by NFL analyst Mike Mayock, NFLDraftScout.com, Foxsports analyst Brian Billick, and \"Sports Illustrated\".\nThe Arizona Cardinals selected Peterson in the first round (fifth overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. He was the first cornerback selected.\n\nOn July 30, 2011, the Arizona Cardinals signed Peterson to a fully guaranteed four-year, $18.42 million contract that included a signing bonus of $11.90 million.\n\nOn August 27, 2011, Peterson intercepted a pass from Philip Rivers and returned it for a touchdown on his first play in a preseason game against the San Diego Chargers.\n\nHead coach Ken Whisenhunt named Peterson the starting cornerback, alongside Greg Toler, to begin his rookie season. He started the Arizona Cardinals' season-opener against the Carolina Panthers and scored his first career touchdown after returning a punt for an 89-yards in the fourth quarter to win the game 28-21. Peterson also recorded five solo tackles during the game. The following week, he recorded a season-high eight combined tackles as the Cardinals lost 21-22 to the Washington Redskins. On September 25, 2011, Peterson made one tackle, defended a pass, and made his first career interception, picking off a pass from Seattle Seahawks' quarterback Tarvaris Jackson during a 10-13 loss.\n\nOn November 6, 2011, during the overtime period, Peterson fielded a punt at the one-yard line, evaded several would-be tacklers, and returned it for the 99-yard touchdown in a 19-13 victory over the St. Louis Rams. He also intercepted a flea-flicker pass from Sam Bradford intended for Brandon Lloyd an recorded three tackles and three pass deflections. In Week 14, he led the Cardinals with five solo tackles and made the first sack of his career on San Francisco 49ers' quarterback Alex Smith during 21-19 victory for the Cardinals.\n\nHe tied the single-season record for punt return touchdowns with his fourth, accomplishing the feat against St. Louis on November 27. He became the only player in NFL history with four punt-return touchdowns of at least 80 yards in a single season. He finished his rookie season with a sack, 64 combined tackles (59 solo), two interceptions, 13 passes defended, and two fumble recoveries in 16 games and 16 starts. He also produced a rookie record 699 return yards for four touchdowns on 44 punt returns.\n\nPeterson was selected as a kick returner to the 2012 Pro Bowl and was the only rookie to be selected to the 2011 All-Pro First Team.\n\nPeterson returned as the starting cornerback, opposite William Gay, to begin the season. On September 16, 2012, Peterson had one carry for 17-yards, three combined tackles, a pass deflection, and intercepted Tom Brady in a 20-18 victory over the New England Patriots. On December 16, 2012, he recorded a season-high seven combined tackles and intercepted Detroit Lions' quarterback Matt Stafford in a 38-10 victory. The interception marked his seventh of the season.\n\nPeterson started all 16 games making 55 tackles with seven interceptions, 17 passes defended, and a NFL-leading five fumble recoveries. He also had 51 punt returns producing 426 return yards, three receptions for 11 receiving yards, and two carries for 13 rushing yards. On December 26, 2012, it was announced that Peterson was voted to the 2013 Pro Bowl as a cornerback.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals' new head coach Bruce Arians named Peterson the starting cornerback, opposite Jerraud Powers, to begin the season.\n\nOn September 15, 2013, Peterson caught one pass for 17-yards, threw a 17-yard pass to Kerry Taylor, and recorded four solo tackles during a 25-21 win against the Detroit Lions. This made him the first defender to catch and complete a pass in the same game since the 1970 merger. On September 29, he recorded two solo tackles and intercepted two passes from Tampa Bay Buccaneers' quarterback Mike Glennon during a 13-10 victory. It was the first game of Peterson's career with multiple interceptions. In Week 14, Peterson collected a season-high seven combined tackles in a 37-34 victory over the Tennessee Titans. Although the Cardinals finished with a 10-6 record in their first year under Bruce Arians, they finished third in their division and did not qualify for a playoff berth.\n\nPeterson started all 16 games in 2013 and made 42 combined tackles (40 solo), three interceptions, 13 pass deflections, and two fumble recoveries. He also returned 33 punts for 198 return yards, had one kickoff return attempt for 18-yards, made six catches for 54 receiving yards, and had four carries for 21-yards. He was selected for the 2014 Pro Bowl as a cornerback, marking the third of his career.\n\nOn July 29, 2014, the Arizona Cardinals signed Peterson to a five-year, $70 million contract extension with $48 million guaranteed and a $15.3 million signing bonus.\n\nHe began the season as the Arizona Cardinals' starting cornerback, opposite Antonio Cromartie, and no longer had to handle return duties due to the arrival of Ted Ginn Jr. On November 9, 2014, he made two solo tackles and intercepted two passes from St. Louis Rams' quarterback Austin Davis during a 31-14 victory. He returned one interception for a 30-yard touchdown, marking the first defensive touchdown of his career. On December 7, Peterson recorded a season-high eight combined tackles and sacked Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback Alex Smith in a 17-14 victory. He finished the season with 50 combined tackles (43 solo), eight pass deflections, three interceptions, a forced fumble, and three fumble recoveries in 16 games and 16 starts. He was selected to the 2015 Pro Bowl as a cornerback, marking his fourth straight appearance.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals finished with an 11-5 record in 2014 and qualified for a playoff berth. On January 3, 2015, Peterson played in his first career postseason game and recorded two combined tackles during a 16-27 lost to the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Wildcard Game.\n\nShortly after the 2014 NFL season, Peterson announced that he had been diagnosed with diabetes. He stated that this affected his performance in the 2014 season, that he had the disease under control, and was ready for the 2015 season.\n\nPeterson was named the starting cornerback and had full-time punt return duties after the departure of Ted Ginn Jr.\n\nOn September 20, 2015, he recorded three solo tackles and intercepted Jay Cutler during a 48-23 win over the Chicago Bears. In Week 5, he collected four combined tackles and intercepted a pass off Matthew Stafford, as the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Detroit Lions 42-17. The following game, he earned a season-high five solo tackles as the Cardinals were defeated by the Pittsburgh Steelers 13-25. Although he started all 16 games, Peterson finished with a career low 35 combined tackles (35 solo), eight pass deflections, and made two interceptions.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals finished first in the NFC West with a 13-3 record, receiving a playoff berth, home field advantage, and a first round bye week. After defeating the Green Bay Packers 26-20 in the NFC divisional round, the Cardinals went on the face the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Championship. Peterson recorded five combined tackles and returned an interception off Cam Newton for 70 yards, as the Cardinals lost 49–15.\n\nHe was selected to the 2016 Pro Bowl as a cornerback, marking his fifth straight, and was voted third first-team All-Pro. He was also ranked 18th best player by his fellow NFL players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.\n\nPeterson began the season as the starting cornerback, opposite Marcus Cooper, with full time punt return duties being taken over by John Brown with Peterson returning sparingly throughout the season.\n\nOn September 18, 2016, Peterson recorded four combined tackles and intercepted Jameis Winston during a 40-7 victory. In Week 3, Peterson recorded four combined tackle and intercepted Tyrod Taylor, catching the ball with one hand during a 18-33 loss to the Buffalo Bills. On December 24, 2016, he collected a season-high six combined tackles in a 34-31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. He recorded 51 combined tackles (45 solo), six passes deflected, and three interceptions in 16 games and 16 starts. On December 20, 2016, Peterson was selected to be in the 2017 Pro Bowl, along with teammates Larry Fitzgerald and David Johnson. This was Peterson's sixth straight Pro Bowl. He was also ranked 19th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 as the highest ranked cornerback.\n\nPeterson remained as the Cardinals' \"de facto\" starting cornerback with Justin Bethel after Marcus Cooper departed in free agency. In a Week 11 game against the Houston Texans Peterson got his first Interception of the season, a one handed grab off Tom Savage. On December 19, 2017, Peterson was named to his seventh straight Pro Bowl. Overall, he finished the 2017 season with 13 punt returns for 88 net yards, 34 total tackles, one fumble recovery, eight passes defensed, and one interception.\n\nIn week 1 against the Washington Redskins, Peterson had 1 tackle and 1 sack on quarterback Alex Smith. In week 2 against the Los Angeles Rams, Peterson made 8 tackles and intercepted quarterback Jared Goff once. In week 7 against the Denver Broncos, Peterson made 6 tackles and intercepted quarterback Case Keenum once.\n\n\n\nPeterson went by the last name \"Johnson\" when he signed with LSU, but formally changed it to \"Peterson\" in August 2008. His parents are Patrick and Shandra Peterson of Fort Lauderdale, FL. He is a relative of NFL players Bryant McFadden, Walter McFadden, Sinorice Moss and Santana Moss (his maternal cousins).\nPeterson's younger brother, Avery Johnson (who has also changed his last name to \"Peterson\"), was a member of the \"ESPNU\" 150 Watch List in 2012.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Peterson revealed he has type two diabetes.\n\n"}

{"id": "57794465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57794465", "title": "Rudolf V. Perina", "text": "Rudolf V. Perina\n\nRudolf Vilem Perina () (January 3, 1945 – June 14, 2018) was an American diplomat who specialized for more than three decades in European East-West relations during and after the Cold War, and on the Dayton Accords following the dissolution of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. This includes working the 1988 Moscow summit meeting between President Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev, during the former's first visit to the USSR. He also served as ambassador to the Republic of Moldova, U.S. Special Negotiator for Eurasian Conflicts in the former Soviet Union (an ambassador-level position), Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian Affairs in the State Department, director of European and Soviet Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council, and was on the policy planning staff of the State Department under Colin Powell before and after the invasion of Iraq.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the foreign service, Perina served as Chargé d’Affaires at U.S. embassies including those in Chisinau, Moldova (2006), Yerevan, Armenia (2007), Reykjavik (2010), Prague (2013), and Bratislava, Slovakia (2015).\n\nPerina was born on January 3, 1945 in the town of Tábor in what is today the Czech Republic. His father's family owned a large lumbermill serving Central Europe. His mother's family was subject to Nazi reprisals during World War II, including the execution of his grandfather and great uncle on June 10, 1942. The family members were executed in a coordinated purge of Czech nationalists and public figures that culminated in the razing of the town of Lidice.\n\nPerina and his parents fled Czechoslovakia following the 1948 Communist takeover of the government. Rudolf's mother paid a Croat border smuggler to transport her son in January 1950 to the border into Austria and eventually to Zurich where his father had escaped. The family lived as refugees in Switzerland and Morocco before immigrating to the United States via Le Havre, France in 1951.\n\nHe grew up speaking Czech at home. In 1955, the family moved to Cleveland and Perina obtained US citizenship the following year.\n\nAfter the family moved to Seattle, Perina attended Franklin High School where he made valedictorian in 1963. He chose the University of Chicago as it offered him full tuition with a stipend. He earned his B.A. degree in history there in 1967 and did his graduate studies at Columbia University where he received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in European history, with the idea of going into academia. While studying in New York, he was hired by a film production company to consult and interpret for the filming of a documentary about the 1968 reform movement in Czechoslovakia known as the “Prague Spring.” This led to the topic of his Ph.D dissertation: “Intellectuals and Political Change in Czechoslovakia: A History of Literarni noviny and its Contributors, 1952-1969.” He had also earned a Foreign Area Fellowhip to research his dissertation at the library of Radio Free Europe for two years.\n\nPerina was at Columbia during the 1968 student protests. While supportive of the US civil rights movement and against the Vietnam War, he maintained a moderate political position, saying later \"I became suspicious of all political extremism and radicalism, whether right-wing or left-wing. It is a position I have held all of my life.\"\n\nReturning from Europe to finish his dissertation, Perina found that there were few academic jobs available in the U.S. He saw an ad for the foreign service exam and encouraged by the example of foreign-born Henry Kissinger, he took it and passed. Delighted to find that it paid better than any academic job, he started in November 1974, his first posting at the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa, Canada through 1976 during which time both of his daughters were born.\n\nAt this post, Perina gave Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn his first US visa, whereby he communicated to him in German. (Already fluent in Czech and French, Perina became fluent in Russian later.) He found that the author of \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\" and other works \"took the process more seriously than almost any other applicant\" he had processed up to that time. In reflecting on Solzhenitsyn's conscientiousness later, Perina concluded that \"if you spend your life fighting a bureaucracy, your first thought is to not make a mistake in an official document that the bureaucracy can use against you.\"\n\nAt Ottawa, Perina also had responsibilities in the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) whose Helsinki Final Act was signed by the 35 participating states in the summer of 1975.\n\nHe was then posted to Moscow, and was there during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Upon witnessing the confrontation with 1st Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Korniyenko, he said later he was \"shown for the first time how unashamedly people can lie in diplomacy.\" The US response to the invasion was tough, and included suspending exchanges, diplomatic social events, wheat sales, and eventually boycotting the Moscow Olympics, bringing Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and part of Eastern Europe along as well. Of the time, Perina has said, \"our relations with the Soviets there were very competitive. We were always watching what they did, and they watched us.\"\n\nAlthough compared to average Soviet citizen, he lived better, Perina has described that life in the Soviet capital \"could be difficult.\" During the harsh winters, he had to remove his car battery each night to prevent its freezing. The Perinas also saw firsthand the psychological warfare the KGB enacted on US embassy personnel, Perina describing his wife Ethel's coat disappearing for several months then reappearing in their closet.\n\nHe then started to work at the U.S. Mission in West Berlin in 1981. The US saw East Berlin differently from the GDR. Considered a Soviet zone, the Americans maintained another embassy in East Berlin, and the mission in West Berlin avoided dealing with the East Germans by going to the Soviets for things related to them. (The Soviets on the other hand respected the city as part of the GDR and the capital of East Germany.) Perina also described that in Berlin in 1981 it was so easy for the four occupying powers, which included the UK and France, plus East and West Germany, to spy on each other being in such close proximities that \"the city with more espionage going on per square mile than any other city in Europe.\" He said that \"There was alot of eavesdropping.\"\n\nAs liaison with the Soviets on Russian matters, Perina said that \"Nobody seriously thought there was going to be a World War III or an invasion of Berlin by the Warsaw Pact.\" The diplomat also never got the sense things were loosening up in the USSR. Although he personally did not know whether the Strategic Defense Initiative system (SDIs) would even work, he understood that the Soviets were threatened by the possibility: He said, \"They realized their strength as a world power came from possession of nuclear weapons, and not from their GDP or anything else.\" (There was talk too in Germany about NATO deployment of immediate range nuclear missiles.)\n\nPerina served as interpreter between ambassadors Arthur Burns and Piotr Abrassimov, then Vyacheslav Kochemasov during their twice yearly social lunches. There was bureaucratic protocol too that had to be observed whenever the West German president came to Berlin—the US, French, and British embassies had to greet him formally—which Perina described as a \"real nuisance.\" He also witnessed the tensions in Poland: The country was moving toward martial law, and Perina describes that by the end of his time there, he and his colleagues were witnessing six or seven Polish plane hijacking to West Berlin a year. He also saw the rivalry between the two Germanies, but felt the real threat at the time was from radical groups like the Baader-Meinhof gang.\n\nPerina then worked at the U.S. Mission to NATO in Brussels from 1985, as political officer and deputy US representative to the organization's political committee. The group was handling three simultaneous negotiations, on Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), and SDIs for a number of visits by President Reagan to the North Atlantic Council, according to Perina, \"the most comprehensive arms control discussion between the US and the Soviet Union.\" The diplomat's impression of NATO was that it was an American-run organization, with the allies all deferring to the US.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1989, Perina was director for European and Soviet Affairs on the National Security Council staff: prior to his arrival there had been a purge from the Iran Contra scandal. He was brought in by Colin Powell who'd been hired by new National Security Council Advisor Frank Carlucci who ran the department differently, and better, in Perina's opinion. Perina had the Soviet portfolio, which included working on Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" speech. Yet even with this, the Czech-American had no suspicion that the empire was on the verge of collapse, saying \"it was not even part of any discussion... We were all watching the top, the Kremlin ... [W]e did not pay enough attention to the internal situation and particularly to the nationality issues.\" In preparation for the 1988 meeting between the two world leaders, Perina asked the CIA to make a film for Reagan about the Moscow sites the president would be visiting and organized a lunch for him with Soviet experts in the US: It would be Reagan's first visit to the USSR.\n\nPerina attended the 1988 Moscow summit meeting between Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev, the third of only four total people; he later described the tension between the two principals being rooted in different negotiating styles: The Soviet's being deductive and the American's inductive. And although he found the American president very gracious, Perina found the leader of the USSR the more important historical figure \"among the most important of our time.\" He described the former Hollywood actor as having \"good instincts\" but that he \"clearly did not have the grasp of substance that Gorbachev had.\" Perina believed the summit was significant symbolically, that it influenced Reagan, the Russian people's opinion on Reagan, and changed the dynamics of the US-Russia relationship.\n\nPerina was also in charge of the NSC's Eastern European portfolio and visited Romania under Nikolai Ceausescu. He described it as a \"desperate place\" where there was no heat or electricity, and hardly any food in its stores. He said he could see clearly \"the fear everyone so clearly had in their eyes,\" even those around the Rleader himself. Perina left the NSC in spring 1989 when President Bush and Brent Scowcroft instituted a complete shift in personnel for political reasons.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, Perina was deputy chairman of the U.S. Delegation to the Vienna negotiations on Confidence and Security Building Measures in Europe (CSBM), held under auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\n\nFrom 1993 to 1996, he was Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia with the title of Charge d’Affaires and worked with a downsized staff. The country was under UN sanctions, and extreme inflation had forced the country to depend on the black market. Embassy matters were all handled on a cash basis: Perina describes having tens of thousands of dollars driven in from Budapest, Hungary in an unguarded car so as not to arouse suspicion from the gangs who then ruled the streets.\n\nPerina worked with Richard Holbrooke as liaison to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic during the negotiations to end the Yugoslav conflict. (Some considered Holbrooke's work to have merited the Nobel Peace Prize later.) They had a dozen meetings with the Serbian ruler with others around, then met him one on one because they found him more engaging in that capacity. Perina saw a \"genuine lack of compassion that was truly frightening\" and said that this feeling extended to his treatment of his countrymen, the Serbs. Perina also participated in the talks held in Dayton, Ohio, to which he credits Milosevic's assent, although mostly for self-serving purposes: The leader thought he would gain respectability in the international community and sanctions would be lifted. Perina also met with Ibrahim Rugova, the elected president of the Republic of Kosovo, whom along with Macedonia's Kiro Gligorov Perina found to be the most impressive leaders in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nPerina served as Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs; in 1996-97 the majority of his time was spent helping to execute the Dayton Accords from Washington DC while John Kornblum travelled to implement them. This included the outer wall of sanctions that enraged the Serbs and did not satisfy Kosovar Albanians (They would form the Kosovo Liberation Army.) As the former USSR was now handled by the Office of Newly Independent States (NIS) and not the European bureau, the other third of Perina's time was spent on helping to expand NATO, which he said he felt ambivalence towards: The powerful organization did not help integrate the Russians into Europe and damaged the US's relationship to Russia. He has said \"I fear the way we handled revanchism made it a self-fulfulling prophecy.\" He saw and was shocked by Sarajevo at the end of the war, which described as \"miles and miles of just rubble.\" Perina has said European and Canadian Affairs was one of his least favorite because it was so bureaucratic and based in the US capital.\n\nPerina was assigned and confirmed ambassadorship to the Republic of Moldova, serving from 1998 to 2001. He studied Romanian and reviewed his Russian before starting and found the former Soviet republic \"a much more pleasant place\" than he had imagined: \"The people were extremely friendly and hospitable, and the country was a very interesting place to work.\" His job was to help it develop into a successful, autonomous nation. It was one of the earliest to privatize land, helped by a major USAID project that completed under Perina: The US gave over $50 million in assistance, the third highest amount given to a former Soviet republic, because of its cooperation and its efforts at reform. Several hundred Moldovans were sent to the US every year on exchange programs; Perina was also particularly proud of the Peace Corps contingent he saw there.\n\nMoldava was a main source of the trafficking of women from the former Soviet Union: Many young women were lured into the trade with promises of jobs as nannies and waitresses in Western Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East. The embassy tried to combat this with educational programs and financing a documentary film with victim testimonies that were shown in schools, on billboards and on national TV.\n\nHe was in Moldova during the Transnistrian conflict, and though the US was not one of the three official mediators (those being Russia, the Ukraine, and the OSCE), the heads of the OSCE mission were American because the Moldovan government wanted to counterbalance their former rulers. Regardless, Perina met with Moldovan Presidents Petru Lucinschi then Vladimir Voronin on policy toward Transnistria, even initiating dialogue with the breakaway eastern region's so-called president, Igor Smirnov.\n\nPerina describes these half dozen talks with Smirnov as disheartening. This is because the disputed region had become a staging area for smuggling operations that avoided taxes and customs duties. Ukrainians and Moldavans alike profited off the illegal importation of cigarettes, liquor, and \"many other commodities\" that hurt the republic in lost tax revenue. Another problem was the 40,000 tons of aging Soviet ammunition stored at Cosbasna base in Transnistria: The US was a major contributor of several million dollars to a voluntary OSCE fund to aid in arms withdrawal and though there was a limited destruction of tanks and a half trainload of weapons and ammunition, Russian troops and old but still dangerous armaments were kept in the region for political leverage. The economic conflict of the region was also rooted in a lot of Moldava's industry being located in Transnistria, planned by Stalin.\n\nPerina became the U.S. Special Negotiator for Nagorno-Karabakh and Eurasian Conflicts from 2001, flying out on September 23 when the US airports were reopened after 9/11. The ambassador-level job was Washington D.C.-based but involved a great deal of travel: He was the lead U.S. representative to international efforts to resolve four conflicts in territories of the former Soviet Union: Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia (Chechnya was the fifth former territory that also had strife but Russia did not let outside influence on it).\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict had roots in the 1990s war between Armenia and Azerbaijan: Perina called it a \"true indigenous conflict\" between the two countries. The OSCE and its specially created Minsk Group handled the crisis, with many proposals by the latter rejected by both nations, represented by Presidents Kocharyan and Aliyev respectively, over the years. The first meeting of what came to be known as the Prague Process took place outside the capital at Stirin Palace in mid-May 2002, a location that Perina helped arranged for. During the US diplomat's tenure through 2004, it remained a stalemated conflict lacking peacekeeping troops to maintain the separation between the sides with a few soldiers on both sides killed monthly by sniper fire. Perina\n's 2002 idea of a referendum became the major consideration by 2004: The idea being that residents of Nagorno-Karabakh before hostilities would be able to vote, using lists from the Soviet era. With the intransigence of the two sides, in the end, the conflict was frozen; Perina said of it \"the most you can hope for is stabilizing this conflict rather than really resolving it.\"\n\nThe Abkhaz were an ethnic minority who participating in the ethnic cleansing of several hundred thousand Georgians in the 1990s with the help of Russians and Chechens. There were 200,000 refugees that resulted. In Perina's view, \"The hatred between [the two groups] was the worst I had ever seen in either the Balkans of the Caucauses\" calling it \"even greater than that between the Serbs and the Albanians.\" The negotiating process over Abkhazia stalled but its very existence reduced pressure on the Georgian side for military action against it.\n\nThe hostility in South Ossetia was a result of the succession by an ethnic group in Georgia that didn't want to be a part of an independent Georgia, didn't accept its sovereignty, and was protected in this by Russia. The disaccord, per Perina, nevertheless the most promising of the conflicts as the \"hatred was not as deep.\" He felt that most of the population would have welcomed a settlement. The EU was interested in aiding but the Russians blocked them.\n\nPerina kept working on the Transnistria in ex-officio capacity as the US was not one of the designated mediators. A mandate to resolve this conflict would have institutionalized Russia's presence in Moldava. Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian federation Dmitry Kozak attempted to head off the involvement of other countries by arranging for their own settlement for Vladmir Voronin to sign, giving Transnistria de facto veto power over big Moldavan policy decisions. When the Moldavans got wind of the memorandum, 50,000 demonstrated in its capital. There was also Georgia's Rose Revolution, which ousted President Shevardnadze out, and Veronin was successfully talked out of signing.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Perina served as deputy director of the State Department's Policy Planning staff. He worked under both Colin Powell then Condi Rice, and the latter focussed only on Iraq and the Middle East. Perina found it bizarre that within the State Department, there was little debate on the decision to invade the former. (There were also no experts on the Muslim world in the department.) \"The tipping point came imperceptibly, and suddenly everyone just assumed we would invade. The Afghanistan invasion ... appeared to have been successful.\" He witnessed the policy tensions between Donald Rumsfeld of the Defense Department and Powell on the issue of responsibility for the administration of Iraq. As no one was prepared to do it, and the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization was created in the State Department which would have a coordinator and a small staff of about a dozen who would come up with action plans and lists of experts including those outside of government to deal with humanitarian assistance, training police, instituting civil authority, and the like.\n\nUnder Powell, Perina went to sub-Saharan Africa with an expert to start policy consultation with the African Union. He witnessed the rapid radicalization of Muslim communities on the continent by means of the madrassas staffed by Middle Eastern teachers. The Bush administration faulted the foreign service for this, refusing to see it connected to the invasion of Iraq. Powell, whom Perina called \"probably the best Secretary I have worked for\" was also the first major leader to name what was happening in Darfur as genocide, calling for a peacekeeping force but no country was up to it. Perina credits humanitarian organizations for relief supplies and food.\n\nPerina officially retired on April 30, 2006, after 32 years in the foreign service.\n\nIn 2007 Perina became the Chargé d’Affaires at U.S. embassies for Armenia, 2010 for Iceland, 2013 the Czech Republic, and 2015 for Slovakia.\n\nIn 2007, Perina completed an oral history of his life and career for Frontline Diplomacy: the Foreign Affairs Oral History Collection of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. It is available online through the Library of Congress.\n\nHe was the Scarff Visiting Professor of International Relations at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin in fall 2010 and was on the Council of Advisors of the Wende Museum, a research institute and archive of the Cold War located in Culver City, California.\n\nHe met his wife, Ethel Ott Hetherington, at the 1968 Columbia student protests, and they married in Salzburg, Austria on May 26, 1972. Ethel taught at the International School of Belgrade while he was Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy there in the '90s. He was fluent in four languages: English, Czech, Russian, and French and knew Romanian. They have two daughters, Kaja and Alexandra, and four grandchildren and lived in the Washington D.C. area until his death on June 14, 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "451068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=451068", "title": "Samuel Sewall", "text": "Samuel Sewall\n\nSamuel Sewall (; March 28, 1652 – January 1, 1730) was a judge, businessman, and printer in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, best known for his involvement in the Salem witch trials, for which he later apologized, and his essay \"The Selling of Joseph\" (1700), which criticized slavery. He served for many years as the chief justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature, the province's high court.\n\nSewall was born in Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England, on March 28, 1652, the great grandson of Henry and Jane () Sewall. His father, son of the mayor of Coventry, had come to the English North American Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635, where he married Sewall's mother, and returned to England in the 1640s.\n\nFollowing the restoration of Charles II to the English throne, the Sewalls again crossed the Atlantic in 1661, settling in Newbury, Massachusetts. It is there the young Samuel \"Sam\" grew up along the Parker River and Plum Island Sound.\n\nLike other local boys he attended school at the home of James Noyes, whose cousin, Reverend Thomas Parker, was the principal instructor. From Parker, Sewall acquired a lifelong love of verse, which he wrote in both English and Latin. In 1667 Sewall entered Harvard College, where his classmates included Edward Taylor and Daniel Gookin, with whom he formed enduring friendships. Sewall received his first degree, a BA, in 1671, and his MA in 1674. In 1674 he served as librarian of Harvard for nine months, the second person to hold that post. That year he began keeping a journal, which he maintained for most of his life; it is one of the major historical documents of the time. In 1679 he became a member of the Military Company of Massachusetts.\n\nSewall's involvement in the political affairs of the colony began when he became a freeman of the colony, giving him the right to vote. In 1681 he was appointed the official printer of the colony; one of the first works he published was John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\". After John Hull died in 1683, Sewall was elected to replace him on the colony's council of assistants, a body that functioned both as the upper house of the legislature and as a court of appeals. He also became a member of Harvard's Board of Overseers.\n\nSewall's oral examination for the MA was a public affair and was witnessed by Hannah Hull, daughter of colonial merchant and mintmaster John Hull. She was apparently taken by the young man's charms, and pursued him; they were married in February 1676. Her father, whose work as mintmaster had made him quite wealthy, gave the couple £500 in colonial currency as a wedding gift. (Biographer Richard Francis notes that the weight of this amount of specie, , may have approximated the bride's weight, giving rise to Nathaniel Hawthorne's legend that the gift was her weight in coins.) Sewall moved into his in-laws' mansion in Boston, and was soon involved in that family's business and political affairs. He and Hannah would have fourteen children before her death in 1717, although only a few survived to adulthood.\n\nHe also entered local politics, and was elevated to the position of assistant magistrate in the judiciary. In 1692 he was one of the nine judges appointed to the court of Oyer and Terminer in Salem, charged with trying those from Salem Town and elsewhere who were accused of witchcraft. His diary recounts many of the more famous episodes of the trials, such as the agonizing death under torture of Giles Corey, and reflects the growing public unease about the guilt of many of the accused. Sewall's brother Stephen had meanwhile opened up his home to one of the initially afflicted children, Betty Parris, daughter of Salem Village's minister, Samuel Parris, and shortly afterward Betty's \"afflictions\" appear to have subsided.\n\nSewall was perhaps most remarkable among the justices involved in the trials in that he later regretted his role, going so far as to call for a public day of prayer, fasting, and reparations. Following the dissolution of the court, the Sewall family was blighted by what Sewall thought to be punishments from God. In the five years after the Trials, two of Sewall's daughters and Hannah's mother died and Hannah gave birth to a stillborn child. What convinced Sewall of his need for public repentance was a recitation of Matthew 12:7, \"If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless\". Not only had Sewall's home life been shaken, but in the years after the Trials, the people of Massachusetts experienced setbacks and violence, notably the Navigation Acts, the declaration of the New England Dominion, and King Philip's War. He saw this as a sign not that witchcraft did not exist, but that he had ruled on insubstantial evidence. He records in his diary that on 14 January 1697 he stood up in the meeting house he attended while his minister read out his confession of guilt.\n\nIn 1693 Sewall was appointed an associate justice of the Superior Court of Judicature, the province's high court, by Governor Sir William Phips. In 1717, he was appointed its chief justice by Governor Samuel Shute.\n\nSewall died in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1730, aged 77, and was interred in the family tomb at Boston's Granary Burying Ground.\n\nSewall married three times. Hannah Hull, his first wife, died in 1717; two years later, in 1719, Sewall married Abigail (Melyen) Woodmansey Tilley, who died seven months later. In 1722, he married Mary (Shrimpton) Gibbs, who survived him. His nephew Stephen also served as a Massachusetts chief justice, as did his great grandson Samuel. His sister Anne Sewall Longfellow (1662–1706) was the great-great-great-grandmother of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\nApart from his involvement in the Salem witch trials, Sewall was somewhat liberal in his views for the time. In \"The Selling of Joseph\" (1700), for instance, he came out strongly against slavery, making him one of the earliest colonial abolitionists. \"The Selling of Joseph\" was the earliest-recorded anti-slavery tract published in the future United States. In it, Sewell argued, \"Liberty is in real value next unto Life: None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon the most mature Consideration.\" He regarded \"man-stealing as an atrocious crime which would introduce among the English settlers people who would remain forever restive and alien\", but also believed that \"There is such a disparity in their Conditions, Colour, Hair, that they can never embody with us, and grow up into orderly Families, to the Peopling of the Land.\" Although holding such segregationist views, he maintained that \"These Ethiopians, as black as they are; seeing they are the Sons and Daughters of the First Adam, the Brethren and Sisters of the Last ADAM [meaning Jesus Christ], and the Offspring of God; They ought to be treated with a Respect agreeable.\"\n\nHis essay \"Talitha Cumi\", first published in 1725, refers to the \"right of women.\" When the periwig became fashionable in New England, Sewall condemned the fashion vehemently, in contrast to Cotton Mather, who saw no reason why a Puritan should not wear a wig. Sewall's \"Journal\", kept from 1673 to 1729, describes his life as a Puritan against the changing tide of colonial life, as the devoutly religious community of Massachusetts gradually adopted more secular attitudes and emerged as a liberal, cosmopolitan-minded community.\n\n\nWorks written by Sewall include:\n\n\n"}

She is believed to be the last of eagle doctors, a Comanche title referring to a person with eagle medicine for healing the sick. She was influenced by traditional Comanche medicine, incorporating elements of Christianity and Peyotism.\n\nSanapia was born Mary Poafpybitty in spring 1895 to David Poafpybitty and Chappy Poafpybitty, both Comanche, living near Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Although it has been written that she was born on May 20, 1895, she was uncertain of her actual birthdate so this date was adopted later on. She was sixth of eleven children but the first girl to be born in her family. While she was young, her family struggled to make ends meet and lived in poverty, relying on rations from nearby Fort Sill. She was raised by her maternal grandmother.\n\nAlthough Sanapia did not begin a career as a medicine woman until her mid-teens, from a very young age she received training from her mother and her maternal uncle, an Arapaho chief, both of whom were eagle doctors. Although her father, David, was a Christian and indifferent to Comanche spiritual practices, he did not interfere with the religious training of his daughter. She attended Cache Creek Mission School in southern Oklahoma from the age of 7 until 14 and during the summer holidays would develop a knowledge of herbal medicines.\n\nBetween the ages of 14 and 17 she received full-time training from her mother, uncle, and paternal grandfather to attain the knowledge, ethics, skills and the supernatural powers (\"paha\") to become a medicine woman. The latter, attaining supernatural powers, would be achieved by transferring power through the medium of the hands and mouth, using various methods such as hot coals into her hands, two eagle feathers inserted into her mouth and the egg of an eagle into her stomach. The visionary aspects of the training were achieved through prolonged periods of solitary meditation and spiritual nurturing and intensive reiterating by her mother that evil spirits such as ghosts and demons would harm her, which terrified her. Her uncle named her \"Sanapia\", which means \"Memory Woman\".\n\nAfter her training was completed, a marriage was arranged for her. It was an unhappy one; however, the couple did have one son. She left her first husband and married a second time, a marriage which lasted until her husband's death in the 1930s. From her second marriage, Sanapia had a son and daughter. Her second husband died when Sanapia was 35. She was overcome with grief, and she drank heavily, gambled, and was promiscuous. Then one day, Sanapia healed the sick child of her sister. This event was a spiritual reawakening, and she took it as a sign to denounce her bad ways and became a serious medicine woman.\n\nSanapia remarried around 1945, and after menopause, she began her healing practice. She began to have frequent dreams related to the peyote ritual which she believed was a gift from the Christian God to the Native American people. She healed many people using a medical kit of both botanical and non-botanical medicines, such as sneezeweed to treat heart palpitations, low blood pressure and congestion, mescal bean for ear problems, rye grass for the treatment of cataracts, red cedar to ward off ghosts, prickly ash to treat fever; iris for colds, broomweed for dermatological ailments etc. Her most important medicine was peyote. She was only prevailent in using the body parts of dead animals such as beef fat for mouth burns, white otter fur and porcupine quills for children, fossilized bone to treat wounds and infections and even a Bible to pray for power.\n\nDuring her career she was particularly adept as healing facial paralysis, now known as Bell's palsy which she believed was inflicted upon the victim by an evil ghost. Sanapia believed that the ghost throws a feather into the body of the affected patient and unless it is removed the patient will die. However, she did not believe that the ghost physically placed a feather in a body, but rather placed the essence of it within the individual to inflict pain. She would heal the victim by asking them to bathe in a stream, followed by a prayer to the eagle to help heal her patient, and smudging the patient with cedar smoke. She would then chew on milkweed and place in on the part of the body which was affected by the paralysis and would then suck on the affected part of the patient's face with a cow horn to draw out the sickness. During the healing she was often obtain four or so eagle of crow feathers and fan the patient to ward of evil spirits. If the treatment was ineffective, Sanapia would pray apply peyote tea to the patient's face, head, and hands and if the patient needed her deepest powers of healing she would sing a song until she attracted the spririts to help her.\n\nSanapia was buried in the Comanche Indian cemetery near Chandler Creek, Oklahoma. Her activities were documented by David E. Jones in \"Sanapia, Comanche Medicine Woman\", from 1967, with Sanapia's permission. She adopted Jones as her son, otherwise it would be a wrongdoing to pass down information about the traditional healing to an outsider. Sanapia's purpose was for the book to serve as a form of autobiography, to pass the knowledge which she had acquired down to the next generation and to encourage others to follow in her footsteps in being a traditional medicine woman and healer. None of her children, however, were interested enough in spiritual healing to follow in her footsteps.\n\n"}

{"id": "4195869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4195869", "title": "The Fox and the Cat", "text": "The Fox and the Cat\n\nThe Fox and the Cat (, the names sequence is reversed as \"gatto\" means \"cat\" and \"volpe\" means \"fox\") are a pair of fictional characters who appear in Carlo Collodi's book \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" (\"Le avventure di Pinocchio\"). Both are depicted as con-men, who lead Pinocchio astray and unsuccessfully attempt to murder him. The pair pretend to sport disabilities; the Fox lameness and the Cat blindness. The Fox is depicted as the more intelligent of the two, with the Cat usually limiting itself to repeating the Fox's words.\n\nPinocchio encounters the two after leaving Mangiafuoco's theatre with five gold coins, whereupon the Fox claims to know Pinocchio's father Mister Geppetto and proposes to Pinocchio to visit the Land of Barn Owls (\"Paese dei Barbagianni\") and thence to a 'Field of Miracles' (\"Il campo dei Miracoli\"), where coins can be grown into a money-producing tree. A white blackbird warns Pinocchio against these lies, but is eaten by the Cat. The Fox covered up this action by claiming that the blackbird talks too much. The pair lead Pinocchio to the Red Prawn Inn (\"Osteria del Gambero Rosso\"), where they eat a large meal and ask to be awoken at midnight.\n\nTwo hours before the set time, the pair abandon Pinocchio to pay for the meal with one of his coins and has the innkeeper leave a message for Pinocchio that the Cat's eldest kitten had fallen ill, and that they would meet Pinocchio at the Field of Miracles later. When Pinocchio leaves the inn, the two attack him in disguise of murderers, and in the ensuing struggle, Pinocchio bites off the Cat's paw. The murderers then hang Pinocchio from a tree, which he escapes with the assistance of The Fairy with Turquoise Hair who enlisted a falcon to cut him down.\n\nThe next day, Pinocchio encounters the pair again unaware that they are the murderers that hung him. When Pinocchio notices the Cat's paw in a sling, the Fox claims that the Cat cut it off to feed a starving wolf. They lead Pinocchio to the town of Catchfools (\"Acchiappa Citrulli\"), where the coins are soon buried. In Pinocchio's absence, the pair dig up the coins and escape. Pinocchio learned of this from a parrot who mocked him for falling for their tricks.\n\nNear the end of the book, Pinocchio encounters the Fox and the Cat again when looking for a place for Geppetto to recuperate. This time, the pair have become impoverished, whereas the Fox is now truly lame, nearly hairless, and tailless (the Fox had to chop off his own tail to sell for money), and the Cat truly blind. They plead for food or money, but are rebuffed by Pinocchio (having learned of their tricks and presumably realizes that they were the ones who tried to murder him) while stating that it serves them right for their wickedness. He then leaves, all the while saying goodbye to his \"false friends.\"\n\nIn the 1940 Disney film \"Pinocchio\", the Fox and the Cat are given the names John Worthington Foulfellow or \"Honest John\" (voiced by Walter Catlett) and Gideon (whose three hiccups were provided by Mel Blanc). The pair differ from their original counterparts in a number of ways; they do not feign disability, and it is they who persuade Pinocchio to join Stromboli's puppet show and coax him to go to Pleasure Island, upon being hired by The Coachman. However, upon hire, Foulfellow and Gideon are concerned with the Coachman's proposition of luring children to Pleasure Island as it is deemed off limits by the authorities. Their worries are confirmed when the Coachman reveals the reason for his plan, along with his face changing to include more sinister features, frightening the two into agreement. Apart from his three hiccups, Gideon is mute. Though portrayed as scoundrels, they never go as far as attempting to murder Pinocchio, although Honest John suggests strongly to the Coachman that they will if that's the proposed job. The subplot of the Field of Miracles is absent. The villains' ultimate fate is that they are arrested by the police when they encounter Pinocchio a third time in some way, but the scene in which this occurred ended up being deleted from the final draft of the film. Foulfellow is portrayed as an eccentric ham actor whereas Gideon's mannerisms resemble Harpo Marx of the Marx Brothers It was up for consideration to use the characters again in the 1947 Disney film \"Fun and Fancy Free\" as the owners of the Magic Beans Mickey Mouse acquires in exchange for his cow, but the idea was dropped.\n\nThe duo were set to make an appearance in the 2009 RPG video game \"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\" but were cut for space restrictions.\n\nIn the Disney book \"Pinocchio's Promise\", Foulfellow and Gideon see Pinocchio walking into town to give a cuckoo clock to Gepetto's friend Mrs. Ramono whereupon he is diverted to a circus. Foulfellow attempts to sell the clock elsewhere while Gideon takes Pinocchio to the circus with two expired tickets, but abandons the boy when the latter is scolded by the admission attendant. Pinocchio reports Foulfellow's trickery to the local police. Foulfellow and Gideon are arrested by the police and Pinocchio gives the clock to Mrs. Ramono.\n\nIn a Disney book adaption of the tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", the two, posing as tailors, trick the emperor (portrayed in the same book by Prince John).\n\n\nOften the \"Field of the miracles\" has been mistaken with the poetic phrase \"Square of the miracles\" that is used since the second half of the 20th century to describe the Piazza del Duomo of Pisa. The monuments of the famous square had been called \"miracles\" by Gabriele D'Annunzio in his book \"Forse che sì, forse che no\" (1910). Several famous squares in Italy being called \"campo\" and the story of Pinocchio being widespread in the World, many people, in and outside Italy, tend to confuse the two.\n\n"}
{"id": "21860619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21860619", "title": "Tsali", "text": "Tsali\n\nTsali (), originally of Coosawattee Town (\"Kusawatiyi\"), was a noted leader of the Cherokee during two different periods of the history of the tribe. As a young man, he followed the Chickamauga Cherokee war chief, Dragging Canoe, from the time the latter migrated southwest during the Cherokee–American wars. In 1812 he became known as a prophet, urging the Cherokee to ally with the Shawnee Tecumseh in war against the Americans.\n\nLater, during the 1830s roundup of Cherokee for Indian Removal, Tsali, his wife and brother, his three sons and their families were taken by surprise and marched at bayonet point toward the Indian Agency on the Hiwasee River. When Tsali's wife paused to care for the needs of her baby, one of the guards whipped her and prodded her with his bayonet, to force her on her way. According to a secondhand account by Wasidana, Tsali's son, the mother and baby were forced onto horseback and, in the process, \"she got her foot hung in the stirrup. Then her baby dropped. It went that way, out yonder, and bust the head. And it died right then.\" In response, a surprise attack was made on the soldiers, one guard was killed and the rest wounded or subdued. Tsali and his relatives fled to the mountains and hid out in a cave in the Smoky Mountains. His successful evasion was reported to the other Indians by grapevine and soon the mountain Cherokees by dozens, then by hundreds, joined him in the hideout, living off roots and berries on the border of starvation.\n\nGeneral Scott was baffled by the situation. He had not the troops to track down Indians in that impervious and secret region. Nor was he certain that he wanted to. But if Tsali's freedom went unchallenged, a fateful example would be set for other Cherokees. Scott enlisted the services of William Thomas, a white trader who had lived for twenty years among the North Carolina Indians and had their confidence. Thomas was given a message to the leader of the fugitives. If Tsali and his family would surrender themselves to military justice, the rest of the Cherokees in the mountains could remain free.\n\nHe and his brother and sons came down from the mountains and gave themselves up. Tsali's youngest boy Wasidana was spared; the others were executed. According to Wasidana, they were shot by a firing squad of Cherokee prisoners, compelled to the act as a means of impressing on the Indians the hopelessness of their position.\n\nTsali's martyrdom, however, marked not a hopeless end but a beginning. The three hundred fugitives remaining free became the forebears of some five thousand Cherokees living today in the North Carolina mountains, legatees of the once-proudest Nation in Native American Indian history. And Tsali's story survives close to the scene of its original enactment, in the annual presentation of a Cherokee drama entitled \"Unto These Hills\".\n\nDuring the turbulent years leading up to the War of 1812 and the Creek War, Tsali first became known as a major figure on the Cherokee national scene. The teachings of Tenskwatawa, known as the \"Shawnee Prophet\", began to filter down to the Native Americans of the Southeast, where they sparked a traditionalist cultural and religious revival. Tenskwatawa was the brother of the Shawnee leader Tecumseh, who led a pan-Indian resistance against the Americans.\n\nTenskwatawa's influence inspired what the later anthropologist James Mooney called the \"Cherokee Ghost Dance movement.\" This revival increased Tecumseh's fame. He visited the council of the Upper Muscogee and representatives of the other tribes of the Southeast at Tuckabatchee. He called on them to band together, abandon the ways of acculturation, and take up arms together in a united war against the Americans.\n\nThe Cherokee National Council had sent a small delegation led by The Ridge to hear Tecumseh. He was generally well received but, when Tecumseh asked the Cherokee delegation when he could speak to their National Council, The Ridge replied that if Tecumseh set one foot inside the Cherokee Nation The Ridge would kill him. The chief considered Tecumseh a threat to Cherokee stability, although he had fought alongside many of the Cherokee leaders in the late 1780s during the Cherokee–American wars.\n\nSome weeks after that Council, the 1812 New Madrid earthquake struck, affecting the entire continent of North America, with aftershocks for weeks afterwards. The legend spread that after his rejection by the Cherokee at Tuckabatchee, Tecumseh had promised that when he returned home, he would stomp his foot down on the earth so that the anger of the Great Spirit would come upon the Earth.\n\nIn a Council meeting at Ustanali some weeks later, the traditionalist prophet Tsali from the town of Coosawattee came to speak. He was eloquent in favor of alliance with Tecumseh. The Ridge, widely acknowledged as the best orator among the Cherokee Nation, argued against what he had said. Supporters of Tsali attacked The Ridge, who was saved by the intervention of a friend.\n\nThe Ridge's defiance of Tsali caused the prophet to lose face with the Council, which had been at the point of voting nearly unanimously to support Tecumseh's war. Tsali prophesied a great apocalypse for the Cherokee Nation and said the only safe haven would be the Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina, to which he then departed.\n\nThe National Council refused The Ridge efforts to gain support for the Americans in their conflict with the British during the War of 1812. The Council got involved in the Creek War only after being recruited by the Lower Muscogee.\n\nAfter the 1835 Treaty of New Echota, the federal government began to round up Cherokee in preparation for the forced removal to what was to become Indian Territory. When the soldiers came into the small group of farmsteads owned by Tsali's extended family in the Snowbird Mountains of western North Carolina, they were attacked, and some of them killed.\n\nBoth John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation and Yonaguska, Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, condemned Tsali's actions. They offered to capture him and his warriors—in the strongest of terms—and offered to help run him and his family down. Yonaguska was given the task, and asked for assistance from his friend Utsala on the Nanthahala River, hoping to gain him permission to stay in the state as compensation for his effort. The Cherokee captured Tsali and his family, and executed him and two of his sons. The rest of his large family was allowed to remain under the umbrella of the Eastern Band.\n\nTsali Boulevard, a major artery of traffic in Cherokee, North Carolina, is named in his honor.\n\nA highly fictionalized account of the affair can be seen at the Qualla Boundary in the play \"Unto These Hills\", which was written by Kermit Hunter in 1950. New, updated versions have been written.\n\n"}

He has also sung in various other languages including Maithili, Nepali and Bhojpuri. He has won 4 National Film Awards (3 as a singer 1 as a producer) and 5 Filmfare Awards with 20 nominations and many other awards. He is the only male singer in the history of the Filmfare Awards to have won in over three decades (the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s). Udit Narayan was awarded the Padma Shri in 2009, and in 2016 he was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India, an honour that has been awarded to only a handful of singers, in recognition of his achievements in various film industries across India. He was awarded the Prabal Gorkha Dakshin Bahu by the King of Nepal Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev in 2001 and Chitragupta Cineyatra Samman 2015 for Bhojpuri Cinema. As many as 21 of his tracks feature in BBC's \"Top 40 Bollywood Soundtracks of all time\".\n\nUdit Narayan was born in 1955 to Nepali father Harekrishna Jha and Indian mother Bhuvaneshwari Jha. In 2009, when Udit Narayan was awarded India's civilian honour \"Padma Shri\", there were reports questioning his Indian citizenship, claiming that he was born in Nepal. However, Udit Narayan himself branded these reports as \"completely false\", and stated that he was born in the Baisi village of Supaul district of Bihar at his maternal grandparents' home. When his acceptance of the \"Padma Shri\" led to his criticism in Nepal, he told the Nepalese daily \"Kantipur\" that he was \"from Nepal but his mother's home was in Bihar.\" In a 2017 interview with the Indian magazine \"Outlook\", he clarified that he was born in Baisi, and clarified that his father Harekrishna was a native of Bhardaha, Saptari District, Sagarmatha Zone, Nepal. In September 2018, Udit Narayan revealed at a ceremony held by the Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America, that he identifies as a Bihari.\n\nNarayan studied at Jageshwar High School, Kunauli, Supaul, Bihar, India, where he finished his SSC and later obtained his intermediate degree from Ratna Rajya Lakshmi Campus, Kathmandu, Nepal. His father Harekrishna Jha was a farmer and his mother Bhuvneshwari Devi was a folk singer. His mother encouraged him to pursue music as a career.\n\nIn 2006, Ranjana Narayan claimed to be the Narayan's first wife, but Narayan consistently denied it. Later, he accepted her as his wife and promised to provide for her maintenance. Narayan has been married twice, first to Ranjana Narayan Jha and then to Deepa Narayan Jha. He began his relationship with Deepa Narayan while he was still married to Ranjana Narayan. Narayan and Deepa were married in 1985. With Deepa Narayan, he has one son, Aditya Narayan, who is also a playback singer.\n\nNarayan's work has been praised by his contemporaries Alka Yagnik, Kavita Krishnamurthy and music director Ankit Tiwari. \"Mid Day\" included him in the list of notable 90s playback singers. Narayan is considered one of the most prominent singers of his generation.\n\nHe was one of the most prominent ustads (teachers) of Bollywood singers throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. He has been the on-screen singing voice for various Bollywood stars. He has also sung with Bollywood actors Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna and Dev Anand. Most of his duets are with Alka Yagnik. He began his career in 1970 as a Maithili folk singer (staff artist) for Radio Nepal, singing mostly popular folk songs in Maithili and Nepali. Gradually, he started singing modern Nepali songs. After eight years, Narayan moved to Bombay on a musical scholarship for Nepalese from the Indian Embassy in Nepal to study classical music at Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan.\n\nNarayan started his Bollywood career in 1980 when he was noted by music director Rajesh Roshan, who asked Narayan to playback sing for the Hindi film \"Unees-Bees\". Narayan was given the opportunity to sing with the legendary singer Mohammed Rafi. He sang for Devanand a couplet in Swami Dada.His first duet was in the film Sannata. Soon after, Narayan sang for a number of other movies, including \"Bade Dil Wala\" in 1983, where he sang a duet with senior singer Lata Mangeshkar, composed by senior music director R. D. Burman. In the same year, Narayan sang with Kishore Kumar in the film \"Kehdo Pyar Hai\". Another singer he sang with was Suresh Wadkar with music composed by Bappi Lahiri. A significant milestone in his career occurred in 1988 when Anand-Milind gave him the opportunity to sing all the songs for the successful Bollywood movie \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\", with Alka Yagnik, which earned him a Filmfare Award. In an interview with The Times of India, Narayan said: \"The song I've sung, \"Manzilein\", is the best song of my career after \"Pehla Nasha\", which gave me superstardom!\". Narayan remained prolific through the 2000s, singing popular numbers in films such as \"Pukar\", \"Dhadkan\", \"Lagaan\", \"Devdas\" and \"Veer Zaara\".\n\nIn 2002, Narayan sang \"Bairi Piya\" with newcomer Shreya Ghoshal, from the film \"Devdas\", of which Rediff mentioned: \"Narayan successfully captures the eternal romanticism of Devdas\". In 2014, Narayan sang a song titled \"Naa Hum Jo Kah De\" along with Shreya Ghoshal, for the album \"Women's Day Special: Spreading Melodies Everywhere\". The song was composed by Ram Shankar and penned by A. K. Mishra.\n\nNarayan's friend Jiyand Nawab Deedag suggested he change his work from old to modern in order to be selected as a playback singer, but this didn't work and, considering old films in 1973, Narayan sang a song for a Nepali film called \"Sindoor\". This was a comedy song for the famous Nepali comedians GopalRaj Mainali (Chankhe) and Basundhara Bhushal (Nakkali). Narayan sang this song with Sushma Shrestha, now known as Poornima in Hindi films. Narayan has also acted in two Nepali films – \"Kusume Rumal\" and \"Pirati\" in 1985.\nIn 2004, he released his first non-movie Nepalese album, \"Upahaar\", in which he sang duets with his wife Deepa Jha.

This occurred during the political campaign for the Dutch general elections of 2002. An environmental and animal rights activist, he said at his trial that he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" and targeting \"the vulnerable sections of society\" in seeking political power.\n\nVan der Graaf was arrested shortly after shooting Fortuyn, who died immediately. In court, van der Graaf testified that he had become alarmed that Fortuyn was using Muslims and immigrants as scapegoats in a campaign to seek political power. He thought the politician endangered society with his controversial statements. His trial started on 27 March 2003. He was convicted on 15 April 2003 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The trial generated large interest from the Dutch public, especially Fortuyn supporters. Van der Graaf appealed for the reduction of the sentence to 16 years, but on 18 July 2003, the appeals court upheld the previous sentence. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two thirds of his sentence.\n\nVan der Graaf was born in Middelburg, in the province of Zeeland. By the time he attended university in Wageningen, he had become a vegan and an advocate of animal rights. At the time of the murder he lived with his girlfriend and their infant daughter in Harderwijk.\n\nVan der Graaf worked for the environmental organisation Vereniging Milieu Offensief in Wageningen, which he had co-founded in 1992. His job involved challenging violators of environmental regulations through litigation. He concentrated particularly on contesting practices in intensive animal farming and fur farming. He was said to be highly motivated, working more than the four days per week of his contract. He was successful at litigation, winning about three out of every four cases.\n\nOn 6 May 2002 Pim Fortuyn was shot and killed outside a radio studio in Hilversum at 6:00 pm, just after he finished an interview. Interviewer Ruud de Wild witnessed the murder.\n\nVan der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as \"Volkert van der G.\", in accordance with unwritten Dutch privacy practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on web sites used by Fortuyn's supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder.\n\nThe details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn's appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of cartridges found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route.\n\nVan der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally: a semi-automatic Star Firestar M43 pistol in a café in Ede and 9mm cartridges in The Hague. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in Emmen through DNA material found on the weapon.\n\nOn the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards Hilversum, knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of 3FM in the Media Park. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his stubble, which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving fingerprints. The razor did not work.\n\nHe had never visited the Mediapark, relying on a map and a couple of photos to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn's interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn's car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn's interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours.\nFortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn's ducking away or a bullet mistakenly hitting somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times, and fired a sixth shot that missed.\n\nRunning away, Van der Graaf was chased by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Mediapark onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arms length at Smolders. He had been reporting their position to the police by mobile phone. Reaching a gas station, Van der Graaf gave up when police pointed their pistols at him.\n\nFor several months Van der Graaf refused to make any statement about the murder, on the advice of his lawyers. He was represented by Böhler, Koppe and Franken, with Franken leading.\n\nIn the months following the murder, many conspiracy theories were put forth by supporters of Fortuyn and others. Officials investigating the murder dismissed these popular rumours, declaring that no evidence had been found for the involvement of others. No evidence was found to support rumors that Van der Graaf had committed the earlier murder in 1996 of Chris Van der Werken, an environmental official from Nunspeet, or that he had attended other appearances by Fortuyn.\n\nOn 7 July 2006, the national daily newspaper \"De Telegraaf\" published an article alleging Van der Graaf's connection with the murder of Van der Werken. \"De Telegraaf\" printed extracts of a secret police report on the murder of Van der Werken on its website. Quirijn Meijnen, a Dutch-based media lawyer who represented Van der Graaf, said the accusations were grave and unfounded, and that the publication of extracts of the secret police report infringed Van der Graaf's privacy rights. \"De Telegraaf\" failed to mention that Van der Graaf was never a suspect in the murder case of Van der Werken.\n\nAfter Van der Graaf's arrest, he was held in strict isolation until 1 June. He could speak only to his lawyers and police and justice officials. He was kept under constant observation by video camera.\n\nA second search of Van der Graaf's home on 24 June found a chemical mixture, calcium chlorate and sugar, hidden in 35 condoms in his garage. Nearby were flasks of sulphuric acid. Experts said the substances could be combined to make a fire bomb or explosive material. Van der Graaf later said that he had fabricated the materials around 1990–1992 for experimentation purposes and had forgotten about them.\n\nThe first \"pro forma\" hearing in his trial started on 9 August, which Van der Graaf watched on television from his cell in the Bijlmerbajes prison. The prosecution outlined its evidence, which included the finding of DNA matching Fortuyn on Van der Graaf's clothes and gun, matching of the bullets used in the attack with the gun, and eyewitnesses who pursued him continuously from the murder scene to the point of arrest. The defence complained that lack of discretion in reporting by the press and statements by public officials would make it difficult to obtain a fair trial. It requested calling as witnesses several politicians who had made public comments about the murder, including the past and present Prime Ministers Wim Kok and Jan Peter Balkenende, as well as various members of Lijst Pim Fortuyn including Herben and Janssen van Raay.\n\nOn the morning of 3 September, Van der Graaf's girlfriend was arrested at her workplace in connection with the chemicals found at their former home. Her lawyer and the lawyers of Van der Graaf denounced this as an attempt to pressure Van der Graaf into making a statement. She was released two days later and eventually cleared of any suspicion after Van der Graaf made a statement on her behalf.\n\nDuring a second \"pro forma\" hearing on 4 November, it was decided that the trial would be delayed while Van der Graaf was sent for seven weeks of psychiatric observation at the Pieter Baan Centre, starting in the first week of January 2003. In a press statement of 23 November, the prosecution (Public Ministry) announced that Van der Graaf had confessed to the murder. He said he planned it for some time and that nobody else was involved in the plans or knew about them. He believed Fortuyn was a steadily increasing danger for vulnerable groups in society. He saw no other possibility than to end the danger by killing Fortuyn.\n\nIn response to the confession, Mat Herben said he was still not convinced that Van der Graaf had acted alone. Fortuyn's brother Marten said he was not surprised by the confession but feared that Van der Graaf was setting himself up as \"saviour of the fatherland\".\n\nThe confession has not been made publicly available. Reports have asserted that Van der Graaf said he was \"not proud\" of the deed. He said if he could consider the decision again, he wouldn't do it. He said that he did not see himself as \"the saviour of the Netherlands\" or as a martyr.\n\nOn 6 January 2003, Van der Graaf was moved to the Pieter Baan Centrum (PBC) to begin the seven-week behavioural investigation. Disagreements between the Ministry of Justice and the management of the PBC over the conditions of his supervision delayed it. The Ministry wanted Van der Graaf under video surveillance 24 hours per day and isolated from other patients for his own safety. The PBC believed such cameras would prevent establishing the trust needed for the multi-disciplinary behavioural investigation. It took responsibility to supervise him in a small group so that the investigation could proceed optimally. On 20 January, Van der Graaf said he was suspending his cooperation for the investigation. The Minister of Justice, Piet Hein Donner, resolved the dispute by dropping the demands for video surveillance and isolation.\n\nOn January, 29th, 2003 a third \"pro forma\" hearing was held in which the dates for the trial were set. Since the subject of the trial was expected to be not so much the question of the guilt of Van der Graaf, but instead the degree of the punishment, the report of the Pieter Baan Centrum was considered highly significant, in case it found that he was of \"diminished responsibilities\". After the completion of the investigation on 14 March, he was returned to his prison cell in the Bijlmerbajes.\n\nThe report from the PBC was complete by about 21 March. It found that Van der Graaf could be held completely accountable for the killing. The report also stated that Van der Graaf has a severe personality disorder, which explains his rigid moral judgements. Menno Oosterhoff, a child psychiatrist from Groningen, publicly suggested that the Pieter Baan Centrum may have overlooked the possibility that Van der Graaf has Asperger syndrome. Oosterhoff later withdrew his theory. The PBC report stated that nothing could be said about the chance of another similar crime occurring, since the disorder had nothing to do with the murder. Van der Graaf agreed that he was accountable and that he had compulsive urges. The outcome of the investigation ensured that he would receive a prison sentence and not \"TBS treatment\".\n\nThe trial was held in a high-security court in Amsterdam-Osdorp over three days: 27 March, 31 March and 1 April. About 15 supporters of Fortuyn demonstrated outside the building, with banners such as \"for less than 20 years we will smash the place up\", \"better fortuynist than socialist\" and \"the leftist church is criminal\". The proceedings were followed by about 80 people, including a woman who disturbed the occasion by screaming at Van der Graaf, accusing him of such things as \"destroying the whole of the Netherlands\". Van der Graaf was counselled by the high-profile German-born attorney, Britta Böhler.\n\nVan der Graaf was charged with the premeditated murder of Fortuyn, two counts of possession of illegal weapons, namely the gun and the explosive mixture at his house, and a charge of threatening the life of Fortuyn's chauffeur by pointing his gun at him during the chase following the murder.\n\nThe prosecutor asked for life imprisonment for the killing, saying that an example must be set for anybody else attempting to frustrate the democratic process through criminal means. He said the crime was serious because of its victim and the consequences, and that to a certain degree it was a \"political murder\". Van der Graaf had irrevocably damaged the democratic political progress of Fortuyn, and had done it intentionally. For an exceptional crime, he deserved an exceptional punishment.\n\nDuring the trial, Van der Graaf described his reasons for killing Fortuyn. He had hoped that the leaders of other political parties would criticize Fortuyn, but that it never happened. Fortuyn had the talent to channel criticism so that it never touched him. Van der Graaf said he had spoken to no one about his plan. He finished his planning just the day before the murder. He was wrestling with regret for the killing, finding the killing of somebody morally reprehensible. On 6 May he had felt justified, wanting to fight the danger of what Fortuyn represented, not the man. He did not find it easy to talk about feelings. Asked about the danger of accidentally injuring somebody other than Fortuyn in the attack, he said that he had been confident that that wouldn't happen. The 3FM disc jockey Ruud de Wild said that he barely escaped with his life, as he received a bullet in the bag used for a shield.\n\nTo the argument that Fortuyn would have been chosen through democratic means, Van der Graaf said that that was also the case for Hitler. He compared the rise of Fortuyn to the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. In his final argument, he said that he had acted from his conscience, but that did not justify murder. He said it was absolutely not normal to shoot somebody to death.\n\nVan der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to defend Dutch Muslims from persecution. He wanted to stop Fortuyn from targeting \"the weak parts of society to score points\" and exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" in an attempt to seek political power.\n\nVan der Graaf said that he would not have committed the murder, at least not on that evening, if Fortuyn had been accompanied by security guards. This is relevant for accusations that the government should have provided security. On Tuesday, 15 April 2003, Van der Graaf was convicted and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment.\n\nThe prosecution and the defence both made appeals against the sentence. Prior to the appeal, suggestions in the media that Van der Graaf may have had Asperger syndrome were rejected by workers at the PBC. They said they had considered and rejected the possibility. A psychiatric report read in court said that Van der Graaf had an obsessive compulsive personality but was sane and could be held accountable for his actions. The prosecution argued that the court had not taken account of the political nature of the murder, and asked again for life imprisonment. The defence argued that the sentence didn't take account of the harsh conditions under which Van der Graaf had been held, nor the damage that had been done by unsubstantiated allegations that had appeared in the media (such as the connection with Van der Werken), and requested a reduction in sentence to 16 years. The appeals court accepted some of the arguments from both parties, and on 18 July 2003 reiterated the sentence to 18 years' imprisonment.\n\nVan der Graaf was released on parole on 2 May 2014, after having served two thirds of his sentence as required by Dutch law. The conditions of his parole were: weekly reporting to the probation service; a ban on visiting the places of residence of relatives of the victim or the municipal areas of Rotterdam, Hilversum and The Hague; location monitoring with an ankle bracelet with GPS; a ban on contacting the relatives of Fortuyn; a ban on communicating with the media; and compulsory meetings with a psychologist or psychiatrist. He subsequently settled in Apeldoorn.\n\nIn July 2014, his lawyer Stijn Franken started legal proceedings against the terms of the parole. Van der Graaf was interested in becoming a legal advisor, and the restriction on visiting The Hague was unreasonable when so many legal organisations are based there. He also claimed that the restriction on communicating with the press was a violation of free speech, and that this and other restrictions were unnecessary when experts had found the risk of recidivism to be extremely low. He was partially successful, in that the travel restrictions and the ankle bracelet conditions were removed, but the media ban remained to \"prevent unnecessary social unrest\". The government appealed the judgement, but it was upheld.\n\nIn 2017, Van der Graaf faced another court case in which the public prosecutor asked that he be returned to prison for a year for failing to sufficiently answer questions at probation meetings. However, on 6 February 2017 the court found that he had sufficiently met his probation requirements by appearing at the meetings.\n\nIn 2018, Van der Graaf again took legal action against the government over the terms of his parole, saying that the parol hearings prevented him from emigrating. The court ruled in his favour, and an appeal was withdrawn after a new arrangement was made: that Van der Graaf would report by email once every two months, until April 2020.\n\n"}

{"id": "39751570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39751570", "title": "Women in Finland", "text": "Women in Finland\n\nWomen in Finland enjoy a \"high degree of equality\" and \"traditional courtesy\" among men. In 1906, the women of Finland became the first women in Europe to be granted the right to vote. There are many women in Finland who hold prominent positions in Finnish society, in the academics, in the field of business, and in the government of Finland. An example of powerful women in Finnish politics is Tarja Halonen, who became the first female president of the country (she was Foreign Minister of Finland before becoming president). In religion, where most of the Finnish people are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (the other major Christian denomination in Finland is the Orthodox Church), women can be ordained as priests. In terms of finance, Finnish women have been described as \"usually independent financially\". Married women, by custom, introduces themselves by mentioning their forename first, then their maiden name, and then the surname of their husbands. \"The Telegraph\" has written: \n\nIn using the sauna, women bathe separately from men, except if they are with family members or friends.\nFinland is bordered on the east by Russia, on the south by the Gulf of Finland and Estonia, and on the west by the Gulf of Bothnia and Sweden, and on the north/north west by Norway. ¼ of the territory is north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nTotal Population: 5,364,546\n\nMen Population: 2,632,309\n\nWomen Population: 2,732,237\n\nYears for Total Population: 79.69\n\nMale: 76.24 years\n\nFemale: 83.29 years\n\nThe area that in 1809 became Finland was a group of integral provinces of the Kingdom of Sweden for over 600 years, signifying that also women in Finland were allowed to vote during the Swedish Age of Liberty (1718–1772), when suffrage was granted to tax-paying female members of guilds\n\nThe predecessor state of modern Finland, the Grand Duchy of Finland was part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917 and enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. In 1863 taxpaying women were granted municipal suffrage in the countryside, and in 1872, the same reform was given to the cities\n\nThe Parliament Act in 1906 established the unicameral parliament of Finland and both women and men were given the right to vote and stand for election. Thus Finnish women became the first in the world to have unrestricted rights both to vote and to stand for parliament. In elections the next year, 19 female MPs, first ones in the world, were elected and women have continued to play a central role in the nation's politics ever since. Miina Sillanpää, a key figure in the worker's movement, became the first female minister in 1926.\n\nFinland's first female President Tarja Halonen was voted into office in 2000 and for a second term in 2006. Since the 2011 parliamentary election, women's representation stands at 42,5%. In 2003 Anneli Jäätteenmäki became the first female Prime Minister of Finland, and in 2007 Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet made history as for the first time there were more women than men in the cabinet of Finland (12 vs. 8).\n\nIn 1970 there was a brief but strong women's movement. Rape in marriage was not considered a crime at the time, and victims of domestic violence had nowhere to go when things got really ugly. They also fought for a day-care system that would be open to the public, and for the right for not only paid maternity leave but also paternity leave. Today there is a 263-day parental leave in Finland. and making it illegal to discriminate against women in the workforce. Two feminist groups were created to help the movement: \"The Marxist-Feminists\" and \"the Red Women\". The feminists in Finland were inspired by other European countries such as Sweden and Switzerland. Other important groups for the Finnish women in the 1970s include \"Unioni\" and \"The Feminists\"\n\nFinland became one of the first countries to grant women the right to vote, and still today they are among the top countries for women equality. \"Finland was voted second in the Global Gender Gap Index in women’s rights.\" In 2003 the government of Finland proposed addressing issues with gender inequality. They planned to promote gender equality over the entire public administration, reform the Act on Equality that the men and women in Finland share, promote equal pay for work of equal value, increase the number of women in political and economic roles, assessing gender equality from the male point of view, prevent domestic violence and intimate partner violence, protect victims of trafficking and the possibility of criminalizing buying sex. This act is called the Government Action Plan for Gender Equality and it included more than 100 issues that needed discussion.\n\nIn the late 18th century and early 19th century private schools for girls were established in Finland, among the more known being those of Christina Krook, Anna Salmberg and Sara Wacklin. These schools were criticized for its shallow education of accomplishments, which resulted in the decision that girls should be included in the school reform of 1843, and the following year, two Swedish-language state schools for girls was founded in Turku and Helsinki, \"Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Åbo\" and \"Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors\". This led to the establishment of a net of girl schools of a similar kind in Finland. At first the schools were reserved for girls from upper-class families. \nAt this time it was not possible for the girls to pass the baccalaureate and move on to university studies. In 1865 a grammar school made it clear that only girls whose upbringing and manners were impeccable and whose company can’t be considered detrimental to others, and who were from \"respectable\" families could be in the school.\n\nAfter the first woman in Finland, Maria Tschetschulin, was accepted as a university student by dispensation in 1870, advanced classes and colleges classes were included in many girl schools to prepare students for university (by means of dispensation), and in 1872, the demand that all students must be members of the Swedish language upper classes was dropped. Women were given the right to teach in grammar schools for girls in 1882.\n\nWhen the dispensation for female university students was dropped and women were accepted at the same terms as men in 1915, girls and boys started to receive the same education in the school system, and the girl schools in Finland started to be changed to same sex education, a development which was completed in the 1970s.\n\nFinland students start their schooling a year after a lot of other countries. In spite of this, Finland is now one of the top-performing countries in mathematical skills, but also one of the few whose boys performed as well as girls. While in most countries the most able girls lag behind the most able boys in mathematics performance, according to the PISA 2012 Results Overview, the OECD gender score difference in mathematics, reading, and science was a result of -6 (boys - girls) in Finland. Additionally, while the highest-performing students of problem solving in the world are largely males, Finland makes an exception where the proportion of top-performing females is about the same as the proportion of top-performing males. This is also true among the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) where the top-performers in problem solving are predominantly men, except for in Finland, Australia and Canada.\n\nAs for Finland's educational benefits for students, Finnish schools offer state-funded schooling which makes it easier for women and men to go to work after being on parental leave. Women represent 32% of students studying in mathematics and computer science.\n\nAccording to the Finnish Labor Force Survey around 32% of the 301,000 people who are self-employed are women. Women first became involved in labor markets through agrarian societies. Even before the public daycare systems, the number of women in the workforce was still very high, over 50%. The number of workers in the labor force that makes up the females (ages 15–74) is 51%, where men is 49%. 32% of the women are involved in entrepreneurship.\n\nEmployers who have at least 30 employees must have a gender equality plan that includes a women's and men's pay comparison. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and other important labor market organizations set guidelines for gender equality planning.\n\nMilitary service is required for men in Finland, but is voluntary for women. Women who enlist are allowed to train for combat roles. Finland is one of 16 other countries in the world that permit women in front-line combat positions.\n\n\n"}
