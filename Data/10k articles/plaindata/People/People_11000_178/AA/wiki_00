Prior to living in Salem Village (now Danvers, Massachusetts), she and her family had lived in Casco, Maine, the frontier of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, during a time when there were many attacks by the Wabanaki Native Americans. Her father William and stepmother, Deliverance Hobbs, were also both charged with witchcraft.\n\nDuring her multiple examinations by local magistrates between April and June 1692, Abigail confessed and accused others of witchcraft, including John Proctor. At her trial in September, she pleaded guilty to both indictments against her, one for afflicting Mercy Lewis and another for covenanting with the Devil. In her examination on April 20, 1692, Abigail Hobbs accused George Burroughs, the previous minister of Salem, of being a witch. With the naming of Minister Burroughs, a well-respected member of the community, many accusations came forth and climbed up the social hierarchy.\n\nGovernor William Phips granted the Hobbs family a reprieve in January 1693, after Chief Magistrate William Stoughton had signed the warrant for her execution. In 1710, her father, William Hobbs, petitioned the General Court to compensate him for £40 expenses that the family's imprisonment cost him but said he was willing to accept £10, which the court granted him in 1712.

{"id": "983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=983", "title": "Albert Camus", "text": "Albert Camus\n\nAlbert Camus (; ; 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French philosopher, author, and journalist. His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He wrote in his essay \"The Rebel\" that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44 in 1957, the second youngest recipient in history.\n\nCamus did not consider himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as a follower of it, even in his lifetime. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations: \"No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked.\"\n\nCamus was born in French Algeria to a \"Pied-Noir\" family and studied at the University of Algiers, from which he graduated in 1936. In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons to \"denounce two ideologies found in both the USSR and the USA\".\n\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in Mondovi (present-day Dréan), in French Algeria. His mother was Minorcan descent and could only hear out of her left ear. His father, Lucien, a poor agricultural worker of Alsatian descent, was wounded in the Battle of the Marne in 1914 during World War I, while serving as a member of a Zouave infantry regiment. Lucien died from his wounds in a makeshift army hospital on 11 October. Camus and his mother, an illiterate house cleaner, lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of Algiers.\n\nIn 1923, Camus gained acceptance into the and eventually was admitted to the University of Algiers. After contracting tuberculosis in 1930, he had to end his football activities: he had been a goalkeeper for a prominent Algerian university team. In addition, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute. He completed his \"licence de philosophie\" (BA) in 1936; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on Plotinus, \"Rapports de l'hellénisme et du christianisme à travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\"), for his \"\" (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis).\n\nCamus joined the French Communist Party in early 1935, seeing it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria.\" He did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read \"Das Kapital\", but did write, \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" In 1936, the independence-minded Algerian Communist Party (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of the Algerian People's Party (\"Le Parti du Peuple Algérien\"), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades, who in 1937 denounced him as a Trotskyite and expelled him from the party. Camus then became associated with the French anarchist movement.\n\nThe anarchist André Prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the \"Cercle des Étudiants Anarchistes\" (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as \"Le Libertaire\", \"La révolution Prolétarienne\", and \"Solidaridad Obrera\" (Workers' Solidarity), the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT (National Confederation of Labor). Camus stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the uprising of 1953 in East Germany. He again allied with the anarchists in 1956, first in support of the workers' uprising in Poznań, Poland, and then later in the year with the Hungarian Revolution.\n\nCamus was irreligious. “I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist.” ~\"Notebooks 1951–1959\". He told \"Le Monde\" in 1956, \"I would agree with Benjamin Constant, who thought a lack of religion was vulgar and even hackneyed.\"\n\nIn 1934, Camus married Simone Hié, but the marriage ended as a consequence of infidelities on both sides. In 1935, he founded \"Théâtre du Travail\" (Worker's Theatre), renamed \"Théâtre de l'Equipe\" (Theatre of the Team) in 1937. It lasted until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper, \"Alger-Républicain\". His work included a report on the poor conditions for peasants in Kabylie, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, \"Soir-Republicain\". He was rejected by the French army because of his tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1940, Camus married Francine Faure, a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved her, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after Francine gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, on 5 September 1945, he continued to joke to friends that he was not cut out for marriage. Camus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress María Casares, with whom he had an extensive correspondence. In the same year, Camus began to work for \"Paris-Soir\" magazine. In the first stage of World War II, during the so-called Phoney War, Camus was a pacifist. While in Lyon during the Wehrmacht occupation, on 15 December 1941, Camus read about the Paris execution of Gabriel Péri; it crystallized his revolt against the Germans. He moved to Bordeaux with the rest of the staff of \"Paris-Soir\". In the same year he finished \"The Stranger\", his first novel, and \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". He returned briefly to Oran, Algeria, in 1942.\n\nCamus was once asked by his friend Charles Poncet which he preferred, football or the theatre. Camus is said to have replied, \"Football, without hesitation.\"\n\nCamus played as goalkeeper for Racing Universitaire d'Alger (RUA won both the North African Champions Cup and the North African Cup twice each in the 1930s) junior team from 1928 to 1930. The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously. In match reports Camus would often attract positive comment for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17. The affliction, which was then incurable, caused Camus to be bedridden for long and painful periods.\n\nWhen Camus was asked in the 1950s by an alumnus sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, his response included the following: \"After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RUA.\" Camus was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays, the principle of sticking up for your friends, of valuing bravery and fair-play. Camus's belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over-complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are, potentially to serve their own needs.\n\nA professional footballer appears as a character in \"The Plague\" and football is discussed in the dialogue.\n\nAs he wrote in \"L'Homme révolté\" (\"The Rebel\"), in the chapter about \"The Thought on Midday\", Camus was a follower of the ancient Greek 'Solar Tradition' (la \"pensée solaire\"). In 1947–48, he founded the Revolutionary Union Movement (\"Groupes de liaison internationale\" – GLI) a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (\"Syndicalisme révolutionnaire\"). According to Olivier Todd, in his biography \"Albert Camus, une vie\", it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the Surrealist movement of André Breton. For more, see the book \"Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement révolutionnaire international\" by Christian Gras.\n\nHis colleagues were Nicolas Lazarévitch, Louis Mercier, Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, Jean de Boë (see the article: \"Nicolas Lazarévitch, Itinéraire d'un syndicaliste révolutionnaire\" by Sylvain Boulouque in the review \"Communisme\", n° 61, 2000). His main aim was to express the positive side of surrealism and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of André Breton.\n\nFrom 1943, Albert Camus had correspondence with Altiero Spinelli who founded the European Federalist Movement in Milan—see Ventotene Manifesto and the book \"Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati\", Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus.\n\nIn 1944, Camus founded the \"French Committee for the European Federation\" (\"Comité Français pour la Féderation Européenne\" – CFFE) declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"\n\nFrom 22 to 25 March 1945, the first conference of the European Federalist Movement was organised in Paris with the participation of Albert Camus, George Orwell, Emmanuel Mounier, Lewis Mumford, André Philip, Daniel Mayer, François Bondy and Altiero Spinelli. This specific branch of the European Federalist Movement disintegrated in 1957 after Winston Churchill's ideas about European integration rose to dominance.\n\nCamus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46, in a car accident near Sens, in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of Villeblevin. In his coat pocket was an unused train ticket. He had planned to travel by train with his wife and children, but at the last minute he accepted his publisher's proposal to travel with him.\n\nThe driver of the Facel Vega HK500 car, , who was Camus' publisher and close friend, died five days after the accident. In August 2011, the Milan newspaper \"Corriere della Sera\" reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus' biographer, , did not consider it credible. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France.\n\nHe was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the age of 42.\n\nHe was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work.\n\nTwo of Camus' works were published posthumously. The first, entitled \"A Happy Death\" (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to \"The Stranger\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, \"The First Man\" (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria.\n\nThe first publication of Camus (co-written by Jeanne-Paule Sicard, Yves Bourgeois and Alfred Poignant, and edited by Edmond Charlot) was Revolte dans les Asturies in May 1936. This concerned a revolt by Spanish miners brutally suppressed by the Spanish government. In May 1937 he wrote his first book \"L’Envers et l’Endroit\" – dedicated to Jean Grenier and edited by Charlot.\nDuring the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell \"Combat\", which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the \"nom de guerre\" \"Beauchard\". Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, \"The Flies\", in June 1943.\n\nWhen the Allies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bombs on Japan. He resigned from \"Combat\" in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Café de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre.\n\nIn 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published \"The Rebel\", a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays.\n\nCamus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" and incorporated into many of his other works, such as \"The Stranger\" and \"The Plague\". Despite his split from his \"study partner\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \"Enigma\" and elsewhere. The current confusion arises, in part, because many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of Camus's \"practical\" ideas (see: \"Resistance, Rebellion, and Death\"). But, his personal understanding of the world (e.g., \"a benign indifference\", in \"The Stranger\"), and every vision he had for its progress (e.g., vanquishing the \"adolescent furies\" of history and society, in \"The Rebel\") undoubtedly set him apart.\n\nIn the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to human rights. In 1952, he resigned from his work for UNESCO when the UN accepted Spain as a member under the leadership of General Franco. In 1953, he criticized Soviet methods to crush a workers' strike in East Berlin. In 1956, he protested against similar methods in Poland (protests in Poznań) and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October.\nCamus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with Arthur Koestler, the writer, intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment. He was consistent in his call for non-aggression in Algeria (see below).\n\nFrom 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for \"L'Express\". In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\".\n\nCamus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations. Camus put the painter and set decorator Mayo, who had already illustrated several of Camus' novels (\"The Stranger\", 1948 edition), in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets.\n\nCamus once confided that the troubles in Algeria \"affected him as others feel pain in their lungs.\"\n\nIn the 1930s, Camus was affiliated with Left-wing groups like the \"Maison de Culture\" in Algiers which were highly critical of the French colonial regime's treatment of Algeria's Arab and indigenous inhabitants, supporting the Blum-Viollette proposal to grant Algerians full French citizenship. His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus' most systematic statement on his views at this time. In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for \"Alger Republicain\" on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the Kabylie highlands, advocating for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.\n\nIn 1945, following the Sétif and Guelma massacre after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony, again writing a series of article reports on conditions, and advocating for French concessions and reforms to the demands of the Algerian people.\n\nWhen the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the \"Pieds-Noirs\" such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favoring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the \"Pieds-Noirs\" and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.\n\nWhen he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. At the time of his death, Camus was working on an incomplete novel with a strong biographical component titled \"The First Man.\" The publication of this book in 1994 has sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus' allegedly unrepentant colonialism in the work of figures such as David Carroll in the English-speaking world.\n\nAs one of the forefathers of existentialism, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life and its inevitable ending (death) is highlighted in the very famous opening of the novel \"The Stranger\" (1942): \"Today mother died. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure.\" This alludes to his claim that life is engrossed by the absurd. He believed that the absurd – life being void of meaning, or man's inability to know that meaning if it were to exist – was something that man should embrace. He argued that this crisis of self could cause a man to commit \"philosophical suicide\"; choosing to believe in external sources that give life false meaning. He argued that religion was the main culprit. If a man chose to believe in religion – that the meaning of life was to ascend to heaven, or some similar afterlife, that he committed philosophical suicide by trying to escape the absurd.\n\nMany writers have addressed the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd is and what comprises its importance. For example, Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while Kierkegaard explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally. Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe\" (\"The Myth of Sisyphus\"). To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus' Absurd\".\n\nHis early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, \"L'Envers et l'endroit\" (\"Betwixt and Between)\" in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, \"Noces\" (\"Nuptials\"), in 1938. In these essays Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life as \"L'Étranger\" (\"The Stranger\"). In the same year he released \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe\" (\"The Myth of Sisyphus\"), a literary essay on the Absurd. He also wrote a play about Caligula, a Roman Emperor, pursuing an absurd logic. The play was not performed until 1945.\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the \"Revue Libre\" in 1943, the second in the \"Cahiers de Libération\" in 1944, and the third in the newspaper \"Libertés\", in 1945. The four letters were published as \"Lettres à un ami allemand\" (\"Letters to a German Friend\") in 1945, and were included in the collection \"Resistance, Rebellion, and Death\".\n\nCamus presents the reader with dualisms such as happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. He emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality; for Camus, this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In \"Le Mythe\", dualism becomes a paradox: we value our own lives in spite of our mortality and in spite of the universe's silence. While we can live with a dualism (\"I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come\"), we cannot live with the paradox (\"I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless\"). In \"Le Mythe\", Camus investigates our experience of the Absurd and asks how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?\n\nIn \"Le Mythe\", Camus suggests that 'creation of meaning' would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort. But Camus wants to know if he can live with what logic and lucidity have uncovered – if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more. Creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem. He gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap. The alternative option, namely suicide, would entail another kind of leap, where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms (the human being). Camus points out, however, that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life, and that it simply evades the problem yet again. Camus concludes that we must instead \"entertain\" both death and the absurd, while never agreeing to their terms.\n\nMeursault, the absurdist hero of \"L'Étranger,\" has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed. Caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, while Camus possibly suggests that Caligula's absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts Meursault's final moments.\n\nCamus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected nihilism as a valid response. If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning. — \"Second Letter to a German Friend\", December 1943.\n\nCamus's understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus, though they are most likely sources of \"relative\" versus \"absolute\" meaning. In \"The Rebel,\" Camus identifies rebellion (or rather, the values indicated by rebellion) as a basis for human solidarity. When he rebels, a man identifies himself with other men and so surpasses himself, and from this point of view human solidarity is metaphysical. But for the moment we are only talking of the kind of solidarity that is born in chains. \n\nDespite his opposition to the label, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of suicide. He wrote, \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide. Deciding whether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy. All other questions follow from that.\" Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life. In \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", Camus seeks to identify the kinds of life that could be worth living despite their inherent meaninglessness.\n\nThroughout his life, Camus spoke out against and actively opposed totalitarianism in its many forms. Early on, Camus was active within the French Resistance to the German occupation of France during World War II, even directing the famous Resistance journal \"Combat\". On the French collaboration with Nazi occupiers he wrote: \"Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.\" After liberation, Camus remarked, \"This country does not need a Talleyrand, but a Saint-Just.\" The reality of the bloody postwar tribunals soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of capital punishment.\n\nCamus's well-known falling out with Sartre is linked to his opposition to authoritarian communism. Camus detected a reflexive totalitarianism in the mass politics espoused by Sartre in the name of Marxism. This was apparent in his work \"L'Homme Révolté\" (\"The Rebel\") which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics and ideas. Camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the Soviet Union, a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech \"The Blood of the Hungarians\", commemorating the anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army.\n\nOne further important, often neglected component of Camus' philosophical and literary persona was his love of classical Greek thought and literature, or philhellenism. This love looks back to his youthful encounters with Friedrich Nietzsche, his teacher Jean Grenier, and his own sense of a \"Mediterranean\" identity, based in a common experience of sunshine, beaches, and living in proximity to the near-Eastern world. Camus' \"Diplomes\" thesis (roughly like an MA thesis in most anglophone countries) was on the transition between classical Greek and Roman, and Christian culture, featuring chapters on the early Church, gnosticism, Plotinus and Saint Augustine's \"second revelation\", bringing Greek philosophical conceptuality to Christian revelation. Camus' early essay collection \"Noces (Nuptials)\" features essays set amidst classical Roman ruins; as the \"Myth of Sisyphus\" and \"The Rebel\" (which takes as its hero Prometheus) both are rooted in Camus' classical paideia. The culmination of the latter work defends a \"midday thought\" based in classical moderation or \"mesure\", in opposition to the tendency of modern political ideologies to exclusively valorise race or class, and to dream of a total redemptive revolution. Camus' conception of classical moderation also has deep roots in his lifelong love of Greek tragic theatre, about which he gave an intriguing address in Athens in 1956. He appealed to Queen Elizabeth II for mercy for the young Greek anti-colonial freedom fighter Michalis Karaolis, from Kypros (Chypre, Zypern), who was sentenced to death in 1956. Camus's letter was acquired at auction by Nasos Ktorides and donated to the National Struggle Museum in Nicosia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She married Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, who later became the Prince Regent of Bavaria after her death.\n\nAuguste was one of three children born to Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, by his first wife, Maria Anna of Saxony. She was an older half-sister to Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany, among others. She was a member of the direct lineage of both Louis XIV of France and William the Conqueror.\n\nAfter a strict Catholic upbringing, she developed an interest in the arts and sciences early in life.

{"id": "24081774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24081774", "title": "Arias Pérez", "text": "Arias Pérez\n\nArias Pérez or Peres (\"fl.\" 1110–1129) was a Galician knight and military leader in the Kingdom of León. According to modern scholar Richard Fletcher, he was \"active, resourceful, spirited and persuasive\", and the contemporary \"Historia compostellana\" says that he was \"so eloquent that he could turn black into white and white into black\", although he \"was not of the great nobility\" (\"non fuit tamen magnae nobilitatis\"). \n\nArias's father, Pedro Arias, was described as a \"knight of Deza\" (\"miles de Deza\") in a document of 1115. Arias first met Diego Gelmírez, future Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, in childhood. Diego's father Gelmirio was also a Galician knight. At some point Pedro granted an estate, a portion of a certain \"Villa nova\", probably Vilanova de Arousa in Deza, to the church of nearby Compostela. His brother Luzo (Lucius) Arias made a similar donation. On 11 January 1096 Pedro and his brother subscribed a charter whereby Raymond of Galicia gave the village of \"Pastoriza\" in the parish of \"Brandariz\" in Deza to the monastery of Carboeiro (or Deza); they also signed side by side a document of 24 October 1102. Arias's origins among the lesser nobility is further confirmed by the description of his uncle in the \"Historia compostellan\" as of the \"milites\" (knights) and not the \"consules et comites\" (\"consuls and counts\", synonymous titles). Arias had a cousin named Leovigildo Luz, mentioned in the \"Historia\", who was the son of his uncle. Arias's paternal grandfather, after whom he was named, was most likely the Arias Luzu who undersigned certain royal documents between 1066 and 1075, including a grant to Carboeiro. In 1062 he witnessed and possibly conducted the survey of an estate at \"Pastoriza\" later included in Raymond's 1096 grant to Carboeiro. Between 1095 and 1101 he became \"villicus terrae\" of Deza. His wife, Mayor, held land in the Salnés, as did Arias Pérez, who tried several times to acquire more.\n\nIn 1107 Pedro Fróilaz de Traba, the guardian of the heir, Alfonso Raimúndez, rebelled against Queen Urraca and her new husband, Alfonso the Battler. According to the \"Historia\", he was opposed by a \"brotherhood\" (\"germanitas\") led by Arias Pérez (from 1110). It is possible that Pedro's rebellion represented a \"Galician separatism\" and Arias's brotherhood a \"Leonese loyalism\", but it is more probable that Pedro simply had the support of northwestern Galicia and Arias of the south. Arias got Diego Gelmírez, the most powerful churchman in Galicia, to accept the leadership of the brotherhood late in 1109 or early in 1110. In 1110 a truce between Pedro and the brotherhood was broken when the former took over the south Galician fortress of Castrelo de Miño and installed a garrison there under his wife Urraca and the young Alfonso. Arias promptly besieged it, and Pedro came to defend it. The besieged called on Diego to negotiate terms of surrender, which he did, but the brotherhood had grown suspicious of him and when a deal was struck Arias had Diego, Pedro, and Alfonso all arrested. In exchange for the castles of Oeste and , they were all soon released and Diego went over to the separatists. After the coronation of Alfonso and reconciliation of the Galicians with the queen in 1111, Arias was besieged in Lobeira with the aid of royal forces, and there he was captured in April 1112.\n\nLate in 1113, when the royal court was in Galicia, Arias was inciting Urraca against Diego. She tried to confiscate the property of the three Bodán brothers from Deza, including the monastery of or in Arias's area of interest. In 1120, according to the \"Historia\", Urraca ordered the leading men (\"principes\") of Galicia, including Arias Pérez, Fernando Yáñez, Bermudo Suárez, Juan Díaz, and others, to do homage (\"hominium\") to Diego Gelmírez as \"their lord, their patron, their king and their prince, saving their fealty to the queen\" and recognise his rule (\"dominio\"). In 1121, however, after Diego had renewed his alliance with the Pedro Fróilaz de Traba, his power appeared to threaten that of the queen. In the summer of 1121 she had him arrested at Castrelo by Arias in collaboration with Fernando Yáñez and the former \"merino\" Juan Ramírez. Diego was imprisoned in Juan Díaz's castle at Orcellón. Around this time (1121/2) Arias patched up his feud with Pedro by marrying the latter's daughter Ildaria (Ilduara). \n\nIn the spring of 1126, shortly after Urraca's death and the accession of Alfonso, Arias led a rebellion in Galicia. Diego Gelmírez and Gómez Núñez of Toroño or perhaps Gutierre Vermúdez were charged \"per litteras\" (\"by letter\") with putting it down. Diego besieged Arias in Lobeiro and, with siege engines, in Tabeirós, forcing him to surrender. Shortly after 6 January 1129, at the funeral of Arias's mother-in-law, Mayor Rodríguez de Bárcena, Diego persuaded Arias to give up his half of the church/monastery at in the Salnés. Diego's opinion of Arias was such that he said to him: \"I fear, therefore, that if such that you are you leave this world, you will lose eternal life and incur the perpetual condemnation of your soul.\"\n"}

{"id": "384160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=384160", "title": "Beaver Wars", "text": "Beaver Wars\n\nThe Beaver Wars, also known as the Iroquois Wars or the French and Iroquois Wars, encompass a series of conflicts fought intermittently during the 17th and 18th centuries in eastern North America.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Beaver Wars were battles for economic welfare throughout the St. Lawrence River valley and the lower Great Lakes region. The wars were between the Iroquois trying to take control of the fur trade from the Hurons, the northern Algonquians, and their French allies. From medieval times, Europeans had obtained furs from Russia and Scandinavia. American pelts began coming on the market during the 16th century—decades before the French, English, and Dutch established permanent settlements and trading posts on the continent—after Basque fishermen chasing cod off Newfoundland's Grand Banks bartered with local Indians for beaver robes to help fend off the numbing Atlantic chill. By virtue of their location, military might, and diplomatic skill, these tribes wielded tremendous influence in European-Indian relations from the early seventeenth century through the late 18th century.\n\nThe Iroquois sought to expand their territory and monopolize the fur trade and the trade between European markets and the tribes of the western Great Lakes region. They were an aboriginal confederation of five nations—Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca. (The confederation later became the \"Six Nations\" when the Tuscarora were adopted in the 18th century.) Each of these Native American nations has beliefs in tribal sovereignty and a collective body called a league. Government officials in the later American capital in Washington, D.C. and Canadian capital of Ottawa recognized the Iroquois sovereignty only in existence of individual tribal governments. The Iroquois Confederation, led by the dominant Mohawk, mobilized against the largely Algonquian-speaking tribes of the Great Lakes region. The Iroquois were armed by their Dutch and English trading partners; the Algonquian were backed by the French, their chief trading partner.\n\nThe wars were brutal and are considered one of the bloodiest series of conflicts in the history of North America. As the Iroquois destroyed several large tribal confederacies—including the Huron, Neutral, Erie, Susquehannock, and Shawnee, they became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory, realigning the tribal geography of North America. They pushed some eastern tribes to the west of the Mississippi River, or southward into the Carolinas. The Iroquois gained control of the Ohio River valley lands as hunting ground, from about 1670 onward. The Ohio Country and the Lower Peninsula of Michigan had become virtually empty of Native people as refugees fled westward to escape the Iroquois warriors. (Much of this region was later repopulated by Native peoples nominally subjected to the Six Nations; see Mingo.)\n\nBoth Algonquian and Iroquoian societies were greatly disrupted by these wars. The conflict subsided with the loss by the Iroquois of their Dutch allies in the New Netherland (later lower New York State) colony after England took it over in 1664, with Fort Amsterdam and the town of New Amsterdam, renaming it New York, and with French objective of gaining the Iroquois as an ally against English encroachment. After the Iroquois became trading partners with the English, their alliance was a crucial component of the later English western and northern expansion leading to the French and Indian War (1754-1763). The English/British also used the Iroquois conquests as a claim to the later old Northwest Territory, of the United States, northwest of the Ohio River and around the Great Lakes.\n\nThe expeditions of French explorer Jacques Cartier in the 1540s made the first written records of the Native Americans in North America. French explorers and fishermen had traded in the region near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River estuary a decade before then for valuable furs. Cartier wrote of encounters with a people later classified as the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, also known as the \"Stadaconan\" or \"Laurentian\" people, who occupied several fortified villages, including \"Stadacona\" and \"Hochelaga\". Cartier recorded an ongoing war between the Stadaconans and another tribe known as the \"Toudaman\", who had destroyed one of their forts the previous year, resulting in 200 deaths.\n\nWars and politics in Europe distracted French efforts at colonization in the St. Lawrence Valley until the beginning of the 17th century, when they founded Quebec in 1608. When the French returned to the area, they found the sites of both Stadacona and Hochelaga abandoned, completely destroyed by an unknown enemy.\n\nBased on analysis of political and economic conditions at the time, some anthropologists and historians have suggested that the Mohawk Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy destroyed and drove out the St. Lawrence Iroquoians. When the French returned, they found no inhabitants in this part of the upper river valley. The Iroquois and the Iroquoian-speaking Huron used it as hunting ground. The causes remain unclear. (Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the \"Jesuit Relations\", speaks of a draining war between the Mohawk and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois (The \"American Heritage Book of Indians\" puts this as taking place about 1570).\n\nWhen the French returned in 1601, the St. Lawrence Valley had already been the site of generations of blood feud-style warfare, as characterized the relations of the Iroquois with virtually all neighboring peoples. In 1603, when Samuel de Champlain visited \"Tadoussac\" near the St. Lawrence, the \"Montagnais\", Algonquin, and Huron almost immediately recruited him and his small company of French adventurers to assist in attacking their Iroquois enemies upriver.\n\nBefore 1603, Champlain had formed an offensive alliance against the Iroquois. He decided that the French would not trade firearms to the Iroquois. He had a commercial rationale: the northern Natives provided the French with valuable furs and the Iroquois, based in present-day New York, interfered with that trade. The first deliberate battle with the Iroquois in 1609 was fought at Champlain's initiative. Narrative makes it plain Champlain deliberately went along with a war party down Lake Champlain, and further, this battle created 150 years of mistrust that poisoned any chances that French-Iroquois alliances would be durable and long lived. Champlain wrote, \"I had come with no other intention than to make war\". In the company of his Huron and Algonkin allies, Champlain and his forces fought a pitched battle with the Mohawk on the shores of Lake Champlain. Champlain singlehandedly killed three chiefs with an \"arquebus\" despite the war chiefs having worn \"arrowproof body armor made of plaited sticks\".\n\nIn 1610, Champlain and his armed French companions helped the Algonquin and the Huron defeat a large Iroquois raiding party. In 1615, Champlain joined a Huron raiding party and took part in a siege on an Iroquois town, probably among the Onondaga south of Lake Ontario (in present-day New York State). The attack ultimately failed, and Champlain was injured. After Hudson River's discovery for the Dutch East India Company in 1609, a year-round trading post was placed near Albany. At Fort Nassau the Dutch were surrounded by 1600 warriors and families of the Mahican tribe (Algonquian). The Dutch offered to buy the land off of the Mahicans but allowed traders to live among them as valued guests and in 1618 they had an agreement with the traders around. In the earlier 17th century, the great potential was yet to be discovered west towards the Great Lakes. 1617 Fort Nassau was abandoned due to flooding and in 1624 Fort Orange was built. Fort Orange renewed efforts to exploit traffic along the Mahicans Channel, and thus started war with the Mohawks. In 1626 the Dutch and the Mahicans were ambushed by Mohawks who were only armed with bows and arrows. The Dutch withdrew from the treaty with the Mahicans and made a truce with the Mohawks. The Mohawks wanted to avoid further conflict with Fort Orange. They wanted to prosper rather than destroy it. By 1628 the Mohawks defeated the Mahicans, who eventually fled to the Connecticut Valley. The Mohawks did not intend to defeat the Mahicans to open free trade; rather, they wanted to destroy Dutch trade.\n\nIn 1610-1614, the Dutch established a series of seasonal trading posts on the Hudson and Delaware rivers, including one on Castle Island at the eastern edge of Mohawk territory near present-day Albany. This gave the Iroquois direct access (through the Mohawk) to European markets. The Dutch trading efforts and eventual colonies in New Jersey and Delaware soon also established trade with the coastal Delaware nation (Lenape) and more southerly Susquehannock. The Dutch were reluctant to trade firearms to the Delaware. Their founding in 1614 of Fort Nassau and its 1624 replacement by Fort Orange (both at Albany) removed the Iroquois' need to rely on the French and their allied tribes or to have to travel through southern tribal territories to reach European traders. The Dutch supplied the Mohawk and other Iroquois with guns. In addition, the new post offered valuable tools that the Iroquois could receive in exchange for animal pelts. They began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products.\n\nAt this time, conflict began to grow quickly between the Iroquois and the Indigenous people supported by the French. The Iroquois inhabited the region of present-day New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River. The Iroquois lands comprised a large ethnic island, surrounded on all sides but the south by Algonquian-speaking nations, all traditional enemies—including the Shawnee to the west in the Ohio Country. Their rivals also included the Iroquoian-speaking Neutral Nation and Huron confederacies, who lived on the western shore of Lake Ontario and southern shore of Lake Huron to the west, respectively, and the Susquehannock to their south. While part of the Iroquoian-speaking language family, these tribes historically were competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who at that time had Five Nations in their confederacy.\n\nIn 1628 the Mohawk defeated the Mahican, pushing them east of the Hudson River and establishing a monopoly of trade with the Dutch at Fort Orange (later Albany, New York), New Netherland. In the same era, the Susquehannock, also well armed by Dutch traders, effectively reduced the strength of the Delaware and won a protracted declared war with the English-dominated Province of Maryland. By the 1630s, the Iroquois had become fully armed with European weaponry through their trade with the Dutch.\n\nThe Iroquois (particularly the Mohawk), had come to rely on the trade for firearms and other highly valued and much coveted European goods for their livelihood and survival. They used their growing expertise with the arquebus to good effect in their continuing wars with the Algonquin, Huron, and other traditional enemies. The French, meanwhile, outlawed the trading of firearms to their native allies, though they occasionally gave arquebuses as gifts to individuals who converted to Christianity. Although the Iroquois first attacked their traditional enemies (the Algonquins, Mahicans, Montagnais, and Hurons), the alliance of these tribes with the French quickly brought the Iroquois into fierce and bloody conflict directly with the colonists.\n\nThe expansion of hunting for the fur trade with Europe accelerated the decline of the beaver population in the region. By 1640 the animal had largely disappeared from the Hudson Valley. Historian-editors of \"American Heritage Magazine\" have noted that the growing scarcity of the beaver in the lands controlled by the Iroquois in the middle 17th century accelerated the wars. The center of the fur trade shifted northward to the colder regions of present-day southern Ontario, an area controlled by the Neutral as well as by the Huron peoples, who were close trading partners of the French. The Iroquois, displaced in that region by other nations, and threatened by their high losses to smallpox and other infectious disease, began an aggressive campaign to expand their area of control.\n\nWith the decline of the beaver population, the Iroquois began to conquer their smaller neighbors. They attacked the Wenro in 1638 and took all of their territory. Survivors fled to the Hurons for refuge. The Wenro had served as a buffer between the Iroquois and the Neutral tribe and Erie allies. These two tribes were considerably larger and more powerful than the Iroquois. With expansion to the west blocked, the Iroquois turned their attention to the north. The Dutch also encouraged the Iroquois in this strategy. At that time, the Dutch were the Iroquois' primary European trading partners, with their goods passing through Dutch trading posts down the Hudson River and from there sent back to Europe. As the Iroquois' sources of furs declined, so did the income of the trading posts.\n\nIn 1641, the Mohawks traveled to Trois-Rivières in New France to propose peace with the French and their allied tribes. They asked the French to set up a trading post in Iroquoia. Governor Montmagny rejected this proposal because it would imply abandonment of their Huron allies.\n\nIn the early 1640s, the war began in earnest with Iroquois attacks on frontier Huron villages along the St. Lawrence River; their intent was disruption of the trade with the French. In 1645 the French called the tribes together to negotiate a treaty to end the conflict. Two Iroquois leaders, Deganaweida and Koiseaton, traveled to New France to take part in the negotiations. The French agreed to most of the Iroquois demands, granting them trading rights in New France. The next summer a fleet of eighty canoes carrying a large harvest of furs traveled through Iroquois territory to be sold in New France. When the Iroquois arrived, the French refused to purchase the furs and told the Iroquois to sell them to the Huron, who would act as a middleman. Outraged, the Iroquois resumed the war.\n\nThe French decided to become directly involved in the conflict. The Huron and the Iroquois had similar access to manpower, each tribe having an estimated 25,000–30,000 members. To gain the upper hand, in 1647 the Huron and Susquehannock formed an alliance to counter Iroquois aggression. Together their warriors greatly outnumbered those of the Iroquois. The Huron tried to break the Iroquois Confederacy by negotiating separate peaces with the Onondaga and the Cayuga. When the other tribes intercepted their messengers, they put an end to the negotiations. During the summer of 1647 there were several small skirmishes between the tribes. In 1648 a more significant battle occurred when the two Algonquin tribes attempted to pass a fur convoy through an Iroquois blockade. Their attempt succeeded and they inflicted high casualties on the Iroquois. In the early 1650s the Iroquois began attacking the French themselves, although some of the Iroquois tribes, notably the Oneida and Onondaga, had peaceful relations with the French, but were under control of the Mohawk, who were the strongest tribe in the Confederation and had animosity towards the French presence. After a failed peace treaty negotiated by Chief Canaqueese, Iroquois moved north into New France along the Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River, attacking and blockading Montreal. By 1650 they controlled the area from the Virginia Colony in the south up to the St. Lawrence. In the west, the Iroquois had driven the Algonquin-speaking Shawnee out of the Ohio Country and seized control of the Illinois Country as far west as the Mississippi River. In January 1666 the French invaded the Iroquois and took the Chief Canaqueese prisoner. In September they proceeded down the Richelieu; unable to find an Iroquois army, they resorted to burning their crops and homes. Many Iroquois died from starvation in the following winter. The 1701 Grande Paix (Great Peace) in Montreal was signed by 39 Indian chiefs, the French and the English. In the treaty, the Iroquois agreed to stop marauding and to allow refugees from the Great Lakes to return east.\n\nDuring the following years, the Iroquois strengthened their confederacy to work more closely and create an effective central leadership. Although the workings of their government remain largely unknown, by the 1660s the five Iroquois nations ceased fighting among themselves. They also easily coordinated military and economic plans among all five nations. As a result, they increased their power and achieved a level of government more advanced than the decentralized operations of the surrounding tribes.\n\nAlthough Indian raids were not constant, they terrified the inhabitants of New France. Initially, the colonists felt helpless to prevent them. Some of the heroes of French-Canadian folk memory are individuals who stood up to such attacks. Dollard des Ormeaux, for example, who died in May 1660 while resisting an Iroquois raiding force at the Long Sault, the confluence of the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa Rivers, succeeded in saving Montreal by his actions. In 1692, 14-year-old Marie-Madeleine Jarret (renowned as Madeleine de Verchères) successfully frustrated an Iroquois attack on Fort Verchères.\n\nIn 1648, the Dutch authorized selling guns directly to the Mohawk rather than through traders, and promptly sold 400 to the Iroquois. The Confederacy sent 1,000 newly armed warriors through the woods to Huron territory. With the onset of winter, the Iroquois warriors launched a devastating attack into the heart of Huron territory, destroying several key villages, killing many warriors and taking thousands of people captive, for later adoption into the tribe. Among those killed were the Jesuit missionaries Jean Brebeuf, Charles Garnier, and Gabriel Lallemant. Each is considered a martyr of the Roman Catholic Church. The surviving Huron fled their territory to seek assistance from the Anishinaabeg Confederacy in the northern Great Lakes region. The Odaawaa Nation (Ottawa) temporarily halted Iroquois expansion further northwest. With the Hurons' withdrawal, the Iroquois controlled a fur-rich region and had no more native tribes blocking them from the French settlements in Canada.\n\nEuropean diseases had taken their toll on the Iroquois and neighbors in the years preceding the war, however, and their populations had drastically declined. To replace lost warriors, the Iroquois worked to integrate many of their captured enemy by adoption into their own tribes. They invited Jesuits into their territory to teach those who had converted to Christianity. One priest recorded, \"As far as I can divine, It is the design of the Iroquois to capture all the Huron...put the Chiefs to death...and with the rest to form one nation and country\". The Jesuits also reached out to the Iroquois, many of whom converted to or added Roman Catholicism to indigenous belief. The converted Iroquois would play an important part in the years to come.\n\nIn the early 1650s, the Iroquois began to attack the French. Some of the Iroquois Nations, notably the Oneida and Onondaga, had peaceful relations with the French but were under control of the Mohawk. The latter were the strongest nation in the Confederacy and were hostile to the French presence. After a failed peace treaty negotiated by Chief Canaqueese, Iroquois war parties moved north into New France along Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River. They attacked and blockaded Montreal. Typically a raid on an isolated farm or settlement consisted of a war party moving swiftly and silently through the woods, swooping down suddenly and without warning. In many cases, prisoners, especially women and children, were brought back to the Iroquois homelands and were adopted into the nations.\n\nThe Iroquois attacked the Neutral Nation in 1650. By the end of 1651, they had completely driven the tribe from traditional territory, killing or assimilating thousands. At the time, the Neutrals inhabited a territory ranging from the present-day Niagara Peninsula, westward to the Grand River valley.\n\nIn 1654 the Iroquois attacked the Erie, but with less success. The war between the Erie and the Iroquois lasted for two years. By 1656 the Iroquois had almost completely destroyed the Erie confederacy, whose members refused to flee to the west. The Erie territory was located on the southeastern shore of Lake Erie and was estimated to have 12,000 members in 1650. Greatly outnumbered by the tribes they had subdued, the Iroquois had been able to achieve their victories through the use of firearms purchased from the Dutch.\n\nWith the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois.\n\nBy supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677.\n\nDuring the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.\n\nThe Iroquois continued to control the countryside of New France, raiding to the edges of the walled settlements of Quebec and Montreal. In May 1660 an Iroquois force of 160 warriors attacked Montreal and captured 17 colonists. The following year, an attack by 250 warriors yielded ten captives. In 1661 and 1662 the Iroquois made several raids against the Abenakis, who were allied with the French. The French Crown ordered a change to the governing of Canada. They put together a small military force made up of Frenchmen, Huron, and Algonquin to counter the Iroquois raids. When the militia ventured into the countryside, they were attacked by the Iroquois. Only 29 of the French survived and escaped. Five were captured and tortured to death by the Iroquois in retaliation. Despite their victory, the Iroquois also suffered a significant number of casualties. Their leaders began to consider negotiating for peace with the French.\n\nThe tide of war in New France began to turn in the mid-1660s with the arrival of a small contingent of regular troops from France, the brown-uniformed Carignan-Salières Regiment—the first group of uniformed professional soldiers to enter present-day Canada. A change in administration led the New France government to authorize direct sale of arms and other military support to their Native allies. In 1664, the Dutch allies of the Iroquois lost control of the New Netherland colony to the English. In the immediate years after the Dutch defeat, European support waned for the Iroquois.\n\nIn January 1666, the French invaded the Iroquois homeland in present-day New York. The first invasion force, of 400 or 500 men, was led by Daniel de Rémy de Courcelle. His men were greatly outnumbered by the Iroquois and were forced to withdraw before any significant action could take place. Although the invasion was abortive, they took Chief Canaqueese prisoner.\n\nThe second invasion force was led by the aristocrat Alexandre de Prouville, the \"Marquis de Tracy\" and viceroy of New France. From his base in Quebec City, as Lieutenant General of the Carignan-Salières Regiment, he initiated a campaign against the Mohawks. The invasion force of about 1300 men moved out in the fall of 1666. Upon arriving at the Mohawk villages and finding them deserted, they destroyed the villages and their crops. Prouville de Tracy seized all the Mohawk lands in the name of the king of France, and forced the Mohawks to accept the Roman Catholic faith and to adopt the French language as taught by the Jesuit missionaries. With their immediate European support cut off, the Iroquois sued for peace, to which France agreed.\n\nOnce peace was achieved with the French, the Iroquois returned to their westward conquest in their continued attempt to take control of all the land between the Algonquins and the French. As a result of Iroquois expansion and war with the Anishinaabeg Confederacy (see also, Council of Three Fires), eastern Nations such as the Lakota were pushed across the Mississippi onto the Great Plains. There in the early 18th century, they adopted the horse culture and nomadic lifestyle for which they later became well known. Other refugees flooded the Great Lakes area, resulting in a conflict with existing nations in the region. In the Ohio Country the Shawnee and Miami tribes were the dominant tribes. The Iroquois quickly overran Shawnee holdings in central Ohio forcing them to flee into Miami territory. The Miami were a powerful tribe and brought together a confederacy of their neighboring allies, including the Pottawatomie and the Illini confederation who inhabited modern Michigan and Illinois. The majority of the fighting was between the Anishinaabeg Confederacy and the Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe Iroquois improved on their warfare as they continued to attack even farther from their home. War parties often traveled by canoes at night. They would sink their canoes and fill them with rocks to hold them on the river bottom. After going through the woods to a target, at the appointed time, they would quickly burst from the wood to cause the greatest panic among their enemy. After the attack, the Iroquois could return quickly to their boats and leave before any significant resistance could be put together. The lack of firearms caused the Algonquin tribes the greatest disadvantage. Despite their larger numbers, they were not centralized enough to mount a united defense and were unable to withstand the Iroquois. Several tribes ultimately moved west beyond the Mississippi River, leaving much of the Ohio Valley, southern Michigan, and southern Ontario depopulated. Several large Anishinaabe military forces, numbering in the thousands, remained to the north of Lakes Huron and Superior. They later were decisive in rolling back the Iroquois advance. From west of the Mississippi, displaced groups continued to arm war parties and attempt to retake their homelands.\n\nBeginning in the 1670s, the French began to explore and settle the Ohio and Illinois Country from the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. There they discovered the Algonquin tribes of that region were locked in warfare with the Iroquois. The French established the post of Tassinong to trade with the western tribes. The Iroquois destroyed it to retain control of the fur trade with the Europeans.\n\nDuring a raid into the Illinois Country in 1689, the Iroquois captured numerous prisoners and destroyed a sizable Miami settlement. The Miami asked for aid from others in the Anishinaabeg Confederacy, and a large force gathered to track down the Iroquois. Using their new firearms, the Confederacy laid an ambush near modern South Bend, Indiana. They attacked and destroyed most of the Iroquois army. Although a large part of the region was left depopulated, the Iroquois were unable to establish a permanent presence. Their own tribe lacked the manpower to colonize the large area. After their setbacks and the local tribes' gaining firearms, the Iroquois' brief control over the region was lost. Many of the former inhabitants of the territory began to return.\n\nAs the English began to move into the former Dutch territory of upper New York State, they began to form close ties with the Iroquois. They sought to use them as a buffer and force to hinder French colonial expansion. They soon began to supply the Iroquois with firearms much as the Dutch had and encouraged them to disrupt French interests.\n\nAt the same time, Governor of New France Louis de Buade, Comte de Frontenac, tried to revive the western fur-trade. His efforts competed with those of the Iroquois to control the traffic and they started attacking the French again. The war lasted ten years and was as bloody as the first.\n\nIn 1681 René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle negotiated a treaty with the Miami and Illinois tribes. The same year France lifted the ban on the sale of firearms to the native tribes. Colonists quickly armed the Algonquin tribes, evening the odds between the Iroquois and their enemies.\n\nWith the renewal of hostilities, the local militia of New France was stiffened after 1683 by a small force of regular French navy troops, the Compagnies Franches de la Marine. The latter were to constitute the longest-serving unit of French regular troops in New France. Over the years, the men identified with the colony. The officer corps became completely Canadian. Essentially, these forces can be considered as Canada's first standing professional armed force. Officers' commissions, both in the militia and in the Compagnies Franches, became coveted amongst the upper class of the colony. The militia together with members of the Compagnies Franches, dressed for woodland travel similarly to their Algonquin Indian allies, and grew to specialize in the swift and mobile brand of warfare termed \"la petite guerre\". It was characterized by long expeditions through the forests and quick raids on enemy encampments—the same kind of warfare practiced by the Iroquois and other Natives.\n\nIn June 1687, Governor Denonville and Pierre de Troyes set out with a well-organized force to Fort Frontenac, where they met with the 50 hereditary sachems of the Iroquois Confederacy from their Onondaga council fire. These 50 chiefs constituted the entire decision-making strata of the Iroquois. They had been lulled into meeting under a flag of truce. Denonville seized, chained, and shipped the 50 Iroquois chiefs to Marseilles, France, to be used as galley slaves. He then ravaged the land of the Seneca, including their capital of Ganondagan. Before he returned to New France, he travelled down the shore of Lake Ontario and created Fort Denonville at the site where the Niagara River meets Lake Ontario. This site was previously used by La Salle for a fort named Fort Conti from 1678 to 1679, and was later used for Fort Niagara, which still exists to this day.\n\nIn September 1687, the French used 3,000 militia and regulars to attack the Mohawk Iroquois in a punitive raid on their territory. They proceeded down the Richelieu River and marched through Iroquois territory, but did not find many warriors. They burned their villages and stored crops, destroying an estimated 1.2 million bushels of corn. Many Iroquois died from starvation during the following winter.\n\nThe destruction of the Seneca and Mohawk lands infuriated the Iroquois Confederacy. This, coupled with the dishonourable loss of their sachems, demanded they set out to terrorize New France as never before. Denonville's regulars were dissolved and dispersed to towns across the land, attempting to protect New France's homes and families. Forts were abandoned. The Iroquois destroyed farmsteads and whole families were slaughtered or captured. On August 4, 1689, Lachine, a small town adjacent to Montreal, was burned to the ground. Fifteen hundred Iroquois warriors had been harassing Montreal defences for many months prior. Denonville was finally exhausted and defeated. His tenure was followed by the return of Frontenac, who replaced Denonville as governor for the next nine years (1689–1698). Frontenac had been arranging a new plan of attack to mollify the effects of the Iroquois in North America and realized the true danger the imprisonment of the sachems created. He located the 13 surviving leaders, and they returned with him to New France in October 1698.\n\nDuring King William's War (1688–1697), the French created raiding parties with native allies to attack English colonial settlements, as the English had used the Iroquois against the French. Some of the most notable of the French-sponsored raids in 1690 were the Schenectady massacre in the Province of New York; Salmon Falls, New Hampshire; and Falmouth Neck (present-day Portland, Maine). The French and their allies killed settlers in the raids and carried some back to Canada. Settlers in New England raised money to redeem their captives, but some were adopted into the Native tribes. The French government generally did not intervene when the Natives kept the captives. Throughout the 1690s the French and their allies also continued to raid deep into Iroquois, destroying Mohawk villages in 1692, and later raiding Seneca, Oneida, and Onondaga villages. The English and Iroquois banded together for operations aimed at New France, but these were largely ineffectual. The most successful incursion resulted in the 1691 Battle of La Prairie. Because France claimed dominion over the Iroquois, the French offensive was not halted by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick that brought peace between France and England, and ended overt English participation in the conflict.\n\nFinally, in 1698, the Iroquois began to see the English as becoming a greater threat than the French. The English had begun colonizing Pennsylvania in 1681. The continued colonial growth there began to encroach on the southern border of the Iroquois territory. The French policy began to change towards the Iroquois. After nearly 50 years of warfare, they began to believe that it would be impossible to ever destroy them. They decided that befriending the Iroquois would be the easiest way to ensure their monopoly on the northern fur trade and help stop English expansion. As soon as the English heard of the treaty they immediately set about to prevent it from being agreed to. It would result in the loss of Albany's monopoly on the fur trade with the Iroquois and, without their protection, the northern flank of the English colonies would be open to French attack. Despite English interference the treaty was agreed to.\n\nThe subsequent Great Peace of Montreal was signed in 1701 in Montreal by 39 Indian chiefs and the French. In the treaty, the Iroquois agreed to stop marauding and to allow refugees from the Great Lakes to return east. The Shawnee eventually regained control of the Ohio Country and the lower Allegheny River. The Miami tribe returned to take control of modern Indiana and north-west Ohio. The Pottawatomie went to Michigan, and the Illinois tribe to Illinois. With the Dutch long removed from North America, the English had become just as powerful as the French. The Iroquois came to see that they held the balance of power between the two European powers and they used that position to their benefit for the decades to come. Their society began to quickly change as the tribes began to focus on building up a strong nation, improving their farming technology, and educating their population. The peace was lasting and it would not be until the 1720s that their territory would again be threatened by the Europeans.\n\nAlso in 1701, the Iroquois nominally gave the English much of the disputed territory north of the Ohio in the Nanfan Treaty, although this transfer was not recognised by the French, who were the strongest actual presence there at the time. In that treaty, the Iroquois leadership claimed to have conquered this \"Beaver Hunting Ground\" 80 years previously, or in about 1621.\n\nCeramic, lithic, shell, and European artifacts, perhaps certain faunal remains, and aspects of longhouse interments indicate the Christian site belongs to the period when Europeans, perhaps Étienne Brûlé in 1615, first entered Neutralia. As such, the identification of the intensity of foreign manifestations are important in identifying the pervasiveness of the effect of Europeans on Neutral relationships. The Illinois Country's former inhabitants returned shortly after the war ended; the Miami, Potowatomie, Sauk, and Fox tribes became dominant in the region. The Ohio Country, which was nearer to the core of Iroquois territory, remained depopulated for longer, as the Iroquois controlled it by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The Lenape settled along the Allegheny River beginning in the 1720s. It was not until the 1740s and 1750s that the Shawnee began to return to the southern and central areas of the region, and the Miami began to resettle the western portions.\n\nThrough various European treaties, the English control over the Iroquois and their territory had been recognized before the war had ended. The English exaggerated the extent of Iroquois control in the west as a means to dispute French control of the Illinois and Ohio country. In 1768 several colonies officially purchased the \"Iroquois claim\" to the Ohio and Illinois Country. The colonies created the Indiana Land Company to hold the claim to all of the Northwest. It maintained a claim to the region using the Iroquois right of conquest until the company was dissolved by the United States Supreme Court in 1798.\n\nBecause a large part of the conflict between the native tribes took place far beyond the frontier and in locations that had yet to have European contact, the full extent and impact of the war is unknown. Most knowledge of the western parts of the conflict comes through accounts of French explorers and the tribes they encountered during the early years of exploration. Even the effects in the eastern regions are not fully known, as large parts of the region remained unexplored. The resident tribes did not have direct contact with Europeans, so no accounts were passed on about the wars.\n\nThe Beaver Wars joined the Powhatan wars of 1610–14, 1622–32 and 1644–46 in Virginia, the Pequot War of 1636 in Connecticut, Kieft's War of 1643 along the Hudson River, Peach Tree War, Esopus Wars, and King Philip's War in a list of ongoing uprisings and conflicts between various Native American tribes and the French, Dutch, and English colonial settlements of Canada, New York, and New England.\n\nNative American tribes would continue to be embroiled in conflicts involving England, France, and their colonists during the ensuing French and Indian Wars.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11172905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11172905", "title": "Benin art", "text": "Benin art\n\nBenin art is the art from the Kingdom of Benin or Edo Empire (1440–1897), a pre-colonial African state located in what is now known as the South-South region of Nigeria. Primarily made of cast bronze and carved ivory, Benin art was produced mainly for the court of the Oba of Benin - a divine ruler for whom the craftsmen produced a range of ceremonially significant objects. The full complexity of these works can be appreciated only through the awareness and consideration of two complementary cultural perceptions of the art of Benin: the Western appreciation of them primarily as works of art, and their understanding in Benin as historical documents and as mnemonic devices to reconstruct history, or as ritual objects. This original significance is of great import in Benin.\n\nGiven the stylistic differences, the art of Benin has been divided by some authors, including Egyptologist Boris de Rachewiltz in the following periods:\n\nThe royal arts of the Benin Kingdom of south-central Nigeria affirm the centrality of the oba, or divine king, portraying his divine nature. While recording the kingdom's significant historical events and the oba's involvement with them, they also initiate the oba's interactions with the supernatural and honor his deified ancestors, forging a continuity that is vital to the kingdom's well-being.\n\nThe materials used in Benin's royal arts—primarily brass, ivory, and coral—are endowed with sacred power. The innate value of these materials within Benin and the time and skill that is invested in working them reflect the earthly and otherworldly influence of the oba and the great wealth of his kingdom. Benin's royal arts belong to a tradition that favors convention even as it promotes creativity and innovation, especially as a reflection of royal prerogative. Through time, rulers have used the arts to interpret the history of the kingdom and to orient themselves with the past in an effort to support their own initiatives and define their images for posterity.\n\nAlthough only made popular to Western audiences after the Punitive Expedition in the 19th century, Benin art has been in existing since or at least the 13th century.\n\nA newly installed oba is responsible for creating an altar dedicated to his father, commissioning the appropriate objects to adorn it and activating it on a regular basis with sacrifices of food or animal blood. The oba does the same for his mother if she attained the title of iyoba, or queenmother. While bells and rattle staffs are placed on all ancestral altars, ivory tusks and commemorative brass heads are made specifically for royal altars. Associated with trade, ivory and brass are durable and valuable, and their colors—white like sacred kaolin clay and red like fire and coral beads—relate to royal power.\n\nBefore the British conquest, an oba's courtyard was the focal point for rituals in his honor. British troops reported 18 altars dedicated to previous obas when they took possession of the palace in 1897. Today, all of the royal altars stand together in a single courtyard.\n\nOne of the objects unique to Benin art is an Ikegobo, or \"altars to the hand,\" which celebrates the accomplishments of exceptional individuals. The hand is associated with action and productivity, and is considered the source of wealth, status, and success for all those who depend on manual skill and physical strength. Altars of this kind are commissioned in terracotta, wood, or brass, depending on the status of the patron.\n\n\"For the full article on art related to rituals at court see Benin court and ceremonial art\"\nPrivate and public ceremonies mark many of the important moments in Benin's yearly calendar. In the past, an elaborate series of rites were performed throughout the year to secure otherworldly support for the kingdom's well-being and to celebrate decisive events in its history. For the sake of convenience, the current monarch, Oba Erediauwa, emphasizes the end-of-year festival called Igue, which is held during the winter holidays to allow the greatest number of people to attend. Igue includes a sequence of rituals that renew the oba's supernatural powers and cleanse the kingdom's unruly spirits.\n\nBenin's other important ritual festivals include Ague, where the first budded yams are blessed in hopes of a successful harvest; Ugie Ivie, the Festival of Beads, in which the oba's coral and red stone regalia is bathed in cow's blood to reinvest it with spiritual force; Ugie Erha Oba, which honors the oba's father and all paternal ancestors; Oduduwa, a masquerade that likewise honors the oba's paternal ancestors; and Ugie Oro, celebrating Oba Esigie's victory over the Idah Kingdom in the 16th century.\n\nFinely carved ivory double gongs are examples of art related to rituals at court. They are called “double” gongs because of second, smaller resonating cups at their front. Typically, the central image is the oba in coral regalia supported by the high priests osa and osuan, officials who tend the altars of the kingdom's two patron gods. These gongs are still carried today by the oba during Emobo, the last of the empowering rites of the Igue festival. The oba gently taps the ivory instrument, creating a rhythmic sound to calm and dismiss unruly spirits from the kingdom.\n\nThe oba is referred to metaphorically as “the leopard of the house,” and images of the beautiful, cunning, and immensely dangerous cat appear frequently in Benin's royal arts. Before the British invasion in 1897, domesticated leopards were kept in the palace to demonstrate the oba's mastery over the wilderness. Leopard imagery is also frequently linked to the oba's military might.\n\nThe oba's divine right to rule is reiterated in his regalia. His coral crowns, shirts, aprons, necklaces, and accessories refer to those that Oba Ewuare is said to have stolen from Olokun, the god of the waters and prosperity. Coral and red stones such as jasper and agate are also filled with supernatural energy, or ase, as are elephant ivory and brass, two other valuable materials that the oba has historically controlled.\n\nDespite his divine status, the oba can not rule alone. He must rely on others to fulfill his destiny, a dependence that is physically expressed when he walks or sits with his arms supported at the elbows and wrists by attendants. They help him bear the weight of his regalia, a constant reminder of the burden of kingship.\n\nBrass casters (igun eronmwon) are the highest-ranking craft guild within the hierarchical structure of the Iwebo society, followed by blacksmiths (igun ematon) and ivory and wood carvers (igbesanwan).\n\nThe origins of brass casting in Benin are debated. One popular story credits Oba Oguola (enthroned c. 1280) with sending for a master brass caster from Ile Ife, the capital city of the ancient Ife Kingdom to the northwest, and with later establishing a royal brass-casting guild. Others suggest brass casting developed independently in Benin and may have mutually benefited from exchange with Ile Ife. Casters in both regions used the lost wax method, in which a precisely detailed wax model is formed over a clay core. When the model is complete, clay is carefully applied over the wax. It is then heated, melting the wax, which exits from a narrow channel. Next, molten metal is poured into the mold. Once cool, the hardened clay is chipped away, leaving behind an image now cast in bronze.\n\nThe decline of Benin art occurred in the 19th century when the Punitive expedition by the British caused impairment in the creation of the arts. On February 18, 1897, the British arrived in Benin City under orders to invade and conquer it. As a result, the possessions of the oba and his court became spoils of war. The objects were rounded up with little regard for their associated meaning; no systematic record was kept of their grouping or placement. Many of these objects were sold in London to defray the cost of the expedition.\n\n"}

He filled the posts of \"censeur du Roi\" (1766) and then Inspector General of the Domains of the Crown (1768).\n\nDuring the early 1760s, Lebrun became a disciple of Montesquieu and an admirer of the British Constitution, travelling through Southern Netherlands, the Dutch Republic, and finally to the Kingdom of Great Britain (where he witnessed the debates in the London Parliament).\n\nHe became one of Chancellor René Nicolas de Maupéou's chief advisers, taking part in his struggle against the \"parlements\" and sharing his downfall in 1774. Lebrun then devoted himself to literature, translating Torquato Tasso's \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (1774) and the \"Iliad\" (1776). He retreated from public life to his property in Grillon, attempting to live a life as envisaged by the \"philosophe\" Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During the cabinet of Jacques Necker, he was consulted on several occasions, but never appointed to high office.\n\nAt the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, he foresaw its importance in his volume \"La voix du Citoyen\", published the same year, and predicted the course which events would take. In the Estates-General and (after he took the \"Tennis Court Oath\") in the National Constituent Assembly, where he sat as deputy for the Third Estate in the bailiwick of Dourdan, he professed Liberalism and proposed various financial laws, without affiliating to any particular faction. A partisan of constitutional monarchy even after King Louis XVI's flight to Varennes (June 1791), he became the target for the suspicions of the Jacobin Club.\n\nAfter the voting of the 1791 Constitution, he was ineligible for the Legislative Assembly (like all former members of the Constituent Assembly), and became instead president of the directory of Seine-et-Oise \"département\".\n\nLebrun retired from this position on 7 August 1792, and again retired to Dourdan. Three days later, the storming of the Tuileries Palace signalled the move towards the establishment of the French Republic by the creation of the National Convention. Lebrun further aroused the indignation of republicans when he accepted to represent Dourdan in the electoral college of Seine-et-Oise which nominated deputies to the Convention.\n\nA suspect during the Reign of Terror, he was twice arrested: the first time in September 1793, liberated after the intervention of Joseph Augustin Crassous (representative on mission to Seine-et-Oise); the second time in June 1794 (paradoxically, on orders from the same Crassous) - threatened with the guillotine, he was saved by a relative of his who stole his record of prosecution, thus causing a delay long enough for Lebrun to be saved by the Thermidorian Reaction.\n\nIn 1795, Lebrun was elected as a deputy to the French Directory's Council of Ancients and, although a supporter of the House of Bourbon, he voted against prosecutions of Jacobins, and showed himself in favour of national reconciliation.\n\nLebrun was made Third Consul following Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire coup in the Year VIII (9–10 November 1799; \"see French Consulate\"). In this capacity, he took an active part in Napoleon's reorganization of the national finances and in the administration of France's \"départements\". He was made a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1803, and in 1804, he was appointed Arch-Treasurer of the French Empire. From 1805 to 1806, he was governor-general of Liguria, during which time he completed its annexation by France.\n\nHe opposed Napoleon's restoration of the \"noblesse\" and, in 1808, only reluctantly accepted the title of \"duc de Plaisance\" (Duke of Piacenza), a rare, nominal, but hereditary \"duché grand-fief\", extinguished in 1926. From 1811 to 1813, he served as governor-general of a part of the annexed Netherlands, reorganizing its \"départements\" - Zuyderzée and Bouches-de-la-Meuse. He was assisted by Antoine de Celles and Goswin de Stassart.\nAlthough to a certain extent opposed to the autocracy of the Emperor, he was not in favor of his deposition, although he accepted the \"fait accompli\" of the Bourbon Restoration in April 1814. Louis XVIII made him a Peer of France, but during the subsequent Hundred Days, he accepted from Napoleon the post of \"grand maître de l'Université\". As a consequence, he was suspended from the House of Peers when the Bourbons returned again in 1815, but was recalled in 1819. He died five years later in Sainte-Mesme (then in Seine-et-Oise, now in Yvelines).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1829223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1829223", "title": "Charlotte Bach", "text": "Charlotte Bach\n\nKaroly Hajdu (1920–1981), better-known as Charlotte Bach, was a Hungarian-British impostor who later in life became a trans woman and fringe evolutionary theorist. She developed an alternative theory of evolution which acquired a cult following among prominent writers and scientists in the London of the 1970s. They, without exception, remained ignorant of her true identity until after her death.\n\nHajdu was born near Budapest in 1920. In the wake of World War II he moved to England and in 1948 began to use the name Baron Carl Hajdu. In 1956 he collected money for Hungarian freedom fighters resisting the then Soviet occupation. \"The People\", which specialised in lurid exposés, alleged that Hajdu had pocketed the proceeds. He was found guilty of fraud in 1957, and was forced into bankruptcy.\n\nHajdu then adopted the persona of writer and society hypnotherapist Michel Karoly. He rented an apartment in Mayfair. He began to acquire a following in polite society, and wrote an agony uncle column in a mass-selling magazine of the day. Karoly continued in this role until 1965, when both his wife and stepson suddenly died. He was declared bankrupt again, and in 1966 was sentenced to two months in gaol for acquiring a loan whilst bankrupt.\n\nBy her own account, the sudden deaths had precipitated a profound identity crisis.\n\nIn 1968, Hajdu adopted the new identity of Dr Charlotte Bach, a supposed former lecturer at Budapest's Eötvös Loránd University, whose alumni included the philosophers Michael and Karl Polanyi and the mathematician John von Neumann.\n\n'Dr Bach' would openly tell lecture audiences how at first, putting ads in the windows of local newsagents, she had worked as a dominatrix. This experience had provided invaluable research data, she said, for the purpose of compiling a dictionary of psychology. These researches had in turn led to the all-embracing theory.\n\nShe lived full-time as Charlotte Bach until she died. She was thus what is sometimes referred to as a \"non-op trans woman\".\n\nIn 1971 Bach unveiled her transformative, as she would insist, theory of evolution. Among other things, she argued, it correctly displaced Darwinism in favour of Lamarckism. Drawing heavily on the work of animal ethologists such as Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz, she argued that humans experience in varying degrees a pull towards becoming the opposite sex. This urge could either be denied or \"asseverated\": gays and femme lesbians, for example, are women in men’s bodies or vice versa, but transvestites and butch lesbians are not. This gave rise to eight possible permutations.\n\nThis deep-seated and ineradicable phenomenon, she argued, was the true engine of evolutionary change. It was also the key to the proper understanding of culture—including science, politics and religion. Upon such reasoning, backed up by a polymathic accumulation of supporting evidence and a forceful lecturing style, she elaborated what she called the science of Human Ethology.\nEminent scientists who sought to engage with the apparent challenges of Bach's theory included the biologist Brian Goodwin and W. Grey Walter, a pioneer of cybernetics and former head of the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol.\n\nBach attracted the interest in particular of the English writer Colin Wilson, as well as of a number of eminent British scientists and academics. Wilson began to write about her theory. Bach became a cult figure. A small group of followers who would gather at her home at Holly Lodge in Highgate, while weekly lectures would take place elsewhere. An Institute of Human Ethology was set up to promote her ideas and stimulate further research. Her literary executors included the then professor of educational technology at Britain's Open University. She was invited to speak at Sussex University and at Darwin College, Cambridge, named in honour of the man most of whose ideas she wished to consign to the dustbin.\n\nIn due course, leading members of London's then burgeoning Gay Liberation movement—equally ignorant of Bach's true identity—took up human ethology and started publishing pamphlets of their own, much attracted by the tantalising notion of homosexuals as the vanguard of evolutionary change.\n\nBach continued to elaborate upon her original thesis up to the time of her death in 1981.\n\n\n"}

Dai is also an author who has published many influential books, articles, and journals.\n\nDai, also called Fu Ning (傅凝/傅小慶), was born in Chongqing, Sichuan in August 1941. She is the daughter of Yang Jie (楊潔) and Fu Daqing (傅大慶)—a Chinese intellectual and Communist Party martyr who was killed by the Japanese army in 1944. Dai Qing was then adopted by her father's friend, Ye Jianying (葉劍英), who was a major Chinese political figure and one of the ten marshals of the People's Liberation Army.\n\nIn 1966, Dai wrote a short story that was well accepted by the public. At that time, her daughter was about 7 to 8 years old. Unfortunately, her daughter did not have any books to read. \n\nShe then tried to study English in Nanjing (南京) for two years. This enabled her to translate English books into Chinese for her daughter. At that time, however, only a minority of Chinese could study English, such as those in the military. As Dai could not afford English education, she returned to her engineering career, working on guided missile systems.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (文化大革命) in 1966-1976, Dai and her husband, Wang Dejia (王德嘉), were sent to the countryside to be \"reformed through labour\" and worked as peasants. They were forced to leave Beijing where their daughter, Wang Xiaojia (王小嘉), lived. This showed Dai the uglier side of the Chinese government and made her realize that Chinese citizens were least important to it. After the Cultural Revolution, Dai was unable to return to her former career. Later on, she worked on surveillance equipment and after that as a writer for the People's Liberation Army (人民解放軍). In 1982, she left the Army and joined \"Guangming Daily\" (光明日報) as a news reporter.\n\nIn 1966, Dai Qing graduated from the Harbin Military Engineering Academy (哈爾濱軍事工程學院). After graduation, she furthered her studies in Japan to become an oil engineer, and she was also trained as a missile engineer. In the same year, she worked as an engineer in a top secret plant which specialized in intercontinental missiles. After working as an engineer, she started her career as a writer/news reporter.\n\nShe was noticed in 1969 when the Guangming Daily published her short story which depicted the plight of a husband and a wife separated during the Cultural Revolution. As a result, she joined the Chinese Authors Association (中國作者協會) in 1982. After publishing the short fiction, \"Pan\" (\"盼\"), she was paid high tribute as an author.\n\nShe then became a reporter for the \"Guangming Daily\" (光明日報) (\"Enlightenment Daily\") and she remained as a columnist from 1982 to 1989. Dai was the first Chinese journalist to announce the views and points of dissidents — people such as astrophysicist Fang Lizhi (方勵之), who held different political views.\n\nAt that time, Dai was a dedicated patriot. She once said that she would die if Mao Zedong (毛澤東) needed her to do so—but after three to five years, she gradually changed her stance. Dai wanted to understand her community and the lives of ordinary citizens through the eyes of a journalist. She hoped to be able to contribute to the community.\n\nDai has a quixotic style of sudden asides in her writing, which may occasionally confuse the reader. At times, her biting sarcasm may be lost on those not intimately acquainted with China's political and journalistic culture.\n\nIn 1979, when Dai Qing returned from France to China, she was sent south to cover the Sino-Vietnamese War. At that period, she decided to reveal the dark side of the Three Gorges Dam. As a famous and fearless China journalist and writer, Dai hoped her writing would encourage Chinese people to speak out and avoid repeating past mistakes. Thus, she openly opposed the Three Gorges Dam Project (三峽工程) on the Yangtze River (長江) in 1989. She regarded the project as \"the most environmentally and socially destructive project in the world\".\n\nShe collected a lot of information on the project which led to the publication of the book \"Yangtze! Yangtze!\" (是否该进行长江三峡水坝的工程). The information included interviews and essays from the Chinese scientists and journalists who also opposed the project. During the period, a conference was held in the Hall of Chinese People's Political Forum about the Three Gorges Dam, and Dai was the only reporter who attended and reported the forum. She even went to Japan in 1996 to ask the Japanese government not to provide loans or any kind of financial assistance for that project.\n\nShe argued that there was already serious emigration today, either legal or illegal, from China to other countries, like Canada, the United States, Europe and so on. The project would create a large number of refugees who had to find a place for them to reside. As a result, the legal or illegal emigration problem would be aggravated. In addition, the project would have had global effect on the climate. Dai claimed that there was a potential risk for both the Yangtze River (長江) and the Yellow River(黃河) to dry up, leading the sandstorms in Inner Mongolia to have a greater influence on Korea, Japan and even the west coast of the United States.\n\nBesides publishing \"Yangtze! Yangtze!\", she also authored many books to share her opinions, especially about the Three Gorges Dam project such as \"The River Dragon Has Come!\" (水龍來了!). However, \"Yangtze! Yangtze!\" was banned after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 on (天安門屠殺 June 4, 1989).\n\nBecause of that event, she was denounced on June 4, 1989, and quit the Chinese Communist Party on June 5, 1989. In addition, she was jailed for ten months and was not allowed to publish books in China. When she was released from jail in May 1990, she declined political asylum (政治庇護) from the United States and Germany. As a result of the event, she has been honored with several fellowships and awards.\n\nDai Qing took part in the opposition of the Three Gorges Dam project because, as a journalist, she thought that the project was environmentally destructive. Around 1986, a group of old respected Chinese scientists, including Zhou Peiyuan 周培源 and Lin Hua (林華), visited Three Gorges to inspect the region for dam construction. One day a conference was held in the Hall of the Chinese People’s Political Forum about Three Gorges which The Ministry of Media told the press not to report. As the only journalist who went to the conference, Dai did not know much about the Three Gorges Dam project. However, after the conference, she found the scientists to be very reasonable.\n\nDai's turning point came in 1987 when she made a visit to Hong Kong. She saw that every journalist and intellectual were free to express their opinions on the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River, and she was touched by their concerns for China. However, since the Chinese media was controlled by the Chinese government, even citizens who were most susceptible to the disastrous effects of the Three Gorges Dam project knew nothing about the disadvantages of building the dam. She felt ashamed because the Hong Kong media was way ahead of China's. Extremely anxious, Dai felt that it was her responsibility to let people know the opposing views about the Three Gorges Dam project. Therefore, she decided to publish a book to voice her concerns. Eventually she met a writer named Lin Feng, and after he discovered her concerns about the Three Gorges, he mailed her all the Hong Kong newspaper articles related to this issue.\n\nIn 1989, the student protest movement broke out. Dai Qing joined other scholars by calling on the government to curtail corruption and support democratic reform. When students staged large protests that included a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square, Dai Qing made a passionate speech there, encouraging students to leave peacefully to avoid bloodshed. If they stayed, she warned, they could provoke a violent crackdown that could seriously set back the process of reform. She was not heeded, and the crackdown came on June 4. Dai Qing was arrested a month later on June 14, 1989.\n\nAfter the incident, many scholars either went into hiding, were detained, or fled overseas. Dai Qing, not knowing whether to flee or not, only managed to make phone calls everyday to comfort her friends and relatives.\n\nAccording to one of her famous books, \"Wo de Ruyu\" (\"My Imprisonment\"; 我的入獄), Dai mentioned that the police had visited her the day before her imprisonment as a way of warning her. However, she did not plan to run away for her life because she loved her country. She said, \"As a citizen of a country, I cannot leave her. And I have to criticise it in order to build a more perfect and stronger one.\"\n\nOn June 14, 1989, she was arrested and started her life in prison. She understood that although she had not committed any criminal offences, she could still be convicted and be sentenced to death.\n\nShe left prison on January 21, 1990, but was kept in informal detention at a guest house for three and a half more months. She was finally released and allowed to go back home on May 9, 1990, and although she was being watched, she was granted a free atmosphere to write. She then wrote \"My Imprisonment\" (我的入獄) in which she said, \"What I can fight for is to let others know I am innocent but have a rebellious spirit.\"\n\nAs a former reporter for the Guangming Daily, she used to write frequently. However, her imprisonment after the publication of the \"Yangtze! Yangtze!\" made her change. From \"Wo de Ruyu,\" she declared she would no longer be a reporter. Since she was no longer a member of the Communist Party, she said, \"They (the Communist Party) will probably give me up, but I will not be glad to work with them neither.\"\n\nDai currently resides in Beijing. She argues that China has not yet abolished the mode of collective society from the previous eras. Therefore, she continues to fight for human rights, democracy, and environmentalism along with people in both China and the West.\n\nAccording to an article of Telegraph newspaper on November 9, 2010, Dai Qing confirmed that she would attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in December on behalf of Liu Xiaobo, who is currently serving an eleven-year prison sentence since 2009 for \"inciting subversion\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "367560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367560", "title": "Dennis Skinner", "text": "Dennis Skinner\n\nDennis Edward Skinner (born 11 February 1932) is a British politician of the Labour Party serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolsover since 1970. Skinner became the longest continuously serving Labour MP on 16 December 2017. He was Chairman of the Labour Party for one year from 1988–89 and served as a member of Labour's National Executive Committee, with brief breaks, for thirty years.\n\nHe is known for his left-wing views and is considered by some to have an acerbic wit. He is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs.\n\nBorn in Clay Cross, Derbyshire, Skinner is the third of nine children. His father Edward Skinner was a coal miner who was sacked after the 1926 general strike and his mother Lucy was a cleaner.\n\nIn 1942, at the age of 10, Skinner won a scholarship to attend Tupton Hall Grammar School after passing the eleven-plus a year early. In 1949, he went on to work as a coal miner at Parkhouse colliery until its closure in 1962. He then worked at Glapwell colliery near Chesterfield.\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 32, he became the youngest-ever president of the Derbyshire region of the National Union of Mineworkers. After working for 20 years as a miner, he became a member of Derbyshire County Council and a Clay Cross councillor in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1967, he attended Ruskin College, Oxford, after completing a course run by the National Union of Mineworkers at the University of Sheffield.\n\nIn 1956, Skinner joined the Labour Party. He was first elected as MP for the safe Labour seat of Bolsover at the 1970 general election and has retained it ever since. He was a strong supporter of the National Union of Mineworkers and their leader Arthur Scargill in the 1984-85 miners' strike.\n\nSkinner has voted for equalisation of the age of consent, civil partnerships, adoption rights for same-sex couples and to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and for same sex couples to marry, and has a strongly pro-choice stance on abortion. On 20 January 1989, he talked out a move to reduce the number of weeks at which termination of a pregnancy can be legally performed in Britain by moving a writ for the Richmond by-election. On 7 June 1985, he talked out a bill by Enoch Powell which would have banned stem cell research by moving a writ for a by-election in Brecon and Radnor. Skinner later described this as his proudest political moment.\n\nIn 2000, Skinner denounced former ally Ken Livingstone, then serving as a Labour MP. Livingstone had failed to win the party's nomination to be a candidate for Mayor of London, and had then decided to run as an independent candidate instead, urging his supporters to help Green Party candidates get elected. Skinner said that Livingstone had betrayed Labour Party activists in his Brent East constituency, whom he described as having fought for him \"like tigers\" when his majority had been small: \"He tells them he's going to be the Labour candidate, then he lies to them. To me that's as low as you can get\". He contrasted Livingstone with the official Labour candidate, Frank Dobson, saying that Dobson was \"a bloke and a half... not a prima donna ... not someone with an ego as big as a house\". Skinner said Livingstone would \"hit the headlines, but you'll never be able to trust him because he's broken his pledge and his loyalty to his party... The personality cult of the ego does not work down a coal mine and it does not work in the Labour Party\". Conversely, despite his left-wing views Skinner had a positive relationship with Prime Minister Tony Blair, a leading figure on the right of the party, stemming from advice that Skinner gave Blair regarding public speaking.\n\nIn 2003, Skinner was among the quarter of Labour MPs who voted against the Iraq War; he later rebelled against the party line when he voted against government policy to allow terror suspects to be detained without trial for ninety days. In 2007, Skinner and 88 other Labour MPs voted against the Labour government's policy of renewing the Trident Nuclear Missile System.\n\nSkinner supported David Miliband in the 2010 Labour leadership election, which was won by his brother Ed Miliband, with a very small margin. In March 2011, he was one of 15 MPs who voted against British participation in NATO's Libya intervention.\nIn 2014, he was voted off Labour's national executive committee. In the same year, he stated that he has never sent an email, and does not have a Twitter account.\n\nSkinner was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. He later supported Corbyn, alongside the majority of Labour MPs, in voting against the extension of RAF airstrikes against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Syria on Wednesday 2 December 2015.\n\nSkinner voted for Britain to leave the European Union. He favours outright abolition of the House of Lords.\n\nFollowing the death of Sir Gerald Kaufman, Dennis Skinner became the oldest serving MP, but did not become Father of the House despite being elected to parliament on the same day as Kaufman and Conservative MP Kenneth Clarke in 1970. This is due to the way seniority is calculated; when two or more MPs were elected on the same day, the one who was sworn in first is considered to be the more senior. Skinner stated in 2015 that he would not accept the honorific title.\n\nSkinner has been suspended from Parliament on at least ten occasions, usually for \"unparliamentary language\" when attacking opponents. Notable infractions have included:\n\nKnown for his republican sentiments, Skinner has regularly heckled during the annual Queen's Speech ceremony. He does this upon the arrival of Black Rod (the symbol of royal authority in the House of Lords) to summon MPs to hear the Queen's speech in the Lords' chamber. The best known, according to the \"New Statesman\" and other sources, are listed as follows:\nHe usually sits on the first seat of the front bench below the gangway in the Commons (known as the 'Awkward Squad Bench' because it is where rebel Labour Party MPs have traditionally sat) in a tweed jacket (whilst most other MPs wear suits) and signature red tie. He is known as 'the Beast of Bolsover': according to Skinner he earned the nickname for his behaviour in a tribute debate in the Commons following the death of former Conservative Prime Minister Anthony Eden - \"They were making speeches about the wonder of Anthony Eden, so I got up and talked about miners and people seriously injured and dead in the pits and the £200 given to the widow... There was booing and then all the Tories left and the papers had a go, some serious ones\".\n\nThe first official documentary about Dennis Skinner, \"Nature of the Beast\", was completed in 2017 by production company Shut Out The Light. Three years in the making, the film had its premiere at the Derby QUAD Cinema on 8 September 2017, before a UK cinema release. The documentary traces Skinner's rise to political icon status and covers his working-class upbringing, his family influences and his hobbies away from \"The Palace of Varieties\". Skinner's four surviving brothers and several of his Bolsover constituents were interviewed for the documentary.\n\nIn 1960, Skinner married Mary Parker, with whom he has three children who all attended his old school, and graduated from the University of Manchester. They separated in 1989. His current partner is former researcher Lois Blasenheim.\n\nIn 1999, Skinner was diagnosed with advanced bladder cancer and subsequently had surgery to remove a malignant tumour from his bladder. In 2003, he recovered from a double heart bypass operation.\n\nSkinner's mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease prior to her death in the 1980s. Skinner sang to his late mother when she was diagnosed with the disease and was inspired by her ability to recall old songs. Since 2008, he has visited care homes in Derbyshire to sing to elderly patients with dementia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1240442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1240442", "title": "Elphaba", "text": "Elphaba\n\nElphaba Thropp is a fictional character in \"\" by Gregory Maguire, as well as in the Broadway and West End adaptations, \"Wicked\".\n\nIn the original L. Frank Baum book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the Wicked Witch of the West is unnamed and little is explained about her life. Elphaba is modeled after the Witch portrayed by Margaret Hamilton in the classic 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\": green-skinned, clad entirely in black and wearing a tall peaked hat. Maguire formulated the name \"Elphaba\" from the phonetic pronunciation of Baum's initials L.F.B. In both adaptations, Elphaba is also called by several nicknames including Elphie, Fabala, Sister (Saint) Aelphaba, Auntie Witch, and Fae.\n\nElphaba is the illegitimate daughter of Melena Thropp and the Wizard of Oz. She was conceived when the Wizard drugged and raped Melena. Elphaba does not discover her true father's identity until later in her life, and grows up believing that her mother's husband Frexspar is her father. Through her mother, she can lay claim to the highest held title of Munchkinland, the Eminent Thropp. Frexspar, the unionist minister and missionary, is her mother’s husband. Nessarose (later the Wicked Witch of the East), and Shell, the Emperor of Oz after the wizard's departure, are her half siblings. Because of her noble ancestry, Elphaba bears the title of \"Thropp Third Descending\".\n\nFrex favors Nessarose over Elphaba, a source of constant resentment. Nessarose is almost comically pious, the preeminent quality the zealous Frexspar desires in a daughter. While Elphaba is born with green skin, Nessarose is considered beautiful, although she is born without arms. During her visit to Munchkinland near the end of the fourth section of the book, Elphaba discovers that the Quadling Turtle Heart may in fact have fathered Nessarose, and was also her mother's lover.\n\nElphaba attends Shiz University where she eventually becomes best friends with Galinda (later \"Glinda\") and Boq. She also meets Fiyero, the Crown Prince of the Vinkus (Winkie Country), who later falls in love with her. Nessarose later joins Elphaba at Shiz. It is also at this time that Elphaba first meets Madame Morrible, the head of Crage Hall (the part of the university open to women) and develops a dislike for her that soon becomes a hatred due to the belief that Madame Morrible's Tik Tok, Grommetik, is responsible for the death of her favourite professor, a sentient goat by the name of Doctor Dillamond. Later on in life Elphaba attempts to kill Madame Morrible several times; the last time she attempts this, she finds Madame Morrible already dead, so Elphaba claims credit for killing her. Frex sends Nessarose a beautiful pair of jewelled slippers as a gift (these slippers are later enchanted by Galinda to enable Nessarose to walk without assistance). Elphaba pretends not to care that she received no gift from their father, but toward the end of the novel, the shoes become an obsession for her, as she sees them as a symbol of Frex's favoritism.\n\nAfter meeting the Wizard she becomes increasingly disgusted with the ever-more tyrannical and anti-sentient-animal policies of the Wizard (even more so after the murder of Doctor Dillamond), Elphaba drops out of Shiz and takes up residence in the Emerald City, where she joins a resistance movement.\n\nElphaba later meets up with Fiyero again and eventually permits him to keep coming back as long as he doesn't disclose her location. The two fall in love with Elphaba constantly asking Fiyero questions about her old friends. They begin an affair, despite the fact that Fiyero is married with three children (Irji, Manek and Nor), but Elphaba refuses to let Fiyero touch her below the waist.\n\nFiyero is eventually murdered by the Gale Force (the Wizard's secret police) after disregarding Elphaba's instructions to stay away from Corn Exchange where she squats while she is taking part in an operation for the resistance. When Elphaba returns she finds the floor covered in blood; though no body is ever found it is implied that no human could survive blood loss of that magnitude. Severely traumatized and covered in Fiyero's blood, Elphaba makes her way to a nearby mauntery (nunnery) where she lapses into a stupor for a year. While in this state, Elphaba may have carried to term and given birth to a son, Liir. Elphaba cares for him along with other children as part of her duties at the mauntery, and during this time does not consciously consider herself to be the boy's mother. She only starts to consider that she might be Liir's mother (though for the most part, continuing to remain below her deliberate consciousness) when she readies to leave the mauntery and is told she must take him with her. Liir doesn't seem to resemble either Elphaba or Fiyero and lacks her green skin.\n\nFollowing her return to consciousness, Elphaba spends another year recuperating and a further seven tending the terminally ill in the mauntery. After this, she visits Fiyero's wife, Sarima, seeking forgiveness for her part in Fiyero's death. Sarima welcomes her and allows her to live at Fiyero's castle of Kiamo Ko. Though Elphaba had only intended to stay at Kiamo Ko a short time, Sarima refuses to even talk about Fiyero and so she resigns herself to living in the castle indefinitely. Sarima also calls Elphaba \"Auntie Guest\" and the children end up calling Elphaba \"Auntie Witch\" behind her back. Elphaba eventually gives in to this name even though she initially resented it.\n\nThough Elphaba had once considered sorcery to be nothing more than \"entertainment\" and was not interested in studying the art, she is revealed to have taken correspondence courses in magic during her time living in the Emerald City. While living at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba discovers the Grimmerie (a book containing vast magical knowledge) in the attic of the castle. Using the limited amount of information that she can decipher from the cryptic book, she begins to practice sorcery with greater success than ever before. She mainly uses sorcery to aid, enhance and further the scientific investigations initially begun by Doctor Dillamond while she was at Shiz, her main use of sorcery is creating flying monkeys.\n\nThe Wizard's Gale Forcers eventually capture Sarima and her family, Nor is later revealed to be the only survivor. Elphaba is left unsatisfied as Sarima can no longer provide the forgiveness she desires and plunges into madness.\n\nAfter Nessarose is crushed by Dorothy Gale's house, Elphaba attends her sister's funeral, where she meets with Glinda. The two are initially happy to be reunited, but when Elphaba learns that Glinda has given Nessarose's shoes to Dorothy, she is enraged, and this sparks a conflict between the two women which remains unresolved at the time of Elphaba's death.\n\nThe possibility of Elphaba coming back to life in a future novel in the series has been widely debated among Maguire's legions of fans for many years. The reason many seem to think that Elphaba will eventually return to Oz is because of the ending of \"Wicked\". The bucket splash that supposedly ends her life connects to the novel's fable of Saint Aelphaba, for whom Elphaba is named, who was said to disappear beyond a waterfall, she returned several hundred years later before once again disappearing behind the waterfall. This in turn connects Elphaba with the stories that Sarima tells her children about a wicked witch who disappears into a cave. At the end of the story it's tradition that the children ask if the witch ever comes out, to which Sarima replies \"not yet\". At the end of \"Wicked\", that dialogue is repeated and \"not yet\" are actually the final two words that close out the book, suggesting that Elphaba will eventually rise again. Furthermore, in several interviews, Maguire has stated \"a witch may die, but she will always come back - always.\"\n\nFurther evidence of the possible resurrection of Elphaba were brought to light towards the end of the 2008 novel \"A Lion Among Men\" (the third book in the series), when the character of Yackle (Yackle was always present in Elphaba's life in various forms, whether Elphaba was aware of it or not) is about to die. Before she does, she seems to have a realization of some sort and says \"of course- she's coming back. Don't you understand, she's coming back!\" However, the identity of the \"she\" to whom Yackle was referring remains ambiguous, as she dies before she can make herself understood. Many fans of the series think that she was talking about Elphaba, while others believe she may have been talking about the long-lost Ozma. This is continued to some extent in \"Out of Oz\"; when Rain, Elphaba's granddaughter, returns to Kiamo Ko and finds Nanny still alive under the care of an equally elderly Chistery. It is revealed that Nanny closed and locked the door of the tower room Elphaba died in, disallowing anyone to go in. Rain repeatedly asks her what she saw and she refuses to say. However, it may be that Elphaba's return is actually Rain herself, since once the spell disguising her green skin is removed she looks exactly like Elphaba.\n\nFor the musical \"Wicked\", Elphaba was written to be less cynical, more likable, and far more sympathetic than the novel counterpart. Her only abnormality is her green skin. In the book, Elphaba virtually goes insane, and genuinely becomes \"wicked\", though understandably so. In the musical, Elphaba is framed by the Wizard and Madame Morrible for crimes she \"committed\" on the Wizard's orders, and because she refused to turn her powerful magic to the wizard's sickening cause. Therefore, the public turns against her. She never truly turns wicked though she is depressed and frustrated that she could not save Fiyero.\nLiir, Sarima and her children are not present in the musical, and a love triangle with Fiyero and Glinda exists instead of the posthumous one (after Fiyero's death) with Sarima. The young Elphaba shows interest in sorcery from the beginning of her education, as opposed to having it thrust upon her as in the book. Elphaba is explicitly shown to survive at the end, and goes to live a life beyond Oz with Fiyero, where in the book her impending resurrection is only hinted. Elphaba is also the creator of the Tin Woodman (through a spell to save Boq, who had had his heart shrunken to apparent non-existence by Nessarose), the Scarecrow (through a spell with which she attempts to save Fiyero from being tortured to death on her account) and the Cowardly Lion (the Lion Cub she rescued from the class after Doctor Dillamond's removal); in the book the former is a result of an axe bewitched by Nessarose, and the latter's existence has nothing to do with Fiyero, other than her slight suspicion that he might indeed be her love coming back to find her, which just proves to be a paranoid delusion. Elphaba also has a less significant vendetta with Madame Morrible in the musical than in the book: In the novel, Elphaba relentlessly attempts to kill Morrible, but in the musical, Elphaba has virtually nothing to do with her after the conclusion of the first act, being more focused on the Wizard.\n\nHer relationship with Glinda (called \"\"Ga\"linda\" until she renames herself in the latter part of the first act claiming it to be in honor of Doctor Dillamond, in fact it is an attempt to get Fiyero to notice her again) is a central feature of the musical. As in the novel, the two initially despise each other, but eventually develop a strong friendship. For a while, Elphaba goes along with Glinda's attempts to make her popular, but her rebellious and revolutionary nature ultimately forces her to reject both social and political popularity in favor of doing what she knows to be right in fighting to save the Animals. Just prior to Elphaba's supposed melting, the two confess that each has been changed by their friendship. In addition, Elphaba admits that Glinda was the only friend she ever had, and Glinda replies that Elphaba was the only friend she has ever had who really mattered.\n\nElphaba demonstrates a natural talent in the field of sorcery early in the musical, and is selected by Madame Morrible to be tutored personally. She progresses quickly, and is eventually called before the Wizard of Oz himself, with a view to becoming his \"magic Grand Vizier\". However, she learns that the Wizard is in fact a powerless fraud after he tricks her into creating the flying monkeys which he plans to use as spies. Elphaba steals the Grimmerie from him and sets herself up as a rebel. In retaliation, the Wizard has Madame Morrible spread the rumor that Elphaba is a \"Wicked Witch\", to turn the public against her. She becomes the subject of national hatred thereafter, and her attempts to convince the people as to the Wizard's corrupt rule are regarded as slander. As more and more of her friends turn against her, Elphaba gradually comes to accept her reputation as a villain, and the supposed death of Fiyero is what finally causes her to embrace it completely. However, when she realizes that Fiyero has in fact survived, Elphaba acknowledges the mistakes she has made in her life, and decides to get a fresh start outside of Oz.\n\nIn the musical, Elphaba's aversion to water is no more than one of several ridiculous rumors started by those who fear her. Elphaba uses this to her advantage by disappearing when Dorothy throws a bucket of water at her, fooling everyone into believing she has been killed, even though she just went down a trapdoor.\n\nThe role was originated on Broadway and in London by Idina Menzel, who won the 2004 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\nActresses to be billed in the lead role in various productions include\n\nBroadway, New York\n\n1st US National Tour (\"Emerald City\")\n\n\n2nd US National Tour (\"Munchkinland\")\n\nMexico City\nChicago, Illinois\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nSan Francisco, California\nSão Paulo, Brazil\n\nWest End (London) Production\n\nUK & Ireland Tour\nStuttgart, Germany\n\nOberhausen, Germany\n\nScheveningen, The Netherlands\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nOsaka, Japan\n\nBrisbane, Australia\n\nAuckland, New Zealand\n\nFukuoka, Japan\nSeoul, South Korea \n\n(They have shared the role of Elphaba equally through the entire run).\n\n\nElphaba is born green skin, and several theories are put forward in the book to explain the phenomenon. Melena sees the color as a punishment for her infidelity to her husband. Frexspar originally sees it because of his careless words “The devil is coming” on the day of her birth, and later as punishment for his failure to protect his parishioners from the Clock of the Time Dragon. Elphaba's deciduous teeth are all extremely sharp, and in early childhood, she possesses an urge to bite everything around her, including herself. When these teeth fall out in due course, they are replaced by an ordinary set of permanent teeth, and this is a source of great relief to her parents. Elphaba is also unusual in that she is apparently allergic to water, and avoids touching it at all times, never crying or bathing. She cleans herself by rubbing oil into her skin.\n\nShe has a power that she cannot control. This shows mainly when she is angered. An example is when she sees Chistery trapped on an island in the middle of a lake. Ignoring her allergy to water, she jumps into the lake to save the monkey. However, when Elphaba touches the water it turns to ice for her. Liir said the weather changed to suit Elphaba's needs.\n\nElphaba is portrayed as an aspiring revolutionary, perhaps inspired by her childhood days in Quadling Country, whose ecosystem and people were stricken by the government’s ruthless ruby mining and road building efforts in the area. She is shown as a passionate supporter of Animal rights (\"A\"nimals, as opposed to \"a\"nimals, are capable of speech and advanced thought). Elphaba speaks out against Madame Morrible’s anti-Animal poetry and over the summer works with Doctor Dillamond, a Goat, to find the biological difference between Animals, animals, and humans. She protects a lion cub in a life sciences class and refuses to eat meat that could have come from Animal sources. Her revolutionary goals fade after her failed assassination attempt on Madame Morrible’s life and the death of Fiyero at the hands of the Wizard's guards.\n\nAs in the book, Elphaba is born with green skin. In the musical, however, the cause of her pigmentation is due to her mother having imbibed a green elixir before being seduced by Elphaba's biological father. Similar to the novel, Elphaba is disliked by her father and has indescribable powers. An example of this is when Madame Morrible insists that she take on Nessarose by herself. Elphaba becomes upset by this. Consequently, the students are immediately torn away from Nessarose and the wheelchair spins until it is back in her hands. Like in the book, Elphaba is a strong supporter of Animals, taking a liking to Doctor Dillamond. It is shown that Elphaba is not allergic to water in the play, for when Dorothy throws the water on her, she merely falls through a trap door and remains until Fiyero comes to save her (having since been turned into a scarecrow). Unlike the book, Elphaba never turns purely wicked, but does accept that this is how the rest of Oz sees her, and eventually gives in to the title of 'The Wicked Witch of the West.'\n\nIn the book, Elphaba does not possess the same knack for magic as her musical counterpart. She has a hidden magic power, but it only emerges when she is moved to extreme anger. This happens twice in the book: Once when the cook of the caravan she is going with to get to the Vinkus threatens to cook Liir after Elphaba had complained about the cook's cruelty to Animals. Shortly thereafter, cook is found dead, his corpse severely swollen as if he had been attacked by bees. Elphaba had some bees with her on the journey, and it is strongly implied that she may have psychically influenced them to kill the cook. She denies that she had done anything to him until the Elephant, Princess Nastoya, tells her that she has a hidden power. The second time she uses this power is when Sarima's son, Manek had convinced Liir to hide in the fish well and left him there. Liir nearly drowns, but they are just in time to save him. Elphaba realizes she has motherly feelings for Liir, but her anger at Manek causes her power to jump out again, this time making an icicle fall on Manek and kill him. Each time her power shows itself, it is to protect Liir, and on both occasions, it results in a death.\n\nAnother demonstration of Elphaba's innate power occurs when she rescues the infant snow monkey which she later names Chistery: Seeing the monkey stranded on an island in the middle of a lake, Elphaba feels compelled to save him, and runs toward the island despite her mortal allergy to water. As her feet make contact with the surface of the lake, a pane of ice forms beneath them, allowing her to reach the island unharmed. The others in the caravan speculate that the lake had previously been enchanted by a magician, but when Liir recalls the incident in \"Son of a Witch\", he claims that \"The world conformed itself to suit her needs\", implying that Elphaba did indeed cause the ice to appear, as well as possibly categorizing this power as a form of reality warping. Of course, Liir was rather young at the time, and as he himself admits, he may simply have over-romanticized the incident in his mind. Apart from those incidents, there are others that may or may not be attributed to Elphaba's dormant powers, such as the storm that only she and her roommate Galinda notice or the horns that attack Fiyero. Any magically empowered character in the Land of Oz could well have provoked both these last events.\n\nIn the musical, Elphaba possesses the ability to perform a magical attack on anyone toward whom she feels anger. She uses this power twice: Following the song \"Dear Old Shiz\", Madame Morrible insists upon caring for Nessarose, something that Elphaba has always done herself. When the headmistress ignores her objections, she flies into a rage, and somehow causes everyone standing around Nessarose's wheelchair to be thrown backward. The chair then spins in place for several seconds before reversing into Elphaba's hands. She uses this power a second time when, following the firing of Doctor Dillamond, the new History teacher brings a caged lion cub into the classroom and announces that he intends to prevent the Animal from learning to talk. This enrages Elphaba, and she uses her magic to throw everyone away from the cage and subsequently immobilize them long enough to take the lion cub out of the room and set it free. In this instance, her power does not affect Fiyero, the first suggestion that she may have feelings for him.\n\nBesides her specific powers, Elphaba's musical counterpart has amazing power and proficiency with magic in general, to the extent that Madame Morrible insists that she be tutored in sorcery individually. Elphaba can perform the spells of the Grimmerie (reputed to be the most powerful in all the Land of Oz) with ease, even succeeding in creating an effective result when the subject of the spell is many miles away and when she has adapted the incantation to suit the circumstance in which it is used. An example of such a success when both of the aforementioned problems have been in play is the spell she used to save Fiyero from death, although admittedly that spell has the unintended effect of transforming him into a scarecrow. She has also used the book's spells to accomplish feats that appear to be impossible for Ozian magicians, such as enabling things to fly. Toward the end of the musical, it is revealed that the Wizard is in fact Elphaba's father, and Madame Morrible attributes Elphaba's immense magical power to the fact that \"she was a child of both worlds\".\n\nIn both the musical and the novel, Elphaba is shown to have certain precognitive and/or clairvoyant abilities. In the book, the focal point of this power is a mirror made for her by Turtle Heart. She uses the mirror as a scrying tool in early childhood, and through it foresees several events, including the arrival of the Wizard in Oz. Her clairvoyant abilities are in evidence at two points during the musical: During the song \"The Wizard and I\", Elphaba sings of how she has just experienced \"a vision almost like a prophecy\", in which she foresees that one day, all of Oz will hold a celebration all to do with her. In a tragic twist, this actually turns out to be the celebration that takes place following her supposed death. The second reference to this ability occurs when she has a vision of Dorothy's house flying through the sky, accompanied by a feeling that Nessarose is in danger. Her seeing the house could be regarded as simply catching sight of it as it is carried by the cyclone, however the fact that Fiyero, who was with her at the time, could not see it seems to support the theory of its being a vision.\n\nElphaba is able to read the Grimmerie despite the fact that the book is written in 'the lost language of spells'. She first demonstrates this talent when the Wizard asks her to perform a levitation spell on one of his pet monkeys as proof of her powers; she finds exactly the right spell within seconds, reads it as easily as she would her own language, and makes it work perfectly on her first try. However, although she has an instinctive knack for knowing which spell is appropriate in certain cases, and can pronounce the words of the language, she later reveals that she does not actually understand what they mean. In the novel, Elphaba also possesses the ability to read the Grimmerie, but with nowhere near the same facility. She is able to understand fragments of the text, but admits that most of it is \"misty to [her] eyes\". Despite this, she gleans much magical knowledge from the book over her many years of studying it, and puts the knowledge to good use. In the novel, the Grimmerie is revealed to have been created on Earth, which is why it is illegible to the people of Oz. However, being of mixed Ozian and Earthly blood, Elphaba possesses a natural ability to at least partially understand the contents of the book.\n"}

O. \"Potch\" Didier\n\nFabius Odell Didier Jr., known as Potch Didier (November 17, 1919 – September 10, 2007), was a flamboyant Democratic sheriff of Avoyelles Parish in south Central Louisiana, who served from 1960 to 1980. In 1970, Didier (pronounced DID E A) was tried and convicted of malfeasance in office, and served a seven-day sentence in his own parish jail.\n\nThe newspaper publisher Jim R. Levy (born 1934), formerly of the \"Bunkie Record\" in Bunkie in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, said that Didier was \"the best sheriff Avoyelles Parish ever had.\"\n\nDidier was born in 1919 in Marksville, Louisiana, the parish seat of Avoyelles Parish. His family was French, with both of his parents descended from direct French immigrants to Avoyelles: his father was Fabius Didier, Sr. (1895–1970), and his mother was the former Bessie Neck (1896–1977, pronounced NICK). He was reared in the Roman Catholic church. His younger brother Homer Woodall Didier was born in 1921. They attended local schools, which were segregated in those years. Didier graduated from Centenary College of Louisiana, a Methodist institution in Shreveport.\n\nHe entered local Democratic Party politics in what was then a one-party state, following the Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of blacks]], who had constituted much of the Republican Party. He ran for but was defeated in a school board race. In the 1955 Democratic primary for parish sheriff, he lost the nomination to T. Jack Jeansonne. Four years later, when Didier was 40, he unseated Jeansonne. He was re-elected four times in succession, serving a total of five terms over two decades.\n\nAccording to Jim R. Levy, publisher of the \"Bunkie Record\", Didier and Parish District Attorney Charles Riddle Jr. became at odds. Riddle filed charges in 1970 and the case went to trial. John Boatner prosecuted for the DA's office, and Joe Tritiko, a prominent attorney from Lake Charles, was the defense counsel for Didier.\n\nLevy explains:\n\nIt was the biggest trial in the parish, It was an amazing spectacle. When it was all over, Potch was sentenced to ninety days in the parish jail, meaning he would only have to serve 45 days. He ended up serving just seven days with good behavior, which he would serve in his own jail (in the parish seat of Marksville). I remember that first night he began his sentence, he cooked an andouille gumbo. He served his sentence, and eventually everything got back to normal, In fact, he was re-elected ... again in 1972 and 1975.\n\nAvoyelles Parish has been known for political corruption. Its best-known local resident, former Governor Edwin Washington Edwards, served a ten-year sentence for extortion. Didier ranks second in the late 20th century for notoriety but his malfeasance conviction was for a much lesser crime. Didier's successor as sheriff, Bill Belt, also ran afoul of the law.\n\nAnother Avoyelles resident, former Marksville Mayor Raymond Laborde (1958–1970), who served as State Representative (1972–1992), finished his political career as Edwards' last Commissioner of Administration (1992–1996). Laborde, however, was known for his \"good-government\" policies. In 1972, he once temporarily blocked a tax increase sought by Edwards, a friend from childhood. Laborde still operates his Raymond's Department Store, which he opened in Marksville in 1949.\n\nOn New Years Day, 1980, Didier, as the outgoing president of the politically influential Louisiana Sheriff's Association and a lame duck sheriff, had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The latter was being challenged for renomination by U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Contents of the conversation were not disclosed. Carter gained a second Democratic nomination, but he lost Louisiana (and the country) to the Republican Ronald W. Reagan.\n\nDidier served five terms; he did not seek reelection in the nonpartisan blanket primary held in October 1979. He was succeeded by Bill Belt, who defeated Marksville Police Chief Mike Neck for the position. Neck was a distant cousin of Didier.\n\nAfter retiring as sheriff, Didier was involved with the Sheriffs Association and similar groups.\n\nDidier's second wife and mother of his second-born son Fabius was Julia D. Didier (May 25, 1926–February 20, 2007). In 2007, some six months after Julia's death, Didier died at a nursing home in Mansura, two months before what would have been his 88th birthday.\n\nHis surviving sons are Marcel Furlow Didier (born 1947), formerly of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and wife Lydia M. Didier; and Fabius Anthony Didier (born 1951) and wife, Deborah Dupuy Didier, of Marksville; a brother, Homer Woodall Didier (born 1921) and wife, the former Ruby Nell Bond, of Denham Springs in Livingston Parish; and two grandchildren, Damon Anthony Didier (born 1979), then of Plaucheville, and Shanti Marie Didier Odom (born 1981), then of Alexandria. Memorial services were held on September 20, 2007, at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Marksville. Didier was cremated.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Damon Didier re-enacted a speech of his grandfather's at the Marksville bicentennial ceremony.\n"}

{"id": "981757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=981757", "title": "Hugh O'Flaherty", "text": "Hugh O'Flaherty\n\nHugh O'Flaherty CBE (28 February 1898 – 30 October 1963), was an Irish Catholic priest and senior official of the Roman Curia, and significant figure in Catholic resistance to Nazism. During World War II, the monsignor was responsible for saving 6,500 Allied soldiers and Jews. His ability to evade the traps set by the German \"Gestapo\" and \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD), earned O'Flaherty the nickname \"The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican\".\n\nShortly after Hugh O'Flaherty's birth in Lisrobin, Kiskeam, County Cork, his parents, James and Margaret, moved to Killarney. The family lived on the golf course where James O'Flaherty worked as a steward. By his late teens, young O'Flaherty had a scratch handicap and a scholarship to a teacher training college.\n\nHowever, in 1918 he enrolled at Mungret College, a Jesuit college in County Limerick dedicated to preparing young men for missionary priesthood. Normally, students ranged from 14 to 18 years of age. At the time when O'Flaherty came in, he was a little older than most of the students, about 20. The college allowed for some older people to come in if they had been accepted by a bishop who would pay for them.\n\nO'Flaherty's sponsor was the Bishop of Cape Town, Cornelius O'Reilly, in whose diocese he would be posted after ordination, a big step for a young man who had never set foot outside of Munster. At the time when O'Flaherty was in Mungret, the Irish War for Independence was ongoing. He was posted to Rome in 1922 to finish his studies and was ordained on 20 December 1925. He would never join his diocese. Instead, he stayed to work for the Holy See, serving as a Vatican diplomat in Egypt, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Czechoslovakia. In 1934, he was appointed a papal chamberlain with the title monsignor. In 1953 he was named a domestic prelate.\n\nIn the early years of World War II, The Very Rev. Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty (as he was then) toured prisoner of war (POW) camps in Italy and tried to find out about prisoners who had been reported missing in action. If he found them alive, he tried to reassure their families through Radio Vatican.\n\nWhen Mussolini was removed from power by the King in 1943, thousands of Allied POWs were released; however, when Germany imposed an occupation over Italy, they were in danger of recapture. Some of them, remembering visits by O'Flaherty, reached Rome and asked him for help. Others went to the Irish embassy to the Holy See, the only English-speaking embassy to remain open in Rome during the war. Delia Murphy, who was the wife of Dr Thomas J. Kiernan, the Irish ambassador (and, in her day, a well-known ballad singer), was one of those who helped O'Flaherty.\n\nMonsignor O'Flaherty did not wait for permission from his superiors. He recruited the help of other priests (including two young New Zealanders, Fathers Owen Snedden and John Flanagan), two agents working for the Free French, François de Vial and Yves Debroise, and even communists and a Swiss count. One of his aides was British Major Sam Derry, a POW escapee. Derry along with British officers and escaped POWs Lieutenants Furman and Simpson, and Captain Byrnes, a Canadian, were responsible for the security and operational organisation. O'Flaherty also kept contact with Sir D'Arcy Osborne, British Ambassador to the Holy See, and his butler John May (whom O'Flaherty described as \"a genius ... the most magnificent scrounger\"). O'Flaherty and his allies concealed 4,000 escapees, mainly Allied soldiers and Jews, in flats, farms and convents. One of the first hideouts was beside the local \"SS\" headquarters. O'Flaherty and Derry coordinated all this. When outside the Vatican, O'Flaherty wore various disguises. The German occupiers tried to stop him and eventually they found out that the leader of the network was a priest. \"SS\" attempts to assassinate him failed. They learned his identity, but could not arrest him inside the Vatican. When the German ambassador revealed this to O'Flaherty, he began to meet his contacts on the stairs of St. Peter's Basilica. \n\n\"Obersturmbannführer\" Herbert Kappler, the head of the \"SS Sicherheitsdienst\" and \"Gestapo\" in Rome, learned of O'Flaherty's actions; he ordered a white line painted on the pavement at the opening of St. Peter's Square (signifying the border between Vatican City and Italy), stating that the priest would be killed if he crossed it. Ludwig Koch, head of the Fascist police in Rome, often spoke of his intention to torture O'Flaherty before executing him if he ever fell into his hands.\n\nSeveral others, including priests, nuns and lay people, worked in secret with O'Flaherty, and even hid refugees in their own private homes around Rome. Among these were the Augustinian Maltese Fathers Egidio Galea, Aurelio Borg and Ugolino Gatt, the Dutch Augustinian Father Anselmus Musters and Brother Robert Pace of the Brothers of Christian Schools. Another person who contributed significantly to this operation was the Malta-born widow Chetta Chevalier who hid some refugees in her house with her children, and escaped detection. Jewish religious services were conducted in the Basilica di San Clemente, which was under Irish diplomatic protection, under a painting of Tobias.\n\nWhen the Allies arrived in Rome in June 1944, 6,425 of the escapees were still alive. O'Flaherty demanded that German prisoners be treated properly as well. He took a plane to South Africa to meet Italian POWs and to Jerusalem to visit Jewish refugees. Of the 9,700 Jews in Rome, 1,007 had been shipped to Auschwitz. The rest were hidden, 5,000 of them by the official Church − 3,000 in Castel Gandolfo, 200 or 400 (estimates vary) as \"members\" of the Palatine Guard and some 1,500 in monasteries, convents and colleges. The remaining 3,700 were hidden in private homes.\n\nAt the time of the liberation of Rome, O'Flaherty's and Derry's organisation was caring for 3,925 escapees and men who had succeeded in evading arrest. Of these 1,695 were British, 896 South African, 429 Russian, 425 Greek and 185 American. The remainder were from 20 different nations. This does not include Jews and sundry other men and women who were in O'Flaherty's personal care.\nAfter the war Monsignor O'Flaherty received a number of awards, including Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and the US Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. He was also honoured by Canada and Australia. He refused to use the lifetime pension that Italy had given him. In the 1950s, the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, in the form proposed by the now-canonised Mary Faustina Kowalska, was under a ban from the Vatican. It was O'Flaherty who, as Notary, signed the document that notified Catholics of the ban. He was the first Irishman named Notary of the Holy Office.\n\nO'Flaherty regularly visited his old nemesis Herbert Kappler (the former \"SS\" chief in Rome), in prison, month after month, being Kappler's only visitor. In 1959, Kappler converted to Catholicism and was baptised by O'Flaherty.\n\nIn 1960, O'Flaherty suffered a serious stroke during Mass and was forced to return to Ireland. Shortly before his first stroke in 1960, he was due to be confirmed as the Papal Nuncio to Tanzania. He moved to Cahersiveen to live with his sister, at whose home he died on 30 October 1963, aged 65. He was buried in the cemetery of the Daniel O'Connell Memorial Church in Cahersiveen. There is a monument in Killarney town and a grove of trees dedicated to his memory in the Killarney National Park.\nSome sources incorrectly state that, in 2003, he became the first Irish person honoured as Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel.\n\nO'Flaherty was portrayed by Gregory Peck in the 1983 television film, \"The Scarlet and the Black\", which follows the exploits of O'Flaherty from the German occupation of Rome to its liberation by the Allies. \n\nHe was also the second principal character in a radio play by Robin Glendinning on Kappler's time seeking asylum in the Vatican, titled \"The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican\", which was first broadcast on 30 November 2006 on Radio 4, with Wolf Kahler as Kappler. \n\nKillarney-born actor and playwright Donal Courtney penned a new one man play entitled \"God has no Country\" which he premièred in Killarney as part of the Hugh O Flaherty memorial celebrations for 3 nights in October 2013. Courtney portrays the monsignor during the wartime years in German occupied Rome and the story is told from the monsignor's point of view and is a study of the torment and difficulty in the decisions he undertook in his fight for justice.\n\nThe Irish-language television station TG4 broadcast a 51-minute documentary on Monsignor O'Flaherty in 2008. It is available (in mixed Irish/English with English subtitles) on a region-free DVD entitled \"The Pimpernel of the Vatican – The Amazing Story of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty\".\n\n\n"}

At the age of eighteen, he and an elder brother, moved to the desert of Scetes where he became a disciple of Saint Pambo and a good friend of Saint Pishoy. He lived a life of austerity and taught several other monks his way of life, among them was Arsenius the Great.\n\nAfter the departure of Saint Pambo, John was ordained a priest by Pope Theophilus and became abbot of the monastery he founded around the Tree of Obedience. When the Berbers invaded Scetes in 395, John fled the Nitrian Desert and went to live on Mount Colzim, near the present city of Suez, where he died.\n\nIn 515, the relics of Saint John the Dwarf were moved to the Nitrian Desert. His feast is celebrated on October 17 in the Roman Catholic Church, on 20 Paopi at the Coptic Orthodox Church and on November 9 in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Monastery of Saint John the Dwarf in Scetes is now deserted.\n\nJohn the Dwarf is best known for his obedience. The most famous story about his obedience is that one day Saint Pambo gave Abba John a piece of dry wood and ordered him to plant and water it. John obeyed and went on watering it twice a day even though the water was about 12 miles from where they lived. After three years, the piece of wood sprouted and grew into a fruitful tree. Pambo took some of this tree's fruits and went around to all the elder monks, saying \"take, eat from the fruit of obedience\". Postumian, who was in Egypt in 402, assured that he was shown this tree which grew in the yard of the monastery and which he saw covered with shoots and green leaves.\n\nJohn Cassian tells a similar story of John of Egypt, only he was asked to tend the stick only one year, it did not bloom, and after this test of obedience his superior threw the stick away. According to William Harmless, \"Scholars presume that Cassian was closer to the event and may be the more dependable reporter...\" \n\n"}

She was a member of Cumann na mBan and the honorary secretary of the executive committee. She took part in 1916 Easter Rising and War of Independence.\n\nBorn Mary Josephine Ryan in Tomcoole, near Taghmon in County Wexford to John Ryan and Eliza Sutton. She was better known as Min to her friends. She was educated in both the Loreto Abbey in Gorey and Dublin, and attended boarding school in Thurles called The Ursuline. After leaving secondary level education, she attended the Royal University of Ireland, taking English, German and French, graduating in 1908 from the National University having spent some time in both France and Germany. Ryan was a teacher in Germany for two years and taught English, she then taught in London for a further four years. After they graduated, each of Ryan's sisters taught English in Germany or France. As they were all in different countries, the sisters used a different method of communication. They sent around a large notebook, each sister contributed to the notebook by writing a letter. The notebook ended up being a great method of communication between the Ryan sisters. The book travelled around Europe. While Ryan was in London, she stayed in contact with the Irish Nationalist diaspora. Following the end of World War I, Ryan returned to Ireland.\n\nBefore she married her husband, she lived with her sister for a few years in Ranelagh. \nRyan was an intelligent and practical woman and very popular with her many nephews and nieces and other young friends. She was happiest when she was planning, when she and her sisters met together they were full of ideas and notions for themselves, their husbands and their children. She was a very attractive woman with a strong interest in current affairs although not with a great insight into the subtleties of politics and the struggle for national independence. \nShe was at her best at family and social gatherings. All twelve children from the Ryan family had secondary education and eleven out of the twelve went on to the old Catholic University or to University College Dublin. Ryan was one of the last students to attend the institution. Her family was very much a nationalist house with several of her 11 siblings involved in the Easter Rising and subsequent wars. Her brother James went on to become a politician while two of her sisters, Mary Kate and Phyllis were married to Seán T. O'Kelly, second President of Ireland. \n\nShe met Seán Mac Diarmada, the man who became one of the leaders of the Easter Rising, while she was in college but after her graduation she moved to London to attend the London University and gain her teacher certification. In 1914 she founded the local Cumann na mBan branch there. In 1915 she returned to Dublin to teach German at the Rathmines Technical School. Mac Diarmada asked her to go to Germany because of her facilitation with the language but on her sisters advice she didn't go. Joseph Plunkett was sent instead.\n\nRyan was engaged to Seán Mac Diarmada, he described her as the woman he would have married had he lived. She was one of the last people to visit him before he was executed by the British after the Rising.\n\nEarly in the morning before Sean McDermott was executed, she outlined her visit in an article with her sister Phyllis to him. Ryan was present at the house where some of the leaders of the planned insurrection met and it was decided, by them, to call off the event for Easter 1916. Ryan was sent to Wexford by Eoin MacNeill with the message that there would be no Rising. She delivered the message but hoping that in fact the rising would still take place she told the men in Wexford her opinion and returned to Dublin to see what would happen. Despite being involved with one of the leaders of the Rising, Ryan was unaware of the plans. Only that she could tell something was to happen and that her fiancée was extremely busy and stressed.\n\nDuring the Rising itself Ryan was used to transport messages to the wives of three captured British officers and to other members of the rebellion. She witnessed O'Rahilly giving orders to treat the captives in the GPO with dignity and fairness. The prisoners themselves confirmed this later telling how he had ensured their good treatment and safety.\nAfter the surrender Ryan was not arrested as she wasn't present in any of the locations, she had returned home when a sniper had shot a dog in front of her while she was headed back to the GPO and passing in front of the College of Surgeons. She and Louise Gavan Duffy went to Jacob's Factory on the Sunday morning to witness the final surrender of the men there. Again, none of the women in that location were arrested. The British officer on the site wasn't interested in the women.\n\nA conversation was recorded on RTE for the fiftieth anniversary of the Rising between Ryan and Mulcahy. The conversation entails Ryan's encounters and experiences in the week of the Rising. This all happened before Ryan had met her husband. After this a discussion about Easter week occurred which gave a good understanding of the week which was experienced by Ryan. Her experiences gave more of a romantic view of the Rising.\n\nRyan was sent to America to give John Devoy a first hand account of the Rising. Ryan married General Richard Mulcahy on 2 June 1919 in Dublin. They had six children, Padraic, Seán, Risteárd, Elizabeth, Neillí, and Maura. At the beginning of their marriage they lived in a flat which was regularly raided by the British military, Ryan had her first child there. During the War of Independence her husband spend a significant amount of time on the run and the family lived in the old buildings used by Pearce for St Enda's School. Eventually his mother asked them to leave as the frequent Black and Tan raids on them were causing damage to the house. In September 1920 where she stayed with her sister, Agnes, in Belfast for some months. After Michael Collins' death, they moved to Lissenfield House, next to Portobello barracks because Collins had held meetings in several of their previous addresses and it wasn't considered safe to remain there. Mulcahy took over leadership of the Army at that time. Mulcahy was later the become commander-in-chief of the Irish Army and leader of Fine Gael 1944-48.\n\nThere were many times throughout Ryan's life that she was up rooted by the raids carried out by the Black and Tans. Due to the fact that her husband was constantly fleeing and could only visit her in secret, it was a very difficult time in her life. In September 1920, due to the many difficulties there were in Dublin at this time, Ryan moved to Belfast for a few months to live with her sister. \n\nThe Northern Ireland Cumann na Saoirse was a brief organisation that was to represent the small group of pro-treaty within Cumann na mBan.\n\nRyan was acknowledged in the Wounded Soldiers’ Comforts fund after the civil war. She worked alongside her sister Phyllis for the Army Benevolent Fund, even though they were on opposite wars during the civil war. Ryan was a treasurer of the ladies committee of the 43rd Battalion, which was chaired by Kathleen Lemass. The committee knitted pullovers and socks for the local Defence Force. She was said to be a possible candidate for Seanad Éireann in 1925. She did some fundraising for the Cental Catholic library by organising bridge tournaments. She also helped with fundraising for the building of a new Catholic church in Cabra. She was the president of the Loreto past pupils union. She was also a part of the fund raising committee for Meath Hospital.\nMary and her family remained in residence in Portobello until 1966, where they brought up six of their children, three sons and three daughters. With the use of her managerial skills she managed to maintain a well-operating household, with the help of servants. On the few acres that were attached to the house they kept fowl and dairy cattle and grew fruits and vegetables. Later in her life Ryan took up gardening and golf as hobbies.\n\nMulcahy died at the age of 85 in 1971. After his death, Ryan lived with another woman from Wexford named Maggie in her son Seán's house. Although Ryan maintained good physical health during her last few years of life, the clarity of her mind and the integrity of her personality began to deteriorate. Eventually, Ryan was admitted to Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross in Dublin due to her battle with dementia. Ryan died there a few days later on 11 April 1977 at the age of 92.\nMr and Mrs Mulcahy were remembered by their children as a loving couple although it may not have been visible to the public eye.\n\n\n"}

Its political corollary is the kabyle sovereign, various trends (autonomy, federalism, independence) with the goal: creating a Kabyle sovereign state with Kabyle as the only official language. Kabylism differs from Berberism by affirming the kabyle specific identity and its primacy over all others, including in all berber-speaking territory. The Kabylism belongs to the family of nationalism called \"liberation\", along with Catalan or Basque nationalism. Its antithesis is Algerianism , ideology that Algerians as a whole, beyond linguistic and religious differences, would form a historical nation. \n\nIt is difficult to accurately locate the origins of kabylism, however, some sources tend to confirm that the kabylism already existed in the 18th century. At that time the Brotherhood Rahmaniya qualified as defender of Kabylism.\n\n\n"}

Her work focuses on sexual politics, gender issues, aesthetics, popular culture, and pornography. She began her career as a video artist, exploring similar themes in the form of video essays. She is professor of media studies at Northwestern University in the Department of Radio-TV-Film, where she teaches filmmaking. In recent years she has become known for debating sexual harassment policies in higher education.\n\nKipnis was born in Chicago, Illinois. She earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the San Francisco Art Institute and a Master of Fine Arts from Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. She also studied at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Studio Program. She has received fellowships for her work from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Michigan Society of Fellows, and the National Endowment for the Arts. She has been assistant professor, associate professor, and is now full professor at Northwestern University.\n\nIn her 2003 book \"Against Love: A Polemic\", a \"ragingly witty yet contemplative look at the discontents of domestic and erotic relationships, Kipnis combines portions of the slashing sexual contrarianism of Mailer, the scathing antidomestic wit of early Roseanne Barr and the coolly analytical aesthetics of early Sontag.\"\n\nIn 2010 she published \"How to Become a Scandal: Adventures in Bad Behavior\", which focused on scandal, including those of Eliot Spitzer, Linda Tripp, James Frey, Sol Wachtler, and Lisa Nowak; the book examined \"the elaborate ways those transgressors reassure themselves that they are not bringing colossal ruin upon themselves, that their dalliances will never see the light of day\". \"What allows for scandal in Kipnis's schema is every individual's blind spot, \"a little existential joke on humankind (or in some cases, a ticking time bomb) nestled at the core of every lonely consciousness...Ostensibly about scandal, her book is most memorable as a convincing case for the ultimate unknowability of the self\".\n\nHer essays and reviews have appeared in \"Slate\", \"Harper's\", \"Playboy\", \"The New York Times\", \"The New York Review of Books\", \"The Atlantic\", and \"Bookforum\".\n\nIn March 2015, after Northwestern University professor Peter Ludlow had been accused of sexual harassment, Kipnis wrote an essay in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" in which she decried \"sexual paranoia\" on campuses and discussed professor-student sexual relationships and trigger warnings. A group of students at Northwestern protested Kipnis's piece, demanding that the administration reaffirm its commitment to the sexual harassment policies that Kipnis criticized. In an opinion column for \"The Wall Street Journal\", Northwestern University president Morton O. Schapiro referred to the protest and argued for maximum speech in such conflicted situations. Two students \"took issue with the piece, saying Kipnis was describing a real-life scenario and that her facts were off. They accused Kipnis of retaliatory behavior and creating a hostile environment\". They filed a complaint with Northwestern's Title IX office, arguing that her essay had a \"chilling effect\" on students' ability to report sexual harassment. The school opened an investigation into the case. Kipnis discussed the charges and details of the investigation of those complaints in an essay titled \"My Title IX Inquisition,\" noting that her faculty support person had also been brought up on Title IX complaints over public statements about her case. Northwestern eventually exonerated her. Title IX complaints were also filed against Northwestern's President Schapiro over his \"Wall Street Journal\" column.\n\nKipnis's 2017 book, \"\" discusses the Ludlow case and argues that sexual harassment policies do not empower women and impede the fight for gender equality. One of the students who had brought the Title IX complaints against Ludlow initiated a lawsuit naming Kipnis and her publisher, HarperCollins, and alleging invasion of privacy, defamation, and other charges relating to the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "80020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80020", "title": "Manu Chao", "text": "Manu Chao\n\nManu Chao (; born José-Manuel Thomas Arthur Chao, June 21, 1961) is a French musician of Spanish descent. He sings in French, Spanish, English, Italian, Arabic, Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, Greek and occasionally in other languages. Chao began his musical career in Paris, busking and playing with groups such as Hot Pants and Los Carayos, which combined a variety of languages and musical styles. With friends and his brother Antoine Chao, he founded the band Mano Negra in 1987, achieving considerable success, particularly in Europe. He became a solo artist after its breakup in 1995, and since then tours regularly with his live band, Radio Bemba.\n\nChao's mother, Felisa Ortega, is from Bilbao, Basque Country, and his father, writer and journalist Ramón Chao, is from Vilalba, Galicia. They emigrated to Paris to avoid Francisco Franco's dictatorship—Manu's grandfather had been sentenced to death. Shortly after Manu's birth, the Chao family moved to the outskirts of Paris, and Manu spent most of his childhood in Boulogne-Billancourt and Sèvres. As he grew up he was surrounded by many artists and intellectuals, most of whom were acquaintances of his father. Chao cites much of his childhood experience as inspiration for some songs. As a child, he was a big fan of Cuban singer-pianist Bola de Nieve.\n\nHeavily influenced by the UK rock scene, particularly The Clash, The Jam and Dr. Feelgood, Chao and other musicians formed the Spanish/English rockabilly group Hot Pants in the mid-1980s. The group released a demo entitled \"Mala Vida\" in 1984, which received plenty of local critical praise but otherwise gained them little attention. By the time the group released their first album in 1986 the Parisian alternative music scene had taken flight, and Manu, his brother Antoine Chao, and friends such as Alain from Les Wampas formed Los Carayos to incorporate this sound with the rockabilly and punk styles of Hot Pants. Los Carayos remained a side project of the artists for eight years, releasing three albums in the first two years followed by a final album in 1994.\n\nIn 1987, the Chao brothers and their cousin Santiago Casariego founded the band Mano Negra. Manu Chao said in Alt.Latino in 2011, \"Mano Negra started playing in a subway in Paris before the band started to be known and selling records. We started in a subway for a living. This is what made the musicians of Mano Negra. And so the people using the subway in Paris was very eclectic. There was people from a lot of different countries, different cultures. So we have to be able to play all kind of music to please all the people in a subway. So that was a perfect school to learn a lot of different styles of music.\" Starting on a smaller label, the group released a reworked version of the Hot Pants single \"Mala Vida\" in 1988, which quickly became a hit in France. The group soon moved to Virgin Records, and their first album \"Patchanka\" was released the following year. Though the group never gained much fame in the English-speaking market, popularity throughout the rest of the world soon followed, reaching the Top 5 in the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. The band achieved some fame in South America with 1992's Cargo Tour, where it played a series of shows in port cities, performing from a stage built into their tour ship's hold. Mano Negra also performed a tour through much of Colombia in a retired train, the \"Ice Express\". Still, rifts began to grow among band members during the port tour and the following year's train tour; many band members, including Manu's brother Antoine, had left the group by the end of 1994. Following that year's release of their final album, \"Casa Babylon,\" Manu Chao moved the band to Madrid, but legal problems with former bandmates led Chao to disband the group in 1995.\n\nMano Negra's sound is mostly characterized by energetic, lively rhythms, symbolized by the title of their first album, \"Patchanka\", derived from the word \"pachanga\" (which is a colloquial term for \"party\"), and a distinct informality which allows the audience to get involved and feel close to their sound. Mixed music genres are present throughout their albums. Manu Chao is friends with Gogol Bordello and that group has covered Mano Negra's song \"Mala Vida\" on their own and with Chao beginning in 2006.\n\nAfter arriving in Madrid, Chao and other bandmates from Mano Negra formed a new group, Radio Bemba Sound System (named for the communication system used in the Sierra Maestra by the Castro-and-Guevara-led rebels in the Cuban Revolution), featuring groups from diverse backgrounds, such as Mexican Tijuana No!, Brazilian Skank, and Argentinian Todos Tus Muertos. The goal was to replicate the sound of street music and bar scenes from a variety of cultures; to that end, Chao and the group spent several years travelling throughout South and Central America, recording new music as they went. The resulting music differed drastically from Mano Negra; the songs were primarily sung in Spanish with far fewer French tracks and the musical style had shifted from punk and alternative styles to the street vibe Chao was aiming for. The songs were collectively released as \"Clandestino\" in 1998, under Manu Chao's own name. Though not an instant success, the album gained a steady following in France with hits such as \"Bongo Bong\" and \"Clandestino\", and the album eventually earned the Best World Music Album award in 1999's Victoires de la Musique awards. It sold in excess of 5 million copies.\n\nChao's second album with Radio Bemba Sound System, \",\" was released in 2001. This album, named after one of the Madrid metro station stops (the title translates to \"next station: Hope\"), features similar sounds to \"Clandestino\" but with heavier Caribbean influences than the previous album. The album was an instant hit, leading to a successful tour that resulted in the 2002 live album \"Radio Bemba Sound System.\" Two years later, Chao returned to his French roots with the French-only album \"Sibérie m'était contée,\" which included a large book featuring lyrics to the album and illustrations by Jacek Woźniak.\n\nManu Chao's next album \"La Radiolina\" (literally \"little radio\" in Italian, but also \"pocket radio\") was released on September 17, 2007. This was the first international release since 2001's \"Próxima Estación: Esperanza\". \"Rainin in Paradize\" was the first single from the album, available for download on his website before the release of the album. Concert reviews indicate that music from \"La Radiolina\" was already being performed live as early as April 2007's Coachella show.\n\nIn 2003 he approached Amadou & Mariam and later produced their 2004 album \"Dimanche à Bamako\" (\"Sunday in Bamako\"). His song \"Me llaman Calle\", written for the 2005 Spanish film \"Princesas\", earned that film a Goya nomination for Best Original Song. It has been released in 2007's \"La Radiolina\". Vocals from the song are included in the Go Lem System song \"Calle Go Lem\". \"Time\" magazine named \"Me Llaman Calle\" one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at No. 8. Writer Josh Tyrangiel observed, Chao's warm singing over José Manuel Gamboa and Carlos Herrero's leaping Flamenco counter melody creates a direct emotional line to the core of this mid-tempo ballad. With its easy melody and universal rhythm Me Llaman Calle walks proudly in the shadow of Bob Marley, the last guy who made world music this disarmingly simple.Manu Chao was featured on the album \"True Love\" by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.\n\nHis song \"La Vida Tómbola\" was featured in the documentary film \"Maradona\" by Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica. The song \"La Trampa\", recorded with Tonino Carotone for the compilation album \"Fuerza!\" was used as the theme song for the short-lived improvisational comedy \"Drew Carey's Green Screen Show\".\n\nThe songs \"Bongo Bong\" and \"Je ne t'aime plus\", which appear back-to-back on \"Clandestino\", were covered by British singers Robbie Williams and Lily Allen, who recorded them as a single track, \"Bongo Bong and Je Ne T'aime Plus\" and released it as a single from the album \"Rudebox\".\n\nManu Chao sings in Spanish, French, English, Portuguese, Galician, Arabic and Wolof, often mixing several languages in the same song. His music has many influences, such as punk, rock, French \"chanson\", Iberoamerican salsa, reggae, ska, and Algerian raï. These influences were obtained from immigrants in France, his Iberian connections, and foremost his travels in Mesoamerica as a nomad following the disbanding of Mano Negra. While Mano Negra called their style \"patchanka\" (literally \"patchwork\"), Manu Chao speaks of \"música mestiza\" (), a musical style which may also incorporate elements of rap, flamenco, Afro-Cuban music, samba and cumbia.\n\nIn many of his pieces he layers lyrics, music, and sound recordings over each other. In the short documentary film \"Infinita tristeza\" (essentially a video travelogue of Chao's 2001 tour of South America), included within the bonus section of his 2002 live DVD release \"Babylonia en Guagua\", Chao explained that his only recording tool is a small IBM (later Lenovo) ThinkPad laptop computer, which he carries with him wherever he goes; he has occasionally used conventional recording studios, such as Europa Sonor in Paris, to overdub instruments such as drums, electric guitars and brass, but the vast majority of his material (including all sorts of spoken-word samples from radio stations, TV, films, old vinyl records and, on \"\", announcements from the Madrid Metro) has been recorded by Chao himself exclusively on his laptop. The Spanish credit \"Grabado en el Estudio Clandestino\" (\"Recorded in Studio Clandestino/Clandestine Studio\"), which appears on all of his solo album starting from 1998's Clandestino, actually refers to the laptop. \n\nChao also has a tendency to reuse music or lyrics from previous songs to form new songs. The contemporary hit single in France \"Bongo Bong\", takes its lyrics from the earlier Mano Negra hit \"King of Bongo\", which bears a similar style to that of The Clash. The musical backdrop for \"Bongo Bong\", in turn, was used in several other Chao songs, including \"Je Ne T'Aime Plus\" from the same album and \"Mr. Bobby\" and \"Homens\" from \"\". (According to a statement by Chao himself in the \"Próxima Estación\" CD booklet, \"Homens\" is the song which the backdrop was originally written and recorded for, and all the others came later.) Also, the tune of \"La Primavera\", a track from that same album, is used in several other songs featured on the LP, while lyrics for a few songs on \"Sibérie m'était contée\" are repeated several times with different music, leading the lyrics to be interpreted in various ways depending on the mood of the track. Several musical themes and clips from that album also appear on Amadou & Mariam's Chao-produced \"Dimanche à Bamako\", which were being produced at approximately the same time.\n\nThough Chao is quite well known in Europe and Latin America, he has not had the same success in the English-speaking world. Tours in the United States with Mano Negra were not as successful as elsewhere and Chao seems inclined to focus his efforts in the places where his musical style finds its roots. Though his live performances in the U.S. are infrequent, Chao played a handful of dates there in 2006, including a headlining show at Lollapalooza 2006 in Chicago, IL. His final appearance on his 2006 U.S. tour was a benefit concert in the Prospect Park bandshell in Brooklyn, New York on August 7. He returned to that venue in the summer of 2007 for two concerts, part of the multicultural \"Celebrate Brooklyn\" concert series. The crowd was treated to a nearly two-hour performance, including two encores. Manu Chao also appeared at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland to a sellout crowd on June 23, 2007. This was a semi-spontaneous endeavour between Thievery Corporation and Manu Chao facilitated by a new-found friendship developed during Lollapalooza 2006. He was one of the headlining acts at the 2008 Austin City Limits Music Festival and the Outside Lands Music Festival in Golden Gate Park. In January 2012 he was the headline act at the opening night of Sydney Festival, marking his first concert in Australia.\n\nChao believes that our world lacks spaces for \"collective therapy\" and describes his concerts as small temporary spaces where people of different backgrounds can come together \n\nChao's lyrics provoke his audience to think about immigration, love, living in ghettos, drugs, and often carry a left-wing message. This reflects Chao's own political leanings—he is very close to the Zapatistas and their public spokesman, Subcomandante Marcos. He has many followers among the European left, the Latin American left and the anti-globalisation and anti-free trade movements. Chao is a founding member of ATTAC. Punk and reggae historian Vivien Goldman commented of his work, \"I was writing about Good Charlotte and The Police. They adopted the trappings of punk. They aren’t bad groups, but the punk aspect is more manifested by somebody like Manu Chao. He's one of the punkiest artists out there I can think of. It's an inclusionary spirit that is punk.\"\n\nChao uses his Facebook and Twitter accounts to show support to many causes and current movements including Anti Globalization, Indigenous Peoples' Rights, Sex Workers' Rights, Women's Rights, Environmental Justice, and more. He also uses his personal website to provide news on events related to these causes and movements.\n\nSince 1991, Chao has been working with La Colifata, which is an NGO made up of a group of patients and ex patients of Hospital Borda, a psychiatric hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Chao uses both a website and a Facebook account to show the work he does with these patients and ex patients. On their Facebook page he explains that the mission of this group is to diminish the stigma that people place on mental illness and to promote the use of services that are meant to help those with mental illnesses.\n\nIn an interview with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is one reason that he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.\n\nIn this interview he also expressed his belief that currently, the global market is the largest force shaping the lives of people throughout the world. For this reason, he believes that the most effective way to solve social problems in individual countries is to address them at a global level by changing the policies dictating the global market. He explained that since most people are not given the power to directly change these policies, the most effective way to bring about change would be to make a statement to those running the economy by becoming self-sufficient through boycotting corporations, growing one's own vegetables, and making one's own clothes.\n\nHe then added that he does not own a car or cell phone because he does not need either of these. He also talked about having weak leaders as a threat to democracy and explained that there are small movements in Spain that are fighting for blank votes to be recorded as legitimate votes. He explained this could be a solution because blank votes currently make up a majority of the votes in elections, which means that election results are inaccurate.\n\nAnother topic he discussed during this interview was education. He expressed his belief that education is important and should be free for everyone. He mentioned that Cuba is able to provide free education for all those living in Cuba despite being a small country and that he doesn't understand how the United States being such a powerful nation was not able to do the same. He then expressed frustration at the fact that one can enroll in the armed forces in the United States and \"learn to kill\" for free, but had to pay to learn to do anything else. He suggested that this is a sign that the United States is afraid of its future.\n\nWhen asked about immigration during this interview, Chao mentioned that the West, particularly the United States, has a population with a lot of elderly people and that in order to excel in the future, the West needs the youth from \"Third World\" countries. He explains that providing legal status to immigrant young people would require the United States to honor the rights of these immigrants, and therefore it is cheaper and easier for the United States to deny so many young immigrants a legal status. He then said that the \"Occident...needs to open the borders.\"\n\nIn an article published in 2010, Cornelia Gräbner mentioned Chao's lyrics in a discussion about how the work of four different authors who contribute to the alter-globalization movement. Gräbner discusses how Manu Chao, Eduardo Galeano, Subcomandante Marcos, and José Saramago present alternative practice of politics from different perspectives. Gräbner states that Chao's work emphasizes the connection of contemporary ‘rebellious Europe’ with past struggles, particularly through his lyrics and combinations of musical styles. Gräbner believes that Chao's family history plays a crucial role in his political views and how that has shaped the way he creates his music. She explains that \"Chao translates his family’s anti-fascist political tradition into a politicized embrace of cultural difference and into a clear anti-racist and anticapitalist stance.\" She also states that in the 1900s Mano Negra took an anticapitalist and anti-racist stance, and that Chao continue to use these messages in his music even after the dissolution of Mano Negra.\n\n\n\n\n-extracts : \"El viento\", Tijuana, 2000\n\n-extracts : \"El viento\", live à La Cigale, Paris, France, 2001\n\n-extracts : \"Machine gun\", Paris, France 2001\n\n\n-extracts: live Marseille, France, 2002\n\n-extracts : festival Son Latinos, Tenerife, Spain, 2003\n\n-extracts : \"mr bobby\", \"welcome to tijuana\" live Colmar, France 2003\n-extracts : \"Mr Bobby\", Werchter, Belgium 2006\n\n-extracts : \"la vida tombola\", Paléo Festival Nyon, Switzerland 2008\n\n\n-extracts : \"Romerito verde\", Perm, Russia 2011\n\n-extracts : \"Mr Bobby\", \"dia luna dia pena\" , Paléo Festival Nyon, Switzerland 2012\n\n-extracts : live Bogota, Colombia 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He debuted in a series of Flash animations (mostly without any dialogue, although the occasional word of Korean or English is present) on the internet. Mashimaro is far more often seen in merchandise, similar to Hello Kitty. (Mashimaro would in fact be best described as Korea's answer to Sanrio.) Mashimaro merchandise can be found on the internet and in Korean communities around the world.\n\nThe original Mashimaro cartoons are full of toilet humour, and some of this is also to be found in the merchandise. Mashimaro himself is often portrayed with a plunger stuck to his head. In contrast to other hyper-cute iconic characters, such as Hello Kitty, Mashimaro is portrayed as an obese and obnoxious bully, often resorts to violence to impose his will on others.\n\nAt the first born of this character, directors decided to disuse it because they thought 'cartoon characters must have big eyes and positive attitudes'. But Mashimaro has razor thin eyes and he a too pessimistic attitude. So the creator Kim Jae made a series of flash animations on the Internet cartoon site and people loved it. Also directors changed their mind about Mashimaro and it became the first Korean hit character. After some years later, there came the company to professionally market this character.\n\nMashimaro also has a look-alike, Chocomaro, who is brown. Chocomaro appears in two parodies of \"Mashimaro\" Episodes, including Episodes 2 and 3. Chocomaro tries to do what Mashimaro would normally do in these episodes, but always messes them up and ends up gets hurt. It is unknown exactly what relationship Chocomaro shares with Mashimaro, but most believe that he is the brother of Mashimaro.\n\nThe name \"Mashimaro\" came from the creator's niece/nephew mispronouncing the word \"marshmallow\" and this character was modeled on the creator's nephew.\n\n\n"}

She was a Christian missionary in China for 28 years. She is known for the care and protection of as many as ten thousand Chinese refugees during the Nanking Massacre in China, at times even challenging the Japanese authorities for documents in an attempt to protect the civilians staying at her college.\n\nAfter persisting in the Nanking Safety Zone from 1937, she returned to the United States under extreme stress in 1940. She committed suicide there in 1941, still wishing in her diary that she could return to her work in China. Vautrin was posthumously awarded the Emblem of the Blue Jade by the Chinese government for her sacrifices during the Nanjing Massacre.\n\nWilhelmina Vautrin was born in Secor, Illinois on September 27, 1886 to Pauline (née Lohr) and Edmond Louis Vautrin. Her father, Edmond, a French immigrant from Lorraine, moved to Peoria, Illinois in 1883 to undergo a blacksmithing apprenticeship with his uncle, and later moved to Secor, where he married Pauline. Minnie was the second of the couple's three children; her elder brother died as an infant.\n\nWhen Minnie was six years old, her mother died of unrecorded causes. After this, Minnie was sent to several different foster homes. Three years later, the courts permitted her to return home to her father, where she assumed many household chores and excelled in school. Her teacher, commending Vautrin's work at school, later said that \"Minnie was a born student...She could excel in most anything she tried, and was a genuinely Christian girl.\" After primary schooling, Vautrin attended Secor High School. During her high school career, Vautrin worked several part-time jobs to save for her schooling and volunteered at local churches.\n\nVautrin was accepted to Illinois State Normal University in Normal, Illinois in 1903. Due to her financial situation, Vautrin had to delay her studies several times to work. When she graduated in 1907, she was ranked first in her class of 93 students and spoke at the commencement ceremonies. She taught mathematics at LeRoy High School, Illinois before continuing her studies at the University of Illinois. At the University, Vautrin was president of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. She graduated in 1912 as salutatorian of her class with a A.B. in science. The university pastor recommended Vautrin to the recruiters of the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, who requested that she replace a teacher in China. Iris Chang notes that Vautrin was \"Tall and Handsome in her youth, with long dark hair, she was a vivacious and popular woman who attracted numerous suitors,\" but who decided that instead of getting married she would become a missionary.\n\nWhen Vautrin received this request \"circa\" 1912, Christian missions to China, facilitated by groups such as the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, had begun to flourish as a result of the treaties ending the First Opium War (1840–42) and Second Opium War (1863-65) that opened Chinese seaports to Christianity. Hua-ling Hu, one of Vautrin's biographers and writer of \" American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin\", writes that \"by 1914, about six thousand young Americans went to foreign countries as missionaries, over one-third of them to China.\" Vautrin accepted the Foreign Christian Missionary Society's request to develop a girls' school in China, and when she was 26 years old, she traveled to Hofei to establish the San Ching Girls' Middle School. During her time at the school the number of pupils increased and a high school department was added. In Hofei, Vautrin also met her future fiancé, a fellow American missionary whose name is unknown.\n\nIn 1918, after serving for a period of six years in China, Minnie returned to the United States for furlough. She enrolled in Columbia University in New York City to pursue a master's degree in education, which she received in 1919. While at Columbia University, Vautrin was approached by a teacher from Ginling College, and was asked to serve as president of the institution for one year. The College was the third institution founded by a group of American missionaries who sought to \"establish four woman's colleges in China – one each in north, central, west, and south.\" Vautrin postponed her wedding for one year in order to become the acting president at Ginling College in 1919. However, she later broke off her engagement and never married.\n\nAt Ginling College, Vautrin decided to extend her one-year agreement. She created courses on education administration and management, an innovative student-teaching program, and handled the planning and funding of the new campus by the West Gate of Nanking. During the fall semester of 1922, Vautrin hosted a fundraiser to build an elementary school for 150 local, mostly illiterate children who lived in the homes near Ginling College's campus. The biographer Hua-ling Hu writes that, while at Ginling College, Minnie \"attempted to lead the students to fulfill the spirit of Ginling's motto, 'abundant life,' by making them walk out of the 'ivory tower' to see and understand the suffering of the poor and by encouraging them to devote their lives for the betterment of the society.\" However, some of the College's staff members and students did not support Vautrin's method, who found her overbearing, conservative, and self-righteous. This may be due to her \"watchful and interfering administrative style.\"\n\nIn 1926, after Vautrin returned from a brief visit to her family in America, the Nationalist government's Northern Expedition troops under General Chiang Kai-Shek captured Nanking. While in Nanking, the army perpetrated the Nanking Incident, which involved the destruction and looting of the city and the slaughter of native citizens as well as foreigners. Ginling College was not harmed during the looting, and Vautrin hid in the College's attic with a few others while Chiang Kai-shek's troops were on Ginling's campus. The Nanking Incident deterred many American missionaries from serving in China, and many left the country.\n\nHowever, Vautrin remained at Ginling College, and served as its president until the Chinese Nationalist government mandated that all colleges in China have native-born presidents. She was replaced by a Ginling graduate, Dr. Wu Yi-fang, in September 1928. In 1931, Vautrin returned to the United States on furlough and in order to care for her aging father. She returned to Ginling in 1932. On June 21, 1937, Vautrin received word that her father, Edmond, had died at the age of 83.\n\nUpon hearing of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Vautrin cancelled her planned furlough, scheduled for 1938, and immediately returned to Nanking from Tokyo in order to protect Ginling College and its students. Vautrin prepared intensely for the approaching Japanese army. She made arrangements to prepare the campus by sending records to Shanghai, purchased supplies, instructed students and faculty on emergency precautions, cleaned out and converting rooms in campus buildings for storage and refuge, and ordered the building of trenches. The first Japanese air raid on Nanking took place on April 14, 1937. As a result of the raid, the American embassy arranged for the evacuation of Americans from the city. In her diary, Vautrin wrote that she felt compelled to stay in Nanking:\n\nI personally feel that I cannot leave... Men are not asked to leave their ships when they are in danger and women are not asked to leave their children.\n\nBy September, only three Ginling students remained on campus. Due to financial strains, the salaries of the fifteen remaining faculty members at Ginling College were halved. Anticipating a direct Japanese assault on the city, the foreigners who chose to stay in Nanking organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone (ICNSZ) on November 15, 1937. The committee requested that the Japanese and Chinese governments treat a refugee zone of Nanking as neutral, and both nations agreed and granted the ICNSZ neutrality. The Japanese placed one condition on the neutrality, requiring that the neutral zone would be made void if Chinese military personnel were found hiding within it.\n\nIn the first few nights of the Japanese attack on the city, 850 refugees came to Ginling College, which was designated as one of the twenty-five refugee camps in Nanking. When the Imperial Japanese Army took complete control of Nanking in December 1937, she and other foreign nationals, including John Rabe, worked to protect civilians in the Nanking Safety Zone. Ginling College took up its full role as a refugee haven, at times harboring up to 10,000 women in buildings designed to support between 200 and 300. During this period, Vautrin wrote fairly frequently in her diary. One of her entries was a prayer:\n\nOh, God, control the cruel beastliness of the soldiers in Nanking tonight, comfort the heartbroken mothers and fathers whose innocent sons have been shot today, and guard the young women and girls through the long agonizing hours of this night. Speed the day when wars shall be no more. When thy Kingdom will come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\n\nWhen all other refugee camps closed on February 4, 1938, a large number of women and children again sought refuge at the College and a census in mid-March showed 3,310 refugees were resident there. Vautrin would patrol the campus grounds and repel incursions of Japanese soldiers into the College and rescue and care for refugees. She saw to the burial of the dead and the reception of newborn babies and was successful in tracing missing husbands and sons. Industrial or crafts classes were provided for women who had lost their husbands, so that they might support themselves. One hundred women graduated under this program.\n\nVautrin recounted the war in her diary in 1937:\n\nThere probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today. Thirty girls were taken from language school last night, and today I have heard scores of heartbreaking stories of girls who were taken from their homes last night—one of the girls was but 12 years old. Food, bedding and money have been taken from people. … I suspect every house in the city has been opened, again and yet again, and robbed. Tonight a truck passed in which there were eight or ten girls, and as it passed they called out \"救命！救命！ Jiuming! Jiuming!\"—save our lives. The occasional shots that we hear out on the hills, or on the street, make us realize the sad fate of some man—very probably not a soldier.\n\nOn 19 December:\n\nIn my wrath, I wished I had the power to smite them for their dastardly work. How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror.\n\nIn 1938, she wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at Ginling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away.\nNear the end of her service at Ginling College, Vautrin wrote several entries that lacked her previous determination and optimism. Among these was April 14, 1940:\n\nI'm about at the end of my energy. Can no longer forge ahead and make plans for the work, for on every hand there seems to be obstacles of some kind.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, suffering from severe stress probably due to worry about the fate of Ginling College and its students, Vautrin was accompanied back to the United States by a colleague. After attempting to commit suicide using sleeping pills, Vautrin appeared to recover for a short while. However, she later committed suicide by turning on the stove gas in her apartment in Indianapolis. She was 54 years old. One entry in her journal, recorded shortly before her death, displays her devotion to Ginling College and the people of China, whom she served for 28 years as a Christian missionary:\n\nHad I ten perfect lives, I would give them all to China.\n\nAfter the war, Vautrin was posthumously awarded the Emblem of the Blue Jade by the Chinese government for her sacrifices during the Nanjing Massacre. Her work saving the lives of Chinese civilians during the massacre is recounted in the biographical book, \"American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking\", written by historian Hu, Hua-Ling. In the 2007 documentary film \"Nanking\", Vautrin was portrayed by actress Mariel Hemingway, who recited excerpts from Vautrin's diary.\n\nThe Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall is a museum built by the Nanjing Municipal Government to memorialize the 300,000 victims of the Nanjing massacre, the survivors, and those who tried to protect the people of Nanjing during the atrocity. In the museum, there is a memorial to Minnie Vautrin. Additionally, there is a statue of Vautrin in Jinling Women's College, among memorials to the other non-Chinese individuals who helped to protect the College and its inhabitants during the Nanjing massacre.\n\nThe hardcore band Hiretsukan honors Wilhelmina Vautrin in their song \"Song For Wilhelmina Vautrin\" on their 2005 record \"End States\".\n\nShe is depicted in Lu Chuan's 2009 film \"City of Life and Death\". In the 2009 movie on John Rabe, Minnie Vautrin is replaced by a fictive Valérie Dupres of an \"International Girls College\" as an important fellow Nanking Safety Zone committee member. In \"Nanjing Requiem\", a 2011 novel by Chinese-born writer and Boston University professor Ha Jin, Ha writes from the perspective of a fictionalized assistant to Vautrin named Anling Gao.\n\n\n\nNovels about the Nanking Massacre, inspired by or featuring Vautrin:\n\n"}

He's also known for designing computer systems that can be operated in the Nepali language.\n\nBorn in 1942, in Patan, Sakya was interested in science and technology from childhood. On the list of boyhood achievements is a radio receiver set that he designed and fabricated to listen to Radio Nepal. To satisfy his keen interest in electronics, he opted for engineering, and after obtaining his diploma in radio engineering from Calcutta, India in 1962, he joined Radio Nepal as a technician.\n\nIn 1970, Muni went to the UK on a British Council scholarship and obtained a degree in computer engineering. After his return from the UK, he designed and fabricated several devices; a laboratory type stabilized power supply and a sine wave generator. Muni went to France in 1973, where he worked from until 1979. It was in France that he decided to switch to the field of computers. He made microprocessor-based controllers and video cards while doing a course in communication, digital electronics and computer techniques there.\n\nIn 1979, he made the first microcomputer in Nepal. For this, he made the power supply unit and video card himself. He bought a keyboard from the US and made the monitor from a Russian television. At the South Asian Regional Conference on computers, held in Kathmandu in 1979, Sakya demonstrated his microcomputer.\n\nSakya went to the US in 1981. He worked in developing floppy disk controllers with 900Kb (quad density) storage space. As there were no I/O cards, after he came back from the US, he made I/O cards required for the hard disk. He also designed microprocessor-based traffic controllers in Kathmandu. Back in his own country, he opened the first company for manufacturing computer cards, Sun Moon Computer Industry, in 1995, and also established Hi-Tech Pioneer Ltd, an Internet Service Provider.\n\nSakya’s primary interest is in designing systems that can be operated in the Nepali language. It is not easy to program in the Nepali language. Because of the difficulty in programming, computing in Nepalese was limited to word processing. He did his first demonstration of computing in the Nepali language on a microcomputer with the display of Nepalese National Anthem in Devanagari script in 1983 on a CP/M-based computer. He received the Science Award in December 1983 for this work. He also developed a software package complete with all Nepali characters. Certificates and checks were printed in the Nepali language using it. Now professional Nepali packages can be developed in the Nepali language. Sakya is still working towards computing with Nepali menus and commands so that people can work with computers without the knowledge of English.\n\nMuni Sakya has been experimenting on robotics for a number of years. Around 2004-2005, he developed a robot (known as the \"Munis Robot\") that can speak Nepali with the capability to discern obstacles by the help of built-in ultrasonic, infra red, mechanical whiskers, and other visual and audio devices. \n\nIn 2005, the Royal Nepal Academy of Science & Technology (RONAST) conferred Muni B. Sakya with felicitations and a cash award of Rs. 50,000 as an A class scientist in the field of information technology.\n\nOn May 17, 2006, for the first time in Nepal, Sakya's supercomputer with 16 nodes was demonstrated to the press and many other people as well. This supercomputer works on open source OS with OpenMosix and Oscar. The supercomputer that used to cost millions of dollars in the past is envisaged by utilizing sixteen computers in cluster bringing down the cost drastically for computing bigger and complex jobs with the fraction of a time that is many giga-flops per second. This computer is on display at High Tech Pioneer Pvt. Ltd, located at Kalikasthan, Dillibazar, Nepal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "306428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306428", "title": "Nestor Makhno", "text": "Nestor Makhno\n\nNestor Ivanovych Makhno or Bat'ko (\"Father\") Makhno (; October 26, 1888 (N.S. November 7) – July 25, 1934) was a Ukrainian anarcho-communist revolutionary and the commander of an independent anarchist army in Ukraine in 1917–22.\n\nAs commander of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, commonly referred to as the \"Makhnovshchina\", Makhno led a guerrilla campaign. \"Makhnovshchina\" can be loosely translated as \"Makhno movement\". The term encompasses not only the army but the whole of the movement's activities and overall spirit. The suffix -\"shchina\" can be employed in a slightly derogatory manner, but this is not the intention in this case, given that the movement's adherents – including Makhno himself – frequently used the term to describe themselves. Makhno fought all factions which sought to impose any external authority over southern Ukraine, battling in succession the Ukrainian Nationalists, the Imperial German and Austro-German occupation, the Hetmanate Republic, the Russian White Army, the Russian Red Army, and other smaller forces led by Ukrainian otamans. Makhno and his movement repeatedly attempted to reorganize life in the Huliaipole region along anarchist lines; however, the disruptions of the civil war precluded any long-term social experiments.\n\nAlthough Makhno considered the Bolsheviks a threat to the development of an anarchist Free Territory within Ukraine, he twice entered into military alliances with them to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the defeat of the White Army in the region in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno, which concluded with his escape across the Romanian border in August 1921. After a series of imprisonments and escapes, Makhno finally settled in Paris with his wife Halyna and daughter Yelena. In exile Makhno wrote three volumes of memoirs. Makhno died in exile at the age of 45 from tuberculosis-related causes. He is also credited as the inventor of the tachanka, a horse-drawn platform mounting a heavy machine gun.\n\nNestor Makhno was born into a poor peasant family in Huliaipole, Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine). He was the youngest of five children. Church files show a baptism date of October 27 (November 7), 1888; but Nestor Makhno's parents registered his date of birth as 1889 (in an attempt to postpone conscription).\n\nHis father died when he was ten months old. Due to extreme poverty, he had to work as a shepherd at the age of seven. He studied at the Second Huliaipole primary school in winter at the age of eight and worked for local landlords during the summer. He left school at the age of twelve and was employed as a farmhand on the estates of nobles and on the farms of wealthy peasants.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, he was employed in Huliaipole itself as an apprentice painter, then as a worker in a local iron foundry and ultimately as a foundryman in the same organization. During this time he became involved in revolutionary politics. His involvement was based on his experiences of injustice at work and the terrorism of the Tsarist regime during the 1905 revolution. In 1906, Makhno joined the anarchist organization in Huliaipole. He was arrested in 1906, tried, and acquitted. He was again arrested in 1907, but could not be incriminated, and the charges were dropped. The third arrest came in 1908 when an infiltrator was able to testify against Makhno. In 1910 Makhno was sentenced to death by hanging, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was sent to Butyrskaya prison in Moscow. In prison he came under the influence of his intellectual cellmate Piotr Arshinov. He was released from prison after the February Revolution in 1917.\n\nAfter liberation from prison, Makhno organized a peasants' union. It gave him a \"Robin Hood\" image and he expropriated large estates from landowners and distributed the land among the peasants.\n\nIn March 1918 the new Bolshevik government in Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk concluding peace with the Central Powers, but ceding large amounts of territory, including Ukraine. As the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) proved unable to maintain order, a coup by Pavlo Skoropadsky in April 1918 resulted in the establishment of the Hetmanate. Already dissatisfied by the UNR's failure to resolve the question of land ownership, much of the peasantry refused to support a conservative government administered by former imperial officials and supported by the Austro-Hungarian and German occupiers. Peasant bands under various self-appointed \"otamany\" which had been counted on the rolls of the UNR's army now attacked the Germans, later going over to the Directory in summer 1918 or to the Bolsheviks in late 1918–19, or home to protect local interests, in many cases changing allegiances, plundering so-called class enemies, and venting age-old resentments. They finally dominated the countryside in mid-1919; the largest portion would follow either Socialist Revolutionary Matviy Hryhoriyiv or the anarchist flag of Makhno.\n\nIn Yekaterinoslav province the rebellion soon took on anarchist political overtones. Nestor Makhno joined an anarchist group (headed by sailor-deserter Fedir Shchus) and eventually became its commander. Due in part to the impressive personality and charisma of Makhno, all Ukrainian anarchist detachments and peasant guerrilla bands in the region subsequently became known as \"Makhnovists\". These eventually came together in the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (RIAU), also called the Black Army (because they fought under the anarchist black flag). The RIAU battled against the Whites (counter-revolutionaries) forces, Ukrainian nationalists, and various independent paramilitary formations that conducted anti-semitic pogroms. The anarchist movement in Ukraine came to be referred to as the \"Black Army\", \"Makhnovism\" or pejoratively \"Makhnovshchina\".\n\nHetman Pavlo Skoropadsky, head of the Ukrainian State, lost the support of the Central Powers (Germany and Austro-Hungary, which had armed his forces and installed him in power) after the collapse of the German western front. Unpopular among most southern Ukrainians, the Hetman saw his best forces evaporate, and was driven out of Kiev by the Directory. In March 1918, Makhno's forces and allied anarchist and guerrilla groups won victories against German, Austrian, and Ukrainian nationalist (the army of Symon Petlura) forces, and units of the White Army, capturing many German and Austro-Hungarian arms. These victories over much larger enemy forces established Makhno's reputation as a military tactician; he became known as \"Batko\" (‘Father’) to his admirers.\n\nAt this point, the emphasis on military campaigns that Makhno had adopted in the previous year shifted to political concerns. The first \"Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups\", under the name of \"Nabat\" (\"the Alarm Bell Toll\"), issued five main principles: rejection of all political parties, rejection of all forms of dictatorships (including the dictatorship of the proletariat, viewed by Makhnovists and many anarchists of the day as a term synonymous with the dictatorship of the Bolshevik communist party), negation of any concept of a central state, rejection of a so-called \"transitional period\" necessitating a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat, and self-management of all workers through free local workers' councils (soviets). While the Bolsheviks argued that their concept of dictatorship of the proletariat meant precisely \"rule by workers' councils,\" the Makhnovist platform opposed the \"temporary\" Bolshevik measure of \"party dictatorship.\" The \"Nabat\" was by no means a puppet of Makhno and his supporters, from time to time criticizing the Black Army and its conduct in the war.\n\nIn 1918, after recruiting large numbers of Ukrainian peasants, as well as numbers of Jews, anarchists, \"naletchki\", and recruits arriving from other countries, Makhno formed the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, otherwise known as the Anarchist Black Army. At its formation, the Black Army consisted of about 15,000 armed troops, including infantry and cavalry (both regular and irregular) brigades; artillery detachments were incorporated into each regiment. From November 1918 to June 1919, using the Black Army to secure its hold on power, the Makhnovists attempted to create an anarchist society in Ukraine, administered at the local level by autonomous peasants' and workers' councils.\n\nMakhno called the Bolsheviks dictators and opposed the \"Cheka [secret police]... and similar compulsory authoritative and disciplinary institutions\" and called for \"[f]reedom of speech, press, assembly, unions and the like\". The Bolsheviks, in turn, accused the Makhnovists of imposing a formal government over the area they controlled, and also said that Makhnovists used forced conscription, committed summary executions, and had two military and counter-intelligence forces: the Kontrrazvedka, with punitive functions transferred in 1920 to the\nKommissiya Protivmakhnovskikh Del (Commission for Anti-Makhnovist Activities).\n\nThe Bolsheviks claimed that it would be impossible for a small, agricultural society to organize into an anarchist society so quickly. However, Eastern Ukraine had a large amount of coal mines, and was one of the most industrialised parts of the Russian Empire.\n\nAs a revolutionary peasant leader Makhno has been called a \"colourful personality\" and his career \"legendary\". However, the German and Mennonite communities in Ukraine considered him to be an instigator of paramilitary banditry against innocent farmers, and an \"inhuman monster whose path is literally drenched with blood.\" He is consistently referred to as a terrorist or bandit in Mennonite literature. At the age of 11 Makhno began working as an ox driver on the Janzen estate in Silberfeld. Here he began to develop a hatred for the ruling classes. In his memoirs he writes: \"At this time I began to experience anger, envy and even hatred towards the landowner [Janzen] and especially towards his children – those young slackers who often strolled past me sleek and healthy, well-dressed, well-groomed and scented; while I was filthy, dressed in rags, barefoot, and reeked of manure from cleaning the calves' barn.\" Makhno also worked at the Mennonite owned Kroeger plant in Gulyai-Polye.\n\nMahkno and his troops raided many German and Mennonite colonies and estates in the Katerynoslav Oblast. The larger rural landholdings of Mennonites were prominent targets due to their wealth and proximity to Gulyai-Polye. The Schönfeld colony, located adjacent to the Huliaipole area, was unique in that it consisted predominantly of Mennonite estate settlements across an expansive area. Mennonite colonies were targeted by Makhno because, as owners of prosperous farms and estates, wealthy farmers exploited the labour of the surrounding peasantry. Ukrainians were traditionally hired by wealthy Mennonites as house servants and farmhands.\n\nWhile their religious beliefs did not allow them to serve in the Tsar's army, many Mennonites had assisted the Russian war effort by performing national service in non-fighting roles, notably forestry and medical units. The Mennonites' Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment. Makhno's own brother, Emelian—a disabled war veteran—was murdered and his mother's house burned to the ground by the Germans. The Mennonites themselves, having been stripped of their wealth and property during the revolution, embraced the occupation which promised to re-establish them as landowners. Some Mennonites accompanied punitive detachments against the peasantry, which greatly contributed to the growing bitterness between Mennonites and Ukrainians. In October 1918, Austro-Hungarian forces and \"German colonists\" burned down the pro-Makhnovist village of Bolshe-Mikholaivka and murdered many of its inhabitants. Makhno responded with a sustained campaign of retribution against German/Mennonite colonies and estates. At the same time Makhno voiced his opposition to the indiscriminate slaughter of the colonists and established \"ground rules\" for occupying the colonies. Throughout 1918 a total of 96 Mennonites were killed in the Schönfeld-Brasol area. By the winter 1918–19 most residents of the Schönfeld colony had fled to the relative safety of the Molotschna colony.\n\nThe Mennonites had been encouraged to form self-defence (\"Selbstschutz\") units. Mennonite youth were trained and armed under the supervision of German officers. Breaking with nearly four centuries of pacifism, tacit approval of the \"Selbstschutz\" was given by the Mennonite leadership at the Lichtenau Conference [June 30- July 2, 1918]. Intended exclusively for the defence of the colony, with the arrival of General Denikin's White Volunteer Army the \"Selbstschutz\" was gradually drawn into offensive operations against Makhno. Later some Mennonites also formed ethnic battalions within the White Army. The \"Selbstschutz\" was initially successful in protecting their communities against Makhno's partisans but was overwhelmed once the anarchists aligned themselves with the Red Army, which had entered Ukraine in February 1919. The Mennonites of the Molotschna colony were under joint Makhnovist-Red occupation until the Whites broke through the southern front in May 1919.\n\nFollowing Makhno's devastating attack on Denikin's rearguard in September–October 1919, the Mennonite colonies found themselves once more under Makhnovist occupation. The year 1919 saw the greatest number of Mennonites killed – some 827 or 67% of all Mennonite civil war deaths. The great majority of these occurred between October and December. During this period major massacres occurred in Eichenfeld (Yazykovo), Blumenort (Molotschna), Steinfeld and Ebenfeld (Borozenko) and Münsterberg (Zagradovka) while under the administrative control of the Makhnovists. The Chortitza colony also suffered a great degree of death and robbery. Despite ongoing debate and investigation into Makhno's personal culpability for the massacres, there is currently no evidence he was present at or sanctioned these actions. According to the research of Peter Letkemann 3,336 Russian Mennonites, or three percent of their total population, died between 1914 and 1923. Ninety-six percent of these deaths occurred in Ukraine.\n\nLike the White army, the Ukrainian People's Republic and forces loyal to the Bolsheviks, Makhno's forces were accused of conducting pogroms against Jews in Ukraine, based on the Bolshevik accounts of the war. However, these claims have never been proven. Anarchist Paul Avrich writes, \"Makhno's alleged anti-Semitism...Charges of Jew-baiting and of anti-Jewish pogroms have come from every quarter, left, right, and center. Without exception, however, they are based on hearsay, rumor, or intentional slander, and remain undocumented and unproved.\" Avrich notes that a considerable number of Jews took part in the Makhnovist anarchist movement. Some, like Vsevolod Mikhailovich Eikhenbaum, also known as \"Voline\", and Aron Baron were intellectuals who served on the Cultural-Educational Commission, wrote his manifestos, and edited his journals, but the great majority fought in the ranks of the Anarchist Black Army, either in special detachments of Jewish artillery and infantry, or else within the regular anarchist army brigades alongside peasants and workers of Ukrainian, Russian, and other ethnic origins. Together they formed a significant part of Makhno's anarchist army. Significantly, during the Russian civil war, the \"Merkaz\" or \"Central Committee of the Zionist Organization in Russia\" regularly reported on many armed groups committing \"pogroms\" against Jews in Russia, including the Whites, the Russian Ukrainian 'Green' nationalist Nikifor Grigoriev (later shot by Black Army troops on Makhno's orders) as well as Red Army forces, but did not accuse Makhno or the anarchist Black Army of directing pogroms or other attacks against Russian Jews. According to Peter Kenez, “He was a self-educated man, committed to the teachings of Bakunin and Kropotkin, and he could not fairly be described as an anti-Semite. Makhno had Jewish comrades and friends; and like Symon Petliura, he issued a proclamation forbidding pogroms.” Kenez goes on to claim (with no evidence, reason or source) that the anarchist leader could not or did not impose discipline on his soldiers. In the name of ‘class struggle’ his troops with particular enthusiasm robbed Jews of whatever they had.” This would be in the spirit of standards of behaviour which Makhno promoted for his troops, which called for war against \"the rich bourgeoisie of all nationalities\" be they Russian, Ukrainian or Jewish, as well as his explicit order not to beat or rob \"peaceful Jews\".\n\nWhile the bulk of Makhno's forces consisted of ethnic Ukrainian peasants, he did not consider himself to be a Ukrainian nationalist, but rather an anarchist. His movement did put out a Ukrainian-language version of their newspaper and his wife Halyna Kuzmenko was a nationally conscious Ukrainian. In emigration, Makhno came to believe that anarchists would only have a future in Ukraine if they Ukrainianized and he stated that he regretted that he was writing his memoirs in Russian and not in Ukrainian. Makhno viewed the revolution as an opportunity for ordinary Ukrainians – particularly rural peasants – to rid themselves of the overweening power of the central state through self-governing and autonomous peasant committees, protected by a people's army dedicated to anarchist principles of self-rule.\n\nBolshevik hostility to Makhno and his anarchist army increased after Red Army defections. The \"Nabat\" confederation was banned and the Third Congress (specifically Pavel Dybenko) declared the \"Makhnovschina\" (Ukrainian anarchists) outlaws and counter-revolutionaries. In response, the Anarchist Congress publicly questioned, \"[M]ight laws exist as made by few persons so-called revolutionaries, allowing these to declare the outlawing of an entire people which is more revolutionary than them?\" (Archinoff, The Makhnovist Movement). The Bolshevik press was not only silent on the subject of Moscow's continued refusal to send arms to the Black Army, but also failed to credit the Ukrainian anarchists' continued willingness to ship food supplies to the hungry urban residents of Bolshevik-held cities.\n\nVladimir Lenin soon sent Lev Kamenev to Ukraine, who conducted a cordial interview with Makhno. After Kamenev's departure, Makhno claimed to have intercepted two Bolshevik messages, the first an order to the Red Army to attack the Makhnovists, the second ordering Makhno's assassination. Soon after the Fourth Congress, Trotsky sent an order to arrest every \"Nabat\" congress member. Pursued by White Army forces, Makhno and the Black Army responded by withdrawing further into the interior of Ukraine. In 1919, the Black Army suddenly turned eastwards in a full-scale offensive, surprising General Denikin's White forces and causing them to fall back. Within two weeks, Makhno and the Black Army had recaptured all of the southern Ukraine.\nWhen Makhno's troops were struck by a typhus epidemic, Trotsky resumed hostilities; the Cheka sent two agents to assassinate Makhno in 1920, but they were captured and, after confessing, were executed. All through February 1920 the Free Territory – Makhnovist region – was inundated with Red troops, including the 42nd Rifle Division and the Latvian & Estonian Division – in total at least 20,000 soldiers. Viktor Belash noted that even in the worst time for the revolutionary army, namely at the beginning of 1920, \"In the majority of cases rank-and-file Red Army soldiers were set free\". Of course Belash, as a colleague of Makhno's, was likely to idealize the punishment policies of the Batko. However, the facts bear witness that Makhno really did release \"in all four directions\" captured Red Army soldiers. This is what happened at the beginning of February 1920, when the insurgents disarmed the 10,000-strong Estonian Division in Huliaipole. To this it must be added that the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine included a choir of Estonian musicians. The problem was further compounded by the alienation of the Estonians by Anton Denikin's inflexible Russian chauvinism and their refusal to fight with Nikolai Yudenich.\n\nThere was a new truce between Makhnovist forces and the Red Army in October 1920 in the face of a new advance by Wrangel's White army. While Makhno and the anarchists were willing to assist in ejecting Wrangel and White Army troops from southern Ukraine and Crimea, they distrusted the Bolshevist government in Moscow and its motives. However, after the Bolshevik government agreed to a pardon of all anarchist prisoners throughout Russia, a formal treaty of alliance was signed.\n\nBy late 1920, Makhno had halted General Wrangel's White Army advance into Ukraine from the southwest, capturing 4,000 prisoners and stores of munitions, and preventing the White Army from gaining control of the all-important Ukrainian grain harvest. Upon the signing of a truce in the Polish–Soviet War further west, additional Red Army were freed to also participate in the southern campaign that pursued Wrangel and the remainder of his forces down the Crimean peninsula. To the end, Makhno and the anarchists maintained their main political structures, refusing demands to join the Red Army, to hold Bolshevik-supervised elections, or accept Bolshevik-appointed political commissars. The Red Army temporarily accepted these conditions, but within a few days ceased to provide the Makhnovists with basic supplies, such as cereals and coal.\n\nWhen General Wrangel's White Army forces were decisively defeated in November 1920, the Communists immediately turned on Makhno and the anarchists once again. After refusing a direct order by the Bolshevik government to disband his anarchist army, Makhno intercepted three messages from Lenin to Christian Rakovsky, the head of the Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet based in Kharkiv. Lenin's orders were to arrest all members of Makhno's organization and to try them as common criminals. On November 26, 1920, less than two weeks after assisting Red Army forces to defeat Wrangel, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed. Makhno escaped, but was soon forced into retreat as the full weight of the Red Army and the Cheka's \"Special Punitive Brigades\" was brought to bear against not only the Makhnovists, but all anarchists, even their admirers and sympathizers.\n\nIn August 1921, after making raids all across Ukraine and constant battles with Red army forces many times larger and better equipped an exhausted Makhno was finally driven by Mikhail Frunze's Red forces into exile with 77 of his men fleeing to Romania, then Poland, Danzig, Berlin and finally to Paris. In 1926, he joined other Russian exiles in Paris as part of the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad (Группа Русских Анархистов За Границей) who produced the monthly journal \"Dielo Truda\" (Дело Труда, The Cause of Labour). Makhno co-wrote and co-published the \"Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists\" (often referred to as the \"Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists\"), which put forward ideas on how anarchists should organize, based on the experiences of revolutionary Ukraine and the defeat by the Bolsheviks. The document was initially rejected by many anarchists, but today has a wide following. It remains controversial to this day, continuing to inspire some anarchists (notably the platformism tendency) because of the clarity and functionality of the structures it proposes, while drawing criticism from others (including, at the time of publication, Voline and Malatesta) who viewed its implications as too rigid and hierarchical.\n\nAt the end of his life Makhno lived in Paris and worked as a carpenter and stage-hand at the Paris Opera, at film-studios, and at the Renault factory. He died in Paris on July 25, 1934, from tuberculosis. He was cremated three days after his death, with five hundred people attending his funeral at the cimetière du Père-Lachaise in Paris. Makhno's widow and his daughter Yelena were deported to Germany for forced labor during World War II. After the end of the war they were arrested by the NKVD. They were taken to Kiev for trial in 1946 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor. They lived in Kazakhstan after their release in 1953.\n\nIn 1919, Nestor Makhno married Agafya (aka Halyna) Kuzmenko, a former elementary schoolteacher (1892–1978), who became his aide. They had one daughter, Yelena. Halyna Kuzmenko personally carried out a death sentence of Nikifor Grigoriev, a subordinate commander who committed a series of anti-semitic pogroms (according to other accounts, Grigoriev was killed by Chubenko, a member of Makhno's staff or Makhno himself).\n\nTwo of Makhno's brothers were his active supporters and aides before being captured in battle by the German forces and executed by firing squad.\n\nAccording to Paul Avrich, Makhno was a thoroughgoing anarchist and down-to-earth peasant. He rejected metaphysical systems and abstract social theorizing.\n\nVoline, one of his biggest supporters who was active for several months in the movement, reports that Makhno and his associates engaged in sexual mistreatment of women: \"Makhno and of many of his intimates – both commanders and others... let themselves indulge in shameful and even odious activities, going as far as orgies in which certain women were forced to participate.\" However, Voline's allegations against Makhno in regards to sexual violations of women has been disputed by some on the grounds that the allegations are unsubstantiated, do not stand up to eyewitness accounts of the punishment meted out to rapists by the Makhnovists, and were originally made by Voline in his book \"The Unknown Revolution\" which was first published in 1947, long after Makhno's death and following a bitter falling-out between Makhno and Voline.\n\nMakhno was also accused of alcoholism. Voline wrote that \"[Makhno's] greatest fault was certainly the abuse of alcohol...Under [its influence], Makhno became irresponsible in his actions; he lost control of himself.\" This charge by Voline, like the aforementioned accusations, was not made until years after Makhno's death. Alexandre Skirda notes that Bulgarian comrades who knew him throughout his life categorically deny this charge. Skirda further notes that he was unable to unearth any first-hand evidence of Makhno's alcoholism.\n\nNestor Makhno was the main antagonist in the 1923 Soviet adventure film \"\" a.k.a. \"Red Devils\". He was portrayed by Odessa gangster and part-time actor Vladimir Kucherenko. The film gives an extremely negative portrayal of Makhno and the Makhnovists. Makhno, played by Vladimir Stutyrin, also featured in the sequel \"Savur Mogila\" (1926).\n\nPlayed by the famous Soviet actor Boris Chirkov, Makhno was also a character in the 1942 epic film \"Alexander Parkhomenko\" where he sang the \"Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo\".\n\nMichael Moorcock's \"A Nomad of the Time Streams/The Nomad of the Air: volume 3: The Steel Tsar\" (1981) is an alternate history/steampunk novel where Makhno, still alive in 1941, is an important supporting character.\n\nA song by Lyube, \"Batko Makhno\" (1989) was a smash hit, as its lyrics carried a suggestive theme of the times of Red Terror. The song was released soon before the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nMakhno was the main character in the 2006 Russian series \"Nine Lives of Nestor Makhno\" (\"Devyat zhizney Nestora Makhno\"), a 12-part series about his life. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35037144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35037144", "title": "Obște", "text": "Obște\n\nThe obște (pl. \"obști\") was an autonomous agricultural community of the Romanians/Vlachs during the Middle Ages. Mixing private and common ownership, the communities generally employed an open field system. The obști were usually based on one or more extended families. This system of organization was similar throughout the Vlach-inhabited areas and it generally receded as overlords assumed more power over the rural communities and as the peasants lost their freedom by becoming serfs.\n\nThe word \"obște\" is of Slavic origin, its original meaning being \"common\", referring to the common ownership and usage of the fields. Nevertheless, the organization system is assumed to predate the Slavic contact, previously the word for community being cătun (cognate with Albanian katund), a word that changed its meaning in modern Romanian into \"hamlet\" or \"mountain village\".\n\nThe villages, autonomous and lacking a political superstructure, employed their own defense system: the very words for village in Romanian (\"sat\", archaic \"fsat\") and Albanian (\"fshat\") are derived from the Latin word \"fossatum\", meaning \"a ditch used for fortifications\".\n\nMost villages were not ancient, but they were founded and discarded during successive colonization steps. As extensive farming was used, the areas with depleted soil were abandoned for new land, often obtained through deforestation. Sometimes, they were divided into more groups, each looking to found its own obște on fertile land, something known as the \"swarming of the obști\" (\"roirea obștilor\").\n\nThe villagers in an obște were often the descendants of the founder (or sometimes, founders) of the village, which was known as \"moș\" (\"forefather\"). By the 16th century, in Wallachia, each extended family (\"moșneni\", people with a common forefather) had its own tracts of land which they used in common.\n\nThe obști had their own common law system, known in Romanian as \"obiceiul pământului\" (\"custom of the land\"), an unwritten law system which set rules for the relations between the villagers, including the rules for the usage of the land. The obști had judicial powers on their members, the elders of the village being the judges.\n\nWhereas some historians such as Ioan C. Filitti argued that the obști were an exceptional way of organization and a recent development, Nicolae Iorga argued that the obște was one of the most ancient institutions of the Romanian peasant, being prior to the founding of the medieval Romanian states.\n\nSome historians such as P. P. Panaitescu argued that its origin can be found in the organization of the Dacian settlements, which was revived following the Roman retreat. As arguments for its origin being previous to the Slavic contact are given words such as \"gint\" (pl. \"ginture\") which was a term of Latin origin (from \"gens\"/\"gentilis\") to refer to a community formed by an extended family.\n\nSimilar systems of organizations were found among the Slavs and Germans. In the region, it was found among the East Slavs, where it was known as \"obshchina\" or \"mir\", the West Slavs where it was known as \"opole\" and the Serbs, where it was known as \"okolina\".\n\nAs the feudal states were created, the obști were affected by the system of princely decrees, which gave land (\"danii\") to a newly created nobility. This led to a gradual disappearance of the common ownership of land, transforming the free peasants into serfs. The feudal system, which was already formed by the 15th century, did not destroy the obști, but a greater number of obști became serf obști: while the Hospodar or the boyars owned the whole villages, they kept their internal organization.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, it was still found in some mountainous areas of Romania, such as Vrancea and Câmpulung in Moldavia as well as Dragoslavele and Rucăr in Wallachia.\n\n"}

He was engaged to Dot Rhone and actress Jane Asher, and he married three times: to Linda Eastman, Heather Mills, and Nancy Shevell.\n\nMcCartney had a three-year relationship with Dot Rhone in Liverpool, and bought her a gold ring in Hamburg. In London, McCartney had a five-year relationship with Asher, and lived in her parents' house for three years. He wrote several songs at the Ashers' house, including \"Yesterday\". Asher inspired other songs, such as \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\", and \"I'm Looking Through You\". On 25 December 1967 they announced their engagement, but they separated in early 1968. \n\nMcCartney met the American photographer Linda Eastman in a club in London while still with Asher. They met again at the launch party for the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper\" album. In May 1968, McCartney met Eastman again in New York, and they were married on 12 March 1969. They had three children together and remained married until her death from breast cancer in 1998.\n\nMcCartney appeared publicly beside Heather Mills at a party in January 2000, to celebrate her 32nd birthday. On 11 June 2002, they were married at Castle Leslie in Glaslough, Ireland. They had one child, Beatrice, in 2003 but were living apart by May 2006. In July 2006, British newspapers announced that McCartney had petitioned for divorce. On 17 March 2008, the financial terms of the divorce were finalised, which awarded Mills £24.3 million ($38.5 million). In November 2007, McCartney started dating Nancy Shevell, who was a member of the board of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and is vice president of a family owned New England Motor Freight. It was announced on 6 May 2011 that the two had become engaged, and they married in London on 9 October 2011.\n\nOne of McCartney's first girlfriends, in 1959, was called Layla; a name he remembered as being unusual in Liverpool at the time. She was slightly older than McCartney and used to ask him to baby-sit with her. Julie Arthur, another girlfriend, was Ted Ray's niece.\n\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was seventeen year old Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone (a bank clerk or a cashier at a chemist's, according to varying accounts), whom he had met at The Casbah Club in 1959. McCartney picked out the clothes he liked Rhone to wear and told her which make up to use, also paying for her to have her blonde hair done in the style of Brigitte Bardot, whom both he and John Lennon idolised. He disliked Rhone seeing her friends, and stopped her from smoking, even though he did so himself. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with The Beatles he wrote regular letters to Rhone, and she accompanied Lennon's girlfriend, Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when the group played there again in 1962. According to Rhone, McCartney bought her a gold ring in Hamburg, a leather skirt, took her sightseeing, and was very attentive and caring. For the time Rhone was there, the couple lived in a bungalow by the Hamburg docks that belonged to Rosa, a former cleaner at the Indra club. McCartney admitted that he had other girlfriends in Hamburg when Rhone was in Liverpool, admitting that they were usually strippers, who knew a lot more about sex than Liverpool girls.\nRhone later rented a room in the same house as Cynthia Lennon was living, with McCartney contributing to the rent. Shortly after McCartney returned from Hamburg in May 1962, Rhone told him that she was pregnant. They told McCartney's father, Jim McCartney, whom they expected to be shocked at the news, but found him delighted at the prospect of becoming a grandfather. McCartney took out a marriage licence and set the wedding date for November, shortly before the baby was due. Rhone had a miscarriage in July 1962, and after a few weeks, McCartney's feelings towards Rhone \"cooled off\", and he finished their relationship.\n\nHe then had a brief relationship with Thelma Pickles, who had previously dated Lennon. She later married Liverpool poet Roger McGough, but remembered McCartney as growing from a \"plump young schoolboy into someone very much his own person\" during their time together. McCartney also had a fiery \"on-off\" relationship with Iris Caldwell, the younger sister of singer Rory Storm, who refused to bow to McCartney's demands. After one argument, Caldwell poured a bowl of sugar over his head, but when McCartney turned up the next day, she had to phone her new boyfriend, George Harrison, to cancel their date.\n\nRhone later emigrated to Toronto, Canada, and McCartney met her again when the Beatles played there, and then again with Wings. Rhone later said that \"Love of the Loved\" and \"P.S. I Love You\" were written about her. Years later, Cynthia Lennon gave back to Rhone the gold ring that McCartney had bought her in Hamburg, having once tried it on while Rhone was washing dishes, and forgotten to take it off. Rhone is now a grandmother and lives in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\nMcCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963, when the Beatles performed at the Royal Albert Hall, in London, after a photographer asked them to pose with her. They were then interviewed by Asher for the BBC, with Asher being photographed screaming at them like a fan. McCartney soon met Asher's family: Margaret, her mother was a music teacher, and Asher's father Richard was a physician. Her brother, Peter, was a member of Peter and Gordon, and her younger sister, Clare, was also an actress. McCartney later gave \"A World Without Love\" to Peter and Gordon, as well as \"Nobody I Know\". Both songs were hits for the duo. McCartney took up residence at the Ashers' house at 57 Wimpole Street, London, and lived there for nearly three years. During his time there McCartney met writers such as Bertrand Russell, Harold Pinter, and Len Deighton. He wrote several songs at the Ashers', including \"Yesterday\", and worked on songs with Lennon in the basement music room. Asher inspired many songs, such as \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\", and \"I'm Looking Through You\".\n\nOn 13 April 1965, McCartney bought a £40,000 three storey Regency house at 7 Cavendish Avenue, St. John's Wood, London, and spent a further £20,000 renovating it. He thanked the Ashers by paying for the decoration of the front of their house. On 15 May 1967, McCartney met American photographer Linda Eastman at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails in London. Eastman was in the UK on an assignment to take photographs of \"swinging sixties\" musicians in London. They met again four days later at the launch party for the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album at Beatles' manager Brian Epstein's house in Belgravia, but after her assignment was completed, she flew back to New York. On 25 December 1967, McCartney and Asher announced their engagement, and she accompanied McCartney to India in February and March 1968.\n\nDark haired model Maggie McGivern was dating a photographer when, in 1966, she embarked on a secret relationship with McCartney. \nShe had just taken on a steady job working for Marianne Faithfull and John Dunbar as the nanny to their little boy Nicholas, and it was while taking care of Nicholas in Marianne’s third floor Chelsea flat that she first encountered Paul McCartney. He buzzed the intercom to ask if John (Dunbar) was around, and when Paul explained who he was, Maggie invited him straight up. “Paul ran up the stairs and came in. Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” \nThey began a secret three-year affair which ended just before Paul married Linda.\n\nAsher broke off the engagement in early 1968, after coming back from an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, but finally broke up in July 1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss that part of her life. Schwartz, a twenty-three-year-old New York scriptwriter, had travelled to London to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London. She attended many sessions during the recording of the \"White Album\", and was living with McCartney when Lennon and Yoko Ono were also invited to live there. Shortly after, Schwartz sold the story of her time at Cavendish Avenue to \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\n\nIn May 1968, McCartney met Eastman again in New York, when Lennon and McCartney were there to announce the formation of Apple Corps. In September, McCartney phoned her and asked her to fly over to London. Six months later they were married at a small civil ceremony—when Eastman was four months pregnant with their child, Mary McCartney—at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. He later said that his wife was the woman who \"gave me the strength and courage to work again\", after the break-up of the Beatles. McCartney adopted her daughter from her first marriage, Heather, and had three children together: Mary, Stella, and James McCartney. McCartney taught Linda to play keyboards, and permanently included her in the line-up of Wings.\n\nLinda died of breast cancer at age 56 in Tucson, Arizona, on 17 April 1998; McCartney denied rumours that her death was an assisted suicide. Along with eight other British composers, he contributed to the choral album \"A Garland for Linda\", and dedicated his classical album, \"Ecce Cor Meum\", to his late wife. McCartney has said that he and Linda spent less than a week apart during their entire marriage, excluding McCartney's incarceration in Tokyo on drug charges in January 1980.\n\nAfter having sparked the interest of the tabloids about his appearances at events with former model, amputee, and campaigner against landmines Heather Mills, McCartney appeared publicly beside her at a party in January 2000, to celebrate her 32nd birthday. On 11 June 2002, McCartney married Mills in an elaborate ceremony at Castle Leslie in Glaslough, County Monaghan, Ireland, where more than 300 guests were invited and the reception included a vegetarian banquet. On 28 October 2003, Mills gave birth to a daughter, Beatrice Milly McCartney, although the date has also been stated as 30 October.\nThe baby was reportedly named after Mills' mother Beatrice, and McCartney's Aunt Milly.\n\nOn 29 July 2006, British newspapers announced that McCartney had petitioned for divorce, which sparked a media furore. On 17 March 2008, the financial terms of the divorce were finalised, with a settlement awarding Mills £24.3 million ($38.5 million). The settlement stated that McCartney pay their four-year-old daughter Beatrice's nanny, school fees, and pay Beatrice £35,000 ($70,000) a year until she is 17, or ends her secondary education. After the divorce ruling, Justice Bennett said that throughout the case Mills was \"inconsistent, inaccurate and less than candid\" while McCartney was \"honest.\" On 12 May 2008, Justice Hugh Bennett issued a decree nisi, which would become final after a period of six months apart.\n\nMcCartney started dating Shevell in November 2007. She was a member of the board of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority as well as vice president of a family-owned transportation conglomerate that includes New England Motor Freight. She resigned from the MTA board in January 2012. It was announced on 6 May 2011 that the two had become engaged. On 9 October 2011 McCartney and Shevell were married at Old Marylebone Town Hall where his first wedding took place in 1969. The couple attended Yom Kippur synagogue services prior to the wedding, out of respect for Shevell's Jewish faith, but did not seek a religious blessing for their union. Upon their marriage, Shevell became Lady McCartney. McCartney wrote the song \"My Valentine\", from his 2012 album \"Kisses on the Bottom\", about Shevell. She is a cousin of broadcast journalist Barbara Walters.\n\n"}

Initially wearing a ski mask to intervene in a public assault, Fodor later developed a full costume and adopted \"Phoenix Jones\" as a pseudonym. From 2011 until its dissolution in 2014, Jones was the leader of the Rain City Superhero Movement, a Seattle, Washington based citizen patrol group that described itself as a crime prevention brigade.\n\nJones says the best way to prevent getting mistaken for a criminal by the police is to wear a \"supersuit\", although local police have expressed concern that the strange costumes may lead to emergency calls from citizens who mistake the \"superheroes\" for criminals. Jones says that all members of the Rain City Superhero Movement have a military or mixed martial arts background.\n\nJones is also a mixed martial artist signed to World Series of Fighting, where he has fought at two catchweights, which included fighting his older foster brother UFC, Strikeforce and ONE Championship fighter Caros Fodor.\n\nJones says he wanted to take policing matters into his own hands after a few incidents changed his mind about Seattle. The first was when Jones says that his car was broken into and his son was injured after returning to the vehicle and falling on the broken glass. Jones was told that several people saw the break-in happen, but did not intervene. Later, Jones says that he encountered a friend being seriously assaulted outside a bar, and after calling 911 he put on the mask from the earlier break-in and \"made a commotion\" until the police showed up. \"And I thought, why didn’t someone help him? There were seventy people outside that bar and no one did anything.\"\n\nJones went on to develop a full costume and pseudonym, when his crime-fighting behavior made him too recognizable. In a CBS news broadcast, Jones is shown entering a back room of an unnamed comic book store in which he changes into costume which consists of a Dragon Skin brand bulletproof vest and stab plating, as well as equipment including a stun baton, pepper spray or tear gas, handcuffs and a first aid kit.\n\nJones later became part of the Rain City Superhero Movement. In July 2011, local police recorded ten citizens patrolling the city in superhero costumes, using the names Thorn, Buster Doe, Green Reaper, The Mantis, Gemini, No Name, Catastrophe, Thunder 88, Penelope and Phoenix Jones. An individual using the pseudonym \"Red Dragon\" has also self-identified as being a member of the group.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if he would have someone arrested for smoking cannabis, Jones said he considered it a low priority, and that he has no problem with people using drugs, but wants drug dealers to \"sell somewhere else.\"\n\nIn 2012, a video was released online by self-described super-villain Rex Velvet, criticizing Jones and his anti-crime efforts. \n\nJones reports being stabbed with a knife while trying to intervene with a drug dealer and a citizen, damaging part of his costume which had to be repaired. He has told police that his ballistic vest helped stop a bullet during an incident in Tacoma.\n\nIn 2011, Jones claims to have had his nose broken by an assailant while attempting to break up a fight, when one of the men pulled a gun on him while another one kicked him, breaking his nose. This incident was never reported to police, and was treated by Jones' private doctor. Jones and Velvet traded insults for several years via social and local media until Jones' retirement.\n\nSeattle City Attorney Pete Holmes has called Jones a \"deeply misguided individual.\"\n\nIn October 2011, Jones was arrested for investigation of assault, after using pepper spray to break up an alleged fight. He spent approximately seven hours in jail before posting the $3,800 bail. No charges were filed and the case was dropped later that month.\n\nJones appeared in court wearing a black and gray striped shirt over his costume on October 13, 2011. A court officer asked Jones to remove his mask, and he complied, putting the mask back on after the hearing. Jones then spoke with reporters and removed his mask again to reveal his identity as Ben Fodor. Fodor stated that he would continue patrolling the city:\nBen Fodor began his amateur MMA career in December 2006. Over the next four years, he amassed a record of 15 wins and 2 losses as an amateur.\n\nFodor made his professional MMA debut in November 2013 for the Cage Warrior Combat promotion based in his native Washington state. Fodor is the younger foster brother of Strikeforce and UFC veteran Caros Fodor. \n\nOn March 11, 2015, it was announced that Fodor had signed an exclusive contract with World Series of Fighting. Fodor made his debut at WSOF 20 on April 10, 2015, wanting to be known under his pseudonym \"Phoenix Jones\". He faced Emmanuel Walo and lost the fight via unanimous decision, his first loss in his professional career, leaving with a record of 5 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss.

{"id": "26380532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26380532", "title": "Ramsay Bolton", "text": "Ramsay Bolton\n\nRamsay Bolton, formerly known as Ramsay Snow and also as Bastard of Bolton or Bastard of the Dreadfort, is a fictional character in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIntroduced in 1998's \"A Clash of Kings\", Ramsay is the eldest son of Roose Bolton, the lord of the Dreadfort, an ancient fortress in the North of the kingdom of Westeros. He is subsequently mentioned in \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000) and \"A Feast for Crows\" (2005). He later appears in Martin's \"A Dance with Dragons\" (2011).\n\nRamsay is portrayed by Welsh actor Iwan Rheon in the HBO television adaptation.\n\nRamsay Snow is the bastard son of Lord Roose Bolton of Dreadfort, and is conceived out of Roose murdering a miller and raping the victim's wife. A year later the woman arrived at the Dreadfort with the newborn Ramsay, and Roose gave the woman the mill along with a pig, several chicks and a bag of silver coin every year on the condition that she never reveal to Ramsay the truth of his parentage. Ramsay's mother arrived at the castle years later claiming she needed help in raising Ramsay, who grew up wild and unruly, so Roose sent a servant known as Reek to Ramsay and his mother as a cruel jest. However Ramsay and Reek grew inseparable, and even Roose would later reflect on whether Ramsay had corrupted Reek or whether Reek had corrupted Ramsay. Despite Roose's instruction to Ramsay's mother, either she or Reek eventually informed him of his true parentage.\n\nRamsay is an ugly young man, even when dressed finely. He is big boned and slope shouldered, with a fleshiness indicating he will be fat later in life. His skin is pink and blotchy, his nose broad, his hair long and dark and dry. Although his mouth is small, his lips are wide and meaty, wormy looking, and has a wet-lipped smile. His distinctive eyes resemble Roose's — small, close-set and oddly pale, like two chips of dirty ice. Ramsay sometimes wears a garnet cut in the shape of a drop of blood in his right ear, and a black leather jerkin over a pink velvet doublet slashed with dark red satin, along with black boots, belt and scabbard. For battle Ramsay wears dark armor with a pale pink cloak, and a red rounded helm and gorget that resemble the face and shoulders of a skinless, bloody man whose mouth is open in a silent scream. Ramsay's weapons include a falchion, a dagger, and a flaying knife, all with hilts of yellow bone. Though savage in battle, he was never officially taught at arms, and his swordsmanship style is vicious and highly aggressive, wielding his sword as if it were a butcher's cleaver. Ramsay's personal steed is named Blood, and he keeps a pack of female hunting hounds.\n\nRamsay has a group of men-at-arms companions called the Bastard's Boys (though never within their or Ramsay's hearing), who follow him although their true allegiance lies with Lord Roose to spy on Ramsay. Ramsay is a depraved sadist renowned for his savage cruelty: he tortures prisoners and enthusiastically engages in the forbidden old Bolton custom of flaying captured enemies alive. He openly enjoys having young peasant women stripped naked and released into the forests, before hunting them down with feral dogs. After raping the victims first, he would give a quick death to women who give him \"good sport\" then flays their corpses, and likes to \"honor\" them by naming his dogs after the victims he enjoys most. The women who do not give him good sport are raped and then flayed alive. The skins of his kills are brought back to Dreadfort as gruesome trophies, and the bodies of the victims are fed to his dogs.\n\nWhile most bastards content themselves with life, Ramsay had larger ambitions. He considers himself a true Bolton despite his birth and is highly resentful of his baseborn status and will violently correct those who refer to him otherwise. Roose suspects that it was Ramsay who murdered Roose's trueborn heir Domeric, and expects that Ramsay will kill all of Roose's future children. The suspected poisoning of Domeric also earned Ramsay the enmity of House Dustin, as Lady Barbrey Dustin was fond of her nephew Domeric. Two years prior to the beginning of the series, Roose brought Ramsay to the Dreadfort as he had no other sons, and Ramsay learned to read and write. He is a cunning and capable manipulator who is particularly good at thinking on his feet, though less savvy when it comes to long-term consequences and intricate politics. Roose chides Ramsay for his abusive \"amusements\" as it goes against Roose's creed of creating \"a peaceful land, a quiet people\" image for House Bolton's rule, but Ramsay refuses to listen.\n\nRamsay Bolton is not a point of view character in the novels, and remains mostly in the background. His actions are witnessed and interpreted directly through the eyes of Theon Greyjoy, and indirectly from stories heard by Bran Stark and Davos Seaworth.\n\nWhile his father is at war in \"A Clash of Kings\", Ramsay is named castellan of the Dreadfort. After Lord Hornwood and his heir are killed fighting for Robb Stark, Ramsay forcibly marries Lady Hornwood to claim her lands, before starving her to death. He escapes justice by switching places with his servant Reek, who is killed instead; Rodrik Cassel brings Ramsay, in the guise of Reek, back to Winterfell, intending to have him testify to Ramsay's crimes before being executed. However, Theon Greyjoy and the Ironborn capture Winterfell and release Ramsay in exchange for a vow of service to Theon. When Theon's hostages escape, Ramsay murders two peasant boys and convinces Theon to present the corpses as those of Bran and Rickon Stark. As the Northerners move to take back Winterfell, Ramsay persuades Theon to let him ride to the Dreadfort to gather reinforcements. He returns with an army of Bolton soldiers and massacres the Northern relief force, but then proceeds to kill the Ironborn, burn Winterfell, and take Theon prisoner.\n\nPrior to the Red Wedding, Roose Bolton presents Robb Stark with a piece of Theon's skin, revealing that Ramsay has been flaying him; though disgusted, Robb acquiesces to Theon's further captivity, as Theon's father Balon has recently died and Theon's absence presents a succession crisis for the Ironborn. Following Robb Stark's death, King Tommen Baratheon legitimizes Ramsay as a Bolton. The Lannisters pass off Jeyne Poole as Arya Stark and send her north to be betrothed to Ramsay, with only the Lannisters and Boltons aware she is not the real Arya Stark.\n\nIn the dungeons of the Dreadfort, Ramsay has savagely tortured and mutilated Theon until he is so broken and in fear of Ramsay that he has adopted the identity of Reek. Ramsay coerces him to assist in lifting the Ironborn siege of Moat Cailin, subsequently reneging on his promise of safe passage to the Ironborn by having the garrison flayed. After Stannis Baratheon's capture of Deepwood Motte, Ramsay's wedding to \"Arya\" is moved from Barrowton to a rebuilt Winterfell. Following the wedding, Ramsay repeatedly abuses Jeyne. Shortly after the wedding, Jeyne and Theon escape with the help of Mance Rayder. Jon Snow later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that he has captured Mance and killed Stannis Baratheon (who was besieging Winterfell), threatening to destroy the Night's Watch if Jon does not deliver Theon, Jeyne, and several other members of Stannis' court to Ramsay as captives. It is not revealed how much of the letter is true or if Ramsay was its actual author, but the contents are enough to enrage Jon enough to decide to seek out and kill Ramsay instead, though he is stabbed by his own men before he can leave Castle Black.\n\nIn a released sample chapter, Stannis is revealed to be alive and preparing for battle against Roose and Ramsay, contradicting Ramsay's letter. Theon, who is now Stannis' prisoner, warns Stannis not to underestimate Ramsay or even call him \"Ramsay Snow\", but Stannis, who does not fear Ramsay, brushes Theon's warnings aside.\n\n \n\nRamsay Bolton was played by Welsh actor Iwan Rheon in the HBO television adaption of the series of books, who received positive reviews for his performance. Rheon had previously auditioned for the role of Jon Snow, which he lost to Kit Harington. Ramsay is first mentioned in the show's second season and first appears onscreen in the third, though Rheon is credited as \"Boy\" until his true identity is revealed in the third-season finale \"Mhysa\".\n\nRamsay's dog appears to be a Cane Corso.\n\nThe circumstances of Ramsay's conception and acknowledgement do not change in the show, although in the show Ramsay's mother dies soon after his birth. Ramsay is raised at the Dreadfort, knowing nothing of his mother. At the age of eleven, he first encounters the Dreadfort kennelmaster's daughter, Myranda, and is drawn to her fearlessness, eventually taking her as his mistress. He tells her that he plans on wedding her but after his legitimization, he dismisses such promises.\n\nAfter Theon Greyjoy and his forces capture Winterfell, Roose Bolton offers to Robb Stark to have Ramsay and the men left at the Dreadfort lift the occupation. Robb agrees, with orders to spare the Ironborn if they surrender, but to bring Theon to Robb alive. The Ironborn subdue Theon and present him to Ramsay, who takes Theon prisoner, but Ramsay then proceeds to sack Winterfell and flay the Ironborn garrison for his own amusement.\n\nRamsay sends word to the Stark forces at Harrenhal claiming that the Ironborn sacked Winterfell and fled before the Bolton forces arrived. In the Dreadfort dungeons, Ramsay's men gruesomly torture Theon while Ramsay watches on in the guise of a cleaning boy. Claiming to be a servant of Theon's sister Yara, he sets Theon free before sending his men after Theon, only to follow and kill them when they recapture Theon. Theon confesses that during his conquest of Winterfell he used two farmer's boys to fake the murders of Bran and Rickon Stark, as Ramsay pretends to lead Theon to Deepwood Motte, the castle Yara holds. In reality, Ramsay leads Theon in a circle back to the dungeon and reimprisons him, tormenting Theon with the revelation that he was the architect of his suffering all along.\n\nAfter severing Theon's pinky, he has Myranda and another servant seduce him; however, this is only intended to taunt Theon before Ramsay severs his genitals. He sends Theon's penis to his father Balon, threatening to further mutilate him and to flay the other Ironborn invaders unless they flee the North; Balon refuses, as he now has no use for Theon. Theon begs Ramsay to kill him, but Ramsay states that Theon is more useful alive. Noting Theon's stench, he dubs him \"Reek\" and beats him until he responds to his new name.\n\nWhen Roose Bolton returns to the Dreadfort, he reprimands Ramsay for having overstepped his boundaries as castellan by mutilating a valuable hostage and sending terms of surrender to the Greyjoys. Infuriated, Ramsay demonstrates his brainwashing of Reek by having him reveal that Bran and Rickon Stark are still alive, and having Reek shave him without harming him, even after revealing Roose's murder of Robb Stark. Impressed, Roose orders Ramsay and Reek to lift the Ironborn occupation of Moat Cailin. Yara and her men infiltrate the Dreadfort and try to rescue Theon, but he refuses to go with her, fearing another of Ramsay's tricks, and Ramsay chases the Greyjoy soldiers away with his hounds. Pleased with Reek's loyalty, Ramsay has him pose as Theon to convince the Ironborn holding Moat Cailin to surrender, with promise of safe passage, though Ramsay reneges on his word and flays the entire garrison. As reward for his success, Ramsay is legitimised as a Bolton. He then accompanies the rest of House Bolton in moving to Winterfell.\n\nRamsay draws the ire of Roose after flaying the family of a Northern lord who refuses to pledge fealty. In order to placate the other Northern houses and to solidify the Boltons' hold on the North, Ramsay is betrothed to Sansa Stark, publicly believed to be the last living Stark. Though he initially feigns kindness to Sansa, after Myranda shows her Reek in the kennels, Ramsay uses Sansa's contempt for Reek as psychological torment, by having him apologise for \"killing\" Bran and Rickon, having him give Sansa away at the wedding, and ultimately forcing Reek to watch as he rapes Sansa on their wedding night. When Sansa begs Reek to signal for help, Reek instead warns Ramsay, who flays a maid who had tried to help Sansa.\n\nWith Stannis Baratheon's forces camped and ready to march on Winterfell, Ramsay persuades Roose to let him and twenty men infiltrate his camp and destroy his supplies. The plan succeeds, ultimately causing most of Stannis' army to desert him. The remnants of the Baratheon army march on Winterfell, but the Bolton cavalry, led by Ramsay, defeat them with ease. In the chaos of the battle, Theon kills Myranda and flees with Sansa.\n\nAfter mourning Myranda, Ramsay is warned by Roose that he faces being disinherited if Sansa is not recovered and Roose's unborn child is a son. Ramsay sends his best hunters after Sansa and Theon, though they are all killed by Brienne of Tarth. After Roose's wife Walda gives birth to a boy, Ramsay promptly murders his father and has his hounds maul Walda and his newborn half-brother to death, securing his position as Lord Bolton and the official ruler of Winterfell.\n\nRamsay is approached by Smalljon Umber, who asks for his help in defending the North against the wildlings Jon Snow has offered refuge to at the Wall. To secure their alliance, Smalljon presents Ramsay with Osha and Rickon Stark, who were previously under the protection of Smalljon's now-deceased father, the Greatjon. Ramsay kills Osha when she tries to assassinate him, and throws Rickon in Winterfell's dungeons. He then sends a letter to Jon Snow at Castle Black, threatening to exterminate the wildlings and have Rickon and Jon killed if Sansa is not returned to him.\n\nJon Snow responds by leading an army of Wildlings and assorted Stark loyalists on a march towards Winterfell. As the Stark and Bolton armies prepare for battle, Ramsay releases Rickon and tells him to run to his half-brother before killing him with an arrow. With Jon having charged out in a futile attempt to save Rickon, his forces follow behind and are drawn out of their position. The Bolton phalanx quickly surrounds the Starks, but the Knights of the Vale arrive and overwhelm the Boltons. Ramsay flees to Winterfell, and kills the giant Wun Wun when he breaches Winterfell's gate, but is attacked and brutally beaten by Jon. Locked in the kennels, Ramsay is visited by Sansa, who watches as his hungry hounds eat Ramsay alive. Ramsay's death marks the end of House Bolton and its rule in the North.\n"}

The marriage was dissolved in 1952.\n\nBorn in Hallow, Worcestershire, into a distinguished ecclesiastical family, Stewart Perowne was the grandson of John Perowne, the Bishop of Worcester, and the son of Helena Frances (née Oldnall-Russell) (1869–1922) and Arthur William Thomson Perowne, who was the first Bishop of Bradford and subsequently also Bishop of Worcester. His older brother was Francis Edward Perowne (1898–1988). His younger brother, Leslie Arthur Perowne (1906–1997), was Head of Music at the BBC and was responsible for bringing Albert Ketèlbey out of retirement to conduct a huge BBC Ketèlbey Concert at the Royal Albert Hall prior to World War II.\n\nPerowne was educated at Haileybury College, where he was a champion sprinter, and at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied Classical Archaeology and Architecture He then studied at Harvard where he gained a graduate degree in Classics. He went to Palestine in 1927 under the British Mandate, as Head of Education in the Palestine Government Education Service, teaching at the Anglican St George's School in Jerusalem. He became fluent in spoken and written Arabic. In 1930 Perowne transferred to the administrative branch of the Palestine Government, working for a time as Assistant District Commissioner for Galilee. In 1931 he was appointed an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John.\n\nHe later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and Israel. He was awarded the Coronation Medal in 1937. In 1938 Perowne worked for the BBC, preparing talks and features for transmission by the overseas Arabic service. In the same year he deposited a collection of potsherds with the British Museum, most of which are of Bronze Age type and probably derive from the ancient site of Subr. In 1939 he was appointed Public Information Officer in Aden, where he developed a passion for archaeology, and where he discovered the seventh century BC sites of Imadiya and Beihan. In 1941 Perowne was appointed Public Relations Officer to the British embassy in Baghdad. In 1944 he succeeded the scholar Vyvyan Holt as oriental counsellor.\n\nDuring his diplomatic postings he designed stamps for Malta (1936), the Aden Protectorate (1938), Barbados (1949), Libya (1951), and currency notes for the West Indies Federation (1949) and Libya (1951).\n\nBecause of his career as a diplomat it was expected that Perowne should marry. As a homosexual he decided to embark on a mariage blanc, and on 7 October 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer Freya Stark at St Margaret's church in Westminster. She was his senior by eight years and had been his assistant in Yemen when he was Information Officer. Stark's biographer has argued that she may not have known of Perowne's homosexuality, and of his taste for men in uniform. \"In 1947 people's sexual proclivities were still part of their private lives and … no one among Freya's friends seemed able to warn her of the pitfalls of marriage to a homosexual.\" Confused as to why Perowne would not sleep with her, she wrote to him, \"I think you have left something lying between us, untold. Whatever it is, it will not make me think less of you or care less for you.\" Eventually, after skirting around the subject, he wrote to her:\nIt is difficult to say what \"normal\" is – my friend a counsellor of St. George's Hospital always refuses to use the word and in both men and women, you have a wide and graded range from ultra-male to ultra-female with naturally most people in the middle ranges ... Now for myself, I put myself in the middle group. I have ordinary male abilities. I like male sports some of them, and I love the company of women. In fact, I find it hard to exist without it. At the same time, I am occasionally attracted by members of my own sex – generally. For some even pleasurable reason – by wearers of uniform.\nDespite their similar interests the marriage could not survive and they divorced in 1952. There were no children.\n\nIn 1947 Perowne was appointed Colonial Secretary to Barbados where he was a member of the island's Legislative Council before becoming political adviser in Cyrenaica from 1950 to 1951. Here he discovered the ancient city-site of Aziris. Taking early retirement in 1951, after his divorce in 1952 he returned to Palestine, now the State of Israel, where he assisted Weston Henry Stewart, the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem in designing and organising model villages for Palestinian Arabs who had been made refugees as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He was an Adviser to the UK delegation to the UN Assembly in Paris in November 1951. During this period he also began to write, his first book being \"Jerusalem, The One Remains\" (1954). Later books included \"The Life and Times of Herod the Great\" (1958), \"The Later Herods\" (1958), \"Hadrian\" (1960), \"Caesars and Saints\" (1962), \"The End of the Roman World\" (1966), and \"The Death of the Roman Republic\" (1969). Other books among the 18 he wrote include guides to Athens, Jerusalem, Rome and Malta. In addition, he was a frequent contributor to various edited works, encyclopaedias and academic journals, including \"Antiquity\". Perowne was appointed OBE in 1944 and a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John (KStJ) in 1955. In 1957 he was named Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA). He was a Member of the Church of England Foreign Relations Council.\n\nPerowne died in 1989 at Charing Cross Hospital in London aged 87 years old. He was survived by his former wife, Freya Stark.\n\n\n\n"}

Von Haselberg lives and works in New York, US; and Routh lived in Leicester, UK at the time of his death from cancer. From 1971 the duo were also known as Harry and Harry Kipper.\n\nMartin von Haselberg and Brian Routh met in 1970 at East 15 Acting School. After months of improvisation they invented a character they called Harry Kipper and began experimenting with different theatrical formats to use him in. Upon being expelled for being \"too experimental\" they took to the road, touring constantly. When von Haselberg and Routh coined the name Kipper Kids, they were originally called Harry and Alf Kipper and had two distinctly different characters. Because von Haselberg and Routh could never remember who was Harry and who was Alf, they dropped the name Alf and decided to call each other Harry. At the same time they decided to make their characters identical. Thus the Kipper Kids as Harry Kipper and Harry Kipper were born in 1971.\nFrom 1971 to 1975, most of their performances took place in Europe.In 1974 David Ross, later director of the Whitney Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, saw them in performance at Gallerie Rudolf Zwirner in Cologne and invited them to do some shows in California. The Kipper Kids moved to Los Angeles in 1975. Despite having studiously avoided being part of a movement, they found themselves associated with the early years of punk in Los Angeles. \n\nIn 1982 they stopped actively collaborating, performing as The Kipper Kids only occasionally until their final performance together at the National Review of Live Art, Glasgow in 2003.\n\nRouth was married to net.art pioneer Nina Sobell from 1975-1981. From 1981–87 he was married to performance artist Karen Finley. Routh was married to digital artist Patricia Wells from 2012 until Routh's death in 2018.\n\nVon Haselberg has been married to Bette Midler since 1984.\n\nQuoting from an announcement for the Berkeley Art Museum: \"Through actions that at times stress the visual, and the violent aspects of social rituals, the British Team of Harry and Harry Kipper perform in a fashion that combines the zany theatrics of Spike Milligan with a scatological slapstick that is all their own\". Routh and von Haselberg created elaborate but purposely low-tech installations in which they would perform \"ceremonies\" using mostly found objects. Examples are \"Tea Ceremony\" (1972) a Japanese tea ceremony-inspired piece and \"Boxing Ceremony\" (1972) in which one performer beats himself until bloodied whilst the other acts as referee. Japanese rituals, English music hall, Viennese Actionism, and the work of Samuel Beckett were amongst their influences.\n\nThe Kipper Kids made two projects for television. For HBO they produced \"Mum's Magic Mulch\", and for Cinemax, \"K.O. Kippers\", while the Kids also appeared in a 1982 project for HBO executive produced by von Haselberg, \"The Mondo Beyondo Show\", a one-off variety show of sorts for performance artists (including a pre-Stomp Yes/No People, La La La Human Steps, Bill Irwin, Paul Zaloom and others) hosted by Bette Midler's Mondo Beyondo character. Von Haselberg made a number of films at American Film Institute with Routh in the lead role: \"Quiet Lives\" (1991), \"People Are No Damn Good\" (1991) and \"Your Turn To Roll It #54\" (1992). They also were seen as characters in the 1980 film \"Forbidden Zone\" and the 1989 film \"UHF\". Another television appearance came during the fifth season of ABC's \"Moonlighting\". First aired on Valentine's Day, 1989, \"I See England, I See France, I See Maddie's Netherworld\" featured The Kipper Kids as a pair of gravediggers in a surreal dream sequence, along with leading cast members Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis. The Kipper Kids also performed a song in the 1991 comedy film \"The Addams Family\" — \"Playmates\" which can be heard in the film and on its soundtrack. They also starred in the 1990 comedy film \"The Spirit of '76\".\n\nCurrently Martin von Haselberg has created a series of large photographic images made into inflatable sculptural shapes titled 'Floatulents', and is a painter. In the decade before his death, Brian Routh created soundworks that incorporated vocal soundbites of world leaders, politicians, madmen, poets, murderers and others.\n\n"}

The museum was created to perpetuate and propagate the life and work of composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov. The Memorial Museum is under the control of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe museum was created in 1975 on the initiative of the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Azerbaijan SSR Heydar Aliyev. The composer lived in this house from 1915 to 1942. The museum consists of 4 rooms, a glass-lounge, a cinema hall, an exhibition hall and an administrative unit. People's artist of Azerbaijan Kazim Kazimzade and architect Eduard Kruiki greatly contributed to the design and preparation of the museum. On February 28, 2005, in honor of the 120th anniversary of Uzeyir Hajibeyov, President Ilham Aliyev signed an order to carry out major repairs in the museum house.\n\nFrom the memoirs of director and the People's Artist of the USSR I. Sharoyev:\n\nThe expositions in museum shows of the composer's life and creativity, as well as the personal things of the composer. Everything in this house is kept as it was in Uzeyir bey's time. A dining table with silver dishes, samovar, copper bowls, gramophone, radio receiver, gifts from his friends and etc.. Together with Uzeyir Hajibeyov's desk all the items on the table are kept. All the items belonging to him on the table - his watch, glasses, even the unfinished part of the symphonic poem \"Azerbaijan\" is still on his desk. The exposition tells about the musical scenes of Hajibeyov from the first opera in the entire Middle East \"Leyli and Majnun\", up to the classic \"Koroghlu\". The museum has done a great job for 40 years, the exposition has been updated several times, and the fund is enriched annually.\n"}
{"id": "64131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64131", "title": "William Luther Pierce", "text": "William Luther Pierce\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 – July 23, 2002) was an American white supremacist, neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic author and political commentator. He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels \"The Turner Diaries\" and \"Hunter\". Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel \"The Turner Diaries\", which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, \"Hunter\", portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", publishing the internal newsletter \"National Alliance Bulletin\" (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, \"National Vanguard\" magazine (originally titled \"Attack!\"), \"Free Speech\" and \"Resistance,\" as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities. His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence. Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.; he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942. After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction. His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962–1965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962, but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, \"National Socialist World\". When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP.\n\nAccording to the American neo-Nazi James Mason, during the first National Socialist World Congress in 1969, when a delegate asked what should be done with \"White race traitors\", Pierce formed with his hand a pistol being fired, rousing the audience to its feet.\n\nIn 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency. In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance. Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, \"National Vanguard\" magazine (originally titled \"Attack!\"), \"Free Speech\" and \"Resistance,\" as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service. Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision. Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab–Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash. Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes. In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes. The other were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series \"Different Drummer\" produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS. He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on \"60 Minutes\", during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\". Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi, although he personally rejected this label. When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on \"60 minutes\", Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States. As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn. Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute informational video titled \"America is a Changing Country\", and forming an anti-globalization group – the Anti-Globalization Action Network – to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002. On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work \"The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds\" (2001). The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the Hávamál in the Poetic Edda:\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by \"The Turner Diaries\" (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \"terrible yet absolutely necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground resistance, called The Organization, led by the secret inner circle known as The Order (a reorganized SS).\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters. Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"\n\n\"The Turner Diaries\" also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order. The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance. The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington, when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to \"The Turner Diaries\" to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, \"Hunter\", which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called \"Hunter\" more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian, Pierce became an atheist as a teenager. In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of cosmotheism, based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, \"Man and Superman\". The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word \"cosmos\" means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia. In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iván Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce. Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997.\n\nThe following works were published under the pseudonym \"Andrew MacDonald\":\n\nIn 1993, Pierce wrote the script of the comic book \"New World Order Comix #1: The Saga of White Will\" which was illustrated by Daniel \"Rip\" Roush and coloured by William White Williams.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}
