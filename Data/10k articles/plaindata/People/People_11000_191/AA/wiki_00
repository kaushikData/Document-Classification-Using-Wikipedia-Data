He is featured in ancient Arabic literature.\n\nSome say that Ma'ad ibn Adnan had a brother called Al-Dith, and that he was actually Akk. However, others say that Akk was the son of Al-Dith, and thus a grandson of Adnan. Nevertheless, the majority agree that Akk and Al-Dith are the same person, the son of Adnan. \n\nIf Akk and Al-Dith are the same person, then his mother and the mother of Ma'ad ibn Adnan were the same.\n\nAkk dwelt in the Yaman because he took a wife amongst the Asharites and lived with them, adopting their language. The Asharites were descended from Saba' ibn Yashjub ibn Ya'rub ibn Qahtan. \n\nAkk was the founder of a Southern Arabian tribe, the tribe of Akk. According to the following verse, the mother of Madhij (the founder of another Southern tribe that settled in Jordan) was from Akk:\n\nWoe to the mother of Madhij from Akk!\n(That is the mother of Madhij weeping) \n\nSome genealogists say that Akk departed for Samran, in the Yemen, leaving his brother Ma'ad. This is because, when the people of Hadur killed Shu'ayb b. Dhi Mahdam al- Haduri, God sent Nebuchadnezzar II against them as a punishment. Armiya and Barkhiya went away taking Ma'ad with them, and when the warfare had died down they took him back to Mecca. Ma'ad then found that his brothers and uncles who were descended from Adnan had joined the peoples of the Yemen and had intermarried with them; the Yemenites had been sympathetic to them because they were descendants of Jurhum. They quote the following verse as proof of this story:\n\nWe left our brothers, al-Dith and Akk <br>\non their way to Samran, and they departed quickly. <br>\nThey were of the Banu Adnan, <br>\nbut they lost this descent irrevocably among themselves. \n\n"}
{"id": "1264989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1264989", "title": "Andreas Vollenweider", "text": "Andreas Vollenweider\n\nAndreas Vollenweider (born 4 October 1953) is a Swiss harpist. He is generally categorised as a new-age musician and uses a modified electroacoustic harp of his own design. He has collaborated with Bobby McFerrin, Carly Simon, Luciano Pavarotti and in 1987 received a Grammy Award for the album \"Down to the Moon\". Vollenweider's style has been described by \"The New York Times\" as \"swirling atmospheric music, which evokes nature, magic and fairy tales\". He has toured internationally and produced fourteen regular albums in a career that spans four decades.\n\nVollenweider was born in 1953 and is the son of Hans Vollenweider (1918–1993), an organist and composer, while his mother was a painter. In 1971, he married Beata, a kindergarten teacher, with whom he has two sons (Jonathan and Sebastian) and a daughter, Noëmi. In 1975, Vollenweider discovered the harp and, finding its traditional versions too limited for his own musical ideas, developed his own style, tailoring the instrument according to his needs. He created the electro-acoustic harp. He formed the trio \"Poesie und Musik\" together with Rene Bardet (bass) and Orlando Valentini (guitar), recording interpretations of the poetry of François Villon and Heinrich Heine, but left in 1978. During this period, Vollenweider also wrote music for film, mainly nature documentaries.\n\nIn 1979 he released his solo debut, \"Eine Art Suite in XIII Teilen\" in Switzerland. He subsequently began forming his ensemble “Andreas Vollenweider and Friends”, which included Walter Keiser (drums), Pedro Haldemann (percussion), Bobby Reveron (percussion), and Jon Otis (percussion). This five-piece debuted on July 11, 1981 at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Vollenweider was discovered by the German record-producer and manager Vera Brandes, who oversaw the release of \"Behind the Gardens - Behind the Wall - Under the Tree...\". through her VeraBra Records. The album was distributed through CBS Records International and reached 32 in the German album charts in March 1982. The follow-up \"Caverna Magica\" was recorded in the period May–November 1982 while Vollenweider and his band performed around Europe. Released in January 1983, the album managed to reach 11 in the German album chart. In 1983, he underlined his commitment to environmental issues with the EP \"Pace Verde\" in support for Greenpeace, which was accompanied by a video that Vollenweider directed and produced himself. In October of that year he was awarded a Dutch Edison Award in the \"Instrumental\" category for \"Caverna Magica\".\n\nIn 1984, the album \"White Winds\" entered the American billboard chart. Released through CBS Masterworks in North America, his records remained on catalogue, clocking up to six-figure sales. Vollenweider embarked on his first American tour in November of that year, making his debut at the Beacon Theatre, New York. It was presented by Carly Simon who had come across his music a year earlier. She explained that \"I knew I had discovered something that was going to change me in a wonderful way, I became so obsessed with his music that anyone who came to my house was introduced to it within the first 10 or 15 minutes\". Through CBS she got in contact with the artist and arranged for his American debut. As his instrumental tracks were generally deemed unsuitable for radio, he largely relied on word-of-mouth in gathering an international following.\n\nVollenweider spent much of 1985 on tour, promoting the \"White Winds\" album with his five-piece band. The shows were described as a new age experience that combined the use of lights and dry ice while Vollenweider appeared as a \"white-clad figure who's poised to drive the audience wild with a harp\". In 1987, \"Down To The Moon\", which had been originally recorded and released in 1984, received a Grammy Award. This was followed by tours in Canada, the United States, thirteen European countries, Japan, and Australia. When he composed the music of, and recorded, the dynamic album \"Dancing With The Lion\" in 1988 and 1989, Vollenweider opened his project, for the first time in his career, to numerous guests from a wide range of musical genres. He directed and produced two award-winning videos, one of which was for the title selection; for both videos, he contributed to the storyline, the choreography, and set/costume designs. \n\nVollenweider's double album \"The Trilogy\" (1990), consisted of a selection of the first three albums (\"Behind The Gardens\", \"Caverna Magica\", and \"White Winds\") and previously unreleased material. In 1991, he followed up with \"Book of Roses\", which included symphonic orchestral elements for the first time. In 1992, he participated in a benefit show for Chernobyl's children on Moscow's Red Square. The same year, he won the World Music Award in Monaco. In 1993-94, he produced his first album including vocals. The 1993–94 album \"Eolian Minstrel\" featured contributions from American singers Carly Simon and Eliza Gilkyson. The release was followed by worldwide tours. \n\nIn 1994, he performed at the Pavarotti and Friends event in Modena, Italy, where he played duets with operatic lyric tenor Luciano Pavarotti (a native of Modena) and Canadian rock balladeer Bryan Adams. After conducting tours and open-air shows in Europe and the United States, in 1995 he played in Latin America for the first time. 1995–97 saw Vollenweider playing a series of shows in remarkable locations: a tour of Polish castles, a show with Italian singer/songwriter Zucchero at the 2500 m high location (at -8° Celsius) of Brunico in the Southern Alps, and in a giant volcanic cave at Lanzarote's Festival Musica Visual. \n\nIn 1998, Vollenweider began the recording of \"Kryptos,\" a work for symphonic orchestras and guest virtuosos from all over the world. He initiated a symphonic live project which he called \"Wolkenstein\". In 1999, he returned to free improvisation and intimate musical dialogues with his album \"COSMOPOLY\" He invited friends, including American vocal acrobat Bobby McFerrin, Brazilian cult poet and singer Milton Nascimento, South-African ethno-jazz pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, the 74-year-old Armenian duduk legend Djivan Gasparyan, Galician bag-pipe and whistle virtuoso Carlos Núñez Muñoz, the American singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and American blues-trombone master Ray Anderson, from all over the globe to create “world music”.\n\nThroughout 2000, he traveled with the \"COSMOPOLY\" project in Europe. Its changing configuration of musicians — almost daily — enabled Vollenweider to follow the open concept of the album. In New York City, he and his friends played two concerts for the United States release. Carly Simon joined the group, as did Mindy Jostyn, Carlos Núñez, Djivan Gasparyan, XiaoJing Wang and Walter Keiser. Concerts in Brazil — with Milton Nascimento and composer/pianist Wagner Tiso — followed. In 2001, Vollenweider performed in Bali (Indonesia) at the international conference \"song of convergence\" with Balinese musicians. He began writing the \"symphonic novel\" \"Tales of Kira Kutan\", which premiered at the Warsaw Film Music Festival 2001, with the orchestra Sinfonia Varsowia (Yehudi Menuhin), conducted by co-orchestrator André Bellmont. Returning to his native Switzerland, Vollenweider premiered \"Carte blanche\" at the AVO Festival in Basel, where his guests, in addition to a mini orchestra, included Abdullah Ibrahim and David Lindley.\n\nIn 2002, he performed at the Budapest Spring Festival in Hungary. Performances of the symphonies \"Tales of Kira Kutan\" and \"Wolkenstein\" at the Festival \"Live at Sunset\" in Zurich, with Sinfonia Varsovia, followed, as did a European summer tour, with the newly formed AVAF-mini orchestra, that included a performance at the \"Big Chill Festival\" in England and continued that fall. It was around this time that he collaborated with German film composer Hans Zimmer, in Los Angeles, on the music score for the movie \"Tears of the Sun\" (starring Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci). In 2003, he continued his work with Zimmer. A performance followed, with his mini orchestra, in Johannesburg and at the \"North Sea Festival\" in Cape Town. \n\nIn 2004 and 2005, AVAF continued to increase touring activities in Europe. At this time, Vollenweider's entire catalogue was re-mastered and re-released on new record labels worldwide (USA/Canada: www.kinkoumusic.com; international: www.edel.com). A compilation, \"The Best of \"Magic Harp\", was released in the United States and Canada, and \"The Storyteller\" was released in Europe. A four-hour DVD was also produced. He played for the Dalai Lama, when the latter paid a visit in Zurich. In 2005, he released the album \"VOX\". \n\nIn the first three months of 2006, following extensive touring in Europe, Vollenweider conducted his first tour of the US in over ten years, touring from coast to coast. At that time, he also released his first DVD, \"The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider\", which contained almost four hours of live concerts, documentaries, interviews. During the summer of that year, he recorded a new album, titled \"Midnight Clear\", in which he again collaborated with Carly Simon. (See above for his previous collaborations with her.) The last three months of 2006 saw Vollenweider touring in Europe, in addition to his release of \"Midnight Clear\" on a worldwide basis and that of the DVD \"The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider\" in the rest of the world. 2007 saw Vollenweider draw his third nomination for a Grammy Award for the soundtrack album of the current DVD release \"The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider\". Concerts in Europe and the United States followed, as did, in September of that year, the release of the two-CD double album \"Andreas Vollenweider & Friends - 25 Years Live\", which covered the period from 1982 to 2007. \n\nIn 2008, during his composition of the music for, and his recording of, the album \"A I R\", Vollenweider was a guest performer at the celebration concert for the 80th birthday of Armenian duduk legend Jivan Gasparyan.\n\nIn 2010, Vollenweider gave concerts in Eastern and Western Europe. In June, he undertook a special concert project, which he titled \"The Watercourse Way,\" at the Shanghai Centre in Shanghai, China, as part of Expo 2010. A \"Dream Concert\" of the extended AVAF followed in August, as did the \"Dancing With The Lion Orchestra\" concert on the shore of Lake Zurich; it featured a gathering of Vollenweider's musical friends from all corners of the world. In 2011, three decades after his first concert, he accepted the invitation of Montreux Jazz Festival founder Claude Nobs to perform an exclusive jubilee concert, on 7 July, at the 45th such Festival, titled \"30 Years Andreas Vollenweider & Friends\". It featured special guests Richard Bona and Raul Midon.\n\nIn 2012, he played at the farewell concert for Claude Nobs, who had died in January of that year. In the same year Vollenweider was granted the Swiss Music Award for \"Outstanding Achievement Award\" for his continuing life's work. On Christmas Eve, Swiss Television broadcasts the first major documentary devoted to Vollenweider, in which filmmaker Cristina Karrer shows impressing and touching sequences recorded in October 2010 in South Africa. In May 2012 Andreas Vollenweider lends his name to a campaign by ROKPA, a charity he has been working with for decades. Children who had once lived on the streets in Kathmandu, Nepal, visit eight Swiss cities to tell their moving stories using theatre, dance and music, with a changing roster of Swiss musical guests and an equally celebrated line-up of TV moderators.\n\nHis style has been described as weaving \"elements of European classical and folk music, Third World vocal and percussive effects and natural sound effects into cyclical suites\". Vollenweider is perceived as one of the purveyors of the New Age genre, although his earlier recordings appeared on the jazz Billboard chart. The composer found that \"what I am doing is really a very old thing, a very 'old age' thing, because I'm doing what people have been doing for thousands of years'.\n\nVollenweider resides near Zurich.\n\nIn the 1980s, Vollenweider was described as someone whose \"politics run to the left, including support for Amnesty International and Greenpeace\". He is an outspoken pacifist and follower of the principles of non-violent conflict management of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n\n\n"}

The title \"Mollah Bāji\" (see \"Mollah\") is indicative that she must have been educated and in charge of more than the daily household chores of Shah's Court. Indeed, she has been in charge of the education of the children in the court of Nasser al-Din Shah.\n\nAt the age of 22, Bibi Khatoon married \"Musa Khan Vaziri\" who was a prominent official in the \"Persian Cossack Brigade\". They had seven children, of whom the most distinguished are \"Colonel Ali-Naqi Vaziri\" (musicologist, composer, a celebrated player of the tar, and the founder of the Academy of Music of Iran as well of Iran's National Orchestra), and \"Hasan Vaziri\" (an artistic painter). Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), founder and director of Iran's \"Women's Society against Environmental Pollution\" (founded in 1992 to educate children and mothers, as well as state's officials, about dangers of environmental pollution) is the maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi.\n\nBibi Khatoon was one of the influential figures in the Iranian constitutional revolution in the late 19th and the early 20th century. She founded the first school for girls (named \"The School for Girls\" — دبستان دوشیزگان) in the modern history of Iran and wrote numerous articles in defence of the right of girls to receive universal education. Her articles appeared in such newspapers as \"Tamaddon\" (تمدن - Civilization), \"Habl al-Matin\" (حبل المتين - Firm Rope) and \"Majles\" (مجلس - Parliament). Bibi Khatoon is also known for her book \"Ma'ayeb al-Rejal\" (معايب الرجال - Failings of Men), which was a critical response to the pamphlet \"Ta'deeb al-Nesvan\" (تاديب النسوان - Edification of Women) by an anonymous author. \"Ma'ayeb al-Rejal\" was published in 1895, eleven years before the inauguration of Iran's system of constitutional monarchy in 1906 by the decree of Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar. This book is considered by some as the first declaration of women's rights in the recent history of Iran.\n\nFounded in 1907 at the residential home of Bibi Khatoon in Tehran, it was attended both by young girls and their mothers as well as grandmothers, for some of the latter it may have been a unique opportunity for obtaining formal education for the first time in their lives. The school was equipped with such facilities as may be taken for granted from the present-day perspective (such as desks), however it should be borne in mind that this school provision was part of Bibi Khatoon's residential home and not part of a purpose-built educational facility. This clearly testifies to Bibi Khatoon's wholehearted dedication to the cause of women's education in Iran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\"The School for Girls\"\n\nA new school, named \"The School for Girls\" [دبستان دوشیزگان], has been opened near the old gate of Mahmmadieh, the Hāji Mohammad-Hossein market. This school consists of a large courtyard and numerous rooms equipped with all necessary school outfits.\n\nFor the opening of this school five female teachers [معلمه] have been appointed, each responsible for one subject, such as \"Nokhost-nameh\" [نخست نامه], Writing/Calligraphy [مشق قلم], History of Iran [تاریخ ایران], Reading [قرائت], Cookery book [کتاب طباخی], Law [قانون], Religion [مذهب], Geography [جغرافیا], Science of Arithmetic [علم حساب]. Teaching will be adapted to the learning ability of each girl or woman.\n\nIn addition, a location has been set aside for teaching in manual arts, such as knitting [کاموا دوزی], gold embroidery [زری دوزی], silk embroidery [خامه دوزی], sewing [خیاطی], etc., and all these teachers are womenfolk [طایفه اناثیه] and with the exception of an aged porter [پیرمرد قاپوچی], no other man will be in the School.\n\nStudents between the ages of seven and twelve will be accepted. Elementary class [اطاق ابتدائی] is for fifteen \"qeran\" per month, practical class [اطاق عملی] for twenty-five \"qeran\" per month. Discount is offered to those in reduced circumstances [فقرأ]. For every two students [from the same family] one will be accepted free of charge. It is hoped that thousands of schools such as this one are to be inaugurated in our dear motherland [وطن عزیز ما].\n\nSignature: Bibi Khanom Astarabadi.\n(Published in the \"Majles\" daily newspaper of 28 March 1907).\n\nThe subjects taught at this school consisted of, in alphabetic order, Arabic language, Arithmetic, Cookery, Geography, History, Law, Music, Persian literature, and Religion, to name but some. It is relevant to point out that in 1936, almost thirty years after the establishment of \"The School for Girls\", 12 women were for the first time admitted to University of Tehran, who entered all faculties.\nAccording to the official data provided by Iran's ministry of higher education, at the turn of the present century some 70% of all students in higher education were women; according to the same data, however, by the same time only 20% of the PhD positions at academic institutions were occupied by women.\n\nThe historical site of \"The School for Girls\" survived in its original form for some 22 years following the death of Bibi Khatoon in 1921; in 1943 this site was sold (for 25,000 Tumans) by the extant members of Bibi Khatoon's direct family.\n\nAccording to Ebrahim Nabavi, \"Ta'deeb al-Nesvan\", published in 1288 AH (1895), is a small booklet authored by one of the princes of the Qajar Court, \"who must have feared his wife so greatly that he has not had the courage to put his name on it as its author\" (in other words, the author of the book is an anonymous Prince). A short summary of the main recommendations in this book, aimed at the \"edification\" of women, is as follows:\n\nThe Vices of Men (Ma'ayib al-Rijal) (1887),a pungent satire, is in fact an answer to an earlier work entitled The Education of Women (Ta'dib al-Niswan (translated into English by E. Powys Mathers in his Eastern Love, vol.iii, London, 1904). The anonymous writer of the latter seems to be a chauvinistic prince, and following the medieval tradition that was not accepted by Shia Muslim clerics. Bibi Khanum's answers to such absurdities are scathingly indignant. She writes that \"genius of the world and unique writer of our times\" seems strangely bereft of his senses. \"He should have first corrected his own vices and then given us advice. One who has no share of existence, how can he inspire life? ...He regards himself as 'Westernized' and 'civilized,' but in fact, he is not even 'half-civilized.'(سیویلیزه و نیم ویلیزه) Does he not know that Europeans treat their women like flowers, and women freely associate with men?\" The indication that the author was westernised clearly indicates, he must have been from the so-called western influenced intellectuals. Strangely enough at the time women had very few rights in the west in comparison to Iran and only in some parts of the western world had been able to claim their rights to inheritance.\n\nThese two works were published by Hasan Javadi as \"Two Qajar Essays on Men and Women: Ta'dib al-Nivan and Ma'ayib al-Rijal\" in Washington in 1992.\nرویایی زن و مرد در عصر قاجار در عصر قاجار: دو رساله تادیب النسوان و معایب الرجال\n\nAccording to Ebrahim Nabavi, \"Ma'ayeb al-Rejal\" consists of two main parts, in one of which Bibi Khatoon responds directly to the contents of \"Ta'deeb al-Nesvan\", and in the other she describes the conditions prevailing in the men's social gatherings of her time. True to her usual style of writing, Bibi Khatoon's tone in this book is derisive. [To be extended at a later occasion.]\n\n\n\n"}

He was also known as one of the 11 among the Fifteen Martyrs of Bicol who were executed in Bagumbayan (Luneta), now Rizal Park, by Spanish authorities at the end of 19th century during the Philippine revolution.\n\nBeing a native, he grew up and was raised in Polangui, in the province of Albay. At the time he was implicated, he was already pursuing a career as a successful professional, and commercial photographer, thereby maintaining his photographic studio at Nueva Caceres, now Naga City. Since at that time, photography was considered as novelty and as one of the luxuries, it made him well known amongst clients who were from families of government officials and businessmen who wanted their portraits taken.\n\nThe onset of Philippine revolution on the last part of 1896 raised concerns among the Spanish authorities of its possible outbreak in the Bicol region. Thus, those who were liberal-minded were bitterly persecuted on grounds of not just holding separatist ideologies but on advocating the overthrowing of Spain's authority in the Philippines. These persecutions involved businessmen and professionals, mostly adherents to Masonry and members of the clergy. Among the arrested was Vicente Lukban, head of Masonic chapter, \"Triangulo Bikol\", belonging to the Masonic lodge, \"La Luz Oriente\", which, upon interrogation, implicated Jacob as one of the active member and supporter of the Katipunan.\n\nOn September 19, 1896, he, along with many others accused with rebellion and sedition, he was arrested. Upon arrest, each of them were hung by their thumbs of fingers and beaten up, starved and insulted. Then they were sent and brought to Manila, for trial by the Provincial Junta of Camarines Sur headed by then Governor Julian Ocampo, on board steamer \"Isarog\" and imprisoned in \"Bilibid\" only to be tortured again. Even so, they were tortured and all, Jacob remained an exemplary as \"the prisoner who suffered the most torture with great fortitude\".

{"id": "1531178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1531178", "title": "Illtud", "text": "Illtud\n\nSt. Illtud (also spelled Illtyd, Eltut, and, in Latin, Hildutus), also known as Illtud Farchog \"Illtud the Knight\", is venerated as the founder-abbot and teacher of the divinity school known as Cor Tewdws, located in Llanilltud Fawr (Llantwit Major) in the Welsh county of Glamorgan. He founded the monastery and college in the 6th century, and the school is believed to be Britain’s earliest centre of learning. At its height, it had over 1000 pupils and schooled many of the great saints of the age, including Saint David of Wales, Gildas the Historian, and Samson of Dol.\n\nSt. Illtud was popular among the very ancient Celts, but there are few dependable sources about his life story. The earliest mention of St. Illtud is in the \"Vita Sancti Sampsonis\", written in Dol, Brittany, about 600 AD. According to this account, Illtud was the disciple of Bishop Germanus of Auxerre in north-central France. According to the St. Sampson biography, Illtud was the most accomplished of all the Britons, and was well versed in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as well as every type of philosophy, including geometry, rhetoric, grammar, and arithmetic. He was also \"gifted with the power of foretelling future events\". It appears that he was an educated Briton living shortly after Rome's departure from the West.\n\nAccording to a rather untrustworthy later Norman \"Life of St. Illtud\", c. 1140, Illtud was the son of a Breton prince and a cousin of King Arthur. According to this \"Life\", Illtud's parents intended him for service in the church and had him educated in literature for this purpose. However, he forsook his religious upbringing, choosing instead to pursue a military career. He took a wife named Trynihid, and became a soldier in western Britain (now Wales), in service first to King Arthur, and then to the King Poulentus. As a result of this, he is sometimes called St. Illtud the Knight. One afternoon, he took a hunting party onto the lands of Cadoc. The party sent a message to the abbot, demanding that the abbot feed them. The abbot deemed their demand to be very rude and improper, but graciously offered them a meal anyway. Before they could enjoy the meal, the ground opened up and swallowed the whole party as just punishment for their impiety. Only Illtud was spared, and he went to St. Cadog on his knees, begging forgiveness for his sinful act. The abbot told him to give up his selfish ways and go back to his religious upbringing. Inspired, Illtud gave up his wife, and became a hermit in the Vale of Glamorgan (a matrimonial detail which, like many of his alleged miracles, may be regarded as fairly dubious).\n\nWhat is certain is that Illtud helped pioneer the monastic life of Wales by founding a monastery in what is now Llantwit Major. This became the first major Welsh monastic school, and was a hub of Celtic Christianity in Sub-Roman Britain.\n\nIlltud's own pupils are reckoned to have included seven sons of British princes and scholars such as Saint Patrick, Paul Aurelian, Taliesin, Gildas and Samson of Dol. Saint David is also believed to have spent some time there.\n\nSt. Illtud's feast day and commemoration is celebrated on 6 November., but the great 'pardon of Ildut at Locildut in Brittany is held on the last Sunday of July. According to legend, Illtud was buried west of the town of Brecon, in the church of Llanilltud (sometimes called Capel Illtud, which was demolished in the late 20th century), on a mountain known as Mynydd Illtud. Near this church, there is a megalithic monument called \"Bedd Gwyl Illtyd\", or the \"Grave of St. Illtud's Eve.\" Until comparatively recently, Illtud was honoured by the practice of ‘watching’ (keeping vigil) at this stone before his festival.\n\nThe \"Life\" tells of Illtyd's bell being recovered from the armies of King Edgar the Peaceful and of Illtyd's protecting his people against the people of yr Hen Ogledd in the time of William the Conqueror. There is also a cross, probably of the ninth century, bearing the inscription: SAMSON POSUIT HANC CRUCEM PRO ANIMA EIUS ILITET SAMSON REGIS SAMUEL ERISAR – \"Samson placed his Cross here for his soul, for the soul of Illtud, Samson, Rhain, Sawyl and Ebisar\".\n\nThere is no formal evidence for a cult of Illtyd surviving from before the 11th century. However, in Celtic countries it is the names of places that tell us most about the existence and veneration of the saints during the oldest times. The town of Llanilltud Fawr (Llantwit Major in English) where Illtud's college is located is of course named for him (Welsh: \"llan\" church enclosure + \"Illtud\" + \"mawr\" great. Literally, Illtud's great church), and was the chief centre of the cult of St Illtud. In Glamorgan many churches are dedicated to him, first and foremost St Illtyd's Church, Llantwit Major, which stands on what is believed to have been the site of the monastery. Many other places are dedicated to him is because they belonged to the Llantwit monastery. Near to Llantwit itself are the villages of Llantrithyd, Llantwit Fardre, and Llantrisant and at Newcastle and Bridgend churches are dedicated to St Illtud. Brecknockshire north of Glamorgan and the Gower area were two more centres of his cult: the church at Llanhamlach east of Brecon is dedicated to him, and lies south of a Megalithic grave called Ty Illtud, which was a site of mediaeval pilgrimage, the inside walls of the grave bearing incised crosses. The grave is thought to have been a retreat of the saint, as was a similar megalithic monument Roc'h Ildut near Coadut (Coat Ildut/Coed Illtud/ Illtud's Wood) in Brittany, sadly demolished in the 19th century. Llantrisant's three saints were Illtud, Gwynno and Tyfodwg. In Merthyr Tudful there are holy wells of Gwynno and Illtud. West of Brecon, the church of Llanilltud is on a mountain known as Mynydd Illtud. Dedications in and around Gower include Ilston, formerly Llanilltud Gwyr, Oxwich, a holy well of S. Iltut in Llanrhidian, Llanilltud Fach, or Llantwit-juxta-Neath and Pen-bre, Carmarthenshire. A 13th century church on Caldey Island, Pembrokeshire, is dedicated to the saint. In north Wales there is a Llanelltyd near Dolgellau. There are no dedications to St Illtud in Cornwall but many in Brittany (approximately 24 if other place-names like Aberildut are included) though they are largely confined to the ancient dioceses of Leon, Treguier and Vannes, with small outliers in the region of Saint Malo, originally in the diocese of his pupil Samson.\n\nJohn Stowe's 1603 list of the bishops of London includes an \"Iltuta\" who is sometimes conflated with Illtud.\n\nAccording to the 12th century \"Life of St. Illtud\", Illtud's father was Bicanus, a minor Breton prince, and his mother was Rieingulid, a princess and daughter of Anblaud, king of Lesser Britannia (Brittany). This is probably meant to be Ewyas, an area on the Herefordshire-Monmouthshire border, which retains many memories of Arthur and Illtud's family. He was alleged to be the cousin of the legendary King Arthur, serving him as a young soldier.\n\nOne medieval Welsh document names Illtud, in his knightly days, as one of the triumvirate (the others were named Cadoc and Peredur) to whom King Arthur gave custody of the Holy Grail. On this basis, some scholars have tried to identify Knight Illtud with Sir Galahad.\n\n"}

He was a full member of the Romanian Academy and its president many times (1876-1882, 1884-1887, 1890-1893 and 1894-1895). He was the older brother and associate of Pantazi Ghica, a prolific writer and politician.\n\nHe was born in Bucharest, Wallachia, to the prominent Ghica boyar family, and was the nephew of both Grigore Alexandru Ghica (who was to become Prince of Wallachia in the 1840s and 1850s) and Ion Câmpineanu, a \"Carbonari\"-inspired radical. His father was Dimitrie (Tache) Ghica and his mother - Maria née Câmpineanu. \nIon Ghica was educated in Bucharest and in Western Europe, studying engineering and mathematics in Mine School of Paris (France) from 1837 to 1840.\n\nAfter finishing his studies in Paris, he left for Moldavia and was involved in the failed \"Frăția\" (\"Brotherhood\") conspiracy of 1848, which was intended to bring about the union of Wallachia and Moldavia under one native Romanian leader, Prince Mihai Sturdza. Ion Ghica became a professor on geology and mineralogy and later professor on political economy at the Academia Mihăileană which was founded by the same Prince Sturdza in Iași (future University of Iași). He is considered the first great Roumanian economist.\n\nHe joined the Wallachian revolutionary camp, and, in the name of the Provisional Government then established in Bucharest, went to Istanbul to approach the Ottoman Imperial government; he, Nicolae Bălcescu, and General Gheorghe Magheru were instrumental in mediating negotiations between the Transylvanian Romanian leader Avram Iancu and the Hungarian Revolutionary government of Lajos Kossuth.\n\nWhile in Istanbul, he was appointed Prince of Samos (1854 - 1859), where he proved his leadership skills by extirpating local piracy (most of which was aimed at transports supplying the Crimean War). After completing the task, Ghica was awarded the honorary title of \"Prince of Samos\" by Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I in 1856.\n\nIn 1859, after the union of Moldavia and Walachia had been effected, Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza asked Ion Ghica to return. Later (1866), despite being trusted by Prince Cuza, Ghica took active part in the secret grouping that secured Cuza's overthrow. He was the first prime minister under Prince of Romania (afterwards King of Romania) Carol of Hohenzollern.\n\nGhica is also noted as one of the first major Liberal figures in the Kingdom of Romania, and one of the leaders of the incipient Liberal Party. His group's radicalism, with its boyar leadership that had engineered the defunct Revolution, surfaced as republicanism whenever Carol approached the Conservatives; Ghica joined the anti-dynastic movement of 1870-1871 that had surfaced with the Republic of Ploiești. The matter of the Liberals' loyalty was ultimately settled 1876, with the exceptionally long Liberal Ministry of Ion Brătianu. In 1881, Ghica was appointed Romanian Minister in London, an office he retained until 1889; he died in Ghergani, Dâmbovița County.\n\nBeside his political distinction, Ion Ghica earned a literary reputation by writing his \"Letters\", addressed to Vasile Alecsandri, his lifelong friend. Conceived and written during his residency in London, the letters depict the ancestral stage of Romanian society, as it appeared to be fading away.\n\nHe was also the author of \"Amintiri din pribegie\" (\"Recollections from Exile\"), in 1848, and of \"Convorbiri Economice\" (\"Conversations on Economy\"), dealing with major economic issues. He was the first to advocate the favoring of local initiatives over foreign investments in industry and commerce - to a certain extent, this took the form of protectionism (a characteristic of the Liberal Party throughout the coming period, and until World War II).\n\n"}

On December 8, 2007 he was named by the FBI as the 489th fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted list. Brown is considered armed and extremely dangerous.\n\nBrown was born in Los Angeles, California in 1969 to David John Brown, Sr. He attended Laguna Beach High School. Brown speaks fluent French and has a master's degree in international business. Brown served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Paris from 1988 to 1990. Between 1990 and 2004, he resided in several places in Orange County, California, including Dana Point and the Corona del Mar neighborhood of Newport Beach.\n\nBrown owned two businesses based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Toys Unlimited and On The Doorstep Advertising, both of which were operated out of his Utah home. Brown had been employed as a toy salesman and golf equipment importer to support his luxurious lifestyle and expensive tastes, such as cars, motorbikes and boats. Brown portrayed himself as a wealthy man, despite the fact he had defaulted on at least one large loan and was racking up tens of thousands of dollars of debt in 2004.\n\nIn November 2004, Brown took a firearms class. He bought a .45-caliber Glock pistol days before the class at Totally Awesome Guns & Range in Salt Lake City. Brown passed a background check, and as part of the class, was fingerprinted and his prints were sent to state and federal authorities. Brown's instructor, Clark Aposhian, described him as \"an obnoxious student\" who was inexperienced with firearms. Brown accidentally fired a round into a truck during a practice shooting. He paid approximately $1,300 in damages to the car owner. At this time, Brown was living in an Ahwatukee, Arizona hotel near an AMC movie theater. He was captured on surveillance tape having a conversation with another man in the hotel lobby. The man is considered to be a possible accomplice or witness; however, his identity remains unknown.\n\nOn November 29, 2004, Robert Keith Palomares, a 24-year-old armored truck guard, was carrying the weekend deposits outside the AMC theater at 4915 E. Ray Road in Phoenix. At approximately 10 a.m., a hooded gunman ambushed and shot Palomares with a .45-caliber semiautomatic Glock. Five out of six bullets fired struck him in the head. Palomares was armed, but did not have time to defend himself. The gunman took a bag of money containing $56,000 in cash, fled into a nearby alley and left on a bicycle. Palomares was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nWitnesses initially described the shooter as a 25- to 30-year-old Hispanic man. Authorities recovered the bicycle and fingerprints, and instead subsequently linked the caucasian Brown to the murder. He was soon considered a prime suspect in the case and an arrest warrant was issued on December 4 by Maricopa County Superior Court charging Brown with first degree murder and armed robbery. Brown was also charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in a federal arrest warrant issued on December 6 by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. Investigators have considered that a possible motive for Brown to commit these crimes could have been his desperate financial situation.\n\nAfter Brown was identified as a suspect, he fled from Arizona to Henderson, Nevada. Brown traveled to Las Vegas and swapped his BMW for a black Cadillac Escalade he had in storage. He traveled to Orange County, California, staying there with relatives until December 6, 2004, when FBI agents carrying out an arrest warrant missed him by two hours. Brown used his credit card at a gas station in South Orange County, went to San Diego near the Mexican border, and then traveled to Portland, Oregon. After this, FBI stated that Brown became a \"ghost\" and went completely off-the-grid.\n\nOn January 16, 2005, authorities found Brown's Cadillac in a long-term parking lot at Portland International Airport. While in Portland, Brown mailed a package containing clothes and golf equipment to his brother David John Brown II in San Diego. On April 20, 2005, David Brown was indicted for obstruction of justice. The indictment claimed he tampered with evidence when he cleaned out Jason's BMW in early December after driving it from a Las Vegas storage facility to California.\n\nBy 2005, the FBI had more than 200 leads in the case. The majority of leads were outside Arizona and dozens were outside the United States, including possible sightings in Canada. Due to his \"California surfer dude\" appearance and his ability to blend into crowds, the FBI has had more leads on Brown than anyone else on the Ten Most Wanted list, with most of the leads unhelpful. Reporters have noted he bears a close resemblance to actor Sean Penn, and one of Penn's body doubles was once mistakenly arrested by authorities who thought he was Brown. Authorities believe that he may be hiding among the Mormon community under an assumed identity, living with a woman who may not know his real identity, or that he has fled the country and could be living in France or Thailand.\n\nOn December 8, 2007, Brown was named by the FBI as the 489th fugitive to be placed on their Ten Most Wanted list. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $200,000 for information leading to his capture (the reward was doubled on March 25, 2013). The most recent confirmed sighting was in August 2008, when an acquaintance of Brown recognized him while they were stopped at a traffic light near Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City. Their mutual recognition prompted Brown to drive through the stoplight. The witness informed authorities of the sighting. According to him, Brown had longer hair and a deeper tan than in the 2004 photograph of his wanted poster.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "148837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148837", "title": "John Browning", "text": "John Browning\n\nJohn Moses Browning (January 23, 1855 – November 26, 1926) was an American firearms designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms many of which are still in use around the world. He made his first firearm at age 10 in his father's gun shop, and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries, and pioneered the development of modern automatic and semi-automatic firearms.\n\nBrowning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. Arguably, his most significant contributions were in the area of autoloading firearms. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt–Browning Model 1895 machine gun a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.\n\nBrowning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the Browning Hi Power pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. His guns are some of the most copied firearms in the world.\n\nHis father Jonathan Browning, who was among the thousands of Mormon pioneers in the mass exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois to Utah, established a gunsmith shop in Ogden in 1852. As was common in the Mormon community at that time, Jonathan Browning was a polygamist, having taken three wives. He fathered 19 children, including John Moses Browning with his wife Elizabeth Caroline Clark.\n\nJohn Moses worked in his father's Ogden shop from the age of seven, where he was taught basic engineering and manufacturing principles, and encouraged to experiment with new concepts. He developed his first rifle, a single-shot falling block action design, then, in 1878, in partnership with his younger brother, co-founded John Moses and Matthew Sandifer Browning Company, later renamed Browning Arms Company, and began to produce this and other non-military firearms. \n\nLike his father, Browning was a Mormon, and served a two-year mission (LDS Church) in Georgia beginning on March 28, 1887.\n\nHe married Rachel Theresa Child (14 Sep 1860 – 30 Sep 1934) on April 10, 1879 at Ogden, Weber, Utah, and the couple had 10 children, two of whom died in infancy.\n\nProduction examples of the Model 1885 Single Shot Rifle caught the attention of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, who dispatched a representative to evaluate the competition. Winchester bought the design for $8,000 and moved production to their Connecticut factory. From 1883, Browning worked in partnership with Winchester and designed a series of rifles and shotguns, most notably the lever action Winchester Model 1887 and the Model 1897 pump shotgun, the falling-block single-shot Model 1885, and the lever-action Model 1886, Model 1892, Model 1894, Model 1895 rifles as well as the long recoil operated semi-automatic Remington Model 8 rifle, many of which are still in production today in some form; over six million Model 1894s had been produced as of 1983, more than any other sporting rifle in history.\n\nWinchester manufactured several popular small arms designed by John M. Browning. For decades in the late 19th Century-early 20th Century, Browning designs and Winchester firearms were synonymous and the collaboration was highly successful. This came to an end when Browning proposed a new long recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun design, a prototype finished in 1898, to Winchester management, which ultimately became the Browning Auto-5 shotgun. As was the custom of the time, Browning's earlier designs had been licensed exclusively to Winchester (and other manufacturers) for a single fee payment. With this new product, Browning introduced in his negotiations a continuous royalty fee based upon unit sales, rather than a single front-end fee payment. If the new shotgun became highly successful, Browning stood to make substantially more fee income over the prior license fee arrangements. Winchester management was displeased with the bold change in their relationship, and rejected Browning's offer. Remington Arms was also approached, however the president of Remington died of a heart attack as Browning waited to offer them the gun. This forced Browning to look overseas to produce the shotgun. However; Remington would later produce a copy of the Auto-5 as the Model 11 which was used by the US Military and was also sold to the civilian market.\n\nHaving recently successfully negotiated firearm licenses with Fabrique Nationale de Herstal of Belgium (FN), Browning took the new shotgun design to FN; the offer was accepted and FN manufactured the new shotgun, honoring its inventor, as the Browning Auto-5. The Browning Auto-5 was continuously manufactured as a highly popular shotgun throughout the 20th century. In response, Winchester shifted reliance away from John Browning designs when it adopted a shotgun design of Thomas Crossley Johnson for the new Winchester Model 1911 SL, (Johnson had to work around Browning's patents of what became the Auto-5) and the new Model 1912 pump shotgun, which was based in small part upon design features of the earlier Browning-designed Winchester Model 1897 shotgun. This shift marked the end of an era of Winchester-Browning collaboration.\n\nJohn Browning was known as a dedicated and tireless innovator and experimenter who sought breakthrough consumer-oriented features and performance and reliability improvements in small arms designs. He did not retire from his career in his later years, but dedicated his entire adult life literally to his last day to these pursuits. On November 26, 1926, while working at the bench on a self-loading pistol design for Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN) in Liège, he died of heart failure in the design shop of his son Val A. Browning. Even the 9 mm semi-automatic pistol he was working on when he died had great design merit and was eventually completed in 1935, by Belgian designer Dieudonne Saive. Released as the Fabrique Nationale GP35, it was more popularly known as the successful Browning Hi-Power pistol, a favorite of sportsmen, gun collectors as well as many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.\n\nThe premium priced Browning Superposed shotgun, an over-under shotgun design, was his last completed firearm design and possibly his most elegant. It was marketed originally with twin triggers; a single trigger modification was later completed by his son, Val Browning. Commercially introduced in 1931 by FN, Browning Superposed shotguns, and their more affordable cousins, the Browning Citori made in Asia, continue to be manufactured into the 21st century, and come with varying grades of fine hand engraving and premium quality wood.\n\nThroughout his life, Browning designed a vast array of military and civilian small arms for his own company, as well as for Winchester, Colt, Remington, Savage, Stevens, and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal of Belgium. Browning firearms have been made, both licensed and unlicensed, by hundreds of factories around the world. Browning Arms Company was established in 1927, the year after Browning's death. In 1977, FN Herstal acquired the company.\n\nThe M1895 Machine Gun saw action in the Spanish–American War with the United States Marines. The Colt M1911, Browning 1917/19, and the BAR saw action with US forces in World War I, World War II and the Korean War, with the M1911 going on to serve as the U.S.'s standard military side arm until 1985; a variant is still used by special operations units of the United States Marine Corps and the design remains very popular amongst civilian shooters and some police departments. The Browning Hi-Power has a similarly lengthy period of service outside the United States, and remains the standard side arm of the Australian and Canadian armed forces. The M2 Browning machine gun, the timeless .50 caliber \"Ma Deuce\", which was developed in 1918, entered service with the US Armed Forces in 1921, and remains in active service for nearly a century with armed forces across the world in a variety of roles. The M4 cannon, a 37mm autocannon, was initially designed by Browning in 1921, and entered service in 1938; it was used both in aircraft and on the U.S. Navy PT boat during World War II.\n\nSeveral of Browning's designs are still in production today. Some of his most notable designs include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was fired in 2013 and now works for the Government Accountability Project, a non-governmental whistleblower support organization.\n\nCrane graduated from Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree in Asian studies in 1980. He then studied at the Arabic Language Unit of the American University in Cairo from 1980-82.\n\nCrane worked as press secretary for Republican Congressman Bill Dickinson, ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, from 1985-87. Dickinson advocated establishing an Office of the Inspector General in the Defense Department. When that office was created in 1982, Crane became one of its first employees, helping to set up the hotlines for whistleblowers to report waste, fraud, or abuse. He had the text of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 printed up as pamphlets for the personnel in the IG's office to refer to in carrying out their responsibilities. Crane's work also included crafting committee press releases involving analysis of the National Defense Authorization Act and consequences for national defense policy.\n\nIn 1987, Crane became Legislative Director and Press Secretary for Silicon Valley Congressman Ernie Konnyu, where he did supervisory work on formulating legislative policy agenda and communications thereof.\n\nBy 1988, Crane moved to the Defense Department's Inspector General office as a Congressional Liaison. He represented the IG on congressional activities and legislation as well as in contacts on legislative and public affairs with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In 1994 Crane was promoted to Director of the Office of Communication in the IG. He managed public affairs efforts including public statements and congressional testimonies regarding US activities in Southwest Asia. He was promoted to a high-level executive position, the Assistant Inspector General for Communications, in 2004. He administered change management and communication policy for Europe, Southwest Asia, and East Asia. He also performed strategic planning and was Principal Advisor to the IG. He was responsible for whistleblowing and transparency, including strategic (internal) and public affairs communications that included responses regarding the Freedom of Information (FOIA) and Privacy Acts. Crane reviewed legislation and advised on legislative changes. He was fired from his post as an assistant inspector general in February 2013, an action he claims came in response to his advocacy on behalf of whistleblowers who faced illegal reprisal from his superiors in the IG and from other areas of the executive branch.\n\nIn October 2013, Crane joined the Government Accountability Project (GAP) as a consultant on legislative impact analysis. At GAP, he works with whistleblowers related to national security and on legislative, FOIA, and Privacy Act impacts.\n\nCrane earned an Executive Master's in leadership from Georgetown University in 2015.\n\nEdward Snowden went to the press with revelations about the NSA due to the experience of previous whistleblowers, such as Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, Ed Loomis, and Diane Roark, who initially reported their concerns within the system and faced intense retaliation.\n\nAfter making his concerns about mistreatment of whistleblowers known to his superiors, Crane was removed from his position in 2013. He was a recipient of the 2015 Joe A. Callaway Award for Civic Courage. He is a major focus of investigative journalist Mark Hertsgaard's book, \"Bravehearts: Whistle-blowing in the Age of Snowden\".\n\n\n"}

He lived in Tolpetlac, some nine miles north of Tenochtitlán and brought up his nephew, Saint Juan Diego, after the latter's parents died. After the 1529 death of Juan Diego's wife, Maria Lucia, Juan Diego moved to be near his then-aged uncle in Tolpet.\n\nAt the time of the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Juan Diego in December 1531, Juan Bernardino fell ill. According to most sources, he contracted \"cocolixtle\", a dreaded fever that normally led to death. On December 9, 1531, Juan Diego returned from his first two apparitions to find his uncle very ill. All that night and next day, Juan Diego tended to his uncle. Towards sunset, it became clear that Juan Bernardino was dying. Juan Diego set out at four the following morning, to bring back a priest to hear his uncle's confession and administer the last rites.\n\nWhile he was gone, Juan Bernardino became too weak to drink the medicine that had been left by his bedside, and he felt he was about to die. Suddenly the room was filled with light and a beautiful radiant lady appeared to him. Our Lady appeared to Juan Bernardino and cured him. He immediately felt that his body had recovered from the fever, and getting up, fell to his knees before the apparition. She told him that she had met Juan Diego and sent him to the bishop with her sacred image imprinted on his tilma. It was at this apparition that she identified herself as 'The Ever Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe' Some analysts believe that she actually said not \"de Guadalupe\" but \"te coatlaxopeuh\" which many scholars translate differently; \"the one that originates from the cliffs\", \"who crushes the stone serpent\", \"the one that has dominion of the serpent\", etc.\n\n(This account of the apparition occurs in the middle of the Guadalupe narrative, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Diego#Guadalupe_narrative.) \n\nNo sooner had Juan Diego demonstrated where the Lady of Heaven ordered her temple to be built than he begged to be excused. He wanted to go home to see his uncle Juan Bernardino, who had been very ill when Juan Diego left him and went to Tlatilolco to call a priest to confess and absolve him, the one whom the Lady of Heaven had told Juan Diego that she had already healed. But they would not let Juan Diego go alone, and instead accompanied him to his home. Arriving, they saw his uncle very happy and in no pain. He was astonished to see his nephew arrive accompanied and greatly honored, and he asked his nephew the reason why they did this and conferred honors upon him. His nephew answered that when he went to call the priest to confess and prepare his uncle, the Lady of Heaven appeared to him on Tepeyacac; she, telling him not to worry since his uncle was already in good health, consoled him much, and she sent him to Mexico, to see the Bishop, so that he might build her a house on Tepeyac. His uncle revealed that it was true that she healed him then and that he saw her the same way that she appeared to his nephew, She told him that she was also sending him to Mexico to see the Bishop. Also then the Lady told him that when he went to see the Bishop, he should reveal what he saw and in what miraculous manner she had healed him and that he would properly name her, just as he needed to name her blessed image, the ever Virgin Holy Mary of Guadalupe.\n\nThen they brought Juan Bernardino into the presence of the bishop, to come to inform and testify before him. The Bishop lodged both of them, him and his nephew, in his house for a few days, until the temple of Queen was built on Tepeyac, where Juan Diego had seen her. The Bishop moved into the main church the holy image of the beloved Lady of Heaven: he took it from the oratory of his palace where he was, for all people to see and admire her image. \n\n"}

David Walliams said \"You have an incredible, natural talent. I think the thing that children often miss is the emotion in a song but you caught it beautifully tonight.\" Alesha Dixon said \"Such a massive song to take on and you did it with ease. The most impressive thing is your control. You rose to the occasion tonight.\" Amanda Holden said \"You did yourself proud, you started off so whispery and quiet but when you went for it, you went for it. It was an electrifying performance.\" Simon Cowell finished with \"You started off a little bit tentative and then you got yourself together.

Mallory ( 1843 or 1856September 4, 1920) was an American writer, publisher, editor, and spiritualist. She was also a \"suffragist, vegetarian, and devotee of metaphysical experiences\". Leo Tolstoy was so influenced by Mallory's magazine, the monthly spiritualist, \"The World's Advance Thought\", that he called her the \"greatest woman in America\".\n\nMallory was editor and publisher of \"The World's Advance Thought and the Universal Republic\" — two periodicals printed under one cover — published for more than thirty years.\n\nLucy A. Rose was born 1843 in Michigan and grew up in Roseburg, Oregon.</ref>}} Her father, Aaron Rose, settled in Oregon early in the 1840s, and the city of Roseburg was named for him. He was one of the first European settlers at a time when the country was an unbroken wilderness. Her mother, Minerva Kellogg Rose, died in giving birth to Lucy. Mallory was reared among Native Americans.\n\nOn June 24, 1860, she married Rufus Mallory, who afterwards represented Oregon in Congress, and who was later one of the most successful lawyers in the Pacific Northwest, and was the senior member of the extensive law firm to which Senator Joseph N. Dolph belonged. She accompanied her husband to Washington, D.C., after which they returned to Salem, Oregon.\n\nIn 1874, the old slavery prejudice was so strong in Oregon that some forty-five African American and mulatto children were prevented from attending the Salem public schools and kept from all chance of acquiring an education, as no Caucasian teachers would condescend to teach them. A public fund was set apart for them, but no one came forward to labor for it. Mallory volunteered to instruct the children, in the face of sneers and ridicule. Her course shamed the people into a sense of duty, and within three years, friction and opposition ended, and the children were admitted into the public schools and classes. Mallory, having no immediate use for the public money which she drew for her work, let it remain in the bank.\n\nIn 1886, she used the fund for the purchase of a printing plant, and soon after, started her monthly magazine, the \"World's Advanced Thought\", with Judge Horatio N. Maguire for assistant editor. After Maguire retired from editorial connection, on account of the pressure of other business affairs, he still contributed to its pages, while Mallory, who was always the proprietor, had full control. Her magazine circulated among advanced thinkers and workers. Tolstoy subscribed to it.\n\nMallory established and maintained the first free reading room in Portland. For thirty years, it was open to all who would enter it. In it were many rare books of spiritualism and philosophy, as well as periodicals, not easily obtainable elsewhere. Mallory, with her All World Soul Communion hour, to be observed around the world, was the pioneer in the \"going into the Silence\" idea, collectively. Many New Thought groups have since practised this method of attaining unity of thought. In addition to her reading room and periodicals, Mallory kept parlors open for meetings held twice or three times a week. Often these were addressed by speakers of world reputation, but oftener, those with unusual ideas spoke there as the one place in the city where they could utter their thoughts in a friendly and hospitable atmosphere. Many tried their speaking powers here for the first time. Elizabeth Towne, publisher of \"Nautilus Magazine\", Holyoke, Massachusetts, was one of these. Prince & Schaffer (2017) described Mallory as an \"anarchist creative\" with her cultural club, the Association of Artists and Authors. Mallory was always a vegetarian.\n\nMallory was a Life Member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. In the early 1900s, the Oregon Vegetarian Society held meetings in the \"Advance Thought\" parlor at the Hotel Mallory, the parlor being owned by Mallory.\n\nHer work, like that of her husband, was in Portland, but their home was on their ranch or fruit farm, out in the suburbs of the city. She had two children, Elmer Ellsworth (1862–1918), and Lulu (1872-1872), who died after 13 days. Mallory died in 1920.\n\nMallory died at age 76 in San Jose, California.\n\n\n\n"}

She is a developer of and stockholder in the Del Mar Country Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, and the owner of the Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco-Resort near Wells, Nevada and the founder of Saving America's Mustangs. She is also a thoroughbred racehorse owner and breeder. She is the widow of American businessman Allen E. Paulson and former wife of millionaire T. Boone Pickens.\n\nMadeleine Pickens was born Madeleine Baker on March 5, 1947 in Kirkuk, Iraq where her father, Bill Baker, was a British oil executive. He was also a golf course designer, who built a golf course in Kirkuk and cut down his golf clubs to teach the five-year old Madeleine to play. After her family left Iraq, Pickens grew up in France and England, where Baker designed several courses. Pickens and her twin sister Christine, both British citizens, moved from England to the Bahamas in 1965. At some point she started using the name Madeleine Farris.\n\nPickens modeled and worked as a flight attendant for Pan American Airlines in her twenties. She moved to Marina Del Rey, California in 1969 and went into business for herself, providing cabin service crews for corporate jets and special charter flights. In 1976, she was featured in an article in \"Black Belt\" magazine. She was married to Dr. Robert Richter, with whom she had a daughter, Dominique, in 1980.\n\nShe met Allen Paulson, the founder of Gulfstream Aerospace in 1983, and married him in 1988. In 1993 they bought the Del Mar Country Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, where she drew upon her background to design and build the golf course. Upon Paulson's death in 2000, she and his children from his previous marriages disputed over the estate until 2003, at which time she was awarded in the settlement, among other assets, stock in the Country Club. In September 2015, the IRS filed suit against beneficiaries of Paulson's estate, including Pickens, for unpaid estate taxes. On September 10, 2018, a judge ruled Pickens was not liable for the taxes.\n\nIn 2005, she married Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens. Not long after their marriage, the couple traveled to New Orleans to rescue pets stranded during the evacuation from Hurricane Katrina and flew them to California and Colorado on a chartered cargo jet. They divorced early in 2013.\n\nIn 2007, Pickens paid $35 million for a home on the beach in Del Mar; in 2010 she sued the city for ordering her to prune plants that were obstructing her neighbors' view. Pickens has sponsored several events at the Del Mar Country Club benefiting military organizations. In July 2016, Pickens, Jenny Craig, and Doug Manchester co-chaired a fundraiser for Donald Trump at the Del Mar Country Club in Rancho Santa Fe.\n\nPickens is said to be a lifelong equestrian. She developed an interest in thoroughbred flat racing and with Allen Paulson, she owned several race horses, including U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Cigar, which she traded to husband Allen for the filly, Eliza, the 1992 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner and that year's Eclipse Award winner as American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly.\nPickens' other horses included Fraise, who won the 1992 Breeders' Cup Turf; Yokohama winner of the 1997 Prix Foy at Longchamp Racecourse; and Rock Hard Ten, winner of the 2005 Santa Anita Handicap. Pickens and Jenny Craig owned Rock and Roll who won the 1998 Pennsylvania Derby and ran in the Kentucky Derby. Pickens also raced Miss Dominique, named for her daughter.\n\nAfter the settlement of Paulson's estate, Pickens no longer had colors to race, although she was still part owner of Rock Hard Ten and a few broodmares. She announced in June 2005 that, upon her marriage to T. Boone Pickens, her involvement with racing would be reduced. At the same time, she took up equine welfare causes when Old Friends Equine purchased Fraise and multiple Grade One winner Ogygian from their Japanese owners and she paid the $65,000 to bring them back to retirement at the Old Friends facility in Georgetown, Kentucky. About a year after their marriage, the couple led the fight to close the last horse slaughterhouse in the United States. The slaughterhouses were closed due to Congress's prohibiting funds to pay inspectors in the year appropriations bills, but the Pickens worked for a more permanent solution by lobbying Congress to pass the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act (AHSPA), which passed in the United States House of Representatives, but not in the Senate (In 2015, the AHSPA was folded into the proposed Safeguard American Food Exports Act.). In recognition of their efforts, in 2007 Madeleine and Boone Pickens received the Equine Advocates' Safe Home Equine Protection Award. \nIn the summer of 2008, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), was faced with a budget crisis in its free-roaming horse program due to the cost of maintaining 33,000 excess (unadopted) horses captured on public lands in holding facilities. The agency was considering implementing the options that Congress had provided for in amendments to the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, to either euthanize or sell the horses \"without limitation\" to any willing buyer Since \"any willing buyer\" included those that would send the horses to slaughter in foreign countries, Pickens established \"The National Wild Horse Foundation,\" to create a sanctuary for excess horses. On November 21, 2008, Pickens was named Person of the Week by ABC News due to her announcement that she would adopt and maintain, with private funds, all 33,000 horses at the sanctuary. However, shortly thereafter she stated that the recession forced many of the donors she hoped would help her pay for the venture backed out, and she requested the BLM pay her a yearly stipend of $500 per horse to maintain the horses. The BLM responded that it was not possible to enter into the contract she requested.\n\nIn January, 2010, Pickens hired three helicopters to view and photograph a BLM horse gather, and at one point they flew across the flight path of other helicopters being used to herd animals, leading to the accusation she had interfered with the gather. A year later, a $500,000 float she sponsored for the Tournament of Roses Parade depicted a Native American on a horse watching over several galloping horses. The day before the parade, the National Tribal Horse Coalition issued a news release objecting to the float for using \"the symbolism of the North American Indians and horses to promote agendas in direct opposition to the tribes' position.\"\n\nAlso in 2010, Pickens purchased property in Elko County in northeast Nevada; the 14,000 acre Spruce Ranch in the remote Goshute Valley for $2,570,000. Shortly afterwards. she purchased the Warm Creek Ranch which is located about 25 miles south of Wells, Nevada on Highway 93, adjacent to the northwest boundary of the 508,000 acre BLM Spruce Mountain grazing allotment. In March 2011, the BLM put out invitations for Pickens and others who wished to provide lands to maintain horses for the BLM in \"Eco_Sanctuaries\" to submit proposals for evaluation. \"Saving America's Mustangs\" the formerly named National Wild Horse Foundation to which Pickens had transferred title to the Spruce Ranch, submitted a proposal to maintain horses, that the BLM agreed to evaluate in April 2012. In August 2012, the BLM published the proposal in the Federal Register but in June 2014 the evaluation stalled after scoping found issues that have yet to resolved. Although she has purchased several hundred horses at risk of slaughter and maintains them on the private lands of the ranches, in 2014 Saving America's Mustangs leased the Spruce Allotment grazing permit to the \"Spruce Grazing Association\" that instead grazes cows. On December 21, 2017, the BLM announced it would be rounding up horses in the area of the Spruce allotment. On August 25, 2018, the BLM announced an emergency gather of 300 horses at Boone Spring within the allotment. \n\nInitially the Warm Creek Ranch headquarters was slated to be used as the \"base of operations\" for the eco-sanctuary. However, on September 11, 2012, Pickens made reference to plans for a luxury resort called the \"Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco-Resort\". Pickens began converting the headquarters for the resort, and began renovating the old ranchhouse there to become a dining hall and kitchen. On April 3, 2013, the Elko County Commission approved a liquor license for venture, and Pickens spent a million dollars on \"Safari Tents\" or Tee Pees for the guests. The eco-resort was open for business in the summer of 2014 and, among other things, offered horseback rides on BLM-administered public lands and using a road crossing BLM administered lands to the Spruce Ranch to take guests to see the horses kept there. Pickens states she was informed by the BLM in December of that year that she would need a permit to use the road and public lands for her commercial ventures and that she filed the application for the permit. Pickens claims that in October 2015 the BLM told her the paperwork had been misplaced, and her representative claims that the BLM requested trivial information to process the application. Also, Elko County officials determined that the food preparation facilities she planned did not meet the County health and safety codes, and required her to install a commercial kitchen. By February, 2016 the BLM had not finished processing the permit application and the County's safety codes had not yet been met. The County required Pickens to, in case of fire, to put sprinkler systems in the lavishly furnished teepees, and because the town of Wells had, in 2008, suffered a major earthquake, she was required to modify the walk-in cooler in the kitchen to be earthquake proof. Pickens issued a press release on February 10, 2016, stating the resort would not open for 2016, but although the Mustang Monument website stated she hoped to open in 2017 and having spent $25 million on the venture, she stated on September 1, 2016, she was \"out of it\" and would sell the Tee Pees. George Knapp, an investigative reporter for a Las Vegas television station, reported that Pickens said that she had made a bad decision and she would not spend more money on the venture. The webpage for Mustang Monument announced the facility was closed in 2016 and was not updated since.\n\nPickens stated that her problems with acquiring the BLM permit are due to her being \"a tall tree\" that \"catch(es) the wind.\" Pickens' representative suggested the real reasons for Elko County's safety requirements were due to local hostility to a wild horse sanctuary and because Pickens was from California, and Knapp, a Coast to Coast AM host that had Pickens' representative on as a guest in 2012, expanded upon that to imply that they were imposed because Pickens was \"rich, blonde, female, and...from California.\" Adding to the conflicts in 2016, a lawsuit against Saving America's Mustangs and the Del Mar Country Club was filed for an alleged racially motivated hostile work environment at the Country Club and Mustang Monument in 2014. As of January 2017, that lawsuit was pending.\n\n"}

She played major roles as a grassroot and nationalist politician in the Eastern Nigerian city of Aba, in the era of an hierarchical and male-dominated movement towards independence, with her rise not the least helped by the socialization of women's role into that of helpmates or appendages to the careers of males.\n\nMargaret Ekpo was born in Creek Town, Cross River State, to the family of Okoroafor Obiasulor and Inyang Eyo Aniemewue. She reached standard six of the school leaving certificate in 1934. However, tragedy struck at home with the death of her father in 1934, her goals of further education in teachers training was as a result put on hold. She then started working as a pupil teacher in elementary schools. She married a doctor, John Udo Ekpo, in 1938. He was from the Ibibio ethnic group who are predominant in Akwa Ibom State, while she was of Igbo and Efik heritage. She later moved with her husband to Aba.\n\nIn 1946, she had the opportunity to study abroad at what is now Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Ireland. She earned a diploma in domestic science and on her return to Nigeria she established a Domestic Science and Sewing Institute in Aba.\n\nMargaret Ekpo's first direct participation in political ideas and association was in 1945. Her husband was indignant with the colonial administrators treatment of indigenous Nigerian doctors but as a civil servant, he could not attend meetings to discuss the matter. Margaret Ekpo then attended meetings in place of her husband, the meetings were organized to discuss the discriminatory practices of the colonial administration in the city and to fight cultural and racial imbalance in administrative promotions. She later attended a political rally and was the only woman at the rally, which saw fiery speeches from Mbonu Ojike, Nnamdi Azikiwe and Herbert Macaulay. By the end of the decade she had organized a Market Women Association in Aba to unionize market women in the city. She used the association to promote women solidarity as a platform to fight for the economic rights of women, economic protections and expansionary political rights of women.\n\nMargaret Ekpo's awareness of growing movements for civil rights for women around the world prodded her into demanding the same for the women in her country and to fight the discriminatory and oppressive political and civil role colonialism played in the subjugation of women. She felt that women abroad including those in Britain, were already fighting for civil rights and had more voice in political and civil matters than their counterparts in Nigeria. She later joined the decolonization-leading National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NGNC), as a platform to represent a marginalized group. In the 1950s, she also teamed up with Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti to protest killings at an Enugu coal mine; the victims were leaders protesting colonial practices at the mine. In 1953, Ekpo was nominated by the NGNC to the regional House of Chiefs, and in 1954 she established the Aba Township Women's Association. As leader of the new market group, she was able to garner the trust of a large number of women in the township and turn it into a political pressure group. By 1955, women in Aba had outnumbered men voters in a citywide election.\n\nShe won a seat to the Eastern Regional House of Assembly in 1961, a position that allowed her to fight for issues affecting women at the time. In particular, there were issues on the progress of women in economic and political matters, especially in the areas of transportation around major roads leading to markets and rural transportation in general.\n\nAfter a military coup ended the First Republic, she took a less prominent approach to politics. In 2001, Calabar Airport was named after her.\n"}

The account of his stay at the Cape from 12 March to 7 July 1825, \"De vruchten mijner werkzaamheden\" (fruits of my labours), was a thorough description of his trip, rich in interesting detail of the personalities and places he came across, and thoughtful commentary on the social, political and economic life of the Cape colony.\n\nDespite this being his first published attempt at writing, the artless manner in which he set down his observations on language, habits and customs, modes of transport, farming practices and the appearance of the countryside, must rank this as one of the finest travelogues on the Cape. Besides trying the restorative waters of the Caledon baths, he visited Genadendal Mission, Franschhoek and Stellenbosch.\n\nTeenstra belonged to a prosperous Frisian farming family, and was the son of Douwe Martens Teenstra and Jantje Luies Dijkhuis. In 1819 his father bought him the 100ha farm \"Arion\" for the sum of 100 000 guilders. The collapsing agricultural market caused widespread financial losses, and led to his 1824 decision to temporarily abandon farming, his wife and his children, and to leave for Java aboard a swift frigate named \"Abel Tasman\".\n\nLife aboard the ship was comfortable with excellent fare, often consisting of seven or eight dishes, wine, music and singing after supper, and the odd game of cards, checkers or chess. In the equatorial latitudes, though, the heat was oppressive, especially at night, when the mingled odours of cheese, ham and unwashed bodies from the hold, forced passengers to sleep on deck. Teenstra, together with 33 others who had not crossed the equator previously, were subjected to the ceremony of \"crossing the line\".\n\nAfter a voyage lasting sixty-one days via Madeira, the Canary Islands and Trinidad, their ship anchored in Table Bay on 11 March 1825. Teenstra was feeling decidedly unwell, a condition he put down to a freak squall's having drenched him while he was enjoying a bath. In this fragile state he spent a few weeks in the company of his landlady, Miss Truter and her family members, who by horse and buggy introduced him to Cape Town and the Peninsula.\n\nHis next letter was dated 1 May 1825 and was written from Caledon, a source of mineral-rich hot springs where he \"took the waters\" on the advice of his doctor, his ship having left for Batavia while he underwent an enforced convalescence.\n\nTeenstra returned to his family in 1826 and soon realised that agricultural prospects had not improved during his absence. Consequently he sold his farm and moved to Baflo with his family, from where he wrote most of his travel books. Again, he found himself in financial trouble and in 1828 moved to Surinam, at that time one of the Dutch colonies. Here he became an agricultural advisor and was soon appointed as inspector of bridges, roads and waterworks. Over this period his wife and children were living in Ulrum in a house built by his mother-in-law.\n\nTeenstra returned to the Netherlands in 1834, bought a house in Ulrum and settled in to write, producing children's, travel and history books, and establishing two magazines. He attended the Mennonite church and was a member of the Freemasons.\n\n"}
{"id": "583867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=583867", "title": "Max Cavalera", "text": "Max Cavalera\n\nMassimiliano Antonio \"Max\" Cavalera (, born August 4, 1969) is a Brazilian singer, guitarist, and songwriter who currently plays in heavy metal bands Soulfly, Cavalera Conspiracy, and Killer Be Killed. In 1984, he co-founded the acclaimed thrash metal band Sepultura with his brother Igor Cavalera and was the band's lead singer and rhythm guitarist until he left in 1996. Cavalera was also involved in a short-lived side project called Nailbomb.\n\nMax Cavalera's father, Graziano Cavalera, was an employee of the Italian Consulate in Belo Horizonte. He died at 41 years of age; Cavalera was nine when his father died. Cavalera's family was in a state of financial crisis and family turbulence when he formed Sepultura with his younger brother Igor. In the early 1990s, he relocated to Phoenix, Arizona. He did not begin to make spiritual music until after he quit Sepultura. His earlier lyrics for Soulfly were influenced by religion and spirituality, though he is critical of religion. His later albums, starting with \"Dark Ages\", began to incorporate lyrical themes of violence, warfare, anger and hatred. His albums have all been dedicated to God, and he has often been depicted by the press as a man of religion, especially in the United States, something that Cavalera himself says he does not understand:\n\nI do hate a lot of \"religion\", but people like Christ – yeah they inspire me. I mean if you look at Christ, He was hanging around with the lowlifes, prostitutes and the losers you know, not going around with those high society motherfuckers you see trying to sell Jesus today!\n\nWhen asked in an interview whether he was a Christian and whether Soulfly was a Christian band, he said:\n\nNo. I mean, if I was a Christian I would wear all these different kinds of omens. Because Christian people are so close-minded. A priest would not accept that. So I don't like the concept of Christianity in terms of being so close-minded. It is the same with music. Sometimes I compare preachers to close-minded musicians or close-minded listeners, who only like one kind of music. Some preachers are the same. And they don't tolerate Hindus, Buddhists or whatever. Only them. It's bullshit. So Soulfly is not a Christian band at all. Very much opposite. But we are very spiritual. Spiritual has nothing to do with Christianity anyway. It has been here since the beginning of time.\n\nIn another interview, he was asked about the Varg Vikernes church burnings. He quoted, \"I support church burnings 100 percent, but why don't we just burn everything. Mosques, temples, all religious buildings.\" However, he later claimed his views changed about the church burnings and called them \"too violent\". He has stated that he does believe in God, \"But it might be different than the God the preacher preaches about.\"\n\nOf enduring influence to his music, is the untimely death of his stepson, Dana Wells, who was killed after the release of \"Roots\" in 1996. The songs \"Bleed\", \"First Commandment\", \"Pain\", \"Tree of Pain\" and \"Revengeance\" are tributes to Wells, as well as Deftones' song \"Headup\", in which Cavalera featured and co-wrote. He reunited with his brother Igor, in their band Cavalera Conspiracy, and wrote and performed on Soulfly's \"Conquer\", released in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Cavalera appears in \"\" as himself on radio station LCHC.\n\nIn 2013, Cavalera released his autobiography, titled \"My Bloody Roots\"; his co-writer was the British author Joel McIver and the book's foreword was written by Dave Grohl.\n\nCavalera has lived in Phoenix, Arizona, since 1992 with his wife Gloria (b. 1953) and his five children, Zyon (b. January 19, 1993), Igor (b. July 2, 1995), Jason (b. December 1, 1986), Richie (b. August 25, 1985) and Roxanne (b. November 14, 1983). The three eldest, Gloria's children, were adopted by Cavalera, making Cavalera their legal father. Zyon, Igor and Richie have all collaborated with Cavalera in his various projects. Three of his sons are also active in music, with Richie fronting Incite and Igor and Zyon performing in Lody Kong. Jason tours as Zyon's drum tech, amongst other various duties behind the scenes. In 2012 and 2013, Zyon toured with Soulfly after David Kinkade's retirement, and now he is a regular member as drummer. Igor briefly filled in as bassist for Soulfly in 2015 after Tony Campos left the band, and toured as keyboardist and co-vocalist during Soulfly's \"Point Blank\" Tour. Igor was born with type 1 diabetes, and Max and Gloria set up the Iggy Fund in 1998 to help other families get necessary medicine for their children with juvenile diabetes.\n\nCavalera has collaborated with many different artists while in Sepultura and Soulfly. In 2003 he joined forces with former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters' frontman Dave Grohl to produce \"Red War\" for the self-titled release of Dave Grohl's metal project, Probot.\n\nCavalera has worked with the following musicians:\n\nCavalera appeared in \"The Scorpion King\" in an off-camera role, providing the guttural screams for Dwayne Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "652127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=652127", "title": "Mexicans", "text": "Mexicans\n\nMexicans () are the people of the United Mexican States, a multiethnic country in North America. Mexicans can also be those who identify with the Mexican cultural or national identity.\n\nThe Mexica founded Mexico-Tenochtitlan in 1325 as an \"altepetl\" (city-state) located on an island in Lake Texcoco, in the Valley of Mexico. It became the capital of the expanding Mexica Empire in the 15th century, until captured by the Spanish in 1521. At its peak, it was the largest city in the Pre-Columbian Americas. It subsequently became a \"cabecera\" of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Today the ruins of Tenochtitlan are located in the central part of Mexico City.\n\nThe modern nation of Mexico achieved independence from the Spanish Empire; this began the process of forging a national identity that fused the cultural traits of indigenous pre-Columbian origin with those of European, particularly Iberian, ancestry. This led to what has been termed \"a peculiar form of multi-ethnic nationalism\".\n\nThe most spoken language by Mexicans is Mexican Spanish, but some may also speak languages from 68 different indigenous linguistic groups and other languages brought to Mexico by recent immigration or learned by Mexican immigrants residing in other nations. In 2015, 21.5% of Mexico's population self-identified as being Indigenous or partially Indigenous. There are about 12 million Mexican nationals residing outside Mexico, with about 11.7 million living in the United States. The larger Mexican diaspora can also include individuals that trace ancestry to Mexico and self-identify as Mexican.\n\nThe Mexican people have varied origins and an identity that has evolved with the succession of conquests among Amerindian groups and later by Europeans. The area that is now modern-day Mexico has cradled many predecessor civilizations, going back as far as the Olmec which influenced the latter civilizations of Teotihuacan (200 B.C. to 700 A.D.) and the much debated Toltec people who flourished around the 10th and 12th centuries A.D., and ending with the last great indigenous civilization before the Spanish Conquest, the Aztecs (13 March 1325 to 13 August 1521). The Nahuatl language was a common tongue in the region of modern Central Mexico during the Aztec Empire, but after the arrival of Europeans the common language of the region became Spanish.\n\nAfter the conquest of the Aztec empire, the Spanish re-administered the land and expanded their own empire beyond the former boundaries of the Aztec, adding more territory to the Mexican sphere of influence which remained under the Spanish Crown for 300 years. Cultural diffusion and intermixing among the Amerindian populations with the European created the modern Mexican identity which is a mixture of regional indigenous and European cultures that evolved into a national culture during the Spanish period. This new identity was defined as \"Mexican\" shortly after the Mexican War of Independence and was more invigorated and developed after the Mexican Revolution when the Constitution of 1917 officially established Mexico as an indivisible pluricultural nation founded on its indigenous roots.\n\n\"Mexicano\" (Mexican) is derived from the word \"Mexico\" itself. In the principal model to create demonyms in Spanish, the suffix \"-ano\" is added to the name of the place of origin.\n\nIt has been suggested that the name of the country is derived from Mextli or Mēxihtli, a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Mexicas, Huitzilopochtli, in which case Mēxihco means \"Place where Huitzilopochtli lives\". Another hypothesis suggests that \"Mēxihco\" derives from the Nahuatl words for \"Moon\" (\"Mētztli\") and navel (\"xīctli\"). This meaning (\"Place at the Center of the Moon\") might then refer to Tenochtitlan's position in the middle of Lake Texcoco. The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the Moon. Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from Mēctli, the goddess of maguey.\n\nThe term \"Mexicano\" as a word to describe the different peoples of the region of Mexico as a single group emerged in the 16th century. In that time the term did not apply to a nationality nor to the geographical limits of the modern Mexican Republic. The term was used for the first time in the first document printed in Barcelona in 1566 which documented the expedition which launched from the port in Acapulco to find the best route which would favor a return journey from the Spanish East Indies to New Spain. The document stated: \"el venturoso descubrimiento que los Mexicanos han hecho\" (the venturous discovery that the Mexicans have made). That discovery led to the Manila galleon trade route and those \"Mexicans\" referred to Criollos, Mestizos and Amerindians alluding to a plurality of persons who participated for a common end: the conquest of the Philippines in 1565. (Gómez M., et al. 56)\n\nA large majority of Mexicans have been classified as \"Mestizos\", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a Spanish cultural heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating elements from indigenous and Spanish traditions. By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments the \"Mestizo identity\" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as \"mestizaje\" . Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje.\n\nSince the Mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity than a biological one it has achieved a strong influence in the country, with a good number of biologically white people identifying with it, leading to being considered Mestizos in Mexico's demographic investigations and censuses due the ethnic criteria having its base on cultural traits rather than biological ones. A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos: while the term \"Mestizo\" is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood, this usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure Indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language, and a person with none or a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage. In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo has a different meaning, with it being to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the caste war of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as Mestizos. In Chiapas the word \"Ladino\" is used instead of mestizo.\nCultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to \"help\" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.\n\nGiven that the word Mestizo has different meanings in Mexico, estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely. According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", which uses a biology-based approach, between one half and two thirds of the Mexican population is Mestizo. A culture-based estimate gives the percentage of Mestizos as high as 90%. Paradoxically, the word Mestizo has long been dropped from popular Mexican vocabulary, with the word even having pejorative connotations, which further complicates attempts to quantify Mestizos via self-identification.\n\nWhile for most of its history the concept of Mestizo and Mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico's intellectual circles, in recent times the concept has been target of criticism, with its detractors claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of \"(Racism) Not existing here (Mexico), as everybody is Mestizo\" the Mestizo ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico. In general, the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole.\n\nEuropean Mexicans are Mexican citizens of full or majoritarily European descent. Europeans began arriving in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire; and while during the colonial period most European immigration was Spanish, in the 19th and 20th centuries European and European-derived populations from North and South America did immigrate to the country. According to 20th and 21st century academics, large scale intermixing between the European immigrants and the native Indigenous peoples would produce a Mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of Mexico's population by the time of Independence. However according to church registers from the colonial times, the majority (73%) of Spanish men married with Spanish women. Said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics, such as European immigrants who arrived to Mexico being almost exclusively men or that \"pure Spanish\" people were all part of a small powerful elite, as Spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities and there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete Spanish origin.\n\nEstimates of Mexico's white population differ greatly in both, methodology and percentages given, extra-official sources such as the World factbook and Encyclopedia Brittanica, which use the 1921 census results as the base of their estimations calculate Mexico's White population as only 9% or between one tenth to one fifth (the results of the 1921 census, however, have been contested by various historians and deemed innaccurate). Surveys that account for phenotypical traits and have performed actual field research suggest rather higher percentages: using the presence of blond hair as reference to classify a Mexican as white, the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the percentage of said ethnic group at 23%. With a similar methodology, the American Sociological Association obtained a percentage of 18.8% having its higher frequency on the North region (22.3%–23.9%) followed by the Center region (18.4%–21.3%) and the South region (11.9%). Another study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are of 18% and 28% respectively, surveys that use as reference skin color such as those made by Mexico's National Council to Prevent Discrimination and Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported a percentages of 47% in 2010 and 49% in 2017 respectivelly. Another survey published in 2018 reported a percentage significativelly lower at 29%, this time however, the surveying of Mexicans from \"vulnerable groups\" was prioritized, which among other measures meant that states known to have high numbers of people from said groups surveyed more people. \n\nMexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European population, with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry, resembling in aspect that of northern Spaniards. In the north and west of Mexico, the indigenous tribes were substantially smaller than those found in central and southern Mexico, and also much less organized, thus they remained isolated from the rest of the population or even in some cases were hostile towards Mexican colonists. The northeast region, in which the indigenous population was eliminated by early European settlers, became the region with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish colonial period. However, recent immigrants from southern Mexico have been changing, to some degree, its demographic trends.\n\nThe White population of central Mexico, despite not being as numerous as in the north due to higher mixing, is ethnically more diverse, as there are large numbers of other European and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, aside from Spaniards. This also results in non-Iberian surnames (mostly French, German, Italian and Arab) being more common in central Mexico, especially in the country's capital and in the state of Jalisco.\n\nThe 2003 General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples recognizes 62 indigenous languages as \"national languages\" which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken. The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the 1980s.\n\nThe category of \"indigena\" (indigenous) in Mexico has been defined based on different criteria through history, this means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as \"indigenous\" varies according to the definition applied. It can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak an indigenous language, based on this criteria approximately 5.4% of the population is Indigenous. Nonetheless, activists for the rights of indigenous peoples have referred to the usage of this criteria for census purposes as \"statistical genocide\"\n\nOther surveys made by the Mexican government do count as Indigenous all persons who speak an indigenous language and people who do not speak indigenous languages nor live in indigenous communities but self-identifies as Indigenous. According to this criteria, the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography), state that there are 15.7 million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups, which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country.\n\nAccording to the latest intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government on 2015, Indigenous people make up 21.5% of Mexico's population. In this occasion, people who self-identified as \"Indigenous\" and people who self-identified as \"partially Indigenous\" were classified in the \"Indigenous\" category altogether.\n\nThe absolute indigenous population is growing, but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples is nonetheless falling. The majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central-southern and south-eastern states, with the majority of the indigenous population living in rural areas. Some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of \"usos y costumbres\", which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law.\n\nAccording to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are Yucatán, with 62.7%, Quintana Roo with 33.8% and Campeche with 32% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 58% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 32.7%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 30.1%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 25.2%, and Guerrero with 22.6%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potosí and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.\n\nAn Arab Mexican is a Mexican citizen of Arabic-speaking origin who can be of various ancestral origins. The vast majority of Mexico's 1.1 million Arabs are from either Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, or Palestinian background.\n\nThe interethnic marriage in the Arab community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the Arab community in Mexico shows marked language shift away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic, and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak Spanish as a first language. Today, the most common Arabic surnames in Mexico include Nader, Hayek, Ali, Haddad, Nasser, Malik, Abed, Mansoor, Harb and Elias.\n\nArab immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They came mostly from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq and settled in significant numbers in Nayarit, Puebla, Mexico City and the Northern part of the country (mainly in the states of Baja California, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango, as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara. The term \"Arab Mexican\" may include ethnic groups that do not in fact identify as Arab.\n\nDuring the Israel-Lebanon war in 1948 and during the Six-Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico. They first arrived in Veracruz. Although Arabs made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.\n\nImmigration of Arabs in Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, where they have introduced Kibbeh, Tabbouleh and even created recipes such as \"Tacos Árabes\". By 1765, Dates, which originated from the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards. The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the Yucatecan cuisine.\n\nAnother concentration of Arab-Mexicans is in Baja California facing the U.S.-Mexican border, esp. in cities of Mexicali in the Imperial Valley U.S./Mexico, and Tijuana across from San Diego with a large Arab American community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico. 45% of Arab Mexicans are of Lebanese descent.\n\nThe majority of Arab-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches. A scant number are Muslims and Jews of Middle Eastern origins.\n\nAfro-Mexicans are an ethnic group that predominate in certain areas of Mexico. Such as the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero, Veracruz (e.g. Yanga) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of blacks in Mexico is unknown, denied or diminished in both Mexico and abroad for a number of reasons: their small numbers, heavy intermarriage with other ethnic groups and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a \"mestizaje\" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade since the early Spanish period but from the beginning, intermarriage and mixed race offspring created an elaborate caste system. This system broke down in the very late Spanish period and after Independence the legal notion of race was eliminated. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.\n\nThe majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are \"Afromestizos\", i.e. \"mixed-race\". Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 1.2% of Mexico's population, the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of indigenous languages.\n\nAsian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern Mexico, nonetheless they are a notable minority. Due to the historical and contemporary perception in Mexican society of what constitutes Asian culture (associated with the Far East rather than the Near East), Asian Mexicans are of East, South and Southeast Asian descent and Mexicans of West Asian descent are not considered to be part of the group.\n\nAsian immigration began with the arrival of Filipinos to Mexico during the Spanish period. For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from Mexico and the Philippines as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon assisting Spain in its trade between Asia and the Americas. Also on these voyages, thousands of Asian individuals (mostly males) were brought to Mexico as slaves and were called \"Chino\", which meant Chinese. Although in reality they were of diverse origins, including Japanese, Koreans, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Cambodians, Timorese, and people from Bengal, India, Ceylon, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate, and China. A notable example is the story of Catarina de San Juan (Mirra), an Indian girl captured by the Portuguese and sold into slavery in Manila. She arrived in New Spain and eventually she gave rise to the \"China Poblana\".\n\nThese early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread \"mestizaje\" of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of \"Chino\" slaves to \"pass\" as \"Indios\" (the indigenous people of Mexico) in order to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general Mestizo population. Facilitating this miscegenation was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from chattel slavery, and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.\n\nAsians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.\n\nEthnic relations in modern Mexico have grown out of the historical context of the arrival of Europeans, the subsequent Spanish period of cultural and genetic miscegenation within the frame work of the castas system, the revolutionary periods focus on incorporating all ethnic and racial group into a common Mexican national identity and the indigenous revival of the late 20th century. The resulting picture has been called \"a peculiar form of multi-ethnic nationalism\".\n\nVery generally speaking ethnic relations can be arranged on an axis between the two extremes of European and Amerindian cultural heritage, this is a remnant of the Spanish caste system which categorized individuals according to their perceived level of biological mixture between the two groups. Additionally the presence of considerable portions of the population with partly African and Asian heritage further complicates the situation. Even though it still arranges persons along the line between indigenous and European, in practice the classificatory system is no longer biologically based, but rather mixes socio-cultural traits with phenotypical traits, and classification is largely fluid, allowing individuals to move between categories and define their ethnic and racial identities situationally.\n\nHistorically, population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico's require. The first racial census was made in 1793, being also Mexico's (then known as New Spain) first ever nationwide population census. Of it, only part of the original datasets survive. Thus most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who used the census' findings as reference for their own works. More than a century would pass until the Mexican government conducted a new racial census in 1921 (some sources assert that the census of 1895 included a comprehensive racial classification, however according to the historic archives of Mexico's National Institute of Statistics that was not the case). While the 1921 census was the last time the Mexican government conducted a census that included a comprehensive racial classification, in recent time it has conducted nationwide surveys to quantify most of the ethnic groups who inhabit the country as well as the social dynamics and inequalities between them.\n\nAlso known as the \"Revillagigedo census\" due to its creation being ordered by the Count of the same name, this census was Mexico's (then known as the Viceroyalty of New Spain) first ever nationwide population census. Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, thus most of what is now known about it comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary much, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos ranging from 21% to 25%, Indians ranging from 51% to 61% and Africans being between 6,000 and 10,000, The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%-17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates, due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or being at war with them. It is also for these reasons that the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greater variation range between publications, as in cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.\n~\n\nRegardless of the possible imprecisions related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put on considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens/subjects, as example the censuses made by the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements. Other example would be the censuses made by the United States, that did not include Indigenous peoples living among the general population until 1860, and indigenous peoples as a whole until 1900.\n\nMade right after the consumation of the Mexican revolution, the social context on which this census was made makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking forward to unite all Mexicans under a single national identity. The 1921 census' final results in regards to race, which assert that 59.3% of the Mexican population self-identified as Mestizo, 29.1% as Indigenous and only 9.8% as White were then essential to cement the \"mestizaje\" ideology (that asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races) which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the 20th century and remain prominent nowadays, with extraofficial international publications such as \"The World Factbook\" and Encyclopædia Britannica using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day.\n\nNonetheless in recent times the census' results have been subjected to scrutiny by historians, academics and social activists alike, who assert that such drastic alterations on demographic trends with respect to the 1793 census are not possible and cite, among other statistics, the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico. It is claimed that the \"mestizaje\" process sponsored by the state was more \"cultural than biological\" which resulted on the numbers of the Mestizo Mexican group being inflated at the expense of the identity of other races. Controversies aside, this census constituted the last time the Mexican Government conducted a comprehensive racial census with the breakdown by states being the following (foreigners and people who answered \"other\" not included):\n\nWhen the 1921 census' results are compared with the results of Mexico's recent censuses as well as with modern genetic research, high consistence is found in regards to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country, with states located in south and south-eastern Mexico having both, the highest percentages of population that self-identifies as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry. However this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans, as there are instances on which states that have been shown to have a considerably high European ancestry per scientific research are reported to have very small white populations in the 1921 census, with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango, where the aforementioned census asserts that only 0.01% of the state's population (33 persons) self-identified as \"white\" while modern scientific research shows that the population of Durango has similar genetic frequences to those found on European peoples (with the state's Indigenous population showing almost no foreign admixture either). Various authors theorize that the reason for these inconsistencies may lie in the Mestizo identity promoted by the Mexican government, which reportedly led to people who are not biologically Mestizos to identify as such.\n\nThe following table is a compilation of (when possible) official nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexican government who have attempted to quantify different Mexican ethnic groups. Given that for the most part each ethnic group was estimated by different surveys, with different methodologies and years apart rather than on a single comprehensive racial census, some groups could overlap with others and be overestimated or underestimated.\n\nOf all the ethnic groups that have been surveyed Mestizos are notably absent, which is likely due to the label's fluid and subjective definition, which complicates its precise quantification. However, it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. As example the 2015 intercensal survey considered as Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether individuals who self-identified as \"part Indigenous\" or \"part African\" thus, said people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits/appearance, thus technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his/her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally, the remaining ethnicities, for being of a rather low number or being faiths have more permissive classification criteria, therefore a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to said ethnicities.\n\nNonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of \"race\" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one and to society's eyes a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered \"white\" and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered \"Indian\", a person that identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically he doesn't completely belong to that group.\n\nGenetic studies in Mexico can be divided on three groups: studies made on self-identified Mestizos, studies made on Indigenous peoples and studies made on the general Mexican population, studies that focus on Eurodescendant Mexicans or Afro-Mexicans have not been made. Mexicans who self-identify as Mestizos are primarily of European and Native American ancestry. The third largest component is African, a legacy of the slavery in New Spain (which saw the importation of some 100,000 to 200,000 black slaves). However, geneticists theorize that in regions of Mexico that did not have any presence of slaves, traces of African ancestry might have come from Spanish colonists and not African slaves themselves, as said ancestry is of North African and Near East origin. Depending on the region, some may have small traces of Asian admixture due the thousands of Filipinos and \"Chinos\" (Asian slaves of diverse origin, not just Chinese) that arrived on the \"Nao de China\". More recent Asian immigration (specifically Chinese) may help explain the comparatively high Asian contribution in Northwest Mexico (i.e., Sonora).\n\nAccording to numerous studies, on average, the largest genetic component of Mexicans who self-identify as being Mestizos is indigenous; although the difference in incidence between the indigenous and european composites is relatively small, both representing well over 40% of the genetic composition of mestizos. In studies made on the general Mexican population (this is, studies where there is no other kind of self-identification than that of being \"Mexican\") the European ancestral genetic component tends to overtake the indigenous composite. Said increase is the most pronounced on research done on chromosomal maternal ancestry, as while in studies made on self identified Mestizos the European maternal ancestry is as low as only 5%, on studies done on the general Mexican population the European maternal ancestry increases more than 40 points, with it being 46%, suggesting that nowadays a considerable segment of Mexico's population is left out when a study uses as samples only people who think of themselves as being Mestizos. Genetic studies made on indigenous Mexicans reveal a predominant indigenous ancestry but with higher than expected variations on European and African ancestral components. Extant research suggests that geographic location plays a more significative role on determining the genetic makeup of the average Indigenous person than cultural traits do, an example of this is the indigenous population of Tlapa in the state of Guerrero that despite for the most part speaking Spanish and having the same cultural customs non-indigenous Mexicans have, shows an indigenous ancestry of 95%. In contrast, Nahua-speaking Indigenous peoples from the state of Veracruz have a mean European ancestry of 42% and an African ancestry of 22%.\n\nThe Mestizaje ideology, which has blurred the lines of race at an institutional level has also had a significative influence in genetic studies done in Mexico: As the criteria used in studies to determine if a Mexican is Mestizo or indigenous often lies in cultural traits such as the language spoken instead of racial self-identification or a phenotype-based selection there are studies on which populations who are considered to be Indigenous per virtue of the language spoken show a higher degree of European genetic admixture than the one populations considered to be Mestizo report in other studies. The opposite also happens, as there instances on which populations considered to be Mestizo show genetic frequencies very similar to continental European peoples in the case of Mestizos from the state of Durango or to European derived Americans in the case of Mestizos from the state of Jalisco.\n\nA 2006 study conducted by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN), which genotyped 104 samples, reported that mestizo Mexicans are 58.96% European, 35.05% \"Asian\" (primarily Amerindian), and 5.03% Other. Of the six states that participated in the Study, the state of Sonora showed the highest European ancestry being approximately 70% while the State of Guerrero presented the lowest European ancestry, at around 50%.\n\nAccording to a 2009 report by the Mexican Genome Project, which sampled 300 Mexicans who self-identified as Mestizos from six Mexican states and one indigenous group, the gene pool of the Mexicans population was calculated to be 55.2% percent indigenous, 41.8% European, 1.0% African, and 1.2% Asian.\n\nAn autosomal study performed in Mestizos from Mexico's three largest cities reported that Mestizos from Mexico city had an average ancestry of 50% European, 1% African and 49% Amerindian whereas Mestizos from the cities of Monterrey and Guadalajara had both a European ancestry of 60% and an indigenous ancestry of 40% in average.\n\nAn autosomal study performed in Mexicans from the states of Nuevo Leon, Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi found the average indigenous ancestry to be 22% while 78% of the genetic ancestry was of Spanish/European origin.\n\nAn autosomal study performed in Mexico City reported that Mexican mestizos' mean ancestry was 57% European, 40% Amerindian and 3% African.\n\nAdditional studies suggests a tendency relating a higher European admixture with a higher socioeconomic status and a higher Amerindian ancestry with a lower socioeconomic status: a study made exclusively on low income Mestizos residing in Mexico City found the mean admixture to be 0.590, 0.348, and 0.062 for Amerindian, European and African respectively whereas the European admixture increased to an average of around 70% on mestizos belonging to a higher socioeconomical level.\n\nAn autosomal genetic study which included the states of Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Queretaro and Mexico City determined the average ancestry of the central region of Mexico to be 52% European 39% Amerindian, and 9% African. \n\nAn autosomal genetic study performed in the town of Metztitlan in the state of Hidalgo reported that the average genetic ancestry of the town's autochthonous (indigenous) population was 64% Amerindian, 25% European and 11% African.\n\nA 2012 study published by the \"Journal of Human Genetics\" Y chromosomes found the deep paternal ancestry of the Mexican mestizo population to be predominately European (64.9%), followed by Amerindian (30.8%) and Asian(1.2%). The European Y chromosome was more prevalent in the north and west (66.7-95%) and Native American ancestry increased in the center and southeast (37-50%), the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous (0-8.8%). The states that participated in this study where Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Yucatán. The largest amount of chromosomes found were identified as belonging to the haplogroups from Western Europe, East Europe and Eurasia, Siberia and the Americas and Northern Europe with relatively smaller traces of haplogroups from Central Asia, South-east Asia, South-central Asia, Western Asia, The Caucasus, North Africa, Near East, East Asia, North-east Asia, South-west Asia and the Middle East.\n\nAlbeit not as numerous or with a history as long as genetic research in the country, studies regarding the presence of different phenotypical traits (hair color, hair shape, eye color etc.) in Mexicans have been made. Those studies have recently gained the attention of Mexico's government which has begun conducting its own nationwide investigations, with the aim of document dynamics and inequalities on interactions between Mexicans of different ethnicities/races as well as to have a more concise idea of the ethnic composition of the country (a field that has been long neglected at an institutional level in Mexico). The results of these studies effectively refute misconceptions regarding Mexico's population, showing that Mexico is an exceptionally diverse country, where any color or type of trait can be found with ease in any region.\n\nSome studies, such as the one published by the American Sociological Association refute misconceptions that are very prevalent even among Mexicans themselves, as it found the differences in the frequencies of phenotypical traits such as blond hair between the population of the Northern regions of Mexico (where this trait has a frequency of 22.3% - 23.9%) and the population of the Central regions of Mexico (with a frequency of 18.9% to 21.3%) are not as pronounced as are commonly thought to be. Per the methodology of the study, the presence of blond hair was required for a Mexican to be classified as white as \"unlike skin color, blond hair does not darken with sun exposure\" With a similar methodology, other study, made by the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the frequency of blond hair at 23%, Mexicans with red red-hair were classified as \"other\".\n\nA 2014 study made by the University College London analyzed the frequencies of several different phenotypical traits on populations of five different Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). In the case of Mexico the National Institute of Anthropology and History collaborated in the investigation with the results being the following:\n\nThe majority of the samples (approx. 90%) hailed from Mexico City and Southern Mexican states meaning that Norh and Western regions of Mexico were underrepresented as around 45% of Mexico's population lives there. \nNationwide surveys sponsored by the Mexican government that quantify the percentage of the different skin tones present on Mexico's population have been made, the first in 2010 by the CONAPRED (Mexico's National Bureau for Prevention of Discrimination) and the second in 2017 by the INEGI (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics) Each study used a different color palette, in the case of CONAPRED's study it was a palette with 9 color choices developed by the institute itself whereas in the case of the INEGI study the palette used was the palette for the PERLA (Latin American Race and Ethnicity Project) with 11 color categories. \n\nAs the progression from the darker tones to the lightest ones is not as uniform in the palette used by the INEGI (some tones are practically the same while there are marked differences between others) as it is in the CONAPRED's palette, two color categories ended up containing nearly 70% of surveyed Mexicans whereas there were color categories that had less than 1% of Mexicans each. Even though Mexico's government has downplayed the racial connotations of said studies by opting for using the term \"light-skinned Mexican\" to refer to the segment of Mexico's population who possess European physical traits/appearance and \"dark-skinned Mexican\" to refer the segment of Mexico's population who does not, the publication of said studies hasn't been free of controversy, specially in the case of the study published in 2017 as besides skin color it also accounted for different socioeconomic factors such as educational achievements and occupational profiles, with media outlets bringing to Mexico's mainstream opinion circles concepts such as systemic racism, white privilege, and colonialism. Nonetheless it is agreed that to acknowledge that Mexico is a diverse country constitutes a steep in the right direction to fight social inequalities.\n\nIn 2018, the new edition of the ENADIS was published, this time being a joint effort by the CONAPRED and the INEGI with collaboration of the UNAM, the CONACyT and the CNDH. Like it's 2010 antecesor, it surveyed Mexican citizens about topics related to discrimination and collected data related to phenotype and ethnic self-identification. It concluded that Mexico is still a fairly conservative country regarding minority groups such as religious minorities, ethnic minorities, foreigners, members of the LGBT collective etc. albeit there's pronounced regional differences, with states in the south-center regions of Mexico having in general notoriously higher discrimination rates towards the aforementioned social groups than the ones states in the western-north regions have. For the collecting of data related to skin color the palette used was again the PERLA one. This time 11% of Mexicans were reported to have \"dark skin tones (A-E)\" 59% to have \"medium skin tones (F-G)\" and 29% to have \"ligh skin tones (H-K)\". The reason for the huge difference regarding the reported percentages of Mexicans with light skin (around 18% lower) and medium skin (around 16% higher) in the relation to previous nationwide surveys lies in the fact that the ENADIS 2017 prioritized the surveying of Mexicans from \"vulnerable groups\" which among other measures meant that states with known high numbers of people from said groups surveyed more people. \n\nA study performed in hospitals of Mexico City reported that in average 51.8% of Mexican newborns presented the congenital skin birthmark known as the Mongolian spot whilst it was absent in 48.2% of the analyzed babies. The Mongolian spot appears with a very high frequency (85-95%) in Asian, Native American and African children. The skin lesion reportedly almost always appears on South American and Mexican children who are racially Mestizos\nwhile having a very low frequency (5-10%) in Caucasian children. According to the Mexican Social Security Institute (shortened as IMSS) nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the Mongolian spot.\n\nMexicans are linguistically diverse, with many speaking European languages as well as various Indigenous Mexican Languages. Spanish is spoken by approximately 92.17% of Mexicans as their first language making them the largest Spanish speaking group in the world followed by Colombia (45,273,925), Spain (41,063,259) and Argentina (40,134,425). Although the great majority speak Spanish \"de facto\" the second most populous language among Mexicans is English due to the regional proximity of the United States which calls for a bilingual relationship in order to conduct business and trade as well as the migration of Mexicans into that country who adopt it as a second language.\n\nMexican Spanish is distinct in dialect, tone and syntax to the Peninsular Spanish spoken in Spain. It contains a large amount of loan words from indigenous languages, mostly from the Nahuatl language such as: \"chocolate\", \"tomate\", \"mezquite\", \"chile\", and \"coyote\".\n\nMexico has no official \"de jure\" language, but as of 2003 it recognizes 68 indigenous Amerindian languages as \"national languages\" along with Spanish which are protected under Mexican National law giving indigenous peoples the entitlement to request public services and documents in their native languages. The law also includes other Amerindian languages regardless of origin, that is, it includes the Amerindian languages of other ethnic groups that are non-native to the Mexican national territory. As such, Mexico's National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the language of the Kickapoo who immigrated from the United States, and recognizes the languages of Guatemalan Amerindian refugees. The most numerous indigenous language spoken by Mexicans is Nahuatl which is spoken by 1.7% of the population in Mexico over the age of 5. Approximately 6,044,547 Mexicans (5.4%) speak an indigenous language according to the 2000 Census in Mexico. There are also Mexicans living abroad which speak indigenous languages mostly in the United States but their number is unknown.\n\nMexican culture reflects the complexity of the country's history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of Spain, imparted during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements mainly from the United States have been incorporated into Mexican culture.\n\nThe Porfirian era (\"el Porfiriato\"), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the Mexican Revolution, cultural identity has had its foundation in the \"mestizaje\", of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, José Vasconcelos in his publication \"La Raza Cósmica\" (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the \"mestizo\") not only biologically but culturally as well. This exalting of \"mestizaje\" was a revolutionary idea that sharply contrasted with the idea of a superior pure race prevalent in Europe at the time.\n\nThe literature of Mexico has its antecedents in the literatures of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. The most well known prehispanic poet is Nezahualcoyotl. Modern Mexican literature was influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of Mesoamerica. Outstanding writers and poets from the Spanish period include Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Juana Inés de la Cruz.\n\nIn light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, José Vasconcelos in his publication La Raza Cósmica (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races, biologically as well as culturally.\n\nOther writers include Alfonso Reyes, José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Carlos Fuentes, Octavio Paz (Nobel Laureate), Renato Leduc, Carlos Monsiváis, Elena Poniatowska, Mariano Azuela (\"Los de abajo\") and Juan Rulfo (\"Pedro Páramo\"). Bruno Traven wrote \"Canasta de cuentos mexicanos\", \"El tesoro de la Sierra Madre.\"\n\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico was officially established in 1910, and the university become one of the most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico. UNAM provides world class education in science, medicine, and engineering. Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936), were established during the first half of the 20th century. Most of the new research institutes were created within UNAM. Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 to 1973. In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics.\n\nIn 1995 the Mexican chemist Mario J. Molina shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.\n\nIn recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the Large Millimeter Telescope (Gran Telescopio Milimétrico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range. It was designed to observe regions of space obscured by stellar dust.\n\nMexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes Mariachi, Banda, Norteño, Ranchera and Corridos; on an everyday basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as pop, rock, etc. in both English and Spanish. Mexico has the largest media industry in Hispanic America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in Central and South America and parts of Europe, especially Spain.\n\nSome well-known Mexican singers are Thalía, Luis Miguel, Alejandro Fernández, Julieta Venegas and Paulina Rubio. Mexican singers of traditional music are Lila Downs, Susana Harp, Jaramar, GEO Meneses and Alejandra Robles. Popular groups are Café Tacuba, Molotov and Maná, among others. Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), Mexican rock has seen widespread growth both domestically and internationally.\n\nMexican films from the Golden Age in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Hispanic American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Hispanic America and Europe. \"Maria Candelaria\" (1944) by Emilio Fernández, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous Spanish-born director Luis Buñuel realized in Mexico, between 1947 and 1965 some of his master pieces like \"Los Olvidados\" (1949), \"Viridiana\" (1961) and \"El angel exterminador\" (1963). Famous actors and actresses from this period include María Félix, Pedro Infante, Dolores del Río, Jorge Negrete and the comedian Cantinflas.\n\nMore recently, films such as \"Como agua para chocolate\" (1992), \"Cronos\" (1993), \"Y tu mamá también\" (2001), and \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Mexican directors Alejandro González Iñárritu (\"Amores perros\", \"Babel\", \"Birdman\"), Alfonso Cuarón (\"Children of Men\", \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", \"Gravity\"), Guillermo del Toro (\"Pacific Rim\"), Carlos Carrera (\"The Crime of Father Amaro\"), and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga are some of the most known present-day film makers.\n\nPost-revolutionary art in Mexico had its expression in the works of renowned artists such as Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, Rufino Tamayo, Federico Cantú Garza, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Juan O'Gorman. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of Mexican muralism, painted the Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader Lenin. Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican National Palace and the Palace of Fine Arts.\n\nFor the artistic relevance of many of Mexico's architectural structures, including entire sections of prehispanic and colonial cities, have been designated World Heritage. The country has the first place in number of sites declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in the Americas.\n\nMexico has no official religion, and the Constitution of 1917 imposed limitations on the church and sometimes codified state intrusion into church matters. The government does not provide financial contributions to the church, nor does the church participate in public education. However, Christmas is a national holiday and every year during Easter and Christmas all schools in Mexico, public and private, send their students on vacation.\n\nIn 1992, Mexico lifted almost all restrictions on the religions, including granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country. Until recently, priests did not have the right to vote, and even now they cannot be elected to public office.\n\nThe Catholic Church is the dominant religion in Mexico, with about 82.7% of the population as of 2010. In recent decades the number of Catholics has been declining, due to the growth of other Christian denominations (especially various Protestant churches and Mormonism), which now constitute 9.7% of the population, and non-Christian religions. Despite this, conversion to non-Catholic denominations has been considerably slower than in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Movements of return and revival of the indigenous Mesoamerican religions (\"Mexicayotl\", \"Toltecayotl\") have also appeared in recent decades. Islam and Buddhism have both made limited inroads, through immigration and conversion.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2003 they were indicted for child abuse for, among other things, keeping the children in cage-like enclosures. The Gravelles claimed the cages were made to protect the children from each other. \n\nTheir trial motivated legislators in Ohio to pass laws to prevent people from adopting so many children without a great deal of oversight by the state. They used parenting methods similar to those used in attachment therapy, which involves very strict control of children using isolation, food deprivation, and other disciplinary measures that are widely considered to be unreasonably harsh, or even inhumane. The trial gained international attention and brought many inadequacies of the adoption services systems in Ohio to the fore.\n\nIn 2005 the Gravelles were sentenced to two years in prison for their crimes. According to newspaper reports, their therapist, Elaine Thompson, a social worker practicing as an attachment therapist, advised the Gravelles on parenting techniques. Thompson, according to these reports, had undertaken counselling or therapy, including holding therapy, with some of the Gravelle children. Elaine Thompson was indicted along with the Gravelles, but pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in a plea bargain.\n\nThe Gravelles served their two-year sentences from April 2009 to March 2011.\n"}

He was also a prolific session musician and worked with the Who on the film soundtrack of \"Tommy\", Joe Cocker, Traffic, George Harrison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Peter Frampton, the Bee Gees's Maurice Gibb, Gary Wright, Johnny Thunders, Luther Grosvenor, Neil Innes, Steve Gibbons, Chris Jagger, Nanette Workman, Sean Tyla, Jim Capaldi, Pat Travers and Andy Fraser.\n\nIn 2014, Kellie released his debut solo album \"Music from The Hidden\", while still a member of the Only Ones. He died on 18 January 2017 following a short illness.\n\nMichael Alexander Kellie was born on 24 March 1947, in Birmingham, England, into a non-musical family. As a child, he showed an early interest in rhythm, practising on a coal shuttle with hearth brushes to simulate a snare drum. In his teen years, he joined St. Michaels Youth Club band as a drummer. He later played at \"The Track\" at Tudor Grange Sports Centre in Solihull. On the basis of this work, he was invited by Brian \"Monk\" Ffinch to play with Wayne and the Beachcombers in Birmingham, which started his career as a professional musician.\n\nIn 1966, Kellie played in Birmingham in a band called the Locomotive with Chris Wood of Traffic, and later with the V.I.P.'s (later Art) in Carlisle.\n\nManager Chris Blackwell found a singer and organist from the New York Times band named Gary Wright, added him to the line-up of Art and launched the band Spooky Tooth with Kellie, Greg Ridley, Jimmy Henshaw, Keith Emerson, Luther Grosvenor and Mike Harrison.\n\nAfter the initial decline of Spooky Tooth, Kellie joined Johnny Hallyday's band for a summer tour of France in 1974, before forming The Only Ones in 1976 with Peter Perrett, Alan Mair and John Perry.\n\nThe Only Ones, possibly best known for the single \"Another Girl, Another Planet\", recorded three albums for CBS, although over time, their catalogue has contained many compilations and other releases, which now outnumber their studio albums.\n\nIn February 1978, Johnny Thunders moved to London with his family, and began playing with a loose revue dubbed the Living Dead. Kellie became part of this floating line-up (that also included Perrett along with various Sex Pistols including Steve Jones and Paul Cook) and recorded Thunders’ \"So Alone\" album together with his signature song \"You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory\".\n\nFollowing the Only Ones' farewell in 1981 at London's Lyceum, Kellie moved to the countryside north of Toronto, Canada, where he spent four years away from performing. He used this time to learn the piano and write songs.\n\nReturning to Britain in 1985, Kellie spent several years hill farming in North Wales and Scotland where he became a shepherd. In 1999 Kellie reunited with Mike Harrison, Luther Grosvenor and Greg Ridley under the Spooky Tooth moniker. Together they released the \"Cross Purpose\" album.\n\nIn 2004, Kellie reunited with Mike Harrison and Gary Wright to play dates in Germany as a new incarnation of Spooky Tooth. The band later released the DVD \"Nomad Poets\" with live performances from Worpswede and Hamburg, Germany.\n\nIn 2007, the Only Ones reformed, touring the UK, Europe and Japan as well as performing on BBC TV's \"Later... with Jools Holland\".\n\nIn 2010, with the Only Ones undergoing another sabbatical, Kellie began recording his own collection of music which become his first solo album. Entitled \"Music from The Hidden\", the album was produced by Kellie who also played drums, organ, bass and acoustic guitars, percussion and sang lead vocals. There are also contributions from Gordon Jackson (acoustic guitar), Finley Barker and Tony Kelsey (guitars), Steve Winwood (organ, mandolin and bass), Bill Hunt, Levi French and Tony Ariss (pianos), Rob Harrison (bass) Steve Gibbons (backing vocals) and Greg Platt Lake (guitar and vocals).\n\nKellie was prominent among the musicians featured on the six-CD \"Jess Roden Anthology\", presented by Hidden Masters.\n\nHe contributed to the 2011 sessions for the Distractions re-union album, \"The End of the Pier\", which was released on Occultation Records in 2012.\n\n\n"}

His surname was sometimes reported as Wolfchild or WolfChild.\n\nBorn in Cardston, Alberta, Wolf Child identified himself as a victim of child abuse and neglect, who overcame this past to deliver a message to fellow youth. He helped establish youth groups including the Flying Eagles Youth Council, the Kainai Youth Council, the Peigan Youth Task Force, the Junior Foundation and the First Nations Liaison Project. He was founder and president of the Reclaiming Hope Foundation, and CEO of Reclaiming Hope, Inc. He was National Aboriginal Coordinator for the Students Commission of Canada, research assistant with Alberta Children's Services and with the University of Lethbridge, and a project coordinator with Kainai Children's Services. He received an Alberta Great Kids Award in 2002, and an honourable mention in 2003 for an Aboriginal Youth Achievement Award in the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards, now the Indspire Awards.\n\nBy 2006, Wolf Child was a third-year native studies and political science student at the University of Lethbridge, where he was elected an Arts and Sciences representative to the University of Lethbridge Students' Union in March 2006.\n\nIn proceedings of the Senate of Canada Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples on 21 February 2001, Senator Landon Pearson cited Wolf Child's work as a youth member of the Canadian delegation to a preliminary meeting working towards the United Nations Special Session on Children. \"He was splendid. People were blown away by his capacity to speak and to present himself and to connect with other young people. We are thrilled that we have been able to give him this opportunity.\" (The text records his surname as WolfChild.)\n\nIn 2005, Wolf Child founded the Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada, which since appears to have merged with the First Peoples National Party of Canada.\n\nWolf Child ran in the 2006 federal election as an independent candidate in the electoral district of Macleod in Alberta. In the first election after the Parliament of Canada had legalized same-sex marriage across the country, he identified his support for \"the traditional definition of marriage\" as a priority. He also condemned abortion. \"I don’t think the courts should have the final say in these decisions, it’s undemocratic,\" he said.\n\nOther priorities he identified included supporting farmers, veterans, and single mothers. He said he supported child care, opposed tax increases and supported public spending control. He also supported a \"patient's bill of rights\" for health care users, and proposed a national Aboriginal peace keepers' group to confront violence in native communities.\n\nHe received 1,055 votes, 2.12% of ballots cast. In a celebratory message to his website, he congratulated the winner, Conservative Ted Menzies, and their fellow candidates, and called his campaign a victory rather than a loss. \"I will be there next time, but it won’t be as an independent,\" he wrote. \"To tell you the truth, I was hoping to get at least 1,000 votes and I did.\"\n\nWolf Child posted a farewell to Liberal leader Paul Martin on his loss in that election. He wrote that he had supported Martin up to and through the 2003 leadership race, but that Martin had alienated faithful Liberals like Herb Dhaliwal, Allan Rock, John Manley, Sheila Copps, \"and even poor little [Don] Boudria.\" \"[D]on't push people around as you'll need them later on,\" he warned Martin. He ended the message more cheerfully: \"Vive le Canada. Stay Cool and Have an awesome time.\"\n\nWriting as acting leader of the APPC, he congratulated Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper on his appointment of Jim Prentice as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, appreciating that Prentice had committed to the Kelowna Agreement and to the residential school compensation package.\n\nWolf Child's prospective candidacy in the 2006 Liberal Party of Canada leadership race was reported by the \"Lethbridge Herald\" on 15 February 2006. \"I'd like to see the Liberal Party rejuvenated,\" he said. \"I hope I can inspire and bring faith to Canadians to vote Liberal again.\"\n\nIn a 2 March 2006 comment to a post on his candidacy on the blog \"Our Thoughts\", a poster identifying themselves as Wolf Child (including using his email address and website URL) wrote that \"[due] to personal commitments and my education, I am hereby dropping my name from the list.\"\n\nIn a \"Lethbridge Herald\" article dated 1 April 2006, he again expressed his interest in running, saying that he expected to know whether he could raise the $50,000 and the signatures required to register within 45 days. He told the \"Herald\" he hoped to win support, especially from aboriginal organizations, and to make First Nations issues prominent in his campaign, but to speak to all Canadians as well. “I’m a people’s candidate,\" he said, \"I want to address a lot of the social issues we have.”\n\nUnder the username nextprimeminister, a poster identifying themselves as Wolf Child posted to Ashley MacIsaac's Internet forum, congratulating MacIsaac on his reported candidacy in the same leadership race, and inviting MacIsaac to an official summit. Although opposed to same sex marriage, Wolf Child congratulated MacIsaac on his engagement to marry a man, and in another message wrote of his increased knowledge of and respect for the roles of two-spirited individuals in native spirituality and history, in spite of his often-repeated hatred of same-sex marriage.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Wolf Child's projects included Chairmanship of Reclaiming Hope Inc. and its sister foundation The Reclaiming Hope Foundation. He was also the president of the Kainai Youth Government, Southern Alberta Representative for the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Youth Advisory Committee, and Director-General of the Aboriginal Peace Keeper's Forces of Canada and Goodwill Representative for the National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention Program, and was named Co-Chairperson of the Aboriginal Project for Suicide Prevention alongside prominent Aboriginal leaders.\n\nThe \"Lethbridge Herald\" reported in August 2006 that regional police had charged Wolf Child with two counts of sexual assault, stemming from the claim that he performed oral sex on a man and fondled the genitals of another at a house party in April 2005. Wolf Child entered a not guilty plea in court 23 October 2006. Wolf Child plead guilty to the charges during the start of his trial on 5 February 2007. A sentencing hearing was scheduled for 27 March.\n\nAfter a long struggle, Myron Wolf Child committed suicide. The \"Lethbridge Herald\" ran an obituary which stated he died on 27 February 2007.\n\n"}

His occupation was listed as carpenter.\n\nLucas was born in Leatherhead, Surrey, England, to parents John Lucas & Mary Bradford in 1764. Lucas was tried at the Old Bailey, London on 7 July 1784 for feloniously stealing clothing with a value of 40 shillings. Lucas was sentenced to transportation for seven years and left England on the \"Scarborough\" in May 1787.\n\nAfter the First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson in January 1788, Phillip ordered Lieutenant Philip Gidley King to lead a party of fifteen convicts (9 men and 6 women) and seven free men to take control of Norfolk Island and prepare for its commercial development. Lucas was aboard the HMS Supply, which arrived at Norfolk on 6 March 1788.\nOn board the \"Supply\" Nathaniel met Olivia Gascoigne (\"b. 1763 - d. 12 Jun 1830\") whom he married on 5 November 1791, on Norfolk Island. Nathaniel and Olivia had thirteen children, although twins (Sarah and Mary) were killed at the age of two years when a large Norfolk Island Pine fell on the Lucas house.\n\nIn 1791 he received a grant of fifteen acres (6 ha) and in 1793 purchased another sixty acres (24 ha) from Charles Heritage, a former marine. Lucas took up farming and in August 1802 sold wheat, maize and pork worth £450 to the government stores on the island.\n\nOn 22 May, 1802, Lucas was appointed Master Carpenter at Norfolk Island.\n\nIn April 1805, Lucas returned with his family to Sydney in the Investigator.

He is most widely known as the artistic director of the Italian fashion label Diesel, and for being a frequent collaborator with singer-songwriter Lady Gaga. He worked two years (September 2010 – April 2013) with the French fashion house Mugler as artistic director.\n\nFormichetti is also known as fashion director of \"Vogue Hommes Japan\", is a contributing editor of several other fashion magazines, and is fashion director for the clothing company Uniqlo. In November 2010 he was named one of the \"most influential creative forces working in fashion today\". The following month he was awarded the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator at the 2010 British Fashion Awards.\n\nThe son of a Japanese stewardess and an Italian pilot, Formichetti was born in Japan and grew up in Rome and Tokyo, attempting to assimilate in both cultures. As a child he trained as a classical pianist (and still plays for relaxation). But moving to London became his great desire and he used the excuse of attending an architecture school to which he was accepted in order to get there. Formichetti has explained that instead of attending he \"literally walked in the front door of the architecture school and then ran out of the back one to go clubbing for three years.\" He became a student of the nightlife and street fashions, and began working at a fashionable boutique called 'The Pineal Eye' where he would become art director and head buyer for two years. Formichetti is openly gay.\n\nWhile working at 'The Pineal Eye' Formichetti was spotted by fashion editor Katy England and she offered him a monthly page at \"Dazed & Confused\" called \"Eye Spy,\" and after being named the magazine's fashion director in 2005 would eventually be promoted to become its creative director 2008. His work at \"Dazed & Confused\" led to other fashion magazines, including \"V\", \"Another Magazine\", \"Arena Homme +\", and \"Harper's Bazaar USA\". Among fashion designers he has worked with Kim Jones, collaborating with him on his collections and shows, and has worked with fashion houses such as Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Gareth Pugh, Carri \"Cassette Playa\" Mundane, Prada, Missoni, Iceberg, and brands such as Nike, Umbro, Puma, Stussy, Topman, H&M, and Edwin. Among fashion photographers Formichetti has worked with Nick Knight, Hedi Slimane, Terry Richardson, Steven Klein, and Oliviero Toscani, as well as others.\n\nFormichetti has currently been working with and styling rapper Brooke Candy \n\nFormichetti is a prominent current member of the Haus of Gaga and his collaboration with Lady Gaga as her stylist or fashion director began in early May 2009 at a shoot with photographer Sebastian Faena for the July 2009 issue of \"V Magazine\" (\"V60\"), Formichetti saying that \"It was an instant love.\" This was soon followed by a cover shoot for \"V61\" (September issue) with Mario Testino. The following June he was fashion director for her performance at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards, and following that for the majority of Lady Gaga's important performances and appearances in the second half of 2009, including at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards in September, where she appeared in four dresses by Jean-Paul Gaultier and one by Alexander McQueen, then on \"Saturday Night Live\" in October, where she appeared in a metal orb structure designed by Nazir Mazhar, and later at the Royal Variety Performance in December, where she appeared in a latex dress, by Atsuko Kudo, designed to resemble those worn by Elizabeth I of England, for Gaga's introduction to her namesake Elizabeth II. In the fall she also appeared in the third volume of \"Vogue Hommes Japan\", the editorial titled \"Lady Gaga & Araki's Tokyo Love\" shot by Nobuyoshi Araki, with fashion direction by Formichetti. Their first collaboration in a music video together, for \"Bad Romance\", directed by Francis Lawrence, would later be voted Video of the Year and then win the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. In this Gaga appears in several outfits and footwear by Alexander McQueen, reappears in the orb by Nazir Mazhar, as well as in a \"diamond crown\" outfit by Franc Fernandez, and one by her creative team—the Haus of Gaga—among other pieces. Formichetti is also credited as stylist for her album \"The Fame Monster\" (shot by Hedi Slimane), and has been fashion director for her sold-out The Monster Ball Tour.\n\nIn late January 2010 Formichetti was stylist/fashion director for Lady Gaga's music video for her song \"Telephone\", directed by Jonas Åkerlund, which was released in March. Immediately after this video was filmed came her appearance at the 52nd Grammy Awards (where Gaga performed with Elton John), for which Formichetti was also fashion director. In February he was fashion director again for her appearance at the 2010 BRIT Awards, where she dedicated her performance to their friend Alexander McQueen, who had committed suicide only five days earlier. Following their collaboration for several more appearances and performances over the next months came Formichetti's styling for her video for \"Alejandro\", directed by his collaborator in the past Steven Klein, and for the associated cover shoot by Terry Richardson for the mid-July issue of \"Rolling Stone\". Her \"American Idol\" performance of \"Alejandro\" in early May was also styled by Formichetti. Among other projects, next came the styling for Richardson's shoot of Gaga (in a meat bikini) and Nick Knight's shoot of model Jo Calderone (Gaga in \"drag\") for the fifth volume of \"Vogue Hommes Japan\". Around the same time Richardson shot Gaga as styled by Formichetti for the company Supreme NYC, but the shoot would wait until 2011 to be released both in the Supreme ad campaign and in the French magazine \"Purple\". Knight then photographed her again, styled by Formichetti, for the upcoming September issue of \"Vanity Fair\". In August the three would appear yet again in collaboration for the 30th birthday issue of the magazine \"i-D\" (the shoot itself actually dating from 2009), Formichetti also giving a short interview for the Gaga piece following hers. Then in September came her celebrated appearance, for which he did the styling, at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, where she wore (among other outfits) the famous \"meat dress\" by Franc Fernandez. Also in September the Fall issue of \"V Magazine\" (\"V67\") appeared on newsstands, with Gaga, styled by Formichetti and shot by Mario Testino, on the cover with Marc Jacobs.\n\nAt the end of 2010 she was named Best-Dressed of the Year by \"Vogue\".\n\nAfter several months largely out of the spotlight (except on tour) Gaga returned in January 2011 to begin the serious promotion for her upcoming album \"Born This Way\" and Formichetti has been fashion director for the project. The music video for the title track \"Born This Way\" was directed later in January by Nick Knight, with Formichetti responsible for the styling. In February came her performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards where they collaborated with designer Hussein Chalayan on her appearance and performance. Gaga, interested in the concept of rebirth, sent Formichetti a picture of a human embryo, and he was first inspired to create, as he told her, \"egg [shaped] shoes—like you were born that way, with eggs as feet.\" She took the idea further, resulting in the egg or \"vessel\" (designed by Chalayan) in which she was carried down the red carpet and later onto the stage, hatching out in a yolk-coloured latex outfit to perform her new single \"Born This Way\". She was wearing, as he tweeted, \"Mugler by Nicola Formichetti.\" A \"Born This Way\"-associated shoot called \"Alien Excess\" done in January by photographer Mariano Vivanco for the Spring 2011 (March) issue of \"i-D\" features Gaga in a latex coat from the new Mugler menswear collection, with Formichetti responsible for the styling. A shot from the same session with Vivanco, but with different styling, also by Formichetti, appeared on the cover of \"Billboard\" in February.\n\nHe has also done Gaga's styling (shot by Nick Knight) for her as spokesperson for the MAC Viva Glam Campaign of the MAC AIDS Fund. A new project called \"The Masterpiece\" has been announced in which Formichetti will collaborate with her for MAC to create a \"wearable piece of art\" composed of the profile photos of fans who join the campaign.\n\nOn October 23, 2012 in a \"Huffington Post\" interview, Formichetti was mentioned by fashion photographer Lope Navo: \"I bumped into then-stylist Nicola Formicetti in B Bar in NYC randomly and he told me he saw the first cover I shot in Milan for \"Rodeo\" magazine of Seijo Imazaki. He said he loved it and we have been in touch ever since. He gave me so much advice about my work.\" \n\nAfter months of rumours, in September 2010 Formichetti was announced as the new creative director for the Parisian fashion house founded by the celebrated designer Thierry Mugler (who has largely retired from the business), which he has renamed Mugler. He has said that it was in fact Lady Gaga who persuaded him to go for the job, when they were looking through pieces from the Mugler archive when shooting the video for \"Telephone\". At Mugler Formichetti oversees designers Sébastien Peigné for womenswear and Romain Kremer for menswear. Joël Palix, director general of the company, said \"We were looking for a young talent who could really bring energy to the brand ... Nicola is a multicultural, techno-savvy expert involved in fashion, communication, image and entertainment. He and the appointed talented designers will represent a new direction for French fashion. Nicola Formichetti leaves MUGLER on April 2, 2013. \"\nFor the occasion, he also asked the k-pop artist G-Dragon to compose a theme for the fashion runway, entitled \"I am Mugler\".\n\nThe menswear, a collaboration with Romain Kremer, of Formichetti's debut (Fall/Winter) collection \"Anatomy of Change\" premiered during the Men's Paris fashion week on 19 January 2011. This was accompanied by a video shot by Mariano Vivanco, featuring Formichetti's new muse, the full-body tattooed Canadian model Rick Genest, and by a remix by Lady Gaga, as musical director for the menswear project, of a new track (\"Scheiße\") from her upcoming album \"Born This Way\". The clothes, worn by Rico Genest and other models on the runway, recall those by Mugler himself from earlier decades, in such ways as the use of the colours navy blue and bright orange, or \"hyper-modern\"-style jackets lacking lapels. The collection also features some not-so-conventional latex pieces such as biker jackets, gloves, and even latex trousers. On the overall vision, Cathy Horyn of \"The New York Times\" describes Formichetti creating a \"mechanical man\" in the tradition of Mugler's fantastical woman, yet Adam Tschorn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" found plenty of the pieces surprisingly wearable. Formichetti himself says on the collection \"I want to say something that has the past and the future, but what is really important to me is the present.\" Returning to Rico Genest, it was his discovery by Formichetti and then Gaga's urging which actually resulted in the menswear show, something not originally planned. Genest's discovery also influenced the collection itself. The show was streamed live from Paris on the Internet.\n\nGenest can be seen styled in Mugler by Formichetti and shot by Mariano Vivanco in the sixth volume of \"Vogue Hommes Japan\", the editorial being titled \"Hard To Be Passive\". In the Spring/Summer 2011 issue of \"GQ Style\" (UK) Formichetti is interviewed on the future of the brand, with Genest (also interviewed) shot in Mugler by Karim Sadli for the editorial.\n\nOn March 2 the womenswear, a collaboration with Sébastien Peigné, premiered. Lady Gaga was again musical director, previewing the track \"Government Hooker\" from her upcoming album as well as including the already released title track \"Born This Way\" in the soundtrack. But this time she actually performed on the runway in person for Formichetti's show, modelling pieces from his collection, called \"Anatomy of Change Femme—Mode Sans Frontiers.\" Additionally, Rick Genest from the menswear collection made a reappearance on the runway among the models. The reaction of critics to the clothes was generally similar to their reaction to the menswear two months previously. Formichetti offers a silhouette in the Mugler tradition, \"minimally rendered\" as described by Cathy Horyn, and with sculptured shoulders (for the appropriate pieces), Alex Fury of SHOWstudio.com describing them as \"architectonic\". For the show Formichetti employed Rein Vollenga to contribute sculptural elements to the silhouette, Atsuko Kudo skin-like items of torn-up latex, and Franc Fernandez for Gaga's two hats. She herself gave input for the collection, associated with her \"Born This Way\" projects and performances, but is not financially involved with Formichetti's MUGLER. As he says, \"It's just friends helping each other... I think when you start talking about money, it stops the whole creative process for me.\"\n\nAlthough there was worry it might, Gaga's appearance did not prevent Formichetti's audience from noticing the clothes, variously described as \"shiny and sexy\", and \"taut and futuristic\", or like the menswear \"surprisingly wearable\", in particular the jackets and dresses. He chose to go mainly with the colours black, white, electric/royal blue, and beige. The set he designed for the show was composed of clustered columns from which rose arches to form a structure resembling the long central interior of a Gothic cathedral, the nave and its flanking aisles, through which the models, Genest and finally Gaga strutted. While it was found by critics among Formichetti's audience who were physically present at the show that both the architecture and lighting made it difficult to properly see the collection, the performance was as much or more for the millions around the world watching it streamed live on the Internet, like the menswear collection, but this time on the brand's Facebook page, and featuring 45 minutes live behind-the-scenes preshow. In fact he believes the future of the brand is a digital one, Formichetti saying \"I design digitally, I communicate digitally, and I live digitally, and I wanted to incorporate that into the brand.\" For him Gaga's performance fits in the \"new Mugler world\", a \"fantasy world\" fusion of high fashion and pop with an existence both real and digital. The performance continued with her wearing a leopard print see-through catsuit from his collection out on a Paris street and into the celebrated restaurant Maxim's for the afterparty.\n\nNicola, along with his brother Andrea Formichetti, created the Nicopanda line based on the panda cartoon that looks like Nicola. The story behind the name, accordingly to Nicola, \"my friends used to call me Nico Panda because I’m half Asian, I had this long beard back then; and was a little chubby, so I looked like a bear—an Asian bear. So people started calling me Nico Panda\" \n\nThe nicopanda line was first introduced in September 2011 at Nicola's pop up shop in New York's Tribeca district. Along with the Gage/Clemenceau Architects, the space at 50 walker street was transformed into a mirrored prism that housed vintage Versace, MUGLER, Uniqlo, Nicopanda products like the zombiepanda rings, iPhone and iPad skins in collaboration with Gizmobies, and looks by the Haus of Gaga. Nicola worried that people wouldn't show up to the store,\n\nWhile the pop-up was happening, Nicola made a competition for his fans on Twitter, where the winners were invited to the pop-up for a breakfast with Nicola and a preview of the new Uniqlo line he worked on, the Innovation Project. Fans drove from Ohio and flew in from Phoenix for this chance.\n\nIn May 2012, Nicola opened Nicopanda pop up stores at Lane Crawford in Beijing and Hong Kong.\n\nAfter opening up pop-up stores in Hong Kong and Beijing, Nicola opened up more pop-ups in Tokyo in June 2012. There were pop-ups in LHP in the Harajuku district, in Opening Ceremony in the SHibuya district, and also a pop-up shop and gallery at the Isetan Shinjuku department store. It was in this pop-up gallery that the Amebapanda chetti design was first presented, along with the Nicopanda X Hello Kitty collaboration.\n\nIn August 2012, Nicola and his brother Andrea opened up a \"super complex\" in Nicola's hometown of Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan. Villa Effe holds a wedding hall, a restaurant, a beauty salon and a shopping hall that includes displays of Haus of Gaga looks and the Nicopanda line.\n\nFormichetti was fashion editor for \"Vogue Hommes Japan\" from its inception until fall 2012, when the magazine was folded and repackaged into \"GQ Style\".\n\nAs of January 2013, Formichetti remains as fashion director for Uniqlo.\n\nIn addition to his collaboration with Lady Gaga for the MAC Viva Glam campaign, Formichetti has styled Irina Lăzăreanu, shot by Miles Aldridge and co-styled by Dillon Turman, for MAC's \"Quite Cute\" collection.\n\nIn the fifth volume of \"Vogue Hommes Japan\", Lady Gaga had the following to say about what she and Formichetti desire for the future of fashion:\nFormichetti has repeatedly declared he is \"not an elitist\" in fashion, instead wanting to share what he does with everyone, using the Internet for this purpose. Like Gaga, who has inspired him to do so, he also interacts with and is inspired by his followers, and usually works in collaboration with others. He sees himself not as a \"stylist\", which term he rejects, but rather as an art director \"whose job it is to create moods, oversee an overall image.\" As he told \"Vice\":\n\nHis influence is varied. Before his Mugler collections premiered he was ranked the most influential stylist in the world (even if he dislikes the term), in no small part because of the enormous volume of his fashion magazine work, including making \"Vogue Hommes Japan\" \"the most powerful Japanese-language publication in the global fashion industry\", and because of his consulting for a number of fashion houses and other brands. It is with and through Lady Gaga as her fashion director, however, that Formichetti's influence on culture is greatest. Previously the role and influence of stylists was more limited, and while others have become designers, he is the first to take control of a major fashion house, interpreted as the most prominent example of a stylist becoming a power broker within the industry. Formichetti's eclectic selection for the avant-garde Gaga of pieces from designers ranging vastly from the great, such as Giorgio Armani, to the obscure, has influenced what has been described as a \"cultural phenomenon\" of imitation, extending even into \"provincial backwaters\".\n\nHe frequently meets and is hopeful for many younger talents who are interested in fashion today.\n\nFormichetti practices Transcendental Meditation daily.\n\n"}
{"id": "17521097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17521097", "title": "Nyoman Masriadi", "text": "Nyoman Masriadi\n\nI Nyoman Masriadi (born 1973) is a painter and a leading artist of the post-Suharto era in Indonesia. His works have gained a collectors base which includes prominent collectors in and around the region.\n\nMasriadi was born 1973, in Gianyar, Bali. Masriadi received his training in art at the Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta (ISI).\n\nIn Bali, where he was born, there were two traditions of painting - a sacred one and one of words for a Western audience - but his relationship to these is indirect. Masriadi received his training in art at the Institute Seni Indonesia (ISI) Yogyakarta. From the time he was an art student, he had already been recognized by peers as one of the very first contemporary Balinese artists who eased himself away from an encompassing concern with Balinese life, culture and traditions in his works. He is reputed to have stood in front of the canvas on a cardboard box to restrict himself from any distractions and fidgety behavior; to learn the skill of painting.\n\nThe visual imagery and narratives in his paintings are derived from keen and intelligent observations of social life and behavioural traits. His visual vocabulary is striking, continuously refreshing and contemporaneously relevant. Early works show him sparring with Western modernism in the guise of cubism but meshing it with caricature, the language of street advertising and graffiti. The way he has overdrawn his finished paintings with a marker can best be seen as a means of inscribing himself in or against that tradition.\n\n\"Masriadi: Black Is My Last Weapon\" was the artist's maiden solo show at the Singapore Art Museum which was co organised by Gajah Gallery in 2008. The exhibit spanned Masriadi's 10-year career and explored the evolution of his signature black-skinned figures, a motif now widely copied by other Indonesian painters.\n\nMasriadi's works are marked by consistent high quality — thoughtful in the messages that transmit from scenes and figures in his pictorial world, and painstakingly detailed in execution and finish. These qualities have led him to receive positive reception from the art collecting world at large. He is Southeast Asia's most well-received contemporary artist at auctions; the appreciation of his works is a testimony to his forte and talent as a painter as well as a barometer of the ascendency of Southeast Asian contemporary art.\n\nHe was awarded the prize for Best Painting at the Dies Natalis ISI Yogyakarta in 1997. He has participated in group exhibitions in Australia and the Netherlands, and in Indonesia: In Bali,Singapore,Jakarta, Mungkid (Mageland), Solo, Surabaya and Yogyakarta.\n\nMasriadi is one of Southeast Asia's most well-received contemporary artists at auction.\n\nSotheby's (Hong Kong): Final Price HK$7,82 million, or US$1,000,725.\nThe sale of this work, a triptych conveying the resolve of the human spirit, marked a record for a contemporary Southeast Asian art piece at auction. It sold for about five times its estimated price.\n\nThis painstakingly rendered commentary on the art world and art practices of the 21st century sold for US$935,844 at Christie's Hong Kong as a lot in their Asian 20th Century and Contemporary Art (Evening Sale) on May 25, 2013.\n\nAt Christie's first auction in Shanghai, Masriadi's mixed-media piece \"Fatman,\" was sold for US$757,547, the highest price ever paid for a similar sized work of the artist.\n\nSotheby's (Singapore): Final Price US$370,668.\n\nPlaced into the social and political context of Masriadi's home country of Indonesia, it however simultaneously conveys a deeper story as he captures both the spirit and psyche of today's society. The emotions that are demonstrated by the football fans in the background–on the far right, anger; elsewhere, cheering supporters waving the national flag and banners carrying the words \"Indonesia\"–are indicative of Masriadi's cultural sensitivity and sharp humour.\n\n'Jago Kandang' is ranked No.1 in Sotheby's Top Ten Contemporary Southeast Asian Paintings according to C-Arts Asian Contemporary Arts and Culture Magazine, Vol.03 2008.\n\nOne painting by Indonesian artist Nyoman Masriadi was expected to sell for up to $25,000 (in 2007). In the end, a Southeast Asian collector paid SGD$360,000 (HK$1,854,000) for it, setting a world record price for a Masriadi painting.\n\nPaul Kasmin Gallery catalog, presented in collaboration with Gajah Gallery. \nEssay by Benjamin Gennochio.\n\nDespite Masriadi's contribution to and influence on Indonesian art there has not been, until this book, much written discussion of his work. This is long overdue. Nyoman Masriadi- Reconfiguring the Body brings a much needed intellectual discourse to Masriadi's work. That it has come together with such clarity and depth of expression can be attributed to two years of hard work by the author-editor, T.K.Sabapathy. His efforts to access first hand photos, articles and various bits of information have resulted in a thorough consideration of the evolution of Masriadi's art practice. Goenawan Mohamad uncovers the local complexities and richness of contemporary Indonesian society and experience. No writer is better able to lend such elegance to that most difficult of tasks - unlocking the culture, language and voice of artists in Indonesia.\n\nSingapore Art Museum presented Masriadi: Black is My Last Weapon in collaboration with Gajah Gallery which featured over 30 works completed in the past decade. It was published on the occasion of the Masriadi: Black is My Last Weapon exhibition from 22 August to 9 November 2008. Presented by curators Seng Yu Jin and Wang Zineng in four thematic sections, with each theme serving as a weapon, in the sense of an apparatus for engagement, to the interior world of the artist.\n\nA set of 15 postcards were designed as a commemorative piece for Gajah Gallery's 15th year anniversary celebration. The set is a compilation of work by Ahmad Zakii Anwar, J. Ariadhitya Pramuhendra, Jumaldi Alfi, M. Irfan, Mangu Putra, Nyoman Masriadi, Teng Nee Cheong and Yunizar.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "821921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=821921", "title": "Oski the Bear", "text": "Oski the Bear\n\nOski or Oski the Bear (named after the Oski Yell) is the official mascot of the University of California, Berkeley. Oski’s name, design and character were developed by William “Rocky” Rockwell, who was the first student to play the role, and former Daily Cal editor Warrington Colescott. Oski made his debut during the September 27, 1941 football season-opener against St. Mary's College and has been the university’s official mascot ever since. Up until 1941, live bears were used as mascots. After 1946, the bear's activities have been overseen by the Oski Committee, which also appoints a new Oski whenever a replacement is required. Oski's identity is protected by the Committee and wearers of the suit generally do not disclose their having worn the suit. There may be multiple members of the Committee who wear the suit depending on their schedules.\n\nOski is mentioned by name in several California fight songs. In the songs, the name \"Oski\" is used interchangeably with the title \"Golden Bear\". Several of the songs give an impression of Oski being a powerful guardian-being dwelling in the heavens, as well as sallying forth from a lair on Earth. Oski is identified as the astronomical constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear). Although Oski has his benign side (\"patient\" and \"silent\"), he is more often presented as growling, fighting, rumbling, grumbling, thundering, and shaking the ground. He is described as sturdy and mighty. It is said of Oski that he \"wears a Paderewski hair\", referring to Oski's shaggy hair.\n\nOski is described as \"Our totem\", and Cal's teams (or perhaps Cal students in general) are described as sons of the Golden Bear. In one song, Oski is referred to as \"He\" with a capital \"H\", as one refers to the Deity. One song appears to attribute to Oski the ability to fly through the air.\n\nThese characteristics are seen in the following lyrics of Cal fight songs:\n\nFight for California --\n\nOur sturdy Golden Bear\nIs watching from the skies;\nLooks down upon our colors fair,\nAnd guards us from his lair.\nBig \"C\" --\n\nGolden Bear is ever watching;\nDay by day he prowls\nThe Stanford Jonah --\n\nWhen our Oski rips through the air.\nLike our friend Mister Jonah, Stanford's team will be found,\nIn the tummy of the Golden Bear.\nCal Band March --\n\nAnd when the game's done,\nCalifornia's Golden Bear has carried the day.\nCalifornia, We're For You --\n\nAll our rival's hopes are doomed to die,\nWhen our Golden Bear looks down on high;\nHear our Oski's mighty thunder,\n\nBrawn and brain are all in vain\nUnless our spirit's there\nIn ev'ry son of the Golden Bear.\n\nLet the echoes ring our Oski\nGolden Bear --\n\nOh, have you seen the heavens blue, heavens blue,\nWhen just sev'n stars are shining through, shining through\nRight overhead a jovial crew?\nThey're joining hands to make the Bear\n\nAnd oh, that Bear's a glorious sight, glorious sight,\nA-circling 'round the pole all night, pole all night;\nAnd once you've seen him, you're all right,\nYou've seen our California Bear.\n\nHe has a very patient air, patient air,\nHe wears a Paderewski hair, 'rewski hair,\nHe's the center rush of the heavens I swear,\nOur silent, sturdy Golden Bear.\n\nA Californian through and through,\nOur totem, He, the Golden Bear.\nMake Way for the Bear --\n\nRumbling, grumbling, loud upon the air,\nSounds the growling of the mighty Bear.\nCalifornians gather 'round his Lair,\nAnd march to Victory.\n\nMarching along for California\nWe stride beside the fighting Bear.\nCalifornia Marching Song --\n\nCalifornians fight with the sturdy might\nof the growling Golden Bear.\nOur Oski sounds and shakes the ground\nAs vict'ry fills the air.\n\n"}
{"id": "29359211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29359211", "title": "Phokas (Byzantine family)", "text": "Phokas (Byzantine family)\n\nPhokas or Phocas (), feminine form Phokaina (Greek: Φώκαινα), was the name of a Byzantine aristocratic clan from Cappadocia, which in the 9th and 10th centuries provided a series of high-ranking generals and an emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969). Its members and their clients monopolized the high command positions of the Byzantine army for much of the 10th century and led the successful Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in the East. As one of the leading families of the Anatolian military aristocracy, the Phokades were also involved in a series of rebellions that laid claim to power and challenged the emperors at Constantinople. Their power was eventually broken by Basil II (r. 976–1025), and the family declined in importance after the 11th century.\n\nAccording to Michael Attaleiates, the family descended from the ancient Roman \"gens Fabia\", while Ali ibn al-Athir ascribed them an Arab origin from Tarsos. Whatever their origins, the Phokades appear to have settled in Cappadocia, where their estates were concentrated and which is clearly attested as their power base and the center of their activities. Various authors have speculated on an Armenian or Georgian origin, partly to account for the frequent presence of the name \"Bardas\" among the family members, but none of these hypotheses can be conclusively proven.\nThe first attested member of the family was a soldier, probably of humble origin, who was appointed \"tourmarches\" in 872. His son, Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, became a distinguished general, scoring several victories against the Arabs, especially in southern Italy, and reaching the position of Domestic of the Schools. His son, Leo Phokas the Elder, was also Domestic of the Schools, but was defeated by the Bulgarian tsar Symeon (r. 893–927), and later unsuccessfully opposed the rise of Romanos Lekapenos to the throne in 919, being captured and blinded. His brother, Bardas Phokas the Elder, already active as a general, fell in disgrace for a time, but by the time of Lekapenos's fall in 944, he was a \"patrikios\" and a high-ranking general.\n\nAfter the fall of the Lekapenoi clan, Constantine VII appointed Bardas as Domestic of the Schools, while his sons Nikephoros, Leo, and Constantine were placed as \"strategoi\" of the themes of Anatolikon, Cappadocia, and Seleukeia respectively. These appointments heralded a period of over twenty years when the Phokades and their clients monopolized the Byzantine army's leadership. During this period, the Phokas clan was closely allied with the Maleinoi, a rich and powerful family from Charsianon, through the marriage of Bardas to a Maleinos lady. Other families that were closely aligned with and often related to them through marriage were the Adralestoi, Skleroi, Kourkouai, Parsakoutenoi, Balantai, and Botaneiatai.\n\nBardas himself, already in his mid-sixties when named commander-in-chief, proved a mediocre general, suffering a string of defeats at the hands of the Hamdanid emir Sayf al-Dawla. One of them, in 953, even left his son Constantine captive in the Hamdanid's hands. Finally, in 955, Bardas was replaced by his son Nikephoros. With the aid of Leo, who had already established himself through victories of his own, and his nephew John Tzimiskes, Nikephoros achieved a series of successes, recovering Crete and Cyprus and repeatedly defeating Sayf al-Dawla's forces. With the sudden death of Romanos II in 963, the popular and powerful Nikephoros seized the throne, becoming senior emperor and guardian over the young sons of Romanos, Basil II, and Constantine VIII. His father Bardas was named \"Caesar\", and his brother Leo became \"kouropalates\" and \"logothetes tou dromou\". As emperor, Nikephoros continued his campaigns in the East, conquering Cilicia and northwestern Syria.\n\nNikephoros's regime, however, quickly became unpopular, both due to his focus on military affairs to the detriment of the economy and for his religious policies. In December 969, he was murdered by a group of disaffected generals led by his nephew and one-time protégé John Tzimiskes, with the connivance of Empress Theophano. The Phokades were dismissed from their posts and titles and exiled by the new regime. Bardas Phokas the Younger, the younger son of the \"kouropalates\" Leo and former \"doux\" of Chaldia, escaped and rose up in revolt in 970, but was defeated, tonsured, and exiled to Chios, while in 971 Leo and his eldest son the \"patrikios\" Nikephoros were blinded and their property confiscated. One member of the family had a different fate: Leo's daughter Sophia Phokaina had married Constantine Skleros, the brother of Bardas Skleros. Constantine was Tzimiskes's brother-in-law from his first marriage and a close ally of the new emperor. Their daughter, Theophano, was married in 972 to the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II (r. 973–983).\n\nIn 978, Bardas was recalled by Basil II to lead the imperial forces against the rebellion of Bardas Skleros. Named \"magistros\" and Domestic of the East, he managed to defeat Skleros. Bardas himself rebelled in 987, with the support of many of the major aristocratic families, in an uprising that lasted until his death in 989 at the Battle of Abydos. Skleros, who had returned from his Arab exile and had been captured by Bardas Phokas, tried to assume the leadership of the revolt, allying himself with Bardas's sons Leo and Nikephoros, but soon submitted to the emperor. Leo tried to hold out in Antioch but was surrendered to the emperor by the city's inhabitants.\n\nAfter facing down the rebellions of the large aristocratic families, Basil II undertook a series of measures to curb their power, wealth, and influence. The Phokades in particular were kept away from military posts and suffered the confiscation of their extensive estates. Basil's edict of 996, directed against the often illegal accumulation of vast estates by the Anatolian magnates, specifically names the Phokades and the closely allied Maleinoi as targets of the emperor's legislation. The Phokades, however, retained a measure of influence in their native Cappadocia: there, in 1022, Bardas Phokas's son Nikephoros, surnamed \"Barytrachelos\" (Βαρυτράχηλος, \"wry-neck\"), in alliance with Nikephoros Xiphias, was proclaimed emperor. He was soon murdered by Xiphias and the Phokas supporters deserted the revolt, which quickly broke apart. The last mention of a direct descendant of the Phokas family comes in 1026, when the \"patrikios\" Bardas, the grandson of the \"magistros\" Bardas, was accused of plotting against Emperor Constantine VIII (r. 1025–1028) and blinded.\n\nThese events signalled the end of the direct line of the great 10th-century generals, which almost certainly died out by the mid-11th century. Nevertheless, the prestige attached to the family name remained considerable for a time after their end: the historian Michael Attaleiates praised Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078–1081) for being related to the Phokades, \"whose glory stretches over all the land and the sea\". The Phokas name is rarely mentioned thereafter, until it experienced a revival during the 13th century in the Empire of Nicaea: Theodotos Phokas, the uncle of Theodore I Laskaris (r. 1205–1222), became \"megas doux\", a certain Michael Phokas was \"stratopedarches\" in 1234, and another family member was metropolitan bishop of Philadelphia.\n\n"}

{"id": "1407551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1407551", "title": "Samoans", "text": "Samoans\n\nSamoans or Samoan people (), are a Polynesian ethnic group native to the Samoan Islands, an archipelago in Polynesia, who speak the Samoan language. The group's home islands are politically and geographically divided between the Independent State of Samoa and American Samoa, an unincorporated territory of the United States of America. Though divided by political powers, the culture and language remains one and the same.\n\nSamoans were renown through the Pacific for their seafaring culture and thus was named the Navigator Islands by the first European visitors upon witnessing first hand the Samoan people's seafaring skills.\n\nThe Samoan people and culture form a vital link and stepping stone in the formation and spread of the Polynesian culture, language and religion throughout Eastern Polynesia.\n\nA Polynesian culture of trade, religion, war, colonialism are important identifying markers within the Polynesian culture that almost certainly formed its roots within the Samoan culture. Samoa's colonial history with the kingdom of Tonga, Fiji and French Polynesia forming the impases for what is the modern Polynesian cultural marker points.\n\n\"Matai\", otherwise known as the head of the family and extended family, is a very important figure in the Samoan culture. There are many aspects that go into fully understanding the term \"Matai\", such as how one is elected and what their role is.\n\nThe election of a \"Matai\" is a lengthy process that can last up to several weeks and is often a highly competitive race. In this race different branches from each family put forth a male candidate, accompanied by reasons why he would be a good candidate. These reasons range from the candidate’s wisdom to wealth, including highly praised values such as negotiating, ritual knowledge, politics and economics. However, if the son of a \"matai\" meets these requirements, he is typically given a major edge in the race. Another advantage the son of a \"matai\" or any man in the \"matai’s\" household is given is being able to observe and help the \"matai\" starting from a young age. Most men considered for the \"Matai\" position are at least 40 years old, meaning many young candidates don’t even stand a chance. One strategy that can be used by any males aspiring to become a \"matai\" is to choose to live in a household that has no other males, or to move to his wife’s household if there are no males in her family's household either.\n\nThe election of a \"matai\" is under the guidance of another \"matai\" who is related to the family, allowing for a fair election. Once a new \"matai\" is chosen, a feast is thrown for the family, followed by a bigger feast for the whole village at a later date. At the larger feast, the \"matai\" is expected to give a traditional inaugural speech, displaying his abilities to speak publicly, his wisdom and retelling of Samoan myths. Throughout this speech he is watched by village council, as well as all the other \"matai’s\" in the village. Once the \"matai\" has proved himself to the other \"matai’s\" by giving the traditional address, he is called on to serve the community as a whole. The newly elected \"matai\" is expected to host a village wide feast where he is tasked with providing food for the meal, as well as getting the other \"matais\" gifts.\n\nOnce this task is completed the newly elected \"matai\" is officially considered the \"matai\" of his household and will hold the position for the rest of his life, should he lead correctly. In certain cases where a \"matai\" is deemed cruel or ineffective, the title is stripped and a new \"matai\" is elected. However, a more often occurrence is the current \"matai\" becoming elderly or ill and requesting that a new \"matai\" be elected in order for there to be a more stable and effective leadership in place.\n\nThe role of a \"matai\" is a very large and important one. He is expected to provide leadership in all aspects of family life. He encourages warm family relations, offers advice, directs religious participation, and oversees disputes. As well as watching over the family land and representing the family in village affairs. Overall, a \"matai\" must have different demeanor than everyone else, especially other males in the family. \"Matai's\" are also in charge of economic situations. For example, a \"matai\" must manage the amount of food his family brings in and must stores one away for when times are hard. The \"matai’s\" job as a leader is one that is very important in Samoan culture and helps the overall structure stay in place.\n\nWhile chiefs, talking chiefs and \"matais\" all have a title, there are men in the village that are untitled. These men are placed in a group titled the \"aumaga\". These men are the labor core of the community as they perform most the hard labor. The \"aumaga\" are tasked with building houses, repairing roads, planting and harvesting the garden, fishing and cutting coconut meat and selling it. The \"aumaga\" also have ceremonial responsibilities, such as helping the chief in ritual cooking and serving the food at ceremonies. They also serve as informal keepers of peace, interacting with each other as a large group of friends. They often play cards, cricket or gather for dances and parties with each other. The \"Aumaga\" are under control of a relative of the chief, called the \"manaia\", who helps organize the \"aumaga\" and plan their activities . Despite not always being the true son of the chief, the \"manaia\" is still referred to as son by the chief.\n\nThe main leader of each individual household is named the Aiga of the family. One person, predominately a male figure, is elected to become the Aiga of his extended family. Elections take place after the former Aiga has died or is no longer to fulfill his duties, either for ethical reasonings or old age.Elections are a long and strenuous process for members of the extended family. For one portion of the family is going up against the other portion, leading to tensions within the whole family. Each Aiga is the owner of their family's land. On that piece of land, extended families live, grow crops, cook and do other household chores. Also on that piece of land is where another elected member resides, the Matai. Due to the large amount of households within a single village, there are a large amount of Aiga. So much so that some are able to trace back their Aiga timeline over a dozen different Aiga. The reasoning for the large amount of Aigas is that the title could be claimed through blood ties, marriage, and adoption.\n\nAlthough the Samoan Natives (Tagata Māo‘i) have long claimed to be the indigenous people of their islands — holding firm to the belief that Samoans were birthed from a tear in the Heavens (Lagi, Lani) special creation in Samoa — it has been theorized by many linguists and anthropologists, based on linguistic commonalities as well as archaeological findings, that migrants from Southeast Asia arrived in the Samoan Islands approximately 3500 years ago, settling in what has come to be known as Polynesia further to the east.\n\nIt is possible, as the natives suggest, that the Samoan Islands were settled some time before 1000 BC and that the original settlement predates the arrival of those to whom the pottery was culturally relevant. It is also generally a wide spread Cultural belief throughout Samoa that the Island's were the central base point for the beginning of the great voyages, the Polynesian expansion to the East and South.\n\nThese stories and Legends are recorded in print by European historians, Anthropologists, Archaeologists and still spoken of in contemporary times by Samoan High Chiefs in their great speeches and decrees during Kava ceremonies and Chiefly/ Royal ceremonies.\n\nThe voyages still spoken of in ancient Polynesian Chieftain Oratory poetics (lauga) are called 'Taeao'; a recalling of past histories and contacts within the Polynesian archipelago by Samoan Oral High Chiefs. These 'Taeaos' include oral and written accounts of familial tribal/klan contacts with the neighboring islands of;\n\n1) Tokelau (New Zealand)\n\n2) Tuamotu (French Polynesia)\n\n3) Huahine (French Polynesia)\n\n4) Tahiti (French Polynesia)\n\n5) Ha'apai (Tonga)\n\n6) Vava'u (Tonga)\n\n7) Rarotonga (Cook Islands)\n\n8) Pukapuka (Cook Islands)\n\n9) Tuvalu\n\n10) Havai'i (Hawaii)\n\n11) Futuna (France)\n\n12) Uvea (France)\n\n13) Rotuma (Fiji)\n\n14) Viti-Levu (Fiji)\n\nEarly contact with Europeans was established in the 18th century. Christianity was formally introduced with the arrival of L.M.S. Christian missionaries in August 1830.\n\nDuring the early 20th century the Samoan Islands were partitioned by Germany, Great Britain and the USA. Tutuila and Aunu'u islands were claimed by the USA and later joined by the Kingdom of Manu'a (1904) to become the current Territory of American Samoa. The western islands became German Samoa. In 1914, New Zealand forces captured the islands from Germany, thus becoming Western Samoa. Western Samoa regained its independence on January 1, 1962. In 1997 it formally changed its name to Samoa.\n\nMarriage ceremonies are considered important within the Samoan culture. Marriage involves the transfer of property of the female property, the toga, to the male property the oloa. It is a village event, with two ceremonies and a feast at the conclusion. In the first ceremony, the bride and groom march through the village to a district judge. The judge then conducts a civil ceremony. Concluding that official ceremony, the newlyweds next gather in a church where a religious ceremony is performed by a member of the church. At a feast, families provide food from all over the village. After the conclusion of the wedding, the newlyweds choose which side of the family they would like to live with. After moving in with a particular family, they are expected to do work around the land and the house to help provide for their family.\n\nWhen families have children, they too are expected to help with duties and chores around the land. However, they are not expected to do much until ages three or four. The young girls take care of other children and housework, while the boys help with cultivation, animals and water gathering. By the time the children reach the age of seven or eight, they are supposed to know and are acclimated to the life and chores of the Samoan culture. This includes being adept in \"agriculture, fishing, cooking, and child care\" to go along with a multitude of other chores that their elders have directed them to do in past. As the Samoan people age the most tasks they are given and the most responsibilities they hold, until they can take over fully for the aging members of their extended family.\n\nWhen a member of extended family dies, the funeral preparations start almost immediately. Choirs are directed to the mourner's land. The deceased body is bathed and dressed in white. They are placed on woven mats before the funeral less than 24-hours later. During those 24-hours, at least one family member has to stay with the deceased. A feast concludes the event, with food being served to mourners and people who helped with the burial. Other family members take over the responsibilities of the deceased while still serving their own personal chores around the land.\n\nThe elected Matai of the community is the controller of every portion of a village land. The village Matai says what cultivators will do with land and \"hold sway over allocation of plots and the ways in which those plots are used.\" The only aspect the Matai does not control is who the land will go to after his death. This is to avoid it being controlled by one family for a long period of time. There are four categories that land is divided: Village House Lots, Underbrush, Family Reserve and Village Land.\n\nVillage house lots is where individual houses or huts of single person or family lives. These houses are built in clusters. The clusters include multiple different aspects, but all look the same. Each house includes a main sleeping house, a guest house and a latrine. Yards with trees and gardens make up the house village lot, with some lots containing the entirety of the extended family.\n\nThe underbrush covers the entirety of the land. These plots of land are recognizable to all villagers and are separated by boundaries. Boundaries are usually made up from a variety of rocks, streams, trees and plants. It is very easy to distinguish the different properties owned by separate families.\n\nFamily reserve sections are where crops are cultivated. The biggest amount of crops grown within the Samoan culture is taro leaves and yams. These plots are available to be shared with other villages and other families. However, they would be no longer classified as a family reserve but regarded as owning the crops but not the land. The family reserve is not cultivated as much as other sources of property. This is due to the fact that crops grown here are able to grow quickly and easily without many interruptions.\n\nVillage land is the least cultivated and most shared portion of land in Samoan villages. To be able to plant here requires permission from the village council. This is because \"the land is community property and not family owned\". Village land is the biggest aspect of any figure of land and is where hunting for food, such as wild pig and birds are allowed. Fishing is also an aspect that is allowed within village land.\n\nTraditional Samoan tattoo (tatau), pe'a (male tatau), malu (female tatau), demonstrate the strong ties many Samoans feel for their culture. Samoans have practiced the art of tattooing men and women for over 2,000 years. To this day, a man's tattoo extensively covers from mid-back, down the sides and flanks, to the knees. A woman's tattoo is not as extensive or heavy. The geometric patterns are based on ancient designs that often denote rank and status. The va'a (canoe), for example, stretches across a man's mid-back.\n\nIn Samoa's cultural past most males were tattooed between the ages of 14–18, when it was determined they had stopped growing, so the designs would not stretch and suffer in beauty. Today, there has been a strong revival of traditional tattooing in the past generation, not only in Samoa but throughout Polynesia, often as a symbol of cultural identity.\n\nTatau, the Samoan word for tattoo has a number of meanings including \"correct\" or \"rightness\". It also signifies the correct quadrangular figures in reference to the fact that Samoan tattoo designs do not include circular lines, although other Polynesian tattoo motifs do. Early Englishmen mispronounced the word tatau and borrowed it into popular usage as tattoo.\n\nTraditional tattooing is a painful process. The Samoan tattoo master dips his cutting tools into black ink made from the soot of burnt candlenut shells and then punctures designs into the skin. The cutting tool consists of a short piece of bamboo or light wood with a piece of tortoiseshell bound at right angles at one end. A little bone comb is bound to the lower broad end of the tortoiseshell. The larger the comb, the greater the area on the skin is covered with fewer strokes. The master uses a small mallet to repeatedly tap a short-handled instrument. The process takes days and is sometimes partially accomplished over longer periods, with recuperation in between.\n\nTattoo designs have changed to include freehand symbols such as the kava bowl representing hospitality; the characterization of the Samoan house or fale signifying kinship; emblems of nature — shells, fish, birds, waves, centipedes; and the traditional geometric lines and angles of different lengths and sizes.\n\nModern pop and rock have a large audience in Samoa, as do several native bands; these bands have abandoned most elements of Samoan traditional music, though there are folky performers. Recently, the population has seen a resurgence of old Samoan songs, remixed in the style of reggae but with some traditional elements, such as the use of the pate and old chord structure.\n\nInitially in Samoan music,\n\"there were just two instruments in use; the pate, a hollowed out log drum that comes in various sizes, and the fala, a rolled up mat beaten with sticks. In addition to this was the human voice. This limited range of instrumentation had no effect on the importance of music in Samoan life. Because there was no written language many stories and legends were propagated through song and the complex rhythms from the pate are essential in the performance of many Samoan dances. In fact in many dances, the dancers themselves add to the rhythm by clapping their hands, and dependent upon the way in which the hand is held produce a range of different sounds. Two instruments were developed that are now synonymous with Samoan music, the selo and the ukulele. The selo is a stringed instrument made from a broomstick, or similar object, attached to a large box, bucket or other object that acts as a sounding board. A single length of string joins the top of the stick to the box, which is plucked to produce a sound similar to that of a bass. The ukele is a small guitar-like instrument but with only four strings. It can be found in two forms, one which is like a miniaturised guitar, the other where the body is made from half a coconut shell.\"\n\nWestern string instruments such as guitars are widely available across the Pacific Islands, with many bands performing and recording acoustic and amplified music in Samoa since the 1970s. Younger generations continue to perform in string bands as well as gravitate toward genres such as reggae, hip hop, rhythm and blues, gospel and soul.\n\nThe Fire knife dance or \"Siva Afi\" is the most popular Samoan dance among tourists in Samoa. The Fa'ataupati or slap dance, performed by males, consists of fierce slapping of the body in rhythmic motion to drum beats. Other Samoan dances include the Maulu'ulu, which is an all-female dance that is more elegant. The Sasa is a dance that can be performed by both males and females in a seated position or standing. The Siva Tau is a war dance performed by Samoan sporting teams before each match. Taualuga is a dance for the chief's son or daughter. When a girl does taualuga she is called a taupou, when a boy does a tauluga he is called a manaia.\n\nAthletes of Samoan descent are widely known for their success in full-contact sports such as American football, rugby union, rugby league, boxing, professional wrestling, and mixed martial arts. Samoa is said to be the cradle of the Pacific that produces the highest number of top-level rugby union and rugby league players per capita. American Samoa produces the highest number of NFL players and has been dubbed \"Football Island\" by mainland coaches and media. It's estimated that a boy born to Samoan parents is 56 times more likely to get into the NFL than any other boy in America. Samoans are also well represented in limited-contact and non-contact sports such as basketball, baseball, netball, soccer, and volleyball.\n\nMargaret Mead, an American anthropologist, is famous for her ethnography turned novel titled \"Coming of Age in Samoa\". This ethnography has information on problems adolescents in Samoa face, and the approaches to understanding these problems. Mead wrote, \"A Samoan village is made up of some thirty to forty households, each of which is presided over by a head man called a \"matai\".\" Regarding Samoan social structures and rules, Mead wrote, \"Until a child is six or seven at least she associates very little with her contemporaries.\" \"The women,\" she observed, \"are completely dependent upon their husbands for their status in this village group\". Regarding attitudes toward female sexuality, Mead wrote, \"Where parents of lower rank complacently ignore their daughters' experiments, the high chief guards his daughter's virginity as he guards the honor of his name\".\n\n\n\n"}

Too young to carry a gun, he became a dispatch rider.\n\nOn the Tuesday after Easter Sunday 1916, the Oranmore Company assembled at 10.00 a.m. under the command of Captain Joe Howley. Furey participated in the following attack on the local R.I.C. station, which failed.

{"id": "1681960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1681960", "title": "Vladimir Velebit", "text": "Vladimir Velebit\n\nVladimir \"Vlatko\" Velebit, PhD (1907–2004) was a Yugoslav communist who joined the Partisans in 1941, reaching the rank of Major-General. A lawyer by profession, after the war he became a diplomat and historian.\n\nAmong his notable post-World War II appointments were the Yugoslav Ambassador to Rome as well as the Court of St. James's and World Bank. Additionally, he was Yugoslav Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, and UNECE Executive Secretary from 1960 to 1967.\n\nBorn in Zadar, Austria-Hungary to Serbian-Austrian father Ljubomir Velebit and Slovenian-Croatian mother Olga Šeme, Vladimir's family had a long military tradition. His father Ljubomir was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, fighting on the Russian front during World War I and later becoming brigadier-general in the Royal Yugoslav Army, while Vladimir's paternal grandfather Dušan Velebit was a general in the Austrian Army who married Elisabeth Marno von Eichenhorst, daughter of another Austrian general Adolf Marno von Eichenhorst. Even Vladimir's great grandfather Ilija Velebit was an officer in the Austrian army.\n\nHis male ancestors were Serbs originating from the village of Gornja Pastuša near Petrinja in the Banija region that was part of the Austrian-created Military Frontier. They were recruited into the Austrian army, eventually achieving high ranks.\n\nVelebit began his formal education in Timișoara in German language. His family left the city just after the outbreak of World War I and went to Trieste while his father was off in Russia fighting for the Austro-Hungarians. Young Vladimir was soon moved again, this time to Vienna where he got enrolled in private school that held classes in French language. Following the end of the war in 1918 and final break-up of Austria-Hungary, the family moved to Zagreb that was now part of newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. At this point, 11-year-old Vladimir spoke very little Serbo-Croatian and had to study hard in order to be able to communicate in school. Due to his father's (who was now in the Royal Yugoslav Army) job, the family then moved to Čakovec and later to Varaždin, which is where Vladimir graduated high school in 1925.\n\nHe started studies at the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Law and then went to Paris for specialization, before returning to Zagreb to graduate in 1931. He earned his PhD two years later in 1933 from the same university.\n\nAfter passing the lawyer's and judge's exams, Velebit began working as legal assistant at the District Court in Niš. Accused of having leftist political leanings during his student days he got transferred to Leskovac. Once there he hooked up with Communist Party (KPJ) members (a political party that was at the time an underground organization because of the ban on its activities in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and took part in starting the newspaper \"Leskovačke nedeljne novine\" that wasn't openly communist, but supported political opposition to the ruling coalition and by proxy to King Alexander I Karađorđević. Because of this Velebit got transferred again, this time to Priština where he was a judge in the County Court. The continual career demotion didn't deter Velebit from continuing with leftist activity; in Priština he started a readers' group that met clandestinely in his room to read Marxist literature and discuss politics. When authorities caught wind of this, the county sheriff ordered his room to be searched, but nothing incriminating was found. Velebit then became the chief of County Court in Kičevo, and later got transferred to Šid where he established contact with more KPJ members among whom was Herta Haas (at the time a student at Economics High School in Zagreb, later to become Josip Broz Tito's wife).\n\nBy 1937 Velebit had enough of being a judge, and moved to Zagreb where he established a law practice. Already deeply involved with the communists, in parallel with his legal practice he became a courier for the underground movement. Due to the nature of his job and a considerable network of professional connections, he was perfectly suitable for carrying messages to foreign countries. On one of those trips to Istanbul in 1939, 32-year-old Velebit met 47-year-old Josip Broz Tito who was KPJ's general secretary at the time. Being impressed with Velebit's guile, skills, and intelligence, Tito immediately offered him membership in the party. After becoming a full-fledged member Velebit began working as assistant to Josip Kopinič, Comintern's agent in Zagreb. In 1940 Velebit obtained and set up a radio station used to establish daily contact with Moscow - the station was never discovered and was functional throughout the war.\n\nFollowing April 1941 Nazi invasion and dismemberment of the Yugoslav Kingdom, Velebit stayed in Zagreb that became capital of the newly created Nazi client, Ustaše-run puppet state entity Independent State of Croatia (NDH). He operated as an underground collaborator of the KPJ-established People's Liberation Front. While working underground he used the alias name Vladimir Petrović, although due to being a well known and respected lawyer before the war he experienced no trouble with NDH authorities.\n\nDuring March 1942 Velebit left Zagreb and joined the Partisans who mounted a guerrilla resistance to the Nazis and domestic collabrationists. Right away Tito included him in the army's Supreme Command where he mostly worked on establishing some sort of military court authority. Due to his education and knowledge of foreign languages, along with Koča Popović and Milovan Đilas, Velebit was part of the Partisan delegation in Gornji Vakuf and Zagreb at the controversial March 1943 German-Partisan negotiations while the Battle of Neretva raged several hundred kilometers to the south. Velebit and Đilas conducted the negotiations under pseudonyms Vladimir Petrović and Miloš Marković, respectively, while Koča Popović gave his real name.\n\nIn June 1943, Velebit became the point of contact for foreign military missions in their dealings with the Partisans. Following the death of Ivo Lola Ribar (member of Supreme Command and the chief of Partisan first military mission) on 27 November 1943, Velebit took over his duties. Following the Teheran Conference where the Allies agreed on backing the Partisan resistance exclusively over the Chetnik one, Velebit was sent to the Near East with lieutenant-colonel Miloje Milojević for negotiations over the details and scope of the support. After establishing first contact with the Allies in Cairo, he was on his way to London for further negotiations. Once there, Velebit had meetings with British envoys Fitzroy Maclean and William Deakin over the formal recognition of the People's Liberation Front as a new state entity. In May 1944 Velebit met with Winston Churchill and was also present in Caserta near Naples during Churchill's meeting with Tito on 12 August 1944.\n\nRight after the end of World War II Velebit continued his diplomatic activity.\n\nIn the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia's provisionary government that got formed on the basis of British-brokered Treaty of Vis and later the Belgrade Agreement, he was the deputy to the Foreign Affairs Minister. He then became one of the chief members of the secret Yugoslav diplomatic mission to Washington, negotiating the terms and scope of the American help to Yugoslavia. After returning home to the country that was in the meantime re-constituted as a Stalinist communist state called Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, he became deputy to Foreign Affairs Minister Stanoje Simić. In that role, Velebit negotiated with the Allies during the Trieste Crisis.\n\nIn March 1948, after Soviet accusation that he was a British spy, Velebit was forced into resigning his post at the Yugoslav Foreign Affairs Ministry and got moved to the Tourist and Service Industry Committee. During the 1948 Cominform resolution and the fallout of subsequent Tito-Stalin split, Velebit was on more than one occasion cited by the Soviets as a spy who works for the British.\n\nIn 1951, Velebit became Yugoslav ambassador to Italy, while a year later he got the same job in the United Kingdom. During March 1953, he prepared Tito's first official state visit to a Western country. Tito thus became the first communist leader to visit the UK.\n\nIn 1960, on invitation from the United Nations general-secretary Dag Hammarskjöld, Velebit became executive secretary at the UN European Economic Commission (UNECE) in Geneva. He performed this job up until his retirement in 1967. Known in Western circles as a skilled diplomat, his last assignment was as an emissary of the Carnegie Foundation in the Isreli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIn the early 1990s during the Yugoslav breakup and the beginning stages of the Yugoslav Wars, Velebit moved from London to Zagreb due to nationalist threats. Once back he divided his time between Zagreb and Mali Lošinj.\n\nIn 1992 Velebit was a contributor for the Radio Television of Serbia documentary series entitled Yugoslavia in War 1941-1945.\n\nDuring retirement he wrote two books 1983's \"Sećanja\" (Memories) and 2002's \"Tajne i zamke Drugog svetskog rata\" (World War II's Secrets and Traps).\n\nHe died on 29 August 2004 at the Rebro clinical center in Zagreb. He was buried at the city's Mirogoj Cemetery on 3 September 2004.\n\nVladimir Velebit is mentioned in the 2009 book \"A Rat Hole to be Watched\" by American historian Coleman Armstrong Mehta as the point of contact between Frank Wisner (head of the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Plans) and Yugoslav communist government during the early 1950s. Wisner apparently contacted Velebit because he was known to be the leading proponent of the idea that Yugoslav state should be oriented towards the West. According to Mehta's book that's based upon recently declassified American intelligence documents, the Wisner-Velebit contact, which occurred in the wake of Tito-Stalin split, eventually resulted in intelligence cooperation agreement between the United States and Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The agreement enabled the Americans to get their hands on recently developed and deployed MiG-15 Soviet fighter plane, which was delivered to them by the Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav government in 1951.\n\nVelebit married Vera Becić, a woman of Croatian ethnicity, the daughter of Croatian painter Vladimir Becić.

{"id": "37142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37142", "title": "Zeno of Citium", "text": "Zeno of Citium\n\nZeno of Citium (; , \"Zēnōn ho Kitieus\"; c. 334 – c. 262 BC) was a Hellenistic thinker, of Phoenician descent, from Citium (, \"Kition\"), Cyprus. Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature. It proved very popular, and flourished as one of the major schools of philosophy from the Hellenistic period through to the Roman era.\n\nZeno was born c. 334 BC, in Citium in Cyprus. Most of the details known about his life come from the biography and anecdotes preserved by Diogenes Laërtius in his \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\". Diogenes reports that Zeno's interest in philosophy began when \"he consulted the oracle to know what he should do to attain the best life, and that the god's response was that he should take on the complexion of the dead. Whereupon, perceiving what this meant, he studied ancient authors.\" Zeno became a wealthy merchant. On a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus he survived a shipwreck, after which he went to Athens and visited a bookseller. There he encountered Xenophon's Memorabilia. He was so pleased with the book's portrayal of Socrates that he asked the bookseller where men like Socrates were to be found. Just then, Crates of Thebes, the most famous Cynic living at that time in Greece happened to be walking by, and the bookseller pointed to him.\n\nZeno is described as a haggard, dark-skinned person, living a spare, ascetic life despite his wealth. This coincides with the influences of Cynic teaching, and was, at least in part, continued in his Stoic philosophy. From the day Zeno became Crates’ pupil, he showed a strong bent for philosophy, though with too much native modesty to assimilate Cynic shamelessness. Hence Crates, desirous of curing this defect in him, gave him a potful of lentil-soup to carry through the Ceramicus; and when he saw that Zeno was ashamed and tried to keep it out of sight, Crates broke the pot with a blow of his staff. As Zeno began to run off in embarrassment with the lentil-soup flowing down his legs, Crates chided, \"Why run away, my little Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen you.\"\n\nApart from Crates, Zeno studied under the philosophers of the Megarian school, including Stilpo, and the dialecticians Diodorus Cronus, and Philo. He is also said to have studied Platonist philosophy under the direction of Xenocrates, and Polemo.\n\nZeno began teaching in the colonnade in the Agora of Athens known as the Stoa Poikile (Greek Στοὰ Ποικίλη) in 301 BC. His disciples were initially called Zenonians, but eventually they came to be known as Stoics, a name previously applied to poets who congregated in the Stoa Poikile.\n\nAmong the admirers of Zeno was king Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedonia, who, whenever he came to Athens, would visit Zeno. Zeno is said to have declined an invitation to visit Antigonus in Macedonia, although their supposed correspondence preserved by Laërtius is undoubtedly the invention of a later writer. Zeno instead sent his friend and disciple Persaeus, who had lived with Zeno in his house. Among Zeno's other pupils there were Aristo of Chios, Sphaerus, and Cleanthes who succeeded Zeno as the head (\"scholarch\") of the Stoic school in Athens.\n\nZeno is said to have declined Athenian citizenship when it was offered to him, fearing that he would appear unfaithful to his native land, where he was highly esteemed, and where he contributed to the restoration of its baths, after which his name was inscribed upon a pillar there as \"Zeno the philosopher\". We are also told that Zeno was of an earnest, gloomy disposition; that he preferred the company of the few to the many; that he was fond of burying himself in investigations; and that he disliked verbose and elaborate speeches. Diogenes Laërtius has preserved many clever and witty remarks by Zeno, although these anecdotes are generally considered unreliable.\n\nZeno died around 262 BC. Laërtius reports about his death: \n\nDuring his lifetime, Zeno received appreciation for his philosophical and pedagogical teachings. Among other things, Zeno was honored with the golden crown, and a tomb was built in honor of his moral influence on the youth of his era.\n\nThe crater Zeno on the Moon is named in his honour.\n\nFollowing the ideas of the Academics, Zeno divided philosophy into three parts: Logic (a very wide subject including rhetoric, grammar, and the theories of perception and thought); Physics (not just science, but the divine nature of the universe as well); and Ethics, the end goal of which was to achieve happiness through the right way of living according to Nature. Because Zeno's ideas were later expanded upon by Chrysippus and other Stoics it can be difficult to determine precisely what he thought. But his general views can be outlined as follows:\n\nIn his treatment of Logic, Zeno was influenced by Stilpo and the other Megarians. Zeno urged the need to lay down a basis for Logic because the wise person must know how to avoid deception. Cicero accused Zeno of being inferior to his philosophical predecessors in his treatment of Logic, and it seems true that a more exact treatment of the subject was laid down by his successors, including Chrysippus. Zeno divided true conceptions into the comprehensible and the incomprehensible, permitting for free-will the power of assent (\"sinkatathesis\"/συνκατάθεσις) in distinguishing between sense impressions. Zeno said that there were four stages in the process leading to true knowledge, which he illustrated with the example of the flat, extended hand, and the gradual closing of the fist:\nZeno stretched out his fingers, and showed the palm of his hand, – \"Perception,\" – he said, – \"is a thing like this.\"- \nThen, when he had closed his fingers a little, – \"Assent is like this.\" – Afterwards, when he had completely closed his hand, and showed his fist, that, he said, was Comprehension. From which simile he also gave that state a new name, calling it \"katalepsis\" (κατάληψις). But when he brought his left hand against his right, and with it took a firm and tight hold of his fist: – \"Knowledge\" – he said, was of that character; and that was what none but a wise person possessed.\n\nThe Universe, in Zeno's view, is God: a divine reasoning entity, where all the parts belong to the whole. Into this pantheistic system he incorporated the physics of Heraclitus; the Universe contains a divine artisan-fire, which foresees everything, and extending throughout the Universe, must produce everything:\nZeno, then, defines nature by saying that it is artistically working fire, which advances by fixed methods to creation. For he maintains that it is the main function of art to create and produce, and that what the hand accomplishes in the productions of the arts we employ, is accomplished much more artistically by nature, that is, as I said, by artistically working fire, which is the master of the other arts.\n\nThis divine fire, or aether, is the basis for all activity in the Universe, operating on otherwise passive matter, which neither increases nor diminishes itself. The primary substance in the Universe comes from fire, passes through the stage of air, and then becomes water: the thicker portion becoming earth, and the thinner portion becoming air again, and then rarefying back into fire. Individual souls are part of the same fire as the world-soul of the Universe. Following Heraclitus, Zeno adopted the view that the Universe underwent regular cycles of formation and destruction.\n\nThe Nature of the Universe is such that it accomplishes what is right and prevents the opposite, and is identified with unconditional Fate, while allowing it the free-will attributed to it.\n\nLike the Cynics, Zeno recognised a single, sole and simple good, which is the only goal to strive for. \"Happiness is a good flow of life,\" said Zeno, and this can only be achieved through the use of right Reason coinciding with the Universal Reason (\"Logos\"), which governs everything. A bad feeling (\"pathos\") \"is a disturbance of the mind repugnant to Reason, and against Nature.\" This consistency of soul, out of which morally good actions spring, is Virtue, true good can only consist in Virtue.\n\nZeno deviated from the Cynics in saying that things that are morally indifferent could nevertheless have value. Things have a relative value in proportion to how they aid the natural instinct for self-preservation. That which is to be preferred is a \"fitting action\" (\"kathêkon\"/καθῆκον), a designation Zeno first introduced. Self-preservation, and the things that contribute towards it, has only a conditional value; it does not aid happiness, which depends only on moral actions.\n\nJust as Virtue can only exist within the dominion of Reason, so Vice can only exist with the rejection of Reason. Virtue is absolutely opposed to Vice, the two cannot exist in the same thing together, and cannot be increased or decreased; no one moral action is more virtuous than another. All actions are either good or bad, since impulses and desires rest upon free consent, and hence even passive mental states or emotions that are not guided by reason are immoral, and produce immoral actions. Zeno distinguished four negative emotions: desire, fear, pleasure and pain (\"epithumia, phobos, hêdonê, lupê\" / ἐπιθυμία, φόβος, ἡδονή, λύπη), and he was probably responsible for distinguishing the three corresponding positive emotions: will, caution, and joy (\"boulêsis, eulabeia, chara\" / βούλησις, εὐλάβεια, χαρά), with no corresponding rational equivalent for pain. All errors must be rooted out, not merely set aside, and replaced with right reason.\n\nNone of Zeno's writings have survived except as fragmentary quotations preserved by later writers. However, the titles of many of Zeno's writings are known and are as follows:\n\nThe most famous of these works was Zeno's \"Republic\", a work written in conscious imitation of (or opposition to) Plato. Although it has not survived, more is known about it than any of his other works. It outlined Zeno's vision of the ideal Stoic society built on egalitarian principles.\n\n\n\n"}
