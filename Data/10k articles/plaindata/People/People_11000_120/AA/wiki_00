Specifically, the sauce, which is marketed as Sabrett's Prepared Onions, is usually served on Sabrett brand hot dogs sold by New York's many pushcart hot dog vendors. \n\nSabrett brand hot dogs and the red onion sauce which Geisler created are the flagship products of Marathon Enterprises, Inc. The company is headquartered in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nGeisler was a graduate of Tenafly High School in Tenafly, New Jersey. He received his bachelor's degree in food technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served as an officer in the Quartermaster Corps of the US Army during the Korean War.\n\nGeisler resided in Mahwah, New Jersey, for 45 years. He was an ardent stamp collector and dealer, and an original member of the Apple Ridge Golf and Country Club of Mahwah, NJ. An avid golfer with a 4 handicap at one time, he won the Club Championship in all four flights, and throughout his career eagled all 18 holes. He played the bagpipes with the Fairleigh Dickinson University Pipe Band and the Kearny Caledonian Pipe Band for several years, even performing in the St. Patrick Day Parade in NYC.\n\nGeisler founded a company that manufactured shortenings, emulsifiers and other ingredients for the baking and baked goods industry in 1960. \n\nOne of his customers was Gregory Papalexis, who manufactured both hot dogs and hot dog buns. Papalexis's customers included hot dog street vendors, who often made a popular homemade, but time laborious, onion sauce as a topping. Papalexis asked Geisler to come up with a factory-made onion sauce for the hot dog vendors to sell at their carts in New York City.\n\nGeisler, with input from Papalexis, created a new, mass-produced onion sauce for hot dogs. The main formula and spice blends of the sauce consisted predominantly of onions, olive oil and tomato paste, which gives the sauce its distinctive red coloring. The sauce proved to be a hit with both the street vendors, who no longer had to make their own time consuming sauces, and hot dog consumers.\n\nGeisler and Papalexis partnered to form their own company, called Tremont Foods, to market and make the new red onion sauce. The sauce was initially sold to New York City hot dogs vendors under the brand names Tremont Foods or House of Weenies. \n\nPapalexis acquired Sabrett Food Products in 1989. As a result of the acquisition, Geisler's onion sauce became the only onion sauce served on Sabrett hot dogs by vendors in New York City. The red onion condiment also became available for purchase in supermarkets under the Sabrett's brand. It is marketed nationwide as \"Sabrett's Prepared Onions.\" \n\nAs of 2009, Geisler's red onion sauce enjoys \"a couple of million dollars a year in sales,\" according to Papalexis. Geisler's and Papalexis's original company, Tremont Foods, is currently a division of Marathon Enterprises, Inc., which owns the Sabrett trademark. (Marathon Enterprises is owned by Papalexis.) The only product made by Tremont Foods is the popular red onion sauce. The sauce is manufactured in The Bronx, but production is scheduled to shift to a new facility, in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, in 2009. \n\nGeisler remained active with the company until his death in 2009.\n\nGeisler died at his winter home in Hernando, Florida, on January 6, 2009, at the age of 78. Geisler had been suffering from a protein disorder called amyloidosis. He was survived by his wife, Jean Geisler, his daughter, Martha Geisler, his son, Glenn Geisler, his brother and a grandson.\n\n"}

They traditionally lived in an area west of the upper White Nile river.\nThe name is also used to refer to a breed of cattle maintained by the Aliab Dinka people and widespread in the region.\n\nThe Aliab Dinka mainly live in the Lakes State of South Sudan, in the Awerial County, to the west of the White Nile.\nThe Aliab Valley is a low floodplain to the west of the Bahr-el-Gebel (Nile) between Tombé in the south and Lake Papiu in the north. The valley is between and wide and perhaps in length. The Bahr-el-Gebel flows well above the east side of the valley between high banks.\nDuring the rainy season, usually starting in June, the river overflows its banks and floods the whole valley, which becomes a huge swamp. After the southern half of the valley has drained, between December and April it is suitable for cattle grazing. A report from 1951 said that some Dinka hunted the abundant game during this period, particularly buffalo.\n\nIn 1919 the Aliab Dinka country lay within the Mongalla Province of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.\nThere was an uprising of the Aliab Dinka that year.\n3,000 Dinka men attacked the police post at Mingkaman ( Guol-yier ), near Bor, and killed several policemen.\nMandari tribesmen in the region to the south attacked at the same time and killed some telegraph linesmen and police.\nLieutenant Colonel Richard Finch White took several companies of the Egyptian Army Equatorial Battalion to the area to handle the situation.\nThe Mongalla province Governor Chauncey Hugh Stigand went on patrol himself, and on 8 December 1919 was killed at Pap, between the Lau River and the White Nile.\nTwo other officers and 24 soldiers and porters were speared to death by 1,000 Dinka warriors.\nThe rising was put down harshly in 1920.\nA force under Colonel Robert Henry Darwall led the punitive expedition, which killed over 400 Dinka, Atwot and Mandari tribesmen, burnt many villages and took about 7,000 cattle.\n\nStigand's successor Vincent Reynolds Woodland wrote that \"The Government has done nothing for the Aliab. It has not protected them from aggression, has given them no economic benefits ... it has forced them to do a certain amount of labour, to pay taxes and to endure a not negligible amount of extortion by police\". However, although he removed the Egyptian \"ma'mur\" at Minkammon who had triggered the Aliab revolt through his abuses, Woodland did not appoint a replacement. The Aliab Dinka were left with no administration at all.\n\nThe Aliab Dinka have traditionally been primarily pastoral in occupation, although they engage in some agriculture.\nIn the past, the Aliab Dinka had a close relationship with the Mandari people. In the dry season, the Mandari would graze the Aliab grasslands beside the Nile. In return, the Aliab Dinka would share the Mandari woodland grazing in the rainy season.\nIn times of shortage, however, there has been conflict between the Aliab and Bor Dinka and the Mandari. During the period starting in 1972 with the end of the First Sudanese Civil War the Aliab Dinka used their control of administrative posts to undermine the old agreements on dry season grazing. \nWhen hostilities resumed in 1983 with the Second Sudanese Civil War there was a violent reaction against the Dinka, with many being killed by the Mundari in Juba.\n\nConflict flared up between the Aliab Dinka and the Mandari again in November 2009. About 40 people were killed in a dispute over grazing land on the border of Aliap and Terekeka counties during a period of water shortage. \nNine of the Dinka were killed and about 31 Mundari men were shot dead by the more heavily armed Dinka.\nThe Aliap Dinka claimed that the Mandari had been the aggressors, abducting five women and four children and stealing 20 cows.\n"}

{"id": "98367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98367", "title": "Antisthenes", "text": "Antisthenes\n\nAntisthenes (; ; c. 445c. 365 BC) was a Greek philosopher and a pupil of Socrates. Antisthenes first learned rhetoric under Gorgias before becoming an ardent disciple of Socrates. He adopted and developed the ethical side of Socrates' teachings, advocating an ascetic life lived in accordance with virtue. Later writers regarded him as the founder of Cynic philosophy.\n\nAntisthenes was born c. 445 BC and was the son of Antisthenes, an Athenian. His mother was a Thracian. In his youth he fought at Tanagra (426 BC), and was a disciple first of Gorgias, and then of Socrates; so eager was he to hear the words of Socrates that he used to walk daily from Peiraeus to Athens, and persuaded his friends to accompany him. Eventually he was present at Socrates's death. He never forgave his master's persecutors, and is said to have been instrumental in procuring their punishment. He survived the Battle of Leuctra (371 BC), as he is reported to have compared the victory of the Thebans to a set of schoolboys beating their master. Although Eudokia Makrembolitissa supposedly tells us that he died at the age of 70, he was apparently still alive in 366 BC, and he must have been nearer to 80 years old when he died at Athens, c. 365 BC. He is said to have lectured at the Cynosarges, a gymnasium for the use of Athenians born of foreign mothers, near the temple of Heracles. Filled with enthusiasm for the Socratic idea of virtue, he founded a school of his own in the Cynosarges, where he attracted the poorer classes by the simplicity of his life and teaching. He wore a cloak and carried a staff and a wallet, and this costume became the uniform of his followers.\n\nDiogenes Laërtius says that his works filled ten volumes, but of these, only fragments remain. His favourite style seems to have been dialogues, some of them being vehement attacks on his contemporaries, as on Alcibiades in the second of his two works entitled \"Cyrus\", on Gorgias in his \"Archelaus\" and on Plato in his \"Satho\". His style was pure and elegant, and Theopompus even said that Plato stole from him many of his thoughts. Cicero, after reading some works by Antisthenes, found his works pleasing and called him \"a man more intelligent than learned\". He possessed considerable powers of wit and sarcasm, and was fond of playing upon words; saying, for instance, that he would rather fall among crows (\"korakes\") than flatterers (\"kolakes\"), for the one devour the dead, but the other the living. Two declamations have survived, named \"Ajax\" and \"Odysseus\", which are purely rhetorical.\n\nAntisthenes' nickname was \"the (Absolute) Dog\" (ἁπλοκύων, Diog. Laert.6.13) \n\nIn his \"Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,\" Diogenes Laertius lists the following as the favorite themes of Antisthenes: \"He would prove that virtue can be taught; and that nobility belongs to none other than the virtuous. And he held virtue to be sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, since it needed nothing else except the strength of a Socrates. And he maintained that virtue is an affair of deeds and does not need a store of words or learning; that the wise man is self-sufficing, for all the goods of others are his; that ill repute is a good thing and much the same as pain; that the wise man will be guided in his public acts not by the established laws but by the law of virtue; that he will also marry in order to have children from union with the handsomest women; furthermore that he will not disdain to love, for only the wise man knows who are worthy to be loved\".\n\nAntisthenes was a pupil of Socrates, from whom he imbibed the fundamental ethical precept that virtue, not pleasure, is the end of existence. Everything that the wise person does, Antisthenes said, conforms to perfect virtue, and pleasure is not only unnecessary, but a positive evil. He is reported to have held pain and even ill-repute () to be blessings, and said that \"I'd rather be mad than feel pleasure\". It is, however, probable that he did not consider all pleasure worthless, but only that which results from the gratification of sensual or artificial desires, for we find him praising the pleasures which spring \"from out of one's soul,\" and the enjoyments of a wisely chosen friendship. The supreme good he placed in a life lived according to virtuevirtue consisting in action, which when obtained is never lost, and exempts the wise person from error. It is closely connected with reason, but to enable it to develop itself in action, and to be sufficient for happiness, it requires the aid of \"Socratic strength\" ().\n\nHis work on Natural Philosophy (the \"Physicus\") contained a theory of the nature of the gods, in which he argued that there were many gods believed in by the people, but only one natural God. He also said that God resembles nothing on earth, and therefore could not be understood from any representation.\n\nIn logic, Antisthenes was troubled by the problem of universals. As a proper nominalist, he held that definition and predication are either false or tautological, since we can only say that every individual is what it is, and can give no more than a description of its qualities, e. g. that silver is like tin in colour. Thus he disbelieved the Platonic system of Ideas. \"A horse I can see,\" said Antisthenes, \"but horsehood I cannot see\". Definition is merely a circuitous method of stating an identity: \"a tree is a vegetable growth\" is logically no more than \"a tree is a tree\".\n\nAntisthenes apparently distinguished \"a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference.\" This \"suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference.\" \nThe principal basis of this claim is a quotation in Alexander of Aphrodisias's “Comments on Aristotle's 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: \n\nIn later times, Antisthenes came to be seen as the founder of the Cynics, but it is by no means certain that he would have recognized the term. Aristotle, writing a generation later refers several times to Antisthenes and his followers \"the Antistheneans,\" but makes no reference to Cynicism. There are many later tales about the infamous Cynic Diogenes of Sinope dogging Antisthenes' footsteps and becoming his faithful hound, but it is similarly uncertain that the two men ever met. Some scholars, drawing on the discovery of defaced coins from Sinope dating from the period 350–340 BC, believe that Diogenes only moved to Athens after the death of Antisthenes, and it has been argued that the stories linking Antisthenes to Diogenes were invented by the Stoics in a later period in order to provide a succession linking Socrates to Zeno, via Antisthenes, Diogenes, and Crates. These tales were important to the Stoics for establishing a chain of teaching that ran from Socrates to Zeno. Others argue that the evidence from the coins is weak, and thus Diogenes could have moved to Athens well before 340 BC. It is also possible that Diogenes visited Athens and Antisthenes before his exile, and returned to Sinope.\n\nAntisthenes certainly adopted a rigorous ascetic lifestyle, and he developed many of the principles of Cynic philosophy which became an inspiration for Diogenes and later Cynics. It was said that he had laid the foundations of the city which they afterwards built.\n\n\n\n"}

He had succeeded General Pedro B. Benoit van der Horst who ruled for less than a week. After the civil war ended, both General Imbert and his rival Colonel Francisco Caamaño resigned and Héctor García-Godoy, a civilian, was sworn as interim president.\n\nImbert was born into a prominent family of military tradition: his father, Brigadier General Segundo Manuel Imbert Mesnier had a leading role in the northern region of the Dominican Republic; Brigadier General Segundo Francisco Imbert, Imbert Barrera’s grandfather, was Vice-President of the Dominican Republic and candidate for President, and fought in the Dominican Restoration War; meanwhile his great-grandfather, Major General José María Imbert, who was a French migrant, achieved important victories against Haiti in the Dominican War of Independence.\n\nImbert’s first significant position was as governor of Puerto Plata in 1940. He was removed from the post by then president Rafael Trujillo for sending him a telegram informing upon the names of the survivors of the failed . This caused, in a personal manner, the beginning of the assassination plan against Trujillo.\n\nHis brother Segundo, an army official too, was imprisoned in 1956 by Trujillo’s regime. Segundo was convicted for murder; implicated in the murder of Domingo Marión in 1943.\n\nOn May 30, 1961 Trujillo was shot dead when his car was ambushed on a road outside the Dominican capital. Imbert, the driver of the ambushing vehicle, was accompanied by Antonio de la Maza, Salvador Estrella Sahdalá and Amado García Guerrero - the active participants who carried out the plot. Most of those involved in the assassination plot were subsequently captured and executed, with the exception of Imbert and Luis Amiama Tió. Imbert went into hiding until December 2.\n\nAfter Joaquín Balaguer, Trujillo’s figurehead president, was overthrown in 1962 and the Trujillo family was ousted, Imbert was declared a \"National Hero\" and was promoted to Major General with the special grant of it being \"advitam\" or lifelong. In the Civil War in the Dominican Republic of 1965 he led one of the factions in the struggle which faced the constitutionalist government led by Colonel Francisco Caamaño, who tried to bring back Juan Bosch to the country's presidency.\nImbert's faction, called the Government of National Reconstruction was endorsed by the U.S. troops inspectors, in addition, he was one of the collaborators with the Americans, finally signing a peace act that put an end to the April war.\n\nOn March 21, 1967, he was shot in Santo Domingo while traveling with Marino García, in an attempted assassination made by the late dictator Trujillo's supporters. He survived by driving himself to a medical clinic. On February 15, 1970 the Dominicana de Aviación flight wherein his sister Aída Imbert Barrera, his wife Guarina Tessón Hurtado, and his daughter, sportswoman Leslie Imbert Tessón, were travelling, crashed into the Caribbean Sea.\n\nHe was Minister of Defense of the Dominican Republic from 1986 to 1988; earlier that decade, his second-cousin Mario Imbert McGregor was also Minister of Defense. In 1989 he was assigned chairman of the board of directors of Rosario Dominicana. In September 2013, the \"Constitutionalist Soldiers of 25 April 1965 Foundation\" asked the National Congress of the Dominican Republic to explore the possibility of stripping Imbert his status of national hero as it considered that he went against constitutional precepts when he supported the coup against Bosch and the U.S. occupation of the country, mong other accusations.\n\nImbert died on May 31, 2016, the day following the fifty-fifth anniversary of Trujillo's assassination, at the age of 95. Dominican President Danilo Medina declared three days of mourning. His niece, Carmen Imbert Brugal, said that cause of his death was complications of pneumonia.\n\nHe married Guarina Tessón Hurtado on September 10, 1939 in Puerto Plata. They had three children:\n\nHe had a liaison with María Sánchez, from Sosúa, and begat Manuel Antonio Imbert Sánchez (born April 1, 1939), police officer and former diplomat; Imbert Sánchez is a colonel and is married (to Josefina López Henríquez) with 4 children and he is since 2012 the chief of the Special Police Corps for State Banks, he also was consul to the United States in Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands in the 1980s and the 1990s.\n\nHis wife died in 1970 in an aircraft accident.

The press has compared Youssef with American comedian Jon Stewart, whose satire program \"The Daily Show\" inspired Youssef to begin his career. In 2013, he was named one of the \"100 most influential people in the world\" by \"Time\" magazine. Youssef's current projects are \"Tickling Giants\", \"The Democracy Handbook\", and \"Revolution For Dummies\".\n\nBassem Youssef graduated from Cairo University's Faculty of Medicine, majoring in cardiothoracic surgery, in 1998. He passed the United States Medical Licensing Examination and has been a member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) since February 2007. He also received training in cardiac and lung transplantation in Germany, after which he spent a year and a half in the US working for a company that produces medical equipment related to cardiothoracic surgery.\nIn January 2011, Youssef assisted the wounded in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution.\n\nInspired by the Egyptian revolution of 2011, Youssef created his first satirical show in March 2011. Entitled \"The B+ Show\" after his blood type, the program, at 5 minutes per episode, was uploaded to his YouTube channel in May 2011 and gained more than five million views in the first three months alone. The show was shot in Youssef's laundry room using a table, a chair, one camera, and a mural of amateur photos from Tahrir Square that cost $100. The show was a collaboration by Youssef with Tarek ElKazzaz, Amr Ismail, Mohamed Khalifa, and Mostafa Al-Halawany. Youssef used social media to showcase his talent and his show gave a voice to the millions of Egyptians who were seething with anger from the traditional media's coverage of the Egyptian Revolution.\n\nAfter the success of \"The B+ Show\", Egyptian channel ONTV, owned by Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris, offered Youssef a deal for \"Al Bernameg\" (literally, \"The Program\"). With a budget of roughly half a million dollars, the series made him the first Internet to TV conversion in the Middle East. The show, which consisted of 104 episodes, premiered during Ramadan 1432 (2011) with Egyptian-American engineer Muhammad Radwan as its first guest. In his show, Youssef has parodied such Egyptian celebrities as show host Tawfik Okasha, composer Amr Mostafa, Salafist presidential candidate Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, and Mohamed ElBaradei, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and onetime presidential candidate. The show became the platform for many writers, artists, and politicians to speak freely about the social and political scene. \"Al-Bernameg\"'s success inspired a number of amateur initiatives on various social media channels, who credit \"The B+ Show\" as their inspiration.\n\nIn June 2012, Jon Stewart invited Youssef to \"The Daily Show\" for an extended interview, \"...I do know a little something about the humour business; your show is sharp, you're really good on it, it's smart, it's well executed, I think the world of what you're doing down there,\" Stewart said to Youssef. The segment was one of the highest in viewership on the \"Daily Show\"s website.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The B+ Show\" on YouTube and the first season of \"Al-Bernameg\" on ONTV, Tarek ElKazzaz convinced an old friend, Ahmed Abbas, to join QSoft as chief operations officer and Project Director for \"Al-Bernameg\" with the mission of developing and upgrading the show into a multifaceted and global brand. This was done with the help of a team that covered many disciplines, including marketing, operations, legal and public relations. This all helped in developing both Bassem Youssef and \"Al-Bernameg\" on all levels and created a global audience. The show \"Al Bernameg\" was renewed for a second season after a contract with a second channel, CBC (Capital Broadcast Center), which premiered on November 23, 2012. The second season consisted of 29 episodes and has recorded one of the highest viewership ratings on both TV and internet with 40 million viewers on TV and more than 184 million combined views for his show on YouTube alone. Just three episodes into the show, several lawsuits were filed against Bassem Youssef and his show, mainly for \"insult and defamation\". On the season's premiere, Youssef made the owner and coworkers of his channel the subject of his show, as an assurance that he is granted full freedom of expression, and that no topic was off limits. CBC did not, however, air his second episode, which also featured further criticism of a TV show host who filed a lawsuit against Youssef. The show returned to its regular schedule for the third episode.\n\nThe program, which began with a small group working at home with Youssef, moved from ONTV's smallest studio to Radio theater in downtown Cairo, a theatre redesigned in the likeness of New York's Radio City, making it the first live audience show in the Middle East. The contents of a typical show's broadcast have evolved, which began with a sarcastic take on current political events, and eventually incorporating the hosting of public figures and stars from various fields, as well as various artists' performances.\nIn November 2012, \"Al-Bernameg\" moved from ONTV's smallest studio to Radio Theatre in Cairo's downtown. Following the move, Youssef succeeded in increasing the show's worth by eight times in one year. The second season, which premiered in November 2012 on CBC network, was the first real live audience show in Egypt. The show gained tremendous success through its criticism of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, representing the Muslim Brotherhood. Soon after the show started airing, complaints were filed against Youssef, accusing him of insulting Islam, Morsi and disrupting public order and peace.\n\nIn March 2013, Bassem Youssef started writing a weekly column expressing his views for \"Al-Shorouk\"; one of Egypt's most prominent and independent daily newspapers.\n\nYoussef also wrote newspaper columns, where he tackled taboo subjects such as atheism and questioning the commonly held view that apostasy from Islam should be punishable by death. On March 18, 2014, he faced plagiarism accusations by his readers, and through Twitter, by the original British writer, Ben Judah, who wrote the article for \"Politico\" magazine. He later published an apology in \"El Sherouk\" newspaper for initially publishing an article without citing any references.\n\nAs \"Al-Bernameg\" continued with its growing success, Jon Stewart appeared as a guest on the show in June 2013.\n\nOn 1 July 2013 \"America in Arabic\" (United Arab Emirates) debuted. He appeared for the second time on \"The Daily Show \"with Jon Stewart.\n\nAfter a four-month break, Youssef appeared on air in October 2013, with a show that stirred much controversy and criticism. In response to the popular criticism and discontent the show caused, CBC, the show's broadcaster, distanced itself from the show and its creators, and decided to stop airing it on its channels. Meanwhile, more than 30 complaints against Youssef and the show were filed at the General Prosecutor's office, accusing him of insulting the Egyptian Armed Forces and President Adly Mansour and describing the June 30 protests as a military coup, in addition to disrupting public order and peace. The General Prosecutor transferred some of the complaints for investigation, which were subject to the prosecutor's decision and judgment.\n\nAfter terminating the contract with CBC, the production company behind \"Al Bernameg\" received offers from different TV channels. The third season was scheduled to air during the first quarter of 2014. In February 2014 it was announced that Youssef had signed a deal with the Middle East Broadcasting Center and that they would start broadcasting \"Al Bernameg\" from 7 February on MBC MASR. However the program was suspended by MBC during the 2014 Egyptian presidential election campaign, and in June 2014 Youssef announced that he was ending \"Al-Bernameg\" as he felt that the political climate in Egypt was too dangerous to continue the show.\n\nAfter a four-month break, \"Al Bernameg\" returned to air for its third series on 25 October 2013. The season premiere marked the first broadcast for the show since the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état had deposed Mohamed Morsi from the Egyptian presidency. Youssef criticised both the Morsi administration and the people's idolization of the Egyptian Defense Minister Abdul Fatah al-Sisi. The following day the CBC network issued a statement distancing the channel from the political stance taken by Youssef. The CBC network issued another statement, and decided to stop broadcasting \"Al Bernameg\" because of violations in the contract signed.\n\n\"Al-Bernameg\" reappeared on MBC Masr satellite channel on February 7, 2014, achieving unprecedented weekly viewership ratings for 11 consecutive weeks. In June 2014, and after a six-week break, the \"Al-Bernameg\" team held a press conference where Youssef announced the termination of the show due to pressure on both the show and the airing channel.\n\nIn January 2015, Harvard's Institute of Politics (IOP), at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, announced that Youssef would be a resident fellow for the spring semester.\n\nIn February 2015, it was announced that Youssef was collaborating with \"The Daily Show\" producer Sara Taksler to launch a crowd-funding campaign for her documentary about his experience, \"Tickling Giants\". The movie launched in March 2017.\n\nIn November 2015, Bassem hosted the 43rd International Emmy Awards in New York City.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Youssef had reached a deal with Fusion to produce a digital series, \"Democracy Handbook with Bassem Youssef\". The show premiered online and in a one-hour broadcast special in mid-July 2016.\n\n\"Tickling Giants\", a documentary film about Bassem Youssef directed by Sara Taksler, was released in 2016. In 2017 Youssef guest-starred in the \"DuckTales\" reboot episode \"The Living Mummies of Toth-Ra!\" as the titular pharaoh.\n\nThe podcast \"Remade in America\" debuted In early 2018, in which Youssef explores the cultural, political, and social nuances of America from an outsider's perspective.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, the daily \"Al-masry Al-youm\" reported that an Egyptian prosecutor was investigating Bassem Youssef on charges of maligning President Mohammed Morsi, whose office claimed that Youssef's show was \"circulating false news likely to disturb public peace and public security and affect the administration.\"\n\nDespite all of the controversy it sparks, \"Al Bernameg\" has been a major success. It is constantly topping the regional YouTube charts, making Bassem Youssef's YouTube channel the most subscribed to in Egypt.\n\nOn 30 March 2013, an arrest warrant was issued for Youssef for allegedly insulting Islam and Morsi. The move was seen by opponents as part of an effort to silence dissent against Morsi's government. Youssef confirmed the arrest warrant on his Twitter account and said he would hand himself in to the prosecutor's office, jokingly adding, \"Unless they kindly send a police van today and save me the transportation hassle.\" The following day, he was questioned by authorities before being released on bail of 15,000 Egyptian pounds. The event sparked international media attention as well as a segment on Jon Stewart's \"The Daily Show\" in which he declared his support for Youssef, calling him a \"friend\" and \"brother\".\n\nAfter \"Al Bernameg\" ended, the Egyptian police raided the offices of the production company, arresting several employees and confiscating their computers. According to Youssef, the police told producer Amr Ismail that they would continue harassing the company if Youssef did not stop speaking publicly at international conferences. The Egyptian courts then levied a E£50 million fine against Youssef in a contract dispute with CBC. In the verdict, the courts condemned satirical television shows and implied that Youssef was disrupting the peace and inciting public unrest. Fearing he would be arrested if he stayed in Egypt, Youssef fled to Dubai in November 2014.\n\nIn 2013, Youssef was named one of the \"100 most influential people in the world\" by \"TIME\" magazine and one of Foreign Policy magazine's 100 Leading Global Thinkers.\n\nIn November 2013, Youssef's role in the media was recognized by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which awarded him with the International Press Freedom Award, along with three other journalists.\n\nIn 2015, Youssef received an honorary degree and delivered the commencement address for the College of Online & Continuing Education at Southern New Hampshire University.\n\n\"Al Bernameg\" was chosen by South by Southwest, one of the largest international interactive festivals, as the first and most successful internet to TV conversion story in the Middle East. \"Al Bernameg\"s YouTube channel was the first channel in the MENA region to reach one million subscribers and was awarded the gold button trophy.\n\nYoussef lives in the Bay Area with his wife, an Egyptian-Palestinian, and their son and daughter. He worked as a cardiothoracic surgeon when \"Al Bernameg\" was on hiatus. In his capacity as a doctor, he assisted wounded Tahrir Square protesters after the Battle of the Camel. Youssef is a Muslim.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Canadiens' first Stanley Cup championship team in 1916. His brother Con also played professional ice hockey.\n\nCorbeau played junior hockey for the Penetang Hockey Club from 1910 until 1912, when he moved up to the Penetang intermediate team. Corbeau signed as a professional with the Halifax Crescents in 1913, playing one season before signing with the Montreal Canadiens in 1914. Corbeau would be a member of the Canadiens until October 1922 when he was traded to the Hamilton Tigers for cash. In December 1923, he became a member of the Toronto St. Pats as part of a trade. He stayed with the Toronto franchise and was one of the original Toronto Maple Leafs before being waived in October 1927. He then played two seasons in the minor Canadian Professional Hockey League with Toronto Ravinia and the London Panthers before retiring as a player. From 1928 to 1929 he coached the Panthers and then for a decade was an NHL referee. Corbeau then returned to coaching with the Atlantic City Sea Gulls of the Eastern Hockey League from 1939 to 1942.\n\nCorbeau finally left hockey and returned to Penetanguishene, where he lived and worked as a plant superintendent at the Midland Foundry and Machine Company (supporting Canada in World War II) until his death from a boating accident.\n\nCorbeau was the first player to play for both the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs. In the 1926–27 season, he became the first player to record 100 minutes in penalties in one season. He was posthumously inducted into the Penetanguishene Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\n\nCorbeau died as the result of a boating accident in Georgian Bay. During a party hosted by Corbeau aboard his boat, the boat struck a sand bar. Portholes on the sides of the boat were open and water entered the boat through them, sinking the boat within a matter of minutes. Of the 42 persons aboard, 25 died, including Corbeau.\n\nA collectible hockey card featuring Corbeau from the 1923–24 season is one of the rarest cards in existence. Only a handful were made by a company that featured them in a contest. Contestants who collected a complete set of 40 cards were awarded a pair of skates. The Corbeau card was \"short printed\" in order to limit the number of winners.\n"}

Engravings of his photographs were widely used on British and British Commonwealth postage stamps, currency, and other official documents in the 1930s. His theatrical portraits were the source for two paintings by Walter Sickert. With his wife Yvonne Gregory, he also produced a number of photographic books of the female nude. He was an expert in the cultivation of the rose and the editor of \"The Rose Annual\".\n\nBertram Charles Percival Park was born in Minster, Kent, England, in 1883 to Charles Percival Park and Katharine Mary Park. He initially worked in the family firm which made artist's materials.\n\nIn 1916, Park married the photographer Yvonne Gregory (1889-1970) at Hampstead, and she became one of his principal models. They had a daughter, Hilary June Park, who was born in Hampstead in 1920. Hilary, known as June, was an architect who married David Francis Rivers Bosanquet in 1941 and divorced him in 1947. Her second marriage was to the Finnish architect Cyril Mardall (1909-1994) in 1947.\n\nIn 1910, Bertram Park was one of the founders of the London Salon of Photography. In 1919, with funding from the Egytologist Lord Carnarvon, he established studios at 43 Dover Street, London, with his wife Yvonne and the children's photographer Marcus Adams. They shared darkroom staff and facilities and were known as the \"Three Photographers\".\n\nPark's work included British and European royalty and in 1927 he was made an MBE. In the 1939 Birthday Honours he was made up to OBE. His images were widely used on British and British Commonwealth postage stamps, currency, and other official documents in the 1930s.\n\nPark and Gregory were also noted for their publicity photographs for theatrical productions. In 1924 they photographed the first English production of George Bernard Shaw's \"Saint Joan\" starring Sybil Thorndike.\n\nIn 1932, Walter Sickert produced his portrait of the actress \"Miss Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as Isabella of France\", (\"La Louve\"), directly from a Park photograph without taking any sittings with Ffrangcon-Davies, although they were closely acquainted. The source was acknowledged by Sickert in an inscription on the painting. Park's photograph was in black and white so Sickert was obliged to add colour to the painting, however, he used a restricted palette causing the critic Frank Rutter to describe the work as \"practically a monochrome\". Sickert also greatly enlarged the proportions, resulting in a finished work of 245 x 92 cm. Unusually, the Tate Gallery acquired the painting the same year after a fund-raising campaign to buy it for the gallery led by the Tate's director, James Bolivar Manson. Sickert joked that it was \"only bought for the Tate because of Bertram Park. Another proof that honesty is the best policy\".\n\nIn 1934, Park and Gregory produced publicity photographs for a production of \"Hamlet\" at the New Theatre, London, one of which was the basis for Walter Sickert's 1935 painting \"Jessica Tandy and John Gielgud in Hamlet\". In 1935 they photographed Gielgud's \"Romeo and Juliet\" in which Gielgud and Laurence Olivier exchanged the roles of Romeo and Mercutio.\n\nPark and Gregory's theatrical portraits form part of the University of Bristol Theatre Collection.\n\nPark also produced a number of photographic books featuring the female nude and supplied photographs to naturist publications. One of his models was the 1950s glamour model Pamela Green.\n\nOutside photography, Park was a Commandant in the Metropolitan Special Constabulary and was noted as such in 1927 and 1939.\n\nPark was an expert on the cultivation of the rose about which he wrote many books. He was the editor of \"The Rose Annual\" and in 1957 a review in the American Institute of Biological Sciences described his \"The Guide to Roses\", for which he also provided the photographs, as \"the last word on roses\".\n\nIn later life, Park lived in Pinner, Middlesex, in a house whose grounds he used as a setting for his photography. He died in Pinner in 1972, leaving an estate of £103,322 net. In 1984, his daughter June presented the National Post Museum with an album of 25 pages that Park had created in the late 1940s of his photographs and the stamps based upon them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

S. Henderson, was half Scottish and half of the Irish family of Newenham: his mother was a Carus-Wilson from Westmorland. Both, however, were born and bred in Cornwall, and a portion of Cornish ancestry came to him through his mother's mother, one of the Willyamses of Carnanton in Mawgan-in-Pydar.\n\nHe was at Wellington College for a short time but left on account of ill-health. For this reason he was frequently sent home from school for rest, and spent a large amount of his time walking over Cornwall and studying Cornish monuments and history. He collected a large number of documents from all over the county.\n\nHenderson went to New College, Oxford and took his degree with first-class honours in modern history in 1922. He was a lecturer at University College, Exeter, and afterwards at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was elected to an official fellowship as tutor in modern history in 1929. He had settled down at Oxford, and was showing great promise as a teacher and lecturer.\n\nIn 1928 Henderson published a book on Cornish bridges in collaboration with Henry Coates. Whenever he was able he would return to Cornwall and continue his historical research which in the early years was concerned very largely with the four western hundreds (Penwith, Kerrier, Pydar and Powder) but finally he planned a parochial history of the whole county on a grand scale.\n\nOn 19 June 1933, he married (Mary) Isobel Munro, a fellow of Somerville College and daughter of J A R Munro, the Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford; at the end of August, he set out with her for southern Italy. He had been troubled for some months with pains in his chest and they attacked him severely at Monte Sant'Angelo on the Gargano, where he was visiting the shrine of the Cornish patron St Michael. He died in Rome eleven days later, on 24 September, of heart-failure following pleurisy.\n\nHe is buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, between the Porta San Paolo and Monte Testaccio, a place that he knew well: also in that cemetery are the graves of Keats, Shelley and Edward John Trelawny.\n\nHenderson’s publications included \"Cornwall; A Guide\" in collaboration with J. C. Tregarthen, in 1925; three books on Cornish churches; and another on Cornish coasts, moors, and valleys with notes on antiquities. In 1928 he was made a Bard of the Cornish Gorseth at Boscawen-Un, taking the bardic name \"Map Hendra\" ('Son of the Old Farmstead'). His collection of documents is held at the Courtney Library of the Royal Institution of Cornwall in Truro. The collection includes 16,000 ancient documents, many hundreds of transcripts in Henderson's hand, and his own writings either in published form or in manuscript.\n\nAfter completing his book on Cornish bridges, Henderson prepared notes for a similar book on the bridges of Devon. After his death the civil engineer Edwyn Jervoise completed the book and it was published in 1938.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for leading the Lingnan School's effort to modernize Chinese traditional painting as a \"new national art.\" Along with his brother Gao Qifeng and friend Chen Shuren, Gao Jianfu brought the nihonga style of painting to China.\n\nGao Jianfu was born in 1879 in the city of Canton, located in the Guangdong Province.\n\nWhen Gao Jianfu was thirteen, he entered the studio of Chinese artist Ju Lian in Lishan, and for the next seven years he acted as his apprentice. During his time with Ju Lian, Gao Jianfu painted in a similar style as his master: bright, colorful, and realistic. The subject matter of his paintings were mainly birds, flowers, and landscapes. At Ju Lian's studio, Gao Jianfu became close friends with Chen Shuren, a fellow artist.\n\nIn 1903, Gao Jianfu began working under the painter and collector Wu Deyi. Here he was introduced to works of the Chinese tradition.\n\nHe studied at the Canton Christian College, now known as Lingnan University. Two of his most influential instructors included \"a French teacher of painting only known by his Chinese name, Mai La,\" and Yamamoto Baigai, one of the many Japanese teachers then in China. Greatly inspired by his professors, Jianfu felt compelled to leave for Tokyo.\n\nIn the winter of 1906, Gao Jianfu left for Tokyo. After spending some time there and finding himself poor and without much food, he returned to Canton for the summer. In 1907, Jianfu returned to Tokyo with his nineteen-year-old brother, Gao Qifeng. They met up with their friend Chen Shuren.\n\nDuring his time in Japan, the three men were exposed to the nationalist debates \"then ranging in the Japanese art world over the modernizing impact of Western art on Japan's local artistic traditions.\" Jianfu became interested in the syntheses of Western and traditional approaches, which were parallel to work in the contemporary Japanese art world. Jianfu, along with his peers of the Lingnan School, saw this blend of styles as a model for modern national art. Many of the Lingnan students joined Sun Yat-sen's anti-Manchu movement, a revolutionary nationalist movement.\n\nJianfu once wrote: \"I think we should not only take in elements of Western painting. If there are good points in Indian painting, Egyptian painting, Persian painting, or masterpieces of other countries, we should embrace all of them too, as nourishment for Chinese painting.\"\n\nAlthough Jianfu was greatly interested in Western art and joined societies that promoted this style, his artwork during his time in Japan shows little influence of Western art. His art mainly reflects the work of nihonga painters like Kano Hogai, Hashimoto Gaho, and Takeuchi Seiho. Often Jianfu would paint flowers, plants, and grasses. He also took inspiration from traditional Chinese artists Tang Yin and Lan Ying.\n\nIn the 1920s, Jianfu's paintings showcased elements of \"realism derived from Western art,\" as well as traditional Chinese ink and brushwork. The subject matter of his work strayed away from the themes of traditional art (i.e. flowers, birds, landscapes, etc.) and focused more on contemporary reality.\n\nIn 1927 the connection between his art and political agenda was made clear with the unveiling of a new exhibit in Canton. The series of airplane paintings showcased a banner with Sun Yat-sen's slogan, \"Aviation to Save the Country.\" This propaganda can especially be seen in Jianfu's paintings, \"New Battlefield,\" \"Air Defense,\" and \"Flying in the Rain.\"\n\nThroughout his time in Macao during World War II, Jianfu painted \"Skulls Crying over the Nation's Fate.\" It depicted a pile skulls lying in a field of grass.\n\nIn 1912, after the overthrow of the Manchus, Gao Jianfu and his brother moved to Shanghai. They began publishing a journal titled \"Zhen xiang huabao\" (\"The True Record\"). It featured articles on art and politics, as well as published essays promoting a new, modernized national art in China. Although it ran for only a year, the journal was one of the first to bring art to the public. The brothers advocated government support of the arts. The two also opened the nation's first public galleries for the exhibit and sale of art works, the Aesthetic Bookstore.\n\nJianfu and Qifeng stayed in Shanghai till 1918. By 1923, the brothers established the Spring Awakening Art Academy in Canton.\n\nIn 1929, Jianfu was accused of anti-foreign sentiments during his time as the chief organizer of the government's first National Art Exhibition held in Nanjing. Because The Lingnan School was featured prominently, there was hostile response for the inclusion of non-Chinese artistic tendencies.\n\nIn 1936, Jianfu began teaching at Sun Yat-Sen University. He continued to publish articles, where he defended his concept of new national art. He suggested that national painting abandon the \"elitism\" of traditional art, and engage more directly with the Chinese public.\n\nIn 1938, Gao Jianfu left Japanese-occupied Canton for the island of Macao. He returned to Canton in 1945. At the time Mao Zedong came to power in 1949, Jianfu once again fled to Macao.\n\nHe died in 1951.\n\n\n"}

Mary Molesworth. The Rochfort family, originally called De Rupe Forti, had settled in Ireland in 1243. Sir Maurice de Rochfort was Lord Justice of Ireland in 1302. Gerald Rochfort was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1339. \nGeorge's great-grandfather was the prominent lawyer Robert Rochfort, Attorney General of Ireland and Speaker of the House of Commons in 1695, and Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1707. The family estate of Gaulstown lay on the shore of Lough Ennell in County Westmeath.\n\nGeorge's father, Robert Rochfort, was a favourite courtier of King George II of Great Britain. He was made an Irish peer as Baron of Bellfield in 1737, and then Earl of Belvedere in 1756. He was estranged from his mother for his of his childhood, after his father locked her away after an alleged affair with George's uncle, Arthur.\n\nFrom 1756 to 1774 George Rochfort was styled Viscount Belfield.\nHe was Member of Parliament for Philipstown from 1758–61, and Member of Parliament for Westmeath from 1761–1774.\nThe 1761 parliamentary election in County Westmeath followed the death of King George II of Great Britain.\nGeorge Rochfort, the Right Honorable Lord Belfield, won the election. He was supported by The Honorable Captain Richard Rochfort, Esq. and opposed by Mr. George Rochfort and Gustavus Lambert. The election thus seems to have been very much a family affair. Mr. George Rochfort supported the \"Patriots\", who demanded that parliaments last only seven years before being dissolved, rather than for the lifetime of the king, as was the custom.\n\nIn 1762 George Rochfort was Sheriff of County Westmeath, and from 1772 to 1814 he was a Governor of County Westmeath.\nAn anonymous writer named \"Dymoke\" published a \"Review of the House of Commons\" in the \"Freeman's Journal\" in 1774.\nThe purpose was to \"rouse the electors of Ireland to a due exertion of their lawful powers, and stimulate them to fix \non proper men to maintain their rights and privileges in parliament.\"\nHe noted that Belfield, who was muster-master-general of Ireland and a Governor of the County of Westmeath, had voted for the stamp act.\nDykmore declared that \"The present members [Lord Belfield; Anthony Malone] for the County of WESTMEATH will never represent it again, if the Electors have either sense, \nhonour, or remembrance\".\n\nOn 13 November 1774 Rochfort succeeded to the titles of Baron Belfield, Viscount Belfield and Earl of Belvedere after his father's death.\nHe released his mother.\nShe was prematurely aged, spoke in little more than a whisper but in a harsh, agitated and uneven manner, and was dressed in the style of thirty years earlier.\n\nFrom 1775–76 Rochfort was Grand Master of the Freemasons Grand Lodge of Ireland.\nOn 20 August 1775 he married Dorothea Bloomfield, daughter of John Bloomfield and Jane Jocelyn.\nGeorge Rochfort took his mother with him when he and his new wife visited the continent, but she found the travel too difficult. \nThey left her to recuperate in a convent in France while they visited Italy for a few months, spending the winter in Florence. \nThe next year the couple returned to London, where George's mother stayed with a friend in Kensington Palace for a year.\nShe then returned to Ireland and lived first with George in Dublin and then with his sister, now Countess of Lanesborough, and her young family. \nShe died a few years after her husband.\n\nRochfort had Belvedere House built on Great Denmark Street, Dublin, at the great sum of £24,000.\nThe site had been owned by Nicholas Archdall.\nThe building had been started by the first Earl, with Robert West as architect. Rochfort and his wife apparently did not plan to complete the work, and in 1777 offered it for sale. Later they decided to complete the house for their own use, and gave the job to Michael Stapleton.\nIt was finally completed and occupied in 1786, and probably stood alone at first, since in 1787 Rochfort was recorded as living in North Great George's Street.\nGeorge's mother is thought to have died there.\n\nDuring the struggle over the Acts of Union 1800, Rochfort's position on the union of the crowns of Britain and Ireland was uncertain. A letter of 25 January 1800 from Lord Altamont to the Earl of Lucan said \"Ld Belvedere has touched Government cash & possibly may not exert all his influence to give value in return for it.\"\n\nRochfort's first wife died on 6 April 1803, and on 10 November 1803 he married Jane Mackay, daughter of Reverend James Mackay.\nThey had one son, who died in infancy.\nGeorge Augustus Rochfort died in Great Denmark Street, Dublin on 13 May 1814 at the age of 75.\nHe is buried in St Sinian, Clonfad Parish Church, of the Church of Ireland. His tomb is adorned with a full-scale neoclassical sculptural group by John Bacon the younger. It represents the earl on his death bed, with his young wife weeping at the end. He is supported by Faith and an angelic figure is beckoning him to heaven.\n\nRochfort had no surviving children, and his three peerages became extinct.\nOn his death his sister Jane inherited the whole settled part of his great estate, since his brothers had died without children.\nHe left his entire unsettled estate to his wife. This consisted of at least 2,500 Irish acres, bringing in a large income. \nThe fortune was passed down to his wife's children by her second marriage.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}
{"id": "54083525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54083525", "title": "German childhood in World War II", "text": "German childhood in World War II\n\nGerman Childhood in World War II describes how the Second World War, as well as experiences related to it, directly or indirectly impacted the life of children born in that era. In Germany, these children became known as \"war children\", a term that came into use due to a large number of scientific and popular science publications which have appeared increasingly since the 1990s. They describe the same phenomena from different perspectives, using diverse methods and various stylistic means. The literature on this subject has not yet been able to produce a universal and binding definition. However, there is consensus that the impact of war on children can be felt decades later, often increasing with advancing age, and that at times the impact can be passed on \"mute\" to subsequent generations.\n\n“War does not stop when the weapons fall silent.” Into this simple formula German author Sabine Bode condensed the impact of war on human health. In 2015, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of Germany's capitulation and liberation from the Nazis – Victory in Europe Day – she had been invited by Phoenix (German TV station) to discuss “how we feel the war to this day” with respect to grandchildren of war. Together with Katrin Himmler, Randi Crott and Jens Orback, Sabine Bode participated in a round table discussion. None of the participants provided a definition of the two main terms, \"children of war\" and \"grand-children of war\". Katrin Himmler, however, named an important characteristic when she stated that “by far the most” war children in Germany were impacted “not only by the war”, but “also by the pedagogy of the National Socialists”. Author Matthias Lohre had already attempted a definition as early as 2014: “For those born between 1930 and 1945, the term war children has become understood as youth who were too young for direct participation in the war, but old enough to suffer from hunger, expulsion and bomb attacks, loss of family members, separation and fear of death.”\nThe concept is unquestionably aimed at a generation that spent part of its childhood in Germany during the Second World War, “for whom – without necessarily being threatened by organized annihilation – experiences of violence, separation and loss were, at least to some degree, impacting their life”. Not all authors agree which age groups to include. Some writers want to include children born shortly after the war because even in 1950, according to journalist Sabine Bode, “nine million children in West Germany lived in conditions that were inadequate, often unworthy for humans.” Years later, war children and their younger siblings still played in ruins left over from bombings. There is also no agreement at the other end of the scale as to what birth years to include. While Matthias Lohre and others include the children born in 1930, Michael Ermann restricts the term in his studies, referring to the “fate of the generation of non-Jewish Germans born in the Second World War”. Jewish children, who were neither deported nor murdered, are generally not included in this definition. For them the term \"survivors\" is used as they were exposed to additional and very specific threats to their lives which necessitated living in hiding. Anne Frank describes this in her book The Diary of Anne Frank which was published in German in 1950.\nIt can not be assumed that the term has comparable meanings in languages of other European countries. For example, the English term \"war children\", as well as the French term \"enfant de la guerre\", define the concept narrower, as a synonym for \"Besatzungskind\" – a child of a native mother and a father who is member of an occupying military force – describing implications associated with that situation.\n\nAdditional terms describing the various aspects and experiences of the war child generation, besides \"Besatzungskind\", have been developed in Germany as well. These include, for example, the children of Lebensborn (an association in Nazi Germany whose goal was to raise the birth rate of racially pure Aryan children), the children of forced laborers, or the so-called Wolf children who grew up without parents in the Baltics and had to hide their origins. Additional issues were raised with respect to war orphans or children of war-related rape. Further, the high number of children of married parents who had lost their father in the war or had never met him represent another group which has specific characteristics, as well as those children who had not met their fathers until after the end of the war or after their release from prisoner of war camps.\n\nAn extensive amount of literature deals specifically with the fate of Jewish children, like the Kindertransport which brought Jewish children to the UK, the rescue of Jewish children by Youth Aliyah Child Rescue, or the support of these children by the \"Swiss charity organization for emigrant children\".\n\nFinally, there is another group of children who are usually not considered \"war children\" because of their special affiliation with Heimatvertriebene, Germans who were foreced to flee after being expelled from areas that became part of other countries during post-war restructuring. These expellees were, in contrast to the war children in general, a “public topic” during the post-war period “in the West of the divided country.” Still another group are the war children of the First World War. They are generally not included in the relevant literature, although they should also be considered as such.\n\nAfter years of efforts to bring together what the \"war children\" have in common, psychoanalyst Michael Ermann, in his farewell lecture on the occasion of his retirement in March 2009, came to the following conclusion: “The 'German war children' do not exist. Their fates are much too diverse. [...] All of this requires individual consideration rather than a generalization.” But if there is something that “connects the different fates – the ones in the East, the West, the North and the South, the children of the night bombings and the refugee children” – then it would be a striking “lack of fright and consternation about one's own fate!”\n\nIn 2003 – almost sixty years after the end of the war – Ermann, who describes himself as a “typical war child”, launched \"Project War Childhood\" at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He was joined by a prominent international scientific advisory board. In 2009 the project was completed with a series of scientific publications.\n\"The Inability to Mourn\", a book published by Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich in 1967 that deals with the consequences of the war experience, found broad public attention among Germans. Even though the authors were primarily focusing on adults, they provided an impetus for later research on \"war children\" where the symptoms described by the Mitscherlichs were also found. The inability to mourn, they wrote, had produced a behaviour based on “denial” which may have led to “self-confidence more uncertain than it could have been.”\n\nIt was not until the late 1980s, after 20 more years had passed, that the topic of \"childhood of war\" came into the public discourse in Germany. Why so much time had to pass is attributed to various factors. Ermann recalls “feelings of guilt [...] as a result of the Holocaust” and the “refusal to remember during the years of the Wirtschaftswunder”, the economic miracle after the war. Finally, “trauma-specific defense mechanisms” should be taken into account. The journalist Hilke Lorenz said that the war children had fallen into a “history gap”. And the author Alexandra Senfft, the granddaughter of the war criminal Hanns Ludin, recalled the taboos: “To deal with the crimes of one's own relatives hurts, it makes you afraid and sad.” Even “thinking about the worst was a taboo in my family”.\n\n“Politically more volatile” was probably the feared “accusation by Shoa survivors” that “looking at war children” could lead to “relativize the murder of the Jews”. In 2005, at the first interdisciplinary conference in Frankfurt – which had devoted itself to the war children – the representative of the Jewish congregation “distanced himself” from such a proposal. The answer clarified that “it was not a matter of opening up a ‘victim competition’ but, on the contrary, classifying one's own differentiated experiences into the European memory, as well as identifying the suffering due to the silencing of the ‘deeds’ by the parent generation.” It is no coincidence therefore that Sabine Bode – in her book about \"grand-children of war\" – addressed the question of “how perpetrators became victims”. in a separate section.\nPsychological testing was absent in the discussion until 1980 when the diagnosis of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was included in the DSM III, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Within less than 10 years thereafter, the publications on the psychological consequences of war on childhood increased in Germany. Since then, numerous authors have reported very personal accounts about their own childhood, have accepted this subject more generally, or have begun to publish scientific studies.\n\nBode noted that while 70 years after the end of the war an “academic review” had taken place – by representatives of various scientific disciplines – but that only recently an “emotional process” had begun. Katrin Himmler is also convinced that “we have not yet processed this within families”. Anyone who tries to do this will sooner or later be confronted with the question of their own identity. Christa Müller drew attention to the fact that the “path to a mature national as well as individual identity [...] requires a self-critical examination of the far-reaching influences of the events in National Socialist Germany, in the Second World War and in the post-war period”. For Raed Saleh, a German politician, the discussions about the term revolve around a question that “remains unresolved”: “How does Germany define its national identity”? He suggests that we would have to “redefine” it:\n“Politicians of the Alternative for Germany party are demanding to end memory culture in Germany, and they are not the only ones.” On February 18, 2017, during a radio program titled \"There must be an end to it – Remembrance Culture in Germany\" – Ulrich Gineiger published a report about the pros and cons of this issue. In this report, representatives of both positions were heard. In the foreground were “older people [...] who spoke about their traumatic experiences during the Nazi regime” as well as how they remembered it in later years. In addition, the heads of various cultural institutions and memorial sites talked about their experiences with their visitors. The project Stolpersteine (Stumbling Blocks) by the artist Gunter Demnig which is receiving international attention also played a role in the documentation.\n\nThe raising of children and youth during the National Socialist era was the lens through which not all, but most war children in Germany experienced the war and its affects. In 1934 one of the most powerful publishing houses of that period released a guidebook by Johanna Haarer – one of the well-known Women in Nazi Germany – on the topic of infant care. This book, \"The German Mother and her First Child\", was in its tenth edition at the end of the war. It is still on the market, with changes that obscure its origin and ideology, not revealing the year of its first appearance. In her critical analysis of this and another book on child-rearing by Haarer, Sigrid Chamberlain concludes that child-raising and education in Nazi Germany and the early post-war years are characterized by coldness, harshness, and indifference. She views these theories as a “seamless transition into the ideology and the institutions of the Nazi state”, stating that it is “time” to deal with the fact that “the majority of those born during the Third Reich and the post-war years were released into life with early Nazi ideology, without ever realizing this fact and its possible consequences.“ In 1977 the concept of “Black Pedagogy”, introduced by sociologist Katharina Rutschky, was established, summarizing – among other concepts – the child-raising and educational methods of this period.\n\nWhile Chamberlain had investigated the question of how it was possible to carry the ideology of the time into the nurseries, Hans-Peter de Lorent has been researching the socialization in the educational systems since the 1980s. Already politically active as a student, he recalls that “in 1968, for example, as speaker of the student counsel, I called for participation in the \"Sternmarsch\", a march into Bonn – then the German capital – to protest against the proposed German Emergency Acts”. In 1981 as “editor of the Hamburger Lehrerzeitung”, a magazine for teachers, he had begun “to publish a series called \"Schooling under the Swastika\"” that dealt specifically with teachers who “resisted” the Nazi regime. In 1991, in a review of a book by Lutz van Dijk about resistance of teachers during the Nazi era, the educational scientist Reiner Lehberger stated that, as early as 1936, 97 per cent of teachers belonged to the Nazi Teachers Association and 32 per cent were members of the Nazi Party.\n\nVan Dijk's critical view of the twelve years of the Nazi era shows – according to Lehberger – that in the early years, “expressions of indignation [...] were mostly punished with reprimands\", whereas “during the war they were considered as 'Wehrkraftzersetzung'”, subversion of the war effort, and “not rarely endowed with the death penalty.”\n\nIn 2016, after years of research, using the city of Hamburg as an example, de Lorent published an 800-page book on the profiles of those teachers who taught war and post-war children in the schools of Germany. As a former school superintendent he was able to draw on earlier contacts who became very helpful in his research. Based on the profiles of 42 teachers, De Lorent not only described generally how “Nazi teachers made a career after the war”, but he also described details, using a Hamburg physical education teacher as an example, who had lit synagogues during the Nazi period and who beat his students after the war The fact that pupils were still beaten by their teachers in the post-war years was not an exception, but the rule. “The so-called De-nazification had largely failed in the school system”, wrote journalist Uwe Bahnsen in his discussion of de Lorent's book.\n\nFurther information about the socialization of children during the Nazi period can be found in two online portals. In addition to the \"NS Documentation Centre\", the city of Cologne has put the \"Nazi Youth Project\" on the web. In this way, a vast amount of richly compiled historical material regarding the Second World War is made accessible to the general public. On the page \"Youth in Germany 1918 – 1945\", the various efforts to influence the war children – such as in schools, camps, or the deportation of children – are brought together, dedicating a chapter to each topic. The collaborative portal \"Lebendiges Museum Online (LeMO)\", Living Museum Online provides, in addition to other topics, thousands of pages, pictures, audio and video files about the Second World War and the post-war years, among them, for example, the poster \"Youth Serves the Leader\". The post-war years, described as \"collapsed society\" are documented under the title \"Life in Ruins\".\n\n“What would be the proportion of those who experienced horrible things and those who were lucky”, Bode asked in 2009, four years after the Congress In Frankfurt. According to Bode, the experts had been struggling since then “to come to estimate that one half had a normal childhood and the other half had not”. For the latter group, it was assumed that 25 per cent [experienced] “short-term or isolated trauma and that a further 25 per cent were exposed to persistent and multiple traumatizing experiences.”\n\nAccording to Bauer, “many war children still seem to be striving to explain their war experiences as trivial and normal”. This is an almost unanimous conclusion, in the media as well as in science and research. Matthias Lohre collected “typical phrases”, like “that's the way it was” or “everyone experienced that”, used by war children to regularly play down their own experiences. Ermann calls it the “speechlessness” of war children, that he sees as “a counterpart to the lack of interest” by the public towards this fate.\n\nErmann refers in this context to a “myth of invulnerability of children”. It was linked to the “ideology of heroism in National Socialism” which in an “unspoken way resonated in the processing of the Second World War, the Nazi period, and in post-war Germany. 'German' children are born to withstand hardship, and these children are not vulnerable. But if they are harmed, then they are not seen in their pain and suffering, but in their bravery with which they overcome their injuries.”\n\nThe reality was different, as psychoanalyst Luise Reddemann reported in detail in her lecture in Bad Krozingen in 2006. And it was different for each of the war children. They brought with them individual preconditions and lived in different parts of Germany which were not all equally affected by the war. While some cities were laid in ruins and ashes, others were spared. While some children experienced hunger, there was enough food in other places. While some survived firestorms, others did not know what that was. Not everyone knew about the nights in the bunkers during the air raids, not all were bombed, entombed by debris or lost their physical integrity. Those who were surrounded by family experienced the war differently from those who were left abandoned after the loss of family. Some children witnessed the rape of their mother or sister. And those whose homeland was preserved could not imagine the distress of the expellees. Unknown is the number of children who were not spared the experience of death. “That's the way it was.” Close your eyes and get through – was the motto.\n\nWhen the war was over, the war children were confronted with their growing insight into the culpable entanglement of the parent generation. Emerging questions met denial or reactions of guilt and shame. Through the media they learned about the Nuremberg trials and were also witnessing societal efforts to restore a kind of normality which looked very different in the two parts of the country after the division of Germany.\n\nIn addition to Bode, Ermann considers the war children to be a “generation of the inconspicuous” that has “produced only a small number of significant personalities”. Beyond such a view on the consequences of war on individual children – a fairly typical one – some authors also look at the possible societal consequences. One of these authors is Lloyd deMause. As a pioneer and one of the most important representatives of Psychohistory – a theory which is considered controversial – he connected the individual experience of the war children to the consequences that have broader societal impact. In several publications he analyzed the “expression of childhood trauma in politics” and came to the following daring conclusion:\nA vacancy in the literature regarding the war children remains. Neither Ermann nor other authors refer to the fact that the war generation and the generation of the so-called Counterculture of the 1960s movement have common experiences. Rudi Dutschke, one of their most prominent representatives, was a war child.\n\nThe war children's experiences before the war, and their various experiences during the war are different for each of them. Yet, despite such diversity, there are similarities which characterize them. Age plays an important role in the processing of experiences. Andrea Bauer summarized the results of various studies and concluded that “children between 5 and 9 years of age experience the greatest vulnerability as they are very aware of the events, but do not yet have sufficient coping strategies”. Moreover, Bauer states that children interpret their experience “more through the direct contact with their reference persons” rather than through “the event itself” – and how the reference persons “explain the events to the child, and in turn, how they interpret them for themselves”.\n\nIn addition to the characteristics of war children already described, various features or symptoms can be identified. However, there are subgroups of war children about whom we still know “nothing”, German psychoanalyst Hartmut Radebold said in an interview in 2010. He mentioned, as an example, “the children who have been sent across Europe to protect them from the war” or those “who were placed into orphanages after the war”. In 2014, the German TV station Südwestrundfunk provided little-known details about the childhood of some war children with the publication of two documentaries. On December 7, 2014, a documentary film by Ina Held, titled \"Journey Into an Intact World: German War Children in Switzerland\" was broadcast. These children were often called “Swiss Children”. Subsequently, Gerd Böhmer published the film “Escape Routes – When Jewish Refugees Wanted to Go to Switzerland”. He had made this film together with students from Lörrach in order to “revisit the topic and create cross-generational interest”.\n\nAt times Ermann speaks of “quirks” when describing typical experiences or behaviors of war children. When these behaviours do not have symptomatic characteristics, they have long been regarded as personal whims rather than the consequences of war experiences.\nIn addition, a number of “abnormalities” were found – also below the threshold which makes people seek professional help – such as “feelings of unfamiliarity” or “relationship disorders” or even a “feeling of great emptiness”, and the “impression not to live one's own life, standing beside oneself somehow”. “Early parentification” is occasionally mentioned, as well as an “oppressive sense of responsibility”. Often the experiences of the war had “crept into the sense of identity as blind spots”, Sabine Bode noted. In this context, she pointed to protective factors: “Most of the war children succeeded in keeping their memories of fright at bay, especially by immersing themselves in work.” Luise Reddemann also recalled factors that protect them: “While it is true that traumatic experiences can cause damage and leave scars, it is also true that resilience can prevent people from carrying life-long trauma-induced injuries. These factors should not be overlooked, as has happened for a long time.”\n\nRadebold, who sees himself as a war child, reminds of “the so-called egosyntonic behavior[s] of the war children. These are behaviours we all know: being thrifty, working hard and diligently, planning, organizing, being altruistic, looking after others and not oneself”. But, on the other hand, they “did not learn to take care of their body”.\n\nSome war children became ill, some recovered, others did not. Still others experienced first symptoms later, at an advanced age. According to Ermann, war children “as adults are generally more at risk of suffering from psychological disorders than others”. Even losing the conscious memory does not guarantee protection from illness. \"The Body Does Not Forget\" was the title of an article based on a comment by Erman, published by the German magazine Der Spiegel in 2009.\n\nAt the Frankfurt Congress in 2005, psychoanalyst and author Marianne Leuzinger-Bohleber spoke about a long-term study in which several scientists participated, stating that it had shown “a higher than expected” number of patients suffering from consequences of the war: “Long-term physical damage due to poor nutrition, problems with self-care, psychosomatic complaints, loneliness, escape into achievement, empathy disorders, identity, and relationship disorders.”\n\nBesides Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – which many authors view as a possible consequence of war – Ermann added “latent symptoms” which he had identified in preparation for his research project: “Many still have nightmares of attacks, traps, violence, struggle, escape. Others are torn from sleep with an ancient feeling for which they have a personal formula: 'The Russians are coming'. Others experience depression, low confidence, anxiety, somatization or conversion. There are sometimes strange symptoms: feeling cold or recurring fever, agitation and restlessness or sudden panic, numbness, or the feeling of being out of control. Today we recognize in such symptoms the traces of flight-or-fight responses, recurring memories that express themselves in the body, memories of the incomprehensible.” For decades, before the development of the trauma concept, all of these symptoms have been traditionally described as “hysterical desire neurosis” or they were traced to “hereditary vulnerability”.\n\nOne year after the Frankfurt Congress in 2005, psychoanalyst Luise Reddemann addressed her younger colleagues during a lecture regarding therapeutic consequences:\nIn 2015, Luise Reddemann's book about psychotherapy regarding children of war and grandchildren of war was published. There she addressed the question of how the consequences of a childhood during war can be recognized and dealt with in detail.\n\nErmann contributes, among other reasons, the fact that this topic is “researched and debated” 70 years later to the age of war children. He states that “neuro-physiological processes” are making memories “that have been hidden for a long time re-appear”. He is stating further that “psychological defences collapse” as a result of age, and “everything that has been protective for decades – a person's family and job – disappears”.\n\nThe second interdisciplinary congress about war children took place in Münster in 2013, eight years after the first one. Among the many topics discussed, the age of the war children was addressed as well. If “life experience – beyond all research – teaches that remembering characterizes old age”, Insa Fooken, a German professor focusing on aging, confirmed this general knowledge from the perspective of developmental psychology. “It is often not until old age that the full extent of the consequences becomes visible.”\n\nRadebold, as Ermann, has researched war children and specializes in the psychotherapy of the elderly. He wondered how the war children would cope “when they become older, eventually needing care or support, and thus having to give up their independence”. He reminded “professional groups working in psycho-social and old-age related fields” of the urgent need to “provide updated knowledge and information”.\n\nIn 2013, German broadcaster ARD presented a documentary by Dorothe Dörholt about war children in old age. Journalist Thilo Wydra titled this programme in the German newspaper Tagesspiegel \"Unforgettable, Unprocessed: The Fear in One's Head\". German TV station Phönix broadcast a rerun in 2015, focusing on the return of traumatizing experiences in old age: “One third of German pensioners was seriously traumatized during the war. Many of them are helplessly exposed to images and memories of war which are reappearing in old age.” War-related traumata and anxiety-provoking memories are now being addressed in old age homes. “Historical knowledge” is necessary and “not leaving old people alone or lonely” – is the belief of one caregiver for the elderly. An online platform by the name \"Age and Trauma – Giving Space to the Unheard\" is addressing “elderly people, their relatives, professionals and institutions” by embracing the trauma of old people in general and the war children of the Second World War specifically, recognizing that time does not heal all wounds. The project \"Old People and Traumata – Understanding, Testing and Multiplication of Interventions and Training Opportunities\", was funded by the \"Ministry of Health, Emancipation, Care and Old Age\" of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, between 2013 and 2016.\n\nThe shadows of the past are still noticeable in generations following the war children. Some of the descendants now call themselves \"grand-children of war\" for they have long since realized that they are burdened by something, even though they have grown up protected and prosperous. According to Matthias Lohre, it is high time that generations of war children and grandchildren “come to talk about the experiences of hardship, death and helplessness” before more of the war children are dying. “Yet, the Germans who survived the Second World War as children seemed almost indestructible.”\n\nThe more the \"topic war children\" became public, the more organizations in several locations in Germany have been founded, focusing on this subject. Some have since disappeared, others have been launched. Probably all of them can be found on the Internet, but not every website is an organization. Some of them are self-help groups with the goal to support, promote contacts, or organize group discussions. Some are directed exclusively to \"war children\" or grandchildren of war, while others address both groups. Typically these organizations consider those born after 1950 to be the grandchildren of war, although many of them are brothers and sisters of the war children and do not belong to the next generation. Other organizations have primarily devoted themselves to the support of scientific research.\n\nThe following films have not been translated into the English language.

At bear bile farms, bile is extracted from the bear's gallbladder for use in traditional Chinese medicines. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, only about 15,000–20,000 Asiatic black bears are alive in the wild in China, which would qualify them for the highest protection described by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Chinese authorities estimate that over 50,000 of the bears live in the wild, which would eliminate the necessity for higher protection.\n\nProfessor Peter Li believes that Robinson \"single-handedly alerted the world\" to the cruel practice of bear farming. For the next seven years, Robinson researched the way bile was used and negotiated with the Chinese government. In 2000, the Sichuan Forestry Department signed a pledge with the China Wildlife Conservation Association to release 500 bears from the bile farms with the worst conditions. This marked the first time an agency of the Chinese government had come to an official agreement with an animal welfare organization.

Chamberlain described Holden as well-spoken, intelligent, and physically quite large. He also described Holden as perhaps the most ruthless of the roving band of killers led by Glanton.\n\nA fictionalized Holden is a central figure in Cormac McCarthy's novel \"Blood Meridian\". In the novel, he and Glanton are the leaders of a pack of nomadic criminals who rob, rape, torture, and kill across the borderlands between the United States and Mexico.

Finding verification of Holden's existence has been a hobby for some Cormac McCarthy scholars.\n\nIn 2002, \"Book\" magazine rated Holden, as appearing in \"Blood Meridian\", as the 43rd greatest character in fiction since 1900.\n\nAs depicted in \"Blood Meridian\", Holden is a mysterious figure, a cold-blooded killer and an implied pedophile; aside from the children he openly kills, he is seen enticing children with sweets, and a child often goes missing when he is in the vicinity. Further, at one point in the novel he is seen with a naked 12-year-old girl in his room. Holden displays a preternatural breadth of knowledge and skills—paleontology, archaeology, linguistics, law, technical drawing, geology, chemistry, prestidigitation, and philosophy, to name a few.\n\nHe is described as seven feet tall and completely bereft of body hair, including no eyebrows or eyelashes. He is massive in frame, enormously strong, an excellent musician and dancer, a fine draftsman, exceptionally articulate and persuasive in several languages, and an unerring marksman. His skin is so pale as to have almost no pigment. This strange appearance, as well as his keen, extremely fast reflexes, strength, agility, apparent immunity to sleep and aging, and multifarious other abilities point to his being something other than a normal human being.\n\nIn the final pages of the novel, McCarthy makes more direct reference to the Judge as a supernatural entity, or even as a concept, personified.\n\nIn his essay \"Gravers False and True: Blood Meridian as Gnostic Tragedy\", literature professor Leo Daugherty argued that McCarthy's Holden is—or at least embodies—a gnostic archon, a kind of demon. Harold Bloom, who declared McCarthy's Holden to be \"the most frightening figure in all of American literature\", has even come to regard The Judge as immortal. However, unlike Daugherty, Bloom argues that The Judge defies identification as any being under any \"system\" such as Gnosticism, citing the passage in the book stating that there was no \"system by which to divide [The Judge] back into his origins\". Rather, Bloom \"resort[s]\" to literary comparison with Shakespeare's Iago, a methodical dispenser of strife.\n"}

They consider their ancestors to be the Medes which adopted the Zoroastrian religion. In this religion there is equality between women and men, promoting the equal participation between them in making decisions and also supporting women who can fully exercise their rights. The history of Medes has shown that women fought in the battle beside their men but a few female leaders were mentioned in the history such as Zrena.\n\nZrena was the first woman who led the army of the Median Empire. She was the daughter of one of the most important Pir, Shailar. She studied Philosophy and Geometry and practiced with her bow and arrow. She was much more like her father in thinking and fighting. She followed in her father’s footsteps and became a Mariya. After her father's death, she led the army successfully with the rest of the Mariyas. Her words encouraged the warriors (Sarbaz) in the war, one of the important quotes remaining until this generation to Sarbaz is \"If the light shines behind me I could face the darkness even the light comes from a small candle\". She never turned around while she was at the battle to know whether the rest of the army was with her or not. She asked Piran Congress to burn the left breast of the girls in their earlier age while she noticed that the Mariyas were struggling with their bow and arrow, but Piran Congress refused her request because they considered that as an anti-humanitarian act, although they knew from Magi’s prediction that the Median Empire would collapse one day.\n\nThe following of her quote were recorded in the manuscript which advised warriors:\nIn what do you fear! You are part of the nature whether you alive or die.<br>\nDo not let your feet to be proud while your sword defeated the enemies.<br>\nDo not fight for your personal benefit as sunlight gave your life.\nThe second woman in Kurdish history is well known and called Mir Xanzad. She was a sister of Mir Suliman who was a prince of Soran Emirate. After he was assassinated by Lashkri, who was one of the higher commander in the military, in 1590, Xanzad took over the reins of power and became princess of Soran Emirate. Lashkri with his army could not face Mir Xanzad and for that reason he went to Shangal. However, both armies could not face and attack their base. Mir Xanzad wrote a letter to him and stated that she could not manage the governor and take all the heritage of Soran Emirate should someone share power with her. She stated also that she could not find someone better than him to marry. When Lashkri received the letter he went to Harir with 100 knights. On the next day, he was handcuffed with his knights and executed.\n\nMir Xanzad ruled Soran Emirate for seven years and had an active role by building castles and roads and also reinforced the army. One of the most beautiful castles was known by her name. Xanzad Castle, located about 20 km north of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region.\n\nThe third woman in Kurdish history was called Hapsa Xani-Naqib. She was a cousin of King Mahmmud. She was born in 1891 in Sulimani. She became a politician woman by participating in many activities in the Kurdish revolution and had a role in gaining women's rights. She wrote a letter to the United Nations and asked for Kurdish rights when the Kurds were about to be squeezed by four countries; Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. She supported the Kurdish revolution financially and physically during her life as we could see she supported Qazi Mahammad when established the Republic of Kurdistan on 22 January 1946. She was a great women who died in 12/04/1953 while she had many projects on her mind to serve her nation.\n\nFata resh has commanded Kurdish tribal-units in the Ottoman–Russian wars against Russian Empire to protect the Caucasian front and the Crymea front.\n\nThe role of Kurdish women in the battle is highlighted from the past to the present as we can see 1960th Leyla Qasim and Margret were participating in the Kurdish revolution to the South of Kurdistan against the Iraqi regime.\n\nFrom 1978, Kurdish women have been involved in original history. As we can see on a daily basis, many women to the (soils of Turkish Republic) are struggling beside men against the Turkish regime in order to get freedom for the Emperialist Forces. In the last decade, many Kurdish women played a huge role and led PKK militants, without any fear and gave their soul for their militant, human slayer unity Pınarcık Katliamı which opposing civilians including 16 children in Pınarcık province and country, such as Zilan, Shilan, Beritan and Vian.\n\nGülnaz Karataş (Bêrîtan), also known as Beritan. She studied the science of Economics and English. She joined PKK with her fiancé in 1989. Later on, she was arrested by Turkish authorities. After she was released, she went to Guti Mountain to join the PKK army. In 1992 when the fighting started between PDK and PKK, she threw herself over a cliff when her ammunition ran out.\n\nLaila Wali, also known as Vian Jaff, was born in Sulimani in 1981. She studied primary and secondary school in Sulimani and left school in order to join PKK to get women’s rights. She believed the only way to get freedom for humanity and specifically Kurdish rights was through PKK. Soon, she started her education through PKK and became one of the active women in that movement. Later on, she became a member of PCDK. She worked in PCDK's media and started to write about Kurdish women. On the fourth conference of PCDK, she became a member of PJA(The party of Freedom Women). On 2 February 2006, she burnt herself for freedom and gave the message to the world that \"There is no life without Ocalan\". She gave her soul, body, courage, bravery, words, pens, papers, etc., to Kurdish women.\n\nThe Role of Avesta in Median Empire/Véjeye Avéstaíya lenau Xaka Madaíya/ ڤێژه‌یا ئاڤێستایا له‌ناو خاکا مادایا It is a manuscript of one of the most important manuscript bundles which existed until the British invasion of Iraq after the First World War. This manuscript was of interest by British archaeologies because the history of the Iranian empire of the Medes and Persians were recorded and was passed down through the generations. This manuscript is likely uncovered by Zoroastrian families with the rest of the manuscript bundles and some pictures were taken by a Kurdish historian in 2005 before they disappeared again. Here are some pictures:\n\n"}

He was born the 16th of August 1959 in Tilburg, Netherlands and has lived in Amsterdam since 1982. He received highest honours for international documentaries at the \"Sundance Festival\" and was the first two-time International Documentary winner at the \"International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam (IDFA)\".. In June 5, 2018 he was rewarded by the Dutch King Willem-Alexander with the title Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion, a very high distinction.\n\nHelmrich is famous for perfecting the 'Single Shot Cinema' filming method and his related technical camera innovations.\n\"...you can move inside an event and go with your camera to the right spot, at the right moment... That’s what the whole single-shot cinema is about: trying to think of the world as a kind of clockwork, a machinery, with everything interrelated. The bigger and smaller things are just as important. In a clockworks you can’t pull out a little gear because the whole thing jams. The solution is to become one of the clockworks.\", Leonard Retel Helmrich.\n\nAfter Indonesian independence the Helmrich family repatriated to the Netherlands during the Indo diaspora. His father, Jean Retel Helmrich, was born to a wealthy \"totok\" family in Semarang, Dutch East Indies, fought against the Japanese invaders during World War II and was interred as a POW for three years. After the war he married a Javanese woman. “It was forbidden,” Mr. Helmrich’s sister and producer, Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich, explained. “They had to get permission from the Queen, from the Indonesian government, the Dutch government, the Muslim church, and the Catholic Church. It was Romeo and Juliet.” Growing up, the filmmaker “had a lot of problems because of his dyslexia,” she said. “The teachers were always complaining that he was living in his own world, but already when he was a little boy he made very good drawings.” The family’s belief in him extended to financing “Eye of the Day” and getting involved in other ways. Ms. Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich’s production company, Scarabee, produces Mr. Helmrich’s films; her son, Jasper Naaijkens, is his uncle’s editor — which cannot be any easy job, considering Mr. Helmrich can come up with hourlong shots.\n\nLeonard Retel Helmrich graduated from the Dutch Film and Television Academy in 1986 and in 1990 he made his first feature film, The Phoenix Mystery. His first documentary, Moving Objects (1991) was awarded the Special Jury Price for the Best Artist-Profile at the International Golden Gate Film Festival of San Francisco. Retel Helmrich developed his own cinematic style based on a principle which he has developed and calls \"Single Shot Cinema\". After finishing the film Moving Objects, he decided to travel to Indonesia where his parents were born, with the idea to show people around the world what was happening in this beautiful and very complicated country. He discovered that the authority of President Suharto was declining. In 1995 he made a film about Suharto and his wife in their Jakartan palace. He then went to Solo in central Java to film a demonstration against the Suharto regime. During his activities he was arrested by the police and accused of being a Western spy. With the help of the Dutch Embassy and his brother Anton, who happened to be in Indonesia, he was released after a few days. However, he was expelled from the country with the status \"persona non grata\" meaning he would no longer be allowed to visit Indonesia.\nLeonard Retel Helmrich traveled to Kansas City, Missouri to work with the Institute of Art in developing the principles of Single Shot Cinema.\nIn 1997 his brother succeeded to convince the Indonesian government to change his \"persona non grata\" status and Leonard Retel Helmrich was allowed to return to finish his work. Unfortunately a lot of material had been destroyed or was unusable. He decided to change his strategy. Many journalists were reporting the fall of Suharto and Retel Helmrich wanted to focus on the micro-aspects of the changes by following an Indonesian family in one of Jakarta's slums. All the changes in politics, religion, islamization, poverty, social injustice, globalization, criminality, corruption, etc. affected every Indonesian in his daily life. Thus he came up with the idea to film a triptych about the struggle for survival of a family in those trying days in Indonesia. In 2001 he finished Eye of the Day (Stand van de Zon) and in 2004 he made Shape of the Moon (Stand van de Maan) which became a worldwide success.\n\nSince then Retel Helmrich’s films have screened and won acclaim at film festivals worldwide, garnering major awards for both his drama and documentary work. His awards include the inaugural World Cinema Jury Prize Documentary at Sundance 2005 and the prestigious Joris Ivens Award at IDFA Amsterdam 2004 for his Indonesian feature documentary Shape of the Moon (Stand van de Maan). In 2010 he won for the second time the Grand VPRO/IDFA Award for feature documentary for \"Position Among the Stars\" (Stand van de Sterren) together with the IDFA Award for the best Dutch documentary. It was the first time in the IDFA history that a director won this award for the second time. In January 2011 he won again at Sundance where he received the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Prize for \"Position among the Stars\".\n\nLeonard Retel Helmrich has served on the jury of many film festivals, including festivals in Shanghai, Warsaw, Seoul, Sibiu (Romania) and Amsterdam. He has had major retrospectives of his work at Visions du Réel in Nyon, Switzerland, Rencontres Internationales du Documentaire in Montreal and at ASTRA in Sibiu, Romania. He has also lectured and screened his films at numerous educational institutions including the Flaherty Seminar Program in New York and at Harvard University where he was awarded a Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies. Leonard shoots as well as directs all his own films and is best known for a philosophy and approach he calls ‘Single Shot Cinema’, which involves long takes with a hand-held but smooth camera moving close to the subject. Above all, in his films, it is the framing and movement of the camera that captures and leads the emotions of the audience. He has taught numerous workshops on Single Shot Cinema techniques for film festivals, television broadcasters, independent filmmakers, film schools and universities in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia and in Africa. During his Harvard fellowship, he was editing his latest film Position Among the Stars, the third film of his trilogy on contemporary Indonesia. He is currently writing a book about “Single Shot Cinema”.\n\nSingle Shot Cinema is a way of filming that enables one to shoot a scene in one single take using just one camera moving fluidly around the subject recording all the camera angles that express one's personal feeling and perception of that moment. The camera moves steadily and fluidly while constantly changing angles. The idea is to use fast and slow, high and low, close and far camera movements in a single shot within a scene. In this way, the camera movement itself becomes the primary cinematic expression.\n\n\"In “Shape of the Moon” (2004) a barefoot man crosses a railroad trestle a thousand feet above an Indonesian valley, stepping briskly along a beam barely wider than his feet. We see him from behind. We see him from above. Most alarming, we see him from the side, by means of a camera that seems mounted in midair. It’s breathtaking, what the subject is doing. But a man with a camera is doing it too.\" John Anderson, The New York Times.\n\nHe was inspired by the French film critic André Bazin whose ideas helped create the Nouvelle Vague films of Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. According to Bazin, a moving camera is the essence of filmmaking: “It should not cut up reality, but rather it should show reality in its temporal continuity.” Single Shot Cinema in documentary means catching real life moments while they are happening in one continuous shot with a camera that is moving around the subject. As a result, shots are not edited from one still moment to the next, but rather from one camera movement to the next. In practice this means that the camera movement must have a dramatic purpose. Ideally all footage shot should be usable for editing. In order to accomplish this, the filmmaker should always keep the center of attention within the camera frame.\nBazin goes on to say that the camera must be equally prepared to move as to remain still. He describes camera movement in Italian Neorealism as having a human quality, as a projection of the hand and the eye, almost like a living part of the operator flowing directly from his awareness.\n\n\"“His camera glides through spaces in a way that just seems impossible... Sometimes you stop looking at the movie and look at the shot. But I think it’s delightful.\"\" Robb Moss, film lecturer at Harvard.\n\n\n"}

That is their reason for \"being\". They made their goal to attain 'swarga'. Conventionally, the term is applied to beings with a high degree of enlightenment. Bodhisattva literally means a \"bodhi (enlightenment) being\" in Sanskrit. Mahayana practitioners have historically lived in many other countries that are now predominantly Hindu, Muslim or Theravada Buddhist; remnants of reverence for bodhisattvas has continued in some of these regions.\n\nThe following is a partial list of bodhisattvas primarily respected in Indian, Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.\n\n\n, ) is a bodhisattva who is associated with the great element (\"mahābhūta\") of space (\"ākāśa\").\n\n\nThe bodhisattva of compassion, the listener of the world's cries who uses skillful means to come to their aid; the most universally acknowledged bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism and appears unofficially in Theravada Buddhism in Cambodia under the name Lokeśvara. This bodhisattva gradually became identified predominantly as female in East Asian Buddhism and its name may originally have been Avalokitāśvara.\n\n\nKṣitigarbha is a bodhisattva primarily revered in East Asian Buddhism and usually depicted as a Buddhist monk. His name may be translated as \"Earth Treasury\", \"Earth Store\", \"Earth Matrix\", or \"Earth Womb\". Kṣitigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds between the death of Gautama Buddha and the rise of Maitreya, as well as his vow not to achieve Buddhahood until all hells are emptied. He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture.\n\n\nMahāsthāmaprāpta (Korean: Daeseji) is a mahāsattva representing the power of wisdom, often depicted in a trinity with Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara, especially in Pure Land Buddhism. His name literally means \"arrival of the great strength\".\n\n\nIn some Buddhist texts such as the \"Amitabha Sutra\" and the \"Lotus Sutra\", he is referred to as Ajita.\n\nAccording to both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, Maitreya is regarded as the future buddha. Buddhist tradition, Maitreya is a bodhisattva who will appear on Earth in the future, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure \"dharma\". According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor to the present Buddha, Gautama Buddha. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya refers to a time in the future when the dharma will have been forgotten by most on the terrestrial world. This prophecy is found in the canonical literature of all major schools of Buddhism. Maitreya has also been adopted for his millenarian role by many non-Buddhist religions in the past such as the White Lotus as well as by modern new religious movements such as Yiguandao.\n\n\nMañjuśrī is a bodhisattva associated with prajñā (transcendent wisdom) in Mahayana Buddhism. In Tibetan Buddhism, he is also a yidam. His name means \"Gentle Glory\". Mañjuśrī is also known by the fuller Sanskrit name of Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, literally \"Mañjuśrī, Still a Youth\" or, less literally, \"Prince Mañjuśrī\".\n\n\nThe are two wrath-filled and muscular guardians of the Buddha standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples in East Asian Buddhism in the form of frightening wrestler-like statues. They are dharmapala manifestations of the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi. According to Japanese tradition, they travelled with Gautama Buddha to protect him and there are references to this in the Pāli Canon as well as the \"Ambaṭṭha Sutta\". Within the generally pacifist tradition of Buddhism, stories of dharmapalas justified the use of physical force to protect cherished values and beliefs against evil. The Niō are also seen as a manifestation of Mahasthamaprapta in Pure Land Buddhism and as Vajrasattva in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\nPadmasambhāva \"Lotus-Born\", also known as Guru Rinpoche, is a literary character of terma, an emanation of Amitābha that is said to appear to tertöns in visionary encounters and a focus of Tibetan Buddhist practice, particularly in the Nyingma school.\n\n\nSamantabhadra \"Universal Worthy\" is associated with practice and meditation. Together with the Buddha and Mañjuśrī, he forms the \"Shakyamuni trinity\" in Buddhism. He is the patron of the \"Lotus Sutra\" and, according to the \"Avatamsaka Sutra\", made the ten great vows which are the basis of a bodhisattva. In China, Samantabhadra is associated with action, whereas Mañjuśrī is associated with prajñā. In Japan, Samantabharda is often venerated by the Tendai and in Shingon Buddhism, and as the protector of the \"Lotus Sutra\" by Nichiren Buddhism. In the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, Samantabhadra is also the name of the Adi-Buddha - in indivisible Yab-Yum union with his consort, Samantabhadrī.\n\n\nOnly revered in Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sangharama refer to a group of devas who guard viharas and the faith, but the title is usually referring to the legendary Chinese military general Guan Yu, who became a dharmapala through becoming a Buddhist and making vows.\n\n\nSitātapatrā \"the White Parasol\" is a protector against supernatural danger. She is venerated in both Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions. She is also known as \"Uṣṇīṣa Sitatapatra\". Sitātapatrā is a powerful independent deity as she was emanated by Gautama Buddha from his uṣṇīṣa. Whoever practices her mantra will be reborn in Amitābha's pure land as well as gaining protection against supernatural danger and black magic.\n\nSkanda is regarded as a devoted guardian of viharas and the Buddhist teachings. He is the leader of the twenty-four celestial guardian deities mentioned in the \"Golden Light Sutra\". In Chinese temples, Skanda faces the statue of the Buddha in the main shrine. In others, he is on the far right of the main shrine, whereas on the left is his counterpart, Sangharama, personified as the historical general Guan Yu. In Chinese sutras, his image is found at the end of the sutra, a reminder of his vow to protect and preserve the teachings.\n\nMentioned in Shantideva's \"Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra\".\n\n(Ch: 日光, \"Riguang\", Kr. \"Il Guang\", Jp: \"Nikkō\") One of two attendants of Bhaisajyaguru.\n\n(Ch. 度母, \"Du Mu\") Female bodhisattva, or set of bodhisattvas, in Tibetan Buddhism. She represents the virtues of success in work and achievements. Also a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara.\n\n\nVajrapani is extensively represented in Buddhist iconography as one of the three protective deities surrounding the Buddha. Each of them symbolizes one of the Buddha's virtues: Mañjuśrī manifests all the Buddhas' wisdom, Avalokiteśvara manifests all the Buddhas' compassion and Vajrapāṇi manifests all the Buddhas' power as well as the power of all five tathāgatas. Vajrapāṇi is one of the earliest dharmapalas and the only Buddhist deity to be mentioned in the Pāli Canon as well as be worshiped in the Shaolin Monastery, in Tibetan Buddhism and in Pure Land Buddhism, where he is known as Mahasthamaprapta and forms a triad with Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara. Manifestations of Vajrapāṇi can also be found in many Buddhist temples in Japan as dharma protectors called the Niō or \"Two Kings\". Vajrapani is also associated with Acala, who is venerated as \"Fudo-Myō\" in Japan, where he is serenaded as the holder of the vajra.\n\n\nVasudhārā whose name means \"stream of gems\" in Sanskrit, is the bodhisattva of wealth, prosperity, and abundance. She is popular in many Buddhist countries and is a subject in Buddhist legends and art. Originally an Indian bodhisattva, her popularity has spread to Theravadin countries. Her popularity, however, peaks in Nepal, where she has a strong following among the Buddhist Newars of the Kathmandu Valley and is thus a central figure in Newar Buddhism. She is named Shiskar Apa in Lahul and Spiti.\n"}

Among these was the prestigious Fabrique Electa, which became the upscale line of the jewelry department at Macy’s Department store in New York City during the first quarter of the 20th century. Léon L. Gallet also established the brands National Park, Continental Watch Company, Jerome Park, Bridgeport, Eureka, Commodore, Union Square, and Lady Racine. While the appearance and function of many of Gallet’s timepieces were tailored to the tastes of the American consumers, all of the movements in these watches were manufactured in Switzerland.\n\nLéon Gallet played a philanthropic role in the business, cultural, and social life of his native home. As well as his prominent position as a member of both the legislature of Neuchâtel and the Council of La Chaux-de-Fonds, he was for many years, the president of the Société des Amis des Arts (Fine Arts Society) and Grand Master of the Free Masons. Together with Louis & Jules Courvoisier, Ernest Francillon of Longines, and Constant Girard-Perregaux, Léon Gallet founded the Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society for the Industries of the Jura Area) in 1876. The purpose of this organization was to assist in the promotion and distribution of products from Switzerland's Watch Valley while addressing the growing threat of competition in European markets from American watch manufacturers.\n\nUpon his death in 1899, Léon Gallet bequeathed a sum of 43,000 Swiss Francs (today equivalent to 1,000,000 Swiss Francs or approx. 1,000,000 US dollars) to his hometown of La Chaux-de-Fonds, of which 25,000 Swiss Francs were earmarked to build the Musée International d'Horlogerie (International Watch Making Museum). Donated by Léon Gallet’s son Georges, the museum’s collection was started with a body of over 100 of Gallet's most complicated and valuable timepieces, including the world's first wristwatch produced for mass consumption in 1892. The balance of the bequeathed funds was used to construct the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds), designed by renowned painter Charles l’Eplattenier and architect René Chapallaz, Le Corbusier's architecture teacher.\n\nPrior to his passing, Léon Gallet commissioned René Chapallaz, to design \"Villa Gallet\". Situated in \"Parc Gallet\" in the southern part of La Chaux-de-Fonds, \"Villa Gallet\" still retains its original name and is considered as an important historic contribution to the Swiss Art Nouveau movement of the late 19th century.\n\nAny study of the 19th century industrialization of Switzerland’s “Watch Valley” is not complete without mentioning the role of watchmaker and entrepreneur, Léon L. Gallet.\n\nIn the years following America’s Civil War, a powerful shift of that country’s concentration moved from agriculture to industry. With this shift came great advancements in manufacturing as centrally located factories replaced small workshops, and large scale production of items with interchangeable parts quickly displaced less efficient hand-crafting. An immediate beneficiary of this progress was America’s watch and clock industry, as northern coal powered factories began turning out hundreds of high quality timepieces per day. On the horizon for these newly empowered companies was the inevitable expansion beyond domestic borders to embark in direct competition with the Swiss watchmaking industry.\n\nLéon L. Gallet and Ernest Francillon of Longines, two Swiss watchmakers who were actively selling their wares in North America, saw the writing on the wall. Recognizing the only way that the small workshops of Switzerland’s “Watch Valley” could compete against the growing threat posed by larger American manufacturers was to unite. At the prompting of Gallet and Francillon, a new organization was created. The Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries) was formed to bring together the individual strengths of the region’s numerous independent watchmaking houses as a powerful cooperative entity.\n\nYet, in spite of the formation of this new organization, the warnings of Gallet and Francillon were met with skepticism by the other members of the group. Decades of success as the world’s primary supplier of fine timepieces had resulted in a self-assured complacency within Switzerland’s watchmaking industry.\n\nThen on the 10th of May, 1876, the great Philadelphia International Exhibition, created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of America’s Declaration of Independence, opened to the public. Among the many displays was the indisputable evidence of the manufacturing superiority of such American companies as Waltham and Elgin, each capable of finishing many hundred watches per day.\n\nJacques David, Swiss watchmaker and machine designer, was dispatched to America by Ernest Francillon to witness the exhibitions first-hand, and report his findings back to the Intercanonal Society. Léon L. Gallet followed shortly behind, arriving in Philadelphia the next month. What both men witnessed at the exhibition further confirmed the concerns of Gallet and Francillon.\n\nOn his return to Switzerland in November, Jacques David wrote a long detailed report on the mens' findings to the Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries. While David’s report helped to wake the Swiss watchmaking industry from its comfortable complacency, increased revenues were needed for the Society’s members to initiate the developments required to meet these new challenges.\n\nBy the time that the Philadelphia Exposition opened to the public in 1876, Léon L. Gallet had already established sales offices in both New York City and Chicago, going back over ten years. He had personally suffered a number of long ocean voyages to deliver his wares and to conduct business. Besides his acute knowledge of the growing threat posed by worldwide competition from US manufactures, Gallet understood the tastes of the American consumer and the opportunities the new world also held for the Jura watchmakers.\n\nWith the now available joint resources from fellow manufacturing members of the Intercantonal Society, Gallet decided to take the competitive battle directly to the enemy. Not only could the rapidly expanding base of American consumers provide opportunities for increased sales of Swiss watches, these sales could provide the needed revenues to meet the expected competitive challenges in Europe.\n\nUtilizing his own movements, as well as components by such friends as Auguste Agassiz, Ernest Francillon, Constant Girard-Perregaux, Jules Jeanneret, and Louis and Jules Courvoisier, Gallet began production of 30 new watch brands, most designed specifically to appeal to the taste of the America consumer.\n\nWithin a short period, exports of Swiss watches to America rapidly increased, greatly expanding the reach of watchmakers whose previous market was limited only to the local economies. As a result, Leon L. Gallet’s American marketing activities helped to provide the needed capital for the watchmakers of the Jura region to industrialize, and successfully meet one of the greatest challenges in Swiss timekeeping’s history.\n\n"}

He shared the prize with Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies. He is currently Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics and Biology at the University of Utah School of Medicine.\n\nMario Capecchi was born in Verona, Italy, as the only child of Luciano Capecchi, an Italian airman who would be later reported as missing in action while manning an anti-aircraft gun in the Western Desert Campaign, and Lucy Ramberg, an American-born daughter of Impressionist painter Lucy Dodd Ramberg and German archaeologist Walter Ramberg. During World War II, his mother was sent to the Dachau concentration camp as punishment for pamphleteering and belonging to an anti-Fascist group. Prior to her arrest she had made contingency plans by selling her belongings and giving the proceeds to a peasant family near Bolzano to provide housing for her only child. However, after one year, the money was exhausted and the family was unable to care for him. At four-and-a-half years old he was left to fend for himself, living as a street child on the streets of northern Italy for the next four years, living in various orphanages and roving through towns with groups of other homeless children.\n\nHe almost died of malnutrition. His mother, meanwhile, had been freed from Dachau and began a year-long search for him. She finally found him in a hospital bed in Reggio Emilia, ill with a fever and subsisting on a daily bowl of chicory coffee and bread crust. She took him to Rome, where he had his first bath in six years.\n\nIn 1946 his uncle, Edward Ramberg, an American physicist at RCA, sent his sister money to return to the United States. He and his mother moved to Pennsylvania to live at an \"intentionally cooperative community\" called Bryn Gweled, which had been co-founded by his uncle. (Capecchi's other maternal uncle, Walter Ramberg, was also an American physicist who served as the tenth president of the Society for Experimental Stress Analysis.) He graduated from George School, a Quaker boarding school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in 1956.\n\nMario Capecchi received his Bachelor of Science in chemistry and physics in 1961 from Antioch College in Ohio. Capecchi came to MIT as a graduate student intending to study physics and mathematics, but during the course of his studies, he became interested in molecular biology. He subsequently transferred to Harvard to join the lab of James D. Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA. Capecchi received his Ph.D. in biophysics in 1967 from Harvard University, with his doctoral thesis completed under the tutelage of Watson.\n\nCapecchi was a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University from 1967 to 1969. In 1969 he became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Harvard Medical School. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971. In 1973 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah. Since 1988 Capecchi has also been an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He has given a talk for Duke University's Program in Genetics and Genomics as part of their Distinguished Lecturer Series. He was the speaker for the 2010 Racker Lectures in Biology & Medicine and Cornell Distinguished Lecture in Cell and Molecular Biology at Cornell University.\n\nAfter the Nobel committee publicly announced that Capecchi had won the Nobel prize, an Austrian woman named Marlene Bonelli claimed that Capecchi was her long-lost half-brother.\nIn May 2008, Capecchi met with Bonelli, 69, in northern Italy, and confirmed that she was his sister.\n\nCapecchi won the Nobel prize for creating a knockout mouse. This is a mouse, created by genetic engineering and in vitro fertilization, in which a particular gene has been turned off. For this work, Capecchi won the 2007 Nobel prize for medicine or physiology, along with Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies, who also contributed.\n\nCapecchi has also pursued a systematic analysis of the mouse Hox gene family. This gene family plays a key role in the control of embryonic development in all multicellular animals. They determine the placement of cellular development in the proper order along the axis of the body from head to toe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15515838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15515838", "title": "Okinawan name", "text": "Okinawan name\n\nOkinawan names today have only two components, the family names (surnames or last names) first and the given names last. Okinawan family names represent the distinct historical and cultural background of the islands which now comprise Okinawa Prefecture in Japan. Expatriates originally from Okinawa also have these names.\n\nAs Japanese citizens, Okinawans today comply with the Japanese family register (\"koseki\") system. Accordingly, an Okinawan name has only two components, a family name and a given name. A family name is called \"myōji\" (苗字 or 名字), \"uji\" (氏) or \"sei\" (姓), and a given name is called the \"front name\" (名前, \"namae\") or \"lower name\" (下の名前, \"shita no namae\"). The family name precedes the given name. The given name may be referred to as the \"lower name\" because, in vertically-written Japanese, the given name appears under the family name.\n\nJapanese family names generally show regional variation, but Okinawan family names are known for its distinctiveness. In contrast it becomes increasingly difficult to find unique Okinawan given names.\n\nThis top 10 list is based on the name as written in kanji (Chinese characters). Since the Japanese language allows for multiple possible \"readings (pronunciations)\" for each character, the reading of Okinawan family names written with the same characters varies. In addition, the Okinawan language has its own means of reading Japanese kanji.\n\nAs in mainland Japan, historical names in Okinawa are more complicated. People with different social statuses bore different kinds of names, maintained several names to use in different occasions, and sometimes changed them in their lifetime. Okinawan names underwent great changes after the Ryūkyū Kingdom fell under the Satsuma Domain's control.\n\n\"Warabi-naa\" (warabe-na/\"warabi-naa\", 童名) were personal names. For example, the \"warabi-naa\" of Tamagusuku Chōkun was Umi-guraa (思五良). \"Warabi-naa\" were most prevalent among Okinawans, from the king to commoners, both male and female. They were the oldest component of Okinawan names as, like people in mainland Japan, the inhabitants of Ryukyu islands did not originally have names for families, clans or lineages. They were used as the official names during the early era of the Ryukyu Kingdom. They appeared even in appointment letters by the king, written mostly in hiragana. It was during the 17th century that other name components prevailed among the pechin class.\n\nA \"warabi-naa\" was given soon after birth. Although literally meaning \"childhood name\", it was used by commoners for their entire life. While it was overshadowed by other name components, even adult male members of the pechin class used \"warabi-naa\" at home and when referring to their friends.\n\nLater in history, stylized use of prefixes and suffixes differentiated social statuses. A commoner used neither a prefix nor suffix, a samurai used either a prefix or suffix, and an aristocrat used both a prefix and a suffix. For example, Tukū (徳) was a name for commoners, Umi-tukū (思徳) for samurai, and Umi-tuku-gani (思徳金) for aristocrats.\n\nA set of \"warabi-naa\" appeared in the very beginning of recorded history and has not been changed since then. The number of \"warabi-naa\" pooled in society was extremely small. It was not uncommon for a \"warabi-naa\" to be shared by more than one person in a household. The first male child was usually named after his paternal grandfather. For example, the last king Shō Tai had the \"warabi-naa\" Umi-jiraa-gani (思次良金), which was also the name of his grandfather Shō Kō.\n\nEven in the Old Ryukyu era, social development led Okinawans to acquire names other than \"warabi-naa\" for disambiguation. \"Kamei\" (家名) or \"Yaa-n-naa\" (家の名), both meaning \"family name,\" were often attached to \"warabi-naa\". \"Kamei\" were toponyms, either the domains they ruled or the places of their origin. For example, an inscription of the Old Ryukyu era contains a personal name, \"Mafuto-kane    Ufusato no Ufu-yakumoi\" (まふとかね 大さとの大やくもい), where \"Mafuto-kane\" (Mafutu-gani) was a \"warabi-naa\", \"Ufusato\" (Ufusatu) was a place associated with him, and \"Ufu-yakumoi\" (Ufu-yakumui) was the title he was given.\n\nIn the naming conventions after the separation of the Peichin class from peasants, only the Pechin class was allowed to have \"kamei\". Because the vast majority of the Pechin families lacked domains to rule, they inherited fixed \"kamei\". In contrast, an upper class member used the name of the fief he was given by the king. This means that his \"kamei\" was changed every time a different land was allotted. For example, Makishi Chōchū (1818–1862) originally had the \"kamei\" Itarashiki (板良敷) but was then given a fief of Ōwan (大湾) before being finally renamed to Makishi (牧志).\n\nIn early times, \"kamei\" were written predominantly in hiragana. After the invasion of the Ryūkyū Kingdom by Japan's Satsuma Domain in 1609, the Japanese-style use of Chinese characters (kanji) was adopted. The Keichō Land Surveys of 1609-1611 probably conventionalized to some degree the choice of kanji for place names, and thus surnames based on them. In 1625 the Satsuma Domain instituted a . As a result, the kanji used to write \"kamei\" changed from characters that were common in Japan to new, unique character combinations. For example, the name 東 (Higashi) was often changed to 比嘉 (Figa) or 比謝 (Fija), the name 前田 (Maeda) to 真栄田 (the same reading), 福山 (Fukuyama) to 譜久山 (the same reading), etc.\n\nIn practice, \"kamei\" represented a group who shared the founder of a relatively recent past. When it was necessary to distinguish branch families, the main family attached the prefix \"ufu\" (大, great) to its \"kamei\" while the suffix \"gwa\" (少, small), for example, was used for a branch family.\n\nOfficially, commoners did not have \"kamei\". At some point in history, commoners in the capital region, Shuri and Naha, started to assume \"kamei\". However, \"kamei\" of commoners were differentiated verbally and in writing. The last syllable of a commoner's \"kamei\" was lengthened (e.g. Arakachii) while that of a Pechin was not (e.g. Arakachi). For commoners, his \"warabi-naa\" is written first and is followed by his \"kamei\". For example, Taraa (\"warabi-naa\") from Yamagushiku was written as たら山城 (Taraa Yamagushiku).\n\nCommoners in rural areas unofficially used names for households, which were also called \"Yaa-n-naa\" (屋の名). They were similar to \"yagō\", private family names used by commoners in Japan.\n\nLike in Japan, a rank (位階) was also part of the addressing system. The following was the list of ranks after they were fixed:\nYoung male members of the Pechin class who had no rank were addressed with honorific suffixes: \"shii\" (子) for the upper class and \"nyaa\" (仁屋) for the lower class. Commoners had no rank.\n\nMale members of the Pechin class adopted \"nanui\" (nanori/\"nanui\", 名乗), or Japanese-style personal names, when they reached adulthood. Each \"nanui\" consists of two kanji characters, e.g. 朝薫 (Chōkun). The first character of a \"nanui\", called \"nanui-gasira\" (nanori-gashira/\"nanui-gasira\", 名乗頭), was shared by a lineage or \"munchū\". For example, the character 朝 (\"chō\") was used by branch families of the royal family including Chōkun (玉城朝薫), his father Chōchi (朝致) and his son Chōki (朝喜).\n\nThe direct reference to a \"nanui\" verbally and in writing was usually avoided because it was considered rude. In domestic documents, a Pechin was usually addressed by the combination of a \"kamei\" and a rank (e.g. Kyan Peekumi (喜屋武親雲上)). This was similar to the convention of Japan, e.g. Andō Tsushima-no-kami (安藤対馬守, Andō, Governor of Tsushima Province) for Andō Nobumasa. This combination can be found in as early as the first half of the 16th century. When necessary, a \"nanui\" was attached to the combination of a \"kamei\" and a rank. It is only a convention of historiography that people of the Ryūkyū Kingdom are referred to by the combination of a \"kamei\" and a \"nanui\", e.g. Tamagusuku Chōkun (玉城朝薫).\n\n\"Nanui\" came into use during the 17th century with obvious influence from Satsuma. The use of \"nanui-gashira\" is similar to that of \"tsūji\" (通字) in Japan. However, while \"tsūji\" was usually assumed only by the successor of a household, the first son in most cases, each \"nanui-gashira\" was shared by all the male member of a lineage.\n\nFrom 1689 male members of the Pechin class also had \"kara-naa\" (唐名) or Chinese names. Each \"kara-naa\" consists of a one-character name for a lineage called \"shii\" or \"uji\" (sei/\"shii\", 姓 or uji/\"uji\", 氏) and a personal name called \"imina\" (諱). For example, Tamagusuku Chōkun had the \"kara-naa\" Shō Juyū (向受祐). \"Kara-naa\" appeared neither officially nor privately in domestic affairs, but were used for diplomatic correspondence with Chinese dynasties. Thus a lower-class Pechin who had no post in the court had virtually no chance to use his \"kara-naa\".\n\nNames for Okinawan officials were recorded in early diplomatic documents written in Classical Chinese. They were actually corrupt forms of \"warabi-naa\" and \"kamei\". For example, \"a-fu-sat-to\" 阿布薩都 and \"ō-sat-to\" 王察度 both referred to the \"kamei\" Ufuzatu (大里). Similarly, \"go-ratsu\" 呉剌 and \"tatsu-ro-ka-ne\" 達魯加禰 derived from \"warabi-naa\" Guraa (五良) and Taru-gani (樽金) respectively. It is during the 16th century that some officials used names that could be analyzed as Chinese surnames and given names. It seems that at first these names were coined each time they were needed for a diplomatic trip to China. Some families from which diplomats came for generations began to succeed the first character of their ancestors' transcribed names as \"shii\". For instance, descendants of Mafutu-gani, who appeared as \"ma-botsu-to\" (麻勃都) in diplomatic records, adopted the \"shii\" Ma (麻) after him.\n\nThe development of Okinawan naming conventions was closely related with that of \"munchū\" (monchū/\"munchū\", 門中), or patrilineages. In 1689 \"Keizu-za\" or the Board of Genealogies (系図座) was established and all the Pechin lineages were ordered to compile genealogical records. In 1690 the royal court assigned one-character \"shii\" or Chinese surnames to all registered lineages. Since commoners were forbidden to compile genealogical records, this effectively separated the Pechin class from commoners. Genealogical records became a status symbol of the Pechin class. The Pechin class came to be referred to as \"keimochi\" (系持), lit. possessing genealogy, while commoners were called \"mukei\" (無系), lit. without genealogy.\n\nAmong the Pechin class, lineages were identified by the combination of the Chinese-style \"shii\" and the Japanese-style \"nanui-gashira\". A lineage with the \"shii\" Mō (毛) shared the \"nanui-gashira\" Sei (盛), but this \"nanui-gashira\" was also used by a lineage named Ō (翁). Also, there was another lineage whose \"shii\" was Mō, but its \"nanui-gashira\" was An (安). It should be noted that \"kamei\" cannot be a designator of lineages. The Mō lineage with the \"nanui-gashira\" Sei had was headed by the family with the \"kamei\" Tomigusuku (豊見城), but its branch families had various \"kamei\" including Kunigami (国頭) and Tomikawa (富川).\n\nThe title \"Ō\" (王) or king was of foreign origin. In Okinawan, the king styled himself \"anji-osoi-jyanashi\" or later \"Shui-tin-jyanashi\" (首里天加那志). The king was referred to as \"ushu-jyanashi-me\" by his people and as \"myuumee-jyanashi\" or \"nuumee-jyanshi\" by his family members.\n\nClose relatives of the king were given the ranks of \"wōji\" (王子) and \"anji\" (按司). Although \"wōji\" literally means the king's son, its conferrers were not limited to the king's son. A \"wōji\" or \"anji\" was referred to by his domain plus the suffix \"udun\" (御殿). The crown prince was traditionally given the domain Nakagusuku (中城) and therefore referred to as Nakagusuku-udun (中城御殿).\n\nMany early kings, up to Shō Hō, had divine names (神号) in addition to \"warabi-naa\". For example, Shō Gen's divine name was \"tida-hajimi-aji-sui\" (日始按司添). It seems that divine names were assumed after accession to the throne.\n\nThe king had a \"kara-naa\" and used it in diplomatic correspondence with China. The royal \"shii\" Shō (尚) was, according to Ryukyuan records, given to Shō Hashi by the Xuande Emperor of Ming China. This statement is highly questionable because no such record is found in Chinese documents and Shō Hashi used the \"shii\" even earlier. In 1692, the branch families of the royal house were given the \"shii\" Shō (向, note the different kanji) and the \"nanui-gashira\" Chō (朝) no matter how distant from the king.\n\nA district near the capital named Kumemura is said to have been founded by immigrants from Fujian, China. Its raison d'être was to manage diplomatic contacts with China although some were later engaged in domestic affairs. The members of the community had \"kara-naa\" or Chinese names from the very beginning. It is known that they also had \"warabi-naa\" as early as the first half of the 15th century.\n\nToday historical figures from Kumemura are often known by \"kara-naa\", e.g. Sai On. He appeared in domestic documents as Gushichan Uwekata after his \"kamei\" Gushichan (具志頭) and his rank Uwekata (親方). He had a \"nanui\" Bunjaku (文若), and therefore is sometimes known as Gushichan Bunjaku.\n\nThe Ryūkyū Kingdom was forced to become a Japanese feudal domain by the Meiji government in 1872, and it was formally annexed by Japan in 1879. Ryūkyūans were then entered into the Japanese family register (\"koseki\") system and, as in Japan, surnames were extended to all citizens, no longer being the province of the aristocratic classes alone. A large number of the names created at this time were taken from geographical names or places of residence. Direct descendants of Tamagusuku Chōkun, who by the time assumed the \"kamei\" Hentona (辺土名), adopted Hentona as their new surname.\n\nWhile the nobles had assumed new names when they reached adulthood, the new system forced them to adopt lifetime personal names soon after birth. At first, Japanese given names were often given when they entered school. For this reason, given names were informally called \"school names\" (学校名). \"Warabi-naa\" continued to be used unofficially until the early Shōwa period.\n\nWith increasing contacts with Japan, many Okinawans felt it inconvenient to use their alien-looking surnames. Since the law made it extremely difficult to change surnames, they often changed the \"reading\" of surnames while leaving their written forms unmodified. For example, Naagusuku (宮城) was usually changed to Miyagi (宮城). It is reported that, during the American military occupation after World War II, many managed to change their surname relatively easily. The family registers were completely destroyed by American attacks and reconstructed on individual declarations.\n\n\n"}

His father and his four older brothers were gunsmiths.\n\nTogether with his brother Wilhelm Mauser, Peter Paul Mauser designed the Mauser Model 1871 rifle, the first of a successful line of Mauser rifles and pistols. The rifle was adopted as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71 and was the first metal cartridge weapon of the German Empire. While Wilhelm handled this business side of the factory, Paul proved to be the more technically capable engineer.\n\nPeter Paul Mauser made significant contributions to bolt action rifle design and successfully combined and improved various bolt action engineering concepts. The Mauser company bolt action development resulted in the Gewehr 98 and Karabiner 98k rifle series that were the latest in a line of Mauser bolt action rifles that started with the Mauser Model 1889 and were adapted in 1889 and the 1890s as service rifles by several countries.

Worse still, Hopkins then filed a criminal libel suit against Shaw and Marven in the Rhode Island Courts.\n\nAppalled by the case, the Continental Congress then enacted a whistleblower protection law on July 30, 1778, by unanimous consent. The law declared it \"the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other inhabitants thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or any other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge.\"\n\nCongress then appropriated monies to represent and defend the Shaw and Marven against the libel suit filed against Hopkins, resolving that, \"reasonable expences [sic] of defending the said suit be defrayed by the United States,\" and Ordered terminated the employment of Hopkins, who \"had misconducted himself.\"\n\nOn the second National Whistleblower Appreciation Day, Shaw was recognized as an unsung hero of American Whistblowers.

During the rule of Prince Miloš Obrenović, Knićanin's political career began as a commissioner of the Jasenica municipality in 1835, and in 1839 as a commissioner of the Smederevo district, but he eventually joined the opposition as a Constitutionalist and supporter of the rival Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević of the Karađorđević dynasty. Since he supported \"ustavobranitelji\" (the defenders of the constitution), he was expelled from the Principality of Serbia in 1840-1841. He returned in 1842, after Aleksandar Karađorđević had acceded to the throne on September 14, after being elected the Prince of Serbia at the National Assembly in Vračar.\n\nDuring the 1848 Revolution, the Hungarians demanded national rights and autonomy within the Austrian Empire. However, they did not recognize the national rights of other nationalities which lived in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in that time.\n\nAs part of the Revolutions of 1848, the Serbs under Austria-Hungary demanded what they had in the previous century; recognition of Serbian as official language, equality of the Orthodox church as with Catholics, and annual church assembly gatherings. They met at Sremski Karlovci and Novi Sad. Several thousand Serbs met at the May Assembly in Sremski Karlovci on May 1, 1848. The delegates chose prominent Austrian-Serb general Stevan Šupljikac as \"voivode\", the civil and military commander (Duke). Josif Rajačić was elected the patriarch of the Serbs. The Serbs demanded a national unit consisting of Banat, Bačka, Baranja and part of Srem, known collectively as \"Vojvodina\". This was completely against the Hungarian authorities visions.\n\nFrom May 1848 onward, Serbs of Vojvodina directly sought aid from the Serbian Principality, and on May 10, general Stratimirović, head of the main committee, appealed to Prince Aleksandar for assistance and urged Knićanin to intercede. Knicanin was elected military commander. He had no prior experience in war, nor went to military school.\n\nIn June and July a large wave of volunteers from the Principality entered Vojvodina. Knićanin arrived on July 25. Among others who arrived were: the brother and nephew of Hajduk Veljko, council member Milutin Petrović, major Stanojlo Petrović, captain Sava Petrović and \"voivode\" prota Nenadović.\n\nFrom August 1848, Knićanin was a commander of the Serbian volunteer squads in the Serbian Vojvodina, in which unit also Golub Babić fought in. The size of his army exceeded 8,000 or 10,000 men. His military knowledge was expressed in more occasions, especially in the battles near Pančevo and Vršac during the 1848 Revolution in what was then the Austrian Empire.\n\nAfter his return to Serbia in May 1849, Knićanin was awarded with the title of voivode by Aleksandar Karađorđević, at that time it had only been given to Toma Vučić Perišić. He was a \"Knight of Maria Therese\", the highest order of the Austrian army.\n\nAs a result of a stroke in 1854, he died on May 14, 1855, in Belgrade.\n\nIn 1850, Louis Kossuth wrote: \"Bold Knicanin did wonders of bravery on the Lower Danube,\"\n\nThe village of Knićanin in the Serbian province of Vojvodina was named after him.\n\n"}

On September 13, 2017, it was announced that Pennington had signed on to join his former cast members for the reboot of \"Trading Spaces\", which is scheduled to air on TLC in 2018.\n\nPennington was born in Atlanta, Georgia as Gary Tygert Burton, the second son of school psychologist Yvonne Burton. Yvonne separated from Ty's father when he and his older brother Wynn were very young, and spent several years as a single parent before she remarried. Her new husband adopted both boys, giving them his surname Pennington. Ty is of partial Cherokee descent.\n\nA self-described \"Jack of all trades\", Pennington learned woodworking early in life and began teaching himself about carpentry and home improvement. After attending Sprayberry High School in Marietta, Georgia, he first attended Kennesaw State University, where he majored in art and history. He paid his way through college by taking night classes and working during the day, first working in landscaping before moving into construction. Despite his skills in carpentry, Pennington initially decided that carpentry wasn't something he wanted to do professionally, noting his main interests were in becoming an artist, specializing in Graphic Design. On the advice of one of his professors, he transferred to the Art Institute of Atlanta, from where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design.\n\nDuring his final semester, Pennington was approached by a modeling scout, and soon began a lucrative career in that field. He landed print jobs for J.Crew, Swatch and Sprite, and appeared in television spots for Diet Coke, Levi's, Macy's and Bayer, among others. His job as a model took him to places all over the world, as he went on to reside in Japan, Thailand, Italy, Canada, and Germany.\n\nPennington parlayed his hands-on skills and design acumen into a career in the entertainment industry, becoming a set designer, including for \"Leaving Las Vegas\" in 1995. However, his professional breakthrough came through The Learning Channel's (now known as simply TLC) innovative hit show \"Trading Spaces\". In 2003, he acted in the independent film, \"The Adventures of Ociee Nash\" (as \"Wilbur Wright\").\n\nIn 2003, when ABC began developing a show that would transform the homes of deserving families in seven days or less, Pennington was chosen as the leader of the eight-person design team. \"\", which was originally planned to be a 13-part special, became a huge hit, and catapulted Pennington to stardom. This led to an endorsement deal with Sears, a sponsor of the show. Pennington was extremely dedicated to the show, spending on average 240 days of the year working, and was known to have fought off anything from pulled muscles to heatstroke to food poisoning to keep doing his job. He stated that his career on the show resulted in the channel commissioning \"Ty's Great British Adventure\", in which he worked with communities including Portreath, Cornwall (UK) to restore a run-down town park in a week and Portishead, North Somerset (UK) to renovate the town's derelict outdoor pool into a community run Lido. The series was shown from September 16, 2008.\n\nWhen \"Extreme Makeover Home Edition\" ended in 2011 with its ninth season, Pennington had helped rebuild more than 200 homes for the show. Afterwards, Pennington relocated from Los Angeles to New York City, where he was cast to take part in the lifestyle-based talk show \"The Revolution\", which aired on ABC in January 2012. On one episode he appeared with Dr Edward Hallowell. Both men talked about ADHD and stimulant drugs. The show was cancelled after six months, after which Ty began pursuing other goals.\n\nPrior to his partnership with Sears, Pennington was the owner and designer of his company, Furniture Unlimited, which is based in Atlanta and Los Angeles. He also lends his name to Sears, with their design team guiding the design of every item in the Ty Pennington Style line of bedding, tabletop items, bath accessories, furniture, patio furniture, and other miscellaneous home decor.\n\nPennington published \"Ty's Tricks: Home Repair Secrets Plus Cheap and Easy Projects to Transform Any Room\" (2003), a do-it-yourself guide on home improvement. On May 15, 2007, he released the first issue of his quarterly magazine \"Ty Pennington at Home\", which ran until 2009. \n\nOn July 25, 2008, he announced a 3-year partnership with Marketplace Events, the largest organizer of consumer remodeling, home decor and gardening shows in North America.\n\nIn September 2008, Pennington became the spokesperson for Abbott Nutrition and their baby formula packaging innovation called \"Similac SimplePac\". He was also involved with the \"Similac Custom Nursery Design Contest\" and \"Ty's Nursery Guide\" that were part of the new product marketing.\n\nIn September 2011, Pennington was on one showing of Disney's \"Take Two With Phineas and Ferb\". On October 3, 2011, it was announced that Pennington was to join the upcoming series \"The Revolution\". The show premiered on Monday, January 16, 2012.\n\nIn February 2014, Pennington became the spokesperson for Guaranteed Rate and has been featured in a series of commercials and ads for the Chicago-based mortgage lender.\n\nAs a child, Pennington was plagued with behavioral problems until he was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 17. He also discussed his ADHD with Glenn Beck. Ty has partnered with Shire Plc to raise awareness of ADHD in adults and promote the use of Vyvanse for the treatment of adult ADHD. He has been criticized for promoting the use of ADHD medications such as Adderall without disclosing his sponsorship. He also appeared on TV with Russell Barkley.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father was a Protestant who left the family, leaving her mother to support them. Carney was educated at the Christian Brothers School in Donegall Street in the city, later teaching at the school. She enrolled at Hughes Commercial Academy around 1910, where she qualified as a secretary and shorthand typist, one of the first women in Belfast to do so. However, from the start she was looking towards doing more than just secretarial work.\n\nIn 1912 Carney was in charge of the women's section of the Irish Textile Workers' Union in Belfast, which she founded with Delia Larkin in 1912. During this period she met James Connolly and became his personal secretary. Carney became Connolly's friend and confidant as they worked together to improve the conditions for female labourers in Belfast. Carney and Connolly worked together to try a better women's rights and suffrage among the female factory labourers. According to her biographer Helga Woggon, Carney was the person best acquainted with Connolly's politics. Carney then joined Cumann na mBan, the women's auxiliary of the Irish Volunteers, and attended its first meeting in 1914.\n\nShe was present with Connolly in the Dublin General Post Office during the Easter Rising in 1916. Carney was the only woman present during the initial occupation of the building, which she entered armed with a typewriter and a Webley revolver. While not a combatant, she was given the rank of adjutant and was among the final group (including Connolly and Patrick Pearse) to leave the GPO. After Connolly became wounded, she refused to leave his side. This was despite direct orders from Pearse and Connolly. She had earlier taken the wounded Connolly's final dictated orders. Carney, alongside Elizabeth O'Farrell and Julia Grenan left the GPO with the rest of the rebels after their surrender.\n\nAfter her capture, she was held in Kilmainham Gaol and was then moved to Mountjoy Prison. Carney, alongside Helena Molony, Maria Perolz, Brigid Foley and Ellen O'Ryan and others were moved to an English prison. 69 women were released from prison one week after the execution of the Rising's leaders. By August 1916 Carney was imprisoned in Aylesbury prison alongside Nell Ryan and Helena Molony. The three requested that their internee status, and the privileges it brought, be revoked so that they would be held as normal prisoners with Countess Markievicz. Their request was denied, however Carney and Molony were released two days before Christmas 1916. After the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the formation of the Irish Free State, Carney sided with the Anti-Treaty forces and was arrested several times.\n\nDespite her own time of imprisonment, Carney was not opposed to visiting her political friends during their times in prison. It was recorded that she visited Austin Stack in December 1918.\n\nShe was one of the first Irish women to be qualified as a secretary and a short hand typist from Hughes' Commercial Academy. She worked as a clerk and became involved in the Gaelic League in the Suffragist movement and in socialist activities. She met James Connolly in 1912 and consequently became the secretary for the Textile Workers' Union. In 1913 she was heavily involved in the fundraising for the locked-out Dublin labourers. As a result of her deep involvement with the trade union, she met and eventually became Connolly's typist, typing his articles for publication. Aside from being his typist, she became a friend and confidant. According to her biographer, Helga Woggon, she had become the person most closely acquainted with Connolly's beliefs, ideals, and plans.\n\nWhen the Great War commenced in 1914, Carney concurred with Connolly that it was the perfect time to stage a rebellion, even if it was only of a symbolic value.\n\nWhile she was in Cumann na mBan, she taught first aid and developed a proficiency for handling a rifle. On 14 April 1916, she was summoned by Connolly to join him in the insurgents in the General Post Office where they were garrisoned. Initially, Carney was the only woman at the headquarters of the General Post Office and one of the three remaining women when the garrison had to evacuate the building when it was burned and had to relocate to Moore Street. After Connolly became wounded, she stayed with him. Afterwards, Carney was arrested and held in Kilmainham, Mountjoy, and Aylesbury Jails until the Christmas of 1916.\n\nIn the 1917 Belfast Cumann na mBan convention, she was the delegate.\n\nShe stood for Parliament as a Sinn Féin candidate for Belfast Victoria in the 1918 General Election. She polled 4.05% of the vote, gaining 539 votes. Carney lost to the Labour Unionists. Having lost, she decided instead to continue her work at the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union until 1928. By 1924 she had become a member of the Labour Party. In the 1930s she joined the Belfast Socialist Party.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, Carney became a lot more disillusioned with politics. She was very critical and outspoken of Éamon de Valera and his governments.\n\nIn 1928 she married George McBride, a Protestant Orangeman and former member of the Ulster Volunteers. Ironically, the formation of the Ulster Volunteers prompted the formation of the Irish Volunteers, of which Carney was a member. Carney alienated anyone in her life that did not support her marriage to George McBride. McBride was however a fellow socialist. She continued to be involved in the trade union movement, working for the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.\n\nA number of serious health problems limited her political activities in the late 1930s. Carney died in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 21 November 1943, and is buried in Milltown Cemetery. Her resting place was found years later and a headstone was erected by the National Graves Association, Belfast. An oration was done then by Belfast Republican, Liam Rice. Because Carney married a Protestant and former Orangeman, she was not allowed to have his name (McBride) on her gravestone due to the religious differences. They were married for fifteen years and George McBride never remarried after Carney's early death.\n\nIn 2013, the Seventieth Anniversary of Carney's death was remembered by the Socialist Republican Party. Almost one hundred people attended as a short parade followed, marking an commemorating the work Carney did for the cause. She was placed in high esteem among the other hundreds of radical women, who stood up for what they believed in, regardless of the consequences they faced.\n\n"}
