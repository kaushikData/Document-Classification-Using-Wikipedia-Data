He studied at the University of Puerto Rico-R.U.M. where he received a B.S. and M.S. in physics in 1970 and 1972, respectively. He later studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received a Ph.D. in physics in 1980. Between 1970 and 1974, he worked as an instructor and assistant professor of physics at the University of Puerto Rico. He joined Goddard Space Flight Center in 1980, where he has held multiple positions. He currently is a staff scientist in the Geospace Physics Laboratory of the Heliophysics Science Division at Goddard. He has served as Adjunct Visiting Physics Professor at the Universidad de Concepcion (Chile), at the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and at the Universidad de Alcalá de Henáres-Madrid (Spain).\n\nViñas has pioneered methods for the analysis of plasma particle detectors on board spacecraft. He has conceived and developed a technique for the determination of the fluid moments of velocity distribution function in space plasma measurements from particle detectors. This method is currently being tested for implementation on board any satellite CPU processing unit with particle detectors, to reduce the amount of data required to compute the moments on ground with only a small amount of measurements required via telemetry to unpack the physical quantities on ground. Viñas has also pioneer work to resolve the geometrical properties, propagation velocity, and characteristics of shock waves from simple conservation principles. His work has received national and international recognition (known as the Viñas-Scudder Method) because it is the most accurate and robust method for in-situ shock characteristics determination from space plasma measurements. The Viñas-Scudder method have been implemented into an Interactive Data Language (IDL) visualization tool named SDAT (Shock and Discontinuities Analysis Tool) for distribution to the scientific community and investigators interested in shock physics.\n\nViñas is a staff astrophysicist at the Geospace Physics Laboratory of the Heliophysics Science Division at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Viñas continues actively in research and lecturing at various national and international research centers and universities, He is also a post-doctoral mentor and adviser to many national and international young scientists. He is currently an active member of the American Physical Society (APS), the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and a founding member of the Latin American Association for Space Geophysics (ALAGE).\n\n\n"}

(He had successfully passed an entrance exam for studio sound engineers in 1943.) In 1946, he worked in the research department, making contact with Pierre Schaeffer (a member of the association \"Work and Culture\" (\"Travail et Culture\") in association with Louis Pauwels).\n\nIn 1958, with the publication of his book about the 1954 wave of UFOs (\"Mystérieux Objets Célestes\") in France, Michel devised a theory called orthoténie with the help of Jacques Bergier on the corner of a restaurant tablecloth. Michel posited so-called \"alignments\": Straight lines which corresponded to large circles traced and centered on the earth. Michel claimed that UFO sightings could be concentrated along these grid lines. He proposed, for example, that there was a line known as “Bavic” (for “Bayonne - Vichy”) where, out of nine UFO observations cited in the press on 24 September 1954, six aligned (Bayonne, Lencouacq, Tulle, Ussel, Gelles, Vichy).\n\nA member of the editorial board of \"Lights in the Night\" (\"Lumières dans la nuit\") since 1969, he wrote numerous articles on UFOs, mysticism, the animal kingdom as well as other topics in various journals. In the journal \"The Life of the Animals\" (\"La vie des bêtes\"), during the 1960s, he authored the column \"The Mysteries of the Animal Kingdom\" (\"Les mystères du monde animal\").

Since moving to Australia, she has become one of the correspondents covering Australia for the Philippines' ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.\n\nParedes graduated from high school in 2000 at the School of the Holy Spirit (SHSQC), a private, all-girls Roman Catholic school in Quezon City. She then moved on to the Ateneo de Manila University, where she received her Bachelor of Arts in Communication in 2004.\n\nShe first ventured into modeling in her junior year in college, doing a commercial for a facial wash, and soon endorsing a clothing line. Initially, Ala was perceived to have the advantage of a familiar family name: she is the second daughter of singer Jim Paredes of the APO Hiking Society. But she soon became popular in her own right, taking up social causes just as her father, well known for his advocacies, did before her.\nModel in Globe Telecom's TV Ad \"ARE YOU ONE OF US?\" early 2000\n\nIn her first forays as a television personality, doing television ads, she quickly became a recognizable figure, distinguished by her morena (malay brown) complexion and curly hair, a sharp contrast to the traditional look of models at the time. The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism took note of her unusual success and said:\n\nAt around the same time, Paredes began blogging regularly, with her blog soon becoming popular and earning her a reputation as a celebrity blogger – a role she would later use to promote environmental issues.\n\nParedes' modeling career soon burgeoned into a television career. She continued modelling occasionally but became a regular VJ for ABS-CBN's music channel Myx, and then later the host of IslaMusik, a television show on ABC 5 featuring a musicians from all over the Philippines. She also often served as a presenter at numerous events. As a writer, she also became an advice columnist for Pink magazine.\n\nIn 2005, Paredes became the frontwoman of a Pinoy rock band Hiraya when the original vocalist left. Guitarist Mark Verzo, bassist Marco Cuneta on bass, and drummer Paulo Tomas recruited her to become the replacement vocalist. The band had already released an EP, with their previous vocalist, when Ala took over. She stayed with the band until a short time before she moved to Australia with her family in 2006.\n\nIn 2006, the Paredes family decided to migrate to Australia – a decision which Jim Paredes explained was related to a desire for greater personal development. The move generated some controversy when a copyeditor for a prominent Philippine newspaper wrote a headline that said Mr. Paredes, known for his activism, was \"giving up on the Philippines.\" Both Jim and Ala Paredes protested that this was a miscategorization of their family's motives for moving. The paper eventually apologized to the Paredes family for the original, inaccurate headline of the article. Mr Paredes later said that he \"felt bad not so much that people misread me as a person (that's hurtful, yes) but more so that they may slip deeper into despair by such a false story. That's the last thing we need,\" and Ala expressed similar sentiments.\n\nEven after migrating to a new country, however, Ala Paredes continued to be deeply involved in things Filipino – this time, specifically the Filipino community in Australia. In the same year that the Paredeses moved to Australia, she was recruited by ABS-CBN Global, the international multi-platform media company of Filipino media giant ABS-CBN, to be a correspondent for Balitang Australia, a weekly news and feature program catering specifically to Filipino Australians.\n\nParedes later decided to take up an illustration course from the Sydney Design Institute, graduating in December 2009.\n\nUpon graduation, Paredes served as the official courtroom sketch artist at the trial of Andal Ampatuan Jr., the prime suspect in the Maguindanao massacre. Paredes had gone on vacation in the Philippines to spend the holidays with relatives, when a friend of hers who worked at the Supreme Court of the Philippines called about an open position for a courtroom sketch artist at the Ampatuan trial. Courtroom sketches were needed because media coverage at the trial was restricted.\n\nDescribing the moment, she said that she \"“immediately called my friend back 10 seconds after receiving her message and accepted the offer. We did not talk about the (pay).”\" Noting the importance of the case, she said that \"“At a time when the nation is still grieving, I feel like this is my way of getting involved,”\" and \"“I thought this is my own way of giving public service, especially when media can’t be there.”\"\n"}

The magazine is annually published by Pedicel AS in five issues, in addition to six subscriber newsletters that are distributed digitally or as paper edition. Typically ca. 70 pages long, the magazine includes features, wine reviews and a column by Jancis Robinson MW translated into Norwegian.\n\nThe motivation behind founding the magazine was, according to a statement in a 2010 \"Vinforum\" editorial by Dybvik, because the Norwegian alcohol monopoly chain store Vinmonopolet \"failed in its responsibility to its customers by practicing an arrogance with the inherent insolence of dictating the tastes of the Norwegian people. And worst of all, they managed to convince the Norwegian people they were doing a good job.\" At the time Vinmonopolet had an Italian wine selection which totalled 14 labels (including reds, whites and sparkling).

He was awarded a five-year fellowship to the Rockefeller Institute, and earned a Ph.D. in biology in 1961. He became an associate professor at the Institute in 1966. He wrote four books while there, as well as editing others' work, and writing numerous papers and articles. He married Kytja Scott Voeller, whom he met at graduate school, and they had three children.\n\nHe came out at the age of 29, and divorced from his wife in 1971.

They were first mentioned in a document of 1320 and lived in the villages of Ķoniņciems, Pliķu ciems, Kalējciems, Ziemeļciems, Viesalgciems, Sausgaļciems, and Dragūnciems (now in Kuldīga municipality). All of them possessed independent farms (did not belong to any lord), but they were not allowed to own their own serfs. They had only one landlord komtur of Kuldīga and they were related to him only by military service in case of war. Curonians usually served as a light cavalry in the Livonian Order army. Sources mentions that Curonian Kings fought in the Livonian War against invading Russians, as Johann Renner's chronicle reports:\n\nCuronian Kings also was allowed to practice some aspects of paganism during period of Livonian Confederation. Despite formal Christianisation after Livonian Crusade Curonian Kings owned a sacred forest where nobody was allowed to hunt or walk. It was used as a place of worship and for cremation of the dead. Hunt was allowed only once a year before Christmas but part of the game must be used as offering. Most likely those were Curonian Kings which was described by Guillebert de Lannoy in 1413 when he traveled from Konigsberg to Novgorod. He writes that there is a sect of curonians who still burns their dead in a sacred groves with garments and weapons with them. Part of this forest has survived until 21st century and local people still maintains it with great respect.\n\nIn 1504 master of the Livonian order Walter von Plettenberg awarded Curonian King Andrejs Peniķis, commander of curonian light cavalry for his loyal service during livonian wars with Muscovite Russia.\n\nIt is known that in the 17th century Curonian Kings had their own coats of arms. In the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia they gradually lost their privileges, but they were still counted as separate class. They were not recognized landlords but maintained middle position between landlords and peasants. However, in 18th century they were likened to serfs, although with smaller socage duties.\n\nTheir status was again recognized in 19th century, although they were not recognized as part of local nobility. In 1860 there were 833 Curonian kings living in Courland Governorate. While the Curonian tribe had long been assimilated by the Latvians, the Curonian Kings preserved a separate identity and traditions.

In the final season, he marries his long-time love, Kurt. Discussing public response to his character, Criss stated that he particularly enjoyed comments from \"people from parts of the world who are maybe not as exposed to certain ideologies\", but had reconsidered their stance on relationships and human rights as a result of the Blaine and Kurt storyline. He called this response \"phenomenal\" and said, \"I was a straight kid growing up in a very gay community and it's something that I've had to watch so many friends have to struggle with and have no place to go to identify in kind of a grander media culture. To be a small piece of that machine is incredibly wonderful.\"\n\nHe was nominated for an Emmy Award for writing the song \"This Time\" one in a handful of the show’s original songs over its six season run, for the \"Glee\" finale, “Dreams Come True”.\n\nIn 2017, Criss reunited with \"Glee\" creator Ryan Murphy to portray serial killer Andrew Cunanan in the of Murphy's anthology series \"American Crime Story\". His performance received acclaim from critics, and earned Criss an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, Criss made his feature film debut in the comedy \"Girl Most Likely\". It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and was released nationwide on July 19, 2013. Previously titled \"Imogene\", the film starred Kristen Wiig, Annette Bening, and Matt Dillon.\n\nCriss began his solo music career while attending the University of Michigan. Playing in small venues, he developed his own musical repertoire which today consists of standards from the Great American Songbook, contemporary songs, Disney songs, and his own compositions.\n\nOn July 20, 2010, Criss released an independently-produced EP called \"Human\". Describing his album as \"soul-folk\" to \"Entertainment Weekly\", it peaked at No. 17 on the \"Billboard\" Top Heatseekers Albums chart. On December 10, 2010, Criss became the 400,000th member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). In April 2011, he signed with Sony Music Entertainment. He is in the process of recording a full-length studio album, with a release date yet to be determined.\n\nIn January 2013, Criss performed for US President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Vice President Joe Biden at the inaugural balls of the 57th Presidential Inauguration.\n\nDuring a benefit concert for public school arts on April 14, 2013, Criss was made an honorary member of Yale University's a cappella singing group The Whiffenpoofs.\n\nCriss' first solo music tour visited 17 cities in the United States, Canada, and France from May 29–June 30, 2013, and included songs from \"Glee\", StarKid, his \"Human\" EP, and new material from his upcoming solo album.\n\nCriss is credited as one of the primary songwriters and composers for StarKid Productions. He has contributed songs to \"A Very Potter Musical\", \"Me and My Dick\" (which became the first-ever student-produced college musical to reach \"Billboard\", debuting at No. 11 on the Top Cast Albums chart), \"Little White Lie\", and \"A Very Potter Senior Year\". Subsequently, Criss solely composed all the songs and music for \"A Very Potter Sequel\", its companion album \"A Very StarKid Album\", and \"Starship\", which landed at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Top Cast Albums chart, and at No. 134 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\n\nIn November 2011, Criss participated in StarKid's first national concert tour, The SPACE Tour, for the New York and Boston shows, and, in the summer of 2012, he joined them again for their second national tour, Apocalyptour, for the Los Angeles and New York shows.\n\nAs Blaine, Criss features in many musical performances on \"Glee\", which have been released as singles, available for download. His first performance, \"Teenage Dream\" by Katy Perry, was featured on the soundtrack album \"\". It reached number eight on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the week ending November 27, 2010, and number one on the Billboard Digital Songs chart.\n\nIt was the best-selling song in the US that week, selling 214,000 copies, the largest figure for a \"Glee\" title. It was only the second US-certified gold single in the show's history. Both \"Billboard\" Jillian Mapes and Erica Futterman of \"Rolling Stone\" deemed \"Teenage Dream\" the best song of \"Never Been Kissed\", the episode in which it featured.\n\nThe \"New York Daily News\" Anthony Benigno gave the song an \"A\", and noted that it was \"flawless\" and improved on Perry's original. The performance was nominated for the Best Gay Moment of the Year and Favorite Music Video awards at the 2010 \"AfterElton.com\" Visibility Awards. A \"Billboard\" cover-feature on Criss noted that the performance \"arguably ushered in the trend of more current pop hits being reworked by the [\"Glee\"] cast.\"\n\nLater songs performed by Blaine and the Warblers became popular enough to warrant a Warbler soundtrack album, \"\". It debuted at No. 2 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and No. 1 on \"Billboard\" Soundtracks chart, selling 86,000 copies in its first week. The Warbler tracks had sold over 1.3 million copies as singles by the time the album was released.\n\nFrom May 21–July 3, 2011, Criss and the cast of \"Glee\" performed in Glee Live! In Concert!, touring the US, Canada, England, and Ireland. According to \"Billboard\", it was the 16th most successful concert tour of 2011, grossing more than $40 million, with total attendance topping 485,000. All 40 dates sold out, including shows at Staples Center, Nassau Coliseum, and The O Arenas in London and Dublin.\n\nFor Season 6 of \"Glee\", Criss composed \"Rise\" for the episode \"The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester\" and \"This Time\" for the series finale. Criss was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for writing \"This Time\".\n\nCriss has appeared on the magazine covers of \"Billboard,\" \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Out\", \"Playbill\", \"TV Guide\", \"Da Man\", \"GT\", \"Prestige\", and \"Essential Homme\".

{"id": "1765351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1765351", "title": "Edward Askew Sothern", "text": "Edward Askew Sothern\n\nEdward Askew Sothern (1 April 1826 – 20 January 1881) was an English actor known for his comic roles in Britain and America, particularly Lord Dundreary in \"Our American Cousin\".\n\nSothern was born in Liverpool, the son of a merchant. He began studying medicine, and his parents hoped that he would become a minister, but he decided against pursuing those professions. He worked as a clerk in the late 1840s and married Frances Emily \"Fannie\" Stewart (d. 1882). He began acting as an amateur in 1848 under the stage name of Douglas Stewart. In 1849 he appeared in his first professional engagement at Saint Helier in Jersey, as Claude Melnotte in Bulwer Lytton's \"The Lady of Lyons\". In the early 1850s, he played in various English companies without particular success in Portsmouth, Wolverhampton and Birmingham.\n\nSothern travelled to America in 1852, first playing Dr. Pangloss in \"The Heir at Law\" in Boston, Massachusetts, with John Lacy's company at the National Theatre. He then played at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston and at Barnum's American Museum in New York. In 1854, he joined the company at Wallack's Theatre. In the early part of his career, Sothern's wife often performed with him. By 1856, he had begun using his own name, Sothern, on stage. He had become associated with Laura Keene's company in New York by 1856. He finally gained attention at Wallack's Theatre in New York starring as Armand in \"Camille\". The critic Clement Scott noted that while Sothern was \"as handsome a man as ever stood on the stage\", he was not naturally suited to romantic roles.\n\nAs a result of his success in \"Camille\", Sothern was given a part in Tom Taylor's \"Our American Cousin\" at Laura Keene's Theatre. This piece would later become famous as the play that Abraham Lincoln was watching when he was assassinated. Sothern's role was Lord Dundreary, a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. At first, he was reluctant to accept the role; it was so small and unimportant that he felt it beneath him and feared it might damage his reputation. He mentioned his qualms to his friend, Joseph Jefferson, who had been cast in the leading role of Asa Trenchard in the play. Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: \"There are no small parts, only small actors.\"\n\nOn 15 October 1858, \"Our American Cousin\" premiered in New York. After a couple of unhappy weeks in the small role, Sothern began portraying the role as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his \"bwother\" Sam. His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and merry mockery on both sides of the Atlantic. His exaggerated, droopy side-whiskers became known as \"Dundrearys\". Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time. Sothern made his London debut in the role when the play ran for 496 performances at the Haymarket Theatre in 1861, earning rave reviews. \"The Athenaeum\" wrote, \"it is certainly the funniest thing in the world... a vile caricature of a vain nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent\".\n\nDundreary became a popular recurring character, and Sothern successfully revived the play many times, making Dundreary by far his most famous role. A number of spin-off works were also created, including Charles Gayler's sequel, \"Our American Cousin at Home, or, Lord Dundreary Abroad\" (Buffalo, New York, 1860, and then New York City, 1861) and H. J. Byron's \"Dundreary Married and Done For\". Sothern wrote his own play, \"Suspense\", produced for Keene's 1860-61 season. He won wide popularity from his interpretation of Sam Slingsby in John Oxenford's \"Brother Sam\" (1862; revived in 1865), a play about Dundreary's brother.\n\nIn 1864, Sothern created the title role in Tom Robertson's \"David Garrick\" at the Haymarket Theatre. The play was a great success. \"The Times\" praised Sothern's acting in the Act II scene where Sothern depicted \"the most extravagant form of drunkenness... perpetually brought into contact with the real agony of mind which is now on the point of casting aside the mask of debauchery\". He also appeared in Robertson's \"Home\" and later claimed to have written some of the best scenes in each work (a claim that was disputed by Robertson). Other plays written for the now-famous Sothern were \"The Woman in Mauve\", by Watts Phillips; \"The Favourite of Fortune\" and \"A Hero of Romance\" by Westland Marston; \"A Lesson for Life\" by Tom Taylor; and \"An English Gentleman\" by H. J. Byron (1871) at the Haymarket. Sothern continued to act mostly in London until 1876, but also toured extensively in the British provinces, North America and Europe.\n\nSothern became popular with Robertson's crowd, including with the Haymarket's manager, John Baldwin Buckstone, actor J. L. Toole, and dramatists Byron and W. S. Gilbert, who later wrote three plays for him, \"Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith\" (1876), \"The Ne'er-do-Weel\" (1878), and \"Foggerty's Fairy\" (1881). He was known as a sportsman and bon vivant and became famous for his magic tricks, conversation and, especially, his practical jokes (he was born on April fool's day). Sothern and his friends demanded that clerks sell them goods not carried by the store in question, staged mock arguments on public omnibuses, ran fake advertisements in newspapers, paid street urchins to annoy passers-by and so forth. At one restaurant, Toole and Sothern removed the silver and hid under the table. When the unfortunate waiter found the dining room empty and the silver gone, he ran to report the theft. By the time he returned, Toole and Sothern had re-set the table as if nothing had happened.\n\nSothern left England to tour in America in early 1876 and wrote to Gilbert to be ready with a play by October that would feature him in a serious role. This play eventually became \"Dan'l Druce\". However, Sothern produced but did not star in the play. Gilbert soon wrote another play for Sothern, this time a comedy, \"The Ne'er-do-Weel\". Sothern was not pleased with the work, and Gilbert offered to take it back. Although it was eventually produced, Sothern did not appear in it. Sothern had already paid Gilbert for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back. After various arrangements between Gilbert and Sothern involving American productions of another Gilbert play, \"Engaged\" (1877), Gilbert finally promised, in 1878, to write a new play for Sothern. This was to be \"Foggerty's Fairy\".\n\nSothern's biographer T. Edgar Pemberton noted that one role he regretted not playing was Cheviot in \"Engaged\". Sothern continued to tour and perform Dundreary and other works. In October 1877 at the Academy of Music in New York, he played the title role in \"Othello\".\n\nSothern's next great role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's \"The Crushed Tragedian\" (1878, originally named \"The Prompter's Box\") at the Haymarket. \"The Era\" admired \"the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes\" of his portrayal. He next appeared in \"The Hornet's Nest\" by Byron at the Haymarket. \"The Crushed Tragedian\" was not a great success in London, but it became a hit in New York. \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" raved, \"With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and it is as though he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ and you know that he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous.\" In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in Lord Lytton's play \"Money\" as Sir Frederick Blount.\n\nIn the autumn of 1879, after a long summer fishing trip, Sothern was on another American tour. \"The Era\" wrote in October 1879 that \"It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's [American] engagement, to bring out revivals of \"The Crushed Tragedian\", \"Dundreary\", and \"David Garrick\", the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being reserved for the spring engagement.\" On 29 February 1880 \"The Era\" reported: \"Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 guineas, he would not take 6,000 guineas for it now. It is a piece of the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense.\" The same issue of \"The Era\" states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the Gaiety Theatre, London in \"Foggerty's Fairy\", as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour. Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the fall, although he fulfilled his performing commitments. Sothern returned to England for a six-week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce \"Fogerty's Fairy\" in New York. After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the fall, and his health declined until he died in January 1881, never having performed Gilbert's play.\nSothern died at his home in Cavendish Square, London, at the age of 54 and is buried in Southampton Old Cemetery, Southampton. Sothern was such a notorious practical joker that many of his friends missed his funeral, thinking it was a joke. His sister, Mary Cowan, was the principal beneficiary of his last will, signed shortly before his death. A previous will had given most of the estate to his widow and children. Sothern's widow contested the will but lost, and it took Cowan until 31 May 1881 to obtain probate. Gilbert suggested that she \"underlet\" \"Foggerty's Fairy\" to him, and he eventually had it produced. Later, she wrote to him: \"Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness & fairness & I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety.\"\n\nSothern and his wife had four children, all of whom became actors: Lytton Edward (1851–1887), Edward Hugh (E. H.), George Evelyn Augustus T. (b. 1870; who used the stage name Sam Sothern) and Eva Mary. E. H. Sothern became prominent on the American stage. Sothern's house in Kensington, London was a resort for people of fashion, and he was as much a favourite in America as in the United Kingdom.\n\nSothern's passion for practical joking amounted almost to a mania. He would often falsely announce the death of a friend or send people on fool's errands. Among his most elaborate practical jokes was the following. When the husband of actress Adelaide Neilson, Philip Henry Lee, visited New York in the mid-19th century, he had been warned about the wild, bohemian behaviour of American authors, but expressed his doubt as to the veracity of the stories. Sothern assured him it was true and arranged a private dinner for Lee with twelve \"writers and critics\", who were really actors. During the dinner, a quarrel arose over literary matters, culminating in a fight breaking out. The men, apparently drunk, brandished an axe, knives and revolvers. The room was filled with shouts, shots and struggle. Someone thrust a knife into Lee's hand, saying, \"Defend yourself! This is butchery, sheer butchery!\" Sothern advised him to \"Keep cool, and don't get shot\", before the joke was exposed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5847230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5847230", "title": "Fidelia Fielding", "text": "Fidelia Fielding\n\nFidelia Ann Hoscott Smith Fielding (1827–1908), also known as Dji'ts Bud dnaca (\"Flying Bird\"), was the daughter of Bartholomew Valentine Smith (c. 1811–1843) and Sarah A. Wyyougs (1804–1868), and granddaughter of Martha Shantup Uncas (1761–1859).\n\nShe married Mohegan mariner William H. Fielding (1811–1843), and they lived in one of the last \"tribe houses,\" a reservation-era log cabin dwelling. She was known to be an independent-minded woman who was well-versed in tribal traditions, and who continued to speak the traditional Mohegan Pequot language during her elder years.\n\nFielding insisted upon retaining the everyday use of the Mohegan language during an era when most New England Native peoples were becoming increasingly fluent in English. Her maternal grandmother Martha Uncas spoke it with family members, and other Mohegan people continued to speak and understand some of the language, but by 1900, few were as fluent as Fidelia and her sister. As an adult, Fielding kept four diaries in the language, which later became vital sources for reconstructing the syntax of Mohegan Pequot and related Algonquian languages.\n\nFielding was regarded as a \"nanu\" (respected elder woman) and mentor to Gladys Tantaquidgeon, a traditional Mohegan woman who also studied anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania and served as a research assistant to Frank Speck. Tantaquidgeon conducted field work and service work for a variety of Native communities and agencies before coming home to Uncasville. In Uncasville, Gladys and her family founded the Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum, and she became a respected elder herself, working on material and cultural preservation.\n\nMany modern sources suggest that anthropologist Frank G. Speck, as a child, lived with Fidelia Fielding, but there is no evidence to support that in any Mohegan tribal records or oral memories. Speck recalled, in his own publications and correspondence, that he first met Fielding around 1900, when he was an anthropology student at Columbia University. Speck was in the midst of a camping trip to Fort Shantok, Connecticut, when he met up with several Mohegan young men---Burrill Tantaquidgeon, Jerome Roscoe Skeesucks, and Edwin Fowler---who introduced him to Fielding. This encounter sparked a lifelong friendship with the Tantaquidgeon family. Speck interviewed Fielding, recording notes on the Mohegan language that he shared with his professor, John Dyneley Prince, who encouraged further research. Fielding eventually allowed Speck to view her personal daybooks (also called diaries) in which she recorded brief observations on the weather and local events, so that he could understand and accurately record the written version of the Mohegan language.\n\nThis material that Speck collected from Fielding inspired four publications in 1903 alone: “The Remnants of our Eastern Indian Tribes” in The American Inventor, Vol. 10, pp. 266–268; “A Mohegan-Pequot Witchcraft Tale” in Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 16, pp. 104–107; “The Last of the Mohegans” in The Papoose Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 2–5; and “Mohegan Traditions of ‘Muhkeahweesug,’ the Little Men” in The Papoose No . 7, pp. 11–14. Speck also co-authored a 1904 article with J. Dyneley Prince, “The Modem Pequots and their Language” in American Anthropologist, n. s., Vol. V pp. 193–212.\n\nIn 1908, after Fielding's death, her relative John Cooper gave her diaries to Frank Speck for safekeeping. Speck later deposited them in George Gustav Heye's Heye Foundation/Museum of the American Indian in New York City. These documents were later relocated, as part of the Huntington collection, to the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections at Cornell University, where they are archived today.\n\nFidelia Hoscott Fielding died in 1908, and was buried at the Ancient Burial Grounds of the Mohegans at Fort Shantok State Park in Montville, Connecticut. A memorial marker was placed there to honor her, at a ceremony with an estimated 1,000 people in attendance on May 24, 1936.\n\nCredited with being an instrumental influence in recording and preserving the language, in 1994 she was posthumously inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame under the category \"Education & Preservation\". Fielding is one of only three American Indians who have been inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame. Years later, Gladys Tantaquidgeon, a Mohegan woman trained by Fielding who similarly insisted on preserving traditional ways, was also inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring Fielding's lifetime, parents were reluctant to use or teach the Mohegan language to their children, for fear of prejudice or reprisals from the English speakers around them. In the present day, linguists from the Mohegan Language Project, including Fidelia Fielding's relative Stephanie Fielding, have been carefully working with materials compiled and archived by Fielding and Speck in order to reconstruct and reanimate Mohegan-Pequot as a living language for new generations.\n"}
{"id": "48248522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48248522", "title": "George Eacker", "text": "George Eacker\n\nGeorge I. Eacker ( 1774 – January 4, 1804) was a New York lawyer. He fatally shot Philip Hamilton, the oldest son of Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, in a duel on November 23, 1801, in Weehawken, New Jersey.\n\nEacker was born in Palatine, New York. He was the son of Jacob Eacker, who fought in the American Revolution and served as a county judge and New York State Assemblyman, and Anna Margaret Finck, daughter of Andreas Finck. He had one younger brother, Jacob I., and four sisters.\n\nHe attended a preparatory school in Schenectady, New York, and graduated from Columbia College in 1793. He then studied law under Henry Brockholst Livingston, a future Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nEacker was admitted to the New York bar at age 21. He soon built his practice in Manhattan into a lucrative business, allowing him to take a house on Wall Street and employ a married couple as his valet and housekeeper. He gained popularity in New York City's well-to-do social circles as a lawyer, Freemason, cavalry captain, and fire brigade inspector.\n\nFor an unknown offense in 1798, which historian Eric Monkkonen interprets as an earlier duel or conflict, Eacker appeared in court and paid a recognizance, likely as a bond for good behavior.\n\nIn 1801, Eacker was appointed as a master in the New York Court of Chancery, then the highest court in the state.\n\nEacker was selected in 1801 to deliver the Fourth of July oration at an Independence Day celebration held in New York City by a brigade of the New York State Militia, the Tammany Society, and two of the city's labor organizations, the Mechanics' Society and Coopers' Society. The Tammany Society, better known as Tammany Hall, was a Democratic-Republican party political organization that Aaron Burr had built into a political machine. In politics, Eacker was known to be aligned with Burr.\n\nAccording to a supporter, the speech that Eacker delivered was commended by \"nearly everybody,\" except for partisans who were \"blinded... to every virtue\" by \"party spirit, which at that time was very bitter\". Some accounts questioned whether the speech was critical of Alexander Hamilton, as it was later characterized; according to a 19th century historian who relied on Eacker's younger brother as a source, the speech was entirely patriotic and did not name or allude to Hamilton.\n\nOn November 20, 1801, a Friday night, Eacker attended a play at the Park Theatre with his fiancée Harriet Livingston, a daughter of Walter Livingston and Cornelia Schuyler. Philip Hamilton (the eldest son of Alexander Hamilton) and Stephen Price approached or entered Eacker's box together and loudly ridiculed him. Eacker called them \"damned rascals\", and in response to that insult, as was not uncommon at the time, they each challenged Eacker to a duel.\n\nPrice faced the 27-year-old Eacker in a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey on November 22. Four shots were exchanged, but neither party was injured.\n\nAt the same location on the following day, Eacker fatally shot the 19-year-old Hamilton in a second duel.\n\nIn a letter to Rufus King, Robert Troup wrote of Alexander Hamilton, \"Never did I see a man so completely overwhelmed with grief as Hamilton had been.\" Nevertheless, after Philip's death, the elder Hamilton was said to be civil and professional in his relationship with Eacker. Hamilton would later die in a duel with Aaron Burr only a few years later, on July 11, 1804, on the same dueling ground in Weehawken.\n\nEacker died on January 4, 1804. His death was attributed to consumption, or tuberculosis. According to Eacker's brother, the prolonged illness began in January 1802 on a bitterly cold night when Eacker fought a raging fire with his brigade, and contracted a severe cold that \"settled upon his lungs\" until his death.\n\nHis remains were interred at St. Paul's Chapel with military honors, and his funeral procession included members of the military, fire brigade, and the Howard Lodge of Freemasons.\n\nEacker and his fiancée never married. In January 1808, Harriet Livingston married the steamboat inventor Robert Fulton, with whom she had four children.\n\nEacker appeared as a minor character in the 2015 Broadway musical \"Hamilton\", in which the musical number \"Blow Us All Away\" dramatized his duel with Philip Hamilton. The role of Eacker was originated on Broadway by a member of the show's ensemble, Ephraim M. Sykes, who also appears as Eacker on the original cast recording.\n\n"}

He was Mayor of Chatham Borough, New Jersey from 1934 to 1938 and is most notable today for the progress he made in the 1930s towards solving the Oak Island treasure mystery, described as the costliest treasure hunt ever.\n\nIn 1919 he became vice president and general manager of the Hedden Iron Construction Company in Hillside, New Jersey. They were fabricators and erectors of structural steel. On the sale in 1931 of the business to Bethlehem Steel Company, he became plant manager of the \"Hedden\" works.\n\nOn May 8, 1928, he read an article on Oak Island in \"The New York Times Magazine.\" Hedden was fascinated by the story and determined to purchase the island and search for the treasure. He spent much of his fortune in search of the treasure. His search lasted from 1934 to 1936, when he helped arrange for New York University engineering professor Edwin Hamilton to take over. Hedden bought the east end of the island in 1935 and attempted to drain the so-called Money Pit with a pump. His discoveries during the search included finding an inscribed stone, believed to be Masonic, at Joudrey's Cove in 1936.\n\nLives and vast amounts of wealth were lost. The treasure still remains, and other treasure hunters have since followed. Hedden is the most notable due to his large investments, engineering background, and early discoveries.\n"}

His father was a judge.\n\nHorten was apprenticed in a Düsseldorf department store belonging to Leonhard Tietz before working for the Duisburg department store of the \"Gebrüder Alsberg\" (Alsberg brothers) company. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Horten was able to acquire the company from the Jewish owners, Strauß and Lauter, who fled to the United States. He was aided in this transaction by the banker Wilhelm Reinhold of the Commerz- and Disconto-Bank. The bank was to become a partner in the newly formed Horten & Co.\n\nUntil 1939, Horten acquired several other department stores and enjoyed a good relationship with the Nazi government despite that his grandfather, the (later) Catholic saint Titus Maria Horten died in custody in 1936. Horten was able to acquire the distribution rights to certain goods which were scarce due to war.\n\nAfter the Second World War Horten was interned by the British Army in 1947 in Recklinghausen. Following a hunger strike he was released in 1948. He soon continued with the consolidation and expansion of his company, which he still owned. Horten introduced Germany's first supermarket after a visit to the United States, the copying of this business model expanding the group quickly. In 1968, with 25,000 staff and turnover of €1 billion, he floated the group on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 1972 Horten sold his majority stake and retired from the business, which controversially lost a great deal of value soon afterwards. In 1994 the chain was bought by Kaufhof Holding AG, merged into the German retail group METRO AG in 1996.\n\nIn 1960, Horten met 19-year-old Austrian Heidi Jelinek, a woman 32 years his junior, in a hotel bar in Velden am Wörthersee. The couple married on 23 July 1966 in Düsseldorf-Lohausen and moved to Croglio in the Swiss canton of Ticino at the end of 1968. Horten enjoyed living the life of a wealthy man: he owned a BAC 1-11 as a private jet, a series of private yachts named after Carinthia, and a villa in Mülheim an der Ruhr. In Duisburg, the centre of his business activities, he made donations to the tennis club, the carnival and the zoo. The Helmut Horten Stiftung promotes medical research.\n\nHis widow inherited his $1 billion fortune, and lives today between homes in Croglio, Lyford Cay, by the Wörthersee in Austria and a penthouse in Vienna.

The case was based entirely on what the judge called \"very powerful circumstantial evidence,\" with no direct evidence that Sterling shared any classified information with Risen. In May 2015, Sterling was sentenced to 3½ years in prison. In 2016 and 2017, he filed complaints and wrote letters regarding mistreatment, lack of medical treatment for life-threatening conditions, and false allegations against him by corrections officers leading to further punitive measures. He was released from prison in January 2018.\n\nSterling was born in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Sterling earned a political science degree at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, in 1989. In 1992, he graduated from the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri as a Juris Doctor.\n\nSterling joined the CIA on May 14, 1993. In 1995, he became operations officer in the Iran task force of the CIA's Near East and South Asia division. He held a top secret security clearance and had access to sensitive compartmented information, including classified cables, CIA informants, and operations.\n\nAfter training in Persian in 1997, he was sent first to Bonn, Germany, and two years later to New York City to recruit Iranian nationals as agents for the CIA as part of a secret intelligence operation involving Iran's weapons capabilities. From early 1998 to May 2000, Sterling assumed responsibility as case officer for a Russian emigre with an engineering background in nuclear physics and production, whom the CIA employed as a carrier to pass flawed design plans to the Iranians.\n\nIn April 2000, Sterling filed a complaint with the CIA's Equal Employment Office about management's alleged racial discrimination practices. The CIA subsequently revoked Sterling's authorization to receive or possess classified documents concerning the secret operation and placed him on administrative leave in March 2001.\n\nAfter the failure of two settlement attempts, his contract with the CIA was terminated on January 31, 2002.\n\nSterling's lawsuit accusing CIA officials of racial discrimination was dismissed by the judge after the government successfully argued the state secrets privilege by alleging the litigation would require disclosure of classified information. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, ruling in 2005 that \"there is no way for Sterling to prove employment discrimination without exposing at least some classified details of the covert employment that gives context to his claim.\"\n\nBetween 2002 and 2004, the U.S. federal government intercepted several interstate emails to and from Sterling, which were \"(...) \"routed through a server located in the Eastern District of Virginia\" (...)\". The authorities also traced telephone calls between Sterling and—according to a senior government official—the journalist and book author James Risen. In the intercepted communications, Sterling allegedly revealed national defense information to an unauthorized person. In March 2003 Sterling also raised concerns with the Senate Intelligence Committee about a \"poorly executed and dangerous Operation Merlin.\"\n\nOn December 22, 2010, U.S. attorney Neil H. MacBride filed an indictment against Jeffrey Alexander Sterling on the Unlawful Retention and Unauthorized Disclosure of National Defense Information, Mail Fraud, Unauthorized Conveyance of Government Property, and Obstruction of Justice. Sterling was arrested on January 6, 2011. Sterling became the fifth individual in the history of the United States who has been charged, under the Espionage Act, with mishandling national defense information.\n\nIn a hearing at the U.S. District Court on January 14, 2011, Sterling's defense attorney, Edward MacMahon, entered a not guilty plea. MacMahon reported to the court that he was still waiting for clearance to discuss the case in detail with his client. Rather than relying exclusively on records of electronic communications to legally establish that Sterling exchanged information with Risen, the prosecution has subpoenaed Risen to testify and reveal his journalistic sources, an effort which Risen and his attorneys are contesting.\n\nSterling, who maintains that his communications with Risen did not involve secret information, was convicted of espionage charges on January 26, 2015. Sentencing was originally scheduled for April 24, but after learning of the sentence of no more than two years’ probation plus a fine given one day earlier to David Petraeus for the misdemeanor of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, Sterling's lawyers submitted a plea that Sterling \"not receive a different form of justice\" than Petraeus, asking for a similarly lenient sentence instead of the 19 to 24 years imprisonment sought by the federal prosecutors. On May 11, 2015, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema sentenced Sterling to 3½ years in prison. Judge Brinkema said there was \"no more critical secret\" than revealing the identity of a man working with the CIA, and that Sterling deserved a harsher penalty than other recent leakers because he had not pleaded guilty or admitted wrongdoing. The judge said she was moved by his accomplishments but needed to send a message to others: \"If you do knowingly reveal these secrets, there's going to be a price to be paid.\" On June 22, 2017, a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the sentence.\n\nJeffrey Alexander Sterling, Bureau of Prisons #38338-044, was located at FCI Englewood. In 2016, Sterling's wife said that she was afraid that Sterling could die of health issues behind bars. In September 2016, Sterling detailed the FBI's continued indifference in his seeking treatment for a severe heart condition, in letters which were published by Common Dreams. In April 2017 Sterling was placed into solitary confinement after he threatened an officer. He was \"denied medication for his heart condition and endured a cardiac-related episode\" while in solitary confinement.\n\nSterling is married to Holly Sterling, a social worker. They met via Match.com. On their second date, they agreed to get married barefoot on the beach. They were married in Jamaica.\n\nSterling earned a national 2010 Anti-Fraud Award from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association for helping break up a Medicare fraud ring, leading to estimated recoveries and savings of US $32 million.\n\n\n"}

His mentor Mel B and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini voted to save him while Simon Cowell and Walsh voted to eliminate him. This meant the result went to deadlock and Akister was eliminated.

He was in the bottom two with Stevi Ritchie in week 7, but was saved after only Simon Cowell voted to send Ritchie through to the quarter-final but Mel B, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Louis Walsh all voted to send Faustini through to the quarter-final. However, after the series ended, voting statistics confirmed that Ritchie had received more votes than Faustini meaning that if Walsh sent the result to deadlock, Ritchie would've been sent through to the quarter-final and Faustini would have been eliminated. He was once again in the bottom two in the semi-final, this time with Lauren Platt. He was saved for a second time with only Fernandez-Versini voted to send Platt through to the final, while Mel B, Walsh and Cowell voted to send Faustini through to the final.

However, the following week, James was in the bottom two with Stevi Richie. The vote again went to deadlock, and James was voted out due to having the fewest public votes. He finished in 8th place. He was given a place in the X Factor Live Tour for coming in the top half, and anybody eliminated after him was in the X Factor Live Tour as well.\n\nStevie \"Stevi\" Ritchie (born Steven Ritchie; 17 September 1980, aged 36) is from Colchester. He was not initially through to the live shows, but Fernandez-Versini brought him back as the Over 25s' wildcard.\n\nAfter the eliminations of Overload Generation in week 1 and Jack Walton and Lola Saunders in week 4, Ritchie was the last wildcard left in the competition. In week 6, Ritchie found himself in the bottom two with fellow Over 25 Jay James. His mentor Cowell and Walsh opted to send him home, but Mel B and Fernandez-Versini, who picked him as the wildcard act and had the deciding vote, opted to send James home, resulting in Ritchie being saved after the result went to deadlock. The following week, he was in the bottom two again with Andrea Faustini and was eliminated by the judges with only his mentor Cowell voting to send Ritchie through to the quarter-final and Mel B, Fernandez-Versini and Walsh voting to send Faustini through to the quarter-final. However voting statistics confirmed that Ritchie had actually received more votes than Faustini, meaning if Walsh sent the vote to deadlock, Ritchie would have been sent through to the quarter-final and Faustini would have been eliminated.\n\nFollowing the X Factor Stevi participated in Celebrity Big Brother for England, where she came 5th with girlfriend Chloe-Jasmine.\n\nThe 'Groups' category was mentored by Louis Walsh.

They have drawn comparisons to former \"X Factor\" contestants Jedward. Originally called Blonde Electric, they changed their name before the live shows. Explaining the reason for their name change, Jazzy said \"Blonde Electric is a little too descriptive. We are going for an independent, strong woman that represents Blonde Electra. That is why, but I like it. I think it's got a good ring to it.\" \n\nBlonde Electra were automatically eliminated in week 1 after receiving the fewest public votes, coming in 16th place.\n\nOnly The Young were a four-piece mixed group consisting of Mikey Bromley (20, Carlisle), Parisa Tarjomani (21, Ramsgate), Betsy-Blue English (19, Brighton), and Charlie George (17, Chartham). The group were created and are currently managed by Jo Perry. Only The Young previously featured George Shelley, who auditioned for the show's ninth series and was added to Union J, who made the live shows, eventually finishing in fourth place in the semi-final. This was when Shelley was later replaced by Bromley. While on the series, Only The Young released their version of Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett's \"Monster Mash\" in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust. Before the show, they auditioned for Capital's Summertime Ball on 21 June, and were chosen to perform at Wembley Stadium alongside Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus, David Guetta, Enrique Iglesias, Little Mix and many other artists. \n\nThey were in the bottom two with Jake Quickenden in week three, but they were saved after receiving only Mel B's vote against them. They were automatically eliminated in week seven as the act with the fewest public votes on Saturday, coming in 7th place.\n\nTwo weeks after being voted off the show, the group announced their first headlining show which would be held in London's Under the Bridge on 28 December 2014, thus becoming the first act of the series to be successful after leaving the show. However, the group have since had to pull out of the event following the death of Tarjomani's mother on 21 December.\n\nOn 19 May 2015, the group announced that they had signed a record deal with Warner Music. The music video of their debut single \"I Do\" was released on 8 June 2015, but their YouTube account was hacked four days later, which led to its deletion. It was re-uploaded the next day (13 June), losing all its previous views. \"I Do\" was originally to be released on 31 July, but to the migrant crisis in Calais preventing a lorry containing copies of their single coming into the UK, it had to be delayed by a week, instead being released on 7 August. \"I Do\" debuted at number 53 on the UK Singles Chart on 14 August.\n\nOn 6 November 2015, Tajormani announced her departure from the band via her blog. Only The Young then announced their split four days later.\n\nOverload Generation (formerly Overload) were a five-piece boy band consisting of Ollie Garland (born 28 November 1994, 22, Bristol), Jordi Whitworth (born 27 March 1995, 22, Essex), Ryan Robertson (born 30 January 1996, 21 Essex), Joey Devries (born 10 August 1994, 22 Wales) and Andy Fowler (Previously in Only One Direction.

{"id": "37074140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37074140", "title": "Mechanics of Oscar Pistorius's running blades", "text": "Mechanics of Oscar Pistorius's running blades\n\nThe mechanics of the running blades used by South African Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius depend on special carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer prosthetics. Pistorius has double below-the-knee amputations and competes in both non-disabled and T44 amputee athletics events. Pistorius's eligibility to run in international non-disabled events is sanctioned by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\n\nPistorius began running in 2004 after a rugby knee injury which led to rehabilitation at the University of Pretoria's High Performance Centre with coach Ampie Louw. His first racing blades were fitted by South African prosthetist Francois Vanderwatt. Because he was unable to find suitable running blades in Pretoria, Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at Hanger Orthopedic Group. These quickly broke, and Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter Brian Frasure to be fitted for carbon-fibre blades by Icelandic company Össur.\n\nPistorius's participation in non-disabled international sprinting competitions in 2007 raised questions about his use of running blades, and the IAAF amended their rules to ban the use of \"any technical device that incorporates springs, wheels or any other element that provides a user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device.\" After initial studies, Pistorius was ruled ineligible for competitions under these IAAF rules. After further research was presented, the Court of Arbitration (CAS) ruled that his running prostheses were not shown to provide a net competitive advantage over biological legs. In 2012 Pistorius qualified for and competed in both the 2012 Olympic Games and the 2012 Paralympic Games using his running blades, becoming the first amputee sprinter to run in the Olympic Games.\n\nThe blades are transtibial prostheses, meaning they replace legs and feet that are amputated below the knee (BK). They were developed by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.\n\nCarbon fibre is actually a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used in a number of applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.\n\nPistorius has been using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear prosthetic legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.\n\nPistorius uses custom-made spike pads on the blades. Before development of the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.\n\nBecause of the curved design, the blades have to be slightly longer than a runner's biological leg and foot would be. The blades replace the hinge of an ankle with elastic compression that bends and releases the blade with every stride, so the uncompressed blade leaves the user standing on tiptoe. They are designed to move forward, so have no heel support in the back. According to Josh McHugh of Wired Magazine, \"The Cheetahs seem to bounce of their own accord. It’s impossible to stand still on them, and difficult to move slowly. Once they get going, Cheetahs are extremely hard to control.\"\n\nIn 2007 Pistorius applied to run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but questions quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue to run in non-disabled meets as long as he uses the equipment that was studied in the research.\n\nPistorius's performance in the early non-disabled races raised questions because of two major concerns: his pattern of running the races and his leg-swing times. Most sprinters spring out of the blocks with their fastest time and slow down as the race progresses, but Pistorius ran a \"negative split,\" starting slowly and building up speed in the last half of the race (though he no longer uses this pattern). His average time was also less in the 400m race when compared to other runners than in the 200m. Controversy about the use of the blades persists, but the research provided considerable information on how they work in application, and other research is expected to follow.\n\nNon-disabled sprinters have calves and ankles that return and amplify the energy supplied by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work because he does not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by \"Engineering & Technology\" magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.\n\nPistorius is always slow in starting a race because the flexible blades do not provide thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps his head down and takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may be able to use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.\n\nTo resolve questions about the blades, Pistorius was asked to take part in a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed. In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to \"Die Welt\" newspaper that Pistorius \"has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear.\" The study was published in 2008 in \"Sports Technology\", but later researchers stated that the analysis \"did not take enough variables into consideration\". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge. Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.\nIn 2008 a team of seven researchers conducted tests at Rice University, including Peter Weyand, Hugh Herr, Rodger Kram, Matthew Bundle and Alena Grabowski. The team collected metabolic and mechanical data by indirect calorimetry and ground reaction force measurements on Pistorius's performance during constant-speed, level treadmill running, and found that the energy usage was 3.8 percent lower than average values for elite non-disabled distance runners, 6.7 percent lower than for average distance runners and 17 percent lower than for non-disabled 400m sprint runners. At sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 m/s, Pistorius produced longer foot to ground contact times, shorter leg swing times, and lower average vertical forces than able bodied sprinters. The team concluded that running on the blades appears to be physiologically similar but mechanically different from running with biological legs. The study was published several months later in the \"Journal of Applied Physiology\". Kram also stated that Pistorius's \"rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes.\"\n\nThe lightness and rigidity of the blade compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that the study found that Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.\n\nIn 2008 a research team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades which was published in \"Biology Letters\". Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.\n\nDiscussion continues about the relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts also point out that the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.\n\nA controversy over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades within a few months before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.\n\nThe improvement in running time and the wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius's management issued a statement saying that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what prostheses he wears, and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.\n\n"}

He left his home in Macedonia at the age of 17 in search of wealth in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. In 1885, he returned to Macedonia, as part of a rebel squad of the revolutionary movement against the Ottoman Empire, led by Adam Kalmikov. He was captured and exiled to eastern Anatolia for a period of eight years, seven years of which were spent in the prison in Trabzon. In 1895, he again returned to Kruševo and became a member of IMARO. From this time on, he was fully committed to the independence of Macedonia from Turkish rule. Between 1897 and 1902 he was again in Sofia, where he also held an eating house. \nIn March 1903, he began commanding a revolutionary squad, crossing the Bulgarian-Ottoman border heading for Kruševo. From April to August 1903, he trained and prepared his irregulars for the upcoming Ilinden Uprising. He died in Krusevo, defending the Krusevo Republic.\n\nFollowing the revolt, Romania, with the support of Austro-Hungary, succeeded in the acceptance of Vlachs as a separate millet with the decree (irade) of May 22, 1905 by Sultan Abdulhamid, so the \"Ullah millet\" (the millet of the Vlachs) could have their own churches and schools Nevertheless, Pitu Guli and his family were Bulgarophiles. Except for \nExarchist Vlachs, most members of other ethnicities dismissed the IMRO as pro-Bulgarian. He is father of Tashko Gulev (Shula Guli), who died in 1913 as soldier of the Bulgarian army in the battle of Bregalnica against the Serbs, during the Second Balkan War. He is also father of the revolutionary of the IMRO, Nikola Gulev (Lakia Guli), one of the people closest to Todor Alexandrov. He was captured and killed by the Serbian police in 1924. Pitu Guli is a father of Steryo Gulev (Sterya Guli), who took part in the military units formed by the Bulgarian authorities in Vardar Macedonia during World War II to fight the communist Yugoslav partisans. He reportedly shot himself after Bulgarian withdrawal from Macedonia in 1944, upon the arrival of Tito's partisans in Kruševo, in despair over what he saw as a second period of Serbian dominance in Macedonia.\n\nPitu Guli is a national hero in the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and remembered as having fought heroically at Mečkin Kamen (\"Bear's Rock\") near Kruševo, where he was killed during the Ilinden Uprising in defense of the Macedonian Kruševo Republic. A Macedonian Partisan Brigade was named after him. He is also celebrated in folk songs and poetry throughout the region of Macedonia, being mentioned in the national anthem of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Today over Macedonia\").\n"}
{"id": "26071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26071", "title": "Robert M. Pirsig", "text": "Robert M. Pirsig\n\nRobert Maynard Pirsig (; September 6, 1928 – April 24, 2017) was an American writer and philosopher. He was the author of the philosophical novels \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values\" (1974) and \"\" (1991).\n\nPirsig was born on September 6, 1928, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Harriet Marie Sjobeck and Maynard Pirsig. He was of German and Swedish descent. His father was a University of Minnesota Law School (UMLS) graduate who started teaching at the school in 1934. The elder Pirsig served as the law school dean from 1948 to 1955, and retired from teaching at UMLS in 1970. He resumed his career as a professor at the William Mitchell College of Law, where he remained until his final retirement in 1993.\n\nA precocious child with an IQ of 170 at age nine, Pirsig skipped several grades and was enrolled at the Blake School in Minneapolis. At 14, in May 1943, Pirsig was awarded a high school diploma from the University of Minnesota's laboratory school, University High School (now Marshall-University High School) where he edited the school yearbook, the Bisbilla. He then entered the University of Minnesota to study biochemistry that autumn. In \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", he described the central character, thought to represent himself, as being far from a typical student; he was interested in science as a goal in itself, rather than as a way to establish a career.\n\nWhile doing laboratory work in biochemistry, Pirsig became greatly troubled by the existence of more than one workable hypothesis to explain a given phenomenon, and that the number of hypotheses appeared unlimited. He could not find any way to reduce the number of hypotheses—he became perplexed by the role and source of hypothesis generation within scientific practice. The question distracted him to the extent that he lost interest in his studies and failed to maintain good grades. Finally, he was expelled from the university.\n\nIn 1946, aged eighteen, Pirsig enlisted in the United States Army. He was stationed in South Korea until 1948. Upon his discharge from the Army, he returned to the United States and lived in Seattle, Washington, for less than a year, at which point he decided to finish the education he had abandoned. Pirsig earned a bachelor's degree in 1950 from the University of Minnesota. He then attended Banaras Hindu University in India, to study Eastern philosophy and culture. At the University of Chicago, he performed graduate-level work in philosophy and journalism but he did not obtain a degree there. In 1958 he earned a master's degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota.\n\nIn 1958, he became a professor at Montana State University in Bozeman, and taught creative writing courses for two years. Shortly thereafter he taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nPirsig's published writing consists most notably of two books. The better known, \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", develops around Pirsig's exploration into the nature of \"quality\". Ostensibly a first-person narrative based on a motorcycle trip he and his young son Chris had taken from Minneapolis to San Francisco, it is an exploration of the underlying metaphysics of Western culture. He also gives the reader a short summary of the history of philosophy, including his interpretation of the philosophy of Socrates as part of an ongoing dispute between \"universalists\", admitting the existence of \"universals\", and the Sophists, opposed by Socrates and his student Plato. Pirsig finds in \"Quality\" a special significance and common ground between Western and Eastern world views.\n\nPirsig had great difficulty finding a publisher for \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\". When he did, his publisher's internal recommendation stated, \"This book is brilliant beyond belief, it is probably a work of genius, and will, I'll wager, attain classic stature.\" In his book review, George Steiner compared Pirsig's writing to Dostoevsky, Broch, Proust, and Bergson, stating that \"the assertion itself is valid ... the analogies with \"Moby-Dick\" are patent\".\n\nIn 1974, Pirsig was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to allow him to write a follow-up, \"\" (1991), in which he developed a value-based metaphysics, Metaphysics of Quality, that challenges our subject–object view of reality. The second book, this time \"the captain\" of a sailboat, follows on from where \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\" left off.\n\nPirsig was vice-president of the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center from 1973 to 1975 and also served on the board of directors.\n\nRobert Pirsig married Nancy Ann James on May 10, 1954. They had two sons: Chris, born in 1956, and Theodore (Ted), born in 1958.\n\nPirsig suffered a mental breakdown and spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals between 1961 and 1963. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with electroconvulsive therapy on numerous occasions, a treatment he discusses in \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\". Nancy sought a divorce during this time; they formally separated in 1976 and divorced in 1978. On December 28, 1978, Pirsig married Wendy Kimball in Tremont, Maine.\n\nIn 1979, his son Chris, who figured prominently in \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", was fatally stabbed in a mugging outside the San Francisco Zen Center at the age of 22. Pirsig discusses this tragedy in an afterword to subsequent editions of \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", writing that he and his second wife Wendy Kimball decided not to abort the child they conceived in 1980 because he believed that this unborn child — later their daughter Nell — was a continuation of the \"life pattern\" that Chris had occupied.\n\nPirsig died aged 88, at his home in South Berwick, Maine, on April 24, 2017, after a period of failing health.\n\nPirsig received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1974 for General Nonfiction, and an Outstanding Achievement Award conferred by the University of Minnesota in 1975.\n\nOn December 15, 2012, Montana State University bestowed upon Pirsig an honorary doctorate in philosophy during the university's fall commencement. Pirsig was also honored with a commencement speech by MSU Regent Professor Michael Sexson. Pirsig had been an instructor in writing at what was then Montana State College from 1958–1960. In \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", Pirsig writes about his time at MSC as a less than pleasurable experience that this limited his ability to teach writing effectively, as well as to develop his own philosophies and literature. Due to frailty of health, Pirsig did not travel to Bozeman in December 2012 to accept the accolade.\n\n"}

{"id": "47717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47717", "title": "Srinivasa Ramanujan", "text": "Srinivasa Ramanujan\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan (; ; 22 December 188726 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: \"He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered\". Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing the extraordinary work sent to him as samples, Hardy arranged travel for Ramanujan to Cambridge. In his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that Hardy stated had \"defeated [him and his colleagues] completely\", in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results.\n\nDuring his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations). Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research. Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct. \"The Ramanujan Journal\", a peer-reviewed scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his notebooks – containing summaries of his published and unpublished results – have been analyzed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas. As late as 2011 and again in 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about \"simple properties\" and \"similar outputs\" for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death. He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was enough to show they could only have been written by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to other mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.\n\nIn 1919, ill health – now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis (a complication from episodes of dysentery many years previously) – compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. His last letters to Hardy, written January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems. His \"lost notebook\", containing discoveries from the last year of his life, caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976.\n\nA deeply religious Hindu, Ramanujan credited his substantial mathematical capacities to divinity, and stated that the mathematical knowledge he displayed was revealed to him by his family goddess. \"An equation for me has no meaning,\" he once said, \"unless it expresses a thought of God.\"\n\nRamanujan (literally, \"younger brother of Rama\", a Hindu deity) was born on 22 December 1887 into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu), at the residence of his maternal grandparents. His father, K. Srinivasa Iyengar, originally from Thanjavur district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop. His mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife and also sang at a local temple. They lived in a small traditional home on Sarangapani Sannidhi Street in the town of Kumbakonam. The family home is now a museum. When Ramanujan was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son, Sadagopan, who died less than three months later. In December 1889, Ramanujan contracted smallpox, though he recovered, unlike 4,000 others who would die in a bad year in the Thanjavur district around this time. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in Kanchipuram, near Madras (now Chennai). His mother gave birth to two more children, in 1891 and 1894, both failing to reach their first birthdays.\n\nOn 1 October 1892, Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school. After his maternal grandfather lost his job as a court official in Kanchipuram, Ramanujan and his mother moved back to Kumbakonam and he was enrolled in the Kangayan Primary School. When his paternal grandfather died, he was sent back to his maternal grandparents, then living in Madras. He did not like school in Madras, and tried to avoid attending. His family enlisted a local constable to make sure the boy attended school. Within six months, Ramanujan was back in Kumbakonam.\n\nSince Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of the boy as a child. He had a close relationship with her. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas. He learned to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits – all of which are part of Brahmin culture. At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.\n\nBy age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its approximately 35 teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the quartic. The following year, Ramanujan tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it could not be solved by radicals.\n\nIn 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of \"A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics\", G. S. Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems. Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book in detail. The book is generally acknowledged as a key element in awakening his genius. The next year, Ramanujan independently developed and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places. His peers at the time commented that they \"rarely understood him\" and \"stood in respectful awe\" of him.\n\nWhen he graduated from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum. He received a scholarship to study at Government Arts College, Kumbakonam, but was so intent on mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process. In August 1905, Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam, and stayed in Rajahmundry for about a month. He later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras. There he passed in mathematics, choosing only to attempt questions that appealed to him and leaving the rest unanswered, but performed poorly in other subjects, such as English, physiology and Sanskrit. Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam in December 1906 and again a year later. Without a FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.\n\nIt was in 1910, after a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society, V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, also known as Professor Ramaswami, that Ramanujan started to get recognition within the mathematics circles of Madras, subsequently leading to his inclusion as a researcher at the University of Madras.\n\nOn 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal) (21 March 1899 – 13 April 1994), a girl whom his mother had selected for him a year earlier and who was ten years old when they married. It was not unusual for marriages to be arranged with girls. She came from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur (Karur district) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony. As was common at that time, Janakiammal continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage till she attained puberty. In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in Madras.\n\nAfter the marriage, Ramanujan developed a hydrocele testis. The condition could be treated with a routine surgical operation that would release the blocked fluid in the scrotal sac, but his family did not have the money for the operation. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to do the surgery at no cost.\n\nAfter his successful surgery, Ramanujan searched for a job. He stayed at a friend's house while he went from door to door around Madras looking for a clerical position. To make money, he tutored students at Presidency College who were preparing for their F.A. exam.\n\nIn late 1910, Ramanujan was sick again. He feared for his health, and told his friend R. Radakrishna Iyer to \"hand [his notebooks] over to Professor Singaravelu Mudaliar [the mathematics professor at Pachaiyappa's College] or to the British professor Edward B. Ross, of the Madras Christian College.\" After Ramanujan recovered and retrieved his notebooks from Iyer, he took a train from Kumbakonam to Villupuram, a city under French control. In 1912, Ramanujan moved to a house in Saiva Muthaiah Mudali street, George Town, Madras with his wife and mother where they lived for a few months.\nIn May 1913, upon securing a research position at Madras University, Ramanujan moved with his family to Triplicane.\n\nRamanujan met deputy collector V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, who had founded the Indian Mathematical Society. Wishing for a job at the revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled:\n\nI was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no mind to smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue department.\n\nAiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras. Some of them looked at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the \"Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.\"\n\nOne of the first problems he posed in the journal was to find the value of:\n\nHe waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely nested radicals problem.\n\nUsing this equation, the answer to the question posed in the \"Journal\" was simply 3, obtained by setting , , and . Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the \"Journal\" on the properties of Bernoulli numbers. One property he discovered was that the denominators of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers were always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:\n\nIt will be observed that if \"n\" is even but not equal to zero,\n\nIn his 17-page paper, \"Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers\" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures. Ramanujan's writing initially had many flaws. As \"Journal\" editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted:\n\nMr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.\nRamanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the \"Journal\". In early 1912, he got a temporary job in the Madras Accountant General's office, with a salary of 20 rupees per month. He lasted only a few weeks. Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the Madras Port Trust.\n\nIn a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:\n\nSir,<br>\nI understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.\nAttached to his application was a recommendation from E. W. Middlemast, a mathematics professor at the Presidency College, who wrote that Ramanujan was \"a young man of quite exceptional capacity in Mathematics\". Three weeks after he had applied, on 1 March, Ramanujan learned that he had been accepted as a Class III, Grade IV accounting clerk, making 30 rupees per month. At his office, Ramanujan easily and quickly completed the work he was given, so he spent his spare time doing mathematical research. Ramanujan's boss, Sir Francis Spring, and S. Narayana Iyer, a colleague who was also treasurer of the Indian Mathematical Society, encouraged Ramanujan in his mathematical pursuits.\n\nIn the spring of 1913, Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and E. W. Middlemast tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. M. J. M. Hill of University College London commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes. He said that although Ramanujan had \"a taste for mathematics, and some ability,\" he lacked the educational background and foundation needed to be accepted by mathematicians. Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he did give thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.\n\nThe first two professors, H. F. Baker and E. W. Hobson, returned Ramanujan's papers without comment. On 16 January 1913, Ramanujan wrote to G. H. Hardy. Coming from an unknown mathematician, the nine pages of mathematics made Hardy initially view Ramanujan's manuscripts as a possible fraud. Hardy recognised some of Ramanujan's formulae but others \"seemed scarcely possible to believe\". One of the theorems Hardy found amazing was on the bottom of page three (valid for ):\n\nHardy was also impressed by some of Ramanujan's other work relating to infinite series:\n\nThe first result had already been determined by G. Bauer in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called hypergeometric series, which had first been researched by Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hardy found these results \"much more intriguing\" than Gauss's work on integrals. After seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before\". He figured that Ramanujan's theorems \"must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them\". Hardy asked a colleague, J. E. Littlewood, to take a look at the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were \"certainly the most remarkable I have received\" and said that Ramanujan was \"a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power\". One colleague, E. H. Neville, later remarked that \"not one [theorem] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world\".\n\nOn 8 February 1913, Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter expressing his interest in his work, adding that it was \"essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions\". Before his letter arrived in Madras during the third week of February, Hardy contacted the Indian Office to plan for Ramanujan's trip to Cambridge. Secretary Arthur Davies of the Advisory Committee for Indian Students met with Ramanujan to discuss the overseas trip. In accordance with his Brahmin upbringing, Ramanujan refused to leave his country to \"go to a foreign land\". Meanwhile, he sent Hardy a letter packed with theorems, writing, \"I have found a friend in you who views my labour sympathetically.\"\n\nTo supplement Hardy's endorsement, Gilbert Walker, a former mathematical lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging the young man to spend time at Cambridge. As a result of Walker's endorsement, B. Hanumantha Rao, a mathematics professor at an engineering college, invited Ramanujan's colleague Narayana Iyer to a meeting of the Board of Studies in Mathematics to discuss \"what we can do for S. Ramanujan\". The board agreed to grant Ramanujan a research scholarship of 75 rupees per month for the next two years at the University of Madras. While he was engaged as a research student, Ramanujan continued to submit papers to the \"Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.\" In one instance, Narayana Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, \"The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University.\" Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of Madras Christian College, whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, \"Does Ramanujan know Polish?\" The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail. In his quarterly papers, Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.\n\nHardy's correspondence with Ramanujan soured after Ramanujan refused to come to England. Hardy enlisted a colleague lecturing in Madras, E. H. Neville, to mentor and bring Ramanujan to England. Neville asked Ramanujan why he would not go to Cambridge. Ramanujan apparently had now accepted the proposal; as Neville put it, \"Ramanujan needed no converting and that his parents' opposition had been withdrawn\". Apparently, Ramanujan's mother had a vivid dream in which the family goddess, the deity of Namagiri, commanded her \"to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose\". Ramanujan traveled to England by ship, leaving his wife to stay with his parents in India.\n\nRamanujan departed from Madras aboard the S.S. \"Nevasa\" on 17 March 1914. When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville was waiting for him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks, Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room. Hardy and Littlewood began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs. Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, \"I can believe that he's at least a Jacobi\", while Hardy said he \"can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi.\"\n\nRamanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and published part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of mathematics had come into question and the need for mathematically rigorous proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration – a conflict that neither found easy.\n\nRamanujan was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on highly composite numbers, the first part of which was published as a paper in the \"Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.\" The paper was more than 50 pages and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy remarked that it was one of the most unusual papers seen in mathematical research at that time and that Ramanujan showed extraordinary ingenuity in handling it. On 6 December 1917, he was elected to the London Mathematical Society. In 1918 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, the second Indian admitted to the Royal Society, following Ardaseer Cursetjee in 1841. At age 31 Ramanujan was one of the youngest Fellows in the history of the Royal Society. He was elected \"for his investigation in Elliptic functions and the Theory of Numbers.\" On 13 October 1918, he was the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nThroughout his life, Ramanujan was plagued by health problems. His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion in England and wartime rationing during 1914–1918. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a severe vitamin deficiency at the time, and was confined to a sanatorium. In 1919 he returned to Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency, and soon thereafter, in 1920, died at the age of 32. After his death, his brother Tirunarayanan chronicled Ramanujan's remaining handwritten notes consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions and compiled them.\n\nRamanujan's widow, Smt. Janaki Ammal, moved to Bombay; in 1931 she returned to Madras and settled in Triplicane, where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950, she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the State Bank of India and raised a family. In her later years, she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and was also granted pensions from, among others, the Indian National Science Academy and the state governments of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts towards increasing his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, Bruce C. Berndt and Béla Bollobás made it a point to visit her while in India. She died at her Triplicane residence in 1994.\n\nA 1994 analysis of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptoms—including his past relapses, fevers, and hepatic conditions—were much closer to those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. At the time, if properly diagnosed, amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease; for instance, British soldiers who had contracted the disease during the First World War were being successfully cured of amoebiasis around the time Ramanujan left England.\n\nRamanujan has been described as a person of a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners. He lived a simple life at Cambridge. Ramanujan's first Indian biographers describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his family goddess, Mahalakshmi of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said he dreamed of blood drops that symbolised her consort, Narasimha. Afterward he would receive visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes. He often said, \"An equation for me has no meaning unless it represents a thought of God.\"\n\nHardy cites Ramanujan as remarking that all religions seemed equally true to him. Hardy further argued that Ramanujan's religious belief had been romanticised by Westerners and overstated—in reference to his belief, not practice—by Indian biographers. At the same time, he remarked on Ramanujan's strict vegetarianism.\n\nIn mathematics, there is a distinction between insight and formulating or working through a proof. Ramanujan proposed an abundance of formulae that could be investigated later in depth. G. H. Hardy said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more to them than initially meets the eye. As a byproduct of his work, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most interesting of these formulae include the intriguing infinite series for , one of which is given below:\n\nThis result is based on the negative fundamental discriminant with class number . Further, and and is related to the fact that\n\nThis might be compared to Heegner numbers, which have class number 1 and yield similar formulae.\n\nRamanujan's series for converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate . Truncating the sum to the first term also gives the approximation for , which is correct to six decimal places; truncating it to the first two terms gives a value correct to 14 decimal places. See also the more general Ramanujan–Sato series.\n\nOne of Ramanujan's remarkable capabilities was the rapid solution of problems, illustrated by the following anecdote about an incident in which P. C. Mahalanobis posed a problem:\n\nHis intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown identities, such as\n\nfor all , where is the gamma function, and related to a special value of the Dedekind eta function. Expanding into series of powers and equating coefficients of , , and gives some deep identities for the hyperbolic secant.\n\nIn 1918 Hardy and Ramanujan studied the partition function extensively. They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. Hans Rademacher, in 1937, was able to refine their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the circle method.\n\nIn the last year of his life, Ramanujan discovered mock theta functions. For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak Maass forms.\n\nAlthough there are numerous statements that could have borne the name \"Ramanujan conjecture,\" there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion on the size of the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(\"q\"), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.\n\nIn his paper \"On certain arithmetical functions\", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function whose coefficients are called (the Ramanujan tau function). He proved many congruences for these numbers such as for primes . This congruence (and others like it that Ramanujan proved) inspired Jean-Pierre Serre (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture that there is a theory of Galois representations which \"explains\" these congruences and more generally all modular forms. is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Pierre Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem proceeds by first reinterpreting elliptic curves and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations. Without this theory there would be no proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\nWhile still in Madras, Ramanujan recorded the bulk of his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.\n\nThis may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on slate, and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the Madras Presidency at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of G. S. Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.\n\nThe first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second notebook has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, with the third notebook containing 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself created papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did G. N. Watson, B. M. Wilson, and Bruce Berndt. A fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called \"lost notebook\", was rediscovered in 1976 by George Andrews.\n\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy–Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital. In Hardy's words:\n\nI remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. \"No\", he replied, \"it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.\"\n\nImmediately before this anecdote, Hardy quoted Littlewood as saying, \"Every positive integer was one of [Ramanujan's] personal friends.\"\n\nThe two different ways are:\n\nGeneralizations of this idea have created the notion of \"taxicab numbers\".\n\nIn his obituary of Ramanujan, which he wrote for \"Nature\" in 1920, Hardy observed Ramanujan's work primarily involved fields less known even amongst other pure mathematicians, concluding:\n\nHardy further said:\n\nWhen asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were \"arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account.\" He also stated that he had \"never met his equal, and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi.\"\n\nK. Srinivasa Rao has said, \"As for his place in the world of Mathematics, we quote Bruce C. Berndt: 'Paul Erdős has passed on to us Hardy's personal ratings of mathematicians. Suppose that we rate mathematicians on the basis of pure talent on a scale from 0 to 100, Hardy gave himself a score of 25, J. E. Littlewood 30, David Hilbert 80 and Ramanujan 100.'\" During a lecture at IIT Madras in May 2011, Berndt stated that over the last 40 years, as nearly all of Ramanujan's theorems have been proven right, there had been greater appreciation of Ramanujan's work and brilliance, and that Ramanujan's work was now pervading many areas of modern mathematics and physics.\n\nIn his book \"Scientific Edge\", the physicist Jayant Narlikar spoke of \"Srinivasa Ramanujan, discovered by the Cambridge mathematician Hardy, whose great mathematical findings were beginning to be appreciated from 1915 to 1919. His achievements were to be fully understood much later, well after his untimely death in 1920. For example, his work on the highly composite numbers (numbers with a large number of factors) started a whole new line of investigations in the theory of such numbers.\"\n\nThe year after his death, \"Nature\" listed Ramanujan among other distinguished scientists and mathematicians on a \"Calendar of Scientific Pioneers,\" who had achieved eminence. Ramanujan's home state of Tamil Nadu celebrates 22 December (Ramanujan's birthday) as 'State IT Day'. A stamp picturing Ramanujan was released by the Government of India in 1962 – the 75th anniversary of Ramanujan's birth – commemorating his achievements in the field of number theory, and a new design was issued on 26 December 2011, by the India Post.\n\nSince Ramanujan's centennial year, his birthday, 22 December, has been annually celebrated as Ramanujan Day by the Government Arts College, Kumbakonam where he studied and at the IIT Madras in Chennai. A prize for young mathematicians from developing countries has been created in Ramanujan's name by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in cooperation with the International Mathematical Union, which nominate members of the prize committee. The SASTRA University, based in the state of Tamil Nadu in South India, has instituted the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize of US$10,000 to be given annually to a mathematician not exceeding the age of 32 for outstanding contributions in an area of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan. Based on the recommendations of a high level committee appointed by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Government of India, Srinivasa Ramanujan Centre, established by SASTRA, has been declared as an OFF-CAMPUS CENTRE under the ambit of SASTRA University. House of Ramanujan Mathematics, a museum on life and works of the Mathematical prodigy, Srinivasa Ramanujan, also exists on this campus. SASTRA purchased the house where Srinivasa Ramanujan lived at Kumabakonam and renovated it. Vasavi College of Engineering named its Department of Computer Science and Information Technology \"Ramanujan Block\".\n\nIn 2011, on the 125th anniversary of his birth, the Indian Government declared that 22 December will be celebrated every year as \"National Mathematics Day\". Then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also declared that the year 2012 would be celebrated as the National Mathematics Year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3442045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3442045", "title": "Susan Bordo", "text": "Susan Bordo\n\nSusan Bordo is a writer known for her contributions to the field of contemporary cultural studies, particularly in the area of \"body studies\".\n\nBordo's writing contributes to a body of feminist, cultural and gender studies, linking modern consumer culture directly to the formation of gendered bodies. She is known for her \"Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body\" (1993), a text that looks at the impact of popular culture (television, advertisements, and magazines, for example) in shaping the female body while also looking at typical female disorders such as hysteria, agoraphobia, anorexia nervosa and bulimia as \"complex crystallizations of culture\". Bordo has also garnered attention for her more recent \"The Male Body: A New Look at Men in Public and Private\" (1999), a text which Bordo describes as being \"a personal/cultural exploration of the male body from a woman's point of view.\"\n\nBordo received her Ph.D. from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1982. She currently holds the Otis A. Singletary Chair in the Humanities at the University of Kentucky where she teaches English and Women's studies. Bordo specializes in contemporary culture and its relation to the body, focusing on modern female disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, cosmetic surgery, beauty and evolutionary theory. She also deals with racism and the body, issues of masculinity along with issues of sexual harassment.\n\nWhile Bordo's writing works to \"reach outside the academic world\", her theoretical prose and frank critiques of modern culture in relation to subject, gender and body formations are nonetheless grounded in theoretical frameworks. Bordo's work reflects a background in philosophical discourse in which issues of rationality, objectivity and Cartesian dualism are taken up, explored and used to situate the body within culture historically. Bordo claims that \"[w]hat remains the constant element throughout historical variation is the construction of body as something apart from the true self (whether conceived as soul, mind, spirit, will, creativity, freedom . . .) and as undermining the best efforts of that self\". She traces the \"body\" as a concept and as a material \"thing\" back to Plato, Augustine and the Bible revealing how traditionally the body has been viewed as \"animal, as appetite, as deceiver, as prisoner of the soul and confounder of its projects\". She also traces the dualistic nature of the mind/body connection by examining the early philosophies of Aristotle, Hegel and Descartes, revealing how such distinguishing such as spirit/matter and male activity/female passivity have worked to solidify gender characteristics and categorization. Bordo goes on to point out that while men have historically been associated with the intellect and the mind or spirit, women have long been associated with the body, the subordinated, negatively imbued term in the mind/body dichotomy.\n\nBordo argues that \"knowledge is 'embodied,' produced from a 'standpoint,' by a body that is located as a material entity among other material entities\". She is therefore situated within a materialist framework, for, as Susan Hekman points out, \"Bordo's emphasis on the materiality of the body, what most of us would call the 'real' body, is a function of her central theoretical conviction\". Situating Bordo within a feminist and materialist theoretical context, her work is often compared and contrasted with Judith Butler's writing, writing that deals with gender formation and the body. Hekman provides analyses of Bordo's situatedness within materialist discourse and suggests both differences and similarities in the theoretical concerns of Bordo and Butler. While Bordo does at times imply that the body is a text to be inscribed upon and interpreted, she also emphasizes the materiality and locatedness of bodies within Western culture, whereas Butler's work on the body reflects a greater affiliation with postmodern thought in \"treat[ing] the body as pure text\". Bordo questions such a purely textual body for \"If the body is treated as pure text, subversive, destabilizing elements can be emphasized and freedom and self-determination celebrated; but one is left wondering, is there a body in this text?\". For Bordo, it is the \"cultural definitions of the \"body\" and its materiality as they are given to us\" that must be resisted, and therefore \"real\" bodies \"must be the focus of feminist analysis and, significantly, feminist resistance\".\n\nBordo's critique of gendered, and particularly feminine, bodies stems from both feminist and gender studies methodologies. She critiques, re-evaluates, and reconfigures old and new feminist methodology, not excluding certain earlier feminist concerns that focused on the dichotomies of oppressor/oppressed, victimizer/victim, but re-evaluating their effectiveness and application to contemporary feminine concerns. As Bordo points out, feminism of the late 1960s and 1970s viewed \"the female body [as] a socially shaped and historically 'colonized' territory\". Such a view, she claims, classifies women and the female body predominantly as victims, living passively/submissively within patriarchal society, a tabula rasa awaiting inscription. Intending to go beyond such a classification, Bordo writes that new feminist critiques looked more towards \"racial, economic and class differences among women,\" while also looking at \"both women's collusions with patriarchal culture and their frequent efforts at resistance\".\n\nWhile situated within feminist and gender studies frameworks, Bordo's theories also stem from a cultural studies approach where the power of cultural phenomena such as television, advertising and popular magazines are analyzed in terms of means of domination and of resistance. While certain cultural theorists, for example John Fiske, who wrote \"Television Culture\" (1990), see elements of culture like television as \"demonstrating the way representational codes and techniques shape our perception\" but also as a means for resistance, where audience members could \"decode\" such messages and thus be able to \"think resistantly about their lives\", Bordo sees cultural coding as a more pernicious, binding and overwhelming force. For Bordo \"the rules of femininity have come to be culturally transmitted more and more through the deployment of standardized visual images\"; cultural transmitters such as television and print media work insidiously to \"impose models of bodily beauty that get construed as freely chosen options by those victimized by them\".\n\nThe notions of culture, power and gender/subject formation that dominate Bordo's writing arise in some degree from poststructuralist thought. Susan Hekman points out that \"[l]ike an increasing number of contemporary feminist theorists [Bordo] argues for a selective use of postmodern theories\" and one way Bordo's work can be seen in a poststructuralist/postmodernist light is through her usage of Foucauldian methodology. Bordo appropriates the ideas of Michel Foucault in critiquing, analyzing and bringing to light \"the normative feminine practices of our culture\". As Bordo points out, Foucault saw power not \"as the \"possession\" of individuals or groups\" but \"as a dynamic or network of non-centralized forces\", and such a depiction of power relations is therefore useful in a critique of gender formation/regulation. If, in a Foucauldian sense, power works from below, then \"prevailing forms of selfhood and subjectivity (gender among them) are maintained, not chiefly through physical restraint and coercion (although social relations may certainly contain such elements), but through individual self-surveillance and self-correction to norms\". Foucault's theories of power and discipline along with theories on sexuality serve contemporary feminist aims in revealing how cultural normative practices, expressed through popular media, work to influence femininity (and gendered bodies in general) into homogeneity while at the same time seeming freely chosen. \"Like Foucault, [Bordo] focuses on the discourses through which society produces, understands, defines, and interprets the female body.\"\n\n\"The Flight to Objectivity\" represents what Bordo refers to as a \"fresh approach\" to Descartes' \"Meditations\". She critiques the stable notion of objectivity and knowledge inherent in Cartesian thought, notions that, in our contemporary society, have become critically distanced, for \"[t]he limitations of science and the interested, even ideological nature of all human pursuits now seem unavoidable recognitions\". Bordo sees that, rather than viewing Descartes from a \"coherent abstract or ahistorical\" perspective, we need to approach Descartes' philosophical arguments within \"the context of the cultural pressures that gave rise to them\". Susan Hekman notes that Bordo's \"The Flight to Objectivity\", while not overtly dealing with theorizations of the body, does point to the fact that \"the origin of our culture's text for the body, and particularly the female body, is the work of Descartes\". The Cartesian division of the mind and the body, where the body is the \"prison that the mind must escape to achieve knowledge\", guides Bordo's further analyses of culturally influenced bodies and the shaping of the female body in particular.\n\nBordo's \"Unbearable Weight\" presents a collection of essays that focus on the body's situatedness and construction in Western Society and offers \"a cultural approach to the body\". Bordo looks at \"obsessive body practices of contemporary culture\" and claims that her aim \"is not to portray these obsessions as bizarre or anomalous, but, rather, as the logical (if extreme) manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture\". Practices such as cosmetic surgery, obsessive dieting and physical training represent, for Bordo, how cultural \"representations homogenize\" and how \"these homogenized images normalize\". \"Unbearable Weight\" also traces the connection between culture and female disorders and Bordo emphasizes the fact that disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia cannot simply be defined from medical and psychological standpoints but must be viewed from within a cultural context, as \"complex crystallizations of culture\". It is through such female disorders that resistance to dominant ideological constructs are seemingly played out; however, such a resistance reveals the devastating effects of culture on the contemporary female body. In 2003, the tenth anniversary reissue edition of \"Unbearable Weight\" was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize after its original release date. In the reissue of the book, Bordo considers the cultural images of the female body within the framework of the patriarchy, contemporary feminism, and postindustrial capitalism. \n\n\"Twilight Zones\" represents Bordo's continued preoccupation and study of cultural images and their saturation within contemporary culture. She utilizes Plato's parable of the cave, where images are projected onto the back of the cave presenting the illusion of a reality its inhabitants identify with and accept as real, claiming that such a metaphor depicts a particular contemporary concern. She writes that \"[f]or us, bedazzlement by created images is no metaphor; it is the actual condition of our lives\". Bordo alludes to constructed images of bodily perfection in contemporary consumer culture such as the portrayal of reconstructed physical bodies in magazines and advertisements as presenting false ideals for the viewers who identify with such images and use them as standards for their own bodies and lives. She writes that \"we need to rehabilitate the concept of \"truth\" for our time . . . focusing on helping the next generation learn to critically see through the illusions and mystifications of the image dominated culture they have grown up in\". \"Twilight Zones\" also takes up, in various essays, the connection and conversation between academic and non-academic institutions, for while not anti-academic herself, Bordo sees academic and intellectual thought as proclaiming itself \"'outside' the cave of cultural mystification,\" as raised up onto \"a loftier perch, scrutinizing the proceedings below\". Bordo wants to \"bring theory down to earth\".\n\nWith \"The Male Body\" Bordo shifts her focus from looking specifically at female and feminized bodies to looking at the male body from a female perspective. She includes analyses of the male body that take into consideration the representation of the male body in popular cultural modes of communication such as movies, advertisements and literature, revealing how anxieties over bodily form and beauty are not limited to women but are of concern for men also. She also analyzes attitudes surrounding the penis and gay culture in the twentieth century.\n\nIn \"The Creation of Anne Boleyn,\" Bordo seeks to break down the “sedimented mythology turned into ‘history’ by decades of repetition” and rewrite Boleyn's story as an ambitious woman seeking power without the cache of distorted imagery around her appearance.\n\nBordo examines why \"… the most qualified candidate ever to run for president lost the seemingly unloseable election.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12707330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12707330", "title": "Vedius Pollio", "text": "Vedius Pollio\n\nPublius Vedius Pollio (died 15 BC) was a Roman of equestrian rank, and a friend of the Roman emperor Augustus, who appointed him to a position of authority in the province of Asia. In later life he became known for his luxurious tastes and cruelty to his slaves – when they displeased him, he had them fed to lampreys that he maintained for that purpose, which was deemed to be an exceedingly cruel act. When Vedius tried to apply this method of execution to a slave who broke a crystal cup, Emperor Augustus (Pollio's guest at the time) was so appalled that he not only intervened to prevent the execution but had all of Pollio's valuable drinking vessels deliberately broken. This incident, and Augustus's demolition of Vedius's mansion in Rome he inherited in his will, were frequently referred to in antiquity in discussions of ethics and of the public role of Augustus.\n\nPublius Vedius Pollio, the son of a freedman, was born in the 1st century BC and attained membership of the equestrian order.\n\nVedius Pollio's first certain appearance in historical sources comes after Octavian (later Augustus) became sole ruler of the Roman world in 31 BC; at some point Vedius held authority in the province of Asia on behalf of the emperor. For a mere equestrian to govern this province was anomalous, and there were presumably special circumstances; Vedius' term of office could have been in 31–30 BC before the appointment of a regular proconsular governor, or after a major earthquake in 27 BC. He later returned to Rome, and when Alexander and Aristobulus, the sons of Herod the Great, came to the city in about 22 BC, they may have stayed with him.\n\nDespite these services to the state, it was for his reputed luxury and cruelty that Vedius would become best known. He owned a massive villa at Posillipo on the Gulf of Naples, later described by the poet Ovid as \"like a city\". Most notoriously, he kept a pool of lampreys into which slaves who incurred his displeasure would be thrown as food – a particularly unpleasant means of death, since the lamprey \"clamps its mouth on the\nvictim and bores a dentated tongue into the flesh to ingest blood\".\n\nNevertheless, he retained, at least for a while, the friendship of Augustus, in whose honour he built a shrine or monument at Beneventum. On one occasion, Augustus was dining at Vedius' home when a cup-bearer broke a crystal glass. Vedius ordered him thrown to the lampreys, but the slave fell to his knees before Augustus and pleaded to be executed in some more humane way. Horrified, the emperor had all of Vedius's expensive glasses smashed and the pool filled in. According to Seneca, Augustus also had the slave freed; Dio merely remarks that Vedius \"could not punish his servant for what Augustus also had done\".\n\nThere are a number of less certain appearances that may be the same Vedius Pollio. A Vidius or Vedius, possibly the same, is mentioned in a letter of 46 BC as involved in a dispute with the scholar-politician Curtius Nicias. As well, Ronald Syme suggests that the \"Publius Vedius\" who appears in Cicero's letters as a friend of Pompey may also be Vedius Pollio. Cicero, governor of Cilicia, was travelling near Laodicea in 50 BC, when Publius Vedius met him with a large retinue, and several wild asses and a baboon in a chariot. Unimpressed, Cicero wrote to Atticus, \"I never saw a more worthless man.\" About this possible Vedius Pollio, Cicero adds a further anecdote: Publius Vedius, earlier, had left some items with Vindulus, who meanwhile had died. Vindulus's heir later examined the items and found five portrait-busts of married ladies, including the noted patrician Junia Secunda. Cicero took these to be trophies of Vedius' sexual conquests, and, while highly praising her publicly, in correspondence, criticizing her for the indiscretion, and her husband and brother for their lack of awareness of her conduct. (At the same time, an affair, if it did occur, may have been with a sister Junia Prima.\n\nVedius died in 15 BC. Among his many heirs, Augustus received a large part of Vedius's estate, including his villa at Posillipo, along with instructions to erect a suitable monument on the site. The emperor demolished at least part of Pollio's house in Rome and constructed in its place a colonnade, the \"Porticus of Livia\" in honour of his wife, which he dedicated in 7 BC.\n\nVedius's treatment of his slaves and Augustus's conduct towards him became popular subjects for anecdotes in antiquity. During or shortly after Augustus's reign, Ovid praised his demolition of Vedius's house as a grand statement against immoral luxury made even at the emperor's own cost. Scott notes that in replacing the house with a public monument Augustus merely \"carried out the terms of the will\", and argues that any suggestion he wished to censure Vedius's memory may have been mere \"gossip\".\n\nAlso in the 1st century AD, Vedius's story was used by the philosopher Seneca the Younger and the encyclopedist Pliny the Elder. In two ethical treatises, Seneca used Vedius's treatment of the cup-bearer and Augustus's response to illustrate the extremes to which anger could lead and the need for clemency. Pliny the Elder mentioned Vedius's lampreys in his \"Natural History\" while treating varieties of fish, noting the man's friendship with Augustus while ignoring the story of the latter's clemency. Pliny was no admirer of Augustus and his handling of the story has been seen as \"a gratuitous jibe\" at the emperor. In a highly rhetorical passage, the Christian writer Tertullian stated that after executing slaves, Vedius had his lampreys \"cooked straight away, so that in their entrails he himself might have a taste of his slaves' bodies too\".\n\nIn several works, Adam Smith cited Augustus's intervention to save the cup-bearer in support of an argument that the condition of slaves was better under a monarchy than a democracy. He embellished the story by claiming that Augustus manumitted all of Vedius's slaves, a statement not based on any ancient source, in one 1763 lecture even estimating the value of the property their master thus lost.\n\n"}
{"id": "49960420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49960420", "title": "Vela Blagoeva", "text": "Vela Blagoeva\n\nVela Blagoeva () (1859–1921) was a Bulgarian writer, journalist and teacher and is noted as one of the founders of the women's movement in Bulgaria. After completing a basic education in the Ottoman Empire, she taught until she received a scholarship to further her education in Russia. While taking courses in the Russian normal school and pedagogy training courses, she became a socialist. Returning to Bulgaria, she taught school and wrote editorials for a wide number of publications. In 1901, she joined with a group of feminists to found the Bulgarian Women's Union. Two years later, she organized the first Socialist women's organization and conference held in Bulgaria.\n\nVictoria Atanasova Zhivkova was born on 29 September 1859 in Tarnovo, in Ottoman Bulgaria to Neda Spiridonova and Atanas Zhivkov. She was the youngest of five children, including sisters, Mariola and Rose, and brothers, who was a politician and served three times as head of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, and Nikola Zhivkov, founder of the first kindergarten in Bulgaria and poet who wrote the lyrics of the national anthem, Shumi Maritsa. Their father died while the children were young and her older brothers took responsibility for raising the family. She finished the middle school for girls in Tarnovo and went to high school in Gabrovo, graduating from the Gabrovo Girls' School in 1871. She became a teacher and taught in Berkovitsa, Istanbul, Tarnovo and Varna. In 1874, Zhivkova and her brother Nikola used their summer holiday to collect monies to build a girls' school and church in Varna. During the Russo-Turkish War, she served as a nurse at the 50th field hospital in Svishtov. When the war ended in 1878, Zhivkova obtained a scholarship from the Slavic Charity Committee of St. Petersburg and began attending pedagogical courses at the Mariinsky high school for girls, graduating in 1881. She returned to Bulgaria and taught in Edirne and later in Bitolia. Returning to Russia, between 1882 and 1884, she studied in St. Petersburg taking the Bestuzhev Courses to earn a teaching degree. While in Russia, she was influenced by the student protests against the tsarist autocracy and met St. Petersburg University student Dimitar Blagoev, whom she married.\n\nBlagoeva returned to Sofia in 1884 and began teaching at the Sofia Exemplary Girls' School. In July 1885, she established with Dimitar the first socialist journal in Bulgaria, \"Modern Trends\" () which they co-edited. She wrote articles about discrimination against teachers, equality and women's education. For the duration of the Serbo-Bulgarian War she volunteered as a nurse at Slivnitsa and Pirot. Because of her outspoken political ideology and support for Socialism, Blagoevna was repeatedly transferred or dismissed from teaching posts. Between 1884 and 1912, she taught in a succession of schools in Sofia (1884–1885), Shumen (1886–1887), Vidin (1897–1890), Veliko Tarnovo (1890–1892), Stara Zagora (1892–1893), Plovdiv (1893–1896), Tulcha (1901–1902), Plovdiv (1902–1903), Sofia (1905–1907) and Marashki Trustenik (1907–1912). In 1912, she had health issues and though she retired from teaching, she continued with other endeavors.\n\nIn 1894, Blagoeva began the magazine \"Case\" () which was founded to disseminate socialist literary works of Bulgarian authors. She featured the poems by , (1876-1953) and Ivan St. Andreychin (1872-1934), and prose from Anton Strashimirov. She edited the journal until 1896, when she was forced to suspend publication, primarily because of her husband's activities. In 1901, she was a co-founder of the first national women’s organization, Bulgarian Women's Union () (BZhS) along with Dimitrana Ivanova, Ekaterina Karavelova, Anna Karima, Kina Konova, Julia Malinova, and others. Two years later Blagoeva led the faction that split from the BZhS for ideological differences. She believed that the BzhS had become too focused on upper class women's issues alone and was not focused on the worker's needs. She founded a journal called \"Women's Labor\" () where she began advocating for worker's rights.\n\nIn 1905, Blagoeva founded the first educational group for women workers which focused on a socialist message and by August of that year had organized a conference for socialist women in Sofia. These actions drew criticism, including from her husband, on the basis that male colleagues believed that women should remain part of the united workers movement. While she remained against attempts to unite all women under one umbrella organization, Blagoeva argued with male colleagues that women had the right to make their own decisions. While all of her writings were devoted to socialism, she wrote about women’s emancipation from the societal strictures of patriarchy and subordination and urged women's independence, equal education, paid labor, access to education and the abolition of punishment for prostitution. She published widely in newspapers and journals including \"Bulgarian collection\" (), \"Day\" (), \"Democratic review\" (), \"Firefly\" (), \"Just Deed\" (), \"New Times\" (), \"Red laughter\" (), \"School review\" () and \"Teacher\" () and edited Deed (), Women’s Bulletin (). Often her earnings, due to her husband's unemployment for his dissidence, were the sole support of their family.\n\nBlagoeva and Dimitar had four children: Stela (1887-1954) Natalia (1889-1943), Vladimir (1893-1925) and Dimitur (1895-1918). Dimitur was killed during World War I. Blagoeva died in Sofia on 21 July 1921. Posthumously, a school in her hometown was named in her honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "985609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=985609", "title": "Vortimer", "text": "Vortimer\n\nVortimer (Old Welsh Guorthemir, ), also known as Saint Vortimer (,  \"Vortimer the Blessed\"), is a figure in British tradition, a son of the 5th-century Britonnic ruler Vortigern. He is remembered for his fierce opposition to his father's Saxon allies. In Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", he overthrows his father and reigns as King of Britain for a brief period before his death restores Vortigern to power.\n\nVortimer first appears in the 9th-century work known as the \"Historia Brittonum\". According to the \"Historia\", Vortigern allows Saxons under Hengest and Horsa to settle on the Isle of Thanet, and offers them provisions in exchange for their service as mercenaries. Vortigern soon proves to be an \"ignorant king\", and the wily Hengest manipulates him into ceding over more land and allowing more settlers to come from Germania. After a dire period of Saxon encroachment, exacerbated by even more disgraceful behavior on Vortigern's part, Vortimer finally rises up against the Saxons. He pushes them back to Thanet, and meets them in four battles. At the third battle Horsa and Vortimer's brother Catigern are slain; at the fourth the Saxons are pushed back to sea. Shortly thereafter, however, Vortimer dies. He asks his followers to bury him at the place where the Saxons first landed in Britain as a totem against further invasion. However, his followers fail to heed his warning and the Saxons return. According to the Welsh Triads his bones were buried \"in the Chief Ports of this Island\".\n\nThree of Vortimer's battle sites are named, and appear to have some correspondence with battles in Kent appearing in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". The \"Chronicle\" does not name Vortimer, and in fact credit Vortigern as the British leader in one of the battles. \n\nThe legendary material in the Historia Brittonum was slightly expanded upon in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia regum Britanniae\", a fictional account of the rulers of Britain. There the Britons abandon Vortigern and elevate Vortimer to be king of Britain. After he has driven out the Saxons, Vortimer is poisoned by his stepmother Rowena (a Saxon) and Vortigern regains the crown.\n"}

He first appeared in \"Superman\" #167 (February 1964), and was created by Edmond Hamilton, Cary Bates, and Curt Swan.\n\nHe is the heir of Brainiac, one of Superman's greatest foes. He is an ancestor of Querl Dox, Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Vril Dox first appeared in \"Superman\" #167 (February 1964), by Edmond Hamilton, Cary Bates, and Curt Swan, in a story entitled \"The Deadly Duo! - The Team of Luthor and Brainiac!\". He was later resurrected in \"Invasion!\" #1 (January 1989), by Keith Giffen, Bill Mantlo, and Todd McFarlane. However, rather than being the adopted son of Brainiac, due to changes in Post-\"Crisis\" continuity, he is now a clone of Brainiac.\n\nHe went on to star in \"L.E.G.I.O.N. '89\" (February 1989) through \"L.E.G.I.O.N. '94\" (September 1994) by Keith Giffen, Alan Grant, and Barry Kitson. He returned in the follow-up series \"R.E.B.E.L.S. '94\" (October 1994) through \"R.E.B.E.L.S. '96\" (March 1996) by Tom Peyer and Arnie Jorgensen, and the subsequent series \"R.E.B.E.L.S.\" (2009-2011).\n\nVril Dox was a young Coluan who was adopted by the Computer Tyrants of Colu and declared Brainiac's son (Brainiac 2). He escaped and led a rebellion against the Computer Tyrants which overthrew their rule. He later appeared briefly in the \"Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes\" miniseries. His descendants (who had inherited long Coluan lifespans) were his son Pran Dox (Brainiac 3), his grandson Kajz Dox (Brainiac 4) and ultimately his great-grandson Querl Dox, Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super Heroes.\n\nVril Dox II is a now a clone of Vril Dox (Brainiac), rather than his adopted son, as he is created by Vril Dox himself. He is still regarded as Brainiac's \"heir\", as he has inherited the original's high intelligence and Machiavellian ethics.\n\nVril Dox is the founder of the interplanetary police force Licensed Extra Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network (abbreviated as L.E.G.I.O.N., an acronym suggested by Strata but accepted by Dox). It was founded through outright murder when Vril and his allies destroyed a criminal drug ring. Chief Dox tries to manipulate everyone he came across, not generally accepting when they did not follow his plans. He manages to gain control of the bounty hunter Lobo. This is partly by outsmarting and outfighting Lobo and taking advantage of one of the bounty hunter's simple ethics; that he never breaks his word.\n\nVril leads the Earth's heroes in the 1992 \"Annual\" crossover, they travel to the moon and defeat the Eclipso entity.\n\nVril had a son named Lyrl Dox (Brainiac 3) who rebelled and took over his organization. Vril later regains control of L.E.G.I.O.N by bartering with the demon Neron. The deal is for the soul of one of his unborn offspring. After the cancellation of the title, he would only occasionally appear in the more cosmic DCU titles. For example, he appears in the 2004 Adam Strange miniseries, using robotic soldiers to hunt Strange. Dox, now missing his hair, incorrectly believes Rann had been destroyed at the hands of Strange. Dox's forces assist in the limited series \"Infinite Crisis\".\n\nA new 2009 series features Starro the Conqueror taking control of a now completely automated L.E.G.I.O.N. Dox, along with his old compatriot, Strata, must form a new team to regain his former status. During the \"Blackest Night\" crossover, Dox comes into contact with the mother of his son, who had recently been killed by L.E.G.I.O.N. drones, and was subsequently revived as a Black Lantern. Dox was also in an area in which a Sinestro Corps member was murdered by another Black Lantern. When the ring started to search for a new host, it selected Dox, making him a member of the Sinestro Corps. However, not even the power of the ring was a match for the Black Lanterns, forcing Dox to teleport them to Starro's homeworld, despite the fact that his son, Lyrl (who had recently had his intelligence restored by the warlord) was there also. Soon after, the ring rejected Dox, who had repeatedly refused Sinestro's mandate that all members of the Sinestro Corps were to gather at Korugar, and declared that he had been discharged from the Corps.\n\nR.E.B.E.L.S. helped to save the Vega system and several galaxies by defeating Starro the Conqueror. The plight of Rann's people was soon resolved by Vril Dox, seeking to restore his reputation after Starro the Conqueror stole L.E.G.I.O.N. from him and used it to enslave its client worlds. Dox Zeta-beamed Rann into the Vega system, in the orbit previously held by the now destroyed planet Tamaran, and proceeded to terraform Rann and make it suitable to sustain life again.\n\nThe restoration of the planet Rann was not Dox's only reason for relocating it into the Vega system. First, by putting Rann into Tamaran's orbit, it restored the gravitional balance to the Vega system, which had been thrown off by Tamaran's destruction. Secondly, in exchange for restoring their planet, the people of Rann agreed to let Dox rebuild L.E.G.I.O.N. headquarters on Rann.\n\nTamaranian refugees, led by Blackfire, attacked Rann believing that since the planet was in Tamaran's orbit they had claim to it. The violence was ended when Vril Dox, who was off-world at the start of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the fighting without bloodshed on either side. As it turned out, Dox was off-world negotiating an official end to the Rann-Thanagar War, using Rann's new-found distance from Thanagar and change in leadership on both sides as leverage.\n\nDox then went on to mediate the tension between the Rannians and the Tamaranians by proposing that the Tamaranians live on Rann's uninhabited southern continent.\n\nDox, Adam Strange and other senior commanders of L.E.G.I.O.N. also ensured peace with the Green Lantern Corps and helped create an alliance between Rannians, Tamaranians and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro the Conqueror, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega system and the galaxy, with Dox becoming consort to Blackfire.\n\nIn \"Superman Annual\" Vol. 3 #2 Vril Dox is shown to be Brainiac's original identity.\n\nWhen Brainiac's home planet of Colu falls under the threat of four beings that escaped the Source Wall at the end of \"Dark Nights: Metal\", the teams of heroes and villains realize that their armor is pulling them into four teams towards four different energy sources in the form of trees that coincide with the four entities. Batman's team finds Vril Dox, who claims that his father would never put his faith in the Earth heroes, as he only needed their powers to save Colu, but his plan required him at every step. With Brainiac's death at the hands of Amanda Waller, the planet of Colu and Earth are doomed.\n\nVril is visited by the time-traveling entity named Waverider, a man on a mission to see which modern-day heroic figure might become a tyrant in ten years' time. This is part of the \"Armageddon 2001\" crossover. Vril captures Waverider and does see his future. Due to power gained by ten years of Waverider's capture, Vril has become a tyrant, killing many innocents. Horrified at this, Vril lets Waverider go so that this future will not come to pass.\n\nHe appeared in the new digital first comic book \"Adventures of Supergirl\" series on January 24, 2016, which ties-in to the CBS/CW \"Supergirl\" TV series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1947681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947681", "title": "William Brocius", "text": "William Brocius\n\nWilliam Brocius (1845 – March 24, 1882), better known as Curly Bill Brocius, was a gunman, rustler and an outlaw Cowboy in the Cochise County area of the Arizona Territory during the early 1880s. His name is likely an alias or nickname, and some evidence links him to another outlaw named William \"Curly Bill\" Bresnaham, who was convicted of an 1878 attempted robbery and murder in El Paso, Texas.\n\nBrocius had a number of conflicts with the lawmen of the Earp family, and he was named as one of the individuals who participated in Morgan Earp's assassination. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp and a group of deputies including his brother Warren Earp pursued those they believed responsible for Morgan's death. The Earp posse unexpectedly encountered Curly Bill and other Cowboys on March 24, 1882, at Iron Springs (present day Mescal Springs). Wyatt killed Curly Bill during the shootout. In his journal written in October 1881, George Parsons referred to Brocius as \"Arizona's most famous outlaw\".\n\nBrocius arrived in Arizona Territory from either Texas or Missouri about 1878, and went briefly to the San Carlos Reservation with a herd of cattle, before arriving in the Arizona Territory.\n\nBrocius was an Outlaw Cowboy and a rustler, and was for a time also a tax collector for Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, making other rustlers pay taxes on their stolen cattle (the money went into the sheriff's coffers and added to his salary).\n\nBrocius was known for a mean sense of humor when drunk. He was reported to have perpetrated such \"practical jokes\" as using gunfire to make a preacher \"dance\" during a sermon and making Mexicans at a community dance take off their clothes and dance naked. (Both incidents were reported by Wells Fargo agent Fred Dodge in his memoirs, and both incidents are alluded to in the newspapers of the time).\n\nA unauthenticated photo of Brocius is displayed in the Bird Cage Theater Museum in Tombstone. Two other unauthenticated photos of Brocius have been provided by descendants. Several writers who knew Brocius reported that he was well-built with curly black hair and a freckled complexion.\n\nIn a drunken revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols into the air on October 28, 1880, in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands. Tombstone's Town Marshal Fred White attempted to disarm Brocius and grabbed his weapon by the barrel. The gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Wyatt Earp had borrowed Fred Dodge's pistol and he pistol-whipped Brocius. At the preliminary hearing for Brocius afterward, Wyatt testified that he had heard White say: \"I am an officer; give me your pistol.\" When he got close, he saw Brocius remove his pistol from his scabbard and White grab it by the barrel. He said he put his arms around Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White \"gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off.\" White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt buffaloed Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, \"What have I done? I have not done anything to be arrested for.\"\n\nWhite was carried to a doctor and they initially thought he would recover, and the next day, he gave a statement that exonerated Curly Bill of murder, but that night, White's condition worsened. Brocius later claimed that his gun discharged accidentally and reportedly immediately regretted shooting White. He testified at his trial that he did not consider himself to have committed a crime. Brocius waived his right to a preliminary hearing, apparently because he feared a lynching, as White was very popular as town marshal. Brocius was anxious to be moved out of town. Pima County Deputy Sheriff Earp and George Collins immediately took Brocius to Tucson for trial.\n\nWhite died two days after Curly Bill shot him. Before dying, White testified that he thought the pistol had accidentally discharged and that he did not believe that Curly Bill shot him on purpose. Wyatt Earp supported this testimony, (ironically, given his later vendetta against Brocius and the rest of the Cowboy gang) as did a demonstration that Brocius's pistol could be fired from half-cock, and the fact that it had been found to contain six rounds, with only one of them fired. After spending most of November and December 1880 in jail awaiting trial, Brocius was acquitted with a verdict of accidental death.\n\nWyatt told his biographer John H. Flood, Jr., many years later that he thought that Brocius was still armed at the time and did not notice that Brocius' pistol lay on the ground in the dark, until Brocius was already down. Despite being responsible for the deaths of several other men during his life, Brocius had apparently personally liked White and maintained that his death had been an accident.\n\nBrocius was described by contemporary Billy Breakenridge in his book \"Helldorado: Bringing the Law to the Mesquite\" as being the most deadly pistol shot of the Cowboys, able to hit running jackrabbits, shoot out candle flames without breaking the candles or lantern holders, and shoot quarters from between the fingers of \"volunteers\". When drunk, Brocius was also known for a mean sense of humor and for such \"practical jokes\" as using gunfire to make a preacher \"dance\" during a sermon or forcing Mexicans at a community dance to take off their clothes and dance naked. Wells Fargo agent Fred Dodge reported both incidents in his memoirs, and both were alluded to in local newspapers.\n\nOn March 8, 1881, Brocius and his friend Johnny Ringo rode to Maxey, near Camp Thomas, Arizona. Cowboy Dick Lloyd got drunk while playing poker in O'Neil and Franklin's saloon. After shooting and wounding one man, Lloyd rode his horse into the saloon where Brocius was drinking. Brocius and several other men resented the interruption, and about a dozen of them, including Brocius, shot and killed Lloyd. Owner O'Neil took the blame and was acquitted.\n\nOn May 25, 1881, Brocius was drinking heavily in Galeyville with his friend of several months and Lincoln County War veteran Jim Wallace and eight or nine other cowboys. Wallace insulted Brocius' friend and ally, Tombstone Deputy Marshal Billy Breakenridge. Breakenridge ignored him, but Brocius took offense and insisted that Wallace accompany him and apologize to Breakenridge. Brocius threatened to kill him. Wallace complied, but Brocius afterward heaped abuse on Wallace, announcing, \"You damned Lincoln County son of a bitch, I'll kill you anyhow.\" Wallace left the saloon and Curly Bill followed him. Feeling threatened, Wallace shot Curly Bill, wounding him in the cheek and neck.\n\nMarshal Breakenridge arrested Wallace, but the court ruled he acted in self-defense. Curly Bill may have first met Pony Diehl around this time, as well. Diehl was implicated in several Cowboy criminal activities later on.\n\nIn July 1881, Bill Leonard and Harry Head attempted to rob William and Isaac Haslett's general store in Hachita, New Mexico. The Haslett brothers killed Leonard and Head during the hold-up. Some modern researchers state that Brocius and friend Johnny Ringo rode to New Mexico to avenge their friends' deaths and killed both Haslett brothers. However, no witnesses to this crime were found nor to Curly Bill's involvement in the Hasletts' death.\n\nFour months after Brocius was shot, on October 6, 1881, George Parsons rode through the McLaury brothers' ranch in Sulphur Springs Valley as part of an Indian scouting party, and noted that Brocius had not yet fully recovered from his wound, but was well enough to ride. For this reason, many historians doubt that Brocius took part in killing William and Isaac Haslett.\n\nIn July, some reports say that Brocius ambushed a Mexican trail herd in what became known as the Skeleton Canyon Massacre. Six\" vaqueros\" were killed and the remainder captured, then possibly tortured and murdered. Curly Bill reportedly sold the Mexican beef he stole to Newman Haynes Clanton the next month. When Old Man Clanton was on the trail herding the beef to Tombstone, four others and he were, in turn, ambushed in the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre and murdered by Mexicans. No contemporary reports of Curly Bill's involvement in these episodes were verified, and Brocius was not charged with any crimes related to these events.\n\nBrocius was still recovering from being shot in the face by Wallace only six weeks earlier. Some modern researchers doubt that he was well enough to take part in these events.\n\nFollowing the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, Brocius robbed the Tombstone-Bisbee stagecoach on January 6, 1882, and the Tombstone-Benson stage the next day. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a posse and rode after the men, but was unable to find them in the Chiricahua Mountains. Brocius returned to Tombstone on March 17. He was named by Pete Spence's wife Marietta Duarte as a participant in the assassination of Morgan Earp. Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer disallowed her testimony because it was hearsay and because she could not testify against her husband. Lacking evidence, the prosecution dropped all charges against the Cowboys. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp killed outlaw Cowboy Frank Stilwell in Tucson on March 20, 1882, while guarding his brother Virgil en route to California.\n\nOn March 24, 1882, the Earp party was expecting to meet Charlie Smith at Iron Springs (later Mescal Springs), in the Whetstone Mountains. Charlie was bringing cash from Tombstone about to the east to help pay posse expenses. As they surmounted the edge of a wash near the springs, they stumbled upon Brocius, Pony Diehl, Johnny Barnes, Frank Patterson, Milt Hicks, Bill Hicks, Bill Johnson, Ed Lyle, and Johnny Lyle, cooking a meal alongside the spring.\n\nAccording to Wyatt Earp — and an anonymous report to \"The Tombstone Epitaph\"— he was in the lead of the posse when it suddenly came upon The Cowboys' camp less than 30 feet (9m) behind an embankment. Earp dismounted shotgun in hand, and seeing him The Cowboys seized their weapons. Texas Jack Vermillion remained cool under fire and stuck close to Wyatt during the fight. Lacking cover, Doc, Johnson, and McMasters retreated. Warren Earp was away on an errand at the time.\n\nEighteen months prior, Wyatt Earp had protected Brocius against a mob ready to lynch him for killing Town Marshal Fred White, and then provided testimony that helped spare him from a murder conviction. Now Brocius fired at Earp with his shotgun from about , but missed, Earp returned fire with his own shotgun, killing Brocius with a load of buckshot to the stomach nearly cutting him in half. Brocius fell into the water at the edge of the spring.\n\nThe Cowboys fired a number of shots at the Earp party. Texas Jack Vermillion's horse was struck and killed. Earp's long coat was punctured by bullets on both sides. Another bullet struck his boot heel and his saddle horn was hit, as well, burning the saddle hide and narrowly missing Wyatt. Firing his pistol, Earp shot Johnny Barnes in the chest and Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him gain cover. Earp had trouble remounting his horse due to a cartridge belt that had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse and retreat. McMasters was grazed by a bullet that cut through the straps of his field glasses.\n\nEarp biographer John Flood wrote that The Cowboys buried Brocius' body on the nearby ranch of Frank Patterson near the Babocomari River. This is close to the original McLaury ranch site about 5 miles (8 km) west of Fairbank (before the McLaurys moved to the Sulphur Springs Valley in late 1880) and is believed to have originally belonged to Frank Stilwell. Brocius's grave site has never been identified.\n\nFred J. Dodge, an undercover operative for Wells Fargo in Tombstone, asked Curly Bill's associates about his death. He wrote that he talked to \"J. B. Ayers, a saloonkeeper of Charleston where the outlaws and rustlers headquartered, told me that the men who were in the fight told him that Wyatt Earp killed Curly Bill and that they took the body away that night and that they buried him on Patterson's ranch on the Babocomari.\" The Tombstone \"Nugget\" first put up a $1,000 reward for proof Curly Bill lived, and \"The Tombstone Epitaph\" countered with a $2,000 reward. Neither was ever collected. Brocius was not wanted by the law in Arizona and if he was not dead had no reason to disappear. He also was unlikely to return to Texas, where according to Wyatt Earp's recollection, he was probably still wanted for murder.\n\nBecause of his nickname, \"Curly Bill\" Brocius has been confused with \"Curly Bill\" Graham, a different outlaw of the same geographical region and time period. Graham was killed in a gunfight by Deputy Sheriff James D. Houck on October 17, 1887, and buried in Young, Arizona, and is not considered by historians to be the same Curly Bill of Charleston and Tombstone. Brocius' birth date, birth name, and birthplace are not known.\n\nIn newspapers of the time, Brocius was known alternately as \"Curly Bill\" and \"Curley Bill.\" His surname has also been spelled as \"Brocious\", although the former is the spelling used for his maildrop in Arizona Territory, according to one published letter of the time.\n\nHistorical research into Brocius' death turned up two possible earlier identities. Denis McLoughlin in \"The Encyclopedia of the Old West\" reports that Brocius was from Missouri and named William B. Graham. He said Brocius rode for various Texas cow outfits and was known in Kansas.\n\nWhile on the way to Tucson, Brocius asked Wyatt Earp to recommend an attorney. As reported in \"The Tombstone Epitaph\":\n\nWyatt looked into the story about Brocius' time in Texas and learned that Brocius had been convicted of robbery in El Paso, Texas, during which a man had been killed. Zabriskie had prosecuted Brocius for the crime, and \"he was tried and sentenced to the penitentiary, but managed to make his escape shortly after being incarcerated.\"\n\nThe \"El Paso Daily Times\" speculated that he was the man whom Texas Ranger Thomas Mode shot in the right ear.\n\nModern researchers have linked Brocius with a man known as William \"Curly Bill\" Bresnaham, who was convicted in a robbery attempt in Texas in 1878, along with another known cowboy of the Tombstone area named Robert Martin. The men were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, but both escaped, presumably to the southwest Arizona Territory. Since both Robert Martin and Curly Bill became known as leaders of the rustlers in Arizona Territory, they are likely the same Robert Martin and Curly Bill of the Texas crime.\n\nAccording to historian Robert M. Utley, Robert Martin was a member of the Jesse Evans gang of outlaws in New Mexico during the mid- to late 1870s. Billy the Kid briefly joined this group before going to work for John Tunstall. Evans's gang, a loose-knit consortium of desperadoes known as \"The Boys\", ended up fighting against the \"Regulators\" during the Lincoln County War. Because of the time frame, the location, and his friendship with Martin, Curly Bill Brocius may have been a member of the Evans gang, as well.\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Winchester (1826–1830) and Oriel College, Oxford, but he left the university without proceeding to a degree in 1831 As his father had died in 1824, he succeeded to the family estates on coming of age and was a popular landlord, the more so as he was resident.

In 1850, he became a Roman Catholic and thereafter took a prominent part in Catholic affairs, especially in Parliament. As a friend of Wiseman, Newman, Montalambert, W. G. Ward, and other eminent Catholics, he was intimately acquainted with the various interests of the Church, and his parliamentary position was often of great advantage to the Church.\n\nIn 1852 Monsell was appointed Clerk of the Ordnance by Lord Aberdeen, a post he retained until 1857, the last two years under the premiership of Lord Palmerston. In 1855 he was sworn of the Privy Council. He was briefly President of the Board of Health under Palmerston in 1857 and later served under Lord Russell as Paymaster-General and Vice-President of the Board of Trade in 1866 and under William Ewart Gladstone as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1868 and 1871 and as Postmaster-General between January 1871 and November 1873. He was also Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick between 1871 and 1894 and Vice-Chancellor of the Royal University of Ireland between 1885 and 1894.\n\nOn 12 January 1874 Monsell was raised to the peerage as Baron Emly, of Tervoe in the County of Limerick. He lost much of his popularity in Ireland during his later years, because of his opposition to the Irish National Land League and to the home rule movement in Ireland. His work being chiefly parliamentary, he wrote little, but published some articles in the \"Home and Foreign Review\" and a \"Lecture on the Roman Question\" (1860).\n\nLord Emly was twice married. He married firstly Lady Anna Maria Charlotte Wyndham-Quin (1814–1855), only daughter of Windham Quin, 2nd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, in August 1836, with whom he had two sons, both of whom died in infancy. After her death on 7 January 1855, he married Bertha (1835–1890), youngest daughter the Comte de Montigny of the house of Montigny de Perreux, in 1857, by whom he had one son Gaston (1858–1932), later the second Lord Emly, and one daughter Mary Olivia (1860–1942). Lord Emly died in April 1894, aged 81.\n\n"}
{"id": "457803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457803", "title": "Yusuf al-Qaradawi", "text": "Yusuf al-Qaradawi\n\nYusuf al-Qaradawi (; or \"Yusuf al-Qardawi\"; born 9 September 1926) is an Egyptian Islamic theologian based in Doha, Qatar, and chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars. He got influences from Hassan al Banna, Abul A'la Maududi and Naeem Siddiqui. He is best known for his programme الشريعة والحياة, \"al-Sharīʿa wa al-Ḥayāh\" (\"Sharia and Life\"), broadcast on Al Jazeera, which has an estimated audience of 40-60 million worldwide.\nHe is also known for IslamOnline, a website he helped to found in 1997 and for which he serves as chief religious scholar.\n\nAl-Qaradawi's books can be found worldwide in local bookstores. He has published more than 120 books, including his famous \"The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam\" and \"Islam: The Future Civilization\". He has also received eight international prizes for his contributions to Islamic scholarship, and is considered one of the most influential such scholars living today. Al-Qaradawi has long had a prominent role within the intellectual leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian political organization, although he has repeatedly stated that he is no longer a member and twice (in 1976 and 2004) turned down offers for the official role in the organization.\n\nSome of al-Qaradawi's views, such as his condoning of Palestinian suicide bombings against Israelis, have caused reactions from governments in the West: he was refused an entry visa to the United Kingdom in 2008, and barred from entering France in 2012.\n\nAs of 2004, al-Qaradawi was a trustee of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. He also served as a consultant scholar for an epic movie in English on Muhammad, and a 30-part series on the second caliph 'Umar b. al-Khaṭṭāb.\n\nAlso in February 2009, Barrie M. Osborne, producer of \"The Matrix\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogies, was attached to produce a new film about the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. The film is to be financed by Qatar with a provisional budget of US$1 billion and supervised by al-Qaradawi. The filming only started in 2015 after rigorous consultations with leading Islamic scholars for almost 6 years. Although originally expected to air in 2018, no information has been released on the film since 2015.\n\nAl-Qaradawi was born in 1926 in Saft Turab village in the Nile Delta, now in Gharbia Governorate, Egypt, into a poor family of devout Muslim peasants. He became an orphan at the age of two, when he lost his father. Following his father's death, he was raised by his uncle. He read and memorized the entire Quran by the time he was nine years old.\n\nHe then joined the Institute of Religious Studies at Tanta, and graduated after nine years of study. While in Tanta, Al-Qaradawi first encountered Hassan al Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, when al Banna gave a lecture at his school. Al-Qaradawi has written of the lasting impact of this encounter, describing al Banna as \"brilliantly radiating, as if his words were revelation or live coals from the light of prophecy.\" He moved on to study Islamic Theology at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, from which he graduated in 1953. He earned a diploma in Arabic Language and Literature in 1958 at the Advanced Arabic Studies Institute. He enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Quran and Sunnah Sciences of the Faculty of Religion's Fundamentals (Usul al-Din), and graduated with a master's degree in Quranic Studies in 1960. In 1962, he was sent by Al-Azhar University to Qatar to head the Qatari Secondary Institute of Religious Studies. He completed his PhD thesis titled \"Zakah and its effect on solving social problems\" in 1973 with First Merit and was awarded his PhD degree from Al-Azhar.\n\nIn 1977, he laid the foundation for the Faculty of Shari'ah and Islamic Studies in the University of Qatar and became the faculty's dean. In the same year he founded the Centre of Seerah and Sunna Research. He also served at the Institute of Imams, Egypt under the Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments as supervisor before moving back to Doha as Dean of the Islamic Department at the Faculties of Shariah and Education in Qatar, where he continued until 1990. His next appointment was in Algeria as Chairman of the Scientific Council of Islamic University and Higher Institutions in 1990–91. He returned to Qatar once more as Director of the Seerah and Sunnah Center at Qatar University, a post he still occupies today.\n\nIn 1997, Al-Qaradawi helped found the European Council for Fatwa and Research, a council of important and influential Muslim scholars dedicated to researching and writing fatwas in support of Western Muslim minority communities based in Ireland, and he serves as its head. He also serves as the chairman of International Union for Muslim Scholars (IUMS).\n\nHe was imprisoned under King Farouq in 1949, then three times during the reign of former President Gamal Abdul Nasser, until he left Egypt for Qatar in 1961. He returned to Egypt in 2011 in the wake of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.\n\nAl-Qaradawi is a principal shareholder and former Sharia adviser to Bank Al-Taqwa, a member bank of the Lugano-Switzerland Al-Taqwa group, a bank that the U.S. states finances terrorism and that the UN Security Council had listed as associated with Al Qaeda. On 2 August 2010, the bank was removed from a list of entities and individuals associated with Al Qaeda maintained by the Security Council.\n\nAl-Qaradawi finished 3rd in a 2008 poll on who was the world's leading public intellectual. The poll, Top 100 Public Intellectuals, was of the readers of \"Prospect Magazine\" (UK) and \"Foreign Policy\" (United States).\n\nAfter the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, Qaradawi made his first public appearance in Egypt after 1981. In Tahrir Square, he led Friday prayers on 18 February, addressing an audience estimated to exceed two million Egyptians. It began with an address of \"O Muslims and Copts\", referring to Egypt's Coptic Christian minority instead of the customary opening for Islamic Friday sermons \"O Muslims\". He was reported to have said, \"Egyptian people are like the genie who came out of the lamp and who have been in prison for 30 years.\" He also demanded the release of political prisoners in Egyptian prisons, praised the Copts for protecting Muslims in their Friday prayer, and called for the new military rulers to quickly restore civilian rule. He referred to Mubarak as a \"Tyrannical Pharaoh\".\n\nOn 21 February 2011, he talked about the protests in Libya and issued a fatwa permitting the killing of Muammar Gaddafi:\n\nHe also called on Libyan ambassadors around the world to distance themselves from Gaddafi's government.\n\nIn the \"Jerusalem Post\", Barry Rubin drew a parallel between Qaradawi's sermon and the Ayatollah Khomeini returning to Iran. He also said that Qaradawi was encouraging the Muslim Brotherhood to suppress opposition when he made reference to hypocrites in his sermon. Brookings Institution member Shadi Hamid says that Qaradawi is in the mainstream of Egyptian society, and that he also has appeal among Egyptians who are not Islamist. In the \"Eurasia Review\", Princeton University student Aaron Rock dismisses claims that Qaradawi is the Khomeini of Egypt, but he does see his influence as a sign that Islam will play a significant role in the shaping of Egypt's politics. He writes, \"Neither Qaradawi's popularity nor his rhetoric should distract from the fact that Egyptian revolution's grievances were based on a desire for political liberty and economic opportunity. That said, Islam remains an important framework for public debate and a reservoir of political symbolism.\"\n\nAl-Qaradawi has written on the danger of extremist groups of Islam, in his dissertation on the subject \"Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism\". In it he warns of the dangers of blind obedience, bigotry and intolerance; rigidity—which deprives people of clarity of vision and the opportunity for dialogue with others; commitment to excessiveness, including the excessive application of minor or controversial Islamic issues to people in non-Muslim countries or to people who have only recently converted to Islam; harshness in the treatment of people, roughness in the manner of approach, and crudeness in calling people to Islam, all which are contrary to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah.\n\nOn the other hand, Al-Qaradawi himself has advocated extremism and anti-semitism, denouncing Jews for their \"corruption\" and describing Adolf Hitler as having put Jews \"in their place\". While others believe Al-Qaradawi is merely \"not afraid to state firmly that 'Palestinian martyr operations are a weapon of the weak'\".\n\nAl-Qaradawi has been an avid caller to what he calls \"Islamic Sufism\", praising those who practice it as pious.\n\nAl-Qaradawi has disparaged Shi'ites as innovators (\"mubtadiʿūn\") and warned of the \"Shiitization\" of the Middle East, saying Shiite Muslims were \"invading\" Sunni societies. In response, the Iranian Mehr News Agency described Qaradawi as \"a spokesman for international Freemasonry and rabbis\". Even fellow members of the International Union of Muslim Scholars such as Mohammad Salim Al-Awa criticized Qaradawi for promoting divisions among Muslims.\n\nIn May 2013, al-Qaradawi has also verbally attacked the Alawite sect, which many describe as an offshoot of Shia Islam and of which President Bashir al-Assad is a member, as \"more infidel than Christians and Jews\" (أكفر من اليهود والنصارى).\n\nHowever, in 2010, al-Qaradawi met with Shi'a scholar Ayatollah Hassan al-Saffar and urged to work their differences and come together and promote peace and disregard for sectarian strife like what the hardline are doing to create more dissension and discord between Shi'a and Sunni.\n\nAl-Qaradawi has been a staunch critic of Salafism (Wahhabism). He says this group stems its roots from Saudi Arabia and is just 200-years-old since its establishment compared to Islam which have existed for over 1,400 years who've lived in peace and harmony with Christians, Jews and other faiths. He says this group was created by Saudi Arabia's founder Ibn Saud together with Salafi (Wahhabi) founder Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab whom was all from Najd (today Riyadh) with the help of British after toppling the legitimate Islamic Empire of Ottomans which was mainstream Sunni Islam at that time and that it also see the oust of Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca) who're the original Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in charge of Makkah's Al-Masjid al-Haram and Madinah's Al-Masjid an-Nabawi for over a thousand years since the time of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad whom is also the Prophet's direct descendant; the Hashemites, which now resides and rule over Jordan which have no natural resources and regarded as among the poorest Arab countries in the Middle East. Qaradawi warned the world that it were Salafists (Wahhabists) that has caused terrorism all over the world especially groups like Islamic State, Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Al-Shabaab, Abu Sayyaf and other similar groups alike. He also said that Israel and America heavily exploits from these groups by funding them since the 1970s until the present-day to pursue their (Western) political agenda in controlling the vast wealth of oil, gas, coal and mine to further destabilized the natural-resource-rich Middle East and beyond. Qaradawi also said that if more terrorist attacks were to occur, Israel will greatly benefit from it as it will give boosts to the sales of Israeli security companies and firms to promote their high-tech equipment globally in both hard and software forms. Qaradawi stated that the deceitful evil implications of those countries' complicity with this group is irreversible and has no end in sight. He compared them (takfiri groups) to dogs from Hell-fire for using religion to kill the innocents. He further said that Ash'aris, Maturidis can overcome their tiny existence. He issued a fatwa (edict) in 2014 denouncing the Islamic State (Daesh) declaration of \"caliphate\" and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as \"invalid, null and void\" from every aspect, every angle of the Islamic Sharia Law.\n\nAl-Qaradawi has called for dialogue with Non-Muslims. He also puts emphasis on conversations with the West, including Jews, Christians, and secularists. He writes that this effort should differentiate itself from a debate, for the latter does not often result in mutual cooperation. Regarding the rights and citizenship of non-Muslim minorities, Qaradawi has said, \"those people who live under the protection of an Islamic government enjoy special privileges. They are referred to as 'the Protected People' (dhimmi) ... In modern terminology, dhimmies are 'citizens' of the Islamic state. From the earliest period of Islam to the present day, Muslims are in unanimous agreement that they enjoy the same rights and carry the same responsibilities as Muslims themselves, while being free to practice their own faiths.\"\n\nIn his book titled \"The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam\", al-Qaradawi wrote, \"Islam does not prohibit Muslims to be kind and generous to peoples of other religions, even if they are idolaters and polytheists, ... it looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard, whether they reside in a Muslim society or outside it. The Qur'an never addresses them without saying, 'O People of the Book' or 'O You who have been given the Book', indicating that they were originally people of a revealed religion. For this reason there exists a relationship of mercy and spiritual kinship between them and the Muslims.\"\n\nIn May 2008, al-Qaradawi told visiting Rabbis from the Haredi, Anti-Zionist Neturei Karta sect, \"there is no enmity between Muslims and Jews ... Jews who believe in the authentic Torah are very close to Muslims.\" He has also expressed his belief that relations between Muslims and Jews became strained with the emergence of Zionism and the establishment of Israel. \"Muslims are against the expansionist, oppressive Zionist movement, not the Jews.\" Reportedly, in 1998 the Associated Press quoted al-Qaradawi writing, \"There should be no dialogue with these people [Israelis] except with swords.\"\n\nIn August 2005, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that the Dublin-based European Council for Fatwa and Research, of which al-Qaradhawi is president, had used the antisemitic \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" in its theological deliberations. Al-Qaradawi's remarks were sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which accused him of inciting violence against Jews.\n\nIn a 9 January 2009 sermon during the Gaza War, shown on Al-Jazeera, Qaradawi prayed (as translated by MEMRI):\n\nIn a sermon broadcast on \"Qatar TV\" on 26 April 2013 (as translated by MEMRI), Qaradawi announced that he would not participate in an inter-faith dialogue if Jews were present, stating, \"If you invite the Jews, I will not participate. I will participate in a Muslim-Christian meeting, but with the Jews there should be no debate.\" Qaradawi stated that there can be \"no debate whatsoever with those who have committed injustice\" and \"Those Jews have committed clear injustice against us. They have shed our blood, killed our children, displaced our people, seized our lands, and usurped our rights.\" Later in his sermon, Qaradawi restated: \"I cannot be a part of a conference in which wrongdoing Jews participate. They have committed great injustice, and I cannot possibly shake hands with them. Their hands are soiled with blood. They have murderous, violent, and oppressive hands. I cannot soil my hands by shaking theirs.\"\n\nAl-Qaradawi has defended the mass murder of millions during the Holocaust as a \"punishment.\" In a statement that aired on Al-Jazeera TV on 28 January 2009 during the Gaza War, al-Qaradawi said the following regarding Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust (as translated by MEMRI):\n\nAl-Qaradawi says that apostasy – Muslims leaving Islam – is a grave danger to the Muslim community and that it is the duty of all Muslims \"is to combat apostasy in all its forms and wherefrom it comes, giving it no chance to pervade in the Muslim world\". In February 2013, Qaradawi stated on Egyptian television that the application of the death penalty for those who leave Islam is a necessity, stating, \"If they had gotten rid of the apostasy punishment Islam wouldn't exist today.\" Qaradawi also cited several speeches and writings by Muhammad and his followers, such as Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:33, which he quoted as \"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle is that they should be murdered or crucified.\" Qaradawi further explained, \" ... many hadiths, not only one or two, but many, narrated by a number of Muhammad's companions state that any apostate should be killed. Ibn 'Abbas's hadith: 'Kill whoever changes his faith [from Islam].'\"\n\nWith regards to the punishment of apostasy, al-Qaradawi supports the classical Islamic tradition on some points but differs on others. He considers execution as a penalty in principle, but the only apostates that are to be executed are those that combine other crimes with apostasy (e.g., \"incit[ing] a war against Islam\"). He also advocates apostates to be given a chance to repent. Finally, he believes that \"hidden apostasy\" (where the apostate does not \"proclaim\" his conversion) may be left to the judgement of God in the Hereafter.\n\nWhile al-Qaradawi believes that the Muslim community is not allowed to punish \"intellectual apostasy\", where the apostates do not \"swagger\" about their conversion, he still strongly condemns it. He says \"These people are not noticed when they invade or begin to disseminate their falsehood, but they are mostly felt when they affect the minds. They do not use guns in their attacks, however, their attacks are fierce and cunning.\" Nevertheless, he concedes, \"Erudite scholars and well versed jurists ... can not take an action in face of such professional criminals who have firmly established themselves and have not left a chance for law to be enforced on them.\"\n\nAl-Qaradawi has spoken in favor of democracy in the Muslim world, speaking of a need for reform of political climates in the Middle East specifically. On 22 February 2011, he held an exclusive interview with OnIslam.net, dismissing the allegation that he wanted a religious state established in Egypt: \"On the contrary, my speech supported establishing a civil state with a religious background, I am totally against theocracy. We are not a state for mullahs.\"\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, al-Qaradawi urged Muslims to donate blood for the victims and said:\n\nHe denies that Palestinian suicide bombing attacks constitute terrorism, claiming, \"when Palestinians face such unjust aggression, they tend to stem bloodletting and destruction and not to claim the lives of innocent civilians,\" but qualifies that with \"I do agree with those who do not allow such martyr operations to be carried out outside the Palestinian territories.\"\n\nAl-Qaradawi has suggested the legitimate use of (defensive) suicide bombings against enemy combatants in modern times if the defending combatants have no other means of self-defense. The Oxford-based Malaysian Islamic Scholar, Dr. Afifi al-Akiti, rules that there is no Islamic legal precedent for this view and that female soldiers can only be killed in direct combat. With regards to suicide bombings he says that they are \"breaching the scholarly consensus ... because to endanger one's life is one thing and to commit suicide during the attack is obviously another\". With regards to male soldiers he states, \"It goes without saying that they are considered combatants as soon as they arrive on the battlefield even if they are not in direct combat – provided of course that the remaining conventions of war have been observed throughout, and that all this is during a valid war when there is no ceasefire.\"\n\nWestern governments have met al-Qaradawi to request release of European civilians kidnapped in Iraq and have thanked him officially, praising his cooperation. The French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier wrote to al-Qaradawi: \"With such a clear condemnation of the abduction of the French hostages you have sent a clear-cut message demonstrating respect for the tenets of Islam.\"\n\nAl-Qaradawi condones Palestinian attacks on Israelis only if Israel continues its oppression and averts peace. A resolution issued by The Islamic Fiqh Council affiliated to the Saudi-run Muslim World League in its 14th session, held in Doha (Qatar) on 11–16 January 2003 has upheld his views on the matter. Defending bombings against Israeli civilians, al-Qaradawi told \"BBC Newsnight\" in 2005 that:\n\nHe supports suicide attacks on all Israelis, including women since he views the Israeli society as a \"completely military\" society that did not include any civilians. He also considers pregnant women and their unborn babies to be valid targets on the ground that the babies could grow up to join the Israeli Army.\n\nAt the press conference held by the organizations sponsoring his visit to London, al-Qaradawi reiterated his view that suicide attacks are a justified form of resistance to Israeli occupation of the rightfully Palestinian territories. He has also justified his views by stating that all Israeli civilians are potential soldiers, since Israel is a \"militarized society\". Because of these views, al-Qaradawi has been accused by Western countries and Israel of supporting terrorism.\n\nAn article wrote by Jewish editor Michael Slackman from Los Angeles Times later (The New York Times), commenting on suicide bombings conducted by Palestinians against Israelis al-Qaradawi declared during an interview with the newspaper Al Raya in April 2001: \"They are not suicide operations. These are heroic martyrdom operations, and the heroes who carry them out don't embark on this action out of hopelessness and despair but are driven by an overwhelming desire to cast terror and fear into the hearts of the oppressors.\"\n\nAl-Qaradawi is opposed to attacks outside of the Palestinian Territories and Israel, and against non-Israeli targets. For example, on 20 March 2005, he condemned a car bombing that had occurred in Doha, Qatar the previous day. One Briton, Jon Adams was killed. Al-Qaradawi issued a statement that said\n\nAccording to IslamOnline, Qaradawi released a fatwa on 14 April 2004 stating boycott of American and Israeli products was an obligation for all who are able. The fatwa reads in part :\n\nOn 8 May 2013, Qaradawi visited Gaza and gave a speech in support of Hamas. He asked all of the Palestinian people to work with other Arab people and Muslims around the world to destroy Israel, saying inflammatory things such as \"Our wish should be that we carry out Jihad to death\" and \"We should seek to liberate Palestine, all of Palestine, inch by inch.\"\n\nMore recently according to The Investigative Project on Terrorism report wrote by Anti-Islam journalist Steven Emerson, al-Qaradawi published a message in Arabic on his website which was translated by The Investigative Project on Terrorism in which he called on Muslims to join the \"greatest battle of liberation\" against Israel and against the Jews in general. The preacher allegedly protested the closure of Temple Mount after the assassination attempt that killed an Israeli activist, where the third holiest shrine for Islam is located, namely Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque.\n\nAlong the same line citing from New York-based Jewish-run ADL (Anti-Defamation League) report, in 24 January 2011 al-Qaradawi had voiced his desire to see Jerusalem conquered in a fatwa in which he claimed that it was the Muslims' duty to \"defend\" Jerusalem with \"their lives, their money and all they pos-sess, or else they will be subject to Allah's punishment.\"\n\nIn July 2015, al-Qaradawi argued on the TV show Ala-Masouliyati (I Am Responsible) that it is permissible for suicide bombers to self-detonate if requested by a group. Conversely, individuals are prohibited from carrying out suicide bombings on their own.\n\nOn the subject of the Western Wall, Qaradawi said:\n\nIn 2004 the International Union of Muslim Scholars, an organization chaired by al-Qaradawi which counts a great number of prominent individual affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood and/or Hamas among its members, ruled that \"resisting occupation troops in Iraq is a 'duty' on able Muslims in and outside the war-torn country and that aiding the occupier is impermissible.\"\n\nIn an address aired on Qatar TV on 5 January 2007, al-Qaradawi questioned the trial of Saddam Hussein under American supervision in Iraq, but agreed to it if it were conducted by the Iraqi people \"after liberating Iraq from American colonialism\". He also suggested that the trial was \"an act of vengeance by the Americans\" for his missile attacks on Israel. He strongly criticized the way Saddam was hanged:\n\nIn 2006, in response to Muslim scholar Abdullah Ibn Jibreen's fatwa declaring that it was forbidden for Muslims to support or pray for Hezbollah because they are Shia, al-Qaradawi said that supporting Hezbollah is a religious duty for all Muslims and that resistance, whether in Palestine or Lebanon, is the most noble act. He added \"Shias agree with the Sunnis in the main principles of Islam while the differences are only over the branches\" and also called upon the Sunnis and Shia of Iraq to end the civil war.\n\nSeven years later, during the Syrian Civil War, Qaradawi urged all Sunnis to fight Hezbollah, attacking Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran: \"The leader of the Party of Satan comes to fight the Sunnis ... Now we know what the Iranians want ... They want continued massacres to kill Sunnis.\" Qaradawi also stated that he now regretted having advocated rapprochement between Sunnis and Shias and his 2006 defense of Hezbollah.\n\nQaradawi declared his support for the rebels led by the National Transitional Council in the 2011 Libyan civil war, urging Arab nations to recognize them and \"to confront the tyranny of the regime in Tripoli\". He suggested weapons be sent to the rebels to assist the, and said \"Our Islamic nation should stand against injustice and corruption and I urge the Egyptian government to extend a helping hand to Libyan people and not to Gaddafi.\"\n\nIn response to the 2011 Bahrain protests, Qaradawi was reluctant to give support: \"The protests in Bahrain are sectarian in nature. The Shias are revolting against the Sunnis.\" He claimed that Shia protesters attack Sunnis and occupied their mosques. He acknowledged that the Shia majority had legitimate concerns in regards to fairness with the Sunnis: \"I want them to be real citizens of their country.\"\n\nQaradawi said that all Arabs should back up the protesters in the 2011 Syrian uprising, saying \"Today the train of revolution has reached a station that it had to reach: The Syria station,\" and \"It is not possible for Syria to be separated from the history of the Arab community.\" He declared his support for the protests against what he called Syria's \"oppressive regime\", claiming \"atrocities\" were committed by it. He called for victory against the ruling Ba'ath party and claimed the army would be the major factor in the revolt. He claimed that when he offered to mediate negotiations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian government, someone deliberately sabotaged it. Qaradawi also expressed his support for the No Fly zone put in place by western nations over Libya, saying \"The operation in Libya is to protect the civilians from Gaddafi's tyranny\" and slamming Arab League leader Amr Moussa for criticism of it.\n\nCommenting on the role women played in social active issues:\n\nAccording to Kamal Badr, Qaradawi advocates that rape victims be protected by society:\n\nThus, many Muslim scholars, led by Sheikh Al-Qaradawi, have maintained that young Muslim men should hasten to marry women who fall as rape victims, so as to reduce their suffering and console them, to compensate them for the loss of the most precious thing that they possess. This reflects mutual love, rapport and altruism that prevail in the Muslim society.\n\nAl-Qaradawi told \"The Guardian\" that wife beating was neither \"obligatory nor desirable\" but that he \"accepts it as a method of last resort – though only \"lightly\"\". He stated on Channel 4 News that it was justifiable in certain circumstances but the \"ideal was for Muslim men never to beat their wives, and if husbands wrongly beat their wives, they have the right to fight back\". The British newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\" writes that al-Qaradawi, in his book \"The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam\", states that wife-beating is permissible after the failure of all other means of persuasion. In such circumstances, a husband may beat his wife \"lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive areas\".\n\nQaradawi says female genital mutilation surgery is forbidden in Islam. He calls on ending and banned to \"Female Circumcision\" in some parts of the Muslim world, especially in rural Africa where most still practice it. His views were supported by Sheikhs in Al-Azhar.\n\nQaradawi urged women to not masturbate and elaborated that its dangerous to stick things into the vagina.\n\nOn 5 June 2006, on the Al Jazeera program \"Sharia and Life\", al-Qaradawi (a regular on the program) reiterated orthodox views on homosexuality. When asked about the punishment for people who \"practise liwaat (sodomy) or sihaaq (lesbian activity)\", al-Qaradawi replied: \"The same punishment as any sexual pervert – the same as the fornicator.\" (MEMRI translation). The punishment for fornication is lashing.\n\nIn an interview with \"Der Spiegel\", Qaradawi said that his attitude towards homosexuality is the same as that found in Christianity. In the interview he stated, \"One year ago, there was a demonstration against me in London because I spoke out against homosexuality. People seem to have forgotten that it wasn't me who came up with this mindset. It's part of God's order spoken of by Moses and even mentioned by Jesus.\"\n\nHowever there are rigorous scholarly debates among the Islamic School of Law (Fiqh) as to whether LGBT are define by genetic disorders and that it may be permissible or not for those who're scientifically-medically-proven to be part of the LGBT category as with hermaphrodite denoting whether a person is incline towards the naturality of female or male instinct. Same for Mukhannathun (Transgender), in which there are many prophetic Hadith that allows male who have inclinations towards being female (effeminate) that occurred during the Islamic prophet Muhammad's time and that they were accepted as part of the larger community in Madinah having equal rights. Qaradawi is one of many among the leading Islamic scholars who's in this ongoing debate.\n\nAl-Qaradawi calls \"stoning\" un-Islamic for it has nothing to do with Islam at all but laws made by the religion of Judaism; Jewish Religious Laws. He says there are more than dozens of verses in the Torah that support stoning for adulterers, fornicators, LGBT people, and for many other reasons.\n\nAl-Qaradawi says that honor killing is a tradition that was carried out thousands of years ago by ancient civilization; the Romans, the Dark Ages, Chinese Emperors, etc. He says, it has nothing to do with Islam; neither Qur'an nor Sunnah (Prophetic Hadith). He calls on those who done it to be punishable with death for their crime; a life for a life.\n\nAl-Qaradawi fully supports and advocates Mawlid. He says that to used the birth date of Muhammad in remembrance of his life story is not Bid'ah (Innovation). In fact it's encourage in Islam to do good action (Man Sanna Sunnatun Hassanah) based on a Sahih Hadith. And that Allah (God) himself have said in Al-Qur'an, Chapter 21, Verse 107:\n\nAl-Qaradawi explains that Allah (God) is talking about Muhammad's miracle birth as the verse mentions \"sent you\". In other words, his presence, his birth, his coming. A \"mercy\" (rahmah) to the worlds. Means mercy to all mankind. It means everything; all of his creations (all creatures).\n\nIt's in this Sahih Hadith that Sheikh Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi emphasizes that good innovative actions is strongly encouraged for as long as it doesn't goes against the Sharia (Islamic Law). What more involving religion itself than worldly good deeds like holding an old person's hand while crossing the road guiding him/her to safety and many more. It's encouraging for both. He says these is the true meaning and emphasis of Islam, to be the religion of mercy (rahmah) and to do more good than just good so that others may lead by our good examples and that they may successively follows them till End of Time.\n\nAl-Qaradawi says that Niqab (Veil) is not obligatory in Islam. He has pointed out that a woman's face is not an Awrah. He calls those who don the Niqabs as following tradition and culture before Islam came to Arabia. Those people, be it male or female at that time had to cover their faces from dusty desert and from inhaling dust especially during sandstorm. Al-Azhar's Grand Imam, also an Egyptian Grand Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy have also called out that Niqab has nothing to do with Islam.\n\nAt the same time Qaradawi issued a fatwa (edict) that organ transplant from living to a living person is permissible in Islam but through donation as donation is considered charity. As for a dead person, only when the brain stops, the transplant can then be carried out.\n\nIn April 2008, at a conference in Qatar titled \"Mecca: the Center of the Earth, Theory and Practice\", al-Qaradawi advocated the implementation of Mecca Time to replace the Greenwich Meridian as the basis of the world time zone system.\n\nAl-Qaradawi called for a \"Day of Anger\" over the cartoons, but condemned violent actions in response to them.\n\nAl-Qaradawi is one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy.\n\nAl-Qaradawi said, \"Rushdie disgraced the honor of the Prophet and his family and defiled the values of Islam,\" but he never backed the fatwa calling for his death.\n\nIn 1997, Qaradawi's affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood led to his expulsion from Egypt, a country where this organisation was at the time prohibited.\n\nAl-Qaradawi was a follower of Hasan al-Banna during his youth and a longtime member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He has twice turned down offers to be its leader. In an interview on the Dream channel, al-Qaradawi states the following about his relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB):\n\nOn 16 May 2015 al-Qaradawi has been sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court along with the ousted President Mohamed Morsi and over 100 other Egyptians affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. As reported by the Interpol website, Qaradawi is wanted by the judicial authorities of Egypt for \"Agreement, incitement and assistance to commit intentional murder, helping the prisoners to escape, arson, vandalism and theft.\"\n\nQaradawi has criticised reality TV programs, saying that the aim of these is to 'mislead the [Muslim] nation'.\n\nAl-Qaradawi, a forefront of contemporary Muslim thinkers and scholars. His vast contributions include more than 80 books and hundreds of articles on different Islamic issues, ranging from the fundamental principles and laws of Islam to the needs and challenges of modern Muslim societies. His knowledge, intellect, moderation and unrelenting efforts to bring Islam to a larger audience have gained him the respect of millions of Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide. His famous Television program Ash-Shariah wal-Hayat (Sharia and Life) has an estimated 700-800 million viewers worldwide.\n\nDespite his fame. In 2012, Qardawi traded barbs with fellow Muslim cleric Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri due to what Ibn Aqil perceived as hypocritical positions of Qardawi during the Arab Spring, a charge he denied.\n\nPakistani scholar, Muhammad Taqi Usmani stated, \"There is no doubt that I—as the lowest student of Islamic Fiqh—with my benefitting from the books of the outstanding Dr al-Qaradāwī to a very large extent, and my supreme wonderment at the majority of [his works], have found myself, in some particular issues, not in agreement with him in the results that he has arrived at, but these sorts of differences (ikhtilāf) in views based on juristic judgement (ijtihādī) are natural, and cannot be the [sole] basis for judging [their author] so long as the people of knowledge do not deem [the bearers of such opinions] to be weak intellectually, or in religion, and [in any case] the importance of these books and their value in scholarship and da'wa are not affected by this to even the slightest, most insignificant degree.\"\n\nIn addition, he refers to some modern scholars by writing, \"What we see today, very unfortunately, is that the one who brings forward elevated ideas in his writings and lofty theories in his speech and his sermons often does not rise above the level of the layman\" but exempts Qardawi by saying, \"As for the outstanding, erudite scholar, Dr Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, may God (Most High) preserve him, God (Most High) has indeed made me fortunate enough to accompany him in travels and in residence, and sit with him and closely associate with him in long and repeated meetings. [From this] I found him manifest in his personality exemplary Islamic qualities, for he is a human being before he is a Muslim, and a devoted Muslim before he is a caller to Islam (dā'i), and a caller to Islam before he is a scholar and jurist.\"\n\nThe Doğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı, which supports the Turkistan Islamic Party, attacked Yusuf al-Qaradawi and called his creed \"perverted\" and claimed that he was followed by \"democratic polytheists\". Qaradawi was attacked by Hani Al-Siba'i.\n\nQaradawi stated that Russia is an \"enemy of Islam\" due to the country's military relations with the Syrian regime.\n\nHis remarks drew harsh criticism from Muslims in Russia. According to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, \"Qaradawi's statements had given rise to amazement among the Muslims of Russia.\" Kadyrov asserted that Qaradawi's statements are mainly \"directed against the Muslims of Russia, who are citizens of this country, were born here and live here, and who care about their country\".\n\nKadyrov claimed that \"It is not Russia that is supplying weapons and money for the thousands of mercenaries from all over the world who have flooded Syria and are committing daily terrorist attacks, in which the blood of women, old people and children is shed,\"\n\nAl-Qaradawi has been banned from entering the United States since 1999 and the United Kingdom since 2008, though he visited London in 2004. The lobby group MEMRI said it helped play a role in the measures. In July 2003, he visited Stockholm, Sweden, for a conference at the Stockholm Mosque arranged by the Muslim Association of Sweden. During the conference al-Qaradawi expressed his support for suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, calling the fight against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories a \"necessary Jihad\". France announced in March 2012 it will not let him enter.\n\nThe Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) (citing \"Asharq Al-Awsat\"), alleges that al-Qaradawi issued a Fatwa following the Iraqi insurgency, saying,\n\nAll of the Americans in Iraq are combatants, there is no difference between civilians and soldiers, and one should fight them, since the American civilians came to Iraq in order to serve the occupation. The abduction and killing of Americans in Iraq is a [religious] obligation so as to cause them to leave Iraq immediately. The mutilation of corpses [however] is forbidden in Islam.\n\nAl-Qaradawi, however, denies this allegation:\n\nI have not published a Fatwa on this issue. At the Egyptian Journalists' Union a few days ago I was asked about the permissibility of fighting against the occupation in Iraq, and I answered that it is permitted. Afterwards I was asked concerning the American civilians in Iraq and I merely responded with the question – are there American civilians in Iraq? It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use the word \"killing\" but rather I say \"struggle\", which is a more comprehensive word than the word \"killing\" and whose meaning is not necessarily to kill. In addition, I have condemned the taking of hostages on a number of occasions in the past and have demanded that they be released and that their lives not be threatened.\n\nShaker Al-Nabulsi, a former Muslim who writes for the liberal site Ethal, called for the creation of a petition to the UN calling to put Qaradawi and his like on trial for incitement and support of terrorism.\n\nAl-Qaradawi issued a fatwa in 2008 stating that the consumption of tiny amounts of alcohol (<0.005% concentration or 5/1000) was acceptable for Muslims. The statement was made regarding energy drinks, where fermentation occurs naturally as part of the production process. This does not contradict the widespread view that consuming alcohol is totally forbidden to Muslims. The fermentation in this process is natural and unavoidable, similarly it is an extremely small proportion.\n\nIn October 2004 according to Saudi Arabia's newspaper \"The Arab News\" based in New York and Jeddah, over 2,500 Muslim intellectuals from 23 countries signed a petition addressed to the United Nations to raise awareness on the use of religion for incitement to violence. Al-Qaradawi was mentioned among \"the sheikhs of death,\" as the signatories defined those who manipulate religion to incite violence, for \"providing a religious cover for terrorism.\" A charge al-Qaradawi dismissed as baseless and slanderous. For his stance, he was against Salafism (Wahhabism) extremist ideology culminating from Saudi Arabia itself.\n\nThe sheikh has been banned from entering the U.S. since 1999. In 2008 the UK Home Office stated that al-Qaradawi was denied a visa to enter Britain for medical treatment because of fears that his preaching \"could foster inter-community violence.\" In March 2012 the French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared his decision to block the entry of extremists in the country after the Toulouse attacks, and specifically mentioned al-Qaradawi as one of those barred from entering France.\n\nQaradawi chairs the Union of Good, a coalition of Islamic charities supporting Hamas' infrastructure, an organisation on the US State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations. In December 2014 the International Union of Muslim Scholars led by al-Qaradawi was expelled from the Cairo-based International Islamic Council for Da'wah and Relief based on the allegation that the group mixed religion and politics and supported terrorism.\n\nThe \"Consortium Against Terrorist Finance\" reports that, in 2010, Qaradawi was listed as the chairman of the Sharia supervisory board of Qatar Islamic Bank, one of the Qatari sharia-compliant giants which has allegedly a long history of cooperation with controversial financial entities. He is also a former Sharia adviser and shareholder to Bank al-Taqwa, once listed by the U.S and the UN as a terrorist financier associated with al-Qaeda but delisted in 2010.\n\nAl-Qaradawi was born in Eqypt but lives in Qatar. He has three sons and four daughters, three of whom hold doctorates from British Universities. His daughter, Ilham Yousef Al-Qaradawi, is an internationally recognized nuclear scientist. His son, Abdurrahman Yusuf al-Qaradawi, is a poet and a political activist in Egypt.\n\nAl-Qaradawi has been awarded by various countries and institutions for his contributions to Islamic society. Among them are\n\nThe Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, part of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, instituted the \"Sheikh Yusuf Al Qaradawi Scholarships\" in 2009, awarding them to five students each year for post-graduate studies. It also named after him its newly established research centre, The Qaradawi Center for Islamic Moderation and Renewal.\n\nThe \"State Merit Prize for Islamic Studies\" was issued to Qaradawi by the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage of Qatar on 3 November 2009.\n\nHe is a trustee of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies and has been named as the technical consultant for a multimillion-dollar English-language film about Mohammed, produced by Barrie Osborne. A 2008 \"Foreign Policy\" online poll put him at No.3 in the list of the Top 20 Public Intellectuals worldwide.\n\nAl -Qaradawi has authored more than 120 books and his academic style and objective thought are considered to be some of the main characteristics of his works. His most famous work is \"The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam\". Professor Mustafa al-Zarqa declared that owning a copy of it was \"the duty of every Muslim family\".\n\nHis book \"Fiqh al-Zakat\" is considered by some as the most comprehensive work in the area of zakat. Abul Ala Maududi commented on it as \"the book of this century in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)\"\nThe prominent Deobandi Islamic scholar Muhammad Taqi Usmani, said this about the work:\n\nThe first book that read in its entirety of his works is his valuable book Fiqh al-Zakat, and I benefitted much from this great, encyclopedic, rewarding work through which the author did a great service to the second of the pillars of Islam, in a way that the umma needs today, when it comes to the application of zakat at the level of the individual and the group. Indeed this work manifested the genius of its author, and his inventive methodology, not only in the clarification of issues pertaining to zakat and their compilation, but in stimulating research in contemporary topics that no one before him had touched upon, and basing them upon the principles fiqh and its jurisprudential theory.\n\nHis book \"Fiqh al-Jihad\" has been widely commented on. \"The Guardian\" writes:\n\nThis book has also been analyzed by University of Southern California professor Sherman Jackson and Tunisian Islamist scholar-politician Rachid Ghannouchi.\n\nHis views on jihad have attracted criticism from some hard line groups.\n\nYusuf al-Qaradawi wrote many books, some of which were translated into English:\nAmongst his dozens of works in Arabic, we cite:\n\nHe has also published some excerpts of his poetry in the book \"Nafahat wa Lafahat\". Al-Qaradawi has also been the subject of the book \"The Global Mufti: The Phenomenon of Yusuf al-Qaradawi\" published by Columbia University Press. He is also profiled as one of the leading liberal voices in contemporary Islam in Charles Kurzman's book \"Liberal Islam: A Sourcebook\", published by Oxford University Press.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6487546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6487546", "title": "Zabbaleen", "text": "Zabbaleen\n\nThe Zabbaleen ( ', ) is a word which literally means \"garbage people\" in Egyptian Arabic. The contemporary use of the word in Egyptian Arabic is to mean \"garbage collectors\". In cultural contexts, the word refers to teenagers and adults who have served as Cairo's informal garbage collectors since approximately the 1940s. The Zabbaleen (singular: ', ) are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means \"pig-pen operators.\" The word ' came from the Egyptian Arabic word ' (, ) which means \"garbage\".\n\nSpread out among seven different settlements scattered in the Greater Cairo Urban Region, the Zabbaleen population is between 50,000 and 70,000. The largest settlement is Mokattam village, nicknamed \"Garbage City,\" located at the foot of the Mokattam Mountains, next to Manshiyat Naser. The Zabbaleen community in Mokattam Village has a population of around 20,000 to 30,000, over 90 percent of which are Coptic Christians.\n\nFor several generations, the Zabbaleen supported themselves by collecting trash door-to-door from the residents of Cairo for nearly no charge. Notably, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect, whereas most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect.\n\nThe Zabbaleen use donkey-pulled carts and pick-up trucks to transport the garbage that they collect from the residents of Cairo, transport the garbage to their homes in Mokattam Village, sort the garbage there, and then sell the sorted garbage to middlemen or create new materials from their recycled garbage. The living situation for the Zabbaleen is poor, especially since they live amongst the trash that they sort in their village and with the pigs to which they feed their organic waste. Nevertheless, the Zabbaleen have formed a strong and tight-knit community. However, their existence and way of life has come under threat after the Cairo municipal authorities’ decision in 2003 to award annual contracts of $50 million to three multinational garbage disposal companies.\n\nThe government authorities do not compensate the Zabbaleen for these changes, and as a result, the takeover of waste collection threatens the socio-economic sustainability of the Zabbaleen community. More recently, the Zabbaleen have faced another challenge when the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry ordered the culling of all pigs in April 2009, in response to national fears over the possible spread of H1N1 influenza.\n\nThis governmental decision poses a major setback to the Zabbaleen because pigs are an essential component to their recycling and sorting system, in which the pigs eat all of the organic waste. Immediately after the culling of pigs, observers have noticed a visible increase of trash piles and piles of rotting food on the streets of Cairo. There are also worries that the Egyptian government is seeking to remove the Mokattam village entirely and relocate the Zabbaleen further outside of Cairo by a further 25 km, to a 50-feddan plot (1 feddan = ) in Cairo's eastern desert settlement of Katameya.\n\nAround the 1910s, a group of Muslim migrants from the Dakhla oasis in the Western desert of Egypt relocated to Cairo in an area known as Bab El Bahr, which is situated between Attaba and Ramses square in downtown Cairo. These people are known as the Wahiya (singular: wahi), which means people of the oasis. The Wahiya assumed the sole responsibility for the collection and disposal of Cairo's household waste under the framework of contracts with building owners in Cairo. In this system, the Wahiya paid the owners of buildings an initial sum and then collected monthly fees from the tenants for their services.\n\nIn the 1930s and 40s, there was a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The descendants of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the El Badari district in Asyut, a rural region in Upper Egypt, which is the southern part of Egypt. As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for pig farming. Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970. Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry at the foot of the Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate. Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected. This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means pig pen operators, because they raise pigs that eat the organic components of the waste that they collect.\n\nPrior to the migration of the Zabbaleen, the Wahiya had used the refuse, after drying it, as a source of energy, specifically as fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. However, this use of dried refuse became obsolete in the 1930s when fuel oil became the preferred fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. This coincided with the migration of the Zabbaleen, who used the organic components of the wastes to feed their pigs. Thus, the Wahiya began to sell the organic refuse to the Zabbaleen. Because the Zabbaleen needed to obtain waste food before it rots, they preferred to collect the refuse themselves using their own donkey carts.\n\nTherefore, the Zabbaleen can be distinguished from the Wahiya in at least two significant ways.\n\nFirst, the Wahiya retained control over the access and collection rights to the monthly fees paid by the residents, whereas the Zabbaleen usually do not have a share in the monthly fees paid by residents. In fact, the Zabbaleen are often obliged to pay the Wahiya in order to gain access to the waste garbage. However, what the Zabbaleen do acquire are the rights to the refuse itself. Hence, the relationship between the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen was hierarchically constituted. The Wahiya acted as the middlemen between the Zabbaleen and Cairo's households. Quoting Assaad, \"The wahiya assume overall responsibility for regular removal of the wastes \"vis-à-vis\" residents and building owners and are responsible for collection of the wastes from individual dwelling units to the street level. The Zabbaleen, on the other hand, are responsible for the haulage and disposal of the wastes.\"\nSecond, the Zabbaleen are the group that actually collects the garbage on donkey-pulled carts, separate out recyclables, breed pigs, an important component of their recycling system, and engage in a highly efficient process of recycling, whereas the Wahiya do not. The Zabbaleen also sell the sorted secondary materials such as paper, tin, glass, plastic materials, rags, and aluminum cans to intermediaries. Because Cairenes are generally not aware of the distinction between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the informal economy of collecting Cairo's municipal solid waste (MSW). In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize the refuse collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989. Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time. The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades.\n\nThe municipal authorities grew increasingly intolerant of the Zabbaleen's donkey carts, which, according to Assaad, were considered an eyesore and a traffic hazard by the government. This was precisely in the neighborhoods that were being more fully served given Cairo's narrow, winding streets that are not wide-enough for large garbage trucks. Regardless, in the early 1990s, according to Fahmi & Sutton, the garbage collectors had to comply with the municipality's requirements to use motorized trucks, rather than donkey carts, as the authorities introduced a system of mechanization to transport solid waste. Because the Zabbaleen were required to accommodate to these new requirements for a mechanized system without any government support, including technical, financial, or educational support, they resorted to the selling of small plots of land back in their ancestral villages, use of personal savings, or credit loans to acquire the necessary capital to purchase the trucks. According to Fahmi, within the EPC, the Wahiya conducted administration, marketed the company's services, collected the fees from tenants, and supervised service deliveries. On the other end, the Zabbaleen, \"many of whom might otherwise have been homeless and without employment, collected and transported the waste.\" In more recent years, as the Zabbaleen became more involved in the work, some received a minimal fee from the Wahiya.\n\nThere are seven main settlements, in which the Zabbaleen reside in the Greater Cairo Urban Region: Ein El Sira, Moatamdia, El Bargil, Tora, Ezbet el Nakhl, Helwan, and Mokattam. Due to urban expansion, most of these 7 settlements have been moved by municipal authorities to more peripheral locations. The number of Zabbaleen living in these areas total to about 60,000-70,000. Of these settlements, Mokattam, also often known as Garbage City, east of Cairo, is the largest settlement, situated at the foot of Mokattam mountain, with approximately 20,000 inhabitants. The Zabbaleen Settlement of Mokattam was created as a result of a series of evictions from the Imbaba area located in the Giza governorate, notably when the Zabbaleen were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970.\n\nAlthough Mokattam village is relatively close to the center of Cairo, it is very inaccessible because it is situated on a plateau surrounded by the cliffs of the Mokattam hills on one side and by the Manshiet Nasser squatter settlement on the other side. Vehicular access to the Zabbaleen Mokattam is possible only through three entrances, two of which are accessible only by crossing through the crowded, narrow, and steep streets of Manshiet Nasser. Because of the high congestion and road traffic, conflicts between the residents of the Manshiet Nasser settlement and the Zabbaleen, who need to haul their donkey carts loaded with garbage through the streets of Manshiet Nasser have often broken out. Occasionally, these conflicts took on religious overtones, as the inhabitants of the Manshiet Nasser settlement are mostly Muslims, whereas the inhabitants of the Mokattam settlement are mostly Coptic Christians.\n\nMokattam village is situated at the foot of the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people. More recently, in 2008, another rock slide from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another shantytown in the Mokattam district. These rock slides have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen. Some attribute these frequent rock slides to various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.\n\nThe living conditions in Mokattam Village, and the other Zabbaleen settlements, are poor. According to Assad, in the 1970s, “the streets were so stacked with heaps of assorted refuse that some of them could not be located. The air was heavily polluted by the smoke generated from fires that were either lit deliberately to dispose of unwanted waste, or resulted from the spontaneous combustion of organic residues.” There have been frequent fires in Mokattam, two of which were particularly severe and devastated the settlement in the 1970s. In its early years, the Mokattam Settlement lacked basic services; there were no health centers, pharmacies, or schools. Basic amenities such as piped water, sewage networks, and electricity were also missing. During the beginning decades of the Mokattam settlement, the community suffered from “high mortality and morbidity rates (especially among children), poor environmental conditions, and low income.” In 1983, the average household income per month was estimated at LE 70(approximately US$11.50 in January 2005) within the lowest 10th percentile of national urban income levels, with an average large household size of 8 persons. However, the living conditions of the Mokattam settlement improved after the Mokattam settlement received significant funding from the World Bank, in its upgrading program known as the Zabbaleen Environmental Development Program (ZEDP) in 1981 and from other international donors.\n\nThe Zabbaleen community is characterized by both low health and high rates of disease, especially those related to their garbage collecting activities. According to Assad, \"reported infant mortality rates, particularly from tetanus, were extremely high. In 1981, infant mortality was estimated at about 240 deaths per thousand births (EQI Report #3, 1981: 36).\" This infant mortality rate dropped to 117 per thousand in 1991, but the infant mortality rate in the Mokattam community is still substantially higher than the average infant mortality rate of Cairo for the 1990-95 period, which was 45.6 per thousand.\n\nEgypt is a Muslim-majority country. However, over 90 percent of the Zabbaleen community in the Mokattam village are Coptic Christians. Communities where almost everyone is Christian are rare to find in Egypt outside of the Zabbaleen community of Mokattam. According to Engi Wassef, in her commentary in her documentary film \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\", many people in the Zabbaleen village say that even if they could live outside of the village or buy a house elsewhere, they would not because they are happy to live within their own religious community and freely practice their religion.\n\nThe local Coptic Church in Mokattam Village was established in 1975. After the establishment of the church, the Zabbaleen felt more secure in their location and only then began to use more permanent building materials, such as stone and bricks, for their homes. Given their previous experience of eviction from Giza in 1970, the Zabbaleen had lived in temporary tin huts up till that point. In 1976, a large fire broke out in Manshiyat Nasir, which led to the beginning of the construction of the first church below the Mokattam mountain on a site of 1,000 square meters. More churches have been built into the caves found in Mokattam. Currently, there are seven cave churches hidden among the caves of Mokattam Mountain. The Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner is the largest and it has an amphitheater with a seating capacity of 20,000. This church is the largest church in the Middle East. It is named after the Coptic Saint, Simon the Tanner, who lived at the end of the 10th century, when Egypt was ruled by the Muslim Fatimid Caliph Al-Muizz Lideenillah. Simon the Tanner is the Coptic Saint who is associated with the legend of the moving of the Mokattam Mountain. Adjacent churches to the Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner include the St. Bola's Church, St. Marks Church, and St. Simon the Tanner's Hall. The cave churches of Mokattam are also a point of interest for many tourists visiting Cairo.\n\nMany sources state that the Zabbaleen have created one of the most efficient recycling systems in the world, which recycles up to 80 percent of all the waste that they collect. In contrast, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. According to Fahmi, 2005, \"it was estimated that, in 1997, the Zabbaleen informally handled one-third of the garbage of Cairo’s 14 million people, mainly that from poorer districts,\" meaning that the Zabbaleen collected up to 3,000 tons of garbage every day. The Zabbaleen are able to recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect through their family-run micro-enterprises that generate jobs, including those for production of handmade crafts from rags and paper, and incomes from some 40,000 people. In fact, according to Fahmi, \"in the mid-1990s, nearly 700 Zabbaleen families owned collection enterprises, 200 owned and operated small- and medium-scale recycling enterprises, and 120 owned trading enterprises, in addition to maintenance workshops and community-based service businesses.\" What is distinctive about the Zabbaleen from many other urban informal waste collecting-groups that scavenge trash for useful products is that the Zabbaleen invest heavily in their tools and know-how for recycling. These Zabbaleen micro-entrepreneurs have invested \"an estimated 2.1 million Egyptian pounds (LE) (US $ 1⁄4 LE 6.19 -May 2004 rates) in trucks, plastic granulators, paper compactors, cloth grinders, aluminium smelters, and tin processors.\" By investing in such infrastructure, the Zabbaleen continually upgraded and enhanced their methods of recycling plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, and fabrics. Thus, the city of Cairo and its administration had been able to manage its solid waste at almost no cost to the municipal administration because of such efforts by the Zabbaleen. Hence, the income that the Zabbaleen generate is mainly derived from their recycling and sorting activities, not from the minimal fees (LE 2-4) that they collect from residents.\n\nThere is a gender division of labor in the process of collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household. This trash is completely unsorted because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10. The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip that may take anywhere from between 10 minutes to an hour.\n\nWhen the men return to the village with the collected trash, usually their families are waiting for them so that they can begin sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables. The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage. First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different types of plastic are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories. Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a marginal profit.\n\nThe initial and very integral step of sorting the trash is the responsibility of Zabbaleen community members who own pigs. The pigs are fed the organic waste. After the organic waste has been eaten by the pigs, the rest of the trash is sorted into different categories such, as PT plastic, paper, cans, etc. Thus, as Engi Wassef, the director of \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\" notes, \"One of the reasons why Coptic Christians are given a kind of monopoly status on the garbage collection and sorting system is because the Muslim religion does not allow for breeding or eating or living near pigs. It's considered a dirty animal.\"\n\nIn addition to their use in sorting out organic waste, pigs are an important source of income. After the pigs have grown, the Zabbaleen sell the pig-meat to large tourist facilities. According to Fahmi and Sutton, \"Hitherto, the Zabbaleen claimed to collect 6,000 tons of MSW a day, of which 60% was food waste and organic garbage which their pigs consume. Every 6 months, the waste collectors sell adult pigs, 5 to 15 pigs to a trader for LE 7 per kilogram (US$ 1.25 per kilogram). The trader then takes pigs to the slaughterhouses, where a kilogram is sold for LE 30–35 (US$ 5–6.25). The waste collectors can earn around LE 450 (US$ 80) per pig.\"\n\nAfter the sorting of materials is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, in the creation of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\", PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, is one of the most highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re-sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.\n\nThe official website of the documentary \"Garbage Dreams\" states that, \"Far ahead of any modern 'Green' initiatives, the Zabbaleen survive by recycling 80 percent of the garbage they collect.\" By comparison, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. After the takeover of the municipal waste collection, the three private companies, two from Spain and one from Italy, that were awarded with contracts to dispose of Cairo's trash were only required to recycled 20 percent of the trash that they collect. The rest of the trash that foreign companies do not recycle are placed into new landfills. The efficiency and environmental-friendliness of the Zabbaleen \"waste collection and recycling system received major world recognition and approval at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.\" The Mega-Cities Project sought to encourage the Zabbaleen system of waste collection and recycling as a model to be encouraged in other developing world cities such as Manila and Mumbai. The Zabbaleen waste collection system has received international funding from the World Bank, the Ford Foundation and Oxfam for specific projects to upgrade and improve the recycling of solid waste.\n\nIn 2003, the government of Egypt sold annual contracts reaching US$50 million to international companies to collect Cairo's solid waste. The three companies that were awarded with contracts for cleaning Cairo are FCC and Urbaser, Enser (both Spanish companies), and AMA (an Italian) company. The Egyptian Company for Garbage Collection, a domestic company was also awarded with contracts. There was a precedent for this approach to trash collection two years earlier, in 2001, when the government agreed to sign a contract with Onyx, a French company, to manage the waste of Alexandria, the second largest city in Egypt. Through this contract, the Egyptian government agreed to pay $446 million to Onyx for the treatment of one million tons of waste per year for 15 years, a sum that was ten times greater than what the government had previously paid before for its municipal waste management.\n\nSignificantly, the foreign companies, despite the large value of their contracts, are only required to recycle 20 percent of the waste that they collect; the remaining 80 percent are placed into landfills. In contrast, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 percent of all the MSW that they collect. The foreign companies collected the trash from garbage bins placed at central collection points on the streets. However, many inhabitants of Cairo preferred the door-to-door garbage pick-up done by the Zabbaleen, especially because the bins were not plentifully located or located in inconvenient places. Thus, residents expressed their discontent with the new system, especially because they were being charged more for what seemed to be a more inconvenient system. Under the new system, residents were required to pay a monthly bill for garbage collection that accompanies their electricity bill. The garbage collection fee was based upon the percentage of each electricity bill so that the garbage collection fee increases proportionately to electricity consumption. Two years after the new system was imposed, Rashed writes in the Al-Ahram Weekly, \"residents of the governorate have been voicing increasingly vociferous complaints that the companies are working well below full capacity. The streets are not as clean as they were during the first days of the privatisation. Both company workers, and garbage receptacles, appear to be increasingly thin on the ground.\"\n\nThe subcontracting of MSW collection to foreign companies had an immediate negative impact upon the Zabbaleen community as documented in Mai Iskander's film, Garbage Dreams. Contracting out MSW to foreign companies meant that the Zabbaleen would lose access to garbage, which was the basis of their recycling and sorting activities. In the documentary Garbage Dreams, Laila, a social worker in Mokattam Village, says, \"The city contracted with foreign waste disposal companies because they perceived the Zabbaleen to be old-fashioned. But they didn't come tell us, \"You need to modernize your ways.\" This was all done behind our backs. \"we're replacing you with the companies.\" So we can be like the developed countries.\" In contrast, because officials from the Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Authority (CCBA) regarded the Zabbaleen recycling methods as unhygienic and backwards, they were optimistic about the process and hoped for a positive impact on Cairo's environment. However, because the mechanized equipment of the foreign companies are too large for the streets of Cairo, citizens were required to bring their trash to designated collection centers and bins, which were not always placed in easily accessible locations. Therefore, residents preferred to continue to have their trash picked up from their doors by the Zabbaleen, who were able to come directly to their doors even if their homes were located in narrow alleys. Eventually, the foreign companies realized that they needed the Zabbaleen and thus, subcontracted them. This system failed, however, because the companies underpaid the Zabbaleen. According to Fahmi and Sutton, \"while company sources mention salaries ranging between LE 300 to LE 450 per month (US $50–$75), some Zabbaleen claim that the salaries on offer are actually closer to LE 150 per month.\" One Zabbal with eight children gave a similar figure: whereas he used to make LE 10 a day (US $1.60), foreign contractors offered him LE 5 a day.\n\nIn April 2009, the first cases of the H1N1 influenza were found in Mexico. By the end of that month, it was estimated that up to 169 people died due to the epidemic.\nAll of the deaths, except for one, occurred in Mexico. Egypt responded to this outbreak of H1N1 by ordering the culling of its swine population, an act which had a devastating impact on the livelihood of 70,000 Zabbaleen families. This decision was made not by the Health Ministry, but directly by the Parliament. International organizations, including the United Nations criticized the Egyptian government for its decision. Egypt was the only country in the world to take such a drastic decision as to cull an estimated 300,000 pigs. This decision was made despite the general agreement that H1N1 is not transmitted by pigs. Furthermore, there were no cases of swine flu found in Egypt during the time when the pig cull was executed. The actual slaughter of the pigs was ordered by the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry in April 2009. Although government authorities stated that the slaughtering itself was humane, and in accordance with Islamic law, witnesses testify a lot of cruelty and violence in the culling. According to Slackman, \"Piglets were documented being stabbed and tossed into piles, large pigs beaten with metal rods, their carcasses dumped in the sand.\" H1N1 influenza was officially declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in June 2009. The pandemic was then declared to be officially over by the World Health Organization on August 10, 2010.\n\nWhen first ordering the pig cull, the Egyptian government asserted that it was a precaution to forestall national fears of the imminent pandemic. Later, after the pig cull, the government stated that its decision to order the pig cull was directly affected by the global breakout of H5N1 virus, more commonly known as bird flu, several years earlier and a fear that the two strains of viruses could possibly combine to form a more lethal virus. Later, the Egyptian government openly stated that the pig cull was no longer just an act to prevent swine flu; rather, it was part of a plan to clean up the Zabbaleen and allow them to live in sanitary conditions. According to Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal, chief of the infectious disease department in the Ministry of agriculture, \"We want them to live a better life. humanely treated; it's a very difficult life.\" In contrast to the explanations officially given by the Egyptian government, many other observers, especially in the Western media, as well as the Zabbaleen themselves perceived a religious bias in the execution of the pig cull. In a New York Times article, Slackman asserted that, \"The Zabbaleen are Christians. Egypt is a majority Muslim country. The Zabbaleen are convinced that the government wants to use the swine flu scare not to help improve their lives but to get pigs out of Egypt. Islam prohibits eating pork.\" In another New York Times article, Audi writes, \"Most of Egypt's pig farmers are Christians, and some accuse the government of using swine flu fears to punish them economically.\" According to Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, a priest from a Zabbaleen neighborhood, \"The bottom line is pigs are not welcome in Egypt.\" In an article by the BBC, Fraser argues along a similar line, saying that the Coptic Christian minority were targeted by the government for a main source of their income, the rearing of pigs. A similar opinion is voiced by Engi Wassef in her documentary, \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\". Fahmi and Sutton echo a similar explanation: \"The adverse effect of the slaughtering of the pigs on the Zabbaleen's livelihoods might be part of the ongoing gentrification of garbage city for land speculations and the taking over of their recycling economy by entrepreneurial businesses.\"\n\nThe pig cull negatively affected the Zabbaleen in several ways. First, because the pigs eat the organic waste, they are a vital component in their recycling system, the pig cull literally destroyed the Zabbaleen recycling system. Deprived of their pig herds, the Zabbaleen stopped collecting such organic trash, leaving food piles to rot in the streets, leading to the increase of trash in the streets. According to Engi Wassef, recycling and sorting activities in the Zabbaleen villages all but ceased after the pig cull, because without the pigs, the sorting and recycling activities of the Zabbaleen became economically unfeasible. Less trash was brought into the village, because there was no place to put the trash. Hence, the entire recycling system was broken, placing the Zabbaleen out of work.\n\nAnother negative effect of the pig cull on the Zabbaleen was the loss of the economic value of the pigs themselves. According to Fahmi and Sutton, pigs are the main source of income for the Zabbaleen. Before the cull, the Zabbaleen had collected 6,000 tons of MSW daily, of which 60 percent was organic waste which was consumed by the pigs. Every six months, the Zabbaleen would take their pigs to traders, earning around 450LE (approximately 80 USD) per pig. Although the Egyptian government made financial compensations for some of pigs slaughtered; compensations were not given to all of the Zabbaleen who lost pigs to the cull and those who received compensation received far less money compared to what they would have received from selling the pigs to traders. According to one Zabbaleen pig breeder, \"The government paid me between LE 50 (US$ 10) and LE 250 (US$ 50) for each pig I lost, depending on its size, whilst meat processors would have given me as much as LE 1,000 (US$ 200).\" The pig cull also resulted in increased cases of malnutrition and anaemia in Zabbaleen children because prior to the cull, pork had been the only affordable source of animal protein for most of the Zabbaleen.\n\nMany observers noticed an immediate increase in piles of trash on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull. Because in the Zabbaleen system of recycling, it is the pigs who initially eat the organic waste, the pig cull had a negative effect on the cleanliness of Cairo's streets. According to Khalil in an article by Al Masry Al Youm, \"The elimination of the pigs prompted more trash than usual to immediately start clogging the streets of the capital.\" In a New York Times article from September 2009, Slackman states that the Egyptian government was warned before its actual execution that the pig cull, if executed, \"the city would be overwhelmed with trash.\" Slackman notes that after the pig cull, \"rotting food piles up on the streets of middle-class neighborhoods like Heliopolis and in the poor streets of communities like Imbaba.\" In an article by Bloomberg, Williams also observes a garbage crisis piling up on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull. This piling up of organic MSW became hazardous because the organic waste then became a source of infectious diseases and led to an increase of rat infestation.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
