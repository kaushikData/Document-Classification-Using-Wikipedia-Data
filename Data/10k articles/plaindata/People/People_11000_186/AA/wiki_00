{"id": "17807744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17807744", "title": "Billy Thompson (gunman)", "text": "Billy Thompson (gunman)\n\nBilly Thompson, sometimes known as Texas Billy Thompson (1845 – September 6, 1897) was an Old West gunman and gambler, and the younger brother of the famous gunman and lawman Ben Thompson. The younger Thompson brother never achieved the fame that his brother achieved, and in his own lifetime was mainly referred to as the unpredictable and troubled younger brother of Ben Thompson. Factually, however, while a dangerous man, he also was a formidable opponent in a gunfight.\n\nBorn William Thompson in Knottingley, Yorkshire, England, immigrating with his family and older brother to the United States as a child. His family settled in Texas, and during the American Civil War, both his brother and he volunteered for the Confederate Army. His older brother went on to fame as a gunman and later as a lawmen and chief of police for Austin, Texas. Ben Thompson was more stable than his younger brother, having an even temperament, albeit accompanied by a deadly side if need be. Known as having a violent and quick temper, the younger Thompson often found himself in trouble, usually from violence.\n\nHis first known gunfight was on March 31, 1868. That day, while attending a fist fight between a White man and an African American man, a US soldier named William Burke became upset that the townspeople favored the black man, this being partly because the army was seen by locals as an occupying force following the war. When he lashed out verbally at Billy, the two argued, then later Burke apologized, asking to buy Billy a drink. The two men spent two hours drinking, then went to a bordello together. They argued a few times over minor things during their time together, but for the most part, they seemed to have gotten along. After they entered the bordello, Billy Thompson went upstairs with a prostitute, and for reasons unknown, William Burke again flared his temper against Thompson, and began walking the halls shouting threats against him. Finding the room in which Billy had entered, Burke kicked in the door armed with a pistol, and after the two exchanged shots, Burke fell badly wounded, and died the next day. Feeling he would certainly hang for killing a soldier, Thompson fled.\n\nThompson quickly ran out of money, and sent word to his older brother, a habit he would never break. Two months after the Burke killing, while in Rockport, Texas, Billy Thompson killed another man, Remus Smith, and again fled to avoid arrest. In that instance, Smith, an 18-year-old stable hand, slapped Billy's horse when it tried to nose in on some feed, which enraged Thompson. When he yelled at the boy, Smith, who was unarmed, told him to take off his pistols and come on, at which point Billy Thompson drew his gun and shot the boy twice. Remus Smith was well liked in the area, and some of the county residents hunted for Billy Thompson for the remainder of his lifetime.\n\nFor five years, he stayed on the run, often contacting his brother to help him with money. On April 18, 1873, Billy Thompson checked into the Grand Central Hotel in Ellsworth, Kansas. His older brother Ben joined him two months later, and the two set themselves up in the saloon, Joe Brennan’s, as house gamblers. At the time, Ellsworth was an extremely busy cattle town. Sheriff Chauncey Whitney was both well liked in the county, and extremely effective as a lawman. Within a short time of their arrival in town, both Thompson brothers became good friends with Whitney, but at the same time, often had bad experiences with local police officer John \"Happy Jack\" Morco. Officer Morco was well known for his boasting about how many men he had killed, often heard to say he had shot 12 men dead.\n\nOn June 30, 1873, Morco arrested Billy Thompson for carrying a weapon in town limits. Though angered, Thompson paid his fine. On August 15, 1873, Billy Thompson was drinking heavily, and had become extremely intoxicated and vocal. Sheriff Whitney had planned to leave town that day with his family, but feeling Billy might get himself into trouble, he chose to remain in town. That day, Ben Thompson introduced John Sterling into a high-stakes game, on the pretense that due to his introduction, Thompson would take a percentage of any winnings. When Sterling left the saloon with over $1,000, without offering Ben Thompson his share, the latter sought him out. He found Sterling in another saloon, in the company of John Morco.\n\nWhen Thompson demanded his cut of the winnings, Sterling, aware that Thompson was unarmed, slapped him. John Morco then pulled his pistol and backed Thompson away. Morco and Sterling then stood outside the saloon, yelling for Ben Thompson to come out and fight. Billy Thompson, hearing of his brother's troubles, ran to help him. Both brothers armed themselves, and walked out into the street. Hearing of the trouble, Sheriff Whitney responded, unarmed, and confronted the Thompsons, imploring them to accompany him for a drink and talk the situation over, to which they agreed.\n\nAs they walked to Brennan's, Morco and Sterling moved to intercept them. When another Texan yelled a warning to Ben Thompson, the latter turned and fired a rifle shot at the pair, and heard his brother fire his shotgun from behind him. Turning, Ben Thompson saw his friend Sheriff Whitney wither to the ground, shot. Believed to have been accidental, Billy Thompson did not rush to flee. Ben Thompson, upon seeing what had happened, stated, \"My God Billy, you have shot your best friend\", to which Billy responded, \"I'm sorry\", followed by Whitney stating, \"He did not intend to do it, it was an accident, send for my family\". According to later witnesses, Billy Thompson was not looking at Whitney, as Whitney was standing to his side, and had his shotgun cocked, with one barrel suddenly going off.\n\nIn later versions of that shooting, it was said his response to his brother Ben, when the latter said, \"you've shot your best friend\", was, \"I'd have shot him if he'd been Jesus Christ\". That never happened, nor was it ever said, a fact verified by witnesses years later at his trial. It would be the main fact of Billy Thompson's life that over the decades since has become completely distorted from what actually happened. However, rumors such as that fueled his notoriety, in the shadow of his older brother's fame.\n\nDespite the shooting being accidental, Ben Thompson forced Billy on a horse and ordered him to flee town, but instead of riding fast, he simply rode slowly through, yelling for anyone who wanted to fight to come get him. Ben feared, probably wisely, that regardless of the circumstances surrounding the shooting, Billy would be lynched. Sheriff Whitney died on August 18, 1873, resulting in a $500 reward being placed on Billy Thompson. Morco and Officer Ed Hogue ran Neil Cain, a Texas cowboy and friend to the Thompson brothers, out of town at gun point.\n\nJohn \"Happy Jack\" Morco was fired over his having instigated the trouble, but not before he issued a warrant against Ben Thompson for assault, resulting in officer Ed Hogue arresting Ben. A short time later, the town council dismissed the entire police force, replacing it with new personnel. Citizens vocally expressed their anger toward visiting Texas cowboys in town from cattle drives. Town Marshal Ed Crawford instigated a dispute, then beat one Texas cowboy, Cad Pierce, to death with his pistol during an arrest, after first shooting him in the side, and groups of vigilantes roamed the streets looking to run out of town any Texans they found causing trouble.\n\nNot long after the Whitney killing, Morco, during a rant of boasting during a dispute with one Texan, was shot and killed by newly appointed Ellsworth police officer J. C. Brown in front of the Lizzie Palmer Dancehall. Ed Crawford was shot and killed a short time afterward by friends of Pierce, and Ed Hogue left town. With the shooting deaths of Sheriff Whitney and Remus Smith, Thompson became known as the troubled and dangerous younger brother of Ben Thompson, although this was not exactly the truth. With the exception of Remus Smith, which was a clear case of cold-blooded murder, his other two shootings had been one in self defense and another accidental.\n\nFor the next several years, Billy Thompson lived on the run from lawmen and bounty hunters. The Aransas County, Texas, Sheriffs Office regularly sent out warrants to Texas lawmen around the state, seeking Thompson for the murder of Remus Smith. In June 1874, Billy Thompson narrowly escaped capture in Austin, Texas. Later that same year, he was captured in Mountain City, Texas, but escaped and fled to San Antonio, Texas, where he entered the Long Horse brothel with a friend. While there, he hit a prostitute across the face, fleeing when two city police officers responded, resulting in a foot pursuit in which he again escaped.\n\nHe avoided lawmen for another two years, until Texas Ranger Captain John Sparks caught up to him in October, 1876, in Travis County, Texas. Sparks was leading a small Ranger unit that was actually seeking rancher Neal Cain for cattle rustling. While raiding the Cain ranch, they came into contact with Billy Thompson. Ben Thompson was notified of his brother's arrest, and immediately sought an attorney to represent him. Ben Thompson also notified Aransas County, in the hopes that they would extradite him to stand trial for that murder, rather than being sent to Kansas.\n\nA number of Ben Thompson's allies boarded a train in Corsicana, Texas, and word of this was passed to Ranger Sparks. By this time, Ranger Sparks was feeling that an attempt would be made to free his prisoner by friends of Ben Thompson, so while in Dallas County, Texas, he requested additional guards from the county sheriff, and received several. With this overwhelming show of force, all rescue attempts to keep Billy Thompson out of Kansas were thwarted. Initially, the town of Ellsworth sought to have Billy jailed in Salina, Kansas, feeling the jail there was more secure. However, with several more Thompson partisans showing up in town, the decision was made instead to house him at Leavenworth.\n\nBen Thompson hired local Kansas attorney Robert Gill to represent Billy. He later added Captain J. D. Mohler, Phillip T. Pendelton, and A. H. Case to the legal team. Court convened on September 3, 1874, with Judge John Prescott presiding. The prosecution had over a dozen witnesses to the shooting, while the defense had only six, one of whom was from Texas, with the other five being from Kansas. As it turned out, the defense witness William Purdy, from Atchison County, Kansas, emerged as the most dependable witness presented.\n\nPurdy, standing nearby, was an eye witness to the shooting, and heard clearly everything said by all those involved. His testimony was;\n\n\"Billy was standing still or trying to do so, as he was intoxicated. He had his eyes fixed on the party advancing on Ben and him. The shot of Ben did not stop them and they continued the same as before, and when being within about 20 feet of Billy Thompson, his gun being down below his breast, it went off, one barrel of it only, and the shot took effect on the shoulder and side of Whitney. Billy's gun was cocked, he did not bring the gun up, took no aim, nor was he looking at Whitney, who stood at his left. As the gun discharged, Ben said, 'My God Billy you have shot your best friend', Billy replied, 'I'm sorry', Whitney said, 'He did not intend to do it, it was an accident, send for my family'. There was no indication at any time that Whitney and the Thompson's weren't on the best of terms.\"\n\nOthers also testified of Whitney's statement after being shot, with the only difference being that some said he stated, \"send for my wife and child\" rather than \"for my family\". The prosecution objected many times, claiming certain things were \"irrelevant\" or hearsay, but they did not object to Whitney's dying declaration. A rumor that Billy Thompson stated after the shooting, \"I'd have shot him if he were Jesus Christ\", rather than \"I'm sorry\", was never mentioned, nor did it ever happen.\n\nIn a trial that lasted nine days, Billy Thompson was acquitted. Although that case was proven to have been accidental, amazingly, he was not held to be extradited to Aransas County, Texas, for the clear-cut murder of Remus Smith, but instead was released. For the next three years, his whereabouts were mostly rumors, but he is known to have arrived in Dodge City, Kansas, in May 1878. He is known to have been arrested by lawman Mart Duggan in Leadville, Colorado, in December 1879, for disturbing the peace, serving only one night in jail. Aransas County, in the meantime, continued its pursuit of him.\n\nOn June 21, 1880, Billy Thompson was in Ogallala, Nebraska. A saloon owner named Bill Tucker and he had developed strong resentment for one another, supposedly over the affections of a prostitute named \"Big Alice\". Billy Thompson, drunk, stood in front of the saloon and fired two shots inside. The second of the shots hit Tucker in the hand, taking off one finger and mutilating others. Enraged, Tucker grabbed a shotgun and ran after the now-fleeing Billy. Tucker fired two shots, missing, reloaded and fired two more, this time riddling Billy Thompson in the back, from his heels to his neck. Billy Thompson was arrested, but allowed to remain under guard at the Ogallala House Hotel to heal. Knowing his brother Ben's reputation, the local sheriff ordered a heavy guard.\n\nBen Thompson, hearing of his brother's arrest, felt his intervening would result in bloodshed. Instead, he asked his friend Bat Masterson to travel to Ogllala to see if he could assist. Masterson did so, first meeting with Billy, then meeting with the ailing Tucker, who was bitter, but willing to drop charges, for a price. Unfortunately, Ben Thompson did not have access to the amount Tucker wanted, so Bat Masterson eluded the guards and helped Billy escape, with them taking a train south. After the escape, a Keith County, Nebraska, grand jury indicted Billy for assault with intent to kill. Those charges were eventually dropped, and the matter forgotten.\n\nOn October 23, 1882, Texas Ranger Captain George W. Baylor captured Billy for the Remus Smith murder in El Paso, Texas, and turned him over to the El Paso County Sheriff, where he was remanded to the custody of Deputy Frank Manning to be returned to Rockport. Foolishly, Deputy Manning allowed Billy Thompson a night of freedom before his return, on the pretense he would return the next morning. He did not. On May 10, 1883, Aransas County Deputy P.P. Court captured Thompson in Arkansas, and finally he was returned to stand trial for the Smith murder.\n\nHowever, it had been 15 years since the murder. Witnesses were sparse, and facts distorted due to poor records, with all of the lawmen who were serving at the time having long since moved on. The trial took only one day, with Thompson being acquitted. This was the one killing committed by Billy Thompson that should have been an iron-clad case of murder, but due to the many years that had passed, the prosecution could not prove their case. The case against him for the murder of soldier William Burke had never been pressed, with the general feeling that it was self defense. For the first time since his first killing, Billy Thompson was not wanted by the law for anything.\n\nOn March 11, 1884, his older brother Ben Thompson was killed in San Antonio, Texas, in what became referred to as the Vaudeville Theater Ambush. For a time, newspapers speculated that Billy Thompson would seek revenge for his brother's death, but he never did. He roamed for a number of years, making his living as a gambler, and is believed to have never held any other employment, passing through Cripple Creek, Colorado, and often spending long periods in Houston and Galveston, Texas.\n\nHe died of a stomach ailment in Houston, on September 6, 1897. At the time of his death, Billy Thompson had killed four men, and wounded a fifth, with one killing being the shooting of the unarmed Remus Smith, another the accidental shooting of Sheriff Chauncey Whitney, and the other two killings and one wounding being during gunfights.\n\nThe role of Thompson was played by the character actor Hal Baylor in a 1955 episode of the ABC/Desilu Western television series, \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", with Hugh O'Brian in the title role. Denver Pyle played Ben Thompson in eight \"Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\" episodes, which aired from 1955 to 1961.\n\n"}

He was a medieval knight created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Joe Maneely.\n\nMarvel Comics' first Black Knight, Sir Percy of Scandia, first appeared in the medieval-adventure series \"Black Knight\" #1-5 (May-Dec. 1955) from Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor to Marvel Comics. The five-issue series was written by Stan Lee, with art by Joe Maneely in the first three interiors and all five covers. Fred Kida and the team of penciller Syd Shores and inker Christopher Rule drew stories in the latter two issues.\n\nSir Percy appeared in Mystic Arcana, representing the element of earth.\n\nThe original Black Knight is Sir Percy of Scandia, a 6th-century knight who serves at the court of King Arthur Pendragon as his greatest warrior and one of the Knights of the Round Table. Recruited by the wizard Merlin, Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be totally incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the Ebony Blade, which Merlin forged from a meteorite. A constant foe of the evil knight Mordred the Evil (Arthur's traitorous \"nephew\") and Morgan le Fay, in time Sir Percy retired his dual identity and married Lady Rosamund.\n\nPercy is eventually killed at Castle Scandia by Mordred during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade made of the same material as his own Ebony Blade - although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur during the Battle of Camlann earlier that day. Merlin ensures that Percy's spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return.\n\nSir Percy was survived by a son, Geoffrey. Lady Rosamund later gave birth to his second son, Edward the Posthumous, who reportedly became ancestor of \"a proud lineage\". Several of Sir Percy's descendants adopted the identity of the Black Knight: Sir Raston, active during the late 6th and early 7th century, who eventually became an agent of the time traveler Kang the Conqueror; and Sir Eobar Garrington, a 12th-century knight serving under Richard the Lionheart during the Third Crusade.\n\nPercy's spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, Dane Whitman. He first appeared as a ghost to act as a mentor to Dane, revealing the circumstances of his death, and appeared a number of times subsequently as a ghost, summoned to give advice. Percy was eventually released from the mortal plane by Doctor Strange.\n\nHis spirit again appeared to Dane Whitman, revealing how he wed Lady Rosamund. His spirit then took possession of Dane's body. With Doctor Strange, he fought Morgan le Fay and Balor, and was rescued by Valkyrie. He then made Sean Dolan his squire. His spirit then took possession of the Ebony Blade itself.\n\nThe Black Knight was an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He was a master of swordsmanship, horseback riding and all forms of combat known in Britain at the time of Camelot. He was also a talented poet, singer and musician with the lute.\n\nPercy wielded the Ebony Blade, and Merlin's spells rendered the Black Knight invulnerable to physical harm as long as he held the Ebony Blade. However, the spells were ineffective against a weapon made of the same metal as the Ebony Blade. He also wore body armor and a helmet which were similarly rendered impenetrable by Merlin's spells.\n\nSir Percy appeared in the \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" episode \"Knights & Demons\" (which was scripted by Don Glut), voiced by Vic Perrin. Dane Whitman was also to appear, but was rejected to avoid confusion.\n\nSir Percy appears in \"Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2\". He resides in the Medieval England section of Chronopolis where his castle was taken over by Enchantress and Nathan Garrett who imprison him. Nathan Garrett impersonated Sir Percy until Captain Avalon exposed his identity. After Captain America, Captain Avalon, Doctor Strange, and Star-Lord defeat Enchantress and Nathan Garrett, Sir Percy is freed by Doctor Strange who thanks the heroes for helping to reclaim his kingdom.\n\n"}

Hunt traveled to the Near East, lived in Egypt, and wrote numerous books on theology, prophecy, cults, and other religions, including critiques of Catholicism, Islam, Mormonism, and Calvinism, among others. \nHunt's Christian theology was evangelical dispensational and he was associated with the Plymouth Brethren movement.\n\nDavid Charles Haddon Hunt was born on September 30, 1926, in Riverside, California, to Lillie and Albert Hunt. He was raised in a Christian family, with two other siblings. As a young man, he also spent time in the military, at the end of World War II. He was an alumnus of UCLA. From June 24, 1950, until his death, Hunt was married to his college sweetheart, Ruth Klaussen (1926–2013), who together raised four children: David Jr., Janna, Karen and Jon. He worked as a CPA before his entry into full-time ministry.\n\nHunt believed occult or pagan influences are pervasive in modern culture - this includes evolution, as well as all forms of psychology, some forms of entertainment, yoga, and some forms of medicine. His book \"Occult Invasion\" is dedicated to this area, while several other books mention it in part.\n\nHunt was a strict Biblical Creationist - refutations of evolution and theistic evolution were a frequent topic of his radio programs, \"Search the Scriptures Daily\" and \"According to God's Word\".\n\nHunt addressed Calvinism in a book called \"What Love is This? Calvinism's Misrepresentation of God\", published in 2002 and revised in 2004 and 2006. He sought to refute many alleged misconceptions of Calvinism without taking an Arminian stance. He outlined a theological middle ground between Calvinism and Arminianism, where, according to Hunt, one can believe in eternal security but reject Calvinistic teaching. \nAlso published in 2004 was \"Debating Calvinism: Five Points, Two Views\", co-written in a point-counterpoint debate format by Hunt and Calvinist apologist James White.\n\nIn \"A Woman Rides the Beast\", he identified the Roman Catholic Church as the Whore of Babylon from the prophecies in chapters 17 and 18 of the Book of Revelation.\n\nThe book \"The Godmakers\" (1984), which Dave Hunt co-wrote with Ed Decker, and the accompanying film \"The God Makers\" (1982) by Jeremiah Films were an exposé of Mormonism, highlighting the Mormon belief that Jesus is the spirit brother of Lucifer and many other disturbing facts. The book and film have been criticized not only by Mormons themselves as inaccurate portrayals of their religion but also as inaccurate by other non-Mormon groups that are critical of Mormonism.\n\nIn 1973 he wrote the screenplay for \"Time to Run,\" a Christian film produced for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (Hunt later criticized Graham's ministry for its open ecumenism).\n\n\"The Seduction of Christianity\" (co-written with Tom A. McMahon), which categorized Word of Faith teachings, meditation, and psychology-based counseling as New Age heresies, generated much debate in the 1980s. Responses from meditation proponents and from Calvinist re-constructionist writers include \"Seduction?? A Biblical Response\" and \"The Reduction of Christianity\". Hunt has written a rejoinder to the latter critics in his \"Whatever Happened to Heaven?\"\n\nHunt wrote about Y2K with the intent of refuting the fearful predictions being made by other Christian fundamentalist writers (Y2K: A Reasoned Response To Mass Hysteria).\n\nIn his final book, \"Cosmos, Creator and Human Destiny\", Hunt supported the Creationist viewpoint and alleged that there were deficiencies in both the Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution.\n\n\n\n"}

A relatively small tribe, they nevertheless managed to intersperse themselves in a number of territorial conflicts which broke out throughout the Trucial States in the 20th Century.\n\nAlthough the Duru were on good terms with the Al Bu Shamis and considered themselves dependents of Dubai, they were in conflict with the warlike Awamir, who encroached on their \"dar\" or territory. In the 1920s, in Liwa and Buraimi, fighting broke out between the Bedouin tribes, with the Manasir and Bani Yas fighting a southern confederation of Awamir, Duru and Al Bu Shamis. An ally of the Wahhabis, Hamdan managed to broker an uneasy truce. However, fighting broke out again in the Buraimi oasis, between the Duru, Manasir and Bani Qitab. The escalating conflict provided an early challenge for the new Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who marched against the Duru in December 1923. Word got out of his movement and the Duru and Awamir raised a force, together with the Bani Qitab of Falayah, which met a party of 20 riders from Abu Dhabi and killed seven of them and captured the rest. Raising a force of 200 men, the Northern confederation raided Buraimi while Sultan's forces raided Falayah. The Duru, understanding that men from Dubai had been supporting Sultan, raided Dubai in revenge.\n\nA concerted effort at conciliation followed, as the various Trucial Rulers recognised that the ongoing conflicts were threatening to descend into a state of general war. The Duru, as well as the Al Bu Shamis, sought the protection of the Wahhabi agent, Ibn Jaluwi, who was only too pleased to extend his influence among the tribes of the Trucial States and Oman.\n\nThis led to an ongoing and bloody conflict and in the 1940s, fighting led the headman of the Bedouin Awamir, Salim bin Hamad bin Rakkad, to lead his people to Al Hasa in 1943. They returned in 1948, but in subsequent years were constantly drawn back to Hasa. The bulk of the tribe remained at Buraimi and petitioned the Al Bu Falah for protection. One of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan's first acts when he was appointed \"wali\" of Al Ain was to call for Salim bin Mussalam bin Hamm and appoint him as head of the Bedouin Awamir. The portion of the tribe which had moved south under Salim bin Hamad became Saudi citizens and this schism within the Awamir, driven by the Duru, was later to form part of the territorial arguments put forward in the Buraimi Dispute.\n"}

{"id": "57641664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57641664", "title": "Florentino López Cuevillas", "text": "Florentino López Cuevillas\n\nFlorentino López Alonso-Cuevillas (November 14, 1886 - July 30, 1958) was a Spanish anthropologist and prehistorian, although in the course of his life he also became involved in writing, primarily essays and fiction. Like several other Galician intellectuals of his generation, he was a member of \"Xeración Nós\", of the Seminar of Galician Studies and the Irmandades da Fala, combining the cultural and linguistic activities he carried out in those institutions with a discrete participation in pro-Galican politics. However, his social and political activities were profoundly disrupted by the victory of nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, although in the 1940s he returned to his commitment to the spread of Galician culture as a full member of the Royal Galician Academy, and of the Instituto de Estudios Gallegos Padre Sarmiento.\n\nLike the other members of his generation, he contributed to the maturation of Galician literature, but he was renown as a result of his efforts in the field of science. Galvanized by Hugo Obermaier's book (\"Impresiones de un viaje prehistórico por Galicia\"), Cuevillas undertook the complicated task of developing the field of archeology in Galicia with the aim of reconstructing and studying a period of history that had been hitherto forgotten. His field research, mostly directed at the study of megalithic art and the celtic Castro culture, as well as his systematization of Galician prehistory, lead him to be crowned as the most important figure in Galicia in the field of prehistory. Indirectly, his scientific work contributed to the normalization of the Galician language.\n\nFlorentino López Alonso-Cuevillas was born on November 14, 1886 at 77 Progress Street, Ourense. He was the only son of don Florentino López Barbán, an agent of the tax office who practiced his profession in Ourense as well as Lugo, and doña Vicenta Alonso-Cuevillas Álvarez, daughter of a famous brigadier who carried out many important military duties in Ourense and who belonged to the prestigious Seara family.\n\nCuevillas's father's death in Lugo before his birth quickly caused his mother to move in with her family in Ourense. From that moment on, Florentino Cuevillas was raised and educated by his maternal family, receiving an education few people would have been able to afford at that time. As a preschooler he attended a girl's school, which accepted very young children, and later attended the Colegio León XIII. It was at this time that he began to develop an interest in music, and he went on to learn the violin in his youth. Between 1896 and 1901 he studied at the Instituto de Orense where he was taught by teachers of great renown, such as the professor of rhetoric and poetry, Marcelo Macías. After five years of study he completed his baccalaureate studies (at the time still regulated by the Ley Moyano), and subsequently attended the University of Santiago de Compostela to study pharmacology, although he never went on to practice that profession. During the course of his college years, he displayed a great interest in literature and during this time he attended literary outings of the Ateneo León XIII as well as conferences organized by the alumni of the medical and legal departments. He was licensed in June 1906, and five years later he moved to Madrid to take classes in the social sciences. In the capital he came into contact with Otero Pedrayo, Primitivo Rodríguez Sanjurjo and Urbano Feijoo de Sotomayor, attended meetings in the Ateneo, theatrical and opera performances, and frequented social gatherings of the most famous Madrilenians of the era. In Madrid he worked as a functionary of the government, returning for brief spells to Galicia. Feeling lost in Madrid, he returned to Ourense. Upon his return to the city of his birth, he abandoned the field of pharmacology to work as a tax official. Afterwards he wed Milagros Rodríguez, which whom he had three daughters.\n\nCuevillas's first writings were political articles and articles of literary criticism that were published in the newspaper \"El Miño\", a newspaper which Risco also frequently contributed to. Cuevillas also contributed to other publications like \"La Zarpa\", \"El Pueblo Gallego\", \"Diario de Orense\", \"El Heraldo\", \"\", \"Faro de Vigo\", \"La Noche\" and \"La Región\". In 1917, members of a theosophical church called \"Roso de Luna\" (Rodríguez Sanjurjo, Vicente Risco y Cuevillas) decided to found the magazine \"La Centuria\". Cuevillas was a contributor to this new literary project, with a sociopolitical slant manifesting itself more and more in his lectures and works. In the same year, and due to the influence of Antón Losada Diéguez, Cuevillas got involved in Galicianism. In addition he joined las Irmandades da Fala, and was involved in the founding of the magazine Nós as well as the Republican Nationalist Party of Ourense and he was appointed minister of the Irmandade Nazonalista Galega. In 1922 he published his first work of archeology in Nós, the article \"Dos nosos tempos\" which forms along with the works of Otero Pedrayo and Vicente Risco a generational manifesto of the Ourensian group.\n\nAfter the end of the Spanish Civil War, like many other Galician nationalists, he was forced to abandon his political activities. In 1939 he continued his archeological studies, but later as a result of worsening of rheumatism in his joints he had to abandon fieldwork and dedicated himself to the systematization of Galician prehistory. On July 7, 1941, Cuevillas was admitted as a full member of the Royal Galician Academy at the proposition of Ramón Otero Pedrayo, Ángel del Castillo López y Alejandro Barreiro Noya. Three years later, in 1944, he was admitted to the Instituto de Estudios Padre Sarmiento. That same year he wrote \"Prehistoria\" which would become the third volume of \"Historia de Galiza\", edited by Otero Pedrayo.\n\nOn July 30, 1958 he died in his house on Santo Domingo in Ourense, as a result of a worsening of the rheumatism from which he suffered. He was interred at the Cementerio de San Francisco de Orense. At the moment of his interment, \"Requiem a Cuevillas\", written for him by Fermín Bouza Brey, was sung. The sixth celebration of Galician Literature Day, in 1968, was dedicated to his memory.\n\nCuevillas's archeological work, which grew with the assistance of the people associated with the Museo da Comisión de Monumentos, is reflected in the study \"A mansión de Aquis Querquernis\" (1921) contained a vast amount of work on pre-Roman Galicia. In fact, it was him and his group of collaborators that began a brief excavation in the early 1920s on the site of the Roman encampment of Aquis Querquennis, discovering the wall of the encampment, although they didn't this short wall as the principle wall of the complex, and other walls of small size related to habitable structures.\n\nCuevillas was a great scholar of the Castro culture, with his initial work on that topic appearing in the magazine Nós. The first Castro site he studied was located in the parish of San Cibrao de Las (Orense), consisting of a fortress nine hectares in area, and one of the largest sites in Galicia. The excavations, overseen at all times by Cuevillas, began in 1922 and continuing until 1925, when they came to a halt. Although the investigation lasted only three years, (in the 1940s he would resume the excavation), it served as a source of data for his works, published in Nós (which also published his Catálogo dos Castros Galegos) under the title \"A Edade de Ferro no Galiza\".\n\nAfter being founded in 1923, López Cuevillas joined the Seminario de Estudos Galegos and began to collaborate closely with Fermín Bouza Brey. Out of this professional relationship came the study and excavation of the Castro de O Neixón in 1925, the site where Cuevillas discovered the remains of a Punic aryballos that was produced in Carthaginian workshops in the Mediterranean, consequently bringing to light the existence of commercial relationships between the ancient settlers of Galicia and merchants on the edges of the Mediterranean. His work on this site formed a major part of the work \"Os oestrymnios, os saefes e a ofiolatría en Galicia\" (1929). In 1927 he undertook the first archaeological journey across all of Galicia, along with Fermín Bouza Brey, through the financial support of the Comisión de Estudios de Galicia. The journey resulted in the study of archaeological sites in Sobroso and Briteiros.\n\nIn 1929 Cuevillas worked with the archeologist Lluís Pericot on the excavation of the Castro de Troña, removing numerous pieces of handicrafts and coins of both Celtic and Roman origin from the complex. Furthermore, in their initial work in the area they discovered around 30 circular structures, the moat and defensive walls on the eastern side.\n\nOn some occasions, Cuevillas limited himself to only the search and exploration of the Castro culture without doing any excavation in the areas in which they had settled. This is what happened in el Outeiro do Castro, a diminutive site in the parish of Canda.\n\nHe, along with Otero Pedrayo and Vicente Risco, argued against the theory that held that there was a possibility that the ruins of the Castro culture and the dolmens were contemporaneous structures, thinking the prior were produced by a Celtic culture, and had no relation to the stone age.\n\nIn 1934, Cuevillas carried out a historical study regarding the possible origin of Ourense, in which he considered the transportation infrastructure as a determining factor in the birth of the city. During the Roman period an imperial road of notable importance passed through the city, as well as a confluence of various secondary roads and natural passageways like the Miño, Loña and Barbaña-Barbadás rivers.\n\nThe main defining idea of Cuevillas's theory was the belief that the original population nucleus in the region developed nearby As Burgas and not along the path of the Miño river, to argue for an indigenous foundation tied to the thermal springs and not to the Romans. The existence of these hot springs made Cuevillas think of them as a possible site of pilgrimage for the nearby members of the Castro culture before the Roman conquest, which lead to the appearance of small markets and other structures of a commercial nature. Therefore, upon Roman arrival they would have discovered a limited existing community, to which they would have added a certain degree of development.\n\n\"Prosas Galegas, 1920 – 1958\", a posthumous collection of 32 essays, was published in 1962, and is not strictly about science, but also literature. Although some of these essays had already come to light earlier, for example \"Como nasceu a cidade de Ourense\", and \"O Trasno na vila\", these essays reveal an unpublished Cuevillas, a creator who coexisted with the investigator.\n\nBeginning even in the prologue of the collection, written by Marino Dónega, critics increasingly came to appreciate his magnificent and serene prose, even though in his time it hadn't gained much attention.\n\nThe book is divided into four untitled sections. The first two sections contain the prose that most praises the nature and values of Galicia, introducing the countryside, the cities and traditions, while others serve as critical commentary on current society (such as \"Dos nosos tempos\", in which the intellectual evolution of society is reflected in the same way as it occurred to the other members of his generation).\n\nThe third group, characterized by its short length, contains three biographical sketches of Galician writers (specifically Curros Enríquez, Valentín Lamas Carvajal and Otero Pedrayo)and a commentary on the work of Castelao \"As cruces de pedra na Galiza\". All of the essays were written in the period after the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFinally, the fourth group of essays deals more with his work in the study and exploration of Galician pre-history, featuring works with significant names such as \"Relaciós prehistóricas entre Galicia e as Illas Británicas\". In this last block, the prose usually has an informative value typical of essays (some of the pieces can be considered studies, like \"Paleopaisaxe\" and \"Mitoloxía e historia da paisaxe de Trasalba\").\n\nIn the words of Ricardo Carballo Calero, \"Prosas galegas\" is characterized by its conviction and rhetorical harmony, evident sincerity and idealism.\n\nVarious investigative works Cuevilla produced over the course of his life that were published in \"Nós\", \"Boletín de la Real Academia Gallega\", the \"Arquivos do Seminario de Estudos Galegos\", the \"Boletín da Comisión Provincial de Monumentos de Ourense\", the \"Cuadernos de Estudios Gallegos\" as well as other publications, were partially compiled in the volume \"Miscelánea\" (1987).\n\n\n\n"}

He is the uncle of a member of the Hong Kong national football team, Ng Wai Chiu\n\nNg revealed in a stand-up comedy, saying that when he was a child he told his mother that his dream was to get a job that does not need any academic qualification, without a fixed working hours and high pay. Then, his mother asked him to become a beggar. So, he went to Wong Tai Sin, a famous temple in Hong Kong, to observe those beggars there. He realised that becoming beggar is too busy and need to perform manual labour, which does not suit his free and unconstrained attitude. Consequently, he gave up and decided to become a movie star because being a movie star fulfilled all the condition he requested.\n\nDuring that time, the only way to become a movie star was to get into TVB Training Classes, so Ng signed up. After failing thrice entering the training classes, he eventually gave up. He went for a short period Pabbajja for seven days, shaved his head bald. After the event, he decided to try applying for the training classes again and this time he succeeded. He said in an interview that he succeeded because the interviewer thought that he Knew Shaolin Kung Fu due to his bald head.\n\nHe graduated from TVB's training classes in 1982 along with Stephen Chow and Tony Leung. He acted in minor roles for the first few years in his television career. Until 1985, he started to involve in a great deal of TV Series, he was very outstanding in playing villainous roles in TV series such as \"The Price of Growing Up\" and \"The Final Combat\". Later on, he played as a protagonist in situation comedies such as \"Everybody Loves Somebody\" and \"The Family Squad\", which make him gradually disengage from being the stereotypical villain.\n\nHis contract with TVB ended in 1993 and he broke into the movie industry. In 1997, he returned to TVB to star a nostalgic comedy series \"Old Time Buddy\" with Gallen Lo, Maggie Cheung and Jessica Hsuen, which was one of the highest rating TV series that year.

He was the eldest son of Frederick Mahomed (1818–1888) and his second wife, Sarah Hodgkinson (1816–1905). He was also the grandson of the Bengali traveller Sake Dean Mahomed. Frederick Akbar Mahomed's father, Frederick Mahomed, ran a fencing, gymnastics and callisthenics academy in Hove, which included boxing instruction. Cameron and Hicks dispute the suggestion that he ran Turkish baths at Brighton attributing this to a confusion of Mahomed's father Frederick with his uncle, Arthur. Mahomed had three brothers (Arthur George Suleiman, James Deen Kerriman and Henry), and one sister (Adeline). He was educated privately in Brighton prior to attending medical school.\n\nOn June 14, 1873 at the parish church of St Nicholas', Brighton, Mahomed married Ellen (Nellie) Chalk. The couple had two children, a son, Archibald in 1874 and a daughter, Ellen in 1876. Only a month after the birth of Ellen in 1876, his wife, Ellen, died suddenly of septicemia and Mahomed and his family moved in with his uncle, Horatio, also a widower, in Seymour Street near Portman Square, London. In 1879 Mahomed married Ada Chalk, the younger sister of his first wife. As such a marriage was not legal under English law, the couple married in Switzerland. They lived at 12 St Thomas' Street, close to Guy's Hospital. The couple had two daughters, Dorothy in 1880, and Janet in 1881, and a son, Humphry in 1883. In 1884 the family moved from St Thomas' Street into a six-story Georgian house at 24 Manchester Square. Sadly, later that year, Mahomed contracted typhoid fever, presumably from a patient at the London Fever Hospital, where he was working. He died on 22 November 1884 from an intestinal hemorrhage and a perforated intestine. He was buried at Highgate Cemetery. On his death a subscription was set up to assist his family and several notable physicians including Sir William Gull, Sir Samuel Wilks, Sir James Paget and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson contributed. His oldest son, Archibald, later became a doctor, and in 1914 Archibald and the rest of the family changed their name to Deane (possibly acknowledging Frederick's grandfather's name, Deen) to lessen the impact of the xenophobia and racial prejudice associated with the outbreak of the World War I. Frederick's second wife, Ada Deane, died in New York in 1940. Of Frederick's children, Archibald Deane died in 1948, Ellen died in 1954, Janet in died 1955, Humphry died in 1955 and Dorothy died in 1962.\n\nIn 1867, aged 18, Mahomed began to study medicine at the Sussex County Hospital, Brighton. Two years later in October 1869, he entered Guy's Hospital, London as a medical student. He was an outstanding student and, in 1871, won the student Pupils' Physical Society prize for his work on the sphygmograph, having been runner-up the previous year. Mahomed qualified as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1872. Following qualification, Mahomed worked at Highgate Infirmary (St Pancras' North Infirmary, Central London Sick Asylum) for a year. In 1873, he was appointed as resident medical officer at the London Fever Hospital in Liverpool Street, Islington. In 1874 Mahomed became a member of the Royal College of Physicians and was appointed as Student Tutor and Pathologist at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. In 1875, Mahomed gained a doctorate (M.D.) from the University of Brussels. In 1877, he returned to Guy's Hospital as a Registrar (Senior Resident). He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1880, and in 1881, he was awarded an M.B. from Cambridge University for his thesis on \"Chronic Bright's disease without albuminuria\". In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician at Guy's Hospital and, in 1882, he was appointed as a Demonstrator in Morbid Anatomy at Guy's Hospital.Mahomed‘s earliest contribution, while still a medical student, was to improve the sphygmograph, a device for measuring blood pressure that had originally been devised by Karl von Vierordt and further developed by Étienne-Jules Marey. Mahomed’s major innovation was to make the sphygmograph quantitative, so that it was able to measure arterial blood pressure (in Troy ounces). The description of the modified instrument was published in 1872. Following his graduation in the same year, Mahomed took up an appointment at the Central London Sick Asylum, where he worked with Sir William Broadbent, who became a strong supporter and friend. Several of Mahomed’s pulse tracings are contained in Broadbent’s classic book, The Pulse. Mahomed used the new sphygmograph to measure arterial tension (blood pressure) in Bright's disease and a range of other conditions, including pregnancy, scarlet fever, gout, alcohol and lead poisoning. He found that in some individuals blood pressure was elevated before there was evidence of kidney disease, assessed by measurement of protein in the urine (proteinuria). He also made the association between the elevated blood pressure and various post-mortem changes, including enlargement of the heart (cardiac hypertrophy), thickening and fibrosis of the arterial wall, aneurysm formation, and damage to the microcirculation (arterio-capillary fibrosis). In effect, Mahomed was describing most of the key pathological effects of essential hypertension for the first time. Initially he termed this condition \"Bright's disease without albuminuria\" but later he described it as “high pressure diathesis”. His description of the condition is worth citing:‘…the existence of this abnormally high pressure does not necessarily mean disease, but only a tendency towards disease. It is a functional condition, not necessarily a permanent one, though it is generally more or less so in these individuals. These persons appear to pass on through life pretty much as others do… As age advances the enemy gains accessions of strength; perhaps the mode of life assists him - good living and alcoholic beverages make secure his position, or head work, mental anxiety, hurried meals, constant excitement, inappropriate or badly cooked food, or any other of the common but undesirable circumstances of everyday life, tend to intensify the existing condition, or, if not previously present, perhaps produce it. Now under this greatly increased arterial pressure, hearts begin to hypertrophy and arteries to thicken; what has previously been a functional condition tends to become more of the nature of an organic one…’Mahomed also proposed that reducing blood pressure would prolong life, although the means of doing that in his era were in the main limited to lifestyle advice.\n\nIn 1880 Mahomed made a first foray into public health. He wrote to the British Medical Journal to advocate undertaking the comprehensive systematic documentation of disease in Britain; he termed this idea, Collective Investigation. Mahomed’s proposals were warmly supported by Sir George Murray Humphry, the President of the British Medical Association, and a Collective Investigation Committee was formed in 1881 with Mahomed as secretary. Around this time Mahomed became acquainted with the British polymath, Francis Galton, who shared an interest in factors predisposing to disease. Mahomed and Galton collaborated to produce composite photographs of over 400 patients with phthisis (Tuberculosis), which they compared with composite photographs based on 200 individuals without evidence of phthisis to test whether, as was widely believed, appearance or looks indicated a predisposition to disease. They found no evidence of a characteristic facial appearance associated with tuberculosis beyond some evidence of emaciation.\n\nIn 1882 Mahomed advocated expanding Collective Investigation to include a general collection of detailed family life histories: 'for encouraging patients to keep carefully prepared records of their lives and of the chief incidents therein, both medical and otherwise. These records would prove of very great value, alike to the patient, to the doctor, and to medical science.'A life-history subcommittee of the Collective Investigation Committee, including both Mahomed and Galton was formed in 1882.\n\nInitially the Collective Investigation Committee was very successful with 54 local Collective Investigation Committees being formed to collect data. Their preliminary findings were published in 1883 as a 76-page single volume called 'The Collective Investigation Record' and included results based on more than 2000 patients. In 1884, a Life History Album was published to allow parents to record details of family circumstances and child development. It was advertized in Nature and Galton offered prizes of £500 to people who submitted the most complete family records - within 5 months he had received in excess of 150 records. Over the subsequent 5 years data based on over 300 family records were published, with the main findings summarised in Galton’s book, Natural Inheritance. However, Mahomed would not see these achievements as he died in November 1884 from typhoid fever.\n\nMichael F. O'Rourke summarizes the contributions of Frederick Akbar Mahomed as follows:\n"}

Yeh is an American social entrepreneur and conservation biologist who founded Sea Turtles 911, a non-profit sea turtle rescue and conservation organization that operates in the United States and China.\n\nYeh attended Montgomery County Public Schools, including Thomas S. Wootton High School, and graduated from Johns Hopkins University and Duke University. In 2007, Yeh discovered that endangered sea turtles on Hainan island, China, were being sold illegally for their meat and shell. During an interview with CNN, Yeh described, \"I felt really hopeless at that time ... You would see land turtles and freshwater turtles (in the market) and some of those are legal, but when you see a sea turtle it's clearly not supposed to be there and that's shocking to see.\" This finding was emotionally disturbing to Yeh and became a turning point in his life, which led to the founding of the first non-profit organization working for the advancement of sea turtle protection and conservation in China.\n\nDespite the desperate state of sea turtles in China, Yeh was inspired in 2008 when he saw wild sea turtles undisturbed by people as the animals were naturally basking on public beaches in Hawaii. As Yeh said on a CNN interview, \"When you see the sea turtles in Hawaii, how great they are, it's worth it when you can envision that and hope that one day it will happen in Hainan, one day, in China.\" This experience led Yeh to believe that sea turtles and people could live in harmony and that there was still hope in China because of the successful sea turtle conservation efforts in Hawaii. According to the global authority on nature conservation, International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the sea turtles of the Hawaiian Islands were also once under the threat of near extinction, but are now thriving and their conservation status reclassified as \"Least Concern\" according to the IUCN Red List. Thus, Yeh established Sea Turtles 911 under Hawaiian jurisdiction, and changed the course of his life by moving to China to save the sea turtles he had hopelessly witnessed being sold, earning him the nickname \"The unlikely sea turtle savior\" by the BBC. Building a floating sea turtle hospital in a Chinese fishing village known for its extensive sea turtle poaching, Yeh makes a point to work with people of all types to support sea turtle conservation in the area, including government officials, academia, fishermen and poachers, community members, local and international volunteers. At a sea turtle release event held at the Ritz-Carlton, Sanya, Yeh stated, \"For our release events, if we can bring multiple sectors in our community together, it will be very beneficial to sea turtle conservation in China. It is my hope that we can put other issues aside and agree on sea turtle rights, for the advancement of sea turtle conservation.\" Local community members, including fishermen and coast guard police, describe Yeh as a true \"Haigui\" or a \"returning sea turtle,\" and defer to his expertise when endangered sea turtles are rescued and in need of medical attention.\n\nYeh promotes environmental conservation through publicized sea turtle release events in China, and is vocal about ending sea turtle exploitation in Chinese media. As he has said, \"Their survival is our responsibility; we must create hope.\" During interviews with journalists, he is known to use metaphors to facilitate the understanding of environmental conservation to the public. Yeh cautioned the Chinese public not to delay the increased protection efforts of sea turtles until they decline to the same population level as China's cherished Giant panda. In addressing marine pollution problems in China, he reminds the public not to treat the ocean as an enormous toilet and garbage dump.\n\nIn China, poached sea turtles include endangered Green sea turtles raised primarily for consumption of their meat, and the critically endangered Hawksbill sea turtle raised for the trade in shell products such as jewelry, combs, eyeglass frames, and preserved trophies. During a speech condemning the use of sea turtle products, Yeh echoed Yao Ming's famous quotation, \"When the buying stops, the killing can too.\"\n\nDeclaring July 4, 2012, as a day of freedom for all marine animals, Yeh led the release of an endangered Whale shark that had been caught accidentally by a Chinese fishing boat as bycatch, as well as two Green sea turtles. At this event, he proclaimed, \"Sea turtle conservation does not only involve sea turtles. When we protect charismatic species such as whale sharks, those efforts spill over and protect sea turtles as well. These two animals share the ocean, and we must learn to share the ocean with them.” Holding humans accountable for sea turtle and Whale shark endangerment, he added that, \"protecting them is humankind's responsibility.\"\n\nOn March 23, 2013, Yeh spoke out on climate change and global warming during Earth Hour, the one hour when the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) encourages businesses and households worldwide to switch off their lights to raise awareness on climate change. Sea turtle eggs are influenced by a biological process known as Temperature-dependent sex determination, meaning that their gender is determined by the environmental temperature. Yeh reminded the public, “As the global climate’s average temperature increases, more females will be hatched, jeopardizing sea turtle populations with an unbalanced sex ratio.”\n\nIn an interview with China's official state-run news agency, Xinhua News Agency, Yeh called for a celebrity to help save endangered sea turtles by raising public awareness. In 2014, Yeh was answered by former NBA basketball superstar Yao Ming, who consistently ranked #1 on the Forbes China Celebrity 100. Yao Ming joined Yeh in his public sea turtle release events and the duo set free rescued turtles back into the wild, raising awareness together that leads people to \"an epiphany that turtles belong in the wild, and not in the market.”\n\nOn June 8, 2015, Yeh led a large-scale event in which five (5) rescued sea turtles were released from different beaches around the island of Hainan to maximize conservation awareness for World Oceans Day as recognized by the United Nations. Yeh said, \"The emotional experience of watching a sea turtle swim for freedom back to nature reminds us that we are all connected to the vast ocean expanse, and thus have the responsibility to protect them for our future generations.”\n\nOn January 15, 2016, United States Ambassador to China and former U.S. Senator Max Baucus joined Yeh in the release of two rescued turtles named Harvard and Yale into the South China Sea. According to Yeh, the U.S. Ambassador’s charitable act was recognized as symbolic because \"Sea turtles are charismatic, migratory animals that serve as natural ambassadors of the ocean; as communities and countries work together to preserve this flagship species for future generations, our shared mission to save sea turtles nurtures a peaceful platform of common grounds to improve community and international relations.\"\n\nOn March 30, 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China honored Yeh the 2012 Popular Science Award, in recognition for his significant contributions to public awareness of marine conservation.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, the International Union for Conservation of Nature officially recognized Yeh as a marine turtle expert in the China region.\n\nOn June 22, 2015, Duke University awarded Yeh with the prestigious Global Fellowship in Marine Conservation.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, the United States Department of State and the National Development and Reform Commission supported Yeh to lead the U.S.-China bilateral partnership to save endangered sea turtles.\n\nOn July 28, 2015, National Geographic interviewed Yeh as their Featured Explorer to inspire children to save sea turtles.\n\nOn April 15, 2018, the Committee of 100 officially recognized Yeh as their Next Generation Leader to advance the betterment of U.S.-China relations. Committee delegations have been invited to give briefings to top officials at the White House and Zhongnanhai. Prominent members of the committee include Ambassador Gary Locke, former United States Secretary of Commerce and Governor of Washington; I. M. Pei, renowned architect; Yo-Yo Ma, master cellist; Jerry Yang, Founder of Yahoo!; David Ho, \"Time\" magazine's 1996 Man of the Year for pioneering HIV/AIDS research; Michelle Kwan, Olympic medalist in figure skating; and Steve Chen, Founder of YouTube.\n\n"}
{"id": "12731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12731", "title": "George Harrison", "text": "George Harrison\n\nGeorge Harrison (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"Taxman\", \"Within You Without You\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album \"All Things Must Pass\", a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor for later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.\n\nHarrison was born at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, on 25 February 1943. He was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909–1978) and Louise (née French; 1911–1970). Harold was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the White Star Line, and Louise was a shop assistant of Irish Catholic descent. He had one sister, Louise (born 16 August 1931), and two brothers, Harold (born 1934) and Peter (20 July 1940 – 1 June 2007).\n\nAccording to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: \"All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music.\" Louise was an enthusiastic music fan, and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows. When Louise was pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast \"Radio India\". Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, \"Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb.\"\n\nHarrison lived the first four years of his life at 12 Arnold Grove, a terraced house on a cul-de-sac. The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the family was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke. In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959. Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt the school \"moulded [students] into being frightened\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael; by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences. In early 1956 he had an epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll. He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, \"I was totally into guitars.\" Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another early influence: \"The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in.\"\n\nAlthough Harold Harrison was apprehensive about his son's interest in pursuing a music career, in 1956 he bought George a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar, which according to Harold, cost £3.10 (equivalent to £ in 2018). One of his father's friends taught Harrison how to play \"Whispering\", \"Sweet Sue\" and \"Dinah\", and, inspired by Donegan's music, Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly. On the bus to school, Harrison met Paul McCartney, who also attended the Liverpool Institute, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.\n\nHarrison became part of the Beatles with McCartney and John Lennon when the band were still a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. In March 1958, he auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm's Morgue Skiffle Club, playing Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith's \"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\", but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band. McCartney arranged a second meeting, on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, during which Harrison impressed Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental \"Raunchy\". He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed, and then became accepted as a member. Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers, a local department store. During the group's first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym \"Carl Harrison\", in reference to Carl Perkins.\n\nIn 1960, promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the Indra and Kaiserkeller clubs in Hamburg, both owned by Bruno Koschmider. Their first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished up their image and later secured them a recording contract with EMI. The group's first single, \"Love Me Do\", peaked at number seventeen on the \"Record Retailer\" chart, and by the time their debut album, \"Please Please Me\", was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived. Often serious and focused while on stage with the band, Harrison was known as \"the quiet Beatle\". He had two lead vocal credits on the LP, including the Lennon–McCartney song \"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\", and three on their second album, \"With the Beatles\" (1963). The latter included \"Don't Bother Me\", Harrison's first solo writing credit.\n\nHarrison served as the Beatles' scout for new American releases, being especially knowledgeable about soul music. By 1965's \"Rubber Soul\", he had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". He later called \"Rubber Soul\" his \"favourite [Beatles] album\". \"Revolver\" (1966) included three of his compositions: \"Taxman\", selected as the album's opening track, \"Love You To\" and \"I Want to Tell You\". His drone-like tambura part on Lennon's \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments, while the sitar- and tabla-based \"Love You To\" represented the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music. According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck, the latter song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody. Author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1978 that following Harrison's increased association with the sitar after \"Norwegian Wood\", he became known as \"the maharaja of raga-rock\". Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nBy late 1966, Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles. This was reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" in 1967. His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired \"Within You Without You\", to which no other Beatle contributed. He played sitar and tambura on the track, backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba, swarmandal and tabla. He later commented on the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album: \"It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry ... There's about half the songs I like and the other half I can't stand.\"\nIn January 1968, he recorded the basic track for his song \"The Inner Light\" at EMI's studio in Bombay, using a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments. Released as the B-side to McCartney's \"Lady Madonna\", it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single. Derived from a quotation from the \"Tao Te Ching\", the song's lyric reflected Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation. During the recording of \"The Beatles\" that same year, tensions within the group ran high, and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly. Harrison's four songwriting contributions to the double album included \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar, and the horn-driven \"Savoy Truffle\".\n\nDylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles. While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles. Tensions among the group surfaced again in January 1969, at Twickenham Studios, during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary \"Let It Be\". Frustrated by the cold and sterile film studio, by Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles, and by what he perceived as a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January. He returned twelve days later, after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to their own Apple Studio and to abandon McCartney's plan for making a return to public performance.\n\nRelations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, when the band recorded their 1969 album \"Abbey Road\". The LP included what Lavezzoli describes as \"two classic contributions\" from Harrison – \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\" – that saw him \"finally achieve equal songwriting status\" with Lennon and McCartney. During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, rejecting suggestions for changes to his music, particularly from McCartney. \"Something\" became his first A-side when issued on a double A-side single with \"Come Together\"; the song was number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany, and the combined sides topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in the United States. In the 1970s Frank Sinatra recorded \"Something\" twice (1970 and 1979) and later dubbed it \"the greatest love song of the past fifty years\". Lennon considered it the best song on \"Abbey Road\", and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after \"Yesterday\".\n\nIn May 1970 Harrison's \"For You Blue\" was coupled on a US single with McCartney's \"The Long and Winding Road\" and became Harrison's second chart-topper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Hot 100. His increased productivity meant that by the time of their break-up he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions. While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's break-up. Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded his song \"I Me Mine\" for the \"Let It Be\" soundtrack album.\n\nBefore the Beatles' break-up, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: \"Wonderwall Music\" and \"Electronic Sound\", both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions. \"Wonderwall Music\", a soundtrack to the 1968 film \"Wonderwall\", blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while \"Electronic Sound\" is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer. Released in November 1968, \"Wonderwall Music\" was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records. Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage \"Dream Scene\", recorded several months before Lennon's \"Revolution 9\".\n\nIn December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. During the tour that included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Harrison began to write \"My Sweet Lord\", which became his first single as a solo artist. Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar, significantly influencing his later music.\n\nFor many years, Harrison was restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles' albums, but he released \"All Things Must Pass\", a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends. The album was regarded by many as his best work, and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. The LP produced the number-one hit single \"My Sweet Lord\" and the top-ten single \"What Is Life\". The album was co-produced by Phil Spector using his \"Wall of Sound\" approach, and the musicians included Starr, Clapton, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie's Friends band and the Apple group Badfinger. On release, \"All Things Must Pass\" was received with critical acclaim; Ben Gerson of \"Rolling Stone\" described it as being \"of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of the album's title track \"a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion\" to Harrison's former band. In 1971, Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over \"My Sweet Lord\", owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit \"He's So Fine\". When the case was heard in the United States district court in 1976, he denied deliberately plagiarising the song, but lost the case, as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously.\n\nIn 2000, Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album, and Harrison actively participated in its promotion. In an interview, he reflected on the work: \"It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion.\" He commented on the production: \"Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it ... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now.\"\n\nHarrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. The event drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's Madison Square Garden. The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, Leon Russell, Badfinger, Preston and Starr.\n\nA triple album, \"The Concert for Bangladesh\", was released by Apple in December, followed by a concert film in 1972. Credited to \"George Harrison and Friends\", the album topped the UK chart and peaked at number 2 in the US, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: \"Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended.\"\n\nHarrison's 1973 album \"Living in the Material World\" held the number one spot on the \"Billboard\" albums chart for five weeks, and the album's single, \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\", also reached number one in the US. In the UK, the LP peaked at number two and the single reached number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs. In Greene's opinion it \"contained many of the strongest compositions of his career\". Stephen Holden, writing in \"Rolling Stone\", felt the album was \"vastly appealing\" and \"profoundly seductive\", and that it stood \"alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance\". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental.\nIn November 1974, Harrison became the first ex-Beatle to tour North America when he began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour. The shows included guest spots by his band members Billy Preston and Tom Scott, and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by \"Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends\". Despite numerous positive reviews, the consensus reaction to the tour was negative. Some fans found Shankar's significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's \"sermonizing\". Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and his laryngitis-affected vocals led to some critics calling the tour \"dark hoarse\". The author Robert Rodriguez commented: \"While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated.\" Simon Leng called the tour \"groundbreaking\" and \"revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music\".\n\nIn December, Harrison released \"Dark Horse\", which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career. \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks\". The album reached number 4 on the \"Billboard\" chart and the single \"Dark Horse\" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK. The music critic Mikal Gilmore described \"Dark Horse\" as \"one of Harrison's most fascinating works – a record about change and loss\".\n\nHarrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the soul music-inspired \"Extra Texture (Read All About It)\" (1975), peaked at number 8 on the \"Billboard\" chart and number 16 in the UK. Harrison considered it the least satisfactory of the three albums he had recorded since \"All Things Must Pass\". Leng identified \"bitterness and dismay\" in many of the tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: \"He wasn't up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture ... I didn't like his frame of mind\". He released two singles from the LP: \"You\", which reached the \"Billboard\" top 20, and \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\", Apple's final original single release.\n\n\"Thirty Three & 1/3\" (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles \"This Song\" and \"Crackerbox Palace\", both of which reached the top 25 in the US. The surreal humour of \"Crackerbox Palace\" reflected Harrison's association with Monty Python's Eric Idle, who directed a comical music video for the song. With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, \"Thirty Three & 1/3\" earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since \"All Things Must Pass\". The album peaked just outside the top ten there, but outsold his previous two LPs. As part of his promotion for the release, Harrison performed on \"Saturday Night Live\" with Paul Simon.\n\nIn 1979, Harrison released \"George Harrison\", which followed his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani. Co-produced by Russ Titelman, the album and the single \"Blow Away\" both made the \"Billboard\" top 20. The album marked the beginning of Harrison's gradual retreat from the music business, with several of the songs having been written in the tranquil setting of Maui in the Hawaiian archipelago. Leng described \"George Harrison\" as \"melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss\".\n\nThe murder of John Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concern about stalkers. The tragedy was also a deep personal loss, although Harrison and Lennon had little contact in the years before Lennon was killed. Following the murder, Harrison commented: \"After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon. I am shocked and stunned.\" Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr in order to make the song a tribute to Lennon. \"All Those Years Ago\", which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney, as well as Starr's original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts. The single was included on the album \"Somewhere in England\" in 1981.\n\nHarrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982's \"Gone Troppo\" received little notice from critics or the public. During this period he made several guest appearances, including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled \"\". In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organised to raise money for the Birmingham Children's Hospital. The following year, he appeared at The Prince's Trust concert at London's Wembley Arena, performing \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\". In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: \"Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more ... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me.\"\n\nIn November 1987 Harrison released the platinum album \"Cloud Nine\". Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), the album included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's \"Got My Mind Set on You\", which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, \"When We Was Fab\", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner and Jim Horn. \"Cloud Nine\" reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on \"Billboard\"s Mainstream Rock chart – \"Devil's Radio\", \"This Is Love\" and \"Cloud 9\".\n\nIn 1988, Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. The band had gathered in Dylan's garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release. Harrison's record company decided the track, \"Handle with Care\", was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album. The LP, \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\", was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr. It reached number 16 in the UK and number 3 in the US, where it was certified triple platinum. Harrison's pseudonym on the album was \"Nelson Wilbury\"; he used the name \"Spike Wilbury\" for their second album.\n\nIn 1989, Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Petty's song \"I Won't Back Down\". In October that year, Harrison assembled and released \"Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989\", a compilation of his later solo work. The album included three new songs, including \"Cheer Down\", which Harrison had recently contributed to the \"Lethal Weapon 2\" film soundtrack.\n\nFollowing Orbison's death in December 1988, the Wilburys recorded as a four-piece. Their second album, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\". According to Lynne, \"That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'\" It peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US, where it was certified platinum. The Wilburys never performed live, and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.\n\nIn December 1991, Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan. It was Harrison's first since 1974 and no others followed. On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall, his first London performance since the Beatles' 1969 rooftop concert. In October 1992, he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City, playing alongside Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn, Petty and Neil Young.\n\nIn 1994 Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney, Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the \"Beatles Anthology\" project. This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, \"Free as a Bird\" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, \"Real Love\". Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. He later commented on the project: \"I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when I'm dead, make them into hit songs.\"\n\nFollowing the \"Anthology\" project, Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latter's \"Chants of India\". Harrison's final television appearance was a VH-1 special to promote the album, taped in May 1997. Soon afterwards, Harrison was diagnosed with throat cancer; he was treated with radiotherapy, which was thought at the time to be successful. He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illness.\n\nIn January 1998, Harrison attended Carl Perkins' funeral in Jackson, Tennessee, where he performed a brief rendition of Perkins' song \"Your True Love\". In May, he represented the Beatles at London's High Court in their successful bid to gain control of unauthorised recordings made of a 1962 performance by the band at the Star-Club in Hamburg. The following year, he was the most active of his former bandmates in promoting the reissue of their 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\".\nOn 30 December 1999, Harrison and his wife were attacked at their home, Friar Park. Michael Abram, a 34-year-old man suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp. Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalised with more than 40 stab wounds, and part of his punctured lung was removed. He released a statement soon afterwards regarding his assailant: \"He wasn't a burglar, and he certainly wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys. Adi Shankara, an Indian historical, spiritual and groovy-type person, once said, 'Life is fragile like a raindrop on a lotus leaf.' And you'd better believe it.\"\n\nIn May 2001, it was revealed that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut short his stay in order to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: \"Do you want me to come with you?\" In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City for non-small cell lung cancer which had spread to his brain. When the news was made public, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages. On 12 November in New York, Harrison, Starr and McCartney came together for the last time.\n\nOn 29 November 2001, Harrison died at a friend's home in Los Angeles, aged 58. He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his funeral was held at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, California. His close family scattered his ashes according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Varanasi, India. He left almost £100 million in his will.\n\nHarrison's final album, \"Brainwashed\" (2002), was released posthumously after it was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne. A quotation from the \"Bhagavad Gita\" is included in the album's liner notes: \"There never was a time when you or I did not exist. Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be.\" A media-only single, \"Stuck Inside a Cloud\", which Leng described as \"a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality\", achieved number 27 on \"Billboard\"s Adult Contemporary chart. The single \"Any Road\", released in May 2003, peaked at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Marwa Blues\" went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, while \"Any Road\" was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nHarrison's guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative, such as using a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the \"Rubber Soul\" album and \"Here Comes the Sun\", to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was \"clearly an innovator\" as he was \"taking certain elements of R&B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique\". \"Rolling Stone\" founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as \"a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song\". The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles' recordings. He identified Chuck Berry as another early influence.\n\nIn 1961 the Beatles recorded \"Cry for a Shadow\", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows. Harrison's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins. Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on \"I'll Be on My Way\".\n\nBy 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on \"A Hard Day's Night\". On this and other songs from the period, he used a Rickenbacker 360/12 – an electric guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart, with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. His use of the Rickenbacker on \"A Hard Day's Night\" helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that \"Melody Maker\" termed it the Beatles' \"secret weapon\". In 1965 Harrison used an expression pedal to control his guitar's volume on \"I Need You\", creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements. He used the same volume-swell technique on \"Yes It Is\", applying what Everett described as \"ghostly articulation\" to the song's natural harmonics.\n\nIn 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to \"Revolver\". He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and a guitar counter-melody on \"And Your Bird Can Sing\" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on \"I Want to Tell You\" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for \"Sgt Pepper\"s \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.\n\nEverett described Harrison's guitar solo from \"Old Brown Shoe\" as \"stinging [and] highly Claptonesque\". He identified two of the composition's significant motifs: a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song \"a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo\". In Greene's opinion, Harrison's demo for \"Old Brown Shoe\" contains \"one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song\".\n\nHarrison's playing on \"Abbey Road\", and in particular on \"Something\", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas. According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: \"'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime\".\n\nAfter Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the dilruba. Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's \"How Do You Sleep?\" as a departure for \"the sweet soloist of 'Something'\", calling his playing \"rightly famed ... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements\". Lennon commented: \"That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life.\"\n\nA Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on \"Gone Troppo\" (1982) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard \"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\" on ukulele in 1992. Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Marwa Blues\" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena, calling it \"yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach\". Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of \"Free as a Bird\". He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society. Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks, including the Beatles songs \"She Said She Said\", \"Golden Slumbers\", \"Birthday\" and \"Honey Pie\". He also played bass on several solo recordings, including \"Faster\", \"Wake Up My Love\" and \"Bye Bye Love\".\n\nDuring the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Harrison described Shankar as \"the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me.\" Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music. According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles' song \"Norwegian Wood\" \"opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966–67\". Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as \"the man most responsible for this phenomenon\".\n\nIn June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted. Before this meeting, Harrison had recorded his \"Revolver\" track \"Love You To\", contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an \"astonishing improvement\" over \"Norwegian Wood\" and \"the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician\". On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi. In September, following the Beatles' final tour, he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar. He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in Kashmir. During this visit, he also received tutelage from Shambhu Das, Shankar's protégé.\n\nHarrison studied the instrument until 1968, when, following a discussion with Shankar about the need to find his \"roots\", an encounter with Clapton and Jimi Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented: \"I decided ... I'm not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier.\" Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre. Lavezzoli groups him with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel as the three rock musicians who have given the most \"mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of 'world music'\".\n\nHarrison wrote his first song, \"Don't Bother Me\", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as \"an exercise to see if I \"could\" write a song\", as he remembered. His songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: \"Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours\". Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on \"Revolver\", \"the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter\", according to Inglis.\n\nHarrison wrote the chord progression of \"Don't Bother Me\" almost exclusively in the Dorian mode, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The latter proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to Mikal Gilmore of \"Rolling Stone\", \"Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on ... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Varèse and Igor Stravinsky ...\"\n\nOf the 1967 Harrison song \"Within You Without You\", author Gerry Farrell said that Harrison had created a \"new form\", calling the composition \"a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music\". Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: \"His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together.\" In his next fully Indian-styled song, \"The Inner Light\", Harrison embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music, rather than the Hindustani style he had used in \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\". Writing in 1997, Farrell commented: \"It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion – for example, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'The Inner Light'.\"\n\nBeatles biographer Bob Spitz described \"Something\" as a masterpiece, and \"an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced\". Inglis considered \"Abbey Road\" a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's two contributions to the LP, \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", as \"exquisite\", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.\n\nFrom 1968 onwards, Harrison collaborated with other musicians; he brought in Eric Clapton to play lead guitar on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" for the 1968 Beatles' White Album, and collaborated with John Barham on his 1968 debut solo album, \"Wonderwall Music\", which included contributions from Clapton again, as well as Peter Tork from the Monkees. He played on tracks by Dave Mason, Nicky Hopkins, Alvin Lee, Ronnie Wood, Billy Preston and Tom Scott. Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan, Clapton, Preston, Doris Troy, David Bromberg, Gary Wright, Wood, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, among others. Harrison's music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy, Jackie Lomax and Billy Preston.\n\nHarrison co-wrote the song \"Badge\" with Clapton, which was included on Cream's 1969 album, \"Goodbye\". Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track, using the pseudonym \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for contractual reasons. In May 1970 he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylan's album \"New Morning\". Between 1971 and 1973 he co-wrote and/or produced three top ten hits for Starr: \"It Don't Come Easy\", \"Back Off Boogaloo\" and \"Photograph\". Aside from \"How Do You Sleep?\", his contributions to Lennon's 1971 album \"Imagine\" included a slide guitar solo on \"Gimme Some Truth\" and dobro on \"Crippled Inside\". Also that year, he produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger's top ten hit \"Day After Day\", and a dobro on Preston's \"I Wrote a Simple Song\". He worked with Harry Nilsson on \"You're Breakin' My Heart\" (1972) and with Cheech & Chong on \"Basketball Jones\" (1973).\n\nIn 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Eric Idle commented: \"He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of.\" The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and the duo Splinter. Harrison produced and made multiple musical contributions to Splinter's debut album, \"The Place I Love\", which provided Dark Horse with its first hit, \"Costafine Town\". He also produced and played guitar and autoharp on Shankar's \"Shankar Family & Friends\", the label's other inaugural release. Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva and Stairsteps.\n\nHarrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scott's 1975 album \"New York Connection\", and in 1981 he played guitar on \"Walk a Thin Line\", from Mick Fleetwood's \"The Visitor\". His contributions to Starr's solo career continued with \"Wrack My Brain\", a 1981 US top 40 hit written and produced by Harrison, and guitar overdubs to two tracks on \"Vertical Man\" (1998). In 1996 Harrison recorded \"Distance Makes No Difference With Love\" with Carl Perkins for the latter's album \"Go Cat Go!\", and in 1990 he played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan's \"Under the Red Sky\" album. In 2001 he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra's comeback album \"Zoom\", and on the song \"Love Letters\" for Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, \"Horse to the Water\", which was recorded on 2 October, eight weeks before his death. It appeared on Jools Holland's album \"Small World, Big Band\".\n\nWhen Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for \"Cloud Nine\". He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on \"She Loves You\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the \"Help!\" album that February; he also used it when recording \"Rubber Soul\" later that year, most notably on the song \"Nowhere Man\".\n\nIn early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on \"Revolver\". Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \"Bebopalula\" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \"Rocky\", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul, which Harrison nicknamed \"Lucy\". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a \"Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison.\n\nHarrison helped finance Ravi Shankar's documentary \"Raga\" and released it through Apple Films in 1971. He also produced, with Apple manager Allen Klein, the \"Concert for Bangladesh\" film. In 1973, he produced the feature film \"Little Malcolm\", but the project was lost amid the litigation surrounding the former Beatles ending their business ties with Klein.\n\nIn 1973 Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis O'Brien. Soon after, the two went into business together. In 1978, in an effort to produce \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\", they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their chief executive, Bernard Delfont. Harrison financed the production of \"Life of Brian\" in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called \"the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history\". The film grossed $21 million at the box office in the US. The first film distributed by HandMade Films was \"The Long Good Friday\" (1980), and the first they produced was \"Time Bandits\" (1981), a co-scripted project by Monty Pythons Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin. The film featured a new song by Harrison, \"Dream Away\", in the closing credits. \"Time Bandits\" became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.\n\nHarrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade, including \"A Private Function\", \"Mona Lisa\", \"Shanghai Surprise\", \"Withnail and I\" and \"How to Get Ahead in Advertising\". He made cameo appearances in several of these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in \"Shanghai Surprise\", for which he recorded five new songs. According to Ian Inglis, Harrison's \"executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country's most memorable movies of the 1980s.\" Following a series of box office bombs in the late 1980s, and excessive debt incurred by O'Brien which was guaranteed by Harrison, HandMade's financial situation became precarious. The company ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment, a Canadian corporation. Afterwards, Harrison sued O'Brien for $25 million for fraud and negligence, resulting in an $11.6 million judgement in 1996.\n\nHarrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. In early 1971, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison hastily wrote and recorded the song \"Bangla Desh\", which became pop music's first charity single when issued by Apple Records in late July. He also pushed Apple to release Shankar's \"Joi Bangla\" EP in an effort to raise further awareness for the cause.<ref name=\"Dooley/Gibson\"></ref> Shankar asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US. Harrison responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000. Around $13.5 million was generated through the album and film releases, although most of the funds were frozen in an Internal Revenue Service audit for ten years, due to Klein's failure to register the event as a UNICEF benefit beforehand. In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar, and Klein, with the \"Child Is the Father of Man\" award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.\n\nFrom 1980, Harrison became a vocal supporter of Greenpeace and CND. He also protested against the use of nuclear energy with Friends of the Earth, and helped finance \"Vole\", a green magazine launched by Monty Python member Terry Jones. In 1990, he helped promote his wife Olivia's Romanian Angel Appeal on behalf of the thousands of Romanian orphans left abandoned by the state following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. Harrison recorded a benefit single, \"Nobody's Child\", with the Traveling Wilburys, and assembled a fundraising album with contributions from other artists including Clapton, Starr, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Donovan and Van Morrison.\n\nThe Concert for Bangladesh has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid. The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF, a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF, aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies. In December 2007, they donated $450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh. On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.\n\nBy the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of \"Help!\" in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, \"The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga\". Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the \"Sgt Pepper\" recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\"\n\nIn line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors, respectively, of \"Raja Yoga\" and \"Autobiography of a Yogi\". In mid-1969, he produced the single \"Hare Krishna Mantra\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as \"my friend ... my master\" and \"a perfect example of everything he preached\". Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly \"japa-yoga\" chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.\n\nRegarding other faiths he once remarked: \"All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call.\" He commented on his beliefs:\n\nBefore his religious conversion, the only British performer known for similar activities had been Cliff Richard, whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public. \"By contrast,\" wrote Inglis, \"Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity ... what he, and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs.\"\n\nHarrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film \"A Hard Day's Night\", in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife Maureen, which Boyd called \"the final straw\". She characterised the last year of their marriage as \"fuelled by alcohol and cocaine\", and she stated: \"George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart.\" She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.\n\nHarrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978. They had met at the A&M Records offices in Los Angeles in 1974, and together had one son, Dhani Harrison, born on 1 August 1978.\n\nHe restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including \"Crackerbox Palace\"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of \"All Things Must Pass\". He employed ten workers to maintain the garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism: \"Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'\" His autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", is dedicated \"to gardeners everywhere\". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: \"George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life.\"\n\nHarrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12 he had attended his first race, the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree. He wrote \"Faster\" as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson. Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity, set up after the Swedish driver's death from the disease in 1978. Harrison's first extravagant car, a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London. An anonymous Beatles collector paid £350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.\n\nFor most of the Beatles' career the relationships in the group were close. According to Hunter Davies, \"the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends.\" Harrison's ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles \"all belonged to each other\" and admitted, \"George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it.\" Starr said, \"We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other\". He added, \"there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational.\"\n\nLennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was \"one of young follower and older guy ... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started.\" The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: \"John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a \"bastard\" – but that's the great thing about him, you see?\"\n\nHarrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together. McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring. McCartney has referred to Harrison as his \"baby brother\". In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman, Harrison stated: \"[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player\". Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves. Rodriguez commented: \"Even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship\".\n\nIn June 1965, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film \"Let It Be\". The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's \"critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music\" and for his having \"advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music\". \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".\n\nIn 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as \"one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced\", was among the performers of Monty Python's \"Lumberjack Song\". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.\n\nIn 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.\n\nA documentary film entitled \"\", directed by Martin Scorsese, was released in October 2011. The film features interviews with Olivia and Dhani Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Terry Gilliam, Starr, Clapton, McCartney, Keltner and Astrid Kirchherr.\n\nHarrison was posthumously honoured with The Recording Academy's Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammy Awards in February 2015.\n\n\nCitations\nSources\n\n\n"}

Lee\n\nGeorge Patrick Lee (March 23, 1943 – July 28, 2010) was the first Native American to become a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was a member of the church's First Quorum of Seventy from 1975 to 1989, when he was excommunicated from the church.\n\nLee was born in Towaoc, Colorado, to Mae K. Lee () of the clan, and to a Medicine Man, Peter Lee (), of the Under the Flat-Roofed House People clan. One of 17 children from his parents' marriages, Lee was called (Little Boy), until he was given a sacred name, (Boy Who is Well Behaved and Good).\n\nWhen he was 12 years old, Lee became one of the first children to participate in an official Indian foster placement program sponsored by the LDS Church. Lee was transported to Orem, Utah, where he lived with the Glen and Joan Harker family. Lee remained in their home for seven years, returning to his Navajo family during summer vacations, until he graduated from Orem High School in 1962.\n\nLee attended Brigham Young University, where he earned a bachelor's degree and later a doctorate in Educational Administration, and Utah State University, where he completed a master's degree. In Arizona, Lee taught at the Rough Rock Demonstration School and later served as president of the Ganado campus of Diné College. Lee married Katherine Hettich and they became the parents of seven children.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Lee served as a missionary for the LDS Church to the Navajo Nation, known then as the \"Southwest Indian Mission\".\n\nPrior to his call as an LDS general authority, Lee held a number of priesthood leadership callings, including elders quorum president, branch president, district president, and president of the Arizona Holbrook Mission.\n\nOn October 3, 1975, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball called the 32-year-old Lee to be a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, a position with church-wide responsibilities. He was the first Native American general authority in church history.\n\nOn September 1, 1989, the Church announced that Lee had been excommunicated for \"apostasy and other conduct unbecoming a member of the Church.\" He was the first general authority to be excommunicated since 1943, when apostle Richard R. Lyman was excommunicated for adultery and unlawful cohabitation.\n\nAccording to Lee, the action stemmed from his disagreement with LDS Church president Ezra Taft Benson over the role of Native Americans in the church. When he became church president, Benson had ended the church's Indian Placement Program, which Lee cited as a key to his personal development. Lee argued that Benson was not treating Native American Latter-day Saints in the way that Kimball would have approved. Additionally, Lee claimed the First Presidency had accused him of polygamy, immorality and teaching false doctrine. Lee provided copies of letters he had written to leaders of the LDS Church to the news media. The church did not publicly respond to Lee's letters or his public comments; it is the policy of the church not to publicize the details of an excommunicant's behavior which brought about the disciplinary action.\n\nIn 1993, the \"Salt Lake Tribune\" reported that Lee had attempted to sexually molest a minor girl in 1989, and that this was one of the reasons for Lee's excommunication. Initially, Lee denied the charges; however, on October 12, 1994, the \"Tribune\" reported:\n\nOn July 27, 2007, Lee was arrested in Washington County, Utah, for failing to register as a sex offender in the state of Utah. The police reported that Lee had not registered since 2001 and that he had been \"living in an area with several young children in close proximity.\" Lee was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility in Hurricane, Utah on $5,000 bail. The case dragged on for many months due to Lee's health issues. On March 19, 2008 the case was formally dropped due to these issues and Lee eventually registered with the sex offender registry. One year later, on March 29, 2009, Lee was removed from Utah's sex offender registry.\n\nLee died in Provo, Utah on July 28, 2010, from \"a long battle with physical problems\". After his death, Latter-day Saint sociologist Armand Mauss described Lee as \"one of the truly tragic figures in modern Mormon history\".\n\n\n\n"}

While she was a teenager, she became interested in the Rastafarian movement, sweeping through the Caribbean after Haile Selassie's 1966 visit to the region and Bob Marley's music added visibility to the ideology. She joined the movement in 1980, changed her name to Ijahnya Christian, and went on to study social work at the University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1984. \n\nReturning to Anguilla, Christian began her career as a high school teacher.

{"id": "870284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=870284", "title": "J. Allen Hynek", "text": "J. Allen Hynek\n\nJosef Allen Hynek (May 1, 1910 – April 27, 1986) was an American astronomer, professor, and ufologist. He is perhaps best remembered for his UFO research. Hynek acted as scientific advisor to UFO studies undertaken by the U.S. Air Force under three consecutive projects: Project Sign (1947–1949), Project Grudge (1949–1952), and Project Blue Book (1952–1969).\n\nIn later years he conducted his own independent UFO research, developing the \"Close Encounter\" classification system. He is widely considered the father of the concept of scientific analysis both of reports and especially of trace evidence purportedly left by UFOs.\n\nHynek was born in Chicago to Czech parents. In 1931, Hynek received a B.S. from the University of Chicago. In 1935, he completed his Ph.D. in astrophysics at Yerkes Observatory. He joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio State University in 1936. He specialized in the study of stellar evolution and in the identification of spectroscopic binary stars.\n\nDuring World War II, Hynek was a civilian scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where he helped to develop the United States Navy's radio proximity fuze.\n\nAfter the war, Hynek returned to the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio State, rising to full professor in 1950. In 1953, Hynek submitted a report on the fluctuations in the brightness and color of starlight and daylight, with an emphasis on daytime observations.\n\nIn 1956, he left to join Professor Fred Whipple, the Harvard astronomer, at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, which had combined with the Harvard Observatory at Harvard. Hynek had the assignment of directing the tracking of an American space satellite, a project for the International Geophysical Year in 1956 and thereafter. In addition to over 200 teams of amateur scientists around the world that were part of Operation Moonwatch, there were also 12 photographic Baker-Nunn stations. A special camera was devised for the task and a prototype was built and tested and then stripped apart again when, on Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, Sputnik 1.\n\nAfter completing his work on the satellite program, Hynek went back to teaching, taking the position of professor and chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University in 1960.\n\nIn response to numerous reports of \"flying saucers\", the United States Air Force established Project Sign in 1948 to examine sightings of unidentified flying objects. Hynek was contacted to act as a scientific consultant to Project Sign. He studied UFO reports and decided whether the phenomena described therein suggested known astronomical objects.\n\nWhen Project Sign hired Hynek, he was skeptical of UFO reports. Hynek suspected that they were made by unreliable witnesses, or by persons who had misidentified man-made or natural objects. In 1948, Hynek said that \"the whole subject seems utterly ridiculous,\" and described it as a fad that would soon pass.\n\nFor the first few years of his UFO studies, Hynek could safely be described as a debunker. He thought that a great many UFOs could be explained as prosaic phenomena misidentified by an observer. In his 1977 book, Hynek admitted that he enjoyed his role as a debunker for the Air Force. He also noted that debunking was what the Air Force expected of him.\n\nHynek's opinions about UFOs began a slow and gradual shift. After examining hundreds of UFO reports over the decades (including some made by credible witnesses, including astronomers, pilots, police officers, and military personnel), Hynek concluded that some reports represented genuine empirical evidence.\n\nAnother shift in Hynek's opinions came after conducting an informal poll of his astronomer colleagues in the early 1950s. Among those he queried was Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet Pluto. Of 44 astronomers, five (over 11 percent) had seen aerial objects that they could not account for with established, mainstream science. Most of these astronomers had not widely shared their accounts for fear of ridicule or of damage to their reputations or careers (Tombaugh was an exception, having openly discussed his own UFO sightings). Hynek also noted that this 11% figure was, according to most polls, greater than those in the general public who claimed to have seen UFOs. Furthermore, the astronomers were presumably more knowledgeable about observing and evaluating the skies than the general public, so their observations were arguably more impressive. Hynek was also distressed by what he regarded as the dismissive or arrogant attitude of many mainstream scientists towards UFO reports and witnesses.\n\nEarly evidence of the shift in Hynek's opinions appeared in 1953, when Hynek wrote an article for the April 1953 issue of the \"Journal of the Optical Society of America\" titled \"Unusual Aerial Phenomena,\" which contained what would become perhaps Hynek's best known statement:\nRidicule is not part of the scientific method, and people should not be taught that it is. The steady flow of reports, often made in concert by \"reliable\" observers, raises questions of scientific obligation and responsibility. Is there ... \"any\" residue that is worthy of scientific attention? Or, if there isn't, does not an obligation exist to say so to the public—not in words of open ridicule but seriously, to keep faith with the trust the public places in science and scientists?\n\nIn 1953, Hynek was an associate member of the Robertson Panel, which concluded that there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and that a public relations campaign should be undertaken to debunk the subject and reduce public interest. Hynek would later lament that the Robertson Panel had helped make UFOs a disreputable field of study.\n\nWhen the UFO reports continued at a steady pace, Hynek devoted some time to studying the reports and determined that some were deeply puzzling, even after considerable study. He once said, \"As a scientist I must be mindful of the lessons of the past; all too often it has happened that matters of great value to science were overlooked because the new phenomenon did not fit the accepted scientific outlook of the time.\"\n\nIn a 1985 interview, when asked what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, \"Two things, really. One was the completely negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, even if they were flying up and down the street in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe there was something to all this.\"\n\nRegardless of his own private views, Hynek was, by and large, still echoing the post-Ruppelt line of Project Blue Book: There are no UFOs, and reports can largely be explained as misidentifications.\n\nHynek remained with Project Sign after it became Project Grudge (though he was far less involved in Grudge than he had been in Sign). Project Grudge was replaced with Project Blue Book in early 1952, and Hynek remained as scientific consultant. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, Blue Book's first director, held Hynek in high regard: \"Dr. Hynek was one of the most impressive scientists I met while working on the UFO project, and I met a good many. He didn't do two things that some of them did: give you the answer before he knew the question; or immediately begin to expound on his accomplishments in the field of science.\"\n\nThough Hynek thought Ruppelt was a capable director who steered Project Blue Book in the right direction, Ruppelt headed Blue Book for only a few years. Hynek has also stated his opinion that after Ruppelt's departure, Project Blue Book was little more than a public relations exercise, further noting that little or no research was undertaken using the scientific method.\n\nHynek began occasionally disagreeing publicly with the conclusions of Blue Book. By the early 1960s—after about a decade and a half of study—Clark writes that \"Hynek's apparent turnaround on the UFO question was an open secret.\" Only after Blue Book was formally dissolved did Hynek speak more openly about his \"turnaround\".\n\nBy his own admission, the soft-spoken Hynek was cautious and conservative by nature. He speculated that his personality was a factor in the Air Force keeping him on as a consultant for over two decades.\n\nSome other ufologists thought that Hynek was being disingenuous or even duplicitous in his turnaround. Physicist James E. McDonald, for example, wrote to Hynek in 1970, castigating him for what McDonald saw as his lapses, and suggesting that, when evaluated by later generations, retired Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe would be regarded as a more objective, honest, and scientific ufologist.\n\nIt was during the late stages of Blue Book in the 1960s that Hynek began speaking openly about his disagreements and disappointments with the Air Force. Among the cases about which he openly dissented with the Air Force were the highly publicized Portage County UFO chase, in which several police officers chased a UFO for half an hour, and the encounter of Lonnie Zamora, a police officer who reported an encounter with a metallic, egg-shaped aircraft near Socorro, New Mexico.\n\nIn late March 1966 in Michigan, two days of mass UFO sightings were reported, and received significant publicity. After studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis for some of the sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken swamp gas for something more spectacular. At the press conference where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the Michigan UFO reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term \"swamp gas\" was repeated ad infinitum in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to national derision.\n\nIn his reply dated October 7, 1968, to a request for scientific recommendations regarding Blue Book from Colonel Raymond Sleeper, commander of the USAF Foreign Technology Division, Hynek noted that Blue Book suffered from numerous procedural problems and a lack of resources, which rendered its efforts \"totally inadequate\". Hynek also noted that one wag had bestowed upon Blue Book the epithet of \"Society for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated\".\n\nHynek was the founder and first head of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Founded in 1973 in Evanston, Illinois (but now based in Chicago), CUFOS advocates for scientific analysis of UFO cases. CUFOS's extensive archives include valuable files from civilian research groups such as NICAP, one of the most popular and credible UFO research groups of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn November 1978, Hynek presented a statement on UFOs before the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of himself, Jacques Vallée, and Claude Poher. The speech was prepared and approved by the three authors. Their objective was to initiate a centralized, United Nations authority on UFOs.\n\nAt the MUFON annual symposium in 1973, held in Akron, Ohio, Hynek first expressed his doubts regarding the extraterrestrial (formerly \"interplanetary\" or \"intergalactic\") hypothesis, in a speech titled \"The Embarrassment of the Riches\". He was aware that the number of UFO sightings was much higher than was reflected in the Project Blue Book statistics. \"A few good sightings a year, over the world, would bolster the extraterrestrial hypothesis—but many thousands every year? From remote regions of space? And to what purpose? To scare us by stopping cars, and disturbing animals, and puzzling us with their seemingly pointless antics?\"\n\nIn a paper presented to the Joint Symposium of the American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics in Los Angeles in 1975, he wrote, \"If you object, I ask you to explain—quantitatively, not qualitatively—the reported phenomena of materialization and dematerialization, of shape changes, of the noiseless hovering in the Earth's gravitational field, accelerations that—for an appreciable mass—require energy sources far beyond present capabilities—even theoretical capabilities, the well-known and often reported E-M (sc. electro-magnetic interference) effect, the psychic effects on percipients, including purported telepathic communications.\"\n\nIn 1977, at the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, Hynek presented his thoughts in his speech \"What I Really Believe About UFOs\". \"I do believe\", he said, \"that the UFO phenomenon as a whole is real, but I do not mean necessarily that it's just one thing. We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate in the atmosphere\", or whether they differ \"as a rain shower differs from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower.\" We must not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.\n\nRegarding hypotheses of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) and extradimensional intelligence (EDI), Hynek continued, \"There is sufficient evidence to defend both\". As evidence for the ETI hypothesis, he mentioned the cases involving radar as good evidence of something solid, as well as the cases of physical evidence. Then he turned to defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition to the observations of materialization and dematerialization, he cited the \"poltergeist\" phenomenon experienced by some people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front of witnesses; the puzzling question of telepathic communication; that in close encounters of the third kind, the creatures seem to be at home in Earth's gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness in the presence of the craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of psychic abilities after an encounter. \"Do we have two aspects of one phenomenon or two different sets of phenomena?\" Hynek asked.\n\nFinally, he introduced a third hypothesis. \"I hold it entirely possible\", he said, \"that a technology exists, which encompasses both the physical and the psychic, the material and the mental. There are stars that are millions of years older than the sun. There may be a civilization that is millions of years more advanced than man's. We have gone from Kitty Hawk to the moon in some seventy years, but it's possible that a million-year-old civilization may know something that we don't ... I hypothesize an 'M&M' technology encompassing the mental and material realms. The psychic realms, so mysterious to us today, may be an ordinary part of an advanced technology.\"\n\nIn Hynek and Vallee's 1975 book \"The Edge of Reality\", Hynek published a stereoscopic photograph of a UFO he took during a flight. According to the book, the object stayed in sight long enough for Hynek to unpack his camera from his luggage and take two exposures. UFO researcher Robert Sheaffer writes in his book \"Psychic Vibrations\" that Hynek seemed to have forgotten the photographs when he later told a reporter for \"The Globe and Mail\" that he had never seen a UFO. The article states that in all the years he had been looking upward, Hynek \"has never seen 'what I would so dearly love to see. Oh, the subject has been so ridiculed that I would never report a UFO even if I did see one—not without a witness'\".\n\nIn his first book, Hynek published the \"Close Encounter\" scale that he had developed to better catalog UFO reports. Hynek was later a consultant to Columbia Pictures and Steven Spielberg for the popular 1977 UFO movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", named after a level of Hynek's scale. He made a non-speaking cameo appearance in the film (at the end of the film, after the aliens disembark from the \"mother ship\", he can be seen, bearded and with pipe in mouth, stepping forward to view the spectacle).\n\nHynek and his wife, Miriam (Curtis) had five children. Hynek's son Joel is an Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor. He oversaw the design of the camouflage effect for the movie \"Predator\", and won the Best Visual Effects Oscar for his work on \"What Dreams May Come\".\n\nOn April 27, 1986, Hynek died of a malignant brain tumor, at Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was 75 years old, and was survived by his wife Mimi, children Scott, Roxane, Joel, Paul, and Ross, and his grandchildren.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "190288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190288", "title": "John Tavener", "text": "John Tavener\n\nSir John Kenneth Tavener (28 January 1944 – 12 November 2013) was an English composer, known for his extensive output of religious works, including \"The Protecting Veil\", \"Song for Athene\" and \"The Lamb\".\n\nTavener first came to prominence with his cantata \"The Whale\", premiered in 1968. Then aged 24, he was described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the musical discovery of the year\", while \"The Times\" said he was \"among the very best creative talents of his generation.\" During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for \"The Protecting Veil\", which as recorded by cellist Steven Isserlis became a bestselling album, and \"Song for Athene\" which was sung at the funeral of Princess Diana. \"The Lamb\" featured in the soundtrack for Paolo Sorrentino's film \"The Great Beauty\". Tavener was knighted in 2000 for his services to music and won an Ivor Novello Award.\n\nTavener was born on 28 January 1944 in Wembley, London. His parents ran a family building firm and his father was also an organist at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Frognal, Hampstead. At the age of 12, Tavener was taken to Glyndebourne to hear Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\", a work he loved for the rest of his life. That same year he heard Stravinsky’s most recent work, \"Canticum Sacrum\", which he later described as \"the piece that woke me up and made me want to be a composer\".\n\nTavener became a music scholar at Highgate School (where a fellow pupil was John Rutter). The school choir was often employed by the BBC in works requiring boys' voices, so Tavener gained choral experience singing in Mahler's Third Symphony and Orff's \"Carmina Burana\". He started to compose at Highgate, and also became a sufficiently proficient pianist to perform the second and third movements of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto and, in 1961 with the National Youth Orchestra, Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2. He also became organist and choirmaster in 1961 at St John's Presbyterian Church, Kensington (now St Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church), a post he held for 14 years.\n\nTavener entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1962, where his tutors included Sir Lennox Berkeley. During his studies there he decided to give up the piano and devote himself to composition.\n\nTavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata \"The Whale\", based on the Old Testament story of Jonah. It was premièred at the London Sinfonietta's début concert, which was also the opening concert of the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Tavener's younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on Ringo Starr's home and, gaining the musician's interest, persuaded the Beatles to have \"The Whale\" recorded by Apple Records and released in 1970. The following year Tavener began teaching at Trinity College of Music, London. Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his \"A Celtic Requiem\", which impressed Benjamin Britten enough to persuade Covent Garden to commission an opera from Tavener: the ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright Gerard McLarnon, was \"Thérèse\". When staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama.\n\nTavener had also been deeply affected by his brief 1974 marriage to the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou. His chamber opera \"A Gentle Spirit\" (1977), with a libretto by McLarnon based on a story by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, concerns a pawnbroker whose marriage fails to the extent that his wife commits suicide. It has been deemed \"far superior to \"Thérèse\", with the internal drama more suited to the stage\". Significantly, it also touched on Russian Orthodoxy, to which McLarnon had been a convert for several years.\n\nTavener converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977. Orthodox theology and liturgical traditions became a major influence on his work. He was particularly drawn to its mysticism, studying and setting to music the writings of Church Fathers and completing a setting of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the principal eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church: this was Tavener's first directly Orthodox-inspired music.\n\nTavener's subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in \"Akhmatova Requiem\": this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its Proms' performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished. Of more lasting success was Tavener's short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of William Blake's poem \"The Lamb\", written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon's third birthday. This simple homophonic piece is usually performed as a Christmas carol. Later prominent works include \"The Akathist of Thanksgiving\" of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; \"The Protecting Veil\", first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the London Symphony Orchestra at the 1989 Proms; and \"Song for Athene\" (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by Mother Thekla, a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011. \"Song for Athene\" in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.\n\nTavener's \"Fall and Resurrection\", first performed in 2000, used instruments such as ram's horn, ney flute and kaval. It was dedicated to the Prince of Wales, with whom Tavener formed a lasting friendship. In 2003 Tavener composed the exceptionally large work \"The Veil of the Temple\" (which was premièred at the Temple Church, London), based on texts from a number of religions. Identified by Tavener as \"the supreme achievement of my life\", it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours. \"Prayer of the Heart\", written for and performed by Björk, was premiered in 2004. In 2007 Tavener composed \"The Beautiful Names\", a setting of the 99 names of God in the Muslim tradition, sung in Arabic.\n\nIt had been reported, particularly in the British press, that Tavener left Orthodox Christianity to explore a number of other different religious traditions, including Hinduism and Islam, and became a follower of the Traditionalist philosopher Frithjof Schuon. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", conducted by British music journalist Michael White, Tavener said: \"I reached a point where everything I wrote was terribly austere and hidebound by the tonal system of the Orthodox Church, and I felt the need, in my music at least, to become more universalist: to take in other colors, other languages.\" The interviewer also reported at the time that he \"hasn’t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian.\" Speaking on the BBC Four television programme \"Sacred Music\" in 2010, Tavener described himself as \"essentially Orthodox\". He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on \"Start the Week\", recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11 November 2013.\n\nIn 1974 he married the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou, but it only lasted eight months. In 1991 he married Maryanna Schaefer with whom he had three children, Theodora, Sofia and Orlando. He suffered from considerable health problems throughout his life. He had a stroke in his thirties, heart surgery and the removal of a tumour in his forties, and suffered two successive heart attacks which left him very frail. He was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in 1990. Lady Tavener broadcast a charity appeal on BBC Radio 4 in October 2008 on behalf of the Marfan Trust.\n\nTavener had an interest in classic cars, owning an Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire, a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, a Jaguar XJ6 and a Bentley Mulsanne Turbo.\n\nTavener died, aged 69, on 12 November 2013 at his home in Child Okeford, Dorset. In the music world, composers John Rutter and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, cellist Steven Isserlis, Neil Portnow, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, Roger Wright, controller of BBC Radio 3 and director of the Proms, and soprano Patricia Rozario, paid tribute. A tribute was also received from Charles, Prince of Wales.\nTavener's funeral was held at the Anglican Cathedral in Winchester on 28 November 2013. The service was Orthodox, and presided over by Archbishop Gregorios of Thyateira, the representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch, and the most senior Orthodox bishop currently in the UK. Some 700 mourners attended.\n\nJohn Rutter describes Tavener as having the \"very rare gift\" of being able to \"bring an audience to a deep silence.\" According to Steven Isserlis, \"he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular – he was writing the music he had to write.\"\n\nWhile Tavener's earliest music was influenced by Igor Stravinsky and Olivier Messiaen – often invoking the sound world of Stravinsky, in particular \"Canticum Sacrum\", and the ecstatic quality found in various works by Messiaen – his later music became more sparse, using wide registral space and was usually diatonically tonal. Tavener recognised Arvo Pärt as \"a kindred spirit\" and shared with him a common religious tradition and a fondness for textural transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "971189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=971189", "title": "Johnny Ringo", "text": "Johnny Ringo\n\nJohn Peters Ringo (May 3, 1850 – July 13, 1882)—known as Johnny Ringo—was an American Old West outlaw loosely associated with the Cochise County Cowboys in frontier Tombstone, Cochise County, Arizona Territory, United States. He took part in the Mason County War during which he committed his first murder. He was arrested and charged with murder, but escaped from jail. He was affiliated with Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, Ike Clanton, and Frank Stilwell during 1881–1882. He got into a confrontation in Tombstone with Doc Holliday and was suspected by Wyatt Earp of having taken part in the attempted murder of Virgil Earp and the ambush and death of Morgan Earp. Ringo was found dead with a bullet wound to his temple. Modern writers have advanced various theories attributing his death to Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Frank Leslie, and Michael O'Rourke.\n\nJohnny Ringo was born in Greens Fork, Indiana, of distant Dutch ancestry. His family moved to Liberty, Missouri in 1856. He was a loosely related cousin to the Younger brothers through his aunt Augusta Peters Inskip, who married Coleman P. Younger, uncle of the outlaws.\n\nIn 1858, his family moved to Gallatin, Missouri where they rented property from the father of John W. Sheets (who became the first \"official\" victim of the James-Younger gang when they robbed the Daviess County Savings & Loan Association in 1869).\n\nOn July 30, 1864, when Johnny was 14, his family was in Wyoming en route to California. His father Martin Ringo was killed when he stepped off their wagon holding a shotgun which accidentally discharged. The buckshot entered the right side of Martin's face and exited the top of his head. The family buried Martin on a hillside alongside the trail.\n\nBy the mid-1870s, Ringo had migrated from San Jose, California, to Mason County, Texas. Here he befriended an ex-Texas Ranger named Scott Cooley, who was the adopted son of a local rancher named Tim Williamson.\n\nTrouble started when two American rustlers, Elijah and Pete Backus, were dragged from the Mason jail and lynched by a predominantly German mob. Full-blown war began on May 13, 1875, when Tim Williamson was arrested by a hostile posse and murdered by a German farmer named Peter “bad man” Bader. Cooley and his friends, including Johnny Ringo, conducted a terror campaign against their rivals. Officials called it the \"Mason County War\"; locally it was called the \"Hoodoo War\". Cooley retaliated by killing the local German ex-deputy sheriff, John Worley, shooting him, scalping him, and tossing his body down a well on August 10, 1875.\n\nCooley already had a reputation as a dangerous man, and was respected as a Texas Ranger. He killed several others during the \"war\". After Cooley supporter Moses Baird was killed, Ringo committed his first murder on September 25, 1875, when he and a friend named Bill Williams rode up in front of the house of James Cheyney, the man who led Baird into the ambush. Cheyney came out unarmed, invited them in, and began washing his face on the porch, when both Ringo and Williams shot and killed him. The two then rode to the house of Dave Doole and called him outside, but he came out with a gun so they fled back into town.\n\nSome time later, Scott Cooley and Johnny Ringo mistook Charley Bader for his brother Pete and killed him. After that, both men were jailed in Burnet, Texas by Sheriff A. J. Strickland. Both Ringo and Cooley were broken out of jail by their friends shortly thereafter, and parted company to evade the law.\n\nBy November 1876, the Mason County War had petered out after about a dozen individuals had been killed. Scott Cooley was thought to be dead, and Johnny Ringo and his pal George Gladden were locked up once again. One of Ringo's alleged cellmates was the notorious killer John Wesley Hardin. While Gladden was sentenced to 99 years, Ringo appears to have been acquitted. Two years later, Ringo was a constable in Loyal Valley, Texas. Soon after this, he traveled to Arizona for the first time.\n\nRingo first appeared in Cochise County, Arizona Territory in 1879 with Joseph Graves Olney (alias \"Joe Hill\"), a friend from the Mason County War. In December 1879, a drunk Ringo shot unarmed Louis Hancock in a Safford, Arizona saloon when Hancock refused a complimentary drink of whiskey, stating that he preferred beer. Hancock survived his wound. In Tombstone, Arizona, Ringo had a reputation as having a bad temper. He may have participated in robberies and killings with the Cochise County Cowboys, a loosely associated group of outlaws. He was occasionally erroneously referred to as \"Ringgold\" by local newspapers.\n\nOn January 17, 1882, Ringo and Doc Holliday traded threats and seemed to be headed into a gunfight. Both men were arrested by Tombstone's chief of police, James Flynn, and hauled before a judge for carrying weapons in town. Both were fined. Judge William H. Stilwell followed up on charges outstanding against Ringo for a robbery in Galeyville and Ringo was re-arrested and jailed on January 20 for the weekend. Ringo was suspected by the Earps of taking part in the December 28, 1881, ambush of Virgil Earp, that crippled him for life, and the March 18, 1882, murder of Morgan Earp while he was shooting pool in a Tombstone saloon.\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp and his posse killed Frank Stilwell in Tucson on March 20, 1882. After the shooting, the Earps and a federal posse set out on a vendetta to find and kill the others they held responsible for ambushing Virgil and Morgan. Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan received warrants from a Tucson judge for arrest of the Earps and Holliday and deputized Ringo and 19 other men, many of them friends of Stilwell and the Cochise County Cowboys. The county posse pursued but never found the Earps' posse.\n\nDuring the Earp Vendetta Ride, Wyatt Earp killed one of Ringo's closest friends, \"Curly Bill\" Brocius, in a gunfight at Iron Springs (later Mescal Springs) about from Tombstone. Earp told his biographer, Stuart Lake, that Cruz confessed to being the lookout at Morgan's murder, and identified Ringo, Stilwell, Swilling, and Brocius as Morgan's killers, though modern researchers have cast doubt on Earp's account.\n\nOn July 14, 1882, Ringo's body was found lying against the trunk of a large tree in West Turkey Creek Valley, near Chiricahua Peak in Arizona Territory. A neighboring property owner heard a single gunshot on the afternoon of July 13 and discovered Ringo's body the following day. His feet were wrapped in strips of cloth torn from his undershirt, probably because his horse had gotten loose from its picket and bolted with his boots tied to the saddle—a method commonly used at that time to keep scorpions out of them. There was a bullet hole in his right temple and an exit wound at the back of his head. His revolver had one round expended and was found hanging by one finger in his hand. His horse was found two miles away with his boots still tied to the saddle. A coroner's inquest officially ruled his death a suicide.\n\nRingo's body is buried near the base of the tree where it was discovered. The grave is located on private land and permission is needed to visit the site. Despite the coroner's ruling, and contemporaneous newspaper reports that \"[Ringo had] frequently threatened to commit suicide, and that the event was expected at any time\", alternative theories about Ringo's cause of death, of varying plausibility, have been proposed over the years by researchers and amateur enthusiasts.\n\nAccording to the book \"I Married Wyatt Earp\", which author and collector Glen Boyer claimed to have assembled from manuscripts written by Earp's third wife, Josephine Marcus Earp, Earp and Doc Holliday returned to Arizona with some friends in early July and found Ringo camped in West Turkey Creek Valley. As Ringo attempted to flee up the canyon, Earp shot him with a rifle. Boyer refused to produce his source manuscripts, and reporters wrote that his explanations were conflicting and not credible. \"New York Times\" contributor Allen Barra wrote that \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" \"...is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax.\" However, Tombstone historian Ben T. Traywick considers the Earp theory the most credible, as only Earp had sufficient motive, he was probably in the area at the time, and near the end of his life, reportedly told one historian \"in circumstantial detail how he killed John Ringo\".\n\nIn an interview with a reporter in Denver in 1896, Earp denied that he had killed Johnny Ringo. He then flipped his story, claiming he had killed Ringo. In 1888, he was interviewed by an agent of California historian Hubert H. Bancroft, and then Frank Lockwood, who wrote \"Pioneer Days in Arizona\" in 1932' He told them that he killed Johnny Ringo as he left Arizona in 1882. However, Earp included details that do not match what is known about Ringo's death. Earp repeated that claim to at least three other people.\n\nThe Holliday theory is similar to the Earp theory, except that Holliday is alleged to have killed Ringo. A variant, popularized in the movie \"Tombstone\", holds that Holliday stepped in for Earp in response to a gunfight challenge from Ringo and shot him. Records of the Pueblo County, Colorado District Court (located in Pueblo, Colorado) indicate that Holliday and his attorney appeared in court on July 11, 14, and 18, 1882 to answer charges of \"larceny\". However, a writ of capias was issued for him on the 11th, suggesting that he did not in fact appear in court on that date. Ringo's body was found on the 14th. Six days before Ringo's death, the \"Pueblo Daily Chieftain\" reported that Holliday was in Salida, Colorado, about from Turkey Creek, Arizona; and then in Leadville, about distant, on July 18. There was still an arrest warrant outstanding on Holliday in Arizona for his part in Frank Stilwell's murder, making it unlikely that he would have entered Arizona at that time.\n\nSome accounts attribute Ringo's death to Michael O'Rourke, an itinerant gambler who was arrested in Tucson in January 1881 on suspicion of murdering a mining engineer named Henry Schneider. Wyatt Earp is said to have protected him from being lynched by a mob organized and led by Ringo. O'Rourke escaped from jail in April 1881 and never stood trial on the murder charges.\n\nThe last documented sighting of O'Rourke was in the Dragoon Mountains near Tombstone during May 1881, \"well-mounted and equipped\", and presumably on his way out of the territory. From then on he is referenced only in unsubstantiated rumors and legends; according to one, a combination of the debt he owed Earp and the grudge he held against Ringo prompted him to return to Arizona in 1882, track Ringo down, and kill him. While some sources consider the story plausible, others point out that O'Rourke, like Holliday, would have been reluctant to re-enter Arizona with a murder warrant hanging over his head—particularly to commit another murder.\n\nA theory popular in the years immediately following Ringo's death named \"Buckskin\" Frank Leslie as his killer. Leslie apparently did tell a guard at the Yuma prison, where he was serving time for killing his wife, that he had shot Ringo. While many believed his story, others thought he was simply claiming credit for it to curry favor with Earp's inner circle, or for whatever notoriety it might bring him. In a popular but unsubstantiated story, Billy Claiborne's last words, after losing a gunfight to Leslie in November 1882, were, \"Frank Leslie killed John Ringo. I saw him do it.\"\n\nThe character of Johnny Ringo has been depicted in the following film and television shows.\n\n\n\"Confessions of Johnny Ringo\", a fictionalized memoir.

He is the leader of the hip-hop group HGA, and was signed as a solo artist to Reach Records in 2010. He is also a member of the Reach Records-based hip-hop collective 116 Clique. After releasing a mixtape in 2011 entitled \"Who Is KB?\", his debut album, \"Weight & Glory\", was released on July 17, 2012, to critical acclaim. On March 4, 2014 he released his first EP, \"100\". On April 21, 2015, he released his second album, \"Tomorrow We Live\". October 20, 2017 was the release of his third album, \"Today We Rebel\".\n\nKevin Elijah Burgess was born in St. Petersburg, Florida on July 21, 1988, into a military family. Shortly after his birth his parents moved to Southern Illinois where he was raised for eight years. When he was 8 years old, his parents divorced and he moved back with his mother to the south-side of St. Petersburg, which according to Burgess is \"probably one of the worst areas in the state.\" He did well in school and at age 15 was offered an opportunity to pursue college through a program called St. Petersburg Collegiate High School. But despite this opportunity, he struggled with extreme depression and experimented with various drugs to try to relieve it. He began struggling at school due to his problems with his personal life, and even contemplated suicide. Jeremy offered him a CD, and Burgess says he was saved after hearing the Gospel presentation on the recording.\n\nBurgess is currently married with two children.\n\nAfter high school, Burgess enrolled in Bible college and befriended a group of Christian rappers and together they formed a hip hop group called HGA, short for His Glory Alone. HGA eventually caught the interest of Lecrae, Ben Washer, and DJ Official, and were featured with Tedashii on the track \"Go\" from DJ Official's album \"Entermission\". Burgess was invited onto the “Acquire the Fire” tour by Lecrae, and was asked to join the Reach Records team just a few months later.\n\nBurgess signed with Reach Records in 2010, and appeared that year on the album \"Rehab\" by Lecrae. His mixtape \"Who is KB?\" followed a year later, as did appearances with PRo and Tedashii. \"Who is KB?\" garnered 30,000 downloads by the following year. His first single, \"Hello\", featured Suzy Rock and was released in October 2011. In January 2012, a second single, \"Zone Out\" featuring Chris Lee Cobbins, was released. Burgess then made an appearance with Andy Mineo on the Trip Lee album \"The Good Life\". A third single by Burgess, \"Go Off\", featured Tedashii and Andy Mineo, and was released in June. The following month, his debut album \"Weight & Glory\" was released.\n\nOn May 30, 2013, Reach announced a four-part project entitled \"1st & 16th\". This project would consist of Burgess releasing a new song every first and sixteenth of June and July. On June 1, Part 1, \"HCB Freestyle\" was released. The songs \"Ride\" and \"Be All Right\" were also part of the 1st and 16th project.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, KB announced his new project, an EP entitled \"100\", which was released on March 4, 2014. Burgess appeared in Family Force 5 music video for the song \"BZRK\", released on May 23, 2014, on which Burgess is a featured artist.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, KB took to social media to reveal his second studio album, \"Tomorrow We Live\", along with the cover and release date. It's scheduled to be released on April 21, 2015. The first single off the album \"Sideways\" featuring Lecrae was released on February 23, 2015. The second single \"Crowns & Thorns (Oceans)\" was released on March 10, 2015.\n\nOn October 20, 2017, KB released his third studio album \"Today We Rebel\".

The regular creation of knights of Saint Patrick lasted until 1921, when most of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State. While the Order technically still exists, no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936, and the last surviving knight, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, died in 1974. The Queen, however, remains the Sovereign of the Order. The position of King of Arms of the order was held by Ulster King of Arms; this office still exists, since 1943 it has been combined with Norroy King of Arms. St Patrick is patron of the order; its motto is \"Quis separabit?\", Latin for \"Who will separate us?\": an allusion to the Vulgate translation of Romans 8:35, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\"\n\nThe first appointments were made on 11 March 1783, and consisted of 15 Knight Founders, and in total there have been 145 appointments. The original Royal Warrant (dated 5 February 1783) specified that there were to be no more than fifteen knights of the Order at any one time, something that changed in 1821 when George IV appointed an extra six knights (although the royal warrant was not altered to reflect this change until 1830). William IV appointed an additional four knights at his coronation, and on 24 January 1833 increased the maximum number of knights to 22.\n\n"}

{"id": "33826828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33826828", "title": "Maria Roda", "text": "Maria Roda\n\nMaria Roda (1877–1958) was an Italian American anarchist-feminist activist, speaker and writer, who participated in the labor struggles among textile workers in Italy and the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBorn in 1877 in Como, Italy, Maria Roda was an activist in radical social movements from a young age. Her mother, Adele Parravicini, died when Roda was young, leaving her and her three sisters in the care of their father, Cesare Roda Balzarini, a weaver and activist in the local anarchist-inspired labor movements. After her mother's death, Roda and her sisters worked in the silk mills of Como. It was through the influence of her radical father and the contacts she made at the mills that she became an anarchist. The Italian government considered Cesare Roda to be one of the main anarchists in Como with connections to others in the movement abroad, and they monitored his activities and those of Maria throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nIn 1891, Maria Roda was arrested and sent to prison for three months for her involvement in a labor strike in Milan. Roda had been accused of inciting the strikers to riot against the police. She became famous among European activists for her spirit and her willingness to speak her mind. Even though she was only fourteen years old, she received this harsh sentence because of her defiant attitude towards the judge. When questioned about her role in inciting the riot by taunting a police officer, she said, \"I pity [that] guard. I pity him because he barely earns his bread, because he's a poor devil. But it impresses me to see him go after other poor devils, his brothers...let him think about this.\"\n\nThe Roda family immigrated to the United States in 1893 when Maria was 17. They settled in Paterson, New Jersey, and quickly became active in the anarchist milieu there through one of the largest and more influential anarchist groups in the United States, Gruppo Diritto all'Esistenza (Right to an Existence Group). Frustrated by the marginalization of women within the movement, Maria Roda and a few of the other activist women (including Ninfa Baronio and Ernestina Cravello) formed the Gruppo Emancipazione della Donna (Women's Emancipation Group) in 1897, so women in the anarchist movement could meet on their own and develop their own theories and methods of revolutionary working-class activism. As a result, Maria Roda and dozens of other women wrote, published and circulated anarchist-feminist writing through this and similar women's groups. Two of Roda's essays were published in \"La Questione Sociale\" (the Italian-language anarchist newspaper that was published in Paterson): \"Alle operaie\" (To women workers), September 15, 1897, and \"Alle Madri\" (To mothers), September 7, 1901.\n\nEmma Goldman first heard Maria Roda give a speech at a large rally in 1894 at the Thalia Theater in Manhattan, which celebrated Goldman's release from prison. Although it was in Italian and Goldman understood none of it, she wrote in her memoir how she was moved by Roda's charismatic presence. Goldman wrote, \"Maria's strange beauty and the music of her speech roused the whole assembly to tensest enthusiasm. Maria proved a veritable ray of sunlight to me.\" She then pledged to become Maria Roda's \"teacher, friend, comrade.\"\n\nRoda's lifelong partner was Pedro Esteve, a Catalan anarchist, printer, typesetter, and newspaper editor who helped to establish \"La Questione Sociale\", one of the main Italian language anarchist newspapers in the US. When Esteve was editor of \"La Questione Sociale\", from 1899 to 1906, women's writing was at its peak in the paper. While Roda and Esteve were based in Paterson until at least 1908, they also lived in Tampa, Florida, Brooklyn, and Weehawken, New Jersey, to spread the cause and organize other marginalized workers. Their home at 611 Gregory Avenue in Weehawken was often a center of radical activism through the 1930s, with large gatherings on Sundays. They had ten children, though only eight survived to adulthood (Violet, Sensitiva, Sirio, Iris, Flora, Pedro, Helios and Zephyr); they lost their ten-year-old son in an explosion that they believed was an attempt on Esteve's life.\n\n"}

Fry, commonly known simply by his surname Fry, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the animated sitcom \"Futurama\". He is voiced by Billy West using a version of his own voice as he sounded when he was 25. He is a slacker delivery boy from the 20th century who becomes cryogenically frozen and reawakens in the 30th century to become a delivery boy there with an intergalactic delivery company run by his 30th great nephew, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth. He is the best friend and roommate of Bender and the boyfriend and later husband of Turanga Leela. He is the father of Yancy Fry, Sr. (due to an affair with his soon-to-be paternal grandmother) and in comic only, Elena Fry as well as the stepfather of Kif's Offspring (due to Kif's pregnancy and Leela's accident motherhood).\n\nBorn in the 20th century in New York City, Fry is depicted as an unintelligent manchild in his 20s. The episode \"The Luck of the Fryrish\" seems to imply he was 25 at the time of his freezing. He is a pizza delivery boy who, during the last few seconds of the year 1999, falls into a cryogenic tank while delivering a pizza to Applied Cryogenics. He remains frozen until the last day of the year 2999. He then meets the one-eyed cryogenics counselor and his-soon-to-be wife, Leela and the cigar-smoking, alcoholic, kleptomaniac robot Bender. Together, they are employed by Fry's distant nephew, the senile and demented old scientist Professor Farnsworth, as the crew of his delivery company Planet Express.\n\nFry's parents are Yancy Fry, Sr., a strict Republican who believes in conspiracy theories, and Sherri Fry (née Gleisner), an inattentive chain smoker and avid New York Mets fan. It is later revealed that Fry's family on his father's side is from New Mexico. In the past Fry had an older brother named Yancy; a dog named Seymour; and a girlfriend named Michelle (who dumped him in the first episode, \"Space Pilot 3000\", just before he was frozen). Fry had a lifelong sibling rivalry with his older brother Yancy, due to Fry's perception that Yancy steals everything from him and vice versa. After dropping out of Coney Island Community College, he then got a job as a delivery boy at Panucci's Pizza. Depictions of Fry's family in early episodes showed them as extremely dysfunctional, with a neglectful mother and borderline-abusive father. Later seasons, however, depicted them as much closer and, while still dysfunctional, more loving and attentive, with Fry's father treating him harshly to ensure he grew up tough. He survived a heart attack.\n\nFry is characterized as simple, gullible, sweet, yet immature. Fry regards Bender as his closest friend. He also has strong feelings for Leela, although he lacks the intelligence required for articulating his emotions; thus, for most of the series his love remains (sometimes coldly) unrequited, though not entirely without hope. She does occasionally return his interest throughout the series, and in the movie \"\" she admits to loving him back. At the end of that film, they are seen sharing a kiss as they enter a wormhole, and subsequently begin dating. Despite his low intelligence, Fry is very kind-hearted, as he often goes out of his way to help his friends, even if he is sometimes oblivious to their problems. He tolerates all of his friends' quirks and is notable as the only staff member who accepts the ship's doctor, Zoidberg. Although at times lacking in self-awareness, Fry always tries to do the right thing and fix his mistakes. Fry has shown remarkable skill playing video games, (even mastering the 31st-century's version on the Internet), and in \"Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV\" is seen successfully playing a game despite not looking at the screen. This skill carries over to using Planet Express Ship's laser gun. Fry has also exhibited remarkable bravery and self-sacrifice on occasion and has even displayed flashes of stagnant intelligence. Also, despite his laziness and clumsiness, Fry has proved to be a competent fighter in \"Law and Oracle\" and \"Fun on a Bun\", the latter episode showing that Fry is skilled enough to hold his own against Leela in direct physical combat. He has also survived a heart attack intentionally caused by his best friend Bender.\n\nIn the episode \"The Why of Fry\", Leela's seemingly oblivious pet Nibbler reveals himself as the reason for Fry's freezing; because Fry lacks the Delta brainwave. Due to a time-travel incident in \"Roswell That Ends Well\", he is his own grandfather. He can withstand the intellect-draining onslaught of the evil Brainspawn and is immune to the Dark One's mind-reading in \"\" as well as the mind-controlling power of the Hypnotoad. Nibbler's race, the Nibblonians, dub him \"The Mighty One\". Through prediction (on the eve of 1999, as the Nibblonians lack the ability to travel through time), they guessed that Fry would be the one to save the world from the evil Brainspawn. Because his natural lifespan would not extend to the right millennium, however, Nibbler is sent to make the aforementioned delivery call to push an unsuspecting Fry into the cryogenic tube, to re-emerge December 31, 2999.\n\nIn several episodes, he feels nostalgic for the 20th century, and tries to convince his coworkers how good it was back then.\n\nLeela is Fry's main love interest, and his love for her provides a major plot line throughout the series. Fry first begins to show a serious interest in her from the second season onwards, although she constantly turns him down for other dates due to his immaturity, though she says that she loves his boyish charm. Leela initially sees Fry as a friend and nothing more, but deeper affection for him appears occasionally, such as on the numerous occasions when he risks his life for hers (\"Love and Rocket\", \"The Sting\", \"Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences\").\n\nFry's feelings for Leela are openly displayed throughout the series. In \"The Sting\", Fry throws himself in front of a baby Queen Bee to protect Leela, resulting in the bee's stinger completely penetrating his torso. In \"Love and Rocket\", upon noticing that Leela's oxygen tank was running on 'critical', he attaches her oxygen tube to his tank, giving her his oxygen and almost asphyxiating himself. In \"Parasites Lost\", Fry becomes infected with symbiotic \"parasites\" which enhance his muscles and intelligence, allowing him to attract Leela's romantic attention. However, fearing that Leela was attracted to him only for his worms, he rids himself of them in a failed bid to begin a genuine relationship. In \"Time Keeps on Slippin'\", Fry moves the stars to write a love note to Leela, but the message is blown up before she can read it. In the final episode of the initial run, \"The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings\", Fry trades hands with the Robot Devil in order to compose an opera about Leela in which they fall in love. When Fry returns the Robot Devil's hands to prevent him from forcing Leela to marry him, the opera deteriorates, causing the audience to leave. Fry sadly walks off the stage. Leela is the only one who remains behind, asking Fry not to stop because she wants to hear how it ends. He picks up his holophonor and composes a crude ending in which the stage-Fry and stage-Leela share a single kiss.\n\nIn the film \"\" Leela falls in love with a seemingly perfect man, Lars, and they soon become engaged. However, Lars leaves Leela on her wedding day explaining later that as a time paradox he is doomed, and that he wouldn't marry her only to have her lose him soon after. Through this he then reveals that he is in fact the time paradox of Fry, who had undergone physical changes due to an explosion and become more mature through 12 years of age and experience.\n\nAt the end of the film \"\", Leela openly admits to loving Fry, and they commence an openly romantic relationship from the episode \"Rebirth\" onwards. In \"The Prisoner of Benda\" they have \"sex\", albeit in differing bodies. The on-again, off again nature of their relationship causes Leela to leave Planet Express and Fry in \"Overclockwise\", however by the end of the episode, Leela returns to Planet Express and seemingly reunites with Fry. Bender reveals to both Fry and Leela their \"ultimate fate\" that he learned while he was overclocked. The audience is never shown the contents, but through their facial expressions it is clear that while the journey for them may be bumpy, Fry and Leela will ultimately end up happy.\n\nIn later episodes, such as \"The Butterjunk Effect\" and \"Fun on a Bun\", Fry and Leela are shown to be in a relationship, though the events of the series precipitate frequent arguments and breakups. These issues are usually resolved within the episode, leaving Fry and Leela still together at the end.\n\nDuring the series finale \"Meanwhile\", Fry decides that it is time for him to propose to Leela. Wanting the moment of his proposal to last longer, he steals Professor Farnsworth's time machine remote that turns back time every 10 seconds. When Leela is late, he thinks she has rejected him and attempts suicide by jumping off the building; he sees her arriving just in time, however, and presses the reset button over and over again to keep from hitting the ground. He accidentally breaks the remote and freezes time, leaving himself and Leela as the only unfrozen beings in the universe. Leela accepts Fry's proposal, and they have a long, happy marriage. The Professor shows up during one of their anniversaries and repairs the time machine, but informs them it will reset their lives, leaving them with no memory of the lifetime they spent together. Fry asks Leela if she wants to go around again with him, and she replies that she does. But they are apparently still married in the video game \"\".\n\nMichelle (voiced by Kath Soucie in the first appearance, Sarah Silverman in the second appearance) is Fry's on-and-off girlfriend from the 20th century. Shortly before Fry is frozen, she dumps him for a man named Constantine (called Charles in \"The Cryonic Woman\"), whom she later marries. They eventually split up, and she decides to freeze herself to try again in the distant future. She wakes up in 3002, meets Fry again, and restarts her relationship with him. However, she fails to fit into the 31st-century life to which Fry has become so accustomed, and so asks him to freeze himself with her for another thousand years. This plan fails, as does the rekindled relationship, so Fry leaves her. She later is shown in a limousine with the recently unfrozen Pauly Shore. In the episode \"Proposition Infinity\", she is again shown with Pauly Shore, and the implication is that they are now married.\n\nDuring a trip on the luxury starliner \"Titanic\", Amy Wong passes Fry off as her boyfriend to avoid being set up by her parents with an unattractive potential husband. Unfortunately, Leela was also passing Fry off as her fake fiancé to ward off the attentions of Zapp Brannigan. Potential embarrassment is averted by catastrophic damage to the ship, and Amy wins the battle of the bogus boyfriends.\n\nIn \"Put Your Head on My Shoulders\", Fry and Amy are trapped together in a desert on Mercury and realize they have a lot in common. While being towed to the nearest gas station to refuel, they have sex in the car. They continue the relationship back home, but Fry intends to end it the day before Valentine's Day because he feels that they are spending too much time together. An accident ends with Fry's head being temporarily attached to Amy's body, causing much tension due to Fry's decision to break up and Amy's subsequent date, forcing Leela to step in and distract Amy's date to save Fry from an awkward situation. Despite their break-up, they remain good friends.\n\nAlthough Billy West stated in an interview that the name \"Philip\" was given to Fry by Matt Groening as a homage to the late Phil Hartman, for whom the role of Zapp Brannigan was created, Groening said during the 2013 Futurama panel at the San Diego Comic-Con that Fry was in fact named after Groening's father, Homer Phillip Groening, who was also the namesake for Homer Simpson.\n\nAccording to Groening, Fry's character developed over time while still keeping his qualities as a loser and the characteristics which writers hoped would make him appeal to the target young male audience. Fry's character is essentially a bungling, stubborn slob with a heart of gold who cannot get ahead in the world, but still has a slight glimmer of hope. Fry's trademark outfit - a red windbreaker jacket, white t-shirt and blue jeans - is based on James Dean's outfit from \"Rebel Without a Cause\".\n\nFry is voiced by Billy West, who also voices Doctor Zoidberg, Hubert J. Farnsworth and various other characters in the series. Although West auditioned for the part, it was originally given to Charlie Schlatter; however, after a casting change, West was offered the job. The voice West uses for Fry has been described as that of a \"generic Saturday-morning good guy\". West admits that he intentionally made Fry's sound similar to his own, claiming that keeping the \"cartoony\" aspects out of it would make it harder for someone else to imitate the same voice. He notes that the voice is higher than his own and that he tried to duplicate the voice he had at age 25, which he describes as \"this whiny, complaining voice — this plain vanilla voice\". West also voices Lars Fillmore in \"\", who is a time travel duplicate of Fry with an injured larynx, and therefore, a slightly altered voice. The producers initially considered having a different voice actor do Lars' voice in order to keep viewers from guessing his true identity, but ultimately decided it would not make sense if anyone besides West did the voice.\n\n"}

Donald Wicht had been suffocated and Rhonda Wicht had been raped, beaten and strangled. The police suspected Coley was the murderer because he had been Rhonda Wicht's boyfriend for two years and the couple had recently broken up.\n\nColey, a restaurant night manager who had previously served in the US navy including three deployments to Vietnam in an aircraft carrier, was arrested the same day as the murders and charged with the double murder. The first trial resulted in a hung jury. The second trial in 1980 led to his conviction and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nAfter Coley lost his final appeal to his conviction, the judge ordered all evidence to be destroyed.\n\nMichael Bender, a serving Detective with Simi Valley Police Department, started to re-investigate Coley's case in 1989 and discovered there were problems with the case. Until his death, Coley's father, a retired police officer, had been trying to free his son. Simi Valley Police Chief Dave Livinstone PhD, requested a new investigation by Cold Case Detecitve Dan Swanson. Det. Swanson located the missing evidence and new DNA tests not available at the original trial showed there was no trace of Coley's DNA on the evidence material, but there was the DNA of other people. Investigators also disproved the testimony of a witness from the original trial who claimed to have seen Coley at the scene of the crime. In a report to the local police, three former and current police officers testified that the detective at the time of Coley's trial had “mishandled the investigation or framed Mr. Coley.” The local prosecutor felt the original detectives decided Coley was guilty too quickly (that they were victims of \"tunnel vision\").\n\nCalifornia governor Jerry Brown pardoned Coley on 22 November 2017 because the evidence showed he was innocent of the murders. In February 2018, the California Victims Compensation Board awarded Coley almost $2 million in compensation for his wrongful imprisonment for almost 40 years.\n"}

Butten died during the voyage of the \"Mayflower\" while traveling with Fuller, who had been appointed doctor for the group. At that time, children and young men were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Butten was sick the entire voyage and died at sea when near the coast of New England.\n\nThe \"Mayflower\" departed Plymouth, England, on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.\n\nOn November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was Cape Cod. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day. There were forty-one of the adult males, including the servants, who signed the Compact.\n\nWilliam Butten's parentage is a mystery. His name is of an ancient French heritage introduced in England after Norman Conquest. He seemed to be a long-time member of the Leiden congregation and therefore was probably one of the Separatists. Upon the death of his father, his mother being too poor to support him, he became an indentured servant. One theory is that he may have been the son of Robert Butten and baptized Austerfield 12 February 1598. Another version is that his family were members of the Separatist Community in Worksop, Nottinghamshire and was baptized March 13, 1605 there, near William Bradford and other Separatists.\n\nButten is memorialized on the \"Mayflower\" Passengers Who Died at Sea Memorial.\n\n"}
