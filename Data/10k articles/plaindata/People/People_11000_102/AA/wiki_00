A graduate of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, her work has been widely exhibited and is held by a number of museums. Crowe dedicated much of her career to teaching and training the next generation of Eastern Cherokee artists.\n\nCrowe was born on July 16, 1928, in the Qualla Boundary, North Carolina. By the age of four, she had decided to become an artist. Of her childhood, Amanda said: \"Every spare minute was spent in carving or studying anything available concerning art ... \" At the age of eight, she was already selling her carvings.\n\nBoth of Crowe's parents died when she was very young. By the time she reached high school, her foster mother arranged for her to stay in Chicago, where she graduated from Hyde Park High School and attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). She earned the John Quincy Adams fellowship for foreign study in 1952, and she chose to study sculpture with Jose De Creeft at the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Crowe also earned her Master of Fine Arts degree from SAIC that year.\n\nIn 1953, the Cherokee Historical Association invited Crowe back to North Carolina to teach studio art at Cherokee High School, where her uncle Goingback Chiltoskey was already teaching. She set up a studio in the Paint Town community and taught wood carving for almost four decades to over 2,000 students.\n\nHer sculptures were often animal figures, and she was particularly known for her expressive bears. Her work is streamlined, highly stylized, and smoothly carved. She also worked with stone and clay, but wood was her favorite medium, and she carved with local woods such as wild cherry, buckeye, and black walnut.\n\nHer art is sometimes compared to the work of Willard Stone. Art scholar Esther Bockhoff writes that Crowe was \"undoubtedly one of the primary influences on the resurgence of Cherokee carving.\"\n\nPublic collections that own her work include the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the United States Department of the Interior, and the National Museum of the American Indian. She has exhibited her work in such museums as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Atlanta Art Museum, the Denver Art Museum, the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, the Asheville Art Museum, and venues in Germany and the United Kingdom.

Although a poor woman, she found followers and a patron prepared to fund the publishing of her religious writing. She was separated from her husband; their unstable relationship being the cause of her prophecies.\n\nMost of what is known about Anne Wentworth has been derived from her four extant texts, which are autobiographical in nature. They do not give specific details of her early life but do suggest that she was born into a Lincolnshire family between 1629 and 1630. \n\nIn 1652/1653, she married William Wentworth of London (Gill 115). In the late 1660s, Wentworth gave birth to a daughter (Taft). Several years later, around 1670, Wentworth experienced a restoration of faith in God after eighteen years in her unhappy marriage. After this \"visitation\" from God, Wentworth spent almost seven years writing and perfecting her craft, before publishing her first work, a pamphlet entitled, \"A True Account of Anne Wentworth's Being Cruelly, Unjustly, and Unchristianly Dealt with by Some of Those People Called Anabaptists\" (1676), more commonly referred to as \"A True Account of Anne Wentworth\" (Taft). In this piece, Wentworth reflects on the patriarchal domination of her husband, understanding it as punishment from God (Taft).\n\nDespite the seven years it took for Wentworth to finally publish her first work, her life as a prophetess did not go unrecognized (Taft). Her husband and fellow Anabaptist comrades (today referred to as Baptists) began to persecute Wentworth during this time as she expressed her prophetic voice. In 1675, it is unclear whether Wentworth was excommunicated from their church after writing critiques on it (Gill 115) or whether she left it of her own free will (Taft); however, it is clear that the abuse from her husband and fellow Anabaptists intensified after she no longer belonged to their local church.\n\nIn 1677, Wentworth published \"A Vindication of Anne Wentworth\", another autobiographical work like \"A True Account\" that attempts to \"justify her prophetic voice as genuine, narrate the persecution inflicted upon her because of her prophetic activity, and predict the imminent coming of the Apocalypse\" (Taft). At this time, she also sent letters to King Charles II and the Lord Mayor of London relating the coming Apocalypse \"before New Year's Day, 1678\" (Taft). This enraged her husband who enlisted the help of three of his cousins to remove Wentworth from her home in the summer of 1677 (Taft). And despite the decline in her popularity after her prophecy did not come true, Anne continued to write \"England's Spiritual Pill\", which \"may have appeared in 1678, but its publication date is uncertain\" (Taft) and \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ\", which was meant to record \"the actual words Christ ... spoke to her\" that incited her prophetic voice. This text also acts as proof that someone still supported her after 1678 due to the line, \"Friend in love to Souls\" that is recognized on the work's title page, recognizing the individual who financed its publication in 1679. That same year, Wentworth returned to her home.\n\nAfter \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ\" however, no other texts have been uncovered written by Wentworth. Her voice fell silent and there is some speculation that she is the Anne Wentworth who went on to live \"in St John's Court and was buried on 22 May 1693 at St James's Church, Clerkenwell\" (Gill 115), but there is no confirmation on this.\n\nDuring the time that Wentworth wrote, the fact that her pieces were published and she was recognized as a public figure of her community is astonishing. Her works not only spoke out against her husband but they were also religiously and politically charged—a dangerous combination for a woman of the time. Due to her departure from what was traditionally accepted behavior for women of her time, Wentworth's life was tainted by chaos and persecution. Despite this however, she persevered and was able to write and publish the work that was significant to her—a truly remarkable feat for a woman of her time.\n\n\"A True Account of Anne Wentworth\" was published in 1676. It was the first published work by Wentworth. Its full title is \"A True Account of Anne Wentworths Being cruelly, unjustly, and unchristianly dealt with by some of those people called Anabaptists\". It is a seventeen-page pamphlet that describes an account of her eighteen years spent with her suppressive husband. It is a fairly vague description of the actual abuses her husband acted against her but it does claim she came very close to death, caused by her husband's treatment, only to be saved by God. She also describes the threats and suppressing behavior of the fellow Anabaptists of her town. In her \"True Account\", Wentworth proclaims God as her one true savior and Christianity as the one true religion (Wentworth, Freeman). She describes leaving her heavenly husband for God as her Spiritual Bridegroom (Gillespie).\n\n\"A Vindication of Anne Wentworth\" published in 1677 was Wentworth's second work. In this pamphlet Wentworth goes into greater detail about her abuse by her husband and the Anabaptists. She also prophesizes the upcoming apocalypse God has promised. In \"A Vindication\" Wentworth states that she is not seeking revenge and hopes her husband will be saved himself. She ensures that she was an unwilling party in her writings and only by the fear of God's imminent power did she expose her husband's wrongdoings. Wentworth concludes with a poem about her mistreatment, her innocence, and the forthcoming apocalypse that will punish London for her sins (Wentworth, Freeman).\n\nPublished in 1679, this is the last of Anne Wentworth's known works. The complete title to this piece is \"ENGLANDS SPIRITUAL PILL Which will Purge, Cure, or Kill; DECLARING The Great and Wonderfull Things WHICH The Almighty and most High God JESUS CHRIST King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Hath Revealed unto ANNE WENTWORTH CONCERNING A Through-Reformation of Church-worship, from all Hypocritical and Idolatrous Formalities, the downfall of Babylon, and the finishing of her Testimony\".\n\nSimilar to \"A Revelation of Jesus Christ\", this piece too, deals with the encounters between Jesus Christ and Anne Wentworth. She says that because of the success of her first book, she has a continued duty to enlighten people before the wrath of God is upon them.\n\n\"Just as he spake it in Verses at several times, and sometimes in Prose, unto his Faithful Servant, Anne Wentworth, who suffereth for his Name\" (Freeman 693).\n\n\"A Revelation of Jesus Christ\", published in 1679, is the text in which Wentworth records the conversations she had with Christ from 1677 to 1679. Within the text she advises friends to awake and speak the truth of God, but it appears they seem doubtful of her prophecies, prompting Wentworth to write \"For when the Lord of Life sends in love to warn you,/ Ye slight his Word, because his Voice ye never knew\" (Freeman 701). This launches the discussion between Wentworth and Christ about how the ignorant people around her will suffer when the end of the world arrives.\n\nHarrison. Vol. 58.

He was a friend of Richard Wagner and active in the Revolutions of 1848.\n\nRöckel was born in Graz. His father, Joseph August Röckel, was a tenor, choir director and theatre entrepreneur who sang the role of Florestan at the premiere of the second version of Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Fidelio\" in 1806. With his father, he experienced theatrical life in Vienna, Paris and London. He acted in Paris as assistant to Gioacchino Rossini at the Théâtre des Italiens, and was on a later visit to Paris an eyewitness to the Paris \"July revolution\" of 1830.\n\nAfter he completed his musical training with his uncle, Johann Nepomuk Hummel (who was married to his father's sister Elisabeth Röckel), he was music director in Bamberg starting in 1838. He lived in Vienna from 1839. For several years after 1840 he was conductor at the Weimar Court Theatre, where he composed his opera \"Farinelli\". In 1843 he came to Dresden, where he was at the Court Theatre, where Richard Wagner was music director. He was assistant conductor (\"2. Musikdirektor\") to Wagner for five years until 1848. Influenced by the music of Wagner, he renounced a performance of his own opera, which he had sent to Dresden. Wagner became a close friend, especially during the time of 1849 Dresden uprising, and the two would go on long walks together.\n\nRöckel was an ardent Republican; he became friends with the likes of Michael Bakunin and was the editor of the revolutionary journal in Dresden, \"Volksblätter\", to which Wagner also contributed. After the failure of the uprising, Röckel was captured along with Bakunin and sentenced to death, while Wagner escaped to Zurich. The death sentences were later commuted to prison terms. Whilst Bakunin was handed over to Russia, Röckel had to serve a thirteen-year sentence in solitary confinement at the Königstein Fortress and at Waldheim, and was only released in January 1862, the last of the May insurgents to be freed.\n\nWhile in custody, he received many letters from Wagner, in which Wagner made insightful statements on his opera cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", which give valuable background to the revolutionary and socially critical nature of Wagner's magnum opus. During detention Rockel wrote his book \"The Saxon Revolt and the Waldheim Penitentiary\". In 1862 in Biebrich he once more met Wagner, who at that time was living there, writing \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\". However Wagner later quarrelled with Röckel when, in the late 1860s, he believed that the latter had been gossiping about his relationship with Cosima von Bülow.\n\nRöckel lived in Frankfurt from 1863. In 1866 he moved to Munich, and later in Vienna. In 1871 he suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. He finally died after a long illness at the house of his son in Budapest.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6041355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6041355", "title": "Bankei Yōtaku", "text": "Bankei Yōtaku\n\nBankei Yōtaku was born in 1622, in Harima Province to a samurai turned medicine man named Suga Dosetsu. His boyhood name was Muchi. Bankei's mother bore the last name of Noguchi, and little more is known of her, other than that the society of the time extolled her as 'Maya who begot three Buddhas,' - Maya being the mother of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. Bankei had four brothers and four sisters. His eldest brother, Masayasu, was a skilled physician and his second eldest brother was a practitioner of the Pure Land school of Buddhism. Hence Bankei's mother was likened to Maya, Masayasu to Yakushi - the Buddha of healing, his second eldest brother to the Buddha Amida, and Bankei himself to Shakyamuni Buddha. Bankei was a rebellious and mischievous child, though he showed remarkable intelligence. When Bankei was 11, his father died, and in the following year he entered school.\n\nHere he was taught many of the Confucian texts. At this time, Bankei was young and full of questions and the Confucian classics he was being taught confused him greatly. One day, the teacher read the first line from 'Great Learning': \"The way of great learning lies in clarifying bright virtue.\" Bankei entered a heated exchange with his teacher imploring them for the meaning of this. Bankei felt no satisfactory answers were given.\n\nThis gap in Bankei's understanding gave birth to many doubts and questions, and so he seized most every chance to question others on their knowledge. He would implore Confucian and Buddhist scholars and attend various religious gatherings in search of answers. All of this, however, proved futile for him. He became so distraught in his need to find answers that school was no longer a priority for him, and in 1633 he was kicked out of his family home. A friend of his family, Yūkan Nakahori, allowed Bankei to stay in a small hut nearby. Being a bit eccentric, Bankei etched into a slat of wood \"Practice hermitage\" and placed it outside of his little hut.\n\nIt is likely that Bankei began practicing Shin Buddhism during this time. It is known that when Bankei was 15 he trained at a Shingon temple, where he apparently gained some footing in sutra study. However, Bankei was not satisfied with the Shingon approach and left that following year. At 16 he walked from Hamada to Ako to see a Rinzai Zen priest named Umpo Zenjo at Zuiō-ji. Bankei wasted no time with Umpo and implored him on the meaning of bright virtue, to which Umpo advised the only path toward such understanding could be had through the practice of zazen. Bankei was intrigued by this advice and ordained as a monk at Zuiō-ji under Umpo. It was here he received his Buddhist name Yōtaku (meaning 'Long Polishing of the Mind Gem').\n\nWhen Bankei turned 19 he left Zuiō-ji shortly after and travelled through Kyoto, Osaka and Kyūshū in search for an answer to his question. During his travels he would stay over at temples or sleep in the open wilderness, scrounging by as a beggar. In 1645, at age 24, Bankei returned to Zuiō-ji no wiser than the day he left. At this time Umpo informs him that the answer which he seeks can only be found within, not through an intermediary. Bankei left shortly after his return and built a small hut nearby and lived as a hermit. He would sit for hours practicing zazen. He had given up bodily comfort and had no other goal during this time aside from coming to a complete understanding of things. He practiced this way for many years, but eventually the bodily neglect caused him to contract tuberculosis. He sought the care of a doctor who gave the prognosis of death.\n\nIt was during this near-death experience that Bankei realized the Unborn, later stating of the experience:\nFollowing this breakthrough his doubt and questioning ceased while his physical condition turned for the better. Once strong enough to travel again, he returned to Umpo to relay his experience to him. Umpo confirmed his enlightenment. He sent Bankei off to have his understanding further evidenced by Gudō Toshoku, another Rinzai master.\n\nAt the age of 26 Bankei went to Gifu Prefecture to Daisen-ji where Gudo was abbot. However, when Bankei arrived Gudo was attending to another temple of his in the countryside. So Bankei visited the temples of other Zen teachers in the area, none of which had priests with the proper understanding themselves to confirm his understanding. After a year living in the countryside near Daisen-ji, Bankei travelled back to Umpo once again. In 1651, Bankei heard that a Ch'an master had arrived in Nagasaki by the name of Dosha Chogen. Umpo advised he go see the Ch'an master, and Bankei set off for Nagasaki hoping to finally have his enlightenment confirmed.\n\nBankei found Dosha Chogen at Sōfuku-ji, a Chinese style temple. Dosha confirmed Bankei's understanding on their first meeting, but also informed Bankei that his understanding was incomplete. Bankei was offended by this initially and refused to accept it. Yet he stayed at the temple for a bit to observe Dosha's ways, eventually realizing what Dosha had insisted was true. So Bankei stayed on at Sōfuku-ji practicing under Dosha.\n\nWhile Bankei lived among the other monks at the temple, he refused to chant the sutras with them in Chinese. In 1652, while meditating with the congregation, Bankei experienced final awakening. Dosha confirmed this the next day, stating Bankei had finally settled the Great Matter. Bankei then refused a senior position in the monastery, preferring his unassuming existence instead working in the kitchen. The following year Bankei returned to Harima for a short while, and then left for Yoshino in the Nara Prefecture to live again as a hermit. In the mountains of Yoshino, Bankei authored some Buddhist chants pertaining to the Unborn while living there in silent retreat.\n\nThe Unborn (Japanese \"fushō\") is a Sanskrit term, \"anutpāda\":\n\nTaken together \"anutpāda\" means \"having no origin\", \"not coming into existence\", \"not taking effect\", \"non-production\".\n\nThe Buddhist tradition uses the term \"anutpāda\" for the absence of an origin or sunyata. The term is also used in the Lankavatara Sutra, where it is equated with sunyata. According to D.T Suzuki, \"anutpada\" is not the opposite of \"utpada\", but transcends opposites. It is the seeing into the true nature of existence, the seeing that \"all objects are without self-substance\".\n\nThe full phrase is \"fushō fumetsu\", \"unborn and undying\", or \"no creation and no annihilation\", but in later years Bankei only used the term \"unborn\", since Bankei thought it logically impossible to say that something which has not been created is being destroyed, rendering the term \"undying\" redundant. However, it certainly is not logically impossible for something which has always existed to cease existing, hence the necessity of employing both terms.\n\nAlthough the Unborn is the natural state of man, \"self-criticism\" rather than zazen or koans are needed to liberate the self from illusion and dualistic thoughts and fixations (\"nen\"). According to Bankei, illusion arises through \"selfish desire\", and \"nen\" are \"images of things seen and heard\". By detaching from those illusions and fixations, \n\n"}

{"id": "289661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=289661", "title": "Cloud Strife", "text": "Cloud Strife\n\nCloud was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, a character artist for the \"Final Fantasy\" series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. Yoshinori Kitase, director of \"VII\", and Kazushige Nojima, one of the game's event planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After \"VII\", Nomura assumed greater responsibility over Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style. Cloud's appearance is marked by spiky blond hair, striking blue eyes, dark clothing and his ; the sword previously belonged to his friend, Zack Fair. He stands 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as \"iconic\", Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games and as one of its first unreliable narrators. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by \"Famitsu\", \"Guinness\", and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as trope for other characters, most notably Lightning from \"Final Fantasy XIII\". He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as action figures and jewelry.\n\nCloud's character was made to contrast the cast of the previous game, \"Final Fantasy VI\", which had no main character. As result Yoshinori Kitase commented Cloud was designed to be the game's protagonist during early development of the game. Conceptualized as one of only three playable characters in early planning stages for the game, Cloud was one of the first two characters designed for \"Final Fantasy VII\" by Tetsuya Nomura. Nomura worked to strike an orthodox balance of varied designs for the game. Because he only started receiving character profiles prior to composing their appearances during later game productions, Nomura thought of the characters' stories first before tackling their designs. Nomura's first draft of Cloud featured slicked-back, black hair. The depiction served both as a contrast to the long silver hair of the game's chief antagonist, Sephiroth, and to minimize the model's polygon count. However, to make Cloud stand out more and emphasize his role as the game's lead protagonist, Nomura altered Cloud's design to give him spiky, bright blond hair. and in particular influenced the look of their swords. Early renditions of Cloud's weapon, the Buster Sword, depicted a smaller blade. Its size grew over the course of several revisions, and Nomura called it \"the Giant Kitchen Knife\", envisioning it as unrefined steel. Nomura stated the Buster Sword was originally going to look like a Western sword while body was more built. The sword at one point featured a small chain connected to the pommel, while magnets would secure the blade to Cloud's back. More deeply involved with Cloud's creation than with other characters' from previous \"Final Fantasy\" projects, Nomura also provided supervision over Cloud's personality traits.\n\nYoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima developed Cloud's backstory and his relationship to Sephiroth. The idea for Cloud's false persona arose after Nojima saw event planner Motomu Toriyama's standing animation depicting \"Cloud showing off\", which impressed him and inspired the basis for the scenario. Nojima created the character of Zack so as to expand upon the mysteries in Cloud's backstory. Kitase remained unaware of the addition's significance until playtesting, as Nojima left the unfolding of events concerning Cloud's identity unwritten. In emphasizing Cloud's individuality, the staff made repeated use of elements that they believed made the character interesting, such as Cloud's phrase \"not interested\" and Toriyama's standing animation. Kitase felt Cloud's character was fresh in reviewing Nojima's scenario, observing that he possessed an atypical personality for a hero by being neither single-minded nor righteous. The love triangle between Cloud, Tifa and Aerith was also viewed as novel for the series, and Nojima likened Cloud's relationship to Tifa as one of childhood friends since nursery school, whereas Aerith was akin to a transfer student arriving mid-term.\n\nIn early drafts, Cloud would act as an alter ego for Sephiroth, influenced to believe he was a creation of Sephiroth's will. As in the finished game, Cloud would later realize that he is the real Cloud, and that the reason Sephiroth could control his mind and body was because of his weakened will and Shinra's experiments. Additionally, Cloud would have scarred Tifa prior to the game's events, although the reasons for as to why were unknown. Early materials listed Cloud's job as and . Masato Kato, one of the event planners, proposed a scene involving Cloud walking out of the Highwind's Chocobo stable followed by Tifa the morning before the final battle. Kitase rejected it as too extreme, but maintained a scene written by Kato depicting the night before, in which a risqué line is spoken by Tifa followed by a fade to black. In an interview, Nojima stated that none of the staff thought it would become an important issue at the time.\n\nNojima has explained that the relationship between the player and the main character in a \"Final Fantasy\" title is a dynamic he has always been concerned about. With \"VII\", Cloud's subdued nature led him to write scenes with the character in such a way that the players would be placed in the position of deciding for themselves what the character was thinking. Cloud's foggy memories served both to help players \"become\" the character, and to introduce them to a world which other inhabitants would otherwise share common knowledge of. Nomura believes that the reason Cloud has become so popular with audiences is due to the impact his personality made in Nojima's scenario.\n\nIn retrospective, the Square Enix staff commented that Cloud is a \"dorky\" person in contrast to being a serious character. As a result, the former will be more focused on in the remake of \"Final Fantasy VII\". His design was briefly altered but Square Enix stated it will be close to the original design Nomura created for him. In an early event from \"Final Fantasy VII\", Cloud crossdresses in order to find Tifa. Nomura noted fans found this event was popular within the fans and reassured the remake will keep this part. On the other hand, the character designer stated that their final design was not decided yet.\n\nNomura redesigned Cloud for his appearance in \"Kingdom Hearts\". He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and the blade of his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained that he wanted to give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of video game \"The Bouncer\", Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in \"Final Fantasy VII\".\n\nFor \"Advent Children\", Nomura agreed to direct the project largely because of his attachment to the character of Cloud. Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in \"Final Fantasy VII\" than in \"Advent Children\", he did not believe that such an \"'upbeat' image of him is what stuck in the minds of the fans\", and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind \"consistent with the fans' view of him.\" Nomura describes Cloud's life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing. Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself. In contrast to other heroes, who, in Nomura's view, typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks, Nomura believed Cloud's weakness to be humanizing. Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship. Cloud, by taking up his sword and fighting, struggles to achieve it. Nojima sought to establish Cloud's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone, but never answering any calls. He originally intended for Aerith's name to be the last of those displayed while the backlog of ignored messages appears as Cloud's cell phone sinks into the water, but Nojima altered the scene because it \"sounded too creepy\". The wolf which Cloud imagines \"represents the deepest part of Cloud's psyche\" and \"appears in response to some burden that Cloud is carrying deep in his heart\", vanishing at the film's end. Nomura cites one of the film's final scenes, in which Cloud smiles, as his favorite, highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud's embarrassment. The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu's score, who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script, commenting on the difficulty players who had finished \"Final Fantasy VII\" would have had imagining Cloud's smile.\n\nNomura sought to make Cloud's design \"distinctly different from the other characters.\" About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which \"looked gross.\" Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of \"clothes designed for action\", the staff began with the idea of a black robe, eventually parring it down to a \"long apron\" shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't \"logically thought out\" and the staff didn't think that they could \"make it work physically\", it was believed to provide \"an interesting accent to the story.\" Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's \"Hardy-Daytona\" motorcycle from \"Final Fantasy VII\". As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.\n\nThemes expanded in the director's cut \"Advent Children Complete\" include Cloud's development with links to other \"Final Fantasy VII\" related media where he appeared. In order to further focus on Cloud's growth, Square decided to give him more scenes when he interacts with children. Additionally, the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was expanded by several minutes, and includes a scene in which Sephiroth impales Cloud on his sword and holds him in the air, mirroring the scene in the game where he performs the same action. The decision to feature Cloud suffering for blood loss in the fight was made in order to make the character's pain feel realistic.\n\nFor \"Advent Children\", Nomura wanted to contrast Cloud and Vincent's voices given their similar personalities. As a sequel to the highly popular \"Final Fantasy VII\", Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than he did when he voiced Cloud for \"Kingdom Hearts\". Sakurai received comments from colleagues revealing their love of the game, some of them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive Sakurai if he did not meet their expectations. During recording, Sakurai was told that \"[n]o matter what kind of odds are stacked against him, Cloud won't be shaken.\" Sakurai says that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside Ayumi Ito, who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling \"deflated\", as the \"exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful\", Sakurai commenting that Cloud—whom he empathized with as his voice actor—has a hard time dealing with straight talk. Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete, with very precise directions being given requiring multiple takes. \n\nAccording to Sakurai, Cloud's silence conveys more about the character than when he speaks. While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud's outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects. A fan of \"VII\", Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental. After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans' response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him. While recording \"Crisis Core\", Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud's scream over Zack's death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending. Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a \"Final Fantasy VII\" fan himself, he is happy to contribute.\n\nIn English adaptations, Cloud is voiced by Steve Burton. Burton was first hired to voice Cloud once a man behind Square saw his work in the 2001 movie \"The Last Castle\". Burton's work as Cloud in \"Advent Children\" served as his first feature length role, an experience he enjoyed. Calling the character a rare opportunity for him as an actor, Burton describes Cloud as having a \"heaviness about him\". Burton says he is surprised when fans recognize him for his work as Cloud, whom he has referred to as \"[one of the] coolest characters there is,\" and he too considers himself lucky for having voiced him. Although in the original \"Final Fantasy VII\" Cloud was a silent character, Burton confirmed he will be voicing him for the remake of the game.\n\nCloud is introduced as a mercenary employed by AVALANCHE, an eco-terrorist group opposed to the Shinra Company. Beginning the game with the placeholder name , Cloud assists AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace, in bombing a Mako reactor, power plants which drain the planet's \"Lifestream\". Cloud claims to be formerly of SOLDIER 1st Class, an elite Shinra fighting unit. Despite appearing detached, Cloud demonstrates moments of camaraderie, Players can choose to interact in a friendlier manner with AVALANCHE's members. When approached by his childhood friend and AVALANCHE member, Tifa Lockhart, Cloud agrees to continue helping AVALANCHE. Cloud encounters Aerith Gainsborough, a resident of Midgar's slums. Agreeing to serve as her bodyguard in exchange for a date, Cloud helps Aerith evade Shinra, who pursue her because she is the sole survivor of a race known as the Cetra. During the course of their travels, a love triangle develops between Cloud, Tifa and Aerith. \n\nFollowing the player's departure from Midgar, Cloud narrates his history with Sephiroth, a legendary member of SOLDIER and the game's primary antagonist, and the events that led to Sephiroth's disappearance five years prior. Joining SOLDIER to emulate Sephiroth, Cloud explains that he would sign up for a \"big mission\" whenever they became available, as the conclusion of Shinra's war with the people of Wutai ended his chances for military fame. Sephiroth started questioning his humanity after accompanying him on a job to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim. Discovering documents concerning Jenova, an extraterrestrial lifeform and Sephiroth's \"mother\", \n\nHowever, numerous clues suggest the unreliability of Cloud's memory. Various visual and audio cues. Cloud will spontaneously remember words or scenes from his past, sometimes collapsing to the ground while cradling his head. and she feigns ignorance of who Zack is. As Sephiroth starts manipulating his mind Sephiroth takes advantage of it, telling him that his past is merely a fiction and that Shinra created Cloud in an attempt to clone Sephiroth. Cloud learns he cannot remember things like how or when he joined SOLDIER. Cloud, resigning himself as a \"failed experiment\", goes missing. The party later discovers a comatose Cloud suffering from Mako poisoning. It is revealed that Cloud never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra's army. During the mission to Nibelheim, Cloud served under Sephiroth and Zack, hiding his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth's defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, Cloud managed to nearly killed him in an ambush. Both he and Zack are then imprisoned by Shinra's lead scientist, Hojo, for experimentation. Zack later escapes with Cloud, bringing him to the outskirts of Midgar before Shinra soldiers gun Zack down. Due to exposure to Mako radiation and the injection of Jenova's cells, creating a false personality. After piecing back together his identity, Cloud resumes his role as leader. At the game's conclusion, Sephiroth reappears in Cloud's mind a final time, but he is defeated in a one-on-one fight.\n\nCloud appears in a minor role in the cellphone game \"\", a prequel set six years before \"Final Fantasy VII\". The player, a member of the Shinra covert operatives group, the Turks, encounters Cloud during his time as a Shinra infantryman working to join SOLDIER. The game portrays Cloud's natural talent for swordsmanship, and recounts his role during Nibelheim's destruction.\n\nIn the computer-animated film \"\", set two years following the conclusion of \"Final Fantasy VII\", Cloud lives with Tifa in the city of Edge, along with Marlene, Barret's adopted daughter, and Denzel, an orphan afflicted with a rampant and deadly disease called Geostigma. Having given up his life as a mercenary, Cloud works as a courier for the \"Strife Delivery Service\" that Tifa set up in her new bar. Confronted by Tifa following the disappearance of Denzel and Marlene, it is revealed that he also suffers from the effects of Geostigma, and he responds that he is unfit to protect his friends and new family. However, when urged by Tifa to let go of the past, Cloud sets out for the Forgotten City in search of the children. There, Cloud confronts Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo, genetic remnants of Sephiroth left behind before he diffused into the Lifestream completely. Cloud's battle with Kadaj later takes them back to Aerith's church, where Cloud recovers from his Geostigma with Aerith's help. Kadaj, merging with the remains of Jenova, resurrects Sephiroth. Cloud, having overcome his doubts, defeats Sephiroth once more, leaving a dying Kadaj in his place. At the film's conclusion, Cloud, seeing Aerith and Zack, assures the two that he will be fine and reunites with his friends.\n\nCloud appears in \"On the Way to a Smile\", a series of short stories set between \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Advent Children\". \"Case of Tifa\" serves as an epilogue to \"VII\", and portrays Cloud's life alongside Tifa, Marlene, and Denzel. \"Case of Denzel\" relates how Cloud first met Denzel, and was later adapted as a short original video animation for the release of \"Advent Children Complete\", \"On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel.\"\n\nCloud acts in a supporting role in the PlayStation 2 game \"\".

During the game's conclusion, a dying Zack gives Cloud his Buster Sword, telling him that he is his legacy. The game ends with Cloud heading to Midgar, reprising the start of \"Final Fantasy VII\".\n\nThe OVA \"\" serves as an alternate retelling of Nibelheim's destruction and Zack and Cloud's escape from Shinra imprisonment. Animated and produced by Madhouse, based on a script by Kazuhiko Inukai, several scenes diverge from \"Final Fantasy VII\"'s depiction of events, such as reinterpreting Cloud's rescue of Tifa by having her view his face. Although it is associated with and makes references to the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\", \"Last Order\" is considered an outside work.\n\nCloud's character has also appeared in various games outside of the \"Final Fantasy VII\" continuity.

A digital replica of Cloud also appears in \"Kingdom Hearts coded\" in the Olympus Coliseum, helping Sora and Hercules to battle Hades.\n\nCloud serves as the representative \"Final Fantasy VII\" hero in \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\", a fighting game featuring characters from the \"Final Fantasy\" series. He is depicted in his \"Final Fantasy VII\" outfit, while his \"Advent Children\" appearance is also available. His fight against Sephiroth in this game is based on their battles from \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Advent Children\". Along with the entire cast, Cloud reappears in the prequel \"Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy\" as a Warrior of Chaos. Concerned for Tifa, who is on the opposing side, Cloud tries to defeat Chaos alone; after nearly being killed, he is saved by the goddess Cosmos, and becomes one of her warriors.

In commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of him alongside other \"Final Fantasy\" protagonists. Square Enix's manager of merchandise, Kanji Tashiro, said at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International that Cloud's likeness has produced some of the company's best-selling items, and that fans could look forward to further adaptations of the character in the future. Popular models at the time included Cloud's \"Advent Children\" figurine and \"Final Fantasy VII\" Hardy-Daytona bike set, both of which sold particularly well in European and North American markets. Square has also released two promotional books primarily focusing on Cloud's character: \"Cloud vol.1\", which was released in 2007, and \"Cloud message\", in 2008. In 2013, a replica of the Buster Sword was created by blacksmith Tony Swatton for the webseries \"Man at Arms\".\n\nCloud has been mostly well received by critics. In his review of the 1998 PC release of \"Final Fantasy VII\", Ron Dulin of GameSpot commented that \"a simple understatement will have to suffice: Cloud is easily the most interesting and complex character ever presented in a game.\" RPGamer's Abadi Aujang called Cloud \"one of the most complex characters Square has created\", as well as \"the first truly complicated main character\". Unicorn Lynx of MobyGames described him as \"one of the most complex characters ever seen in a game\", citing the struggle Cloud faces in assuming responsibility as a leader while confronting \"his own deep psychological problems\" and \"the truth about his very existence\". Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra stated that he is \"neither hero nor anti-hero\", but rather \"somewhat of a weakling\" suffering from grandiose delusions and other psychological issues. He also called Cloud one of the first unreliable narrators in a role-playing video game. Chi Kong Lui, writing for GameCritics, stated that while \"Final Fantasy VII\" features \"some of the most complex characters ever created, by video game standards\", their personalities are \"paper-thin\". He criticized Cloud's \"childish motivations\", stating that \"Final Fantasy VII\" could not \"match the depth of screenplay in Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" or the complexities of characters exhibited in Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\"\". \n\nGamesRadar included his cross-dressing scene in its list of \"[g]aming's most piss poor disguises\", commenting that \"it makes Cloud look so damn feminine, the escort-loving baddie chooses him over ... and Tifa\". Cloud and Aerith's relationship ranked third in GamesRadar's 2008 list of top Square Enix couples, who called it \"a classic love story\", while IGN ranked it ninth in their 2006 list of best video game couples overall. Cloud and Aerith have been cited as a well-known star-crossed love story.\n\nPSXextreme praised Cloud's redesign in \"Kingdom Hearts\" as one of the best in the game, describing it is a \"hybrid\" of his and Vincent Valentine's designs. According to AnimeFringe, Cloud's appearance in \"Kingdom Hearts\" was one of the things that excited \"Final Fantasy VII\" fans the most. His development in \"Advent Children\" was praised by DVD Talk as one of the best parts from the film. James Mielke of 1UP.com commented that Cloud's guilt over Aerith's death was effective enough to move viewers, but regarded such scenes as \"manipulative\". Michael Beckett, writing for RPGamer, referred to Cloud overcoming Aerith's death as central to the film, and called his fight sequences \"the most creative and impressive scenes\". \"Newtype USA\" also praised Cloud's role in \"Advent Children\" due to his heroic traits despite being a reluctant hero. Mielke also described the characters as \"beautiful; perfect almost\", commenting that Cloud possessed \"unbreakably perfect hair\". Briana Lawerence of Mania Entertainment, however, listed Cloud second in her article \"10 Male Headaches of Anime\", criticizing his feeling of guilt about Aerith's death. Joystiq's Andrew Yoon opined that the director's cut version of the film provides more depth to Cloud's development, taking advantage of its longer runtime by better \"humanizing [him]\". A 2010 GamesRadar article showcasing classic game character redesigns contrasted Cloud's appearances in \"Advent Children\" and \"Final Fantasy VII\", stating that the move away from low polygon models necessitated the change, and commenting that Square Enix alters the design with each title he features in. In another article, GamesRadar stated that while Cloud felt like a \"miserable\" character in the film, his coming on terms with his past was appealing alongside his new swords stored in his bike. Yoshinori Kitase stated that the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was popular enough to make Japanese gamers do a remake of it for the crossover \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\" and expected Western fans also emulate it.\n\nTasked with creating a \"female version of Cloud\" for \"Final Fantasy XIII\", Nomura designed Lightning with Cloud's success in mind, stating that he \"desired for her to be ... loved for a long time, like Cloud.\" After Lightning was voted as the most popular female character in the series by Japanese fans, Mollie Patterson of EGMNOW commented: \"Some have also brought up that Lightning is kind of the female equivalent to Cloud, which might be why she gets so much love.\"\n\nIGN stated that Cloud set a trend for role-playing video game heroes, describing his \"spiky blond hair\" and \"gigantic Buster Sword\" as \"instantly identifiable icons, recognized by gamers around the world\". \"Edge\" described Cloud as an example of \"excellent design and characterization\". \"Famitsu\" in 2010 published a seven-page tribute to Cloud, showcasing his many appearances throughout the years. In 2014, IGN held a poll for fans to vote for the most favorite \"Final Fantasy\" character of all time, as well as individually in each title. Over 2 million votes were cast in. Cloud ranked number one of all the characters. He also took the same place in the \"Final Fantasy VII\" title alone as well.\n\nCloud has appeared in various other lists. These include IGN's \"Worst Videogame Haircuts\" (2006) and \"Top Videogame Sword Masters\" (2008), and ScrewAttack's \"Top Ten Coolest Characters\" (2007). 1UP.com featured Cloud in their list of top \"Final Fantasy\" character types, citing him as an example of \"The Sullen Asshole\" alongside Squall Leonhart from \"Final Fantasy VIII\" and Cecil from \"Final Fantasy IV\". GameDaily ranked him fifth on their list of top \"gaming hunks\", praising his design and weapon.

In 2011, \"Empire\" ranked Cloud as the 13th greatest video game character, stating: \"He is, and always will be, the definitive \"FF\" poster child – an enduring axiom of character .\" GameZone ranked Cloud second in their 2012 list of top \"Final Fantasy\" characters, attributing the success of \"Final Fantasy VII\" largely to his character. In 2013, \"Complex\" named him the greatest \"Final Fantasy\" character of all time, citing his \"killer backstory, iconic weaponry, and a great game to the boot.\"\n\nIn an Oricon poll conducted in 2008, Cloud placed second overall for most popular video game character, ranking second among men and third with women. In a 2010 ASCII Media Works poll asking fans which video game or manga character they would like to name their children after, Cloud's name ranked third for male characters.

A descendant of a Jewish Syrian art family residing in Monaco and a cousin of the late Edmond Safra, he and his relations are perhaps the single biggest buying force in fine art. \n\nThe roots of the Nahmad family are in Aleppo, Syria, where Sephardic Jewish banker Hillel Nahmad lived until just after the Second World War. Following anti-Jewish violence in 1947, Hillel Nahmad moved to Beirut, Lebanon and when the situation there became difficult, Hillel took his three sons, Joseph (Giuseppe), Ezra and David, to Milan in the early 1960s.\n\nAs teenagers in the 1960s, they began to deal in art. Ezra and David skipped school to trade on the Italian stock market. At a Juan Gris exhibition in Rome organised by cubist dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Ezra and David bought two works – the only pieces sold. Kahnweiler befriended them, selling them works by Picasso, Braque, Gris. With the emergence of the Red Brigades terror group in the 1970s, Milan was perceived as too dangerous, and the family moved again. Joseph and Ezra headed for Monaco, and David to New York City. \n\nHelly Nahmad Gallery, on Madison Avenue, is a company run by David’s son Hillel \"Helly\" Nahmad, who took over his father’s earlier Davlyn Gallery in 2000.\n\nJeffrey Deitch, a former dealer and current director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, once described the Nahmads as \"like a major brokerage firm in the stock market\", adding: \"The market needs a force like this to function.\" Sarah Thornton discusses their significant influence on the auction market \"Seven Days in the Art World\"\".\"\n\nIn 2011, Philippe Maestracci filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking title to the 1918 Modigliani painting \"Seated Man with a Cane\", valued at more than $25 million. Maestracci claimed that the painting had been looted from his grandfather, Oscar Stettiner, during World War II. In 2012, after Defendants moved to dismiss, Maestracci’s counsel withdrew that complaint. In 2015, the Limited Ancillary Administrator for the Estate of Oscar Stettiner filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, seeking the same relief sought in federal court. The amended complaint in that action is currently the subject of a motion to dismiss with Defendants’ counsel arguing, among other things, that Defendants purchased the painting in good faith at a public Christie’s auction in London, that Oscar Stettiner did not actually own the subject painting, and that the case is being bankrolled by business people who specialize in funding restitution claims in exchange for obtaining a percentage of any recovery or settlement. Plaintiff's counsel contends that this painting had been sold out of the possessions of Jewish art dealer Oscar Stettiner by an administrator appointed under the Nazi occupation of Paris. In a letter filed in court on May 25, 2016, Eve Livengood claimed the painting was purchased by her husband's grandfather in 1944 and was in the possession of the family for over 50 years, until the Christie's Auction. Defendants' counsel has vigorously questioned the accuracy and authenticity of Ms. Livengood's letter.\n\nDavid Nahmad is also the 1996 Backgammon World Champion, and is known for betting large amounts of money on the game.\n"}

His state funeral was held on 24 February, when the late emperor was buried near his parents at the Musashi Imperial Graveyard in Hachiōji, Tokyo.\n\nOn September 22, 1987, the Emperor underwent surgery on his pancreas after having digestive problems for several months. The doctors discovered that he had duodenal cancer. The Emperor appeared to be making a full recovery for several months after the surgery. About a year later, however, on September 19, 1988, he collapsed in his palace, and his health worsened over the next several months as he suffered from continuous internal bleeding.\n\nOn January 7, 1989, at 7:55 AM, the Grand Steward of Japan's Imperial Household Agency, Shōichi Fujimori, officially announced the death of Emperor Hirohito at 6:33 AM, and revealed details about his cancer for the first time.

He was succeeded by his son, Crown Prince Akihito. With Emperor Akihito's accession, a new era began: the Heisei era, effective at midnight the day after Emperor Hirohito's death. The new Emperor's formal enthronement ceremony was eventually held in Tokyo on November 12, 1990.\n\nFrom January 7, 1989, until January 31, 1989, the late Emperor's formal appellation was . The late Emperor's definitive posthumous name, , was officially determined on January 13 and formally released on January 31 by Toshiki Kaifu, the Prime Minister.\n\nOn Friday, February 24, the Emperor Shōwa's state funeral was held, and unlike that of his predecessor, it was formal but not conducted in a strictly Shinto manner. It was a funeral carefully designed both as a tribute to the late Emperor and as a showcase for a peaceful, affluent society Japan had developed into during Hirohito's reign.\n\nUnlike the Emperor Taisho's funeral 62 years earlier, there was no ceremonious parade of officials dressed in military uniforms and far fewer of the Shinto rituals used at that time to glorify the Emperor as a near-deity. These changes were meant to highlight that the Shōwa Tennō's funeral would be the first of an emperor under the postwar democratic Constitution, and the first imperial funeral held in daylight.\nThe delay of 48 days between his death and the funeral was about the same as that for the previous Emperor, and allowed time for numerous ceremonies leading up to the funeral. The late Emperor's body lay in three coffins; some personal items such as books and stationery were also placed into them.\n\nThe weather on the day of the funeral was cold, there was a grey sky that drenched Tokyo with a steady rain.\n\nThe ceremonies began at 7:30 a.m. when Emperor Akihito conducted a private \"Ceremony of Farewell\" for his father in the Imperial Palace.\n\nAt 9:35 a.m., a black motor hearse carrying the body of the Shōwa Tennō left the Imperial Palace for the 2-mile-long drive to the Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, where the Shinto and state ceremonies were held. High, piercing notes of reeds broke the silence as the hearse bearing the Emperor's coffin drove over a stone bridge and out through the Imperial Palace gates. The air shook with the sound of cannon and a brass band played a dirge composed for the funeral of the Shōwa Tennō's great-grandmother in the late 19th century.\n\nThe motor hearse was accompanied by a procession of 60 cars. The route of the cortege through Tokyo was lined by an estimated 800,000 spectators and 32,000 special police, which had been mobilized to guard against potential terrorist attacks.\n\nThe path of the funeral procession passed the National Diet, the democratic core of modern Japan; and the National Stadium, where the emperor opened the 1964 Summer Olympics and heralded Japan's postwar re-emergence.\n\nThe 40-minute procession, accompanied by a brass band, ended when it pulled into the Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, until 1949 reserved for the use of the Imperial family and now one of Tokyo's most popular parks.\n\nAt the Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, the funeral ceremonies for the Shōwa Tennō were conducted in a Sojoden, a specially constructed funeral hall. The funeral hall was constructed of Japanese cypress and held together with bamboo nails in keeping with ancient imperial tradition.\n\nThe official guests were seated in two white tents located in front of the funeral hall. Because of the low temperatures, many guests used chemical hand-warmers and wool blankets to keep warm as the 3-hour Shinto and state ceremonies progressed.\n\nThe Shōwa Tennō's coffin was transferred into a palanquin made of cypress wood painted with black lacquer. Attendants clad in long gray robes, narrow tall black hats and black outsized wooden sandals, bearing white and yellow banners, shields and signs of the sun and moon, led a 225-member procession. Musicians played gagaku, the atonal court music. Next came gray-robed attendants carrying two sacred sakaki trees draped with cloth streamers and ceremonial boxes of food and silk cloths to be offered to the spirit of the late Emperor.\n\nIn a nine-minute procession, 51 members of the Imperial Household Agency, clad in traditional gray Shinto costumes, carried the 1.5 ton \"Sokaren\" (Imperial Palanquin) containing the 3-layered coffin of the Shōwa Tennō into the funeral hall, as they walked up the aisle between the white tents with domestic and foreign dignataries.\n\nBehind the coffin walked a chamberlain dressed in white, who carried a platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased monarch will wear to heaven. Flutes, pipes and an occasional drum beat sounded as the procession entered the ceremonial grounds. The new Emperor, Akihito, and Empress Michiko, carrying their own large umbrellas, followed the palanquin with other family members.\n\nThe procession passed through a small wooden torii gate, the Shinto symbol marking the entrance to sacred space, and filed into the Sojoden.\n\nThe events in the Sojoden were divided into a religious \"Sojoden no Gi\" ceremony, followed by the state \"Taiso no Rei\" ceremony.\n\nWhen the procession entered the funeral hall, the Shinto portion of the funeral began and a black curtain partition was drawn closed. It opened to reveal a centuries-old ceremony. To the accompaniment of chanting, officials approached the altar of the Emperor, holding aloft wooden trays of sea bream, wild birds, kelp, seaweed, mountain potatoes, melons and other delicacies. The foods, as well as silk cloths, were offered to the spirit of the late Emperor. \nThe chief of ceremony, a childhood classmate and attendant of Hirohito, then delivered an address, followed by Emperor Akihito.\n\nThe funeral continued as the black curtain closed, signalling the end of the Shinto portion of the funeral.\n\nAs the curtain parted again, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary opened the state portion of the funeral. At noon, he called for a minute of silence throughout Japan. Prime Minister Takeshita delivered a short eulogy, in which he said that the reign of the late emperor would be remembered for its eventful and tumultuous times, including the Second World War and the eventual reconstruction of Japan. One by one, foreign dignitaries approached the altar and paid their respects. Some merely inclined their heads; some bowed slightly.\n\nFollowing the state ceremony, the Shōwa Tennō's coffin was taken to the Musashi Imperial Graveyard in the suburban city of Hachiōji for burial. At Emperor Taishō's funeral in 1927, the trip to the Musashi Imperial Graveyard was carried out as a 3-hour procession, but at the Shōwa Tennō's funeral, the trip was made by motor hearse and cut to 40 minutes. Several hours of ceremonies followed there, until the late emperor was laid to rest at nightfall, the traditional time to bury emperors.\n\nAn estimated 200,000 people lined the site of the procession - far fewer than the 860,000 officials had projected. The Shōwa Tennō's funeral was attended by some 10,000 official guests, including emissaries from 163 nations and 27 international organizations. A large number of world leaders attended the funeral, including King Juan Carlos I of Spain, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, King Baudouin of Belgium, King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV of Tonga, King Hussein of Jordan, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of Bhutan, Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg, Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Managing Director of the IMF Michel Camdessus, Secretary-General of the OECD Jean-Claude Paye, U.S. President George H. W. Bush, French President François Mitterrand, Filipino President Corazon Aquino, Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, Indonesian President Suharto, the Prince Consort of Denmark, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Crown Prince of Norway, the Crown Prince of Thailand, and many others. \n\nIn total there were 55 heads of state, 14 members of royal families, 11 prime ministers, 19 deputy heads of state and other officials present, all of which required placing Tokyo under an unprecedented blanket of security. Because of security concerns for the dignitaries and because of threats from Japanese left-wing extremists to disrupt the funeral, authorities decided to scrap many of the traditional events that normally accompany funerals for Japanese monarchs. Officials also overrode protocol to give US president Bush a front-row seat, even though tradition would have put him toward the back because of his short time in office. Bush, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday afternoon, attended the funeral on Friday afternoon and departed for China on Saturday.\n\nJapanese officials said it was the biggest funeral in modern history, and the unprecedented turnout of world leaders was recognition of Japan's emergence as an economic superpower. The Shōwa Tennō was the longest-reigning emperor in Japanese history and the last of the major leaders from World War II. Many also viewed the burial of the Shōwa Tennō as the nation's final break with a militaristic past that plunged much of Asia into war in the 1930s.\n\nThe late emperor's wife, the Empress Dowager Nagako, did not attend the ceremonies due to a lingering back and leg malady.\n\nTo mark the funeral, the government pardoned 30,000 people convicted of minor criminal offenses. The pardons also allowed an additional 11 million people to recover such civil rights as the right to vote and run for public office, which they had lost as a punishment for offenses.\n\nThe late emperor's funeral, like the man it honored, was dogged by bitter memories of the past. Many Allied veterans of World War II regarded Hirohito as a war criminal and called upon their countries to boycott the funeral. Nevertheless, of the 166 nations invited to send representatives, all but three accepted. Some Japanese, including a small Christian community, constitutional scholars and opposition politicians, denounced the pomp at the funeral as a return to past exaltation of the emperor and contended that the inclusion of Shinto rites violated Japan's post-war separation of church and state. Some groups, opposed to the Japanese monarchy, also staged small protests.\n\nThe Shinto rites, witnessed by official funeral guests and held at the same site as the state-sponsored portion of the funeral, prompted criticism that the Government was violating the constitutional separation of state and religion. This separation is especially important in Japan because Shinto was used as the religious basis for the ultra-nationalism and militaristic expansion of wartime Japan. Some opposition party delegates to the funeral boycotted that part of the ceremony. During the funeral procession in Tokyo, a man stepped into the street as the cortege approached. He was quickly apprehended by police who hustled him away. At 1:55 P.M., half an hour before the hearse carrying the late emperor's casket passed by, policemen patrolling the highway leading to the Musashi Imperial Graveyard heard an explosion and found debris scattered along the highway. They quickly cleared away the rubble, and the hearse passed without incident. In total, the police also arrested four people, two for trying to disrupt the procession.\n\n"}

Hailing from the distinguished Cretan Kallergis family, a historic family of Mylopotamos, the roots of which lay in the Byzantine Empire and which had risen to prominence under the Venetian domination of the island. He was left fatherless at an early age and he was sent to Russia to the care of the Tsar's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Nesselrode, who appears in some sources is mentioned as his uncle. After completing his general studies he went to Vienna in order to study medicine. On the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence went to the Morea and joined the insurgents.\n\nOn 19 January 1822 he disembarked with his relatives, Emmanuel and Nikolaos Kallergis, and the officer Valianos in Hydra bringing with them ammunitions, whose worth was 100.000 rubles and a recommendation letter of bishop Ignatius Oungrovlachias.\n\nDuring the summer of 1825 he took on along with his compatriot Emmanuel Antoniadis the leadership of the campaign in Crete. On 2 August 200 revolutionaries occupied the Gramvousa’s fortress, in which many pirates assembled during the next months. The campaign failed while, according to the American Philhellene Samuel Gridley Howe, Kallergis was unsuitable for the leader’s position. \nSubsequently he participated in the Georgios Karaiskakis’ expedition in Roumeli and he was distinguished. In October 1826 he participated in the failed attack of Colonel Fabvier against Thebes (it was sent as reinforcement by Karaiskakis).\n\nOn January 30, 1827 he took part in the victorious battle of Kastella where he had significant contribution and on February 20 he defended strongly the area of the Three Towers, which was eventually conquered by the Ottomans but she had suffered several losses. He was captured by the enemy forces during the disastrous for the Greek troops battle of Phaleron, where he was leader of the Cretan fighters. Finally, he was released after paying a large sum of money from his family but during his captivity, his one ear was amputated.\n\nDuring the government of Ioannis Kapodistrias, Kallergis was one of his supporters. He served as his adjutant and he proceeded to the organization of a regular body of the cavalry, where he became deputy commander. After the governor’s assassination he had sided with Augustinos Kapodistrias and he actively participated in the civil conflicts of the time. During January 1832 he fought as a cavalry officer in the battles in Argos and in March in the battle of Loutraki where his and Nikitaras’ forces were defeated by the troops of Ioannis Kolettis.\n\nAt the same time, he followed a military career as an officer in the regular army while he was actively involved in the political issues of that period, first as a follower of the Russian party and then of the French party. In 1834, during the Bavarian regency and the Kolettis’ government he was imprisoned as a supporter of the Russian party, whose significant members had made at that time various uprisings in the Greek territory.\nIn 1843, as colonel of the cavalry, he was a leading figure of the 3 September 1843 Revolution against Otto which forced the king to dismiss his Bavarian ministers and grant a constitution. He was appointed military commandant of Athens, promoted to Major General and \"aide de camp\" to the king. In 1845 he was dismissed by the army and withdrew from Greece, occasioned by an incident between him and Queen Amalia. He went to London, where he became friend with Louis Napoleon, nephew of Napoleon I and later Emperor of the French, which he followed later in Paris and so he became follower of the French policy.\n\nIn 1848 he made an abortive descent on the Greek coast, in the hope of launching a revolution in the Greek kingdom. He was captured, but soon released and, after a stay in the island of Zante, went to Paris (1853). In 1854, during the Crimean War, he served as Minister of Military Affairs in the Alexandros Mavrokordatos cabinet—imposed by the British and French, and hence called \"Ministry of Occupation\" by the Greeks. Until Mavrokordatos’ arrival, Kallergis exercised authority as dictator, with the full support of the French occupation troops. This particular government recalled all the Greek officers who participated in the anti-Ottoman revolutionary movements in Thessaly, Epirus and Macedonia to return to Greece while by personal requirement of Kallergis, Otto's adjutants—Gennaios Kolokotronis, Spyromilios, Ioannis Mamouris and Gardikiotis Grivas—were dismissed, while the hitherto Minister of Military Affairs, Skarlatos Soutsos, was suspended.\n\nWhen he was minister, Kallergis formed for the first time in Greece a fire brigade. In September 1855, a serious episode of Kallergis with the royal couple entailed the fall of Mavrokordatos’ government. In 1861 he was appointed minister plenipotentiary in Paris, in which capacity he took an important part in the negotiations which followed the fall of the Bavarian dynasty and led to the accession of Prince George of Denmark to the Greek throne.\n\nIn 1866 he participated in the two-day government of Dimitrios Voulgaris as Minister of Military Affairs. In mid-1866 he returned to Greece as chief equerry of King George I. He proposed to the king to assign him the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arguing that with the help of the governments of France and Italy he would be able to accomplish the vision of the \"Megali Idea\", but King George didn’t believe it. In the summer of the same year he was elected by the Cretans as leader of the Cretan Revolt, but in September he refused the post because of health problems.\n\nIn January 1867 he was appointed as Ambassador of Greece to the United States but during the trip he fell ill in Paris and returned to Athens, where he died on 8 April 1867 of hemiplegia.\n\nKallergis was depicted on the reverse of the Greek 50 drachmas commemorative coin issued in 1994 for the 150th anniversary of the first Greek Constitution.\n"}
{"id": "768938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=768938", "title": "Dinka people", "text": "Dinka people\n\nThe Dinka people () are a Nilotic ethnic group native to South Sudan, but also having a sizable diaspora population. They mostly live along the Nile, from Mangalla to Renk, in regions of Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile (former two of three Southern Provinces in Sudan) and Abyei Area of the Ngok Dinka in South Sudan.\nThe Dinka mainly live on traditional agriculture and pastoralism, relying on cattle husbandry as a cultural pride, not for commercial profit or for meat, but cultural demonstrations, rituals, marriages' dowries and milk feedings for all ages. The Dinka cultivate food crops and cash crops. The food crops are grains, mainly sorghum and millet. The cash crops include groundnuts, sesame and gum-arabic. Cattle are confined to riversides, the Sudd and grass areas during the dry season, but are taken to high grounds in order to avoid floods and water during the rainy season.\n\nThey number around 4.5 million people according to the 2008 Sudan census, constituting about 18% of the population of the entire country, and the largest ethnic tribe in South Sudan. Dinka, or as they refer to themselves, \"Muonyjang\" (singular) and \"jieng\" (plural), make up one of the branches of the River Lake Nilotes (mainly sedentary agripastoral peoples of the Nile Valley and African Great Lakes region who speak Nilotic languages, including the Nuer and Luo). Dinka are sometimes noted for their height. With the Tutsi of Rwanda, they are believed to be the tallest people in Africa. Roberts and Bainbridge reported the average height of in a sample of 52 Dinka Agaar and in 227 Dinka Ruweng measured in 1953–1954. However, it seems the stature of today's Dinka males is lower, possibly as a consequence of undernutrition and conflicts. An anthropometric survey of Dinka men, war refugees in Ethiopia, published in 1995 found a mean height of . Other studies of comparative historical height data and nutrition place the Dinka as the tallest people in the world.\n\nThe Dinka people have no centralised political authority, instead comprising many independent but interlinked clans. Some of those clans traditionally provide ritual chiefs, known as the \"masters of the fishing spear\" or\" beny bith\", who provide leadership for the entire people and appear to be at least in part hereditary.\n\nTheir language, called Dinka or \"Thuɔŋjäŋ\" (\"Thoŋ ë Muɔnyjäŋ\"), is one of the Nilotic languages of the eastern Sudanic language family. The name means \"people\" in the Dinka language. It is written using the Latin alphabet with a few additions.\n\nAccording to oral traditions the Dinka originated from the Gezira in what is now Sudan. In medieval times this region was dominated by the kingdom of Alodia, a Christian, multi-ethnic empire dominated by Nubians. Living in its southern periphery and interacting with the Nubians, the Dinka absorbed a sizable amount of the Nubian vocabulary. From the 13th century, with the disintegration of Alodia, the Dinka began to migrate out of the Gezira, fleeing slave raids and other military conflicts as well as droughts.\n\nThe Dinka's religions, beliefs and lifestyle have led to conflict with the Arab Muslim government in Khartoum. The Sudan People's Liberation Army, led by late Dr. John Garang De Mabior, a Dinka, took arms against the government in 1983. During the subsequent 21-year civil war, many thousands of Dinka, along with fellow non-Dinka southerners, were massacred by government forces. The Dinka, led by Salva Kiir Mayardit, have also engaged in a separate civil war with the Nuer and other groups who accuse them of monopolising power.\n\nOn November 15, 1991 the event known as the \"Dinkas Massacre\" commenced in South Sudan. Forces led by the breakaway faction of Riek Machar deliberately killed an estimated 2,000 civilians in Dinkas of Hol, Nyarweng, Twic, Bor and others in villages and wounded several thousand more over the course of two months. It is estimated a 100,000 people left the area following the attack.\nJieng People also killed in 1991 tribal massacre were people of Khorfulus and Ngok Lual Yak where about 500 people were killed, over 7000 herds of cattle taken, and thousand of houses burnt. The area however remained under the control of SPLA under the command of late General George Athor Deng who later defeated Riek Machar's forces in Panyagor when he reinforced Wuor Mabior of Duk.\n\n\nThe Dinka's migrations are determined by the local climate, their agro-pastoral lifestyle responding to the periodic flooding and dryness of the area in which they live. They begin moving around May–June at the onset of the rainy season to their “permanent settlements” of mud and thatch housing above flood level, where they plant their crops of millet and other grain products. These rainy season settlements usually contain other permanent structures such as cattle byres (luak) and granaries. During dry season (beginning about December–January), everyone except the aged, ill, and nursing mothers migrates to semi-permanent dwellings in the toic for cattle grazing. The cultivation of sorghum, millet, and other crops begins in the highlands in the early rainy season and the harvest of crops begins when the rains are heavy in June–August. Cattle are driven to the toic in September and November when the rainfall drops off and allowed to graze on harvested stalks of the crops.\n\nThe Dinka (Jieeng) people has fifty six subdivisions: Rek of Wau (Dinka Marial Baai), Palieupiny Malual, Pajook Malual (Malual Gieernyaang/ Malual Buoth Anyaar), Paliet Malual, Abiem Malual, Twic Mayaardit, Kuac Ayok, Awan Chan, Awan Mou, Wan Parek, Aguok Kuei, Apuk Giir, Apuk Padooc, Apuk Jurwiir, Konggoor, Abiem Mayaar, Lou Ariik, Lou Paheer, Luac (Luanyjang), Luac (Luanykoth), Akook, Thiik, Jalwau, Nyang Akoc, Abuook, Atok, Noi, Leer, Muok, Yaar Ayiei Cikom, Thony, Gok, Kuei (Agaar), Rup (Agaar), Pakam (Agaar), Parial (Agaar), Yak (Agaar), Atuot, Ciec, Aliap, Bor, Twi (Twic of Jonglei), Nyarweng, Hol, Luac Akok(Luac of Khorfulus), Rut, Thoi, Ruweng Paweny, Ngok Lual Yak (Ngok of Malakal), Dongjol, Nyiel, Ageer, Abialaang, Ruweng Paanaruu, Ruweng Aloor and Ngok Jok (Ngok of Abyei). Noted that the Rek, Padaang, Malual and Agaar are groups which are composed of independent sub-divisions, each with known borders and a customary authority which managed the affairs of the section alongside governmental structures. In other word, there is no such thing as \"Rek paramount Chief, but Rek paramount chiefs.\"\n\nThe number of Dinka sub-divisions is hotly contested as the border or line between group, sub-division and sections is blurred and often difficult to determine. For example, one can divide the Atuot into Apak and Reel, Boor into Athooc and Gok, and Panaruu into Awet and Kuel and Ciec into Ador and Lou where Ador is sub-divided into Gok and Ajiek. Malual is the largest of those groups, numbering over a million people.\n\nThe Rek is an ethnic group in South Sudan, a subgroup of the Dinka. Its members speak South-Western Dinka, also called Rek, a Nilotic language. Many members of this ethnicity are Christians. Some estimates put the Rek population at or exceeding 500,000 people.\n\nThe Dinkas' pastoral lifestyle is also reflected in their religious beliefs and practices. Since the arrival of Abrahamic religions most revere one God, Nhialic, who speaks through spirits that take temporary possession of individuals in order to speak through them. The sacrificing of oxen by the \"masters of the fishing spear\" is a central component of Dinka religious practice. Age is an important factor in Dinka culture, with young men being inducted into adulthood through an initiation ordeal which includes marking the forehead with a sharp object. Also during this ceremony they acquire a second cow-colour name. The Dinka believe they derive religious power from nature and the world around them, rather than from a religious tome.\n\nSizable groups of Dinka refugees may be found in distant lands, including the United States (Jacksonville, Florida and Clarkston, a working-class suburb of Atlanta, Georgia and in the Midwest such as Omaha NE, Des Moines IA, Sioux Falls SD, and Kansas City MO), as well as Edmonton in Canada, and Melbourne and Sydney in Australia.\n\nThe experience of Dinka refugees was portrayed in the documentary movies \"Lost Boys of Sudan\" by Megan Mylan and Jon Shenk and \"God Grew Tired Of Us\", Joan Hechts' book \"The Journey of the Lost Boys\" and the fictionalized autobiography of a Dinka refugee, Dave Eggers' \"\". Other books on and by the Lost Boys include \"The Lost Boys of Sudan\" by Mark Bixler, \"God Grew Tired of Us\" by John Bul Dau, \"They Poured Fire On Us From The Sky\" by Alephonsion Deng, Benson Deng, and Benjamin Ajak and, \"A Long Walk to Water\" by Linda Sue Park. In 2004 the first volume of the graphic novel 'Echoes of the Lost Boys of Sudan' was released in Dallas, Texas, United States, chronicling in art and dialogue four lost boys' escapes from the destruction of their hometowns in South Sudan.\n\nHRW Banned, Censored, Harassed, and Jailed -Hellman/Hammett Grants Honor 42 Writers for Courage Facing Political Persecution.\nOn 6 May 2013 Mayom was given an awarded by the South Sudan Red Cross for his coverage of the humanitarian situation in Jonglei state.\n\n\n\n"}

His father came from Bohemia. Frank's formal education began with a degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A&M University in 1934.\n\nIn 1935, while a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Malina persuaded Professor of Aeronautics Theodore von Kármán to allow him to pursue studies into rocketry and rocket propulsion. The formal goal was development of a sounding rocket.\n\nMalina and five associates (including Jack Parsons) became known at Caltech as the \"Suicide Squad\" because of their dangerous experiments (and failures) when testing rocket motor designs.\n\nMalina's group was forced to move their operations away from the main Caltech campus into the more remote Arroyo Seco. This site and the research Malina was conducting would later become the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Malina served as the second Director of JPL.\n\nIn 1939, the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society) awarded Malina the Prix d'Astronautique for his contribution to the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics.\n\nIn 1942, von Kármán, Malina and three other students started the Aerojet Corporation.\n\nBy late 1945, Malina's rockets had outgrown the facility at Arroyo Seco, and his tests were moved to White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Here, the project's WAC Corporal sounding rocket was the first U.S. rocket to break the 50-mile altitude mark, becoming the first sounding rocket to reach space.\n\nDuring 1947, with rocket research in high gear, Malina's demanding travel and administrative schedule, along with a dislike of so much rocketry research being devoted to weapons systems and not scientific research, caused him to re-evaluate his career and leave Aerojet. Malina's passing interest in the Communist Party and labor activism while he was a graduate student in the 1930s had also attracted the attention of the FBI.\n\nHe moved to France and joined the fledgling United Nations as secretariat of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) under Julian Huxley. In 1951, Malina became head of UNESCO's division of scientific research. Two years later, Malina left UNESCO to pursue an interest in kinetic art. In 1952, at the height of the Red Scare, Malina was indicted for having failed to list his Communist Party membership on an old security questionnaire from Caltech. He was declared a fugitive, to be arrested if and when he returned to the United States.\n\nIn 1968 in Paris he founded \"Leonardo\", an international peer-reviewed research journal that featured articles written by artists on their own work, and focused on the interactions between the contemporary arts with the sciences and new technologies. The \"Leonardo\" journal is still published as a project of Leonardo/ISAST, the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.\n\nFrank Malina died in 1981 in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, France. His widow Marjorie Duckworth Malina died in 2006. Their sons Roger and Alan Malina live and work in France and Portugal, respectively.\n\n\n"}

Both parents were native New Englanders of colonial ancestry. George Henry Peabody, who came from a line of merchants, bankers and professional men, had moved from Connecticut to Columbus, Georgia, where he ran a prosperous general store. After attending private school in Columbus, young Peabody spent a few months at Deer Hill Institute in Danbury, Connecticut. The Civil War, however, impoverished his family, and in 1866 they moved to Brooklyn, New York, and young Peabody went to work as an errand boy.\n\nIn the evenings Peabody read extensively at the library of the Brooklyn Y.M.C.A., which he later called his \"alma mater\", and also took part in the activities of the Reformed Church in Brooklyn Heights, where he met and became good friends with young investment banker Spencer Trask. On May 2, 1881, Peabody became a partner in the new firm of Spencer Trask & Company. During the 1880s and 1890s this investment house took a leading part in financing electric lighting corporations, sugar beet and other industrial enterprises, and railroad construction in the western United States and Mexico. Peabody himself handled most of the firm's railroad investments, working in close association with William J. Palmer. He also became a director in numerous corporations. Peabody, his brother Charles Jones Peabody and Spencer Trask amassed a great portion of their wealth from the Edison Electric Company.

Morgan—protégé of New England businessman/philanthropist George Peabody—financier of Edison Electric, merged all into the General Electric Company in 1892, George Foster Peabody became a member of the GE board of directors.\n\nPeabody retired from business in 1906 to pursue a life of public service. Long interested in social causes, he supported such progressive ideas as the single tax as advocated by Henry George in his book \"Progress and Poverty\", free trade, women's suffrage and government ownership of railroads. He was active in the anti-war movement and also interested in education, particularly in the South and particularly for African-Americans. He served as director of the General Education Board, treasurer of the Southern Education Board and on the boards of trustees of the American Church Institute for Negroes, Hampton in Virginia, Tuskegee University in Alabama, the University of Georgia, and the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.\n\nFrom early in his life Peabody was interested in Democratic Party politics. In the early 1880s, he helped his close friend Edward M. Shepard organize the Young Men's Democratic Club of Brooklyn, took a part in the 1892 presidential campaign on behalf of Grover Cleveland, supported the Gold Democrats against William Jennings Bryan in 1896, then switched to more moderate monetary reform as a member of the executive committee of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention in 1897. In 1904 and 1905 he served as treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Although he declined to run for political office, and declined President Wilson's offer of a place on the Federal Trade Commission, Peabody was an unofficial counselor to many government officials. From 1914 to 1921 he served on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. In June 1932 Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then Governor of New York, visited Peabody for advice and support in deciding to run for President of the United States.\n\nPeabody served from 1884 to 1930 as a trustee of Hampton University, one of Virginia's historically black universities, where he established in the university library the Peabody Collection of rare materials on African-American history, one of the largest collections in the United States.\n\nIn 1901 Peabody donated land for Peabody Park at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\n\nHe funded the Y.M.C.A. of Metropolitan Columbus, in Georgia, built in 1903, believed to be the only marble \"Y\" building in the United States.\n\nAfter years of visiting the estate of his partner Spencer Trask in Saratoga Springs, New York Peabody agreed to succeed him in 1910 as chairman of the state commission set up to purchase and conserve the famous spa there, and in 1923 he acquired the property at Warm Springs, Georgia near his boyhood home. In 1924 he invited his friend Franklin Delano Roosevelt (who had recently contracted a paralytic illness) to visit the 90 degree Fahrenheit springs there, which Roosevelt eventually purchased and turned into the Little White House and the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, expanding it from a limited rehab center into a full-service center.\n\nWhile his formal education was limited and he had no college degree, Peabody received honorary degrees from Harvard and Washington and Lee Universities in 1903, and the University of Georgia in 1906. This latter institution was the recipient of much of Peabody's philanthropy, including funds to build a fireproof building to house the university's library. He also donated land to help reorganize the State College of Agriculture, and founded the university's School of Forestry.\n\nPerhaps Peabody's best-known legacy is the George Foster Peabody Awards, presented annually since 1941 by the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication for excellence in radio, and, since 1948, television broadcasting, followed by World Wide Web content in the late 1990s.\n\nA tall man, in later years he developed a mane of white hair, and wore a heavy mustache and pointed beard, becoming known for his dignified and courtly manner. He maintained a mansion in Brooklyn, where he entertained lavishly. He also purchased a summer home known as Abenia at Lake George, where he spent most of each year. He was frequently a guest at Yaddo, the Saratoga Springs estate of Spencer Trask and his wife, Katrina Trask, and from both estates he developed a wide circle of influence, including many persons from the literary world, church, business, and government, who came to enjoy his gracious hospitality.\n\nA longtime bachelor, in 1920, eleven years after Trask's death in a railroad accident, Peabody married his widow Katrina, and they lived at Yaddo until her death in 1922. Thereafter Yaddo became a great retreat for artists. Peabody continued to live on the estate, and in 1926 he adopted a daughter, Mrs. Marjorie P. Waite, a young woman whom he had come to know in connection with his civic and humanitarian activities and who aided him in them.\n\nPeabody died in 1938 at his home in Warm Springs, Georgia and is buried at Yaddo.\n\n\n"}

His parents were in the company of missionaries to Hawaii for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, sailing in 1836. His parents taught at the Hilo Mission boarding school founded by David Belden Lyman and his wife. He had one older brother and two younger ones born while at Hilo.\nIn 1846 the family moved to teach at a similar school at the Waioli Mission near Hanalei, Hawaii on the northern coast of the island of Kauai. There he had four more brothers, although one died young.\n\nHe graduated from Punahou School 1850–1860, and worked for Samuel Garner Wilder loading a shipload of guano from Jarvis Island. He then attended Yale from 1860 to 1862 where he studied civil engineering in the Sheffield Scientific School.\n\nWhen he returned, he and his younger brother Albert worked for Robert Crichton Wyllie on his Princeville Plantation. Albert would later buy the Princeville Plantation near Hanalei.\nGeorge leased and then bought Grove Farm from Hermann A. Widemann (1822–1899) starting in 1864.\nUsing his engineering training, he designed an irrigation system to bring water from the wet mountains to the sugarcane fields, an idea later copied by many other planters. He continued to grow the farm, and invest in related enterprises, such as other plantations on other islands, a guano fertilizer company of his own, and the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company.\n\nIn 1880 he was elected to the house of representatives of the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom. When the upper house (known as the House of Nobles) became an elected body in 1887, he served in it from 1888 to 1892. He was appointed as Minister of the Interior from November 8, 1892 to January 12, 1893. A few days later the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii ended the monarchy. \nThe upper house of the legislature then became the senate of the Republic of Hawaii where he was elected through 1898.\n\nAfter World War I, when the US Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a harbor on the island, Wilcox bought the entire bond issue to finance Nawiliwili Harbor.\nHe died January 21, 1933. Since he never married, his estate was left to his nephews. It was one of the largest estates in the territory at the time.\n\nYounger brother Albert Spencer Wilcox was born May 24, 1844, married Luahiwa, and then Emma Mahelona, became a wealthy plantation owner and politician, and died July 7, 1919.\nAnother younger brother Samuel Whitney Wilcox was born September 19, 1847 at Waioli, married Emma Lyman (daughter of the Hilo missionaries), had six children, and died May 23, 1929.\nAlthough Samuel's youngest son Gaylord inherited the farm, his two prominent daughters were Elsie Hart Wilcox(1874–1954), who became the first female territorial senator of Hawaii, and Mabel Isabel Wilcox (1882–1978) who led the restoration of the Waioli and Grove Farm houses into museums.\n\nWilcox Health and George Norton Wilcox Memorial Hospital are named for him; hospital founder Mabel Wilcox was a nurse and commissioner of public health.\n\nThe Grove Farm Company (incorporated in 1922) was kept in the family until it was sold to Stephen McConnell Case in 2000.\n\n\n"}

His book \"The Personall Reigne of Christ Upon Earth\" (1642) was popular in the 1650s.\n\nArcher lectured in London before being suspended by Archbishop Laud. In 1631 he was presented to All Saints' Church, Hertford by the Feoffees for Impropriations but had fled the country by 1637. He served as pastor of the English church at Arnhem until his death. He was probably influenced by Thomas Goodwin.\n\nIn \"The Personall Reigne of Christ Upon Earth\", Archer made a number of predictions. He argued that the conversion of the Jews would take place in either 1650 or 1656. He calculated this date by taking the 1290 days of Daniel 12:11 as years, and counting from Julian the Apostate, the dating of whose reign was uncertain. Archer also said that the papacy would disappear in 1666. He obtained this date by interpreting the 1260 days in Revelation 12:6 as years, and counting from 406, which is when he thought \"the Bishop of Rome began to usurp Papall power, and about that time some of the 10. Kingdomes in Europe began to arise.\" The ten kingdoms that Archer refers are those thought to be represented by the ten toes on the image that Nebuchadnezzar saw in Daniel 2, following a historicist interpretation. Thirdly, Archer predicted that Christ would return in around 1700 – this date being calculated by taking the 1335 days of Daniel 12:12 as years, and counting from the end of Julian the Apostate's reign. Archer argued that this would precede a literal thousand year reign of the saints on earth, but not with Christ literally present.\n\nKatherine Hermes suggests that Archer's book set the stage for the coalescence of the Fifth Monarchists in England.\n\n"}

He was also a notable pioneer resident of Vancouver.\n\nCambie was educated in England, and emigrated to the Province of Canada as a youth, where he learned to be a surveyor. In 1852, he found employment with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, moving to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) seven years later. With the Confederation of Canada in 1867, the CPR was contracted to build a transcontinental railway, which would link the new country and the adjacent colonies and territories of British North America. With the expansion of the railway into British Columbia, Cambie found himself as the chief surveyor for the CPR in the province. In this capacity, Cambie argued for a route through the Fraser Canyon, terminating at the small logging community of Granville on Burrard Inlet. He was convinced of the superiority of this route over the alternatives of Howe Sound and Bute Inlet after a trip down the canyon to Granville in 1874.\n\nCambie's views prevailed, and in 1876, he was made chief surveyor of the CPR's Pacific Division, a position he would hold for the next four years, following which he was promoted to chief engineer. His work completed, in 1887 Cambie settled in Vancouver, which had been incorporated as the successor to Granville the previous year. As he recalled in a later interview:\nThe area of which Cambie spoke is now located near the centre of downtown Vancouver, in one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the country, and the site of Cambie's home is now the location of Vancouver's tallest building, the Living Shangri-La.\n\nCambie was a prominent citizen of the nascent city, and was an important advocate for the development of its infrastructure. He was also instrumental in building Christ Church Cathedral, the major Anglican church in downtown Vancouver, where he was a key figure for over forty years (a memorial plaque commemorating him can be found inside the church). In this and other developments, Cambie's connections with the CPR — and especially, its president, William Van Horne — were crucial to his success, since the company owned much of the land around Vancouver. Cambie remained employed by the CPR, only retiring in 1921.\n\nCambie died in Vancouver in 1928 at the age of 91.\n\nThe following are named for Cambie:\n\n"}

He was best known for his role as Detective Nick Yemana on the television sitcom \"Barney Miller\".\n\nSoo was born Goro Suzuki on a ship traveling from Japan to the United States in 1917. He lived in Oakland, California, until ordered into internment along with other Japanese Americans during World War II. He was sent to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah and fellow internees recalled him as a \"camp favorite\", an entertainer singing at dances and numerous events.\n\nSoo's career as an entertainer began in earnest at the end of the war, first as a stand-up nightclub performer primarily in the Midwestern United States. He changed his name to Soo after working at a Chinese night club. \n\nDuring his years playing the nightclub circuit, he met and became friends with future \"Barney Miller\" producer Danny Arnold, who was also a performer at the time.\n\nSoo finally earned his big break in 1958 when he was cast in the Broadway musical hit \"Flower Drum Song\" in the role of the show M.C. and comedian Frankie Wing (\"Gliding through my memoree\"). He was working in San Francisco at the Forbidden City, a Chinese nightclub and cabaret, which was portrayed in the musical and movie.\n\nHe was offered the chance to go to Broadway on the condition that he change his name to something Chinese, as \"Flower Drum Song\" is set in San Francisco's Chinatown. At that time, he adopted the surname that he had used to leave the internment camp at Topaz, \"Soo\". Soo switched to the Sammy Fong role (Chinatown's \"Nathan Detroit\") during the run and played the role when the film version (1961) of the musical was made.\n\nSoo was first broadcast across America by Jack Benny on November 27, 1962, as the street-wise talent agent in \"Jack Meets Japanese Agent\". \n\nIn 1964, Soo played a weekly supporting role as Rocky Sin, a poker-playing con artist in \"Valentine's Day\", a comedy television series starring Anthony Franciosa that lasted for one season. During the next decade, he would appear in films such \"The Green Berets\" as a colonel of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the 1967 musical \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\", as well as making guest appearances on TV shows such as \"Hawaii Five-O\", \"The Odd Couple\", and two episodes of \"M*A*S*H\".\n\nSoo joined Motown Records in 1965 as one of their first non-African American artists. During his time there, he recorded a slow ballad version of \"For Once in My Life\" as the first male singer to do so. The record was never released and was shelved in the Motown archives. The song was soon after made famous by Stevie Wonder.\n\nSoo was cast in his most memorable role in 1975 on the ABC sitcom \"Barney Miller\" as the laid-back, but very wry, Detective Nick Yemana, who was responsible for making the dreadful coffee that, in one of the series' running jokes, his fellow detectives had to drink every day.\n\nSoo refused to play roles that were demeaning to Asian Americans and often spoke out against negative ethnic portrayals.\n\nSoo was married to Jan Zdelar, a model. The couple had three children and two grandchildren.\n\nSoo was diagnosed with esophageal cancer during \"Barney Miller\"s fifth season (1978–79). The cancer spread quickly, and Soo died on January 11, 1979, at age 61, at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center (now the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center). His last appearance on the show was in the episode entitled \"The Vandal,\" which aired on November 9, 1978.\n\nOn the show there was a running joke that Soo's character made bad coffee.

He held different government positions from 1963, when Kenya became an independent country, to 1975, when he was assassinated. He left behind three wives and many children. He was popularly known as \"JM\".\n\nJ. M. Kariuki was born in Kabati-ini town in Rift Valley province, to Kariuki Kigani and Mary Wanjiku. He was the only boy in a family of five siblings. In 1938, he briefly enrolled in Evanson's Day School, but dropped out shortly due to lack of school fees. He then started working for a settler's farm until 1946, when he won a bet in Nakuru Horse races. Using the bet's proceeds he then enrolled himself back to a string of schools and was able to finish his primary school education in 1950. Later, he joined King's College Budo in Uganda's Wakiso district for his secondary education.\n\nKariuki's political life probably started in 1946 in earnest, after listening to a Kenyatta speech denouncing the way colonial government was handling the natives in a political rally. It is, however, likely that he was political earlier than that. His parents had earlier on been forced to leave their home area, Chinga, located in the Nyeri native reserve, back in 1928 to work in the white highlands. There, they became squatters on a European settler's farm and were expected, as was the case with other African squatter families, to do the regular and seasonal jobs for wages. Such a trauma was certainly likely to have sharpened his political impulses.\n\nIn the late 1940s, he joined the primary school drama and role played in the fight against colonial rule. While in Uganda for his secondary education, he closely followed the struggles that local Kenyans were facing from the European settlers. On 22 October 1952, he finished his secondary school education and returned to Kenya. Shortly after that, Kenya was placed under state of emergency by the new Governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, and Kariuki joined the Mau Mau uprising. After Kariuki took his oath, he started working as Mau Mau liaison officer between Eldoret and Kisumu. He also helped in soliciting money, boots and housing for Mau Mau. This led to his arrest in his hotel, which was working as a front to his political work. He was then detained in various camps (including Kowop and Langata) from 1953 until his release, seven years later in 1960.\n\nAfter his release, he managed to secure Kenyatta's approval in starting Nyeri's Kenya African National Union (KANU) branch by visiting him in detention. When Kenya became independent, Kariuki worked as Kenyatta's private secretary between 1963 and 1969. In the late 1960s, Kariuki's relationship with Kenyatta became increasingly strained as Kariuki became increasingly vocal of Kenyatta's policy. Some of their disagreements were:\n\nIn 1974, he was elected as Nyandarua's member of parliament and became an assistant minister in the Kenyatta government between 1974 and 1975. This was despite the government having made every possible effort to thwart his re-election, because his popularity among ordinary Kenyans threatened to overshadow Kenyatta's own. He was last seen alive at the Hilton Hotel, accompanied by Kenyatta's bodyguard on 2 March 1975.\n\nKariuki's remains were found beside the Lake Magadi Road, south of Nairobi; his body had been burnt and left on an ant's nest. When the news of Kariuki's death broke, Nairobi University students marched in protest in the streets of the capital. The march was broken up by Kenyan riot police and the campus was closed down, not reopening during Kenyatta's lifetime.\n\nAltogether Kariuki was a larger- than-life figure on Kenya's political scene, and his violent demise was widely mourned by his compatriots. He had been a prolific giver and \"Expressive Giving\" best describes his philanthropy: it was prompted by his desire to express support in something larger than himself and reflected his vision for a nation whose citizens would be able to fend for themselves. Accordingly JM's mode of giving was designed to have a measurable impact on society as a whole.\n\nToday, JM is remembered by Kenyans predominantly as a hero. Increasingly he came to represent the force against the evils that have harmed the country to this day. A quote from him is widely remembered:\n\n\"In Kenya today, I can only see the dawn of a June morning rising majestically from the white oblivion into the serenity of life.\" – J. M. Kariuki (1974)\n\nKariuki wrote \"Mau Mau Detainee\", an account of his experience in camps during the uprising that led to Kenya's independence.\n\n\nA Parliamentary Select Committee was immediately established to investigate the circumstances surrounding Kariuki's murder. The Committee's report assigned senior police officers: Ignatius Iriga Nderi, Ben Gethi, Wanyoike Thungu, Patrick Shaw and other senior administrative officers and politicians, but no one was ever punished. It is most likely that the committee was the means used by Kenyatta's government to mitigate a potential revolt. When the report was finally released, the anger had subsided and likelihood of revolt was much lower.\n\n"}

At the age of twenty, he joined the armed forces in Buenos Aires, but later transferred to a regiment in Montevideo. During the British invasion of 1806, he was captured and sent to England. After the defeat of the British troops, he was released and went to Spain, where he fought in the Napoleonic Wars. When he returned to Montevideo in August 1810, he joined the independentist forces and was nominated military leader of the independentist armies of the \"Banda Oriental\", later Uruguay. His military successes in the various battles for Montevideo (including the Siege of Montevideo (1812-1814)) won him the post of the military leader of the campaign in Peru, replacing José de San Martín, who had to resign due to health reasons.\n\nIn 1815, the Constituting General Assembly of the provinces of La Plata elected Rondeau their Supreme Director, but due to his absence, he never served as director. Ignacio Álvarez Thomas was named acting Supreme Director in his place. After two defeats against the Spanish royalist troops in Peru at Venta y Media and Sipe-Sipe, he was relieved from his command in 1816. He returned to Buenos Aires, where he became governor for a brief stint from June 5 to July 30, 1818. In 1819 he became Pueyrredón's successor as Supreme Director (serving this time), but had to resign the following year after the Battle of Cepeda.\n\nSubsequently, Rondeau retreated to Montevideo and tried to keep out of the internal wars between competing generals of the independentists. Nevertheless, he led several military campaigns against the Indians and in the independence wars against Brazil. In 1828, after the Treaty of Montevideo, he was elected as the governor of the newly founded Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Rondeau occupied this post from December 22, 1828 until April 17, 1830, when he was forced to abdicate by his opponent Juan Antonio Lavalleja, who held the majority in the still young parliament. Lavalleja was named governor \"ad interim\".\n\nRondeau still served as general in the army, though. In the civil war of Uruguay from 1836 between the \"Blancos\" (\"White\") and the \"Colorados\" (\"Red\"), he fought on the side of the latter and served as their war minister. He was killed in 1844 during the Great Siege of Montevideo.\n\n\n"}

They originate from coastal Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa and in The Dang dist and near by Dharampur place of Gujarat. \n\nThe word \"Konkan\" and, in turn \"Konkani\", is derived from \" or . Different authorities explain etymology of this word differently.\nSome include:\nThus the name \"Konkane\", comes from the word \"\", which means \"the people of Konkan\".\n\nThe Konkani people speak different dialects of Konkani, their native tongue; although a very high percentage are bilingual.\n\nIn general, in Konkani the masculine form used to address a Konkani speaker is ' and the feminine form is . The plural form is \"Konkane\" or \"Konkani\". In Goa \"Konkano\" now refers only to Hindus, and Catholic Goans do not address themselves as Konkanos as they were banned by the Portuguese from referring to themselves this way. Saraswat Brahmins of Canara refer to the Konkanis as \" /\". This literally means \"our tongue\" or \"people speaking our tongue\". Though this is not common amongst the Goans, they normally refer to Konkani as ' or \"our language\". Sometimes \"\" can be used in the Goan context to mean \"people from my community\". \n\nA Konkani person is normally referred to as a \"Konkaniga\" in Kannada (Census of India, 1891). Many of the colonial documents mention them as the \"Concanees\", \"Canarians\", \"Concanies\".\n\nThe then prehistoric region consisting of Modern Goa and some parts of Konkan adjoining Goa were inhabited by the Homo sapiens in Upper paleolithic and Mesolithic phase i.e. 8000–6000 BC. The rock engraving in many places along the coast has proven the existence of hunter-gathers. Nothing much is known about these earliest settlers.\nFigures of Mother goddess and many other motifs have been recovered which do not really shed light on the ancient culture and language. Traces of Shamanic culture have been found in Goa.\n\nIt is believed that tribes of Austric origin like \"Kols\", \"Mundaris\", \"Kharvis\" may have settled Goa and Konkan during the Neolithic period, living on hunting, fishing and a primitive form of agriculture since 3500 BC. According to Goan historian \"Anant Ramakrishna Dhume\", the Gauda and Kunbi and other such castes are modern descendants of ancient Mundari tribes. In his work he mentions several words of Mundari origin in the Konkani language. He also elaborates on the deities worshiped by the ancient tribes, their customs, methods of farming and its overall impact on modern day Konkani society. The Negroids were in a Neolithic stage of primitive culture, and they were food-gatherers rather. Traces of Negroid physical characteristics are found in parts of Goa, at least up to the middle of the first millennium. The Proto-Australoid tribe known as the \"Konkas\", from whom is derived the name of the region, \"Kongvan or Konkan\" with the other mentioned tribes formed reportedly the earliest settlers in the territory. Agriculture was not fully developed at this stage, and was just shaping up. The Kols and Mundaris might have been using stone and wood implements as iron implements were used by the megalithic tribes as late as 1200 BC. The Kol tribe is believed to have migrated from Gujarat. During this period worship of mother goddess in the form of anthill or \"Santer\", was started. Anthill is called as \"Roen\" (Konkani:रोयण), this word has been derived from the austric word \"Rono\" meaning with holes. The later Indo-Aryan and Dravidian settlers also adopted anthill worship, which was translated to \"Santara\" in Prakrit by them.\n\nThe first wave of Vedic people came and settled from Northern India in then Konkan region about 2400 BC. Some of them might have been followers of Vedic religion. They were known to speak earliest form of Prakrit or Vedic Sanskrit vernacular. This migration of the \"northerners\" is mainly attributed to the drying up of the Sarasvati River in Northern India. Many historians claim only Gaud Saraswat Brahmins and few of the other Brahmins to be their descendants. This hypothesis is not authoritative according to some. Balakrishna Dattaram Kamat Satoskar a renowned Goan Indologist and historian, in his work \"Gomantak prakruti ani sanskruti\", Volume I explains that the original Sarasvat tribe consisted of people of all the folds who followed the Vedic fourfold system and not just Brahmins, as the caste system was not fully developed then, and did not play an important role.(see \"Gomantak prakruti ani sanskruti\", Volume I).\n\nThe second wave of Indo-Aryans occurred sometime between 1700 to 1450 BC. This second wave migration was accompanied by Dravidians from the Deccan plateau. A wave of \"Kusha\" or Harappan people a Lothal probably around 1600 BC to escape submergence of their civilisation which thrived on sea-trade. The admixture of several cultures, customs, religions, dialects and beliefs, led to revolutionary change in the formation of early Konkani society.\n\nThe Maurya era is marked with migrations from the East, advent of Buddhism and different \"Prakrit\" vernaculars. Greeks settled Goa during the Satavahana rule, similarly a mass migration of Brahmins happened from the north, whom the kings had invited to perform Vedic sacrifices.\n\nThe advent of Western Satrap rulers also led to many Scythian migrations, which later gave its way to the \"Bhoja\" kings.\nAccording to Vithal Raghavendra Mitragotri, many Brahmins and Vaishyas had come with Yadava Bhojas from the North (see \"A socio-cultural history of Goa from the Bhojas to the Vijayanagara\"). The Yadava Bhojas patronised Buddhism and settled many Buddhist converts of Greek and Persian origin.\n\nThe Abhirs, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Shilaharas ruled the then Konkan-Goa for several years which was responsible for many changes in the society. Later The powerful Kadambas of Goa, came to power. During their rule, the society underwent radical transition. Close contact with the Arabs, Turks, introduction of Jainism, patronising Shaivism, use of Sanskrit and Kannada, the overseas trade had an overwhelming impact on the people.\n\nIn 1350 CE, Goa was conquered by the Bahmani Sultanate of Turkic origin. However, in 1370, the Vijayanagar Empire, a resurgent Hindu empire situated at modern day Hampi, reconquered the area. The Vijayanagar rulers held on to Goa for nearly 100 years, during which its harbours were important landing places for Arabian horses on their way to Hampi to strengthen the Vijaynagar cavalry. In 1469, however, Goa was reconquered, by the Bahmani Sultans. When this dynasty broke up in 1492, Goa became a part of Adil Shah's Bijapur Sultanate, who made Goa Velha their second capital.\nThe Bahamanis demolished many temples, and forced the Hindus to convert to Islam. To avoid this religious persecution, several Goans families fled to the neighbourhood kingdom of Soonda.\n\nThe Portuguese Conquest of Goa occurred in 1510 on behalf of the Portuguese admiral Afonso de Albuquerque. Goa (also \"Old Goa\" or \"Velha Goa\") was not among the cities Albuquerque had received orders to conquer: he had only been ordered by the Portuguese king to capture Hormuz, Aden and Malacca.\nGoa Inquisition was established in 1560, briefly suppressed from 1774 to 1778, and finally abolished in 1812. The Goan Inquisition is considered a blot on the history of Konkani people and Goa. Its ostensible aim was to preserve the Catholic faith, the Inquisition's beginning in 1561 and its temporary abolition in 1774, some 16,202 persons were brought to trial by the Inquisition. Of this number, it is known that 57 were sentenced to death and executed in person; another 64 were burned in effigy. Others were subjected to lesser punishments or penanced, but the fate of many of the Inquisition's victims is unknown.\n\nThe inquisitor's first act was to forbid any open practice of the Hindu faith on pain of death. Sephardic Jews living in Goa, many of whom had fled the Iberian Peninsula to escape the excesses of the Spanish Inquisition to begin with, were also persecuted. Seventy-one \"autos da fe\" were recorded. In the first few years alone, over 4000 people were arrested. In the first hundred years, the Inquisition burnt at stake 57 alive and 64 in effigy, 105 of them being men and 16 women. Others sentenced to various punishments totalled 4,046, out of whom 3,034 were men and 1,012 were women. According to the \"Chronista de Tissuary\" (Chronicles of Tiswadi), the last auto da fe was held in Goa on 7 February 1773.\n\nAccording to Indo-Portuguese historian Teotonio R. de Souza, grave abuse was practised in Goa in the form of 'mass baptism' and what went before it. The practice was begun by the Jesuits and was later initiated by the Franciscans also. The Jesuits staged an annual mass baptism on the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (25 January), and to secure as many neophytes as possible, a few days before the ceremony the Jesuits would go through the streets of the Hindu quarter in pairs, accompanied by their slaves, whom they would urge to seize the Hindus. When the slaves caught up to a fugitive, they would smear his lips with a piece of beef, making him an 'untouchable' among his people. Conversion to Christianity was then his only option.\n\nThe inquisition was set as a tribunal, headed by a judge, sent to Goa from Portugal and was assisted by two judicial henchmen. The judge was answerable to no one except to Lisbon and handed down punishments as he saw fit. The Inquisition Laws filled 230 pages and the palace where the Inquisition was conducted was known as the Big House and the Inquisition proceedings were always conducted behind closed shutters and closed doors.\n\nAccording to the historian, \"the screams of agony of the victims (men, women, and children) could be heard in the streets, in the stillness of the night, as they were brutally interrogated, flogged, and slowly dismembered in front of their relatives. \"Eyelids were sliced off and extremities were amputated carefully, a person could remain conscious even though the only thing that remained was his torso and head.\n\nFr. Diago de Boarda and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz had made a 41-point plan for torturing Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy António de Noronha issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:\n\nI hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.\n\nIn 1567, the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. Enacting laws, prohibition was laid from 4 December 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation.\n\nAll the persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583 Hindu temples at Assolna and Cuncolim were destroyed through army action.\n\n\"The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers.\" wrote Filippo Sassetti, who was in India from 1578 to 1588.\n\nAn order was issued in June 1684 eliminating the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak the Portuguese language. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the symbols of non-Christian sects were destroyed and the books written in local languages were burnt.\n\nThe victims of such inhuman laws of the Inquiry Commission included a French traveller named Charles Delone. He was an eyewitness to the atrocities, cruelty and reign of terror unleashed by priests. He published a book in 1687 describing the lot of helpless victims. While he was in jail, he had heard the cries of tortured people beaten with instruments having sharp teeth. All these details are noted in Charles Dellon's book, \"Relation de l'Inquisition de Goa\" (The Inquisition of Goa).\n\nThe viceroy ordered that Hindu \"pandits\" and physicians be disallowed from entering the capital city on horseback or palanquins, the violation of which entailed a fine. Successive violations resulted in imprisonment.\n\nChristian palanquin-bearers were forbidden from carrying Hindus as passengers. Christian agricultural labourers were forbidden to work in the lands owned by Hindus and Hindus forbidden to employ Christian labourers.\n\nThe Inquisition guaranteed \"protection\" to Hindus who converted to Christianity. Thus, they initiated a new wave of baptisms to Hindus who were motivated by social coercion into converting.\n\nThe adverse effects of the inquisition were tempered somewhat by the fact that Hindus were able to escape Portuguese hegemony by migrating to other parts of the subcontinent including to Muslim territory.\n\nIronically, the Inquisition also had an adverse unintended consequence, in that it was a compelling factor for the emigration of a large number of Portuguese from the Portuguese colonies, who although Roman Catholic by faith, had now acculturated into Hindu culture. These people went on to seek their fortunes in the courts of different Indian kings, where their services were employed, usually as gunners or cavalrymen.\n\nIn stark contrast to the earlier intense study of the Konkani language and its cultivation undertaken by the Portuguese priests as a communication medium in their quest for converts during the earlier century, the Inquisition brought about xenophobic measures intended at isolating new converts from the non-Christian populations. This suppression of Konkani was in face of the repeated Maratha onslaughts of the late 17th and earlier 18th centuries, which for the first time posed a serious threat to Goa, and by extension, the Portuguese presence in India itself. The Maratha threat, compounded by their religious zeal, led the Portuguese authorities to initiate a positive programme for the suppression of Konkani in Goa. As a result, the ancient language of Konkani was suppressed and rendered unprivileged by the enforcement of Portuguese.\nUrged by the Franciscans, the Portuguese viceroy forbade the use of Konkani on 27 June 1684 and further decreed that within three years, the local people in general would speak the Portuguese tongue and use it in all their contacts and contracts made in Portuguese territories. The penalties for violation would be imprisonment. The decree was confirmed by the king on 17 March 1687. However, according to the Inquisitor António Amaral Coutinho's letter to the Portuguese monarch João V in 1731, these draconian measures did not meet with success. With the fall of the \"Province of the North\" (which included Bassein, Chaul and Salsette) in 1739, the assault on Konkani gained new momentum. On 21 November 1745, Archbishop Lourenzo de Santa Maria decreed that to qualify for priesthood, the knowledge of, and the ability to speak only in Portuguese, not only for the pretendentes, but also for all the close relations, men as well as women, confirmed by rigorous examinations by reverend persons was an essential prerequisite. Furthermore, the \"Bamonns\" and \"Chardos\" were required to learn Portuguese within six months, failing which they would be denied the right to marriage. The Jesuits, who had historically been the greatest advocates of Konkani, were expelled in 1761. In 1812, the Archbishop decreed that children should be prohibited from speaking Konkani in schools and in 1847, this was extended to seminaries. In 1869, Konkani was completely banned in schools.\n\nThe result of this linguistic displacement was that Goans did not develop a literature in Konkani, nor could the language unite the population as several scripts (including Roman, Devanagari and Kannada) were used to write it. Konkani became the \"língua de criados\" (language of the servants) as Hindu and Catholic elites turned to Marathi and Portuguese, respectively. Ironically, Konkani is at present the 'cement' that binds all Konkanis across caste, religion and class and is affectionately termed \"Konkani Mai\" (Mother Konkani). The language only received official recognition in 1987, when on the February of that year, the Indian government recognised Konkani as the official language of Goa.\n\nMost Konkani people today work as expatriates in western and gulf countries. Also large number of this population works within service sector. Many Konkani people choose Engineering, Medicine, Law as their career choices. Konkani People have made a great contribution to Kannada literature. Most of the Konkani people stay in Karnataka and are bilingual in Konkani and Kannada.\n\n\n\n"}

The prosecution focused mainly on DNA evidence that criminal forensics experts shows he had sex with the victims around the time they were killed. \"All the victims have several things in common: all were found dead during the same one and a half year period, all were left in secluded or obstructed locations, all were strangled, all showed signs that they were involved in a struggle, all were missing their shoes and all but one showed distinct signs of sexual intercourse,\" Prosecution Attorney Jim Kanatzar said in opening statements to the court.\n\nGilyard was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Pakistani names vary depending upon ethnicity and spoken language.\n\nSince the Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley, the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from Persian, Arabic and Turkish names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person’s \"most called name\", by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, Muhammad, the name of the prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person’s first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person’s most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. Ali is the 2nd most common given name for male in Pakistan. Females are usually given at most two names.\n\n\n\nUnlike the practice in Western countries, and other countries with predominant European influence, there is no one way of writing a full name in Pakistan. The most popular convention is to append the most called given name of the father to the person’s given names. Often, if the person has more than one given name, his full name consists only of his given names. Another convention is to prefix the person’s given name with a title, which is usually associated with his tribal ancestry. Due to western influence, appending rather than prefixing titles to given names is becoming more common. One notable exception is the title \"Khan\", common in people of Pashtun origin, which has always been appended rather than prefixed to given names. There are several titles used in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. \"Syed\", \"Shaikh\", \"Khawaja\", \"Pasha\", \"Mirza\" etc. are common. Less commonly, the tribal name itself is appended to the person’s given names. For females, tribal names or titles rarely figure in the person’s full name (although this is becoming more common due to Western influence). Instead her full name would be composed of her given names only, or if given only one name, her given name appended with her father’s most called name. After marriage, the full name would be her most called name appended with her husband’s most called name. In official documents, a person’s identity is established by listing both the person’s full name (however they may write it), and their father’s. For married women, the husband's name might be used instead of the father's. Official forms always contain fields for both names, and they are used together as A son/daughter/wife of B on ID cards, passports, diplomas, in court, etc. The problem with these naming conventions is that it is difficult to trace back family roots. Many Muslims have settled in Western world and this naming convention creates some problems as a father will have a different \"surname\" or \"family name\" from his children.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Though he was born and died in Milford, Connecticut, most of his life was spent in northwestern North America.\n\n Pond began his fur trading career with his father out of Detroit, Michigan. He traded throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Through his business he became acquainted with Alexander Henry the elder, Simon McTavish and the brothers Thomas, Benjamin and Joseph Frobisher. They formed the North West Company which developed a fierce rivalry with the Hudson's Bay Company. In search of new fur resources he explored west of the Great Lakes. In 1776–1778 he wintered at a fur post he established at the junction of the Sturgeon River and North Saskatchewan River near present-day Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. The site is today a National Historic Site.\n\nIn 1783, Pond's explorations led him to the Athabasca, a region stretching from Lac Île-à-la-Crosse to the Peace River. There he explored waterways around Lake Athabasca and determined the approximate locations of Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake from First Nations peoples of the area. From his notes and diaries Peter Pond drew a map showing rivers and lakes of the Athabasca region, including what was known of the whole area from Hudson Bay to the Rocky Mountains and interpolating his information to the Arctic Ocean or Northwest Passage.\n\nIn 1785, one copy of Pond's map, accompanied by a detailed report, was submitted to the United States Congress and a second to the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, Henry Hamilton. Pond needed financial support to carry his explorations to the limits of North America's northwest, but the British government was not forthcoming. A partner in the North West Company, founded in 1784, he was in charge of the company business in the Athabasca and Peace River areas. An ambitious man with a reputation for having a violent temper, he was implicated in two murders (one of a rival trader): Although acquitted on the murder charges, the company replaced him with Alexander Mackenzie. In the process of taking over the management of the business Mackenzie learned a great deal from Peter Pond about the Athabasca and Peace River region. Pond left the North West Company in 1788.\n\nMackenzie was intrigued by Pond's belief that the tributaries of that area, which could be seen gathering into a great river flowing northwestward, flowed to the Northwest Passage. Mackenzie took the initiative to follow up on Pond's belief and followed this great river to its mouth; the watercourse, now called the Mackenzie River, did in fact flow to the Northwest Passage section of the Arctic Ocean. Peter Pond had contributed to the mapping of Canada by drawing the general outline of the river basin that Mackenzie recorded in 1789. The maps that Peter Pond subsequently drew, based on his explorations and on the information provided to him by First Nations peoples, ultimately gained international recognition for Pond at the end of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1790, Pond sold his shares in the North West Company to William McGillivray. He returned to Milford, Connecticut, where he died in 1807.\n\n"}
{"id": "5156543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5156543", "title": "Piscataway people", "text": "Piscataway people\n\nThe Piscataway or Piscatawa , also referred to as the Piscataway Indian Nation, are Native Americans, once constituting the most populous and powerful Native polities of the Chesapeake Bay region. They spoke Algonquian Piscataway, a dialect of Nanticoke. One of their neighboring tribes, with whom they merged after a massive decline of population following two centuries of interactions with European settlers, called them \"Conoy.\"\n\nTwo major groups representing Piscataway descendants received state recognition as Native American tribes in 2012: the Piscataway Indian Nation and Tayac Territory and the Piscataway Conoy Tribe of Maryland. Within the latter group was included the Piscataway Conoy Confederacy and Sub-Tribes and the Cedarville Band of Piscataway Indians. All these groups are located in Southern Maryland. None are federally recognized\n\nThe Piscataway were recorded by the English (in days before uniform spelling) as the Pascatowies, Paschatoway, Pazaticans, Pascoticons, Paskattaway, Pascatacon, Piscattaway, and Puscattawy. They were also referred to by the names of their villages: Moyaonce, Accotick or Accokicke or Accokeek, Potapaco or Portotoack, Sacayo or Sachia, Zakiah, Yaocomaco or Youcomako or Yeocomico, or Wicomicons.\n\nRelated Algonquian-speaking tribes included the Anacostan, Chincopin, Choptico, Doeg or Doge or Taux, Tauxeneen, Mattawoman, and Pamunkey. Possibly slightly more distantly related tribes included the Accomac, Assateague, Choptank, Nanticoke, Patuxent, Pokomoke, Tockwogh and Wicomoco.\n\nThe Piscataway language was part of the large Algonquian language family. Jesuit missionary Father Andrew White translated the Catholic Catechism into Piscataway in 1640, and other English missionaries compiled Piscataway-language materials.\n\nThe Piscataway by 1600 were on primarily the north bank of the Potomac River in what is now Charles, southern Prince George's, and probably some of western St. Mary's Counties in southern Maryland, according to John Smith's 1608 map which also notes the several Patuxent River settlements that were under some degree of Piscataway suzerainty. The Piscataway settlements appear in that same area on maps through 1700 Piscataway descendants now inhabit part of their traditional homelands in these areas. None of the three state-recognized tribes noted above has a reservation or trust land.\n\nThe Piscataway relied more on agriculture than many of their neighbors, which enabled them to live in permanent villages. They lived near waters navigable by canoes. Their crops included corn, several varieties of beans, melons, pumpkins, squash and (ceremonial) tobacco. Men hunted bears, elk, deer, and wolves as well as beaver, squirrels, partridges, wild turkeys, and other small game with bows and arrows. Fishing, oyster and clam harvesting, and gathering berries and nuts in seasons supplemented their diets.\n\nAs was common in other Algonquian villages, Piscataway villages included several individual houses protected by a log palisade. Traditional houses were rectangular and typically 10 feet high and 20 feet long, a type of longhouse, with barrel-shape roofs, covered with bark or woven mats. A hearth occupied the center of the house with a smoke hole overhead.\n\nA succession of indigenous peoples occupied the Chesapeake and Tidewater region, arriving according to archeologists' estimates from roughly 3,000 to 10,000 years ago. People of Algonquian stock, which ultimately coalesced into the Piscataway nation, lived in the Potomac River drainage area since at least AD 1300. Sometime around AD 800, peoples living along the Potomac had begun to cultivate maize as a supplement to their ordinary hunting-gathering diet of fish, game, and wild plants.\n\nSome evidence suggests that the Piscataway migrated from the Eastern Shore, or from the upper Potomac, or from sources hundreds of miles to the north. It is fairly certain, however, that by the 16th century, the Piscataway were a distinct polity with a distinct society and culture, who lived year-round in permanent villages.\n\nThe onset of a centuries-long \"Little Ice Age\" after 1300 had driven Algonquian and Iroquoian peoples from upland and northern communities southward to the warmer climate of the Potomac basin. Growing seasons there were long enough for them to cultivate maize. As more tribes occupied the area, they competed for resources and had increasing conflict.\n\nBy 1400, the Piscataway and their Algonquian tribal neighbors had become increasingly numerous because of their sophisticated agriculture, which provided calorie-rich maize, beans and squash. These crops added surplus to their hunting-gathering subsistence economy and supported greater populations. The women cultivated and processed numerous varieties of maize and other plants, breeding them for taste and other characteristics. The Piscataway and other related peoples were able to feed their growing communities. They also continued to gather wild plants from nearby freshwater marshes. The men cleared new fields, hunted, and fished.\n\nBy 1600, incursions by the Susquehannock and other Iroquoian peoples from the north had almost entirely destroyed many of the Piscataway and other Algonquian settlements above present-day Great Falls, Virginia on the Potomac River. The villages below the fall line survived by banding together for common defense. They gradually consolidated authority under hereditary chiefs who exacted tribute, sent men to war, and coordinated the resistance against northern incursions and rival claimants to the lands. A hierarchy of places and rulers emerged: hamlets without hereditary rulers paid tribute to a nearby village. Its chief, or \"werowance\", appointed a \"lesser king\" to each dependent settlement. Changes in social structure occurred and religious development exalted the hierarchy. By the end of the 16th century, each werowance on the north bank of the Potomac was subject to the paramount chief: the ruler of the Piscataway known as the \"Tayac\".\n\nThe English explorer Captain John Smith first visited the upper Potomac River in 1608. He recorded the Piscataway by the name Moyaons, after their \"king's house\", i.e., capital village or Tayac's residence, also spelled \"Moyaone\". Closely associated with them were the Nacotchtank people (\"Anacostans\") who lived around present-day Washington, DC, and the \"Taux\" (Doeg) on the Virginia side of the river. Rivals and reluctant subjects of the \"Tayac\" hoped that the English newcomers would alter the balance of power in the region.\n\nIn search of trading partners, particularly for furs, the Virginia Company, and later, Virginia Colony, consistently allied with enemies of the settled Piscataway. Their entry into the dynamics began to shift regional power. By the early 1630s, the Tayac's hold over some of his subordinate werowances had weakened considerably.\n\nBut, when the English began to colonize what is now Maryland in 1634, the Tayac \"Kittamaquund\" managed to turn the newcomers into allies. He had come to power that year after killing his brother \"Wannas\", the former Tayac. He granted the English a former Indian settlement, which they renamed St. Mary's City after their own monarch.\n\nThe Tayac intended the new colonial outpost to serve as a buffer against the Iroquoian Susquehannock incursions from the north. \"Kittamaquund\" and his wife converted to Christianity in 1640 by their friendship with the English Jesuit missionary, Father Andrew White, who also performed their marriage. Their only daughter Mary Kittamaquund became a ward of the English governor and his sister-in-law, colonist Margaret Brent, both of whom held power in St. Mary's City and saw to the girl's education, including learning English.\n\nAt a young age, Mary Kittamaquund married the much older English colonist Giles Brent, one of Margaret's brothers. After trying to claim Piscataway territory upon her father's death, the couple moved south across the Potomac to establish a trading post and live at Aquia Creek in present-day Stafford County, Virginia. They were said to have had three or four children together. Brent married again in 1654, so his child bride may have died young.\n\nBenefits to the Piscataway in having the English as allies and buffers were short-lived. The Maryland Colony was initially too weak to pose a significant threat. Once the English began to develop a stronger colony, they turned against the Piscataway. By 1668, the western shore Algonquian were confined to two reservations: one on the Wicomico River; the other, on a portion of the Piscataway homeland. Refugees from dispossessed Algonquian nations merged with the Piscataway.\n\nColonial authorities forced the Piscataway to permit the Susquehannock, an Iroquoian-speaking people, to settle in their territory after having been defeated in 1675 by the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee), based in New York. The traditional enemies eventually came to open conflict in present-day Maryland. With the tribes at war, the Maryland Colony expelled the Susquehannock after they had been attacked by the Piscataway. The Susquehannock suffered devastating defeat.\n\nMaking their way northward, the surviving Susquehannock joined forces with their former enemy, the Haudenosaunee, the five-nation Iroquois Confederacy. Together, the Iroquoian tribes returned repeatedly to attack the Piscataway. The English provided little help to their Piscataway allies. Rather than raise militia to aid them, the Maryland Colony continued to compete for control of Piscataway land.\n\nPiscataway fortunes declined as the English Maryland colony grew and prospered. They were especially adversely affected by epidemics of infectious disease, which decimated their population, as well as intertribal and colonial warfare. After the English tried to remove tribes from their homelands in 1680, the Piscataway fled from encroaching English settlers to Zekiah Swamp in Charles County, Maryland. There they were attacked by the Iroquois but peace was negotiated.\n\nIn 1697, the Piscataway relocated across the Potomac and camped near what is now The Plains, Virginia in Fauquier County. Virginia settlers were alarmed and tried to persuade the Piscataway to return to Maryland, though they refused. Finally in 1699, the Piscataway moved north to what is now called Conoy Island in the Potomac near Point of Rocks, Maryland. They remained there until after 1722.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Maryland Colony nullified all Indian claims to their lands and dissolved the reservations. In the 1770s, some Piscataway, as well as other Algonquian groups migrating away from English settlements, relocated to Pennsylvania just north of the Susquehannah River. These migrants from the general area of Maryland are referred to as the Conoy and the Nanticoke. They were spread along the western edge of the Pennsylvania Colony, along with the Algonquian Lenape who had moved west from modern New Jersey, the Tutelo, the Shawnee and some Iroquois. The Piscataway were said to number only about 150 people at that time. They sought the protection of the powerful \"Haudenosaunee\", but the Pennsylvania Colony also proved unsafe.\n\nMost of the surviving tribe migrated north in the late eighteenth century and were last noted in the historical record in 1793 at Detroit, following the American Revolutionary War, when the United States gained independence. In 1793 a conference in Detroit reported the peoples had settled in Upper Canada, joining other Native Americans who had been allies of the British in the conflict. Today, descendants of the northern migrants live on the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSome Piscataway may have moved south toward the Virginia Colony. They were believed to merge with the Meherrin.\n\nNumerous contemporary historians and archaeologists, including William H. Gilbert, Frank G. Speck, Helen Rountree, Lucille St. Hoyme, Paul Cissna, T. Dale Stewart, Christopher Goodwin, Christian Feest, James Rice, and Gabrielle Tayac, have documented that a small group of Piscataway families continued to live in their homeland. Although the larger tribe was destroyed as an independent, sovereign polity, descendants of the Piscataway survived. They formed unions with others in the area, including European indentured servants and free or enslaved Africans. They settled into rural farm life and were classified as free people of color, but some kept Native American cultural traditions. For years the United States censuses did not have separate categories for Indians. Especially in the slave states, all free people of color were classified together as black, in the hypodescent classification resulting from the racial caste of slavery.\n\nIn the late 19th century, archaeologists, journalists, and anthropologists interviewed numerous residents in Maryland who claimed descent from tribes associated with the former Piscataway chiefdom. Uniquely among most institutions, the Catholic Church consistently continued to identify Indian families by that classification in their records. Such church records became valuable resources for scholars and family and tribal researchers. Anthropologists and sociologists categorized the self-identified Indians as a tri-racial community. They were commonly called a name (regarded as derogatory by some) \"Wesorts.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, census enumerators classified most of the Piscataway individuals as \"free people of color\", \"Free Negro\" or \"mulatto\" on state and federal census records, largely because of their intermarriage with blacks and Europeans. The dramatic drop in Native American populations due to infectious disease and warfare, plus a racial segregation based on slavery, led to a binary view of race in the former colony. By contrast, Catholic parish records in Maryland and some ethnographic reports accepted Piscataway self-identification and continuity of culture as Indians, regardless of mixed ancestry. Such a binary division of society in the South increased after the American Civil War and the emancipation of slaves. Southern whites struggled to regain political and social dominance of their societies during and after the Reconstruction era. They were intent on controlling the freedmen and asserting white supremacy.\n\nAlthough a few families identified as Piscataway by the early 20th century, prevailing racial attitudes during the late 19th century, and imposition of Jim Crow policies, over-determined official classification of minority groups of color as black. In the 20th century, Virginia and other southern states passed laws to enforce the \"one-drop rule\", classifying anyone with a discernible amount of African ancestry as \"negro\", \"mulatto\", or \"black\". For instance, in Virginia, Walter Plecker, Registrar of Statistics, ordered records to be changed so that members of Indian families were recorded as black, resulting in Indian families losing their ethnic identification.\n\nPhillip Sheridan Proctor, later known as Turkey Tayac, was born in 1895. Proctor revived the use of the title \"tayac\", a hereditary office which he claimed had been handed down to him. Turkey Tayac was instrumental in the revival of American Indian culture among Piscataway and other Indian descendants throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. He was allied with the American Indian Movement Project for revitalization.\n\nChief Turkey Tayac was a prominent figure in the early and mid-twentieth century cultural revitalization movements. His leadership inspired tribes other than the Piscataway, and revival has also occurred among other Southeastern American Indian communities. These include the Lumbee, Nanticoke, and Powhatan of the Atlantic coastal plain. Assuming the traditional leadership title \"tayac\" during an era when American Indian identity was being regulated to some extent by blood quantum, outlined in the Indian Reorganization Act, Chief Turkey Tayac organized a movement for American Indian peoples that gave priority to their self-identification.\n\nThere are still Indian people in southern Maryland, living without a reservation in the vicinity of US 301 between La Plata and Brandywine. They are formally organized into several groups, all bearing the Piscataway name.\n\nAfter Chief Turkey Tayac died in 1978, the Piscataway split into the Piscataway Conoy Confederacy and Subtribes (PCCS), the Cedarville Band of Piscataway Indians, and the Piscataway Indian Nation. These three organizations have disagreed over a number of issues: seeking state and federal tribal recognition, developing casinos on their land if recognition were gained, and determining which groups were legitimately Piscataway.\n\nTwo organized Piscataway groups have formed:\n\nIn the late 1990s, after conducting an exhaustive review of primary sources, a Maryland-state appointed committee, including a genealogist from the Maryland State Archives, validated the claims of core Piscataway families to Piscataway heritage. A fresh approach to understanding individual and family choices and self-identification among American Indian and African-American cultures is underway at several research universities. Unlike during the years of racial segregation, when all people of any African descent were classified as black, new studies emphasize the historical context and evolution of seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century ethnic cultures and racial categories.\n\nThe State of Maryland appointed a panel of anthropologists, genealogists, and historians to review primary sources related to Piscataway genealogy. The panel concluded that some contemporary self-identified Piscataway descended from the historic Piscataway.\n\nIn 1996 the Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs (MCIA) suggested granting state recognition to the Picataway Conoy Confederacy and Subtribes. Critics were concerned about some of the development interests that backed the Piscataway Conoy campaign, and feared gaming interests. (Since the late twentieth century, many recognized tribes have established casinos and gaming entertainment on their reservations to raise revenues.) Gov. Parris Glendening, who was opposed to gambling, denied the tribe's request.\n\nIn 2004, Governor Bob Ehrlich also denied the Piscataway Conoy's renewed attempt for state recognition, stating that they failed to prove that they were descendants of the historical Piscataway Indians, as required by state law. Throughout this effort, the Piscataway-Conoy stated they had no intent to build and operate casinos.\n\nIn December 2011, the Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs stated that the Piscataway had provided adequate documentation of their history and recommended recognition. On January 9, 2012, Gov. Martin O'Malley issued executive orders recognizing all three Piscataway groups as Native American tribes. As part of the agreement that led to recognition, the tribes renounced any plans to launch gambling enterprises, and the executive orders state that the tribes do not grant any special \"gambling privileges\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12971440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12971440", "title": "Salvadorans", "text": "Salvadorans\n\nThe Salvadorans (Spanish: Salvadoreños) are people who identify with El Salvador. Salvadorans are mainly Mestizos (mixed European and Amerindian heritage), indigenous people or Amerindians and descendants from European people. Most Salvadorans live in El Salvador, although there is also a significant Salvadoran diaspora, particularly in the United States, with smaller communities in other countries around the world.\n\nEl Salvador's population was 6,218,000 in 2010, compared to 2,200,000 in 1950. In 2010, the percentage of the population below the age of 15 was 32.1%, 61% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 6.9% were 65 years or older.\n\n \nEl Salvador was inhabited by Paleo-Indians, the first peoples who subsequently inhabited, the Americas during the glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period. Their intriguing paintings (the earliest of which date from 8000 BC) can still be seen and marveled at in caves outside the towns of Corinto and Cacaopera, both in Morazán. Originating in the Paleolithic period, these cave paintings exhibit the earliest traces of human life in El Salvador; these early Native Americans people used the cave as a refuge, Paleoindian artists created cave and rock paintings that are located in present-day El Salvador.\nThe Lencas later occupied the cave and utilised it as a spiritual place. Other ancient petroglyphs called piedras pintadas (rock paintings) include la Piedra Pintada in San Jose Villanueva, La Libertad and the piedra pintada in San Isidro, Cabañas. The rock petroglyphs in San Jose Villanueva near a cave in (Walter Thilo Deininger National Park) are similar to other ancient rock petroglyph around the country. Regarding the style of the engravings it has been compared by with the petroglyphs of La Peña Herrada (Cuscatlán), el Letrero del Diablo (La Libertad) and la Peña de los Fierros (San Salvador). We can add to the list the sites in Titihuapa, the Cave of Los Fierros and La Cuevona both in ( Cuscatlán ).\n\nNative Americans appeared in the Pleistocene era and became the dominant people in the Lithic stage, developing in the Archaic period in North America to the Formative stage, occupying this position for thousands of years until their demise at the end of the 15th and 16th century, spanning the time of the original arrival in the Upper Paleolithic to European colonization of the Americas during the early modern period.\nAbout 40,000 years ago the ancestors of the indigenous people of the Americas split from the rest of the world following the Pleistocene megafauna and then they flourish mightily, evolving in the Americas, from the Lithic stage to the Post-Classic stage, which was brought into an abrupt end about 525 years ago with the infamous mass genocide and cultural extinction caused by Europeans intrusion into the Americas, bringing diseases and colonizing the Americas with warfare, terrorism, extremists radical Christianity and mass massacres. Only some Native American indigenous groups survived that catastrophe, most of them in Mexico, Central America and South America, with Salvadoran indigenous being one of many who have given rise to all modern Native Americans still alive today.\n\nHistorically El Salvador has had diverse Native American cultures, coming from the north and south of the continent along with local populations mixed together. El Salvador belongs to both to the Mesoamerican region in the western part of the country, and to the Isthmo-Colombian Area in the eastern part of the country, where a myriad of indigenous societies have lived side by side for centuries with their unique cultures and speaking different indigenous languages of the Americas in the beginning of the Classic stage.\nThe Lenca people are an indigenous people of eastern El Salvador where population today is estimated at about 37,000. The Lenca was a matriarchal society and was one of the first civilizations to develop in El Salvador and were the first major civilization in the country. The pre-Conquest Salvadoran Lenca had frequent contact with various Maya groups as well as other indigenous peoples of Central America. The origin of Lenca populations has been a source of ongoing debate amongst anthropologists and historians. Throughout the regions of Lenca occupation, Lenca pottery is a very distinguishable form of Pre-Columbian art. Handcrafted by Lenca women, Lenca pottery is considered an ethnic marking of their culture. Some scholars have suggested that the Lenca migrated to the Central American region from South America around 3,000 years ago, making it the oldest civilization in El Salvador. Guancasco is the annual ceremony by which Lenca communities, usually two, gather to establish reciprocal obligations in order to confirm peace and friendship. Quelepa is a major site in eastern El Salvador. Its pottery shows strong similarities to ceramics found in central western El Salvador and the Maya highlands. The Lenca sites of Yarumela, Los Naranjos in Honduras, and Quelepa in El Salvador, all contain evidence of the Usulután-style ceramics.\nThe Cacaopera people are an indigenous people in El Salvador who are also known as the Matagalpa or Ulua. Cacaopera people spoke the Cacaopera language, a Misumalpan language. Cacaopera is an extinct language belonging to the Misumalpan family, formerly spoken in the department of Morazán in El Salvador. It was closely related to Matagalpa, and slightly more distantly to Sumo, but was geographically separated from other Misumalpan languages.\nThe Xinca people, also known as the Xinka, are a non-Mayan indigenous people of Mesoamerica, with communities in the western part of El Salvador near its border. The Xinka may have been among the earliest inhabitants of western El Salvador, predating the arrival of the Maya and the Pipil. The Xinca ethnic group became extinct in the Mestizo process.\nEl Salvador has two Maya groups, the Poqomam people and the Ch'orti' people. The Poqomam are a Maya people in western El Salvador near its border. Their indigenous language is also called Poqomam. The Ch'orti' people (alternatively, Ch'orti' Maya or Chorti) are one of the indigenous Maya peoples, who primarily reside in communities and towns of northern El Salvador. The Maya once dominated the entire western portion of El Salvador, up until the eruption of the lake ilopango super volcano. Mayan ruins are the most widely conserved in El Salvador and artifacts such as Maya ceramics Mesoamerican writing systems Mesoamerican calendars and Mesoamerican ballgame can be found in all Maya ruins in El Salvador which include Tazumal, San Andrés, El Salvador, Casa Blanca, El Salvador, Cihuatan, and Joya de Ceren.\nAlaguilac people were a former indigenous group located on northern El Salvador. Their language is unclassified. The Alagüilac language is an undocumented indigenous American language that is now extinct. The Alaguilac ethnic group became extinct during the Mestizo process.\nThe Mixe people is an indigenous group that inhabited the western borders of El Salvador. They spoke the Mixe languages which are classified in the Mixe–Zoque family, The Mixe languages are languages of the Mixean branch of the Mixe–Zoquean language family. The Mixe ethnic group became extinct during the Mestizo process.\n\nThe Mangue people, also known as Chorotega, spoke the Mangue language, a now-extinct Oto-Manguean language. They were indigenous to eastern El Salvador border, near the gulf.\nThe Pipil people are an indigenous people who live in western El Salvador. Their language is called Nahuat or Pipil, related to the Toltec people of the Nahua peoples and were speakers of early Nahuatl languages. However, in general, their mythology is more closely related to the Maya mythology, who are their near neighbors and by oral tradition said to have been adopted by Ch'orti' and Poqomam Mayan people during the Pipil exodus in the 9th century CE. The culture lasted until the Spanish conquest, at which time they still maintained their Nawat language, despite being surrounded by the Maya in western El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived, Pipil and Poqomam Maya settlements were interspersed throughout western El Salvador. The Pipil are known as the last indigenous civilization to arrive in El Salvador, being the least oldest and were a determined people who stoutly resisted Spanish efforts to extend their dominion southward. The Pipil are direct descendants of the Toltecs, but not of the Aztecs.\nEvidence of Olmec civilization presence in western El Salvador can be found in the ruin sites of Chalchuapa in the Ahuachapan department. Olmec petroglyphs can be found on boulders in Chalchuapa portraying Omlec warriors with helmets identical to those found on the Olmec colossal heads. This suggest that the area was once an Olmec enclave, before fading away for unknown reasons. The Olmecs are believed to have lived in present-day El Salvador as early as 2000 BC. The 'Olmec Boulder, ' is a sculpture of a giant head found near Casa Blanca, El Salvador site in Las Victorias near Chalchuapa. \"Olmecoid\" figurins such as the Potbelly sculpture have been found through this area, in fact most are described as looking primeval proto-Olmec.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest, the area was composed of several indigenous states of the Post-Classic stage who resisted the Europeans as Central America was ravaged by epidemics of diseases, sometimes the Spanish purpously resorted to spreading diseases such as smallpox, measles, and cholera. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Typhus in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, measles in 1618—all ravaged the remains of any indigenous force.\n\nThe Spanish traveled to Central America in the 15th century to discover a lush world, which was inhabited by many Native American indigenous civilizations. To the cultures of Europe, Central America was mysterious, primal and terrifying. El Salvador has lush, tropical rainforests that cover much of its volcanic surface and the geology of El Salvador is strongly affected by the presence of volcanoes, ellecuent with highly nutritious soil full of mineral, excellent for agriculture. These properties made it highly valued by Europeans, who exploited it for transport back to Spain. When the Europeans began to search El Salvador for valuable metals, the natives were appalled and angered by the destruction of their tropical home and felt that the damage done by Europeans in the pursuit of underground metals was nothing more than senseless destruction that violated the basic tenets of their beliefs. The expansion of the Spanish mining colony and smallpox threatened the continued existence of the indigenous natives in El Salvador. Despite its small size, El Salvador had a plethora of diverse civilizations with many languages and cultures, but expansion of the Spanish colony threatened the continued existence of the Lenca, Maya and Pipil, Native American people indigenous to El Salvador.\n\nWhen Pedro de Alvarado arrived in the Cuzcatlan kingdom, he saw that all civilians, women, children and elders, in towns and large urban centers had been mandatorily evacuated to a safe unknown location. The warriors of Cuzcatan had deployed to their battle stations in Acajutla and waited for Pedro de Alvarado and his forces in that coastal city. Pedro de Alvarado approached confident trusting that the result was going to be like in Mexico and Guatemala where the people saw them as gods, and thought he was going to easily defeat this new indigenous force because his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language and communication was going to be easy and fast. However unlike in Mexico and Guatemala, the Indigenous peoples of El Salvador never saw the Spanish as gods, but as foreign, gold lusting, barbaric, alien invaders who would resort to anything to steal away their land. Once Pedro de Alvarado arrived, he saw the shock troops of the Cuzcatlan kingdom in Acajutla ready for battle, he saw that the Cuzcatan force had a significantly large number of soldiers, which easily outnumbers his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies, once he saw this he order his army for the first time to quickly retreat, but the Cuzcatlec army was not satisfied by this and made a decisive shock and awe attack on the Spanish army, running behind them war chanting and shooting bow arrows, Pedro de Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive. Pedro de Alvarado describes the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail with shields made of colorful exotic feathers, a vest-like armor made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate and large spears. The Cuzcatlec soldiers were so fully armed, that those who were wounded by the Spanish guns and swords, found it difficult to get up because of their wounds and heavy armor. Both armies suffered great casualties, a wounded Pedro de Alvarado retreated losing a lot of men especially close Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had gathered Pedro de Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan metropolis capital; however, half way the same Cuzcatlan army was waiting for them.\n\nWounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Pedro de Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec platoons to see if they would fear the horses, however the Indigenous warriors stood their ground and did not move an inch, as Pedro de Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez. Pedro de Alvarado was so stunned and imprinted with their monumental military power and size which he described as large number of male warriors in colorful feather armors and long spears, a large army of indigenous men which eerily spooked him. The Cuzcatlec shock troops made another decisive shock and awe attacked on the Spanish on which both sides lost men, but this time Pedro de Alvarado lost many Spaniards, horses, and weapons which the Natives of Cuzcatlan had taken.\n\nPedro de Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to communicate with the Cuzcatlan warriors, Pedro de Alvarado sent for them to return the stolen weapons and to surrender to the Spanish king, to which the Cuzcatecs responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Pedro de Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messenger never came back and were presumably executed. The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Lenca and their Mayan-speaking neighbors, defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican Tlaxcala Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala, it was Pedro de Alvarado first defeat.\n\nAfter being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of San Miguel , headed by another explorer and conquistador, Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.\n\nThe kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of Intibucá.\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to Lempira (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\nHistorical evidence and census supports the explanation of \"strong sexual asymmetry\", as a result of a strong bias favoring matings between European males and Native American females, and to the important indigenous male mortality during the Conquest. The genetics thus suggests the native men were sharply reduced in numbers due to the war and disease. Large numbers of Spaniard men settled in the region and married or forced themselves with the local women. The Natives were forced to adopted Spanish names, language, and religion, and in this way, the Lencas, Mayas and Pipil women and children were Hispanicized. A vast majority over 90% of Salvadorans are Mestizo/Native American. Conservative figures say the Mestizo and Native American populations make up 87% of the populations and semi-Liberal figures say that the Native American population reaches upwards to 13% of the population plus the high percentage of Mestizo making El Salvador a highly Native American nation.\n\nThe history of El Salvador has been a struggle against many conquistadors, empires, dictatorships and world powers that would seal El Salvador's fate in the future. After gaining independence, several Spanish Creoles took control of the government and economy. El Salvador's population was further put into stress, turmoil, frustration, and ire which would condition a society with a cycle of a never ending violent nature. Feliciano Ama and Anastasio Aquino, king of the Nonoualquenos, led a rebellions against what was referred to as an abuse of power and corruption, but it was repressed by the government with genocide. These occurrences would also motivate Prudencia Ayala, Farabundo Martí and ultimately Óscar Romero.\nThis repression would have repercussions for the future of El Salvador. La matanza 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre, and all the liberation movements from the 1930s to 1980s, Salvadoran Civil War and even the current Mara (gang) phenomenon would emerge from the injustices committed by Spanish rule, Creoles, and other foreign power interventions.\n\nThe 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre occurred on January 22 of that year, in the western departments of El Salvador when a brief peasant-led rebellion was suppressed by the government, then led by Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. The Salvadoran army, being vastly superior in terms of weapons and soldiers, executed those who stood against it. The rebellion was a mixture of protest and insurrection and ended in ethnocide, claiming the lives of anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 peasants and other civilians, many of them indigenous people.\n\nThe Salvadoran Civil War was a conflict between the military-led government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), a coalition or \"umbrella organization\" of five left-wing guerrilla groups. A coup on October 15, 1979, led to the killings of anti-coup protesters by the government as well as anti-disorder protesters by the guerrillas, and is widely seen as the tipping point toward civil war. The full-fledged civil war lasted for more than 12 years and saw extreme violence from both sides. It also included the deliberate terrorizing and targeting of civilians by death squads, recruitment of child soldiers and other violations of human rights, mostly by the military. An unknown number of people disappeared during the conflict, and the UN reports that more than 75,000 were killed.\n\nOn top of the recurring natural disasters such as massive destructive earthquakes, cyclonic systems and volcanic activity, the constant war atmosphere in El Salvador including the prehistoric wars in Mesoamerica times the colonization of the Spaniards, the independence wars, the oppression of later ruthless dictatorships, the 1932 indigenous massacre, the Central American proxy wars in the 70's, the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980s and the current gang war, have all put a heavy hinder-age in the development of El Salvador and left the Salvadoran society vulnerable and prone to interpersonal violence\n\nThe exodus of Salvadorans was a result of both economic and political problems. The largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s, in which 20%-30% of El Salvador's population emigrated. About 50% percent, or up to 500,000 of those who escaped the country headed to the U.S., which was already home to over 10,000 Salvadorans. The number of Salvadoran immigrants in the United States continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters that hit El Salvador, including earthquakes and hurricanes. Gang warfare, which made El Salvador one of the dangerous countries in the world, also contributed to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum in the late part of the 2000s and the first four years in the 2010 decade, by 2008, there were about 1.1 million Salvadoran immigrants in the United States.\n\nEl Salvador has the largest population density in Latin America, and is the third most populated country in Central America after Honduras and Guatemala, from the 2005 census, the population exceeds 6 million. The total impact of civil wars, dictatorships and socioeconomics drove over a million Salvadorans (both as immigrants and refugees) into the United States; Guatemala is the second country that hosts more Salvadorans behind the United States, approximately 110,000 Salvadorans according to the national census of 2010. in addition small Salvadoran communities sprung up in Canada, Australia, Belize, Panama, Costa Rica, Italy, and Sweden since the migration trend began in the early 1970s. The 2010 U.S. Census counted 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, up from 655,165 in 2000. By 2017, the figured had risen to over 2.3 million.\n\nEl Salvador's population numbers 6,377,358. Ethnically, 86.3% of Salvadorans are mixed (mixed Indigenous Native American and European Spanish origin). Another 12.7% is of pure European descent, other 0.23% are pure Native American indigenous descent, 0.13% black people and others 0.64%.\n\n86.3% of the population are mestizo, having mixed Native American indigenous and European ancestry. In the mestizo population, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Afro-Salvadoran, and the Native American people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages or have and indigenous culture, all identify themselves as being culturally mestizo.\n\nAccording to the Salvadoran Government, about 0.23% of the population are of full indigenous origin. The largest most dominant Native American groups in El Salvador are the Lenca people, Cacaopera people, Maya peoples: (Poqomam people/Chorti people) and Pipil people. However the small culture enclaves of Xinca people, Alaguilac people, Mixe people, Mangue language people became extinct through the Mestizo process, the country also had an Olmec past. (Pipil, located in the west and central part of the country, and Lenca, found east of the Lempa River). There are small populations of Cacaopera people in the Morazán Department and a few Ch'orti' people live in the department of Ahuachapán, near the border of Guatemala.\n\nThe number of indigenous people in El Salvador have been criticized by indigenous organizations and academics as too small and accuse the government of denying the existence of indigenous Salvadorans in the country. Nonetheless, very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant Mestizo/Spanish culture. The low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by historically high rates of old-world diseases, absorption into the mestizo population, as well as mass murder during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising (or \"La Matanza\") which saw (estimates of) up to 30,000 peasants killed in a short period of time. Many authors note that since \"La Matanza\" the indigenous in El Salvador have been very reluctant to describe themselves as such (in census declarations for example) or to wear indigenous dress or be seen to be taking part in any cultural activities or customs that might be understood as indigenous. Departments and cities in the country with notable indigenous populations include Sonsonate (especially Izalco, Nahuizalco, and Santo Domingo), Cacaopera, and Panchimalco, in the department of San Salvador.\n\nSome 12.7% of Salvadorans are white. This population is mostly made up of ethnically Spanish people, while there are also Salvadorans of French, German, Swiss, English, Irish, and Italian descent. In northern departments like the Chalatenango Department, it is well known that residents in the area are of pure Spanish descent; The governor of San Salvador, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, ordered families from northern Spain (Galicia and Asturias) to settle the area to compensate for the lack of indigenous people to work the land; it is not uncommon to see people with blond hair, fair skin, and blue or green eyes in municipalities like Dulce Nombre de María, La Palma, and El Pital.\n\nThere is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000); mostly from Palestine (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of Lebanese descent is around 25,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey.\n\nPardo is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. Afro-Salvadorans are the descendants of the African population that were enslaved and shipped to El Salvador to work in mines in specific regions of El Salvador. They have mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. Thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America. A total of only 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have English Antillean (West Indian) or Garifuna populations of the Caribbean, but instead had older colonial African slaves that came straight from Africa. This is the reason why El Salvador is the only country in Central America not to have a caribbeanized culture, and instead preserved its classical Central America culture.\n\nIn the 2007 census, 0.7% of the population was considered as \"other\".\nThere are up to 100,000 Nicaraguans living in El Salvador.\n\nSpanish is the language spoken by virtually all inhabitants.\nSpanish (official), Salvadoran Sign Language, Pipil (Nawat) , Kekchí. Immigrant languages include Chinese, Arabic, Poqomam, and American Sign Language.\n\nThere is diversity of religious beliefs in El Salvador. The majority of the population is Christian. Roman Catholics (47%) and Evangelicals (33%) are the two major denominations in the country. Those not affiliated with any religious group amount to 17% of the population. The remainder of the population (3%) is made up of Jehovah's Witnesses, Hare Krishnas, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Latter-day Saints, and those adhering to indigenous religious beliefs.\n\nMestizo culture dominates the country, heavy in both Native American Indigenous and European Spanish influences. A new composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the native Mesoamerican population of Cuzcatlan with the European settlers. The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture. Archbishop Óscar Romero is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War. Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the Jesuit priests and professors Ignacio Ellacuría, Ignacio Martín-Baró, and Segundo Montes, who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war.\n\nPainting, ceramics and textiles are the principal manual artistic mediums. Writers Francisco Gavidia (1863–1955), Salarrué (Salvador Salazar Arrué) (1899–1975), Claudia Lars, Alfredo Espino, Pedro Geoffroy Rivas, Manlio Argueta, José Roberto Cea, and poet Roque Dalton are among the most important writers from El Salvador. Notable 20th-century personages include the late filmmaker Baltasar Polio, female film director Patricia Chica, artist Fernando Llort, and caricaturist Toño Salazar.\n\nAmongst the more renowned representatives of the graphic arts are the painters Augusto Crespin, Noe Canjura, Carlos Cañas, Giovanni Gil, Julia Díaz, Mauricio Mejia, Maria Elena Palomo de Mejia, Camilo Minero, Ricardo Carbonell, Roberto Huezo, Miguel Angel Cerna, (the painter and writer better known as MACLo), Esael Araujo, and many others.

{"id": "3567974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3567974", "title": "Samuel Provance", "text": "Samuel Provance\n\nSamuel Provance is a former U.S. Army military intelligence sergeant, known for disobeying an order from his commanders in the 302nd Military Intelligence Battalion by discussing with the media his experiences at the Abu Ghraib Prison, where he was assigned from September 2003 to February 2004. After being disciplined for his actions, he eventually brought his case to the United States Government in February 2006, resulting in a Congressional subpoena of the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The main points of his testimony are that military intelligence soldiers and contracted civilian interrogators had abused detainees, that they directed the military police to abuse detainees, the extent of this knowledge at the prison, and the subsequent cover-up of these practices when investigated.\n\nMilitary intelligence soldiers from the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade, with firsthand knowledge, had in fact spoken with the media weeks before Provance did, which corroborate his claims, saying they wanted to \"do what's right ... get the truth out,\" but they chose to remain anonymous, \"because of concern that their military careers would be ruined.\" In addition, the military police themselves said they were ordered and encouraged by interrogators to treat detainees harshly, to \"soften\" them up for interrogations, and were commended by their commander for doing so.\n\nProvance was assigned to Abu Ghraib prison (also known as the Baghdad Correctional Facility) shortly after a mortar attack at the prison killed and wounded several soldiers from his unit on September 20, 2003. Though an intelligence analyst supporting the V Corps during the initial phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom, under the command of General William S. Wallace, at Abu Ghraib he supervised the systems administration on the so-called \"infamous\" night shift, under the command of Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez.\n\nIn January 2004, the same month that saw the unexplained death of his Command Sergeant Major Stacy Adams, Provance was interviewed by a US Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) agent, as part of Major General Antonio M. Taguba's investigation of Abu Ghraib. Taguba considered Provance a witness based on his sworn statement. His name, along with other witnesses, were made known in May 2004 when the classified Taguba Report was deliberately leaked to the public.\n\nProvance was also interviewed by Major General George Fay, the lead investigator of a second major investigation of Abu Ghraib. Provance later claimed Fay was more interested in the military police in the photographs, not of intelligence operations (Fay was charged with investigating military intelligence). He also claimed Fay resisted his testimony (largely the same provided to Taguba), who afterward decided to recommend charges of \"dereliction of duty\" against him for not coming forward any sooner, saying if he had, he could have prevented the scandal.\n\nProvance was then issued an order by his company commander, Captain Scott Hedberg, and subsequently his battalion commander, Lt. Colonel James Norwood, not to communicate with anyone about his experiences at Abu Ghraib. Perceiving the threat of charges and the gag order as part of a larger \"cover-up\", Provance spoke with the media, hoping they would investigate where the military was apparently failing to. His top secret security clearance was suspended and he was administratively \"flagged\" (a career hold) for 16 months, until he was given an Article 15 (non-judicial punishment). This began with the May 18, 2004 broadcast of ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, where he said, \"there's definitely a cover-up...people are either telling themselves or being told to be quiet...many people are probably hiding and wishing to God that this storm passes without them having to be investigated [or] personally looked at\". According to the Stars and Stripes, Provance, \"still speaks passionately about his dedication to the Army and condemns the few leaders above him\". Provance told them, \"I would never speak out against the Army, that's not what I'm doing...the Army is an awesome organization that I respect and honor...it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out\".\n\nOn May 26, 2004 former Vice President Al Gore referred to Provance during a speech at New York University, as the Abu Ghraib scandal evolved into a heated political debate, with the Presidential election coming up that November.\n\nIn June 2004, Jerry Fleishman wrote a profile of Provance for the Los Angeles Times. \"Provance speaks in a near-whisper, but he possesses a steely defiant streak\". It was reported that he studied to be a Christian Pastor at Holmes College of the Bible in Greenville, South Carolina, \"quitting...after raising too many questions about faith and fundamentalism\". He then joined the US Army, enlisting in Air Defense Artillery, later tried out for Special Forces, and then reclassified into Military Intelligence. Despite his circumstances as a result of the Abu Ghraib investigations and scandal, \"he reveres the spirit of the combat soldier\", and worried that this was now in jeopardy. The German newspaper Tageszeitung also wrote a profile.\n\nOn July 5, 2004 the German news program \"Report Mainz\" broadcast an interview with Provance, where he revealed that children were detained at Abu Ghraib. In response, the Norwegian government joined the Red Cross and Amnesty International in protest.\n\nJon Ronson published the book The Men Who Stare at Goats, later made into a motion picture in 2009. Provance, under the name \"Joseph Curtis\" to protect his identity at that time, is in a chapter named \"The Haunted Hotel\".\n\nTelevision's Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), as a part of its documentary program, Frontline (U.S. TV series), features Provance's perspective in the documentary \"The Torture Question\", in October 2005.\n\nIn September 2004, Provance was sent to Washington D.C. to speak with Senate Armed Services Committee staff, in preparation for a Congressional hearing of Major General Fay's investigation. It has not been made public what happened during these meetings or why they were held.\n\nIn February 2006, Provance testified before Congress alongside Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer (intelligence officer) from the US Army, Michael German from the FBI, and Russell D. Tice from the NSA. He testified that at his Article 15 proceeding in July 2005, he was threatened with up to ten years in military prison if he did not accept the terms of punishment. He accepted the terms, and for \"disobeying a lawful order\", he was demoted in rank. He also testified about many other things before unknown or not as detailed. Congressman Chris Shays (R-CT), the committee chairman, said to Provance, \"I just want to say to you it takes a tremendous amount of courage with your rank to tell a General what they may not want to hear, and people like you will help move our country in the right direction. And so this full committee thanks you for what you have done.\"\n\nIn July 2006, Provance's interview with Report Mainz was selected among other news stories in its forty-year broadcasting history for recognition. He gave an update on that television event.\n\nOn July 6, 2006 the New York Times reported that the House Committee on Government Reform issued a subpoena to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld because he had not responded to a March 7, 2006 request for information regarding Provance's demotion and testimony. Four months later, Rumsfeld resigned, citing Abu Ghraib as his \"darkest hour\", and ignored the subpoena.\n\nProvance was honorably discharged from the United States Army in October 2006 in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nIn November 2006, Provance spoke to a group of 350 people in Maplewood, New Jersey and received a certificate of appreciation.\n\nIn February 2007, Provance appeared in a HBO documentary, \"Ghosts of Abu Ghraib\", where he describes the prison as, \"\"Apocalypse Now\" meets \"The Shining\".\" An extended interview is included in the DVD release. He later wrote an article about his experience at a screening of the film in Washington DC, criticizing Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who had also been in attendance for a post-screening discussion with Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), for changing his opinions of Abu Ghraib since he'd been in contact with him.\n\nTara McKelvey published the book, \"Monstering: Inside America's Policy of Secret Interrogations and Torture in the Terror War\", which includes Provance's story most in-depth. She describes him as, \"unconventional...a keen sense of injustice\". The New York Times, in a book review, reported, \"if the United States still has a chance of winning the battle for the hearts and minds of the Muslim world, then we have people like Provance to thank\".\n\nOn September 20, 2007 Provance was given the Sam Adams Award for \"integrity in intelligence\" at the American University. He described missing the Army \"more than anything else\", and that after having lost his friends and family, speaking to the media was not worth it on a personal level.\n\nAn interview with Provance was broadcast on the Democracy Now! television program with Amy Goodman. He lamented that \"even to this day...there's been nobody else that has had their conscience bother them to come forward and say, look, this is what was really going on, and that it wasn't just these MP's, and that these MP's were really doing what they were told\".\n\nProvance wrote a critical editorial about the documentary, \"Standard Operating Procedure\", directed by Oscar-winning director Errol Morris. He claims Morris promised, \"a no-holds-barred documentary\", but instead only \"focuses on the awful photos, the people in them and those who took them\". Portions of his interview with Morris, cut from the film's release, are however on the Blu-ray Disc edition's special features.\n\nProvance gave a radio interview for Chicago Public Radio; saying he wished he had exhausted more \"official channels\", but that it is speculation to say if that would have changed anything. He wanted to discuss things more with his leadership, but having reprimanded him for bizarre things like not doing their laundry or not washing vehicles with water they were rationing, he felt they could not be trusted. He wanted to testify on behalf of the military police at their trials, but like in Lynndie England's case, her lawyers were erroneously told he could not be found. He compared his plight to Serpico, but instead of meeting the same fate, says he still loves being a soldier and could return to the Army, though he fears his career would be sabotaged by \"higher-ups\" who might fear he has ulterior motives.\n\nOn October 22, 2009, Provance was given a letter of commendation signed by former President Jimmy Carter and 15,000 others, for his \"uncommon courage in defending the rule of law and standing up against torture\". In his acceptance of the letter, he responded, \"if and when we do the right thing, we may not ever know to what extent our words and actions are ever used by other people, or even God, but you can be sure that they will be\". Days later he was interviewed by Karen Kwiatkowski; his final words being, \"not to give up on the Army or our country...there are still good people doing good things\".\n\nOn May 7, 2013, the documentary, \"Doctors of the Darkside\"; \", produced and directed by Martha Davis, is dedicated, \"to Sam Provance and the courage to bear witness\", and is screened internationally to raise awareness of \"the critical role of physicians and psychologists in detainee torture\".\n\nOn September 10, 2013, photographer Jo Metson Scott published the book \"The Grey Line\"; \", which documents, \"the perspective of US and UK soldiers who have spoken out against the Iraq War\". Provance is featured on the front cover, and a synopsis of his story is in the book.\n"}

Living most of his life in North America, he played a key role in propagating Thelema across the continent.\n\nBorn the illegitimate son of a domestic servant and her employer in Tonbridge, Kent, Smith migrated to Canada in 1907, where he went through a variety of jobs and began reading about Western esotericism. Through Charles Stansfeld Jones he was introduced to the writings of Thelema's founder, Aleister Crowley. He subsequently joined Crowley's Thelemite order, the A∴A∴, and the Thelemite wing of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). In 1915, he joined the O.T.O.'s British Columbia Lodge No. 1, based in Vancouver, and rose to become one of its senior members.\n\nIn 1922 Smith moved to Los Angeles in the United States, where he, Jane Wolfe, and Regina Kahl tried to establish a new Thelemite community. They founded an incorporated Church of Thelema which gave weekly public performances of the Gnostic Mass from their home in Hollywood. Seeking to revive the inactive North American O.T.O., in 1935 Smith then founded the O.T.O. Agape Lodge, which subsequently relocated to Pasadena. He brought a number of prominent Thelemites into the O.T.O., including Jack Parsons and Grady Louis McMurtry, but he had a strained relationship with both Crowley and Crowley's North American deputy, Karl Germer, who eventually ousted him from his position as Agape Lodge leader, replacing him with Parsons. Smith retreated to Malibu, where he continued to practice Thelema until his death.\n\nSmith was born as Frank Wenham in Tonbridge, Kent, on 9 June 1885. He was the illegitimate son of Oswald Cox, a member of a prominent local family who resided at Marl Field House, and one of his domestic servants, Minnie Wenham, whom Frank would never come to know. Considered an embarrassment by the wealthy Cox family, from an early age he was sent away to live with relatives, and aged four sent to a boarding school where he was physically abused by staff before being removed from the institution by his paternal grandmother, who took him for a year in Switzerland. From 1899 to 1901, he studied at Bedales School, where he developed his lifelong hobby of book binding, before becoming the apprentice to a cabinet maker in Kendal until 1906.\n\nWith few ties in Britain, he decided to emigrate to Canada, arriving in Nova Scotia in 1907, where he gained work on a farm in Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1911 he worked at a confectioner's warehouse, and then for a further nine months at a logging camp, before gaining a job as an accounting clerk at the British Columbia Electric Railway in April 1912. He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it; instead he began reading about Eastern religion, yoga, and Western esotericism. While at work, he met Charles Stansfeld Jones, a Thelemite who shared Smith's interest in these subjects and who lent him copies of Aleister Crowley's \"Book 4\" and volume one, number one of \"The Equinox\". Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain-based magical order, the A∴A∴, in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including yoga and the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours.\n\nSmith entered into a relationship with a woman twenty years his senior, Emily Sophia \"Nem\" Talbot Smith, although it remains unclear whether they ever married. With Nem and her daughter Katherine, Smith moved into a specially-constructed house designed by the Thelemite architect Howard E. White. Located at 138 East 13th Street, North Vancouver, Smith converted the attic into a temple for Thelemic rituals.\n\nSmith also decided to join the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), an occult organisation whose British branch, the Mysteria Magica Maxima (MMM), was run by Crowley, who used it to promote Thelema. In January 1915, Smith signed up to the MMM, and in April went through the Minerval degree initiation at the British Columbia Lodge No. 1. In May, he took part in the Lodge's public performance of the Rites of Isis, which it was hoped would attract further members. In a private capacity, he meanwhile continued performing his A∴A∴ practices, and also began experimenting with the entheogenic properties of anhalonium. In October 1915, Crowley visited the Lodge, where he met with Smith. Soon after, Smith would be upgraded to the position of Master Magician within the Lodge, and in March 1916 received the Probationer level in the A∴A∴, adopting as his personal magical motto the Latin words \"Nubem Eripiam\" (\"I will snatch away the cloud\").\n\nSmith's relationship with Nem was strained, and he began an affair with his step-daughter, Katherine. In November 1916, the three of them tried to resign from the O.T.O. lodge so as to prevent their problems affecting the group. Their resignations were rejected, and by January 1917 they were once again active within the lodge. Nevertheless, in March the lodge shut down for 13 months, during which time Crowley and Jones scrutinised Smith's diaries to ascertain his magical progress. Katherine became pregnant with Smith's child, who was born in December 1917, and named Noel Talbot-Smith. Jones proclaimed that Noel represented \"the Crowned and Conquering Child\" prophecised in the main Thelemite holy book, \"The Book of the Law\". Jones was soon named O.T.O. Viceroy for Canada, and in April he re-initiated the lodge at Smith's home, with Smith himself being appointed the lodge's Right Worshipful Master. Jones himself claimed that he had undergone a \"Great Initiation\" and was now an Ipsissimus; his relationship with Crowley broke down, and he subsequently resigned from the O.T.O., deeply disappointing Smith.\n\nSmith meanwhile continued working towards the A∴A∴ grade of Zelator, while the British Columbia Lodge No. 1 became increasingly moribund following the death of White, a key member, who had succumbed to Spanish Flu aged 33 in November 1918. Jones had rejoined the O.T.O. and relocated to Detroit in the United States. When Smith was fired from his job following a bout of flu in February 1920, he decided to join Jones in Detroit, where there was a small O.T.O. community; there he gained work as a clerk with the Detroit City Gas Company. In his absence, Nem was appointed Right Worshipful Master of the Vancouver lodge. In March 1921, Jones and Smith proceeded to Chicago, but in June Smith returned to North Vancouver to see his family. That year, Jones convinced Smith to join an esoteric organisation known as the Universal Brotherhood (UB). Smith however was unnerved that rather than expressing a Thelemic viewpoint, the UB adhered to Roman Catholicism, and he also considered its literature purposeless, vague, and grandiose; he soon dropped out. Back in Vancouver, Smith aided one of his initiates, Frank Page, in founding the British Columbia Lodge No. 3 in Kamloops, creating all the furniture for their temple. Nevertheless, the lodge closed after a year, with Smith's own British Columbia Lodge No. 1 also becoming defunct in February 1922.\n\nUnable to find work in Vancouver, Smith headed to Los Angeles in California, United States. On the way he stopped at San Francisco, where he met with Cecil Frederick Russell, a Thelemite who had departed from the Crowleyan orthodoxy to found his own group, the Choronzon Club. Smith however disliked Russell, and later claimed that he had been unnerved when Russell began expressing a sexual interest in children. After settling in Los Angeles, Smith gained a job at the Southern California Gas Company, entered into a relationship with a woman named Ann Barry, and began attending occasional meetings of the United Lodge of Theosophists, an esoteric organisation centred in the city. Jones meanwhile had united Thelema with auto-suggestion to found his own group, the Psychomagian Society (PMS), and he appointed Smith to be its Local Recorder for Los Angeles; out of friendship to Jones, Smith did so, but was uninterested in the PMS' teachings. Through their correspondences, Crowley came to reject the PMS and relations between himself and Jones once again broke down, this time permanently. Smith retained much affection for Jones, whom he saw as his mentor and friend, but nevertheless agreed with Crowley over the PMS and also rejected Jones' ongoing fascination with the UB, which Smith considered incompatible with Thelema; their relationship too came to an end in 1926.\n\nNow based in Los Angeles, Smith applied for US citizenship but was rejected, due to the fact that in his application he had claimed to be married but he was unable to prove with paperwork. Seeking to promote Thelema in the city, he adopted his own student, Oliver Jacobi, whom he mentored in the A∴A∴ system, and in the autumn of 1927, he developed a close friendship with fellow Thelemite and Hollywood actress Jane Wolfe. Although he continued to have sexual relationships with other women, Smith retained his love for Katherine, who came to visit him in Los Angeles, where they were legally married on 24 August 1927 at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, the day before she returned to Montreal. She tried to get Smith to abandon occultism and Thelema and return to her in Canada, but he refused, leading her to file for divorce in May 1930, taking sole custody of their child. Smith continued to have sexual and romantic relationships with other women, and – influenced by Crowley's bisexuality – also experimented with same-sex sexual relations, but felt no attraction to men. From July to September 1929, a married woman named Leota Schneider moved in with Smith, and they had an affair, but she soon returned to her husband, while from July to December 1930, Smith began undertaking sex magic rituals with Wolfe, although their relationship remained platonic. Smith soon met Regina Kahl and her sister Leona \"Lee\" Watson, whom he initiated into the O.T.O. in early 1931, with Regina also joining the A∴A∴. Smith had sexual relations with both sisters, but while Regina – with whom his activity became sadomasochistic – became romantically attached to him, Lee soon abandoned Thelema.\n\nIn 1932, Crowley, now based back in England, fell seriously ill, and believing his death to be immanent, he sent Smith a testament proclaiming that in the event of his death, Smith would become Frater Superior and Outer Head of the Order (OHO) of the O.T.O.; he soon however recovered. In May of that year, Smith and Kahl began renting the large house at 1746 Winona Boulevard in Hollywood, and began to take in lodgers to help pay for it. Kahl and Wolfe began using the attic for Thelemic rituals, and in March 1933 they performed their first public Gnostic Mass in the room, hoping to attract interested persons to Thelema. Crowley was pleased with their progress, and asked them to raise funds so that he could afford to visit. The weekly performances of the Gnostic Mass began to attract increasingly large crowds, with their \"Crowley Nights\" attracting around 150 guests, among them the film star John Carradine. In April 1934, Smith incorporated the Church of Thelema under US law, although retained the North American O.T.O. as an unincorporated secret society. Crowley however was confused, and believed that Smith had incorporated the O.T.O., something which angered him; he subsequently complained about Smith in letters to other initiates. After an argument, Crowley and Smith ceased correspondence for a time. Smith also attempted to revive the largely defunct North American O.T.O., attracting 15 initial initiates, many of whom were dissatisfied members of the Choronzon Club, which was now in decline.\n\nWith the O.T.O. now being revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, and brought in 7 initiates to the Minerval level in September 1935. He advertised the foundation of his group through an advert in \"American Astrology\" magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was. The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, as well as social events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour of Wayne Walker, a proponent of New Thought who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing; they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness. Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.\n\nActivities picked up again when Kahl, who worked as a drama teacher, brought three of her interested students into the group, among them Phyllis Seckler, and other individuals also joined the group, among them Louis T. Culling and Roy Leffingwell. However, the rising number of members caused schisms and arguments, and the Lodge again ceased its private activities from March 1940 to March 1941. They returned to their activities to initiate a couple who had become interested in the O.T.O. through attending the Gnostic Mass, rocket scientist Jack Parsons and his wife Helen. Parsons became enamored with Thelema, although initially expressed both \"repulsion and attraction\" for Smith. Smith wrote to Crowley, claiming that Parsons was \"a really excellent man ... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself ... JP is going to be very valuable\". The Parsons would help bring new members into the group; Grady McMurtry and his fiancee Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister Sara Northrup. In February 1939 a young college student who had attended the mass, Ayna Sosoyena, was murdered; although police drew no connection to the Lodge, sensationalist local tabloids connected the two, although were unaware that the Lodge was involved with Crowley or Thelema. A sympathetic local radio reporter allowed Smith to explain the purpose of the Mass to allay fears of the group, but the interview was never aired in an agreement with local press that they would drop the story.\n\nBy this point, the Agape Lodge was fully operational once more, although Crowley had remained highly critical of Smith, believing that he was failing to raise sufficient funds for Crowley's personal use. He appointed Karl Germer, a German Thelemite recently arrived in the US, to be his representative on the continent, and instructed Germer to oversee the payment of dues to himself. He also specified that it would now be Germer, and not Smith, who was his chosen successor. Attempting to placate Crowley, in December 1941 Smith stated that all Lodge members now had to contribute 5% of their earnings as an \"Emergency Fee\" that went to Crowley. Crowley's criticisms nevertheless continued, and Smith suffered a mild heart attack, retiring prematurely from work at the age of 56 before undergoing an operation to remove haemorroids in February 1942.\n\nSmith decided to relocate Agape Lodge to a larger premises, renting the large house at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena from June 1942 for $100 a month, moving many of the lodge members into the house, living as a form of commune and raising livestock and vegetables in the grounds. Parsons had begun a relationship with Sara Northrup, while Smith consoled Helen, who would become his partner for the rest of his life; nevertheless the four remained friends. Although they had ceased to publicly perform the Gnostic Mass, membership of the lodge continued to grow. A number of prominent members however left, among them Regina Kahl and Phyllis Seckler. Soon, both the FBI and the Pasadena police department began to investigate the O.T.O. and Agape Lodge, particularly as Germer, now leader of the North American O.T.O., was German; ultimately, they decided that the group was no threat to national security, describing it as a probable \"love cult\". Crowley however had remained highly critical of Smith's leadership of the lodge, and ordered Wolfe to send him on a personal magical retreat; she felt conflicted, but eventually conceded to Crowley's demands. Both Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith ousted permanently, believing that he had become a bad influence on the other lodge members; many of the members, including Jack and Helen Parsons, wrote to them to defend their mentor, but Germer nevertheless ordered him to stand down, with Parsons appointed head of the lodge.\n\nIn April Helen gave birth to Smith's son, who was named Kwan Lanval Parsons. In May, Smith and Helen left for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley with their baby, where Smith undertook his magical retirement. Back in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith's birth chart, and came to the conclusion that he was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him; Smith however remained sceptical. Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O., while Parsons – who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict – ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head. In a letter informing Crowley of this decision, Smith remarked \"Would to God you knew your people better.\" Germer subsequently appointed Max Schneider head of the Agape Lodge, which remained inactive, while Crowley, Germer, and Schneider began spreading lies about Smith, including that he was responsible for raping initiates, claims that were denied by many Lodge members.\n\nIn September 1944 Smith went on a second magical retirement, during which he performed pranayama and the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram, invoked Thoth, and recited the Holy Books of Thelema from memory. During the retreat he learned that Kahl, his former lover, had died, which greatly upset him. Returning to his Pasadena home, he was welcomed by Parsons, but Crowley insisted that Smith be shunned by the lodge members, and so he moved back to Hollywood. Increasingly alienated by Crowley's attitude, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. in August 1946. Now renting a house, Smith sought out various handyman jobs, when he learned that Crowley had died and been succeeded as OHO of the O.T.O. by Germer. He became good friends with the art dealer Baron Ernst von Harringa, who commissioned Smith to construct Asian-style furniture for his gallery. Smith's own health was deteriorating, and in 1948 he suffered from a number of mild heart attacks. He nevertheless continued to believe in Thelema, and hoped to revive the Church of Thelema through performing the Gnostic Mass once more. Following Parsons' death in an explosion – which Smith suspected was a case of suicide – Smith was invited to perform the Gnostic Mass in his memory.\n\nAlthough they had long disliked each other, Germer recognised that Smith was the only living individual with a good practical knowledge of the O.T.O. degree system, and so put him in contact with Kenneth Grant, who was then trying to revive the O.T.O. in London. Smith and Germer would only meet in person for the first time in June 1956, when the latter was visiting California, and soon after Germer introduced him to young Brazilian Thelemite Marcelo Ramos Motta, who would later grow to despise Smith. Smith purchased a plot of land in Malibu where he built his own house for himself, Helen, and their son, which he named \"Hoc Id Est\" (\"This Is It\"). Construction was interrupted in February 1955 when he underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate. This developed into prostate cancer, and mistrusting of conventional medicine, he sought out an alternative treatment at the Hoxsey Clinic in Dallas, Texas, which he visited in December 1956, but they were unable to help him. Smith died as a result of the disease at home on 27 April 1957, subsequently being cremated at the Grandview Memorial Park in Glendale.\n\n\"The Unknown God\" was reviewed by Robert Ellwood of the University of Southern California for the peer-reviewed journal \"\". Ellwood described it as \"the definitive work on American Crowleyanity\", noting that it was the product of 15 years of \"careful and documented\" research. He praised \"Starr's lucid style and the inherent fascination of the material, replete with vivid characters, epic rows, and sexual intrigue\".\n"}

In 2002, upon his arrival, Zhu announced that he and literature had divorced, he thought that he could't get rid of the solitariness and desperation by literature. After that, Zhu turned into a scholar, a critic. He intervened in the field of cultural criticism, using a completely new style of writing.

As a representative of the young generation in the end of last century, Zhu thought extensively and deeply about the possibility of the existence of culture, inspiring the young readers’ thoughts on some fundamental issues concerning culture and education.\n\n(逃亡者档案). The author is Zhu Dake, this book was published in 1999, (學林出版社), In the field of culture Criticism, Zhu Dake has his own style, that is always creating something new and original. In this book, there are 5 parts. He tried to expose the cultural maze by sharp language. He try his best to find real history by his wisdom, when he faced all kinds of cultural phenomena. He confidently came to the front, pointing the mistakes and correcting it. He claimed that there was something behind the truth. He declared:”I want to try”. This book makes us reflect and let us think about the problems of that ear.\n\nLiumang (流氓) is a word meaning the rovers who have an anxious state of mind and who take a position of social rebellion. In this book, Zhu Dake divides Chinese society into the orthodox society and the Liumang’s society where order, faith, authority and ethics don't exist. Examining three aspects, cool words (酷语), sexy words (色语) and abusive words (秽语), Zhu Dake researches, analyzes and elucidates thoroughly the existence of Liumang in all kinds of cultural forms, such as novels, poetry, art, music, etc. Zhu Dake reveals the features of Liumang in a vivid way because in this book, there are a great many of illustrations, including portraits, photos, posters, and paintings. Wei Yingjie (魏英杰), a famous Chinese writer and commentator, said that this book is a sort of history of modern Chinese culture. Before the publication of this book in November 2006, some passages had been published in many newspapers, for example, Dongfang Daily ().\n\nReview of the 21st Century Chinese Culture, issued under Zhu Dake and Zhang Hong’s (张闳, culture critic and essayist) general editorship and published by Guangxi Normal University Press from 2003 to 2008, is an annual presentation of the cultural achievement of Mainland China. There are 7 volumes up to now. It includes the essence of documents on cultural criticism of the year, popular key words and their explanations, lists of cultural events of the year and so on. To highlight the spirit of humanist culture, the book was edited from with a unique stand and the spirit of criticism as the coordinate system of \"culture map\": \"cultural events\" as its meridians to show the important events of different cultural domains, \"key words\" as its parallels to penetratingly explain the key words in the public cultural space, plus \"critical literary selections\" to note the annual high mental standard of culture criticism.\n\nIn terms of the graphic design, the book is always simple and plain, while every article in it is extremely exclusive and trenchant.\n\nThe majority of the theses of cultural criticism that the editors selected, are fruits of folk language. They demonstrate the general popular state of narration through text and maintained the original creation of the language and different critics’ unique styles.\n\nThe two editors took a more popular stand and more inclined to free individuals. They strove to break through the style of traditional yearbooks to present a more open state with more perspectives and tightly trace the flowing deformation and the future trend of Chinese culture. It is a significant \"memorandum book\" to learn local practices and customs.\n\n"}
