{"id": "10330721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10330721", "title": "Abu al-Walid", "text": "Abu al-Walid\n\nAbu al-Walid () (also transliterated as Abu al-Waleed and also called Abu al-Walid al-Ghamdi or simply Abu Walid) (1967 – 16 April 2004), was a Saudi Arabian of the Ghamd tribe who fought as a \"mujahid\" volunteer in Central Asia, the Balkans, and the North Caucasus. He was killed in April 2004 in Chechnya by the Russian federal forces.\n\nAl-Walid was one of the most prominent Arabs fighting in Chechnya. In 2002 he took over as emir (commander) of an autonomous unit, composed mostly of non-Chechen mujahideen, following the death of Ibn al-Khattab on 20 March 2002.\n\nAbu al-Walid was accused by Russians of terrorist attacks on civilians, and alleged to be an agent of Saudi intelligence, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Bin Laden's al-Qaeda. He never responded to the charges, but condemned abuses by Russian forces in Chechnya.\n\nDuring his lifetime, al-Walid stayed out of the spotlight. His predecessor, Ibn al-Khattab (more commonly known as Khattab), was known to have a personal camera crew of two who followed him into combat. Speculation arose about al-Walid's identity, whereabouts and actions, and occasionally there were rumours of his death. A persistent rumour was that he had drowned in June 2002, carried off on his horse after trying to ford a river. Russian officials announced his death at least seven times. and at one point, even his very existence was deemed doubtful.\n\nOn 23 June 2002, his family gave an interview to the Saudi newspaper \"Al-Watan\", telling much about his background. They said his full given name was Abd Al-Aziz Bin Ali Bin Said Al Said Al-Ghamdi.\n\nAl-Walid was raised in the village of al-Hal, near the city of Baljorashi in Saudi Arabia’s Al Bahah Province. In his native village, his father was a well known imam. The boy was born into a large family as one of eleven sons. His brothers claimed that in his youth, al-Walid had enjoyed acting, reading religious books and studying the Quran.\n\nIn 1986, when he was 16 years old, al-Walid obtained his parents' permission to participate in jihad in Afghanistan. He soon left for the country to join the mujahideen in their fight against the Russian forces during the Afghan-Soviet War. The next two years he spent training at the Maktab al-Khidamat, an organization created by Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden. They trained the international volunteers and distributed funds to Islamic groups. Upon completing his training, al-Walid was assigned to a combat unit where he started fighting. On two occasions he briefly returned to Saudi Arabia, once to have an injury to his left hand treated.\n\nAfter the end of the Afghan War, al-Walid went on to fight in other conflicts in Europe and Asia. In the 1990s, the movement would lead him to the Balkans, where he fought alongside the Bosnian Muslims in the Bosnian War; Tajikistan, where he assisted Muslim rebels in the Tajik Civil war; and eventually to Chechnya, where he joined the band called the Arab mujahideen. This group had been organized by and was being led by Ibn al-Khattab.\n\nIn the First Chechen War, al-Walid served as a Naib (deputy) in Khattab's unit. He participated in the numerous raids and ambushes that were executed by the IIB, including the April 1996 Shatoy ambush, in which they attacked and destroyed a large Russian armoured column.\n\nAfter the war, he remained in Chechnya along with most of the battalion It concentrated on setting up a network of camps in the mountainous South of the country, in which they trained Islamist rebels from throughout the region, and recruits from abroad.\n\nHe married a Chechen woman. They had two children together.\n\nOn 22 December 1997 al-Walid participated in a surprise attack on the base of the 136th Armoured Brigade of the Russian Army, stationed in Buynaksk, Dagestan. This raid contributed to the growing tensions between Moscow and the newly formed government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.\n\nIn 1999 he participated in the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade<nowiki>’s</nowiki> invasion of Dagestan, which helped catalyze the Second Chechen War. During this conflict, Khattab's first deputy Hakim al-Medani was killed. Analysts believe that after al-Medani's death, al-Walid was promoted to the position of first deputy. Before the events of 1999 in Dagestan, al-Walid was a relatively unknown figure outside of Chechnya.\n\nAfter his incursion, his notoriety began to rise in Islamist circles abroad.\n\nIn the Second Chechen War, al-Walid continued as Khattab’s deputy to participate in raids and ambushes. In the spring of 2000, he achieved his most important military victories. On 29 February, he led the Battle of Ulus-Kert. His forces engaged and surrounded an entire company of the VDV 76th Guards Air Assault Division from Pskov. The battle lasted for several days and eventually resulted in the total annihilation of the Russian company. The separatist news agency Chechenpress reported that only 12 Chechen rebels had been killed in the battle, while Russian sources estimated their losses at up to 300 men. In April 2000, al-Walid successfully attacked the VDV 51st Guards Parachute Landing Regiment from Tula.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, the late Aslan Maskhadov, then president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, appointed Abu al-Walid commander of the Eastern front.\n\nAfter Khattab’s death on 20 March 2002, al-Walid assumed command of the IIB. Soon afterwards he released an article through the foreign Mujahideen’s official website al-Qoqaz, in which he explained the circumstances surrounding Khattab’s death. The release of this article also confirmed that he had taken command of the IIB. Later he also issued a video-statement, in which he commented on the death of his predecessor.\n\nOn 9 April 2002, al-Walid announced that his forces had shot down the Mil Mi-24 ‘Hind’ gunship and taken its three-man crew prisoner. It had been reported missing for two months. He released the serial number of the helicopter and detailed information about the crew members. On 16 May he issued an ultimatum to the Russian military authorities: threatening to kill the three prisoners if the Russians failed to release 20 Chechens being held in Russian prisons. The Russians did not comply. The online Chechen Islamist news agency, Kavkaz Center, claimed it has unconfirmed information that the crew had been executed.\n\nAl-Walid was killed by members of Sulim Yamadaev’s Special Battalion “Vostok” (East) in Chechnya on 16 April 2004. Although there are several versions of the circumstances, the most extensive account is derived from a letter written by Abu Hafs al-Urduni, who assumed command of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya. He said that al-Walid was “on tour to all regiments to task them with operations and logistical plans.\" Members of his party were captured in the village of Tsa-Vedeno, and pro-Moscow security forces determined \"his position in a nearby forest.”\n\nAfter heavy bombardment of the area, snipers ambushed and killed al-Walid. Abu al-Walid's brother Ali Al Ghamdi said that Abu al-Walid was ambushed and shot by the Russian Special Forces in the forest near the village of Tsa-Vedeno. Ali said that Abu al-walid's companions were able to hide his body from the Russian forces in the forest then buried him later.\nHe also said that the information about Abu Al-Walid's being betrayed were wrong and that his brother was shot in a fight with the Russian forces.\nAbu al-Walid's will was not to be filmed after his death. Vladimir Putin rewarded Yamadaev as a Hero of the Russian Federation at the Kremlin in the summer of 2005.\n\nRussian authorities often accused Khattab, al-Walid and other Arabs fighting in Chechnya, of involvement in terrorism. According to the FSB, Al-Walid was responsible for several terrorist attacks, including the 1999 apartment bombings, the 2002 Kaspiysk bombing, and planned but never executed bacteriological attacks on Russia. He and Shamil Basayev were also accused of organizing the suicide-bombing of the Chechen Republic's Government headquarters in Grozny on 27 December 2002.\n\nOnly Basayev claimed responsibility for the latter attack, but Russian officials asserted that the “Arab methods” suggested that it was done by “Arab militants trained in Afghanistan”. Al-Walid has been accused of being an agent of al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Saudi Intelligence. He never responded to such allegations, and never claimed responsibility for any of these terrorist attacks. He never admitted to being a member of al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Saudi Intelligence.\n\nAl-Walid did comment on other acts of terrorism. On 11 June 2003, the London-based Arabic newspaper \"Asharq Al-Awsat\" reported on a statement he had released through the al-Qoqaz News Agency. He encouraged the Iraqi insurgents to carry out suicide operations. He was quoted as saying; “According to [my] experience in the Caucasus, such operations will have an effect on American and British troops.”\n\nOn 19 November 2003, the Qatar-based Arabic television network Al-Jazeera broadcast a video statement in which al-Walid commented on suicide bombings by Chechen women; he claimed the attacks were motivated by fear of rape and brutality by Russian soldiers. A translation of this statement is available on BBC Monitoring; he was quoted as saying; “These women, particularly the wives of the Mujahideen who were martyred, are being threatened in their homes, their honour and everything are being threatened. They do not accept being humiliated and living under occupation. They say that they want to serve the cause of Almighty God and avenge the death of their husbands and persecuted people.”\n\nOn 13 March 2004, one day before the Russian presidential election, al-Walid released another video statement broadcast by Al-Jazeera. He commented on the Russian strategy of dropping mines in the forested areas from which the Chechen insurgents are carrying out their guerrilla war against the Federal Armed Forces and their Chechen collaborators. He was quoted as saying the following;\n\n“The enemies of God drop mines in the forests and God willing, we will return them to the Russians and they will find them on their land and in the midst of their families. (…) But perhaps we may wait a little to see the upcoming elections. If they elect someone who declares war on Chechnya, then the Russians are declaring war against the Chechens and by God we will send them these [mines]... Not only these but also things that did not cross their minds. (…) We will return these to you [Russians]… You will, God willing, see hundreds of people crippled.” It is not known whether or not these threats have ever been carried out.\n\nThe Amirs of the Arab mujahideen in Chechnya have helped acquire and distribute funds provided by wealthy, Salafist charities, such as al-Haramein. But there has not been solid evidence of links to al-Qaeda or other international terrorist organizations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Of the 50 weapons he designed, the best known is the Suomi M-31 SMG. Other well-known weapon designs of his include the Lahti-Saloranta M/26 LMG, Lahti L-35 pistol, and Lahti L-39 anti-tank rifle. Lahti also designed the 7,62 ITKK 31 VKT anti-aircraft machine gun and the 20 ITK 40 VKT anti-aircraft cannon.\n\nHis work is considered decisive in defending Finnish independence and increasing trust in the reliability of domestic weapons produced there.\n\nAimo Johannes Lahti was born in Viiala on 28 April 1896, to Evert Williamson Lahti and Ida Sophia Carlsdaughter née Viitanen, the oldest of five boys. He had a safe and somewhat wild childhood. Lahti did not enjoy school and left after the sixth year of elementary school. He started working in the Viiala glass factory when he was 13 years old. In the same year, he bought his first weapon, a Berdan rifle, with five marks he had earned in the factory. Lahti was fascinated by the rifle’s mechanism and visited local gunsmith \"Säteri\" with whom he examined the weapon closely. Aimo Lahti visited him several times, becoming familiar with weapon mechanisms. Lahti served his conscription in central Finland’s regiment during 1918 and 1919. On October 20, 1919, he married Ida Dagmar Lassila (1 December 1890 – 27 October 1968) with whom he had a son, Olavi Johannes Lahti. Olavi was later a pilot in the Finnish Air Force and died in 1944.\n\nAfter working for the railway Aimo Lahti joined the Finnish Army as a Master Armorer in 1921. He was influenced in this decision by Captain Rosenholm. In 1922, he started to design the Suomi M-31 SMG after examining the Bergmann MP18, which had many design problems and was expensive. The new design was revolutionary because the reliability, accuracy, and rate of fire were excellent. The first 200 Suomi SMGs were produced in 1922. After the prototypes were made, he was ordered to work under the control of the Ministry of Defence and to design a light machine gun, which eventually would be the Lahti-Saloranta M/26. He then improved the Mosin–Nagant rifle by designing the M/27 \"Pystykorva\" \"Spitz\", named for its foresight guards' resemblance to the dog breed's ears. This rifle was later issued to the Finnish Army as their service rifle.\n\nIn 1932 Lahti and the Ministry of Defence signed two important agreements about Lahti's earnings and other economic benefits. It also gave the government rights to use and sell his designs. In the same year, he got an offer to move to an American weapon company. He was offered a check for 3 million marks and a five percent commission on the weapons that would have been produced in the United States. On the same day the Ministry reformed his older contract. Lahti received more benefits and rights to his inventions and therefore did not feel that moving to the United States was a better offer.\n\nLahti continued to design weapons until the end of the Continuation War when the Allied Control Commission questioned him about the lost 30 \"assault rifles\" that he was designing and other topics. The commission made a decision that he would not be allowed to work as a weapon designer anymore. He enjoyed a Finnish Army’s Major General’s pension after the age of 50, until his death in 1970 in Jyväskylä at the age of 74.\n\n\n"}

His younger brother was Jakov Nenadović, the first Serbian Interior Minister and voivode (military commander) in the First Serbian Uprising. His sons were Sima Nenadović who was a Serbian voivode in the Second Serbian Uprising and Matija Nenadović a Serbian archpriest, writer, and a notable leader of the First Serbian Uprising.\n\nAleksa Nenadović had business relations with Hadži Mustafa Pasha who was a vizier of the Belgrade Pashaluk. He also cooperated with Peter Ichko who saved his life once. In the summer of 1797 sultan appointed Mustafa Pasha on position of beglerbeg of Rumelia Eyalet and he left Serbia for Plovdiv to fight against Pazvantoğlu.

{"id": "18950650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18950650", "title": "Baldrick", "text": "Baldrick\n\nBaldrick is the name of several fictional characters featured in the long-running BBC historic comedy television series \"Blackadder\". Each one serves as Edmund Blackadder's servant and sidekick and acts as a foil to the lead character. Each series of \"Blackadder\" is set in a different period in British history, and each Baldrick character (as with the character of Edmund) is a descendant of the Baldrick from the preceding series. Just as Blackadder exists in many incarnations throughout the ages, so does Baldrick; whenever there is a Blackadder there is a Baldrick serving him. They are all portrayed by Sir Tony Robinson (although in the unaired pilot episode he was played by Philip Fox).\n\nThe relationship between Edmund and Baldrick evolves significantly; in the first series of the show, Baldrick is more intelligent than Blackadder, but this dynamic is reversed in subsequent series, with Baldrick's intelligence decreasing as the show continued. He is the only character other than Edmund Blackadder to appear in every episode of the programme.\n\n'Baldrick' is a real but rare family name. It is Germanic in origin, and has been present in Britain all the way back to the Norman Conquest of 1066.\n\nThe character of Baldrick has become popularly associated with the comedic catch phrase \"I have a cunning plan\". The \"cunning plans\" in question are dreamed up by Baldrick as a solution to a particular problem or crisis and are usually ridiculed scathingly by Blackadder for their implausibility, but Blackadder frequently resorts to using these plans when the situation becomes desperate.\n\nAlthough Baldrick's main goal is mostly very hidden, with a clever eye it is seen that he makes several attempts throughout history to raise his social standing, similar to Blackadder although the latter had much more success.\n\nThe catchphrase \"I have a cunning plan\" made its first appearance in the pilot episode, but it is not regularly used until the third series; Blackadder had mentioned the phrase twice in the first series and Baldrick once. Baldrick had also claimed to have \"a plan\" in a \"cunning\" voice on one occasion in \"Blackadder II\". In the final episode of the last series, \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", Baldrick announces that he has a cunning plan to save the main characters from \"going over the top\", although it is never revealed what this plan might be (other than that it is \"as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University\"). Blackadder, perhaps realising he cannot postpone going into battle (and certain death) indefinitely, dismisses it, telling Baldrick \"Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than my plan to get out of here by pretending to be mad. I mean, who would have noticed another madman around here?\"\n\nA persistent feature among the Baldricks is their lack of sexual preference, which is often played upon for comic effect. Although Baldrick likes women, he sometimes ends up having encounters with other men, such as a sailor in \"Money\" (\"Blackadder II\") in exchange for sixpence and Will Scarlet (\"\"). He also expresses interest in marrying male characters to increase his social status, such as Blackadder in \"Bells\", Prince George in \"Amy and Amiability\" (\"Blackadder the Third\") and General Melchett in \"Major Star\" (\"Blackadder Goes Forth\"). Nonetheless, Baldrick also shows a degree of attraction to women, shown in his conversation with a prostitute in \"Money\", and in \"Amy and Amiability\", when he expresses disappointment upon receiving a perfunctory kiss from Blackadder (instead of the voluptuous Lady Sarah Cheapside). Each Baldrick, at various points over the four series, is also willing—and at times eager—to indulge in crossdressing.\n\nThe only trait that is actually shared by all Baldricks is complete lack of hygiene and always having filthy, shaggy clothing. All Baldricks also have a different hat in the series (the first one has a Phrygian cap, the second has a Tudor bonnet, the third has a tricorne hat and the fourth has a Lenin-inspired trench cap). Some Baldricks are also fascinated with turnips, although mainly the third one. The second Baldrick mainly cooked it for dinner and while also finding an amusingly shaped turnip funny while the fourth was in a \"Turnip Street Workhouse\". However, only the third Baldrick had no other goal in life but the acquisition of turnips. Baldrick proves more intelligent than Blackadder's other companions—such as Lord Percy Percy or George—although only slightly. He is, however, often accorded more cruelty and mistreatment than he deserves.\n\nIn 1982, prior to the first \"Black Adder\" series, a pilot episode was filmed which featured a number of characters who were later included in the first series. The episode, which was never televised, included an early version of the Baldrick character, played by Philip Fox, who is portrayed as slightly stupid in contrast to the intelligent, scheming Prince Edmund. Following this pilot, the writers decided to reverse this relationship when the first televised series was produced, so that Baldrick was the clever foil to the idiotic Edmund. In 2010, \"The Guardian\" reflected on this change in characterisation, suggesting that it had been a poor decision and commenting that it was \"an interesting example of getting it right first time\":\n\nThe medieval Baldrick was probably the only Baldrick of the four who could really be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had worked very hard to get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and mucking out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with Lord Percy, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.\n\nAlthough cleverer than the Prince, Baldrick, knowing his place in the medieval pecking-order, holds him in awe. He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with illusions of grandeur, and often ends up doing his dirty work. This included carrying the decapitated body of Richard III and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's fiancée, making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including a seriously blackened eye. When Baldrick is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.\n\nThis Baldrick also has cunning plans that, contrary to most of those of his descendants, mostly work. For instance, when Edmund seeks to kill Dougal McAngus, Baldrick suggests that he gets a cannon, takes McAngus outside, makes him stick his head down the cannon and then blow it off. Edmund scoffs at this, and instead tries to kill McAngus using several different \"cunning plans\" of his own. After having failed miserably with all of these, he resorts to using Baldrick's original plan, which works.\n\nIt is Baldrick who suggests the title \"The Black Adder\" for Prince Edmund, which his descendants later adopt as a surname.\n\nThis Baldrick survived the last episode as he and Lord Percy had poisoned the wine to stop the Black Seal. But Percy poisoned the whole batch, killing the king, the queen, Prince Harry, the entire court and Edmund. He and Percy tried to stop them but they were too late, running in after the credits when everybody was already dead.\n\nThe \"clever\" Baldrick character was abandoned after the first series, becoming steadily more imbecilic with each incarnation.\n\nThe Elizabethan Baldrick is the servant and bondsman to Lord Blackadder. He has been in Blackadder's family since 1532, when he was two years old. He has a bedroom in Blackadder's house, but has also been forced to sleep in the gutter and on the roof. He has a tendency to eat dung. While his master treats him with utter contempt, he remains intensely loyal.\n\nThis Baldrick is considerably less intelligent than his medieval ancestor, although not as dim as future Baldricks. A kindly soul, Baldrick's lack of formal education is compensated for by his basic streetwise cunning. While his \"cunning plans\" do sometimes have a strange, twisted and often perverse logic and cunning to them, he is nevertheless incredibly stupid. For example, in the episode \"Head\", Blackadder attempts to teach Baldrick how to add, asking if he had \"two beans, and I add two more beans, what does that make?\" Baldrick replies, \"Some beans\", \"Three beans... and that one\", and \"a very small casserole\".\n\nBaldrick loves turnips, a trait that would also be present in his descendants. In the episode \"Beer\", where he and Percy famously discover a turnip shaped like a \"thingy\". Baldrick is particularly delighted by the discovery, because it contrasts with his own \"thingy\" which is shaped like a turnip. In the same episode Baldrick reveals his recipe for \"Turnip Surprise\" – \"the surprise is: there's nothing in it except the turnip\".\n\nBaldrick (possibly died 1649) is servant to . Like his Elizabethan ancestor he moonlights as an executioner, although in his case it is part of a cunning plan to save the life of Charles I of England by replacing his head with a pumpkin. His plan fails. When Blackadder is about to be captured he quickly disguises himself as a Roundhead and leaves Baldrick to be killed instead. He is the son of a pig farmer and a bearded lady.\n\nThe Baldrick of Regency Britain works as an \"underscrogsman\" (apprentice dogsbody) to Mr. E. Blackadder, butler to Prince George. He lives in a pipe in the upstairs water closet of the Palace.\n\nThe third Baldrick is much more noticeably crude and unintelligent than those previous to him and maybe even the most stupid of all four Baldricks. Like his Elizabethan ancestor, he is known to eat dung occasionally. He is also more childlike; when asked if he has any distinguishing features, referring to his nose he asserts, \"I've got this huge growth in the middle of my face.\" There is not the slightest sign of \"cunning\" in any of his plans, which include:\n\nBlackadder also claims that Baldrick has never changed his trousers, and implores him never to do so, for they are, Blackadder claims, akin to Pandora's Box, containing all the evils of the world.\n\nAlthough he is now on a closer social standing to Blackadder than before, he still receives the same (and possibly more) level of abuse as his Elizabethan ancestor. Blackadder punches him; kicks him; breaks a milk-jug over his head; smashes a huge turnip on his head; roasts him for a few minutes on a spit; grabs him by the shirt collar; threatens to cut him up into strips and tell the prince that he \"walked over a very sharp cattle grid in an extremely heavy hat\"; and promises five minutes of hellish tortures involving a small pencil, surpassing anything possible from Beelzebub over all eternity. However, he does seem to have a higher level of friendship with Blackadder than the other series.\n\nHowever, despite his noticeable flaws, this Baldrick has more success than any of the others. In an election rigged by Blackadder, he is elected Member of Parliament for Dunny-on-the-Wold, a rotten borough, although he was intended to be a puppet for Blackadder to manipulate (Blackadder's political opponents succeed in manipulating him instead). He is later made a Lord by Prince George, and is therefore eligible to sit in the House of Lords – whether or not he ever does so is another matter, as he is never again referred to by his title after episode 1. Baldrick also succeeds where no Baldrick has succeeded before or since, in calling Blackadder \"a lazy, big nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".\n\nBaldrick spends the £400,000 he received as a Lord on an enormous turnip (\"Well, I had to haggle.\") which he refers to as \"dream turnip\". However, Blackadder later destroys it by crushing it on Baldrick's head.\n\nBaldrick is not given any sort of first name until this third series, when he speculates that it might be \"Sodoff\", since in childhood when he played in the gutter when he said to the other snipes, \"Hello, my name's Baldrick,\" they would reply, \"Yes, we know. Sod off, Baldrick!\" A diplomatic Blackadder opts to record him as \"S. Baldrick\". The initial appears to have been adopted by his descendants. In a 1988 episode of \"The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow\", Baldrick of \"Blackadder the Third\" is on trial during \"Clown Court\". During the \"trial\" Baldrick reveals that he thinks his name is \"Dropdead\", since people who see him shout out \"Drop dead, Baldrick!\". The presiding judge, Lord Chief Justice Noel Edmonds, notes the name as \"Mr. D. Baldrick\".\n\nThis particular specimen of Baldrick can also be noted for his definition of \"dog\": \"Not a cat\" and \"C\": \"Big, blue wobbly thing what mermaids live in\". His command with words is also demonstrated in his \"magnificent octopus\" (\"magnum opus\"), a semi-autobiographical work that goes \"Once upon a time, there was a lovely little sausage called Baldrick, and it lived happily ever after.\"\n\nBaldrick later presented this story to Dr. Samuel Johnson as a replacement for the first dictionary (which he burned by mistake). The story had an unexpected effect on Johnson – he was reminded that he had forgotten to put the word \"sausage\" in his dictionary, and ran off in horror.\n\nHis heroes are the highwayman \"The Shadow\" and The Scarlet Pimpernel, (or the \"Scarlet Pimple\" as Baldrick believes his name to be). The former was executed as a result of Blackadder's informing, and the latter was poisoned by him.\n\nThis Baldrick grew up in a \"haunted hovel\", in which a vile, disgusting apparition would slowly make its way into his parents' bed at night. Curiously, this phantom vanished the very day Baldrick left home. In one cunning plan Baldrick tried to chop his mother's head off to solve the problem of her low ceiling.\n\nAs mentioned in the episode Sense and Senility, his uncle with the Baldrick surname once played as a \"second codpiece\" for the leading character of \"Macbeth\", but only in the fight scenes. Blackadder concludes that the uncle was a \"stunt codpiece\" and inquires if he ever had a \"large part\", to which Baldrick answers that it \"depends who was playing Macbeth\".\n\nOddly enough, this Baldrick seems to have a bit of the idiot savant in him; Baldrick's explanation, although heard from someone else, of why George and Blackadder will be able to trade places is surprisingly smart and articulate, suggesting he might have an amazing memory with words, even if he does not understand what they mean.\nHe also occasionally exhibits a surprising amount of knowledge of current events. When Edmund orders him to hire a horse, he replies: \"Hire you a horse? For ninepence? On Jewish New Year? In the rain? A bare fortnight after the dreaded horse plague of old London Town? With the blacksmiths' strike in its fifteenth week and the Dorset horse fetishists fair tomorrow?\" His reward for this is to be saddled (literally) with the job of horse himself.\n\nDespite his lack of intelligence, though, he was, in \"Duel and Duality\", able to manipulate Mrs. Miggins' casual conversation about how stupid Prince George was (George himself was present) so that it did not offend George. Additionally, in \"Sense and Senility\", he warns the Prince of a supposed plot to kill him.\n\nMr. Baldrick is assistant in Ebenezer Blackadder's moustache shop. While still stupid, it seems that having to work for the exceedingly gullible Mr Blackadder has forced him to develop some of the savvy of his earlier ancestors. Unlike his previous (and later) ancestors, he has a simile of his own to match Blackadder's: \"I just wish we weren't doing so well in the 'bit-short-of-pressies-and-feeling-a-gullible-prat' ledger.\" He remains the only person to be fooled by Tiny Tom Scratchit's alleged lameness, however. He is also possibly the only person ever to spell \"Christmas\" without getting \"any\" of the letters right (he apparently renders the word as \"Kwelfnuve\" then \"corrects\" it to \"Kweznuz\").\n\nPrivate S. Baldrick (presumed dead 1917) is a private in a First World War trench, serving under Captain Blackadder and Lieutenant George. His hero is Lord Flashheart.\n\nThe fourth Baldrick comes from the lowest level of British Edwardian society. Before the war he was scraping a living at the \"Turnip Street Workhouse\". Upon the outbreak of hostilities the workhouse formed its own pals battalion which Baldrick signed up to join. In the final episode he says that all his friends have died, suggesting that he is the last surviving member of the Turnip Street Workhouse Pals.\n\nEqual in foulness to the third Baldrick, Private Baldrick also matches his immediate predecessor in terms of stupidity. His \"cunning plans\", like those of his Elizabethan ancestor, have an insane, perverse logic to them. Examples include carving his name on a bullet, in relation to the old saying \"a bullet with your name on it\", his explanation being that if he owns the bullet, it won't ever kill him as he won't ever shoot himself (\"shame\", comments Captain Blackadder), and the chances of there being two bullets with \"Baldrick\" on them are \"very small indeed\". He has also been known to eat cigarettes as seen in the last episode of the series.\n\nHe also is the only Baldrick to confront Blackadder after being hit; he does so on one occasion, and is very conscious of class divisions. While this briefly attracts him to the ideals of Bolshevism, he is just as willing to marry General Melchett if it allows him to escape his lower-class status. His family seem to worship Lord Flashheart, declaring that they all took up smoking to collect cigarette cards bearing his image and that his grandmother smoked herself to death so they could afford the album.\n\nIn the first episode, \"Captain Cook\", he claims to be the first Baldrick in the entire family tree to have a brilliant plan (becoming cooks for HQ to escape the trenches), giving a speech saying, \"Permission to write home immediately sir! This is the first brilliant plan a Baldrick's ever had. For centuries we've tried, and they've always turned out total pig swill! My mum will be pleased as punch.\" This mood was however, slightly dampened when Blackadder pointed out the minor flaw: Baldrick is \"the worst cook in the entire world\". He also hates hospitals because his grandfather went into one and when he came out, he was dead. Blackadder then points out that he was also dead when he went in, because he'd been run over by a traction engine.\n\nPrivate Baldrick's hobbies include cookery; his specialities include gourmet recipes involving rats.\n\nThis Baldrick is also a poet, composing \"The German Guns\". During his time in the trenches, Baldrick also wrote a second poem.\n\nS. Baldrick also does a Charlie Chaplin impression (although some believe it to be a slug balancing act, and General Melchett mistook it for a feeble impression of Buster Keaton).\n\nApart from during Blackadder's demonstration of slapstick comedy in the same episode, Baldrick generally does not get physically abused by Blackadder, although Blackadder frequently insults Baldrick and his family.\n\nThe opening sequence to each episode of series 4 features a ceremonial parade in which the company led by Captain Blackadder marches past General Melchett on a reviewing stand. Baldrick appears as part of the regimental band, splendid in scarlet and blue full dress, but not only walking out of line but also playing that most unmartial of instruments: a triangle.\n\nDespite his stupidity, Baldrick delivers a profound speech while in preparation for the \"final push\", tension is high, and Baldrick demands, \"Why can't we just stop sir? Why can't we just say 'no more killing, let's all go home'? Why would it be stupid just to pack it in, sir? Why?\" Neither Captain Blackadder nor Lieutenant George are able to come up with a good answer beyond an attempted accusation of defeatism from George.\n\nPrivate Baldrick never got to tell the audience his final \"cunning plan\" to escape the trenches, as he is sent \"over the top\" before he can reveal it to Blackadder, George and Captain Darling, though it possibly involved a splinter on the ladder. However, Baldrick stated that Blackadder was correct in the final plan being \"as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University\". Blackadder admits that \"whatever it was, it was better than my idea of pretending to be mad. Who'd ever notice another mad man round here?\" The episode's ending implies that Baldrick is killed in that attack.\n\nBaldrick is a septic tank cleaner to the 20th century Lord Blackadder in \"\". His first appearance is serving Blackadder's millennium dinner, which he does wearing nothing but an amusing apron, on a whim. His cooking is similar to Private Baldrick's; he prepared dinner by coughing over an avocado. His underpants may date from the 18th century, or in any case smell as though they do, and turn out to be the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs. Rather surprisingly he builds a working time machine, making him \"the greatest genius who ever lived\". Or it would do, if he knew \"how\" it worked and had not just built it using a combination of the plans of Leonardo da Vinci and an apparent skill at building Airfix models being able to make up for his inability to read the plans. Following his master's rewriting of history, he becomes Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – and possibly dictator, as the television commentator observes that elections have been abolished (although how much power he has with Edmund as king is questionable). His intelligence appears to be between that of the medieval Baldrick and the Elizabethan Baldrick. His \"cunning plan\" was possibly the only plan which a Blackadder ever thought was a good plan, albeit with a slight modification to it.\n\nAlso, Legionary Baldricus is a soldier under Centurion Blaccadicus in the Roman Britain section of \"\" as part of the forces defending Hadrian's Wall. He is apparently bilingual (although it is possible he is a local conscript and does not really understand Latin). He wears his helmet back to front, and was presumably killed by the attacking \"Scots\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "690865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690865", "title": "Billy Graham", "text": "Billy Graham\n\nWilliam Franklin Graham Jr. (November 7, 1918 – February 21, 2018) was an American evangelist, a prominent evangelical Christian figure, and an ordained Southern Baptist minister who became well-known internationally in the late 1940s. One of his biographers has placed him \"among the most influential Christian leaders\" of the 20th century.\n\nAs a preacher, he held large indoor and outdoor rallies with sermons broadcast on radio and television; some were still being re-broadcast into the 21st century. In his six decades of television, Graham hosted annual \"Crusades\", evangelistic campaigns, which ran from 1947 until his retirement in 2005. He also hosted the radio show \"Hour of Decision\" from 1950 to 1954. He repudiated racial segregation. In addition to his religious aims, he helped shape the worldview of a huge number of people who came from different backgrounds, leading them to find a relationship between the Bible and contemporary secular viewpoints. According to his website, Graham preached to live audiences of 210 million people in more than 185 countries and territories through various meetings, including BMS World Mission and Global Mission.\n\nGraham was a spiritual adviser to U.S. presidents and provided spiritual counsel for every president from the 33rd, Harry S. Truman, to the 44th, Barack Obama. He was particularly close to Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson (one of Graham's closest friends), and Richard Nixon. He insisted on racial integration for his revivals and crusades, starting in 1953, and invited Martin Luther King Jr. to preach jointly at a revival in New York City in 1957. He was also lifelong friends with another televangelist, the founding pastor of the Crystal Cathedral, Robert Schuller, whom Graham talked into starting his own television ministry.\n\nGraham operated a variety of media and publishing outlets. According to his staff, more than 3.2 million people have responded to the invitation at Billy Graham Crusades to \"accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior\". Graham's evangelism was appreciated by mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic denominations as he encouraged new converts to become members of these Churches. As of 2008, Graham's estimated lifetime audience, including radio and television broadcasts, topped 2.2 billion. One special televised broadcast in 1996 alone may have reached a television audience of as many as 2.5 billion people worldwide. Because of his crusades, Graham preached the gospel to more people in person than anyone in the history of Christianity. Graham was on Gallup's list of most admired men and women 61 times, more than any man or woman in history. Grant Wacker writes that by the mid-1960s, he had become the \"Great Legitimator\": \"By then his presence conferred status on presidents, acceptability on wars, shame on racial prejudice, desirability on decency, dishonor on indecency, and prestige on civic events\".\n\nWilliam Franklin Graham Jr. was born on November 7, 1918, in the downstairs bedroom of a farmhouse near Charlotte, North Carolina. He was of Scots-Irish descent and was the eldest of four children born to Morrow (née Coffey) and William Franklin Graham Sr., a dairy farmer. Graham was raised on a family dairy farm with his two younger sisters, Catherine Morrow and Jean and a younger brother, Melvin Thomas. When he was eight years old in 1927, the family moved about from their white frame house to a newly built red brick home. He was raised by his parents in the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Graham attended the Sharon Grammar School. He started to read books from an early age and loved to read novels for boys, especially \"Tarzan\". Like Tarzan, he would hang on the trees and gave the popular Tarzan yell, scaring both horses and drivers. According to his father, that yelling had led him to become a minister. When he was fourteen in 1933, Prohibition ended in December, and Graham's father forced him and his sister, Katherine, to drink beer until they got sick. This created such an aversion that Graham and his sister avoided alcohol and drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\nGraham had been turned down for membership in a local youth group for being \"too worldly\" when Albert McMakin, who worked on the Graham farm, persuaded him to go and see the evangelist Mordecai Ham. According to his autobiography, Graham was converted in 1934, at age 16 during a series of revival meetings in Charlotte led by Ham.\n\nAfter graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham attended Bob Jones College, then located in Cleveland, Tennessee. After one semester, he found it too legalistic in both coursework and rules. At this time he was influenced and inspired by Pastor Charley Young from Eastport Bible Church. He was almost expelled, but Bob Jones Sr. warned him not to throw his life away: \"At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks ... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily.\"\n\nIn 1937 Graham transferred to the Florida Bible Institute in Temple Terrace, Florida, near Tampa. He preached his first sermon that year at Bostwick Baptist Church near Palatka, Florida, while still a student. In his autobiography, Graham wrote of receiving his \"calling on the 18th green of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club\", which was adjacent to the Institute campus. Reverend Billy Graham Memorial Park was later established on the Hillsborough River, directly east of the 18th green and across from where Graham often paddled a canoe to a small island in the river, where he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. In 1939, Graham was ordained by a group of Southern Baptist clergymen at Peniel Baptist Church in Palatka, Florida. In 1943, Graham graduated from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois, with a degree in anthropology.\n\nDuring his time at Wheaton, Graham decided to accept the Bible as the infallible word of God. Henrietta Mears of the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood (Hollywood, California) was instrumental in helping Graham wrestle with the issue. He settled it at Forest Home Christian Camp (now called Forest Home Ministries) southeast of the Big Bear Lake area in southern California. A memorial there marks the site of Graham's decision.\n\nOn August 13, 1943, Graham married Wheaton classmate Ruth Bell, whose parents were Presbyterian missionaries in China. Her father, L. Nelson Bell, was a general surgeon. Ruth Graham died on June 14, 2007, at the age of 87. The Grahams were married for almost 64 years.\n\nGraham and his wife had five children together: Virginia Leftwich (Gigi) Graham (b. 1945), an inspirational speaker and author; Anne Graham Lotz (b. 1948), runs AnGeL ministries; Ruth Graham (b. 1950), founder and president of Ruth Graham & Friends, leads conferences throughout the US and Canada; Franklin Graham (b. 1952), serves as president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and as president and CEO of international relief organization, Samaritan's Purse; and Nelson Edman Graham (b. 1958), a pastor who runs East Gates Ministries International, which distributes Christian literature in China.\n\nAt the time of his death, Graham had 19 grandchildren, including former pastor Tullian Tchividjian, 41 great-grandchildren and 6 great-great-grandchildren.\n\nWhile attending college, Graham became pastor of the United Gospel Tabernacle and also had other preaching engagements.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1944, Graham briefly served as pastor of the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, which was not far from Wheaton. While there, his friend Torrey Johnson, pastor of the Midwest Bible Church in Chicago, told Graham that his radio program, \"Songs in the Night\", was about to be canceled due to lack of funding. Consulting with the members of his church in Western Springs, Graham decided to take over Johnson's program with financial support from his congregation. Launching the new radio program on January 2, 1944, still called \"Songs in the Night\", Graham recruited the bass-baritone George Beverly Shea as his director of radio ministry. While the radio ministry continued for many years, Graham decided to move on in early 1945.\n\nIn 1948 at the age of 29, he became president of Northwestern Bible College in Minneapolis and the youngest president of a college or university in the country, from which he resigned in 1952. Graham initially intended to become a chaplain in the Armed Forces, but he contracted mumps shortly after applying for a commission. After a period of recuperation in Florida, he was hired as the first full-time evangelist of the new Youth for Christ (YFC), co-founded by Torrey Johnson and the Canadian evangelist Charles Templeton. Graham traveled throughout both the United States and Europe as a YFCI evangelist. Templeton applied to Princeton Theological Seminary for an advanced theological degree and urged Graham to do so as well, but he declined as he was already serving as the president of Northwestern Bible College.\n\nGraham scheduled a series of revival meetings in Los Angeles in 1949, for which he erected circus tents in a parking lot. He attracted national media coverage, especially in the conservative Hearst chain, although Hearst and Graham never met. The crusade event ran for eight weeks – five weeks longer than planned. Graham became a national figure with heavy coverage from the wire services and national magazines.\n\nFrom the time his ministry began in 1947, Graham conducted more than 400 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham Crusade, held September 13–21, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. Graham was 28 years old. He called them crusades, after the medieval Christian forces who conquered Jerusalem. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the gospel and invite people to come forward (a practice begun by Dwight L. Moody). Such people were called inquirers and were given the chance to speak one-on-one with a counselor, to clarify questions and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the Gospel of John or a Bible study booklet. In Moscow, in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call. During his crusades, he frequently used the altar call song, \"Just As I Am\".\n\nGraham was offered a five-year, $1 million contract from NBC to appear on television opposite Arthur Godfrey, but he had prearranged commitments. He turned down the offer in order to continue his touring revivals. Graham had crusades in London, which lasted 12 weeks, and a New York City crusade in Madison Square Garden in 1957, which ran nightly for 16 weeks.\n\nGraham spoke at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's Urbana Student Missions Conference at least nine times — in 1948, 1957, 1961, 1964, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1984, and 1987.\n\nAt each Urbana conference, he challenged the thousands of attendees to make a commitment to follow Jesus Christ for the rest of their lives. He often quoted a six-word phrase that was reportedly written in the Bible of William Whiting Borden, the son of a wealthy silver magnate: \"No reserves, no retreat, no regrets\". Borden had died in Egypt on his way to the mission field.\n\nGraham also held evangelistic meetings on a number of college campuses: at the University of Minnesota during InterVarsity's \"Year of Evangelism\" in 1950–51, a 4-day mission at Yale University in 1957, and a week-long series of meetings at the University of North Carolina's Carmichael Auditorium in September 1982.\n\nIn 1955 he was invited by students to lead the mission to Cambridge University, arranged by the CICCU, with the London pastor-theologian John Stott as his chief assistant. This invitation was greeted with much disapproval in the correspondence columns of \"The Times\".\n\nIn 1950, Graham founded the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) with its headquarters in Minneapolis. The association relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1999. BGEA ministries have included:\n\nIn April 2013, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started \"My Hope With Billy Graham\", the largest outreach in its history, encouraging church members to spread the gospel in small group meetings after showing a video message by Graham. \"The idea is for Christians to follow the example of the disciple Matthew in the New Testament and spread the gospel in their own homes.\" The video, called \"The Cross\", is the main program in the My Hope America series and was also broadcast the week of Graham's 95th birthday.\n\nGraham's early crusades were segregated, but he began adjusting his approach in the 50s. During a 1953 rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Graham tore down the ropes that organizers had erected in order to segregate the audience into racial sections. In his memoirs, he recounted that he told two ushers to leave the barriers down \"or you can go on and have the revival without me.\" He warned a white audience, \"we have been proud and thought we were better than any other race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride.\"\n\nIn 1957, Graham's stance towards integration became more publicly shown when he allowed black ministers Thomas Kilgore and Gardner C. Taylor to serve as members of his New York Crusade's executive committee and invited the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whom he first met during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, to join him in the pulpit at his 16-week revival in New York City, where 2.3 million gathered at Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium, and Times Square to hear them. Graham recalled in his autobiography that during this time, he and King developed a close friendship and that he was eventually one of the few people who referred to King as \"Mike\", a nickname which King asked only his closest friends to call him. Following King's assassination in 1968, Graham mourned that the US had lost \"a social leader and a prophet\". In private, Graham advised King and other members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).\n\nDespite their friendship, tensions between Graham and King emerged in 1958 when the sponsoring committee of a crusade which took place in San Antonio, Texas on July 25 arranged for Graham to be introduced by that state's segregationist governor, Price Daniel. On July 23, King sent a letter to Graham and informed him that allowing Daniel to speak at a crusade which occurred the night before the state's Democratic Primary \"can well be interpreted as your endorsement of racial segregation and discrimination.\" Graham's advisor, Grady Wilson, replied to King that \"even though we do not see eye to eye with him on every issue, we still love him in Christ.\" Though Graham's appearance with Daniel dashed King's hopes of holding joint crusades with Graham in the Deep South, the two still remained friends and King told a Canadian television audience the following year that Graham had taken a \"very strong stance against segregation.\" Graham and King would also come to differ on the Vietnam War. After King's \"\" speech denouncing US intervention in Vietnam, Graham castigated him and others for their criticism of US foreign policy.\n\nBy the middle of 1960, King and Graham traveled together to the Tenth Baptist World Congress of the Baptist World Alliance. In 1963, Graham posted bail for King to be released from jail during the Birmingham campaign, according to Long (2008), and the King Center acknowledged that Graham had bailed King out of jail during the Albany Movement, although historian Steven Miller told CNN he could not find any proof of the incident. Graham held integrated crusades in Birmingham, Alabama, on Easter 1964 in the aftermath of the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, and toured Alabama again in the wake of the violence that accompanied the first Selma to Montgomery march in 1965.\n\nFollowing his death, former SCLC official and future Atlanta politician Andrew Young acknowledged his friendship with Graham and stated that Graham did in fact travel with King to the 1965 European Baptist Convention. Young also claimed that Graham had often invited King to his crusades in the Northern states.\n\nGraham's faith prompted his maturing view of race and segregation; he told a member of the Ku Klux Klan that integration was necessary primarily for religious reasons: \"There is no scriptural basis for segregation,\" Graham argued. \"The ground at the foot of the cross is level, and it touches my heart when I see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at the cross.\"\n\nThe friendship between Graham and John Stott led to a further partnership in the Lausanne Movement, of which Graham was a founder. It built on Graham's 1966 World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin. In collaboration with \"Christianity Today\", Graham convened what \"TIME\" magazine described as \"a formidable forum, possibly the widest–ranging meeting of Christians ever held\" with 2,700 participants from 150 nations gathering for the International Congress on World Evangelization. This took place in Lausanne, Switzerland (July 16–25, 1974), and the movement which ensued took its name from the host city. Its purpose was to strengthen the global church for world evangelization, and to engage ideological and sociological trends which bore on this. Graham invited Stott to be chief architect of the Lausanne Covenant, which issued from the Congress and which, according to Graham, \"helped challenge and unite evangelical Christians in the great task of world evangelization.\" The movement remains a significant fruit of Graham's legacy, with a presence in nearly every nation.\n\nGraham played multiple roles that reinforced each other. Grant Wacker identifies eight major roles he played: preacher, icon, Southerner, entrepreneur, architect (or bridge builder), pilgrim, pastor and finally his widely recognized status as America's Protestant patriarch, on a par with Martin Luther King and Pope John Paul II.\n\nGraham as bridge builder deliberately reached into the secular world. For example, as entrepreneur he built his own pavilion for the 1964 New York World's Fair. He appeared as a guest on a 1969 Woody Allen television special, where he joined the comedian in a witty exchange on theological matters.\nDuring the Cold War, Graham-the-bridge-builder became the first evangelist of note to speak behind the Iron Curtain, addressing large crowds in countries throughout Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, calling for peace. During the apartheid era, Graham consistently refused to visit South Africa until its government allowed integrated seating for audiences. During his first crusade there in 1973, he openly denounced apartheid. Graham also corresponded with imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela during the latter's 27-year imprisonment.\nIn 1984, he led a series of meetings in the United Kingdom summer, called Mission England, using outdoor football (soccer) grounds as venues.\n\nGraham was interested in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists from around the world; with the largest representations of nations ever held until that time. Over 157 nations were gathered in 2000 at the RAI Convention Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At one revival in Seoul, South Korea, Graham attracted more than one million people to a single service. He appeared in China in 1988 – for Ruth, this was a homecoming, since she had been born in China to missionary parents. He appeared in North Korea in 1992.\n\nOn October 15, 1989, Graham received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Graham was the only minister, functioning in that capacity, to receive one.\n\nOn September 22, 1991, Graham held his largest event in North America on the Great Lawn of New York's Central Park. City officials estimated more than 250,000 in attendance. In 1998, Graham spoke at TED (conference) to a crowd of scientists and philosophers.\n\nOn September 14, 2001, only three days after the World Trade Center attacks, Graham was invited to lead a service at Washington National Cathedral, which was attended by President George W. Bush and past and present leaders. He also spoke at the memorial service following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. On June 24–26, 2005, Billy Graham began what he has said would be his last North American crusade, three days at the Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in New York City. But on the weekend of March 11–12, 2006, Billy Graham held the \"Festival of Hope\" with his son, Franklin Graham. The festival was held in New Orleans, which was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.\n\nGraham prepared one last sermon, \"My Hope America\", released on DVD and played around America and possibly worldwide between November 7–10, 2013, November 7 being his 95th birthday, hoping to cause a revival.\n\nGraham said that his planned retirement was because of his failing health; he had suffered from hydrocephalus from 1992 on. In August 2005, Graham appeared at the groundbreaking for his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Then 86, he used a walker during the ceremony. On July 9, 2006, he spoke at the Metro Maryland Franklin Graham Festival, held in Baltimore, Maryland, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\n\nIn April 2010, Graham, at 91 and with substantial vision, hearing and balance loss, made a rare public appearance at the re-dedication of the renovated Billy Graham Library.\n\nThere had been controversy over Graham's proposed burial place; he announced in June 2007 that he and his wife would be buried alongside each other at the Billy Graham Library in his hometown of Charlotte. Graham's younger son Ned had argued with older son Franklin about whether burial at a library would be appropriate. Ruth Graham had said that she wanted to be buried not in Charlotte but in the mountains at the Billy Graham Training Center at The Cove near Asheville, North Carolina, where she had lived for many years; Ned supported his mother's choice. Novelist Patricia Cornwell, a family friend, also opposed burial at the library, calling it a tourist attraction. Franklin wanted his parents to be buried at the library site. At the time of Ruth Graham's death, it was announced that they would be buried at the library site.\n\nGraham died of natural causes on February 21, 2018, at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, at the age of 99.\n\nOn February 28 and March 1, 2018, Billy Graham became the fourth private citizen in United States history to lie in honor at the United States Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C. Graham is the first religious leader to be honored. At the ceremony, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called Graham \"America's pastor\". President Donald Trump said Graham was \"an ambassador for Christ\". In addition, Televangelist Jim Bakker paid respect to Graham, stating he was the greatest preacher since Jesus. He also said that Graham visited him in prison.\n\nA private funeral service was held on March 2, 2018. Graham was buried beside his wife at the foot of the cross-shaped brick walkway in the Prayer Garden on the northeast side of the Billy Graham Library. Graham's pine plywood casket, handcrafted in 2006 by inmates at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, is topped with a wooden cross nailed to it by the prisoners.\n\nAfter his close relationships with Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, Graham tried to avoid explicit partisanship. Bailey says:\n\nGraham was a registered member of the Democratic Party. In 1960 he was opposed to the candidacy of John F. Kennedy, fearing that because Kennedy was a Catholic, he would be bound to follow the Pope. Graham worked \"behind the scenes\" to encourage influential Protestant ministers to speak out against him. Graham met with a conference of Protestant ministers in Montreux, Switzerland, during the 1960 campaign, to discuss their mobilizing congregations to defeat Kennedy. According to the PBS \"Frontline\" program, \"God in America\" (2010), Episode 5, Graham also organized a meeting in September 1960 of hundreds of Protestant ministers in Washington, D.C. to this purpose; Norman Vincent Peale led the meeting. This was shortly before Kennedy's speech on the separation of church and state in Houston, Texas, which was considered to be successful in meeting concerns of many voters. After his election, however, Kennedy invited Graham to play golf in Palm Beach, Florida, after which Graham acknowledged Kennedy's election as an opportunity for Catholics and Protestants to come closer together. After they had discussed Jesus Christ at that meeting, the two remained in touch, meeting for the last time at a National Day of Prayer meeting in February 1963. In his autobiography, Graham claimed to have felt an \"inner foreboding\" in the week before Kennedy's assassination, and to have tried to contact him to say, \"Don't go to Texas!\"\n\nGraham leaned toward the Republicans during the presidency of Richard Nixon, whom he had met and befriended as Vice President under Dwight D. Eisenhower. He did not completely ally himself with the later religious right, saying that Jesus did not have a political party. He gave his support to various political candidates over the years.\n\nIn 2007, Graham explained his refusal to join Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority in 1979, saying: \"I'm for morality, but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the Panama Canal or superiority of armaments. Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people, right and left. I haven't been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future.\"\n\nAccording to a 2006 \"Newsweek\" interview, \"For Graham, politics is a secondary to the Gospel ... When \"Newsweek\" asked Graham whether ministers – whether they think of themselves as evangelists, pastors or a bit of both – should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some – like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'\"\n\nIn 2012, Graham publicly endorsed the Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. Shortly after, apparently in order to accommodate Romney, who is a Mormon, references to Mormonism as a religious cult (\"A cult is any group which teaches doctrines or beliefs that deviate from the biblical message of the Christian faith.\") were removed from Graham's website. Observers have questioned whether the support of Republican and religious right politics on issues such as same-sex marriage coming from Graham – who stopped speaking in public or to reporters – in fact reflects the views of his son, Franklin, head of the BGEA. Franklin denied this, and said that he would continue to act as his father's spokesperson rather than allowing press conferences.\n\nGraham had a personal audience with many sitting US presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama – 12 consecutive presidents. After meeting with Truman in 1950, Graham told the press he had urged the president to counter communism in North Korea. Truman disliked him and did not speak with him for years after that meeting. Later he always treated his conversations with presidents as confidential.\n\nTruman was not fond of Graham. He wrote about Graham in his 1974 autobiography \"Plain Speaking\", \"But now we've got just this one evangelist, this Billy Graham, and he's gone off the beam. He's...well, I hadn't ought to say this, but he's one of those counterfeits I was telling you about. He claims he's a friend of all the Presidents, but he was never a friend of mine when I was President. I just don't go for people like that. All he's interested in is getting his name in the paper.\"\nGraham became a regular visitor during the tenure of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He purportedly urged him to intervene with federal troops in the case of the Little Rock Nine to gain admission of black students to public schools. House Speaker Sam Rayburn convinced Congress to allow Graham to conduct the first religious service on the steps of the Capitol building in 1952. Eisenhower asked for Graham while on his deathbed.\n\nGraham met and would become a close friend of Vice President Richard Nixon, and supported Nixon, a Quaker, for the 1960 presidential election. He convened an August strategy session of evangelical leaders in Montreaux, Switzerland, to plan how best to oppose Nixon's Roman Catholic opponent, Senator John F. Kennedy. Though a registered Democrat, Graham also maintained firm support of aggression against the foreign threat of Communism and strongly sympathized with Nixon's views regarding American foreign policy. Thus, he was more sympathetic to Republican administrations.\n\nOn December 16, 1963, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was impressed by the way Graham had praised the work of his great-grandfather Rev. George Washington Baines, invited Graham to the White House to give him spiritual counseling. After this visit, Johnson frequently would call on Graham for more spiritual counselling as well as companionship. As Graham recalled to his biographer Frady, \"I almost used the White House as a hotel when Johnson was President. He was always trying to keep me there. He just never wanted me to leave.\"\n\nIn striking contrast with his more limited access with Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy, Graham would not only visit the White House private quarters but would also at times kneel at Johnson's bedside and then pray with him whenever the President requested him to do so. Graham once recalled \"I have never had many people do that.\" In addition to his White House visits, Graham would visit Johnson at Camp David and occasionally met with the President when he retreated to his private ranch in Stonewall, Texas. Johnson would also become the first sitting President to attend one of Graham's crusades, which took place in Houston, Texas, in 1965.\n\nDuring the 1964 United States presidential election, supporters of Republican nominee Barry Goldwater sent an estimated 2 million telegrams to Graham's hometown of Montreat, North Carolina, and sought the preacher's endorsement. Supportive of Johnson's domestic policies, and hoping to preserve his friendship with the President, Graham resisted pressure to endorse Goldwater and stayed neutral in the election. Following Johnson's election victory, Graham's role as the main White House pastor was solidified. At one point, Johnson even considered making Graham a member of his cabinet and grooming him to be his successor, though Graham insisted he had no political ambitions and wished to remain a preacher. Graham's biographer David Aikman acknowledged that the preacher was closer to Johnson than any other President he had ever known.\n\nHe spent the last night of Johnson's presidency in the White House, and he stayed for the first night of Nixon's. After Nixon's victorious 1968 presidential campaign, Graham became an adviser, regularly visiting the White House and leading the president's private worship services. In a meeting they had with Golda Meir, Nixon offered Graham the ambassadorship to Israel, but he refused.\n\nIn 1970, Nixon appeared at a Graham revival in East Tennessee, which they thought safe politically. It drew one of the largest crowds in Tennessee and protesters against the Vietnam War. Nixon was the first president to give a speech from an evangelist's platform. Their friendship became strained in 1973 when Graham rebuked Nixon for his post-Watergate behavior and the profanity heard on the Watergate tapes. They eventually reconciled after Nixon's resignation.\n\nGraham officiated at one presidential burial and one presidential funeral. He presided over the graveside services of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973 and took part in eulogizing the former president. Graham officiated at the funeral services of former First Lady Pat Nixon in 1993, and the death and state funeral of Richard Nixon in 1994. During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Graham asserted that he believed President Bill Clinton to be \"a spiritual person.\" He was unable to attend the state funeral of Ronald Reagan on June 11, 2004, as he was recovering from hip replacement surgery. This was mentioned by George W. Bush in his eulogy.\n\nOn April 25, 2010, President Barack Obama visited Graham at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, where they \"had a private prayer.\"\n\nGraham had a friendly relationship with Queen Elizabeth II and was frequently invited by the Royal Family to special events. They first met in 1955 and Graham preached at Windsor Chapel at the Queen's invitation during the following year. Their friendly relationship may have been because they shared a traditional approach to the practical aspects of the Christian faith.\n\nGraham was outspoken against communism and supported the American Cold War policy, including the Vietnam War. In a 1999 speech, Graham discussed his relationship with the late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, praising him as a \"different kind of communist\" and \"one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the Japanese.\" Graham went on to note that although he had never met Kim's son and former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, he had \"exchanged gifts with him.\"\n\nIn 1982, Graham preached in the Soviet Union and attended a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the war dead of World War II, when the Soviets were American allies in the fight against Nazism. He voiced fear of a second holocaust, not against Jews, but \"a nuclear holocaust\" and advised that \"our greatest contribution to world peace is to live with Christ every day.\"\n\nDuring the Watergate affair, there were suggestions that Graham had agreed with many of President Richard Nixon's antisemitic opinions, but he denied them and stressed his efforts to build bridges to the Jewish community. In 2002, the controversy was renewed when declassified \"Richard Nixon tapes\" confirmed remarks made by Graham to Nixon three decades earlier. Captured on the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that Jews control the American media, calling it a \"stranglehold\" during a 1972 conversation with Nixon, and suggesting that if Nixon was re-elected, they might be able to do something about it.\n\nWhen the tapes were made public, Graham apologized and said, \"Although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made in an Oval Office conversation with President Nixon ... some 30 years ago. ... They do not reflect my views and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks.\" According to \"Newsweek\" magazine, \"[T]he shock of the revelation was magnified because of Graham's longtime support of Israel and his refusal to join in calls for conversion of the Jews.\"\n\nIn 2009, more Nixon tapes were released, in which Graham is heard in a 1973 conversation with Nixon referring to Jews and \"the synagogue of Satan\". A spokesman for Graham said that Graham has never been an antisemite and that the comparison (in accord with the context of the quotation in the Book of Revelation) was directed specifically at those claiming to be Jews, but not holding to traditional Jewish values.\n\nAfter a 1957 crusade in New York, some more fundamentalist Protestant Christians criticized Graham for his ecumenism, even calling him \"Antichrist\".\n\nGraham expressed inclusivist views, suggesting that people without explicit faith in Jesus can be saved. In a 1997 interview with Robert Schuller, Graham said\n\nIain Murray, writing from a conservative Protestant standpoint, argues that \"Graham's concessions are sad words from one who once spoke on the basis of biblical certainties.\"\nIn 1970, Graham stated that feminism was \"an echo of our overall philosophy of permissiveness\" and that women did not want to be \"competitive juggernauts pitted against male chauvinists\". He further stated that the role of wife, mother, and homemaker was the destiny of \"real womanhood\" according to the Judeo-Christian ethic; Graham's assertions, published in the \"Ladies' Home Journal\", elicited letters of protest, and were offered as rebuttal to the establishment of \"The New Feminism\" section of the publication added following sit-in protest at the Journal offices demanding female representation on the staff of the publication.\n\nGraham was well-known for his practice of not spending time alone with any woman other than his wife. This has become known as the Billy Graham rule.\n\nBilly's daughter Bunny recounts her father denying her and her sisters higher education. As reported in \"The Washington Post\":\n\nBunny remembers being groomed for the life of wife, homemaker, and mother. \"There was never an idea of a career for us,\" she said. \"I wanted to go to nursing school – Wheaton had a five-year program – but Daddy said no. No reason, no explanation, just 'No.' It wasn't confrontational and he wasn't angry, but when he decided, that was the end of it.\" She added, \"He has forgotten that. Mother has not.\"\n\nBilly talked his future wife, Ruth, into abandoning her ambition to evangelize in Tibet in favor of staying in the United States to marry him – and that to do otherwise would be \"to thwart God's obvious will.\" After Ruth agreed to marry Billy, he cited the Bible for claiming authority over her, saying, \"then I'll do the leading and you do the following.\"\n\nGraham regarded homosexuality as a sin, and in 1974 described it as \"a sinister form of perversion.\" In 1993 he said that he thought AIDS might be a \"judgment\" from God, but two weeks later he retracted the remark, saying, \"I don't believe that, and I don't know why I said it.\"\n\nGraham opposed same-sex marriage, and in 2012, he took out full-page ads in favor of North Carolina Amendment 1, which banned it in North Carolina.\n\nGraham's stated position was that he did not want to talk about homosexuality as a political issue. Corky Siemaszko, writing for NBC News, noted that after the 1993 incident, Graham \"largely steered clear of the subject.\" After his death, however, some commentators called Graham \"homophobic\".\n\nGraham was frequently honored by surveys, including \"Greatest Living American\" and consistently ranked among the most admired persons in the United States and the world. He appeared most frequently on Gallup's list of most admired people. On the day of his death, Graham had been on Gallup's Top 10 \"Most Admired Man\" list 61 times, and held the highest rank of any person since the list began in 1948.\n\nIn 1967, he was the first Protestant to receive an honorary degree from Belmont Abbey College, a Roman Catholic school.\n\nIn 1983, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President Ronald Reagan.\n\nGraham received the Big Brother of the Year Award for his work on behalf of children. He was cited by the George Washington Carver Memorial Institute for his contributions to race relations. He received the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion and the Sylvanus Thayer Award for his commitment to \"Duty, Honor, Country\". The \"Billy Graham Children's Health Center\" in Asheville is named after and funded by Graham.\n\nIn 1999, the Gospel Music Association inducted Graham into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame to recognize his contributions to Christian music artists such as Michael W. Smith, dc Talk, Amy Grant, Jars of Clay and others who performed at the Billy Graham Crusades. Graham was the first non-musician inducted, and had also helped to revitalize interest in hymns and create new favorite songs. Singer Michael W. Smith was active in Billy Graham Crusades as well as Samaritan's Purse. Smith sang \"Just As I Am\" in a tribute to Graham at the 44th GMA Dove Awards. He also sang it at the memorial service honoring Graham at the United States Capitol rotunda on February 28, 2018.\n\nIn 2000, former First Lady Nancy Reagan presented the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award to Graham. Graham was a friend of the Reagans for years.\n\nIn 2001, Queen Elizabeth II awarded him an honorary knighthood. The honor was presented to him by Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US at the British Embassy in Washington DC on December 6, 2001.\n\nA professorial chair is named after him at the Alabama Baptist-affiliated Samford University, the Billy Graham Professor of Evangelism and Church Growth. His \"alma mater\" Wheaton College has an archive of his papers at the Billy Graham Center. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary has the Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism and Ministry. Graham has received 20 honorary degrees and refused at least that many more. In San Francisco, California, the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium is sometimes erroneously called the \"Billy Graham Civic Auditorium\" and falsely considered to be named in his honor, but it is actually named after the rock and roll promoter Bill Graham.\n\nOn May 31, 2007, the $27 million Billy Graham Library was officially dedicated in Charlotte. Former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton appeared to celebrate with Graham. A highway in Charlotte bears Graham's name, as does I-240 near Graham's home in Asheville.\n\nAs Graham's final Crusade approached in 2005, his friend Pat Boone chose to create a song in honor of Graham, which he co-wrote and produced with David Pack and Billy Dean, who digitally combined studio recordings of various artists into what has been called a \"'We Are the World'-type\" production. Named \"Thank You Billy Graham\", the song's video was introduced by Bono, and included Faith Hill, MxPx, John Ford Coley, John Elefante, Mike Herrera, Michael McDonald, Jeffrey Osborne, LeAnn Rimes, Kenny Rogers, Connie Smith, Michael Tait and other singers, with brief narration by Larry King, and was directed by Brian Lockwood as a tribute album. In 2013, the album \"My Hope: Songs Inspired by the Message and Mission of Billy Graham\" was recorded by Amy Grant, Kari Jobe, Newsboys, Matthew West, tobyMac and other music artists with new songs to honor Graham during his \"My Hope America with Billy Graham\" outreach and the publication of his book \"The Reason for My Hope: Salvation\". Other songs written to honor Graham include \"Hero of the Faith\" written by Eddie Carswell of NewSong, which became a hit, \"Billy, You're My Hero\" by Greg Hitchcock, \"Billy Graham\" by The Swirling Eddies, \"Billy Graham's Bible\" by Joe Nichols, \"Billy Frank\" by Randy Stonehill, and an original song titled \"Just as I Am\" by Fernando Ortega.\n\nThe movie \"\" premiered in theaters officially on October 10, 2008, less than one month before Graham's 90th birthday. Graham didn't comment on the film, but his son, Franklin released a critical statement on August 18, 2008, noting that the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association \"has not collaborated with nor does it endorse the movie.\" Graham's eldest daughter Gigi praised the movie and was hired as a consultant to help promote the film.\n\n\n\nGraham's \"My Answer\" advice column appeared in newspapers for more than 60 years as of 2017.\n\nGraham authored the following books; many of which have become bestsellers. In the 1970s, for instance, \"The Jesus Generation\" sold 200,000 copies in the first two weeks after its publication; \"Angels: God's Secret Agents\" had sales of a million copies within 90 days after release; \"How to Be Born Again\" was said to have made publishing history with its first printing of 800,000 copies.\"\n\n\n"}

He was also an anti-opium fighter, philanthropist and social reformer. He served in a number of important committees including the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Management Committee, the Central Midwives Board and the Council of King Edward VII College of Medicine. After the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, he joined the Advisory Council where he spoke out against social ills caused by the war. He founded the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1945 and formed the Chen Su Lan Trust in 1947.\n\nChen was born in Fuzhou, China as a third-generation Methodist. He enrolled at Anglo-Chinese College in Fuzhou when he was 15. At a revival meeting led by visiting Bishop Bradford, he pledged to become a preacher one day.\n\nIn 1905, he left for Singapore and enrolled to become one of the first students at the newly opened Straits Federated Malay States Government Medical School (later renamed King Edward VII Medical School, then King Edward VII College of Medicine). He obtained a Licentiate in Medicine at 1910, as part of the first batch of seven graduates. In addition, he also topped that class.\n\nAfter graduation, he was not only busy with his own practice but he served on a number of important committees, including the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Management Committee, the Central Midwives Board and the Council of King Edward VII College of Medicine. He also founded the Alumni Association of the Medical College was elected president of the Malayan branch of the British Medical Association.\n\nChen was deeply concerned with the social and health conditions in Singapore. He recognised that opium addiction was a grim social problem, not helped by the fact that the colonial government monopolised the sale of the drug as means to regulate its use. At the risk of being labelled disloyal to the British, Chen mounted a campaign against opium addiction. He was the president of the Singapore Anti-Opium Society and the director of the Anti-Opium Clinic which he founded in 1933. However, in 1937, the outbreak of war in China caused donations to be diverted to the China Relief Fund and thus the clinic had to close down.\n\nWhen the Pacific War broke out in December 1941, the Japanese army made steady progress in its conquest of the Malayan peninsula. Chen, who felt that Singapore would fall, decided to flee from the island. On 13 February 1942, he boarded one of the last ships leaving Singapore but unfortunately, the ship was attacked, bombed and set on fire. The passengers abandoned ship and Chen found himself adrift in the cold sea, clinging on to a raft with a few other survivors. During those hours in the water, he re-evaluated his life and realised he had not kept to his childhood commitment to be a preacher. He decided to live fully for God and not himself.\n\nUpon landing on short at a mangrove forest, Chen returned home only to be detained by the Kempeitai (Japanese military police). An informer had told the Japanese that Chen and other leaders of the Methodist Church were conspiring against the Japanese government. Although his home was searched, no evidence was found which would incriminate him, and he was released.\n\nAfter the war, the British Military Administration invited Chen to join the Advisory Council. Chen took the opportunity to speak out boldly against the numerous social problems that had arisen because of the war. To help solve these problems, in 1945, he founded the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association (now called the Metropolitan YMCA) to help provide demoralised youths with opportunities to rehabilitate themselves.\n\nTurning to his personal interest and commitment, he founded the Chen Su Lan Trust in 1947. The Trust disbursed funds and land to Christian organisations like Scripture Union, and for the founding in 1968 of the Methodist Children's Home which was named after him.\n\nIn 1969, Chen published a book entitled \"Pompong and Oxley Rise\", which recounted his childhood days and his experiences during the Japanese Occupation. He had been planning to do this since the war as a way to express his gratitude to God. Though he had not fulfilled his commitment to be a preacher in the literal sense, his whole life had been dedicated to serve God through serving the needs of others.\n\n"}

{"id": "28714151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28714151", "title": "Dave Karofsky", "text": "Dave Karofsky\n\nDavid \"Dave\" Karofsky, often referred to as Karofsky, is a recurring fictional character from the Fox musical comedy-drama series \"Glee\". The character is portrayed by actor Max Adler, and has appeared in \"Glee\" since its first season episode \"Mash-Up\", first broadcast on October 21, 2009. Initially known only by his surname, Karofsky was introduced as a bully and a member of the McKinley High football team who slushies football captain Finn (Cory Monteith), and who teams with fellow athlete and bully Azimio (James Earl) to torment various fellow students, usually members of the school glee club, New Directions. Later in the season, he is identified as a member of the football team, and is a football player in the second season. Karofsky is revealed to be a closeted homosexual early in that season, and is still closeted at the end of the season, though he has stopped being a bully, and has won the election for Junior Prom King. He transfers to another school for his senior year, but is outed there and after being bullied by his classmates he attempts suicide, though he is saved by his father.\n\nKarofsky was initially used as an ordinary jock bully, but Adler's acting impressed show co-creator Ryan Murphy; he expanded Karofsky's role in the show's second season by having him especially target gay glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), only to turn out to be gay himself, though closeted. That revelation sparked a wave of reaction from people who thought it was important for \"Glee\" to show \"the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted\". Reviewers have been impressed with Adler's portrayal of Karofsky, including Michael Slezak of \"TVLine\", who in the second season characterized it as \"surprisingly nuanced\" and with a \"terrific amount of depth\", and \"Billboard\" Rae Votta, who wrote in the third season, \"As always, Kurt and Karofsky's scenes shine as the strongest in whichever episode they're featured.\"\n\nIn the first season of \"Glee\", Karofsky appears in five episodes. He is a jock and a bully, initially a member of the McKinley High hockey team. He is first seen in the episode \"Mash-Up\", where he slushies football captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). He reappears in \"Mattress\", teamed with football player Azimio (James Earl), and writes on Finn's face with black markers to demonstrate how they will deface the glee club's yearbook photo, which Karofsky does at the end of the episode. By \"Theatricality\" he is on the football team with Azimio, and they shove Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) against lockers for wearing Lady Gaga costumes—part of a glee club assignment—around school.\n\nKarofsky is featured in the first eleven episodes of the second season continuing his bullying ways; in the sixth, \"Never Been Kissed\", he especially targets Kurt, who is gay. After he slams Kurt into a locker, Kurt chases after and confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, a stunned Kurt shoves him away, and Karofsky leaves. Kurt and his new gay friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) later try to talk to him about being gay and closeted, but he denies that the kiss happened and soon resumes his bullying. He even threatens to kill Kurt if he tells anyone else about the kiss. Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) finds out about the threat, but not the kiss, and Karofsky is soon expelled, but is allowed to return by the school board because no physical violence to Kurt had been witnessed; Kurt transfers to Dalton Academy to get away from him.\n\nThe football team has clinched a spot in the championship game, but animosity is running high between glee and non-glee members and harming the team's performance; in \"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\", Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) force the entire football team to join the glee club for a week to settle their differences and dispel their prejudices. Karofsky is praised by Will as a good performer and dancer, but when the hockey team attacks the football team for their low-status glee club activities, Karofsky leads a walkout from the joint rehearsals by all the non-glee members, and Beiste kicks them off the team. On championship night, the team members—except for Karofsky—relent just before the half-time show, which the team and glee club perform together. Karofsky joins in when he sees the crowd's positive reaction to the start of the half-time show, a mashup of \"Thriller\" and \"Heads Will Roll\"; the full team ultimately wins the game. Later, in school, Finn approaches Karofsky about joining the glee club and apologizing to Kurt, but Karofsky rejects his suggestion out of hand, since the championship victory has him back on top of the social ladder.\n\nKarofsky appears in three additional episodes later in the second season. Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) decides in the episode \"Born This Way\" that she wants to become prom queen; she sees Karofsky and realizes he would be a credible prom king partner moments before she sees him checking out a male student's butt and also realizes he is as closeted as she is. She then blackmails him into teaming up with her as a pretend couple—beards—and starting an anti-bullying club, with the purpose of getting Kurt to return to McKinley and New Directions. Karofsky apologizes to Kurt for his bullying in a meeting with Will, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), and their respective fathers Paul (Daniel Roebuck) and Burt; Kurt is happy to be able to transfer back. In \"Prom Queen\", with the prom less than a week away, Karofsky and Santana arrange to guard Kurt at school when they learn he will be bringing Blaine as his prom date; Karofsky tells Kurt, tearfully, that he is sorry for what he did to him. At the prom, Karofsky is voted prom king but Santana is not elected prom queen; instead, an appalled Kurt is written in and wins. As they take the floor for the traditional prom king and queen dance, Kurt suggests that this is Karofsky's chance to come out and \"make a difference\", but Karofsky is not ready to do so, and walks away.\n\nHe next appears in the third-season episode \"The First Time\". He has transferred to another high school from McKinley for his senior year, fearing that he might be outed if he stayed; he sees Kurt in a gay bar, and tells Kurt he has become a regular there and feels accepted. He is Kurt's secret admirer for Valentine's Day in the episode \"Heart\", and after Kurt gently turns him down, he is recognized by a classmate, who later spreads the word to others in the school that Karofsky is gay. In \"On My Way\", he is taunted and bullied by his athletic teammates and by others, at school and using online media, so severely that he attempts to hang himself, but is saved by his father, who finds him in time. Kurt visits Karofsky in the hospital where Karofsky tells Kurt his best friend never wants to see him again and how his mother thinks he has a disease and can be \"cured\". Karofsky, in tears the whole time, again apologizes to Kurt saying he made Kurt's life hell but he couldn't handle it himself, and the two agree to become friends.\n\nIn the sixth season, Karofsky is dating Blaine, but when he finds out that Blaine still loves Kurt they break up on good terms. Karofsky appeared in the series finale at the end where he joined the entirety of the Glee club on stage for their final performance.\n\nDave Karofsky is played by actor Max Adler, who first appeared in the first season episode \"Mash-Up\", initially as a member of the William McKinley High School hockey team. Karofsky began as a background character who tormented members of the glee club, and was known only by his surname. So far as Adler knew, his role was for a single episode only, but he returned once more before the first half of the first season ended, and then three times in the nine episodes of the second half of that season. The last of these, \"Theatricality\", written and directed by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, proved to be pivotal: Murphy was impressed with his acting and wanted to write more for him.\n\nAlthough Karofsky begins the second season as an ordinary jock bully, Murphy hinted to Adler that there would be more in store for the character. According to Adler, Murphy approached him at the second-season premiere and said, we just wrote some really good stuff for you for episode six'.\" The actor recalls, \"I had no idea what that meant, until I read it!\" Adler had long wondered why his character behaved the way he did: \"I thought there's got to be a reason why he's so angry, why he's such a bully, why he's going out of his way to make other people's lives a living hell\". Although he had considered various ideas for Karofsky—\"maybe he was jealous of the glee club, maybe he was gay, maybe a million different things\"—when he got the script for that episode he \"was just as shocked as anybody else\" when his character kissed Kurt, though he \"thought it was so awesome that they would allow this character to go there.\"\n\nThere was a strong reaction from the show's viewers. Adler said, \"I've heard from a lot of fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted.\" He wants Karofsky to \"accept himself and come out because [he thinks] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling\", and noted, \"people do get hope from \"Glee\".\" He also said, \"I think [Ryan Murphy] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him.\" Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, \"This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending.\" At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as \"very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them day in and day out at school\", and they dreaded school because of it.\n\nIn addition to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, other aspects of his personality have been explored. In \"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\", when the football team is forced to spend a week working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the \"softer side\" of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club. After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that makes it sound like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do. Adler said, \"I feel like that it did make him happy and, obviously, he has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance or learn a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing that was such an obstacle to overcome.\" In \"Furt\" and \"Born This Way\", it is revealed that he had been kind, a cub scout, and an \"A\" student. However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter. Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in \"Born This Way\" is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in \"Prom Queen\", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next class period.\n\nThe first time Karofsky received significant notice from critics was for the second season's sixth episode, \"Never Been Kissed\". Amy Reiter of the \"Los Angeles Times\" commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience as much as it did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into \"a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own.\" MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed \"Never Been Kissed\" as \"one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced\", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and \"emotionally unsound\". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as \"The Atlantic\" Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on \"Furt\" of the bullying storyline as a \"very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved\". In \"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\", \"The A.V. Club\" Todd VanDerWerff wrote, \"I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies.\" Reiter commented, \"And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing.\"\nMichael Slezak of \"TVLine\" complimented \"Max Adler's surprisingly nuanced performance\" as Karofsky in \"Born This Way\": \"The complex play of emotions in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously came out to him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous.\" He added, \"Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky.\" VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode and the next one where the character appears, \"Prom Queen\". He said in his review of the latter, \"the characters I'm most interested in at this point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people trying to do the right thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves\". Meghan Brown of \"The Atlantic\" praised Karofsky's \"tearful apology to Kurt\" in that episode as being \"painful and poignant\", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... [Y]ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping \"Glee\" will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.\n\nKarofsky's reappearance and interaction with Kurt in the third-season episode \"The First Time\" received very positive reviews. Anthony Benigno of \"The Faster Times\" characterized the scene with Kurt and Karofsky as \"subtle\" and \"a home run\", and \"Entertainment Weekly\" Abby West called it a \"perfect little nuanced scene\", while Michael Ausiello of \"TVLine\" said it was his \"favorite scene of the episode\". His next appearance in \"Heart\", again with Kurt, was described by Slezak as \"electric, with Kurt tenderly giving the 'just friends' speech to Dave\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" Joseph Brannigan Lynch thought the plot of having Karofsky be Kurt's secret admirer was \"vaguely stalker-ish on Karofsky's part, and contrived on the part of the show\", and Robert Canning of IGN predicted that after Karofsky had been seen by his classmate, it would \"just be an episode or two before Karofsky gets bullied into thinking about suicide, if not actually taking his own life\". When he reviewed the next episode, \"On My Way\", which featured Karofsky's suicide attempt, Canning stated that his \"cynicism [in the \"Heart\" review] was won over by a powerfully acted and directed story\". He also said, \"the initial locker room scene was heartbreaking\" and \"Max Adler's subtle facial expressions were brilliant\".\n\nVanDerWerff wrote, \"The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, one of the best things Glee has ever done\", and Slezak called it \"as devastating as anything I’ve seen on TV this year\". \"HuffPost TV\" Crystal Bell applauded Adler \"for doing such an amazing job\" on the suicide scene. She stated, \"I would have preferred if Karofsky's story line would have been the focus of the entire episode.\" VanDerWerff commented that \"as the show got the little details of Karofsky's desperate act just right, the whole thing took on a weight\", and singled out the scene \"where the teachers talked about what had happened and the smash cut to Karofsky's father screaming at him to get up\" as \"heart-wrenching\". Bell declared that the \"best scene in the entire episode is when Kurt visits Karofsky in the hospital\". Lynch called it \"one of the most touching scenes of this season\" and \"guileless, well-acted and eye-watering\". Rae Votta of \"Billboard\" wrote, \"As always, Kurt and Karofsky's scenes shine as the strongest in whichever episode they're featured.\"\n\n"}

He is best known as the lyricist of many rock and roll hits. Pomus was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer in 1992, the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1992), and the Blues Hall of Fame (2012).\n\nBorn Jerome Solon Felder in 1925 in Brooklyn, New York, he was the son of Jewish immigrants. Felder became a fan of the blues after hearing a Big Joe Turner record. Having had polio as a boy, he walked with the help of crutches. Later, due to post-polio syndrome, exacerbated by an accident, Felder eventually relied on a wheelchair.\n\nHis brother is New York attorney Raoul Felder.\n\nUsing the stage name \"Doc Pomus\", teenager Felder began performing as a blues singer. His stage name was not inspired by anyone in particular; he just thought it sounded better for a blues singer than the name Jerry Felder. Pomus stated that more often than not, he was the only Caucasian in the clubs, but that as a Jew and a polio victim, he felt a special \"underdog\" kinship with African Americans, while in turn the audiences both respected his courage and were impressed with his talent. Gigging at various clubs in and around New York City, Pomus often performed with the likes of Milt Jackson, Mickey Baker and King Curtis. Pomus recorded approximately 40 sides as a singer in the '40s and '50s for record companies such as Chess, Apollo, Gotham and others.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Pomus started writing magazine articles as well as songwriting for artists such as Lavern Baker, Ruth Brown, Ray Charles and Big Joe Turner to earn more money to support a family, after he had married Willi Burke, a Broadway actress. His first big songwriting break came when he chanced upon the Coasters' version of his \"Young Blood\" on a jukebox while on honeymoon. Pomus wrote the song, then gave it to Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who radically rewrote it. Still, Pomus had co-credit as author, and he soon received a royalty check for $2,500 (US$ in dollars), which convinced him that songwriting was a career direction worth pursuing. By 1957, Pomus had given up performing for full-time songwriting. He collaborated with pianist Mort Shuman, whom he met when Shuman was dating Pomus's younger cousin, to write for Hill & Range Music Co./Rumbalero Music at its offices in New York City's Brill Building. Pomus asked Shuman to write with him because Pomus didn't then know much about rock and roll, whereas Shuman was familiar with many popular artists of the day. Their songwriting efforts had Pomus write the lyrics and Shuman the melody, although often they worked on both. They wrote the hit songs \"A Teenager in Love\", \"Save The Last Dance For Me\", \"Hushabye\", \"This Magic Moment\", \"Turn Me Loose\", \"Sweets For My Sweet\" (a hit for The Drifters and then The Searchers), \"Go Jimmy Go\", \"Little Sister\", \"Can't Get Used to Losing You\", \"Suspicion\", \"Surrender\" and \"(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame\".\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, Pomus wrote several songs with Phil Spector (\"Young Boy Blues\"; \"Ecstasy\"; \"What Am I To Do?\"), Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber (\"Young Blood\" and \"She's Not You\"), and other Brill Building-era writers. Pomus also wrote \"Lonely Avenue\", a 1956 hit for Ray Charles.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, in his eleventh-floor, two-room apartment at the Westover Hotel at 253 West 72nd Street, Pomus wrote songs with Dr. John, Ken Hirsch and Willy DeVille for what he said were \"...those people stumbling around in the night out there, uncertain or not always so certain of exactly where they fit in and where they were headed.\" These later songs (\"There Must Be A Better World\", \"There Is Always One More Time\", \"That World Outside\", \"You Just Keep Holding On\", and \"Something Beautiful Dying\" in particular)—recorded by Willy DeVille, B.B. King, Irma Thomas, Marianne Faithfull, Charlie Rich, Ruth Brown, Dr. John, James Booker, and Johnny Adams—are considered by some, including writer Peter Guralnick, musician and songwriter Dr. John, and producer Joel Dorn, to be signatures of his best craft.\n\nThe documentary film \"A.K.A. Doc Pomus\" (2012), conceived by Pomus' daughter Sharyn Felder, directed by filmmaker Peter Miller, edited by Amy Linton and produced by Felder, Hechter and Miller, details Pomus' life.\n\nPomus died on March 14, 1991 from lung cancer, at the age of 65 at NYU medical center in Manhattan.\n\nTogether with Shuman and individually, Pomus was a key figure in the development of popular music. They co-wrote such hits as \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"This Magic Moment\", \"Sweets for My Sweet\", \"Viva Las Vegas\", \"Little Sister\", \"Surrender\", \"Can't Get Used to Losing You\", \"Suspicion\", \"Turn Me Loose\" and \"A Mess of Blues\". \n\n"}

Isaac and Mary were both highly respected members of the Salem Village Church, and the community in general. Isaac played a significant role in the witch trials, which is often overlooked in history. Despite being one of the primary reasons for Mary's accusation, he desperately tried to clear his wife's name and put an end to the trials altogether.\n\nIsaac had been a highly prosperous farmer throughout his life, which resulted in a large and upscale home with a generous owning of land and property. Isaac Eastey, along with his father-in-law Jacob Towne, were lifelong enemies of the Putnam family (who were later the main accusers in the witch trials). The tension between the two powerful families originated with bitter warfare over the ownership of woodland. Isaac and Jacob at one point snuck onto Putnam property and chopped several of their trees down. This, and several other similar incidents, led to a full on, physical confrontation between a band of Putnam men and several Eastey men. However the Putnam clan outnumbered Isaac Eastey and his group, and the Putnams proclaimed a victory. Despite this, the feuding over land ownership between the Easteys and Putnams would last nearly a century. In 1655, Isaac Eastey married Mary Towne. The couple raised eleven children together, with only three of them surviving into adulthood: Isaac Jr. (1656–1714), Joseph (1657–1739), and Sarah (1660–1749).\n\nAnne Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, and several other young \"afflicted\" girls in Salem Village viciously accused Mary Eastey of being a witch.

Residents of Salem Village, Topsfield, and other neighboring towns were shocked to learn a woman of such pious character was accused of being a witch. However, townsfolk were well aware of the bitterness and hostility the Putnams held against Isaac Eastey, and Mary's father, Jacob. This, along with Mary's mother having a long-standing reputation of practicing witchcraft, are what most likely led to her accusation.

{"id": "7400026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7400026", "title": "Jeanie Boulet", "text": "Jeanie Boulet\n\nJeanie Boulet is a fictional character from the television series \"ER\". She was portrayed by Gloria Reuben as a recurring character midway in the first season, then as a regular from season 2 onwards. Reuben left the series in the 6th season, but in 2008 (season 14) she reprised the role for one episode.\n\nJeanie is HIV-positive. Along with \"General Hospital\"s Robin Scorpio, she is one of the only regular characters in American television history to contract HIV without eventually being killed off by the writers.\n\nIntroduced in season 1, episode 14 \"Long Day's Journey\", Jeanie Boulet was initially a recurring character involved in the story arc of the regular character Dr Peter Benton (played by Eriq La Salle). During the first season, Jeanie's storyline centred on her adulterous affair with Benton, which developed after he employed her to care for his senile mother — Jeanie was unhappy in marriage to a philandering husband named Al (played by Wolfgang Bodison and Michael Beach). Benton was depicted as a talented, \"self-assured\" but \"brooding\", defensive and serious doctor. Contrastingly, Jeanie was portrayed as emotional, caring and sensitive. Reuben has described Jeanie as \"strong-willed, sharp and intelligent, but, [she] has a dry sense of humor. She knows exactly what she's doing professionally, but she has a nurturing side, too.\" The personality differences between the characters lead to several clashes on-screen initially, as both have different ideas about what's best for Benton's ailing and progressively senile mother. In episode 20 \"Full Moon, Saturday Night\", Jeanie orders for Benton's mother to be held in restraints to prevent injury; Furious, Benton removes the restraints, leading her to fall from her bed. Benton and Jeanie grow closer as he subsequently accepts her guidance on how to care for his mother.\n\nIn his book, \"Bedside Manners: George Clooney and ER\", author Sam Keenleyside comments on the scenes, saying that the storyline was poignant, but that \"it gets lost in all the machinations of the rest of the show.\" The beginning of a blossoming romance saw a change in Benton's disposition over the following episodes, Keenleyside notes that he \"seems to be thawing [...] It's well-worth asking what's brought all this on, and the answer seems to be — if his dinner with Jeanie is any indication — that he's a young doctor in love. Whether he continues his nice-guy routine while he plays second fiddle to Jeanie's husband remains to be seen, but giving Benton a love-interest, no matter how ill-fated, will offer his character some much needed life outside the hospital.\" As the first season drew to a close in episode 25 \"Everything Old is New Again\", Benton is shown to be keen for their relationship to progress, asking Jeanie to leave her husband; by contrast Jeanie is reticent and pulls away, leaving the future of their relationship unclear. According to Keenleyside, this was a deliberate \"loose thread [...] left dangling to pull [viewers] back on to [their] sofas next season.\" He predicts, \"expect to see them together next September; that way the writers can gloss over all the messy in-between stuff and get right to the romance for the new season.\"\n\nJeanie progressed to regular character status by season 2. As the season came under way, it was revealed that her affair with Benton still continued, unbeknown to her husband, leaving Benton's authoritarian personality \"uncomfortably weakened\" as the third member of a love triangle. When Jeanie refused to leave her husband, the relationship ended on bad terms, setting up the next chapter in Jeanie's story as she finds employment as a Physician Assistant (PA) at the serial's focal setting of County Hospital's ER. This leads to hostilities from a dishevelled Benton, who proceeds to make her working life a \"living hell\", until she confronts him. In summary of the plot, Keenleyside noted that \"it's nice to see Jeanie being allowed to move beyond the quiet forcefulness that has thus far marked her relationshsip with Peter, and it's even better to see Benton with his tail between his legs for a change.\" As season 2 progressed, Jeanie was given storylines independent of Benton, allowing further character development as she interacts between other characters, staff and patients. This move was praised by Keenleyside, who commented, \"this brief look at Jeanie, free from Benton's brooding presence, indicates that \"ER\" is definitely the place for her character. If she's allowed to continue to develop her own character, instead of being forced into Benton's background, she could become a complement to [Dr] Carter. Like Carter, she cares about her work, but she's not afraid to stand up for herself — especially when Benton is in her way.\" However, he does note that Jeanie is perhaps \"thrust to the forefront too mechanically. She is forced to carry a heavier story load than her character is capable at this point.\" Episode 21 of season 2, \"Take These Broken Wings\", marked the beginning of one of Jeanie's notable storylines when her husband Al was admitted to the ER and subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive. As the second season drew to a close, Jeanie's HIV status was left in question, as was Dr Benton's.\n\nIn the opening episode of season 3, \"Dr. Carter, I Presume?\", \"ER\" writers dropped the \"requisite bombshell\" that Jeanie had tested positive for HIV, while Benton had tested negative. Jeanie decides to manage her illness in secrecy, refusing to divulge her status to her employers, a decision Benton disapproves of and he attempts to have her banned from treating patients with open wounds, although he falls short of revealing her secret. Jeanie's decision not to reveal her serostatus to her employers was the result of an encounter with a seropositive patient in the AIDS outpatient ward at County Hospital. The man, realizing Jeanie worked at the hospital, urged her to seek treatment for her HIV elsewhere, due to negative repercussions that may occur in the workplace. As a result of this, Jeanie is forced to pay for her HIV cocktail medication herself.\n\nIn addition to the professional and medical implications of Jeanie's health status, the romantic implications were also explored later on in season 3. Keenleyside comments, \"[Jeanie's] quietly reluctant decision not to go out with the friend of a patient hits just the right tone, registering not only her disappointment at having to pass up this opportunity, but also her realization that she may never be able to accept another. The counterpart to this scene, provided by Benton's tantalizing encounter with his former girlfriend, Carla, drives home the pain of [Jeanie's] situation very powerfully, although a deeper look at the romantic challenges facing people with HIV would still be very much welcome.\"\n\nJeanie Boulet was first introduced in season 1 as a recurring character. She was the physical therapist hired by Dr. Peter Benton to care for his aging mother. Jeanie, who was married at the time, soon began a romantic relationship with Benton but things fizzled when she could not make a decision about her marriage. She reappeared as a series regular a few episodes later in season 2, as a new physician assistant at the County General ER. Toward the end of the season, her husband Al was admitted to the hospital and it was discovered that he had contracted HIV. Jeanie and Al had been separated since the beginning of the season, but he may have contracted the virus years earlier as he had slept with other women during the time they were married.\n\nJeanie got tested for HIV and urged Benton, her recent lover, to undergo testing as well. In the season 3 premiere it was revealed that Benton did not have the virus; Jeanie, however, was HIV-positive. Benton questioned whether Jeanie should still be working in the ER, but he later accepted that she would be able to take appropriate precautions and supported her decision to remain at County. Later in the series, Jeanie and Peter actually became somewhat close, with Jeanie helping Peter cope with the realization that his son Reese was deaf.\n\nDuring season three, Jeanie embarked on her first romantic relationship since her HIV diagnosis, with a doctor from Infectious Diseases named Greg Fischer. However, during this time she also rekindles her closeness with Al and eventually Dr. Fischer breaks up with her upon finding out about the reunion. Jeanie and Al move back in together and renew their relationship. In season four, Al loses his job when an accident at the job site forces him to admit to his coworkers (and friends) that he is HIV positive. Al gets another job in Atlanta during the 4th season and plans to move; Jeanie declines to join him, and they part ways once more. Al was never seen on the show again but Jeanie bitterly references him in Season 5 when she learns she has contracted Hepatitis C and is sure Al is responsible; however, when she goes off to confront him over the phone Al faxes her accurate medical records which show he does NOT have that illness (this helps explain in a much later-run return by Jeanie why she has specific and emotional information about what has happened to Al since then).\n\nIt is also at this time that Jeanie develops a strong friendship with Kerry Weaver. Jeanie had initially been afraid that Weaver might terminate her position at County if she found out about Jeanie's HIV status. This turned out not to be the case, and Weaver laid out restrictions under which Jeanie would be allowed to continue treating patients while HIV positive. Kerry and Jeanie's friendship was tested when Kerry was forced to fire Jeanie for budgetary reasons. Jeanie accused Kerry of trying to fire her over her HIV status, as Jeanie had been forced to break one of her workplace restrictions in order to treat a trauma patient earlier, and threatened to sue the hospital for discrimination. Dr. Anspaugh gave Jeanie her job back to avoid the lawsuit, and Jeanie and Kerry eventually settled their difference.\n\nIn season four Jeanie becomes the part-time private care giver of Scott Anspaugh (portrayed by Trevor Morgan), the son of Dr. Donald Anspaugh. Scott is battling B-cell lymphoma and is battling depression. Only Jeanie seems to be able to raise his spirits and inspire hope in him. The two develop a strong friendship over a five episode arc which sadly ends in Scott's death.\n\nEarly in season six, Jeanie adopts an HIV positive baby boy called Carlos after his mother dies in the hospital, and marries a police officer named Reggie Moore. She tries to stay on at County and parent her child, but eventually decides to leave County in order to spend more time with her family. The final episode Jeanie appeared in was the sixth episode of season six, which was entitled \"The Peace of Wild Things\" in November 1999. She left with a standing offer from Kerry Weaver to return to County and her old job. However, she never returned to work at County.\n\nIn the Season 14 episode \"Status Quo\", Jeanie Boulet briefly returned to the ER after 8 years in January 2008 when her son Carlos suffers a head injury during Physical Education class. Initially it is believed that he is fine; however, a CT Scan revealed that he had a growth on his brain. This is customarily a sign that HIV infection has progressed into an AIDS condition. Boulet didn't find any of her old colleagues she knew (like her friend Dr. Kerry Weaver) working there anymore and was only identified by Nurses Haleh Adams and Chuny Marquez. After initially having difficulty adjusting to the changes in her former workplace she permitted full treatment and came to support the decisions of the new staff of the ER—including new Attending Dr. Gregory Pratt with whom she initially had difficulty agreeing. It was partly because of her return and inspiration that Dr. Pratt was convinced to continue his job at County, as he had earlier given his two weeks notice of resignation when the hospital board dismissed his efforts to take on a leadership role in the ER.\n\nIn the time between her last appearance and return Jeanie and her husband Reggie have undergone a separation and have joint custody of their son. Jeanie also remains a counselor for young people with HIV Status. Her clinics—one on the North side of Chicago and another on the South—have become her personal mission and her time-consuming commitment to them contributed to the end of her marriage. She reveals to Pratt that her son helps to drive her and her cause to help others with HIV infection and that she doesn't know how she will cope if he were to die. She also reveals that her ex-husband Al died two years earlier from his HIV/AIDS condition, severely emaciated to a weight of only 78 pounds and apparently demented as he was unable to even recognize her.\n\nJeanie Boulet's return to the series as a guest character in 2008 was well received by television critics. A reviewer from \"New York Entertainment\" commented that her return was like a \"welcome throwback to the days when it seemed like every episode forced Jeanie to process some piece of world-shattering news.\" The return storyline was described as a \"classic Jeanie Boulet moment, as filtered through the show's new blunt-instrument writers [...] it was like it was 1995 all over again.\" Discussing Reuben's portrayal of the character, the reviewer said, \"There's always been great pleasure in Reuben's beautiful, open face in moments like that; she played those scenes to the hilt, creating in us a great sympathy for her character [...] We couldn't stand to watch her suffer so, but we couldn't stop watching her suffer, and we died a little with every hurt the producers hit her with.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the program-makers' decision to give Jeanie HIV was an attempt to draw attention to the illness to the black community, particularly black women. Jeanie — like the majority of female AIDS cases in America at the time in 1997 — was black, heterosexual, and acquired HIV from a long-term partner. However, it has been noted that some viewers may have been offended that out of all the sexually active characters in their serial, Jeanie — whose private life had not been extensively portrayed at that point — contracted the virus.\n\nAspects of the HIV storyline have been criticized, specifically that little airtime was dedicated to dramatizing clinical procedures determining whether Jeanie had been exposed to HIV. When Jeanie discovered that her husband had AIDS in the second season finale, Jeanie has a blood test and sends it off for analysis to see if she also had the virus; however, viewers were not shown the multiple clinical procedures involved in the testing, and the following episodes concentrated on post-test rituals.\n"}

She successfully sued the state of New York for wrongful conviction.\n\nDeJac's daughter Crystallynn Girard, 13, died near midnight on February 13, 1993, or in the early hours of February 14. She was found naked on her bed and medical examiner ruled that she had been strangled. Crystallynn had cocaine in her system, but the medical examiner determined it was not enough to kill her.\n\nThe night of Crystallynn's death, DeJac and her boyfriend of two months, Dennis Donohue, went to a bar and had a large fight, after DeJac discovered he had paid someone to have her followed. DeJac told the police that Donohue had stalked her and murdered her daughter. Another man, Wayne Hudson, who had a history of criminal offenses, claimed that DeJac confessed to him that she had murdered her daughter. Donohue was given immunity to testify against DeJac after he passed a polygraph test. During the trial, prosecutors attacked DeJac's troubled past, which included having Crystallynn when she was just 16, promiscuity and a drinking problem.\n\nIn April 1994, DeJac was convicted of second-degree murder for her daughter's death and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. According to her lawyer, she had been convicted of the murder of her daughter based primarily on evidence from a neighbor who claimed DeJac had confessed the murder. There was no physical or forensic evidence implicating DeJac. DeJac was pregnant with twin boys during the trial and gave birth in jail, and later married their father, Chuck Peters, while still in prison. Prison officials did not allow her any visitation with her newborn children because she continued to proclaim her innocence.\n\nDeJac caught a break when Detective Dennis Delano moved to the Buffalo homicide division and began investigating cold cases. He reviewed the unsolved case of Joan Giambra, who in September 1993 was murdered and her 11-year-old daughter nearly killed, strangled and left for dead on top of her mother's body. Another cold case, the 1975 murder of Carol Reed, was also similar. Like Crystallynn, Reed and Giambra were found naked on their backs, strangled. Additionally, all three were connected to Donohue. Donohue and Reed lived in the same apartment building at the time of her death in 1975, and Giambra had casually dated Donohue before breaking up with him shortly before her murder.\n\nIn 2007, Hudson recanted his testimony that DeJac had confessed to Crystallynn's murder, but he was seen as an unreliable witness. At the same time, however, new forensic analysis revealed the presence of Donohue's DNA at the crime scenes for both Crystallynn and Giambra.\n\nOn November 28, 2007, DeJac conviction was overturned based on the physical evidence linking the murder to Dennis Donohue. Donohue cannot be tried for the death of Crystallynn Girard, however, as he was granted immunity at her trial. In September 2007, he was arrested for Giambra's murder, 13 years after her death. In May 2008, a jury took only six hours to convict him for Giambra's murder. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nAccording to the Innocence Project, DeJac is the first woman to be exonerated of murdering someone on the basis of DNA evidence. A previous case had involved the reversal of the conviction of Paula Grey, who had been convicted as an accomplice to murder, but was cleared when the conviction of the principals was reversed.\n\nNevertheless the Erie County prosecutor was quoted as saying he planned to retry DeJac for second-degree manslaughter. Later, the prosecutor dropped the case after consulting with a new forensic pathologist, who announced that Crystallynn had died of a cocaine overdose. Both Detective Delano and DeJac were outraged and insisted that Crystallynn was murdered by Donohue, and that the trace amounts of cocaine found could have been transferred by Donohue during her murder. \"My daughter was murdered,\" DeJac said. \"There's no question my daughter was murdered.\" \n\nDeJac's lawyer, Steven M. Cohen represented DeJac in her civil suit against the state of New York and secured a $2.7 million settlement. They also filed a $30 million federal lawsuit against Erie County and the city of Buffalo. A journalist for \"The Buffalo News\" commented, \"The district attorney's office — in a monumental blunder — granted lifetime immunity to Donohue, who should have been a prime suspect. Instead, DeJac was arrested, convicted and wrongfully imprisoned for 14 years in her daughter's strangulation.\"\n\nOne month after DeJac received her $2.7 million settlement, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. On June 18, 2014, DeJac died at her home in Buffalo, aged 50. She was survived by her husband and three children. According to her attorney and family, the federal lawsuit Erie County and the city of Buffalo is going forward.\n\n"}

Rey created from 1939 to 1966.\n\nMargarete Elisabethe Waldstein was born in 1906 in Hamburg, the daughter of Gertrude (Rosenfeld) and Felix Waldstein. Her father was a member of the Reichstag. She studied art at Bauhaus in Dessau,\n\nWhile in Paris, Hans's animal drawings came to the attention of French publisher, who commissioned him to write a children's book. The result, \"Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys\", is little remembered today, but one of its characters, an adorably impish monkey named Curious George, was such a success that the couple considered writing a book just about him. Their work was interrupted with the outbreak of World War II. As Jews, the Reys decided to flee Paris before the Nazis seized the city. Hans built two bicycles, and they fled Paris just a few hours before it fell. Among the meager possessions they brought with them was the illustrated manuscript of \"Curious George\".\n\nThe Reys' odyssey brought them to the Spanish border, where they bought train tickets to Lisbon. From there they returned to Brazil, where they had met five years earlier, but this time they continued to New York City. The books were published by \nHoughton Mifflin in 1941, though certain changes had to be introduced because of the technology of the time. Hans and Margret originally planned to use watercolors to illustrate the books, but since they were responsible for the color separation, he changed these to the cartoon-like images that continue to feature in each of the books. (A collector's edition with the original watercolors was released in 1998.)\n\n\"Curious George\" was an instant success, and the Reys were commissioned to write more adventures of the mischievous monkey and his friend, the Man with the Yellow Hat. They wrote seven stories in all, with Hans mainly doing the illustrations and Margret working mostly on the stories, though they both admitted to sharing the work and cooperating fully in every stage of development. At first, however, Margret's name was left off the cover, ostensibly because there was a glut of women already writing children's fiction. In later editions, this was corrected, and Margret now receives full credit for her role in developing the stories.\n\nMargret and her husband moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1963, in a house close to Harvard Square. Following her husband's death in 1977, Margret continued writing, and in 1979 she became a Professor of Creative Writing at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. From 1980 she collaborated with Alan Shalleck on a series of short films featuring Curious George and on more than two dozen additional books.\n\nIn 1989 Margret Rey established the Curious George Foundation to help creative children and prevent cruelty to animals. In 1996, she made major donations to the Boston Public Library and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. She was also a long-time supporter of the Longy School of Music.\n\nRey died of a heart attack on December 21, 1996.\n\nThe de Grummond Children's Literature Collection in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, holds more than 300 boxes of Rey papers dated 1973 to 2002.\n\nDr. Lena Y. de Grummond, a professor in the field of library science at The University of Southern Mississippi, contacted the Reys in 1966 about USM's new children's literature collection. H. A. and Margret donated a pair of sketches at the time. When Margret Rey died in 1996, her will designated that the entire literary estate of the Reys would be donated to the de Grummond Collection.\n\n"}
{"id": "948439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=948439", "title": "Mazdak", "text": "Mazdak\n\nMazdak (, Middle Persian: 𐭬𐭦𐭣𐭪, also Mazdak the Younger; died c. 524 or 528) was a Zoroastrian \"mobad\" (priest), Iranian reformer, prophet and religious activist who gained influence during the reign of the Sasanian emperor Kavadh I. He claimed to be a prophet of Ahura Mazda and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs. He has been seen as a proto-socialist.\n\nMazdak was the chief representative of a religious and philosophical teaching called Mazdakism, which he viewed as a reformed and purified version of Zoroastrianism, although his teaching has been argued to display influences from Manichaeism as well. Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion of Sassanid Persia, and Mazdak himself was a mobad or Zoroastrian priest, but most of the clergy regarded his teaching as heresy. Information about it is scarce and details are sketchy, but some further details may be inferred from the later doctrine of the Khurramites, which has been seen as a continuation of Mazdakism.\n\nSome sources claim that the original founders of this sect lived earlier than Mazdak. These were another mobad, Zaradust-e Khuragen (distinct from the founder of Zoroastrianism, Zoroaster, Middle Persian \"Zardusht\") and/or a Zoroastrian philosopher known as Mazdak the Elder, who taught a combination of altruism and hedonism: \"he directed his followers to enjoy the pleasures of life and satisfy their appetite in the highest degree with regard to eating and drinking in the spirit of equality, to aim at good deeds; to abstain from shedding blood and inflicting harm on others; and to practise hospitality without reservation\". This doctrine was further developed by the much better-known Mazdak the Younger, son of Bāmdād.\n\nAt later stages the conservative Zoroastrian opposition accused Mazdak's followers of heresy and with abhorrent practices such as the sharing of women, for which scholars have found no evidence. Mazdak's followers are considered to be the first real socialists in human history by their emphasis on community property and community work with benefits accruing to all.\n\nLike both Zoroastrianism (at least as practised at the time) and Manichaeism, Mazdakism had a dualistic cosmology and worldview. This doctrine taught that there were two original principles of the universe: Light, the good one; and Darkness, the evil one. These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, tainting everything except God. Light is characterized by knowledge and feeling, and acts by design and free will, whereas Darkness is ignorant and blind, and acts at random. Mankind's role in this life was, through good conduct, to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. But where Manichaeism saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.\n\nIn addition, Mazdakism is reported, in one late work, to have distinguished three elements (Fire, Water, Earth), and four Powers (Discernment, Understanding, Preservation and Joy, corresponding to the four chief officials of the Sassanid state – the Chief Mobad (\"Mobadan Mobad\"), the Chief Herbad, the Commander of the Army and the Entertainment Master), seven Viziers and twelve Spiritual Forces. When the Four, the Seven and the Twelve were united in a human being, he was no longer subject to religious duties. In addition, God was believed to rule the world through letters, which held the key to the Great Secret that should be learned. This description suggests that Mazdakism was, in many ways, a typical Gnostic sect.\n\nTwo distinguishing factors of Mazdak's teaching were the reduction of the importance of religious formalities—the true religious person being the one who understood and related correctly to the principles of the universe—and a criticism of the strong position of mainstream clergy, who, he believed, had oppressed the Persian population and caused much poverty.\n\nMazdak emphasised good conduct, which involved a moral and ascetic life, no killing and vegetarianism (considering meat to contain substances derived solely from Darkness), being kind and friendly and living in peace with other people.\n\nIn many ways Mazdak's teaching can be understood as a call for social revolution, and has been referred to as early \"communism\". He and his followers were also advocates of free love.\n\nAccording to Mazdak, God had originally placed the means of subsistence on earth so that people should divide them among themselves equally, but the strong had coerced the weak, seeking domination and causing the contemporary inequality. This in turn empowered the \"Five Demons\" that turned men from Righteousness – these were Envy, Wrath, Vengeance, Need and Greed. To prevail over these evils, justice had to be restored and everybody should share excess possessions with his fellow men. Mazdak allegedly planned to achieve this by making all wealth common or by re-distributing the excess, although it is unclear how he intended to organize that in terms of regulations and to what extent his position has been caricatured by hostile sources. The hostile sources mostly dwell on the alleged \"sharing\" of women, the resulting sexual promiscuity and the confusion of the line of descent. Since the latter is a standard accusation against heretical sects, its veracity has been doubted by researchers; it is likely that Mazdak took measures against the widespread polygamy of the rich and lack of wives for the poor.\n\nMazdak's teaching acquired many followers, to the point when even King Kavadh I, ruling from 488 until 531, converted to Mazdakism. He also reportedly sponsored its adoption by the Arab vassal kingdom of al-Hirah, entailing the deposing of the previous king al-Mundhir by the Kindite chief al-Harith.\n\nWith the King's backing Mazdak could embark on a program of social reform, which involved pacifism, anti-clericalism and aid programs for helping the poor. Mazdak had government warehouses opened to help the poor. He also had all the Zoroastrian fire temples closed except the three major ones.\n\nFear among the nobility and Zoroastrian clergy grew so strong that King Kavadh was overthrown in 496, but he managed to regain the throne three years later with the help of the Hephthalite Empire.\nScared by the resistance among the powerful, he chose to distance himself from Mazdak. He allowed Anushiravan to launch a campaign against the Mazdakites in 524 or 528, culminating in a massacre of most of the adherents – including Mazdak himself – and restoring orthodox Zoroastrianism as the state religion. Various fictionalized accounts specify the manner of execution: for example, the \"Shahnameh\" states that 3000 Mazdakites were buried alive with the feet upwards in order to present Mazdak with the spectacle of a \"human garden\", whereas Mazdak himself was hanged upside down and shot with countless arrows; other stories specify other torturous methods of execution. Anushiravan then proceeded to implement his own far-reaching social and administrative reforms. The Mazdakite ruler of al-Hirah was also overthrown and the previous king restored to power.\n\nA Jewish tradition relates a slightly different story. The Exilarch of Babylon, Mar-Zutra II, rallied the Jewish community and their allies, who defeated Mazdak and established an independent Jewish kingdom in Mahoza that lasted for seven years \n(495–502).\n\nA few Mazdakis survived, and settled in remote areas. Small pockets of Mazdakite societies are said to have survived for centuries after the Muslim conquest of Persia. Their doctrines probably mixed with radical currents of Shia Islam, influencing them and giving rise to later powerful revolutionary-religious movements in the region. The cult of al-Muqanna‘, who claimed to be the incarnation of God and had followers among the Mubaiyyidah sect of Zoroastrianism and even some Turks, upheld the laws and institutes of Mazdak. In the 9th century, the Khurramites, an egalitarian religious sect possibly originating from Mazdakism, led a revolt under the leadership of Babak Khorramdin against the Abbasid Caliphate and successfully defended large territories against the Caliphate's forces for some twenty years. The Batiniyya, Qarmatians and other later revolutionary currents of Islam may also be connected to Mazdakism and were often equated with it by contemporary authors.\n\nTurkish scholar Abdülbâkî Gölpınarlı sees even the Qizilbash of the 16th century – a radical Shi'i movement in Persia which helped the Safaviyya establish Twelver Islam as the dominant religion of Iran – as \"spiritual descendants of the Khurramites\" and, hence, of the Mazdakites. \"Mazdakist\" eventually seems to have become a standard derogative label attached by pre-modern Persian and Arabic authors to any radical egalitarian movement in subsequent Iranian history. While medieval Muslim historiography primarily focused on the \"socialist\" aspects of Mazdak, Zoroastrian tradition, on the other hand, remembers Mazdak above all as a dangerous heretic and enemy of the true faith (\"Zand-i Wahman yasn\" 2:1), a threat comparable to Mani and Muhammad (\"Denkard\" 3:345).\n\nThe author of the \"Dabestan-e Mazaheb\", writing as late as the 17th century, claims to have met individual adherents of Mazdakism who practised their religion secretly among the Muslims and preserved the \"Desnad\", a book in Middle Persian containing the teachings of Mazdak.\n\n\n\n"}

He left school aged 14 or 15 and obtained employment at a clothes stall, later moving on to teach cooking lessons at his local soup kitchen.\n\nIn 1987 Peter Bryan lived in the Flying Angel, Custom House, East London. It was here that he attempted to throw another resident from his sixth floor window. There was a struggle and his intended victim escaped, leaving Bryan with a deep gash to the head.

He began playing music at an early age, starting with piano at age four, guitar at age ten, then learning both drums and bass guitar at 15. Attempts to find like-minded musicians in and around San Pedro became frustrating, and by 1982 Derrick began spending more time in Los Angeles, performing in various musical settings.\n\nIn 1984 Derrick became roommates with Minutemen singer/guitarist D. Boon, and they began playing together informally with Crane, who played trumpet and sang on a few Minutemen records. The trio called themselves \"Cosmic Joke\", but public performance was limited to two private parties.\n\nDerrick and Crane continued performing together, and in 1987, after several attempts with different musicians, they began working as a duo under the name \"Another Umbrella\", which utilized extended delay guitar loops, pre-recorded instruments, slide shows, and a strong emphasis on improvisation. This went against the grain of what was popular in Los Angeles clubs at the time, but they did perform regularly around town and on radio, most notably at The Museum Of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles. Other musicians who performed with Another Umbrella include keyboardist Paul Roessler and flutist/vocalist Emily Hay.\n\nIn 1997, two weeks after the final Another Umbrella show, Derrick began performing with drummer Bob Lee and a core of revolving musicians (including Nels Cline and Joe Baiza) under the name \"Solo Career\", a side-project which lasted until 2002, performing whenever the musicians' schedules allowed.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1994 Derrick produced concerts in Los Angeles for Canterbury Scene musicians Kevin Ayers, Richard Sinclair, Gilli Smyth and Tim Blake. In 1998 and 2000 Derrick organized and financed two California mini-tours with Ayers, eventually releasing the best of this material on the \"Alive In California\" CD through his own Box-O-Plenty Records.\n\nDerrick has also released the best of the home recordings with Boon as \"D. Boon and Friends\", as well as the sole album by Solo Career, \"Season Finale\", which features artwork by British artist Paul Whitehead (best known for his art on the Genesis albums \"Foxtrot\", \"Trespass\" and \"Nursery Cryme\").\n\nIn 2005 Derrick began to experience symptoms of what was eventually diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, most likely as the result of head injuries sustained during an assault at a San Pedro record store in 1990. With most of the flexibility in his left-hand fingers now gone, he is unable to play guitar, bass or drums at his former level. As he was still able to play basic guitar chords, he joined several friends from the Los Angeles music scene to perform a tribute to Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett, which they called A Room Of Musical Tunes. A one-off performance in September 2006 was eventually followed by two performances in May 2007 and January 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, Derrick went through his entire recording archive and edited the highlights for posterity, ending up with 70 hours of music. The first of these recordings to be publicly available are seven hours of music (spread out over eleven albums) by Another Umbrella, released exclusively on digital downloads with no discs being pressed, in March 2008.\n\nDerrick remains active on the Los Angeles music scene, although on more of a behind-the-scenes level. Derrick closed down Box-O-Plenty Records in June 2011.\n"}

He became a Canadian journalist and civil servant. In the latter role he served as the Commissioner of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in the 1940s, having previously been instrumental in the foundation of the Board the previous decade.\n\nIn the 1920s McLean studied at Brandon College, and then later at the University of Manitoba. After gaining his MA from Manitoba in 1927, he won a Rhodes Scholarship to Balliol College at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. After completing his academic career in 1931, he moved to work in the United States, for the Unemployment Relief Commission of Northern Illinois. In 1932 he returned to Canada, working for the Association of Canadian Clubs and also engaging in a journalistic career. He wrote for \"Saturday Night\" and \"Canadian Forum\" magazines, and in 1935 became the National Liberal Federation's editor of publications.\n\nIn 1936 he was appointed the personal secretary to the Canadian High Commissioner the United Kingdom, Vincent Massey. In 1938 Massey and McLean discussed how unimpressed they were by the standard of films produced by the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau. McLean had seen and admired the work of British documentary film-maker John Grierson, and suggested to Massey that he should persuade the Canadian government to allow Grierson to compile a report into its film-making activities. This report led, in 1939, to the formation of the new National Film Board, with Grierson in charge.\n\nIn the same year that the NFB was established, Grierson hired McLean to serve under him as the Assistant Film Commissioner. After arguments with the government over the content of several films, Grierson resigned his position as Government Film Commissioner in 1945. During the turbulent postwar years, McLean succeeded Grierson as Commissioner, initially on an interim basis but from January 1947 as an official appointment. McLean was faced with several problems during his time in charge, including budget cuts, a reduction in staffing and conflicts with the dominant United States film industry.\n\nMcLean's greatest problem, however, came from the government's fear of communism within the NFB. In an atmosphere of heightening Cold War tensions with a government minister suggesting that certain NFB employees were engaged in Communist activities, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation was instigated into communism at the Board. Several employees were deemed \"security risks\", but following the findings of the investigation, McLean refused to fire any staff members. He believed that the political beliefs of his staff were irrelevant as long as it did not interfere with their work. In December 1949, McLean was informed that his contract would not be renewed when it expired in January. Ralph Foster, then assistant commissioner, resigned in protest. Several other members of McLean's staff threatened to resign as well, but he dissuaded them from doing so as he did not want the NFB to be harmed.\n\nMcLean's nephew, Grant McLean, had begun working as a film director at the NFB during his uncle's time there. Grant, whose own NFB career spanned nearly three decades, described his uncle as a very philosophic person who believed very much in the concept of film and public information. He went on to serve as interim Commissioner himself during the 1960s.\n\nIn 1950, McLean moved to Paris with his wife and young son to head the film division at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a position he was to hold until 1957. He returned to Canada as a writer and broadcaster, contributing to a number of publications. Then in 1960 he assumed the post of research director at the Broadcast Board of Governors which later became the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), where he eventually took on the role of special policy advisor, a post he was to hold until he retired in 1973.\n\nRoss married Beverley Bell Cosh and they had two children, Digby and Yolande.\n\nIn an interview with the Toronto Star, Digby was reported as saying that his father was intensely nationalistic, and that he was perhaps best known for having stood up to U.S. film interests during his NFB tenure. Yolande remarked that her father loved history, read voraciously and travelled widely, sometimes forgetting to tell his family his next destination. Fluent in several languages, Mr McLean taught himself French by translating the Bible. In later life, McLean suffered from Alzheimer's disease.

They practiced their profession in the seaport of Aegeae, then in the Roman province of Syria.\n\nAccepting no payment for their services led to them being named \"Anargyroi\" (from the Greek Ανάργυροι, \"the silverless\" or \"Unmercenaries\"); it has been said that, by this, they attracted many to the Christian faith.\n\nNothing is known of their lives except that they suffered martyrdom in Syria during the persecution of the Emperor Diocletian. \nAccording to Christian traditions, the twin brothers were born in Arabia and became skilled doctors.\n\nSaladino d'Ascoli, a 15th century Italian physician, claims that the medieval electuary, a pasty mass consisting of a drug mixed with sugar and water or honey suitable for oral administration, known as opopira, a complex compound medicine used to treat diverse maladies including paralysis, was invented by Cosmas and Damian.\n\nDuring the persecution under Diocletian, Cosmas and Damian were arrested by order of the Prefect of Cilicia, one Lysias who is otherwise unknown, who ordered them under torture to recant. However, according to legend they stayed true to their faith, enduring being hung on a cross, stoned and shot by arrows and finally suffered execution by beheading. Anthimus, Leontius and Euprepius, their younger brothers, who were inseparable from them throughout life, shared in their martyrdom.\n\nAs early as the 4th century, churches dedicated to the twin saints were established at Jerusalem, in Egypt and in Mesopotamia. Devotion to the two saints spread rapidly in both East and West. Theodoret records the division of their reputed relics. Their relics, deemed miraculous, were buried in the city of Cyrrus in Syria. Churches were built in their honor by Archbishop Proclus and by Emperor Justinian I (527–565), who sumptuously restored the city of Cyrus and dedicated it to the twins, but brought their purported relics to Constantinople; there, following his cure, ascribed to the intercession of Cosmas and Damian, Justinian, in gratitude also built and adorned their church at Constantinople, and it became a celebrated place of pilgrimage. At Rome Pope Felix IV (526–530) rededicated the Library of Peace (\"Bibliotheca Pacis\") as a basilica of Santi Cosma e Damiano in the Forum of Vespasian in their honour. The church is much rebuilt but still famed for its sixth-century mosaics illustrating the saints.\n\nWhat are said to be their skulls are venerated in the convent of the Clares in Madrid, where they have been since 1581, the gift of Maria, daughter of Emperor Charles V. They had previously been removed from Rome to Bremen in the tenth century, and thence to Bamberg. \nOther skulls said to be theirs were discovered in 1334 by Burchard Grelle, Archbishop of Bremen. He \"personally 'miraculously' retrieved the relics of the holy physicians Cosmas and Damian, which were allegedly immured and forgotten in the choir of the Bremen Cathedral. In celebration of the retrieval Archbishop and Chapter arranged a feast at Pentecost 1335, when the relics were translated from the wall to a more dignified place. Grelle claimed the relics were those Archbishop Adaldag brought from Rome in 965. The cathedral master-builder Johann Hemeling made a shrine for the relics, which was finished around 1420. The shrine,made from carved oak wood covered with gilt and rolled silver is considered an important mediaeval gold work. In 1649 Bremen's Chapter, Lutheran by this time, sold the shrine without the heads to Maximilian I of Bavaria. The two heads remained in Bremen and came into the possession of the small Roman Catholic community. They were shown from 1934 to 1968 in the Church of St. Johann and in 1994 they were buried in the crypt. The shrine is now shown in the Jesuit church of St Michael in Munich. At least since 1413 another supposed pair of skulls of the saints has been stored in St Stephens's Cathedral in Vienna. Other relics are claimed by the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice.\n\nThe martyr twins are invoked in the Canon of the Mass in the prayer known as the \"Communicantes\" (from the first Latin word of the prayer): \"In communion with the whole Church, they venerate above all others the memory of the glorious ever-virgin Mary, Mother of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ, then of blessed Joseph, husband of the Virgin, your blessed Apostles and Martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, ...John and Paul, \"Cosmas and Damian\" and all your Saints: grant through their merits and prayers that in all things we may be defended by the help of your protection.\" They are also invoked in the Litany of the Saints, and in the older form of the Roman rite, in the Collect for Thursday in the Third Week of Lent, as the station church for this day is Santi Cosma e Damiano.\n\nTheir feast day in the General Roman Calendar, which had been on September 27, was moved in 1969 to September 26, because September 27 is the \"dies natalis\" (\"day of birth\" into Heaven) of Saint Vincent de Paul, now more widely venerated in the Latin Church. In Canada it has been moved to Sept. 25 (as Sept. 26 is the Feast of the Canadian Martyrs in Canada).\n\nSts Cosmas and Damian are regarded as the patrons of physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists and are sometimes represented with medical emblems.\n\nIn Brazil, the twin saints are regarded as protectors of children, and September 27 is commemorated, especially in Rio de Janeiro, by giving children bags of candy with the saints' effigy printed on them and throughout the entire state of Bahia where Catholics and adepts of Candomblé religion offer typical food such as caruru.\nThe ritual consists of first offering the food to seven children that are no older than seven years old and then having them feast while sitting on the floor and eating with their hands. Only after all children have finished can the guests enjoy the food that is being offered. The Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, in Igarassu, Pernambuco is Brazil's oldest church, built in 1535.\n\nIn the UK St Damian is the dexter side supporter in the coat of arms of the British Dental Association.\n\nSts. Cosmas & Damian are venerated every year in Utica, New York at St. Anthony's Parish during the annual pilgrimage which takes place on the last weekend of September (close to the Sept. 27 feast day). There are thousands of pilgrims who come to honor the saints. Over 80 busloads come from Canada and other destinations. The 2-day festival includes music (La Banda Rosa), much Italian food, masses and processions through the streets of East Utica. It is one of the largest festivals honoring saints in the northeast USA.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Eastern Catholic Churches, and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Saints Cosmas and Damian are venerated as a type of saint known as Unmercenary Physicians (, \"anargyroi,\" \"without money\"). This classification of saints is unique to the Eastern Church and refers to those who heal purely out of love for God and man, strictly observing the command of Jesus: \"Freely have you received, freely give.\" («Δωρεὰν ἐλάβετε, δωρεὰν δότε...» ) While each of the Unmercenaries has his own feast days, all are commemorated together on the first Sunday in November, in a feast known as the Synaxis of the Unmercenary Physicians.\n\nThe Orthodox celebrate no less than three different sets of saints by the name of Cosmas and Damian, each with their own distinct feast day:\n\n\nOrthodox icons of the saints depict them vested as laymen holding medicine boxes. Often each will also hold a spoon with which to dispense medicine. The handle of the spoon is normally shaped like a cross to indicate the importance of spiritual as well as physical healing, and that all cures come from God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Church of England, dedications of churches to SS Cosmas and Damian are very rare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Orthodox Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Futog\n\n\n\n\n"}

Khalil began his activism in 2000 as part of the Egyptian anti-war and anti-globalisation movement. He believes that political reform is rooted in the anti-war and Palestine solidarity movements. He also believes that dictatorship leads to imperialism.\n\nHe was a protester from the Egyptian opposition movement Kefaya. He also co-founded the 20 March Popular Campaign for Change.\n\nIn 2006 he criticized Egyptian police after at Sudanese refugees were killed at a squatter camp in Cairo. He said, \"When you kill little babies, things have changed...We will try you, and you won't be able to travel abroad again.\"\n\nIn September 2010 Khalil reported on an altered photograph in Al-Ahram in which editors had changed the position of president Hosni Mubarak from the back of a row of heads of state to the front.

In an editorial in \"The Guardian\", Khalil's criticisms of the SCAF focused on rumors about pardoning Mubarak and members of his regime, physical or violent reactions of security forces during protests, the army's use of military trials against civilians, use of trials against protesters and 'normal citizens', and he also noted the prior successes which resulted from large protests in Tahrir Square. He wrote, \"The call for a 'second revolution' chimes with a growing restlessness and impatience at the pace of developments and the overall performance of the governing Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)...We will be out again in Tahrir Square on Friday 27 May in order to assert that the interim power respect our rights and demands. The Egyptian people have earned their right to control the future of this country.\"\n\nIn July 2011 Al-Ahram profiled Khalil's presence at a meeting with Prime Minister Essam Sharaf, along with four other activists, which prompted a debate on Twitter about whether or not the activists represented to growing protests. Seven demands, agreed upon by several organisations, were presented to Sharaf. The meeting happened while in Tahrir square protesters gathered in their second major wave of activism.\n\nIn a June 2011 editorial in \"The Guardian\", Khalil criticized support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which included a $3 billion loan. He said, \"But many people, myself included, were unhappy with this news and the impact such a loan will have on deepening the country's debt and mounting debt servicing burden.\" Khalil equated help from the bank with \"neoliberal[ism]\", \"imperialism\", and the politics of the Mubarak regime. He blamed such policies for economic stagnation, deterioration, and growing inequality under Mubarak. Khalil cited IMF ex-employee and Mubarak regime finance minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who was sentenced to prison for corruption. He said, \"I believe that this country's future lies not with the same highly paid, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats of the IMF, nor with their sacred indicators of budget deficits and market economics. Our future lies with a new home-grown economics that caters for the majority of Egyptians, the schools where their children are educated, the hospitals where they receive healthcare, and the jobs that guarantee them decent and honourable living.\"\n\nIn July 2011, Khalil criticized a proposed increase in Egypt's minimum wage as insufficiently large. Khalil said the new wage, while \"an improvement\" represented an \"example of the priority of the government to lean on the poor and working majority in order to protect the interests of businessmen and the established elite.\"\n\nKhalil also supported the proposed budget's decreasing of the deficit but criticized the means to do so which he said put more burden on workers and pensioners rather than raising capital gains taxes. Khalil said, \"We need to continue mass demonstrations to pressure the government, [because] it won’t stop with just the budget and the decision on minimum wage, but they will continue leaning on workers, on the country’s weakest side.\"\n\nKhalil argued that in the movement for reform social rights were necessary as well as political rights. He said, \"We must not only mobilize people, but also debate and explain specifically why social justice is important for [Egypt]. You cannot really say that you want democracy, and then after that you’ll [work to] get social justice. No. If you do it in this order, you’ll end up with nothing.\"\n\n\n"}

On March 8, 2007, \"The Fiji Times ONLINE\" described Fijian women as playing an important role in the fields of economic and social development in Fijian society. The women of the Republic of Fiji are the \"driving force\" in health service as nurses and medical doctors. They are also key players and managers in the tourism and entertainment industries, as well as teachers in the field of education.\n\nAccording to the article \"Women's work and fertility in Fiji\", \"the presence of very young children and larger family sizes contribute to the low level of labour force participation of Fijian and Indian women in Fiji.\" By culture and tradition, a woman in Fiji lives in a paternalistic and patriarchal society wherein she has a secondary role at home performing household chores that include cooking meals and cleaning the house. As community and village members women are treated as subservient to men.\n\nBy tradition, most of the cooking is performed by Fijian women. Indo-Fijian cuisine may include food made from starch and involves the use of relishes made from vegetables. If available, meat and fish are also eaten. Flatbread may be made from locally grown rice or from imported flour. Traditional Indo-Fijian eating custom requires that women eat separately from men. For religious reasons Hindu Indo-Fijians avoid consuming beef and Muslim Indo-Fijians avoid consuming pork.\n\nViolence against women in Fiji is recognised to be \"pervasive, widespread and a serious national issue\" in the Pacific Island region. Fiji's rates of violence against women are \"among the very highest in the world\". The Fiji Women's Crisis Centre reports that 64% of women who have been in intimate relationships have experienced physical or sexual violence from their partner, including 61% who were physically attacked and 34% who were sexually abused.\n\nThe 2006 Fijian coup d'état created conditions which exacerbated the presence of violence against women in Fijian society, especially in the public sector. Conventional attitudes about the place of women in Fijian society perpetuate the normalisation of violence against women and permeate extended family groups, the local authorities and the judiciary. Customary and religious practices like \"bulubulu\" (forgiveness ceremonies) deal with domestic violence cases within the family, usually either precluding prosecution for the perpetrator or reducing their sentence.\n\n\n"}

He served under a succession of French governments including the \"ancien regime\" monarchy, the Revolutionary governments, the Restorations, the July Monarchy, the First and Second Republics, and the First Empire (and arguably the Second), becoming Prime Minister briefly in 1834.\n\nBorn at Damvilliers, in Lorraine, he joined a battalion of volunteers in 1791, and served in the campaigns of 1792–1793 under Generals Charles François Dumouriez and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. In 1795, he served Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte as aide-de-camp. In 1799 he was promoted \"chef d'escadron\", and in 1800 colonel.\n\nHe distinguished himself at the battles of Austerlitz and Jena, and was made Brigadier General in November 1806, and for his conduct in the battle of Wagram he was created a baron of the First French Empire.\n\nIn the Spanish campaign of 1810 and 1811, Gérard gained special distinction at the battle of Fuentes de Onoro; and in the expedition to Russia he was present at the battle of Smolensk and the battle of Valutino, and displayed such bravery and ability in the battle of Borodino that he was made \"général de division\". He won further distinction in the disastrous retreat from Moscow.\n\nIn the campaign of 1813, in command of a division, he took part in the battle of Lützen and the battle of Bautzen, as well as in the operations of Marshal Macdonald, and at the battle of Leipzig (in which he commanded the XI Corps) he was gravely wounded. After the battle of Bautzen, he was created by Napoleon a count of the Empire.\nIn the Six Days Campaign of 1814, and especially at La Rothière and the battle of Montereau, he won still greater distinction.\n\nAfter the first Bourbon Restoration, he was named by King Louis XVIII Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor and chevalier of St Louis.\n\nDuring the Hundred Days, Napoleon made Gérard a Peer of France and placed him in command of the IV Corps of the Army of the North. In this capacity Gérard took a brilliant part in the battle of Ligny, and on the morning of 18 June he was foremost in advising Marshal Grouchy to march to the sound of the guns to aid the emperor at Waterloo.
