In 2015, Wu came out as Neutrois on YouTube channel and started going by gender neutral pronouns, in the same year they also began advocating with Toronto's Supporting Our Youth organization.\n\nAdrienne Wu was born in Burlington, Ontario. Wu credits most of Wu's inspiration from Wu's mother Jean Carole Wu. Wu's maternal grandmother Joan Davis was the head designer of Tai Ping Carpets Hong Kong in the 1960s. Adrienne Wu attended Hillfield Strathallan College and in late 2009 Wu attended the University of Toronto aiming to go into a career of sex therapy. They dropped out after one year.\n\nAfter creating Wu's portfolio, Wu was accepted by the Istituto Marangoni, but deferred the offer to start Wu's own company in September 2010. In 2011, Adrienne Wu opened Wu's first boutique in downtown Toronto.\n\nWu learned to sew in 2009 after they dropped out of the University of Toronto. Wu's first break was being offered a position at MuchMusic in April 2010 as a Fashion Correspondent, where they worked for half a year. The same day that Wu was offered the position, they received an invitation to show their Fall Winter 2010 Collection at Vancouver Fashion Week. Wu was nineteen years old. Wu showed their very first time at Vancouver Fashion Week which kick started Wu's career as a fashion designer. Wu participated in the Spring-Summer 2011 Collection at the National Gallery of Canada during the Ottawa Fashion Week in October 2010. In the same month, Wu met Shawn Hewson of Project Runway Canada through the Alumni Association of Hillfield Strathallan College. Hewson mentored Wu for a year and introduced them to The Fashion Design Council of Canada. In 2009 artist Mehrnaz had illustrated a painting of one of Wu's earlier pieces.\n\nIn November 2010, Wu was offered their first corporate collaboration with Allan Candy. Wu was commissioned to create dresses out of Allan Candy wrappers for an online advertisement. This was the first time Allan Candy had collaborated with a fashion designer and used the advertisement to launch the candy \"DOPS\".\n\nQuickly known as the 18-year-old-boy who modelled their own dresses, Prestel published Adrienne Wu internationally in a book called Style Diaries in February 2011. Wu was featured as \"one of the most influential forces behind tomorrow's trends\" – Simone Werle. Style Diaries was distributed in over 50 countries.\n\nIn March 2011, R&B singer Keisha Chante modelled Adrienne Wu's dress in the Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show. Wu's work was featured after at Textile Museum of Canada as a part of Canada's first Fashion Exhibition, called Dare to Wear Love, in support of The Stephen Lewis Foundation.\n\nAt twenty-one, Wu debuted their Spring-Summer 2012 Collection at Toronto Fashion Week titled \"Creatures of the Photons\" with dresses resembling \"large testicles and penis shapes jutting\". See below for controversial links. Wu has been critiqued as having \"remarkable silhouettes\" quoted by The Ottawa Citizen. Huffington Post said Wu had \"dramatic and breathtaking designs.\" Wu was also quoted as being \"a fashion wunderkind\" by both Ottawa Citizen and Toronto Star.\n\nWu had the opportunity to collaborate with Margaret Atwood for the Book Lovers Ball, hosted in support of the Toronto Public Library in January 2012. Wu created designs inspired by Margaret Atwood's book \"In Other Worlds\". Margaret tweeted that Adrienne Wu is \"a brilliant designer\". In March 2012, Adrienne Wu was also involved with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada in Wu's annual event The Heart Truth Foundation. Jessi Cruikshank, eTalk's Host modeled the Heart Truth Fashion Show's opening dress. Later that month, Canada's Got Talent Host Dina Pugliese modeled Adrienne Wu's custom designed dress for the Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show. The annual Steven Lewis Foundation Fashion Show was Toronto Fashion Week's Finale show featuring the top 16 designers of Canada. Celebrity models included Jeanne Beker and Bob Marley's grand daughter, Donisha Prendergast.\n\nWu has dressed celebrities such as Jessi Cruickshank, Keshia Chante, Dina Pugliese, Kreesha Turner, and Christine Avanti.\n\nWu has been covered by various publications including \"Ottawa Citizen, \"Ottawa Life\" Magazine, Dresstokill Magazine, \"Huffington Post\", \"Hamilton Spectator\", \"Burlington Post\", \"Toronto Star\", \"The Globe and Mail\", \"The Vancouver Sun\", \"World Journal\", \"Flare\" Magazine, \"Fashion Magazine\", \"ELLE Magazine\", and the \"National Post\". [21] Wu has also been covered by such television news programs like Fashion Television, Sun News, CityTV, CBC, CTV, AChannel, eTalk, and Associated Press.\n\nWu designed a tutu for The National Ballet of Canada's 60th anniversary celebration which is to be debuted late 2012. Wu has also recently been commissioned to their second corporate collaboration recently. Wu was to create a dress out of toilet paper for Cashmere (previously known as Cottonelle). Cashmere plans to launch this collection in September 2012. Wu became a spokesperson for Perrier as an official social influencer in 2012.\n\nAfter Wu's debut at Toronto Fashion Week late 2011, Natalie Atkinson of the National Post criticized them for \"threads hanging from the seam\" and sending \"unabashedly hairy-legged boys\" down the runway. She concluded the review with \"...if Wu is earnest, I would urgently refer Wu to land an internship at Comme des Garçons or Margiela\".\nFashion Magazine called Wu 'overwrought' and Flare Magazine has said \"One of the most unforgettable shows we saw this season\".\n\nIn early 2012, Wu had their \"Hierarchy of Needs\" FW12 show at Toronto Fashion Week, which involved models wearing Guy Fawkes masks. This caused controversy quoting the Toronto Star to say, \"message baffles audience\". Wu also caught the attention of Gawker, which questioned the designer's judgment for citing the group Anonymous.\n\nIn 2015, Adrienne Wu came out to the public as neutrois, a non-binary gender identity and started going by gender-neutral pronouns. In the following year, Wu wrote an article on the Medium explaining the concept of being non-binary and how it differs greatly from other transgender identities. Wu has since openly participated in the Trans Fusion drop-ins at the Sherbourne Health Centre in Toronto, advocating for the visibility of non-binary identities within the vast spectrum of gender diversity. Wu frequently posts video updates about their transition journey on their personal YouTube channel as of 2016. In 2017, Wu changed their name to Adrienne, from Adrian.\n\nCanadian fashion ranking aggregate website Canadian-Fashion.ca rated Adrienne Wu 2 out of 5 stars for their body of work. \nFashion magazine reviewed Wu's debut collection saying it, \"...failed to impress\". It later went on to write, \"While the gowns themselves were quite striking in a palette of muted colours and constructed to Wu's signature voluminous style, it was not the focus of the audience, and apparently not that of its either. On more than a few pieces, faulty zippers and rogue hem threads stuck out like sore sartorial thumbs.\"\n"}

{"id": "1649270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1649270", "title": "Carlos Marighella", "text": "Carlos Marighella\n\nCarlos Marighella (; 5 December 1911 – 4 November 1969) was a Marxist Brazilian writer, politician and guerilla fighter who lived during the 20th century.\n\nMarighella's most famous contribution to revolutionary literature was the \"Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla\", consisting of advice on how to disrupt and overthrow an authoritarian regime, aiming at revolution. Written shortly before his death late 1969 in São Paulo, \"Minimanual\" was first published in North America by the \"Berkeley Tribe\" in Berkeley, California in July 1970 in an English edition. Marighella also wrote \"For the Liberation of Brazil\". The theories laid out in both books have greatly influenced contemporary ideological activism. His ideas of revolution were complementary to Che Guevara's, who proposed guerrilla activity in the countryside, Marighela's theories on urban guerrilla warfare envisaged cities as a key point of support for the peasant's armed revolt. As an advocate of urban guerrilla warfare as means to assist a larger scale rural uprising, Marighella's work was the latest tome in the small library of revolutionary political literature in the 20th century. The \"Minimanual\" was highly admired among student revolutionaries in America, Europe and Ireland including the Weathermen, Irish Republican Army, Greek N17, Basque ETA separatists, the Red Army Faction, Red Brigades and Direct Action-France.\n\nMarighella was born in Salvador, Bahia, to Italian immigrant Augusto Marighella and Afro-Brazilian Maria Rita do Nascimento. His father was a blue-collar worker originally from Emilia, while his mother was a descendant of African slaves, brought from Sudan (Hausa blacks). He spent his young life at a house in Rua do Desterro, at the Baixa do Sapateiro neighbourhood, where he would graduate from primary and secondary education. In 1934, he left the Polytechnic School of Bahia, where he was pursuing a degree in civil engineering, in order to become an active member of the Brazilian Communist Party (Partido Comunista Brasileiro - PCB). He then moved to Rio de Janeiro to work in the restructuring of PCB.\n\nMarighella was first arrested in 1932, after he wrote a poem criticizing the administration of Bahia intervener Juracy Magalhães. On 1 May 1936, during the Getúlio Vargas time in presidency, he was once again arrested for subversion. He was tortured by the political police led by Filinto Müller, now considered the \"patron of torturers\" in Brazil. He remained in jail for a year. He was released by \"macedada\" (the measure which freed political prisoners without pressing charges against them). After his release, he once again entered clandestinity, along with all members of PCB. He was recaptured in 1939, once again being tortured. He was not released until 1945, when an amnesty during the democratization process of the country benefitted all political prisoners.\n\nThe following year, Marighella was elected constituent federal deputy by the Bahian branch of PCB, but he lost his office in 1948 under the new proscription of the party. Back in clandestinity, he occupied several offices in the leadership of the party. Invited by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Marighella visited China between 1953 and 1954 in order to learn more about the Chinese Communist Revolution. In May 1964, after the military coup, he was shot and arrested by agents of the Department of Social and Political Order (Departamento de Ordem Política e Social - DOPS), the political police, at a movie theater in Rio. He was released in the following year by a court order. In 1966, he wrote \"The Brazilian Crisis\", opting for the armed struggle against the military dictatorship. Later that year, he renounced his office in the national leadership of PCB.\nOn August 1967, he participated at the 1st Conference of Latin American Solidarity in Havana, contradicting what party had determined. In Havana, he wrote \"Some Questions About the Guerrillas in Brazil\", dedicated to the memory of Che Guevara and made public by \"Jornal do Brasil\" on 5 September 1968. That same year he was expelled from PCB, and founded the Ação Libertadora Nacional (ALN) on February 1968. In September 1969, ALN members kidnapped the U.S. ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick in a coordinated move with the Revolutionary Movement 8th October (Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro — MR-8).\n\nAfter a series of successful robberies and kidnappings, the police force was determined to eliminate him. He was shot by police at an ambush at 8pm on 4 November 1969 at 800 Alameda Casa Branca, São Paulo. This ambush was organized by police deputy Sérgio Paranhos Fleury, known for his work inside DOPS.\n\n"}

{"id": "1093930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1093930", "title": "David Brudnoy", "text": "David Brudnoy\n\nDavid Barry Brudnoy (June 5, 1940 – December 9, 2004) was an American talk radio host in Boston from 1976 to 2004. His radio talk show aired on WBZ radio. He was known for espousing his libertarian views on a wide range of political issues, in a manner that was courteous. Thanks to WBZ's wide signal reach, he gained a following from across the United States as well as Canada. On December 9, 2004, he succumbed to Merkel cell carcinoma after it had metastasized to his lungs and kidneys.\n\nBorn in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, to a Jewish family, David Brudnoy was the only child of Doris and Harry Brudnoy. Harry was a dentist in the Minneapolis area, a profession he maintained for over 50 years. During his youth, David Brudnoy was known to be precocious, and in addition to reading a lot, he enjoyed collecting stamps. He was also interested in history, and thanks to the influence of his Aunt Kathie, with whom he was close for all of his life, he became interested in movies; he often attended them with her. Years later, Brudnoy would become known for his work as a film critic, and he remarked in his autobiography that his aunt had undoubtedly contributed to his success by taking him to so many films.\n\nAlthough he did not articulate it at the time, he was also aware of certain homosexual attractions. Years later, he would detail the confusion he felt, discussing his teenage and college years in his 1997 autobiography, \"Life is Not a Rehearsal\". During his childhood, Brudnoy and his family briefly lived in Macon, Georgia, and San Antonio, Texas; his father had enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and the moves were so that he could be near army bases. Brudnoy first attended college in 1958, receiving a B.A. from Yale in New Haven. He also received M.A.s from Harvard and Brandeis, and a Ph.D. from Brandeis, focusing on East Asian studies and history. He received an honorary doctorate from Emerson College in 1996.\n\nAs a professor, Brudnoy taught classes or was a guest lecturer at many major colleges and universities throughout Boston and New England, as well as in Texas: Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern University, Merrimack College, University of Rhode Island, Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, as well as Texas Southern University. He was respected as an educator: student evaluations for his courses at Boston University indicate that they were very well received, and former students were among those who wrote eloquent tributes to him when he died. According to those students, he was such a devoted educator that even as he was dying, he made certain to finish grading their term papers.\n\nBrudnoy began a career in broadcast commentary in 1971 on Boston's local PBS television station, WGBH-TV. In 1976, he took over as host of his friend Avi Nelson's radio show on WHDH, in the midst of the city's unrest over forced busing and desegregation in schools. He took to the job with ease, and increasingly gained popularity. From 1981 to 1986, he appeared on former Top 40 station WRKO, which was now news and talk, before moving to local stalwart WBZ. The top-rated talk radio host in New England, he appeared in a regular weekday evening slot until his retirement. At the end of his career, Brudnoy was, according to WBZ Radio's promotional materials, derived from Arbitron ratings, among the most-listened-to evening talk hosts in the United States.\n\nOver the years, Brudnoy also appeared as a news commentator and host on local TV stations besides WGBH, including WCVB-TV (ABC), WNAC-TV, and WBZ-TV (CBS). He also appeared nationally on the \"CBS Morning News\". He wrote movie reviews for \"Boston\" magazine and local community newspapers. During the 1970s he wrote articles for the \"National Review\", and befriended its editor William F. Buckley Jr. He also wrote for \"The Alternative\" (later known as \"The American Prospect\") in the early 1970s, but quit because of the editor's unwillingness to adopt a more liberal position on gay rights. His articles have appeared in \"The New York Times\", \"The New Republic\", and \"The Saturday Evening Post\".\n\nIn 1990, his WBZ show was canceled in favor of a less expensive syndicated show hosted by Tom Snyder, but a mass public response, including support from \"The Boston Globe\" and the \"Boston Herald\", helped lead to his quick return to the station's lineup.\n\nBrudnoy's popularity escalated him into the Boston media elite, and he was the host of numerous social gatherings at his upscale Back Bay apartment, mixing students, media personalities, and politicians. After his bout with AIDS, Brudnoy began broadcasting from his apartment four nights out of five, welcoming his radio guests into his home and eagerly offering them cocktails. When he returned to the air in early January 1995, after his first battle with HIV/AIDS kept him off the air for ten weeks, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino formally declared January 5 as \"David Brudnoy Day\" due to his popularity.\n\nIn 1997, Brudnoy was awarded the Freedom of Speech Award from the National Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts, and was nominated for the major market \"Personality of the Year\" Marconi Radio Award by the National Association of Broadcasters. In 2001, he celebrated his 25th anniversary on the air. He was inducted to the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame, posthumously, in 2008.\n\nBrudnoy's strongly libertarian opinions were expressed with wit and thoughtfulness. He described his own manner as \"less ideological and more empathic\", in contrast to more recent figures of conservative talk radio. Many regard him as a unique radio host who was effective at injecting a different perspective into the political dialogue rather than merely cultivating a particular political segment of the population.\n\nHis non-partisan, thoughtful way of discussing issues helped him gain a large following despite being based in a staunchly Democratic region. Political figures from both ends of the spectrum have praised him for his contributions to the local and national dialogue. Among those who eulogized him when he died were liberals like Senator Edward M. Kennedy who said that David was uniquely fair to his guests. \"He couldn't care less about your party label, as long as you knew what you were talking about, because he always did\"; and conservatives like then-Governor Mitt Romney who said that Brudnoy was \"... a friend to hundreds of thousands of people, most of whom he never even saw in person . . . David has left us all a huge inheritance. It's an inheritance rich in tolerance, in faith, in the greatness of humanity, in respect for all people...\"\n\nIn 2000, Brudnoy declared himself a member of the Libertarian Party.\n\nAlthough his father Harry was a practicing Jew and a member of a Minneapolis synagogue, David Brudnoy was an agnostic who disliked organized religion and was critical of religions that tried to impose their views on others. He did have a bar mitzvah in May 1953, but he was already becoming skeptical of religion and recalled that event as the last time he followed his religious traditions. Years later, he wrote several opinion pieces about his opposition to religious dogmatism. But on the other hand, he also wrote favorably about the good that the church was capable of doing. In one piece, he stated that \"...the church itself, for Catholics and non-Catholics alike, is a bulwark of our society. Its severely overburdened clergy are crucial to the development of our youths, to comforting our elders, and to tending our sick.\"\n\nBut while he was a skeptic about the tenets of organized religion, during his late-2004 bout of serious illness he admitted he had prayed in various ways, including with a Catholic priest who was a friend of his; and he said that he had discussed religion with several of his Jewish friends, including political commentator Jon Keller and conservative newspaper columnist Jeff Jacoby. But he said he did not expect to go to either a heaven or a hell.\n\nBrudnoy came to realize that he was homosexual early in life but successfully hid the fact for many years. While at Texas Southern, he \"adopted\" a young, recently single mother, Patricia Kennedy, and for many years Brudnoy and Kennedy enjoyed a relationship of mutual convenience, with Brudnoy able to use Kennedy as a cover for his homosexuality, and in return serving as a surrogate father to her two young children. Brudnoy did not come out to his father and stepmother until his illness in 1994; his father Harry was 88 years old when Brudnoy finally phoned him to give him the news and also discuss the health crisis he was undergoing. David was pleasantly surprised that his parents were supportive. Brudnoy had previously come out to his aunt and uncle after they lost a son (also homosexual) to AIDS.\n\nBrudnoy came out publicly in 1994, after returning from hospitalization to overcome his long-hidden fight with AIDS. Having attracted a largely conservative audience based on his political views, traditional anti-homosexual conservatives rejected him , though others admired him for his courage. Despite the controversy, his ratings reportedly did not suffer as a result. The controversy was rekindled somewhat after the release of his autobiography, in which he described a history of sexual excesses. Brudnoy did not attempt to mask his sexuality during his adult life, but also made no direct indications of it; it was well-known among his colleagues in broadcasting long before he spoke publicly about it. His closest and oldest friend was psychologist Dr. Ward Cromer, with whom he took dozens of trips abroad, and who was incorrectly assumed by many to be Brudnoy's sexual partner. Neither of them used that phraseology to describe their relationship, preferring a more accurate title of \"best friend\". When Brudnoy died, it was Cromer who became executor of his estate.\n\nBrudnoy was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, but kept his treatment a secret until his condition became serious after he contracted pneumonia in 1994. He was absent from public life for some time to fight the disease. Comatose and near death at one point, he eventually returned to reasonable health. It was at that time, in order to conserve his strength, that he broadcast his show from his apartment in the Back Bay section of Boston during part of 1994. Once he was able to return to the air, Brudnoy announced the creation of a fund to fight AIDS. His illness inspired him to publish his autobiography; at the time, it was not a best-seller, but after he died, it became a collector's item, since his publisher had originally let it go out of print and now many of his fans wanted copies of it.\n\nIn September 2003, he was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare form of skin cancer. After hospitalization and treatment, including another period of being considered near death, the cancer went into apparent remission, and Brudnoy returned to work, with a strained voice, in March 2004. However, in November 2004, doctors discovered that cancer had spread into his lungs and kidneys, forcing him to undergo dialysis in addition to cancer treatment.\n\nBrudnoy checked into Massachusetts General Hospital on December 3, 2004. On December 8, Brudnoy made his last radio broadcast on his show via a deathbed interview with WBZ reporter Gary LaPierre. The following day, Brudnoy ordered his doctors to remove all artificial life support systems, leaving him only with oxygen, morphine, and minimal food.

He was an Irish language activist and member of Conradh na Gaeilge. In 1907, he was arrested and had his groceries seized when he refused to pay a fine for having his grocery wagon painted with \"Domhnall Ua Buachalla\" (his name in the Irish language), as British law required grocery wagons to be registered only in the English language.\n\nHe was a member of the Irish Volunteers and on the outbreak of the 1916 Easter Rising he walked the 26 kilometres to Dublin to fight in the Rising.. He was imprisoned in the mass arrests and deportations that followed, and released in 1917. Like many Rising survivors, he joined Sinn Féin, a small separatist party that was wrongly blamed by the British government for the Easter Rising. In the aftermath of the Rising, survivors led by Éamon de Valera took over the party in the struggle for the establishment of an Irish republic. Ua Buachalla was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for Kildare North at the 1918 general election. He served in the First Dáil (1918–1921), and was re-elected to the Second Dáil in 1921 as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Kildare–Wicklow. He sided with de Valera and opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He fought in the Four Courts in the Civil War. Imprisoned in Dundalk jail, he was released by the Anti-Treaty troops in August 1922. He lost his seat at the 1922 general election, and was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1923 general election.\n\nHe joined Fianna Fáil on its foundation in 1926 and was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Kildare constituency at the June 1927 general election, only to lose that seat in the 1932 general election, which Fianna Fáil won. He was chosen by Éamon de Valera to become Governor-General of the Irish Free State following James McNeill's resignation in November 1932.\n\nDe Valera explicitly instructed Ua Buachalla as Governor-General to keep a low public profile, and not to fulfil public engagements, which was part of de Valera's policy to make the office an irrelevance by reducing it to invisibility. While he continued to give the Royal Assent to legislation, summon and dissolve Dáil Éireann and fulfil the other formal duties of the office, he declined all public invitations and kept himself invisible, as advised by his Government. In fact in his period in office he performed only one public function: the receipt of the credentials of the French Ambassador in the Council Chamber, Government Buildings, 1933, on behalf of King George V. However, de Valera subsequently had that duty moved from the Governor-General to his own post of President of the Executive Council;\ninstead of presenting his credentials to Ua Buachalla, the US Legation Minister, William Wallace McDowell, presented himself to de Valera.\nOne of the few other occasions Ua Buachalla was mentioned at all in public was when, in the aftermath of the death of King George V in January 1936, he had to reply to messages of condolence sent to the Irish people by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull. \n\nOn de Valera's instruction, Ua Buachalla did not reside in the official residence of the Governor-General, the Viceregal Lodge (now called Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence of the President of Ireland). Instead, a house was rented for his use in Monkstown, outside of Dublin. The official English title \"Governor-General\" was largely replaced by the official Irish title \"Seanascal\" or its direct translation, \"Seneschal\"; however, \"Governor-General\" remained the legal form used in official English-language documents and proclamations. Ua Buachalla refused all but £2,000 of the £10,000 salary of the Governor-General.\n\nUa Buachalla fell out with de Valera over the manner of his exit from office, in December 1936. De Valera sought to use the abdication crisis surrounding King Edward VIII to amend the Irish Free State's Constitution to abolish both the Crown and the office of governor-general. Having done so, he faced a threat of a court case from Ua Buachalla, who had been left personally liable for the remaining one year's expensive private lease on his residence, following the sudden abolition of his office. In practice, between 1933 and December 1936, the Irish government had paid Ua Buachalla expenses, from which he paid the rent on the expensive residence which was picked for him.\n\nHowever, from December 1936, the government insisted that it had no responsibility for paying for the residence. Ua Buachalla had, in 1932, on de Valera's explicit advice, leased the residence for a full five years, which was his expected term of office. There remained one year's outstanding lease, for a residence he could not now afford and for which he had no need now as he was no longer governor-general. Eventually, de Valera was forced to grant Ua Buachalla a large pension and to pay his outstanding rent and expenses to stop a potentially embarrassing court case going ahead. Ua Buachalla attended the inauguration of the first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, in Dublin Castle in June 1938.\n\nUa Buachalla and de Valera reunited as political partners, and in a symbolic act of apology, de Valera, when elected President of Ireland in 1959 appointed Ua Buachalla to his advisory Council of State. However, he returned to Maynooth to continue running his family business, the hardware store which had been founded in 1853.\n\nDomhnall Ua Buachalla died, aged 97, in a nursing home in Dublin. He was given a state funeral and buried in Laraghbryan Cemetery in Maynooth, with the graveside oration delivered by President de Valera.\n\nThe Ua Buachalla hardware store closed in October 2005. The road beside this store is named after him (although translated to English as \"Buckley's Lane\"). The building has been demolished, but some of the frontage has been preserved, with the building bearing the name \"Buckley House\".\n"}

He began making and recording prank calls in the mid-1960s to provide comic relief for a bedridden friend. Since 1989, he has released over 40 albums of collected calls, having sold over 250 thousand copies, arguably becoming the most famous prank call artist ever in the Spanish speaking world. He made extensive use of Argentine \"Lunfardo\" vernacular, and his tapes have been praised by critics as varied as humorist Carlos Loiseau and philosopher Alejandro Rozitchner.\n\nThe general format of his jokes is to make a polite call requesting information about some product or service, to then randomly insult or otherwise antagonize the person on the other end in order to produce a verbal altercation or exchange of insults. Part of the humor is to use crude language in absurd contexts, exploiting the reactions of his victims and provoking their often agitated response.\n\nIn other cases, he begins the call with a fictitious complaint (although often based on real life anecdotes), regarding things that have supposedly happened to \"his nephew.\" For example: \"My nephew went to get two \"matafuegos\" (Spanish for fire extinguisher; literally: fire-killer) for the car, but they didn't kill the fire, they just injured it.\"\n\nSince 1998, Tangalanga made various calls to a gym management named Octavio, the first was in \"Dr. Tangalanga es mundial\", then Octavio apparenced in severals compilations. The Octavio calls are 12 in total, with the last performed live in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

These five were the progenitors of the Midianites.\n\nThe name of three persons in the Old Testament, two men and one woman.\n\n\"(1) The son of Midian, descended from Abraham by his wife Keturah (Genesis 25:4 ; 1 Chronicles 1:33), mentioned again in Isaiah 60:6 as a transporter of gold and frankincense from Sheba, who shall thus bring enlargement to Judah and praise to Yahweh.

The Targum Pseudo-Jonathan implies that an omer was the equivalent of the capacity of 43.2 eggs. In dry weight, various rabbinical sources rule that the \"omer\" weighed between 1.560 kg. to 1.770 kg., being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the dough offering. It corresponds to the bath (Ezekiel 45:11) in liquid measure and was the standard for measuring grain and similar articles since it is classed with balances and weights (Leviticus 19:36 ; Amos 8:5) in the injunctions regarding just dealing in trade.

{"id": "51272106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51272106", "title": "Evan McMullin", "text": "Evan McMullin\n\nDavid Evan McMullin (born April 2, 1976) is a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operations officer who ran as an independent during the 2016 United States presidential election. \n\nMcMullin was an operations officer of the CIA from 2001–2010. He then worked for about a year and a half as an investment banker after receiving an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 2011. He was a senior adviser on national security issues for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2013–2015, and served as a chief policy director for the House Republican Conference in the U.S. House of Representatives from January 2015 through July 2016. \n\nIn August 2016, McMullin launched a presidential campaign in the 2016 election for President of the United States, as an independent candidate backed by the organization Better for America. Receiving support from some members of the \"Never Trump\" movement, polling taken late in the campaign showed him ahead of major party nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in his home state of Utah. In the end, McMullin received 21% in Utah, taking third place behind both Trump and Clinton, receiving 0.53% of the national popular vote.\n\nFollowing his defeat, McMullin has emerged as a vocal critic of the Trump Administration.\n\nMcMullin was born in Provo, Utah, the oldest of four children of David McMullin and Lanie Bullard. At a young age, his family moved to a rural area outside Seattle, Washington, where his father worked as a computer scientist and his mother sold bulk foods to neighbors from the family's garage. After graduating in 1994 from Auburn Senior High School, McMullin spent two years in Brazil as an LDS missionary. Upon returning, he spent a summer working on an Alaskan fishing vessel.\n\nIn 1997, McMullin began attending Brigham Young University; every year he was in college he did a summer internship with the CIA. He spent a year living in Israel and Jordan and volunteered as a refugee resettlement officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2001, McMullin graduated with a Bachelor's degree in International Law and Diplomacy and began formal training with the CIA to become an operations officer.\n\nAfter working for the CIA, McMullin attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania where he received a Master of Business Administration degree in 2011.\n\nSoon after McMullin joined the CIA, the September 11 attacks occurred, leading to an accelerated training and deployment. He spent the next decade working overseas on counterterrorism and intelligence operations as an operations officer with the National Clandestine Service in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. He was first deployed in 2003 and left the agency in 2010.\n\nWhile the details of his missions remain classified, former CIA officers who worked with McMullin were complimentary of his work, noting his talent for recruiting members of extremist organizations through building trust and willingness to engage in human intelligence outside the confines of the embassy. Some of his missions included information-gathering for efforts against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and collaborating with British intelligence agencies. Near the end of his CIA career, he worked undercover in Iraq. He has stated that his work involved meeting with business and government leaders, as well as collecting information from terrorist operatives.\n\nAfter leaving the CIA and graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 2011, McMullin began working for the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs, and he remained at the company about a year and a half. In 2012, he volunteered for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, which indirectly led to him being recruited by Republicans on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs looking for an adviser with counter-terrorism experience. In 2013, McMullin was an International Advisory Board member for the Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young University.\n\nIn 2013, McMullin became a senior adviser on national security issues for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for the 113th Congress. In 2015, McMullin became the chief policy director of the House Republican Conference under Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.). It was from this position that he watched the 2016 Republican primaries, and when he began to speak out against Trump he was urged by some Republicans to stay out of the fray. McMullin resigned as chief policy director shortly before declaring his run for the presidency in August 2016.\n\nIn August 2016, McMullin launched a presidential campaign in the 2016 election for President of the United States, as an independent candidate backed by the organization Better for America. McMullin described himself as a conservative alternative to the two major political parties' candidates, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nMcMullin lost the election, receiving 725,902 votes nationwide (0.53%). His best performance came in his native Utah, where he received about 20% of the vote and came in third place behind Trump and Clinton. After the election, McMullin said that he would start a \"new conservative movement\" reaching out to \"non-traditional conservative voters... who feel disaffected.\" It might, he said, form a new political party. On January 25, 2017, McMullin announced the formation of Stand Up Republic, a nonpartisan watchdog organization meant to ensure that the Trump administration upholds democracy and tells the truth.\n\nOn August 8, 2016, McMullin announced that he would run as a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election as an independent. McMullin decided to run due to his belief that Republican nominee Donald Trump was unfit for the office and his strong opposition to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's liberalism. He had personally lobbied several Congresspeople to run under the Better for America banner, but when none would run and it was suggested to him that he should run himself, he decided to do so.\n\nMcMullin had the support of several anti-Trump Republican donors and his presidential bid was also backed by several former members of Better for America, a 501(c)(4) organization dedicated to getting nationwide ballot access for an independent candidate for President in the 2016 election. McMullin's campaign is supported by some members of the \"Never Trump\" movement. Trump repeatedly attacked McMullin, referring to him as \"McMuffin\" and stating that \"I never even heard of this guy before. Nobody did.\"\n\nMcMullin's late entrance into the race caused him to miss several state ballot deadlines, and ultimately he was only able to appear on the ballot in eleven states, with write-in eligibility in many other states. As such he did not appear on enough ballots to win the necessary Electoral College majority of 270 electoral votes. Instead McMullin hoped to deny a majority of the electoral vote to either of the two major party candidates. In such a scenario, under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment, the House of Representatives would select the new president from the top-three electoral vote winners.\n\nThe same day that McMullin launched his independent bid, it was announced that Kahlil Byrd and Chris Ashby, Republican strategists with expertise in third-party ballot access, would form a super PAC called Stand Up America to support McMullin's campaign. Byrd is a former adviser to Better for America. The PAC would be used for TV and digital ads, live events, and grass-roots organizing, but would not sue for ballot access.\n\nOn October 6, McMullin named Mindy Finn as his running mate. Finn had previously worked for Twitter and as a digital strategist for the RNC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Because Finn's selection came after the ballot paperwork deadlines, Finn did not appear on any of the state ballots. Instead McMullin's friend's name, Nathan Johnson, was submitted as a placeholder.\n\nMcMullin's support surged in Utah in October after the release of a 2005 audio recording in which Donald Trump was heard bragging in lewd terms about making sexual advances on women. On October 19, an Emerson College poll showed McMullin leading the race in Utah by 4 points over Donald Trump and 7 points over Hillary Clinton. McMullin's popularity in Utah – and Trump's unpopularity – appears owing to an unusual shift of Mormons away from the Republican candidate. Had McMullin won Utah, it would have been the first time since 1968 that a non-major-party candidate won a state. His strong polling in Utah led Benjamin Morris, writing for FiveThirtyEight, to call him the \"third-most likely person to be the next president of the United States\" as of October 13.\n\nUltimately, McMullin came in third place in Utah, receiving 21.54% of the state's popular vote, behind both Donald Trump (who received 45.54% and the state's six electoral votes) and Hillary Clinton (who received 27.46%). McMullin also took third in Idaho with 6.7%. McMullin promised that, despite his defeat, the \"fight would continue\" for his new conservative movement.\n\nAfter the 2016 campaign, McMullin has continued to be strongly critical of Trump and Putin. In a December 2016, op-ed, McMullin blasted Trump as a threat to American constitutional government, saying that the president-elect's actions were \"consistent with the authoritarian playbook\" and \"undermined critical democratic norms including peaceful debate and transitions of power, commitment to truth, freedom from foreign interference and abstention from the use of executive power for political retribution.\"\n\nIn late January 2017, McMullin and his former running mate Finn announced the establishment of a 501(c)(4) organization, Stand Up Republic. The group focuses on \"defense of democratic (small 'd') norms, constitutionalism and civic involvement.\" Speaking on so-called \"alternative facts\" McMullin said: \"Undermining truth is a typical authoritarian tactic. It is incredibly dangerous ... We never thought we'd be talking about this in America.\" In a February 2017 op-ed, McMullin wrote that \"President Trump's disturbing Russian connections present an acute danger to American national security.\" He called upon congressional Republicans to \"recommit to patriotic prudence\" and \"demand that Attorney General Jeff Sessions appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Russia's assault on American democracy and Mr. Trump's possible collusion with the Kremlin.\n\nWhen asked if there was any possibility of him running for Jason Chaffetz's seat in 2018, he answered: \"It is likely that I will seek public office again. That might be in 2018 or it might be sometime down the road, perhaps very far down the road. I genuinely just don't know yet. I'm very focused on things that I think need to be done ASAP and Mindy Finn and I, with our team at Stand Up Republic, advancing them now. It is possible that I will challenge Chaffetz or Senator Hatch, but there are a lot of factors that go into that decision.\"\n\nMcMullin opposes abortion and identifies himself as pro-life. McMullin supports overturning \"Roe v. Wade\". According to his campaign website, he opposes \"a culture that subsidizes abortion on demand\" and McMullin calls for action to reduce unintended pregnancies and promote adoption.\n\nOn same-sex marriage, McMullin said in 2016 that he believes in the \"traditional marriage between a man and a woman\" but he \"respects\" the Supreme Court's decision in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" (which found that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry) and thinks it is \"time to move on\" from the issue. McMullin's mother is in a same-sex marriage, having married another woman after separating from his father, and McMullin has said that \"As far as my mother's marriage is concerned, I believe in the sanctity of traditional marriage. It is an important part of my faith. My mother has a different view. That is OK. I love her very much.\"\n\nMcMullin supports free trade, pointing to the economic benefits of international trade. He supports NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nMcMullin supports the Republican House plan on tax reform. McMullin supports a reduction in the corporate income tax and individual income tax, as well as the estate tax.\n\nMcMullin favors cuts to entitlement programs such as Social Security, and has proposed means-testing the program and raising the retirement age.\n\nMcMullin accepts the scientific consensus on climate change, saying: \"I do believe that the climate is changing, and I do believe that human activity is contributing to it. If I were president, I would increase investment in technologies that can help us limit and decrease our carbon emissions.\"\n\nMcMullin has said that if elected president, he would appoint originalist judges to the Supreme Court, \"in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.\"\n\nOn immigration, McMullin supports border security but not mass deportation.\n\nOn health care, McMullin supports the provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that blocks health insurance companies from denying coverage or discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. However, he also stated that \"we also need to do better than ObamaCare.\"\n\nOn the Syrian Civil War, McMullin described himself as a \"vocal advocate for international action that would stop Assad's slaughter of innocent Syrians, and eventually set the stage for a negotiated departure from the country.\" McMullin also has said: \"We should have done more to support the moderate Syrian opposition, and we still need to do that. They haven't received sufficient support or training, and we know how to do that very well.\" McMullin supports imposing a no-fly zone over Syria \"to stop the aerial bombardment of Syrian population centers.\"\n\nMcMullin supports keeping the Guantanamo Bay detention camp open.\n\nMcMullin has harshly criticized the international nuclear agreement with Iran. He stated: \"We've got to certainly enforce the deal as it is, but I believe in strengthening sanctions on Iran to force them to make further concessions. I also believe in putting the military option clearly back on the table if Iran decides to not keep its end of the deal and if it ultimately decides to pursue nuclear weapons.\"\n\nMcMullin told ABC News that he believed Donald Trump's public comments were frustrating U.S. counterterrorism efforts. \"What he doesn't realize is that we actually depend on Muslims to do counterterrorism, to wage war against terrorists.\" Trump's remarks concerning Muslims \"decreases their willingness to work with us, with other Muslims, and that impedes our ability to destroy ISIS.\" McMullin also criticized Trump's \"allegiance to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin\" and accused Putin of engaging in a campaign to destabilize European and North American countries \"through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups and different religious groups.\"\n\nIn 2014, McMullin helped to bring Caesar, a defected Syrian military photographer who leaked 55,000 images depicting abuses by the regime (which formed the basis for the 2014 Syrian detainee report), to speak before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, according to \"The Christian Science Monitor\". McMullin clashed with State Department officials he suspected were holding up the hearing. McMullin claimed that State Department officials wanted to have a closed hearing.\n\nMcMullin opposes the use of torture and has criticized Trump's support for it.\n\nHe is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \n\nMcMullin has never been married.\n\n\n"}

He served as both Minister of the Navy and Minister of Foreign Affairs and was a recipient of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. In his naval career, he was best known for his actions during the Italian Wars of Independence and later as commander of the International Squadron off Crete in 1897–1898.\n\nThe descendant of a Ligurian family originally from Zoagli, Canevaro was born in Lima, Peru, to Giuseppe and Francesca Velaga.\n\nIn 1852, Canevaro was admitted to the Kingdom of Sardinia's Royal Navy School at Genoa, completing the course of instruction in 1855 and receiving a commission as an ensign second class.\n\nIn 1859, with the rank of second lieutenant, Canevaro took part in Royal Sardinian Navy operations in the Adriatic Sea aboard the transport \"Beroldo\" and the sailing frigate during the Second Italian War of Independence.\n\nIn 1860, Canevaro arrived in Palermo, Sicily, aboard , the flagship of the Sardinian squadron. When the supporters of the Italian nationalist leader General Giuseppe Garibaldi organized their navy, he resigned from the Royal Sardinian Navy to enlist in the Garibaldian navy. Aboard the steam frigate \"Tukory\" on the night of 13 August 1860, Canevaro distinguished himself during an unsuccessful attempt to board the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies steam ship-of-the-line \"Monarca\" while she was anchored in the port of Castellammare di Stabia. He received the Silver Medal of Military Valor for his actions during this engagement.\n\nIn the autumn of 1860, Canevarro was reinstated in the Royal Sardinian Navy. While embarked on the Sardinian steam frigate from December 1860 to March 1861, he took part in the Siege of Gaeta and a siege of Messina during operations in which \"Carlo Alberto\" repeatedly exchanged fire with hostile forces at close range along the coast. After the campaign, he was made a Knight of the Military Order of Savoy, and in 1863, he was promoted to \"luogotenente de vascello\". In 1865–1866, Canevaro was on board the steam frigate , under the command Guglielmo Acton, during a long cruise that included a transatlantic voyage, operations along the Atlantic coast of South America, a transit of the Strait of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean, and steaming up the coast of Chile.\n\nOn returning to Italy, he was assigned to the broadside ironclad , commanded by Augusto Riboty. Aboard \"Re di Portogallo\", he took part in 1866 in the Third Italian War of Independence, during which the ship was engaged in operations against the fortress of Lissa in the Adriatic Sea. As flagship of the 3rd Division, and with Canevaro aboard as the division's chief-of-staff, \"Re di Portogallo\" led the division's attack on Porto San Giorgio on 18 July 1866.\n\nOn 20 July 1866, \"Re di Portogallo\" played a particularly prominent role in the Battle of Lissa against the Austrian fleet. She first opened fire on the Austrian steam corvette , scoring a hit below the waterline that opened a leak that caused more water to enter \"Erzherzog Friedrich\" than her pumps could handle, forcing \" Erzherzog Friedrich\" to retreat in the direction of Lissa. While chasing the damaged \"Erzherzog Friedrich\", \"Re di Portogallo\" sighted the Austrian steam ship-of-the-line , which, although seriously damaged by a broadside fired by the Italian ironclad ram , was approaching to defend \"Erzherzog Friedrich\". \"Re di Portogallo\" attempted to ram \"Kaiser\", but \"Kaiser\" steered toward \"Re di Portogallo\" and the two ships collided violently head-on. \"Kaiser\" had the worst of the collision, which badly damaged her bow, destroyed her bowsprit, and left her figurehead, a wooden statue of the Austrian emperor Kaiser Franz Joseph I, stuck in the hull of \"Re di Portogallo\"; it became an Italian war trophy. Entangled with \"Kaiser\", \"Re di Portogallo\" pummeled her with gunfire at close range, inflicting many casualties on her crew and bringing down her foresail, which crashed onto her funnel. \"Re di Portogallo\" put her engines astern to pull away from \"Kaiser\" and maneuver to ram her again, but could not resume her attack because smoke had concealed \"Kaiser\", which the officers of \"Re di Portogallo\" mistakenly believed may have sunk. As the battle continued \"Re di Portogallo\" found herself surrounded by four Austrian ships, but she managed to escape from them thanks to the ability of her commander, Riboty. One of the Italian ships most heavily involved in the battle, \"Re di Portogallo\" suffered serious damage, including the loss of her anchors and some of her boats and having of her armor dislodged, most of this damage occurring during the duel with \"Kaiser\". Although the outcome of the Battle of Lissa ultimately was disastrous for the Italian fleet, Canevaro received a second award of the Silver Medal for Military Valor, while \"Re di Portogallo\"s comanding officer Riboty received the Gold Medal of Military Valor.\n\nPromoted to \"capitano di fregata\" in 1869, Canevaro served as a naval attaché at the Italian embassy in London from March 1874 to August 1876. From January 1877 to March 1879, while in command of the cruiser , he circumnavigated the globe, departing Italy, transiting the Suez Canal, skirting Asia, visiting ports in China and the Netherlands East Indies – where \"Colombo\" recovered the body of the Italian general and politician Nino Bixio, who had died of cholera in Banda Aceh on Sumatra in 1873 – and then went on to Japan, Russia (including Siberia), Australia and the Americas. After transiting the Strait of Magellan into the Atlantic Ocean, \"Colombo\" steamed up the coast of South America to the Caribbean, then crossed the Atlantic to return to Italy.\n\nPromoted to \"capitano di vascello\", Canevaro performed various important duties, including service as chief-of-staff of the 3rd Maritime Department headquartered at Venice, second-in-command of the Italian Naval Academy, and commanding officer of the ironclad battleship . In 1884, while in command of \"Italia\", he played an active role in humanitarian work and public health during a cholera epidemic in La Spezia, and he received the Silver Medal for Civil Valor for these efforts.\n\nPromoted to counter admiral (the equivalent of rear admiral) in 1887, Canevaro assumed command of the arsenal of Taranto and later of the 2nd Naval Division of the Permanent Squadron. He was promoted to vice admiral in 1893, and King Umberto I appointed him a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy – an appointment for life – in 1896, the same year in which he assumed command of the \"Regia Marina\"s Naval Squadron.\n\nIn February 1897, when a Christian uprising against the authority of the Ottoman Empire broke out on the island of Crete, Canevaro arrived at Crete in command of the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron, consisting of the ironclad battleships (his flagship) and , the protected cruiser , and the torpedo cruiser . Canevaro – who relieved the commander of the Italian naval squadron, Rear Admiral Gualterio, who had previously been in command of the 2nd Naval Division – assumed command of the International Squadron of warships off Crete on 16 or 17 February 1897 (sources differ) as the most senior admiral present, and took up duties as president of the \"Admirals Council,\" which consisted of the senior admirals present off Crete of each of the six countries participating in the International Squadron. The squadron put landing detachments ashore, but Christian insurgents continued to attack Ottoman forces and Canevaro soon ordered International Squadron ships to bombard them during February and March 1897 to stop the fighting. Although some political opponents in the Italian legislature attacked him for ordering the International Squadron to bombard the insurgents, Canevaro received great credit during his time in command of the squadron for his ability to exercise diplomacy and mediate disputes between the six Great Powers – Austria-Hungary, France, the German Empire, Italy, the Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom – making up the squadron and for the way in which he dealt with the confusing and anarchic situation on Crete, balancing humanitarian compassion and a spirit of conciliation in his dealings with Greek, Christian insurgent, and Ottoman forces on the island with the occasional need to use force to halt fighting and quell disturbances. Before leaving the International Squadron in 1898, Canevaro negotiated an agreement under which all combat on Crete would cease and Greece and the Ottoman Empire would withdraw their forces from the island in anticipation of the creation of an autonomous Cretan State under the suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan. Such was his reputation that when the creation of an office of High Commissioner of the Cretan State was proposed in the spring of 1898, Canevaro received an invitation to become the first high commissioner, but he declined the offer, and instead Prince George of Greece and Denmark became the first high commissioner when the Cretan State finally came into existence in December 1898.\n\nWhen Prime Minister of Italy Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudinì, formed the government for his fifth ministry, Canevaro turned over command of the International Squadron to its next-most-senior admiral, Rear Admiral Édouard Pottier of the French Navy, and returned to Italy to serve as di Rudini′s Minister of the Navy. Taking office on 1 June 1898, he served only four weeks, until the di Rudini government was replaced on 29 June 1898 by that of Prime Minister General Luigi Pelloux. On the same day Pelloux took office, Canevaro changed portfolios to become the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. In his new role, he attempted to continue Italy′s policy of loyalty to the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and the German Empire and of continued warm relations with the United Kingdom, but at the same time worked toward relaxing tensions with France, and he conducted secret negotiations with the French for a commercial treaty, which the countries signed on 26 November 1898. He also resisted pressure from Germany to change the status of the Cretan State, supporting its continuation as an autonomous state under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHowever, despite his successes in negotiations on Crete while in command of the International Squadron, Canevaro's talent for leading military forces did not translate into success in international diplomacy when it came to larger issues. During the Fashoda Crisis of 1899 between France and the United Kingdom, Canevaro conducted intensive diplomacy as part of the ongoing European \"Scramble for Africa\" in an effort to gain French and British recognition of an Italian interest in Libya, but when the French and British concluded an agreement on 21 March 1899 that resolved the crisis, they offered no such recognition. Canevaro also was unsuccessful when in the wake of a number of anarchist attacks in Europe – one of which resulted in the stabbing death of Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary Elizabeth on 10 September 1898 – he proposed an international anti-anarchist conference of diplomats and government security and judicial officials to address the situation; although some countries agreed to participate, the conference never took place.\n\nA final blow to Canevaro's diplomatic career came in the \"San Mun Affair\" of 1899, in which Italy demanded that the Chinese Empire grant it a lease for a naval coaling station at China's Sanmen Bay (known as \"San-Mun Bay\" to the Italians) similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at Kiaochow Bay. From Sanmen Bay, Italy hoped to establish an area of influence in Chekiang. The Russian Empire and the United States opposed the Italian demand, but the Italian ambassador in China, Renato De Martino, led Canevaro to believe that the area was ripe for the taking. The British government, although ambivalent toward the Italian move, gave its approval as long as Italy did not use force against the Chinese, but the British did not inform Canevaro that the United Kingdom′s representatives in China had advised that Italy could not achieve its goals without using force. Believing the opportunity to pursue Italy's interests in China was at hand, Canevaro had de Martino pass Italy′s demands to the Chinese imperial government in the winter of 1899, but the Chinese summarily rejected them on 4 March 1899. On 8 March, Canevaro instructed De Martino to present the demands again as an ultimatum and authorized the armored cruiser \"Marco Polo\" and protected cruiser \"Elba\" to occupy the bay. When the British ambassador in Rome reminded him that the United Kingdom did not support an Italian use of force, Canevaro issued a counterorder cancelling his authorization to use the two cruisers in the bay, but De Martino received the counterorder before he received the original authorization to employ the ships. Unable to decipher the counterorder, De Martino presented the Italian ultimatum to China again on 10 March 1899, and China immediately refused to comply. Italy withdrew its ultimatum, becoming at the end of the 19th century the first and only Western power to fail to achieve its territorial goals in China. The fiasco was an embarrassment that gave Italy – still stung by its defeat at the hands of the Ethiopian Empire in the Battle of Adowa in 1896 – the appearance of a third-rate power. On 14 March 1899, Canevaro attempted to present the affair to the Italian Parliament in a positive light, saying that be believed that China had rejected the Italian ultimatum in order to maintain a positive and productive relationship with Italy uninterrupted by negotiations over the bay, but such was the domestic criticism of the Italian failure as a humiliation and international criticism of it as a needless and unjustified provocation that Pelloux announced the resignation of his entire cabinet on 14 May 1899. He excluded Canevaro from the new cabinet he established that day.\n\nCanevaro returned to the navy, commanding the 3rd Maritime District from 16 July 1900 to 16 January 1902 and presiding over the Supreme Council of the Navy from 16 January 1902 until 6 July 1903. He then retired and was placed on the reserve list, although in retirement he was promoted to vice admiral of the navy on 1 December 1923. He died at Venice on 30 December 1926.\n\n Knight of the Grand Cross decorated with the Great Cordon of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus\n\n Order of Isabella the Catholic (Kingdom of Spain)\n\nCanevaro (spelled \"Canavaro\") is mentioned in Nikos Kazantzakis's novel Zorba the Greek and the subsequent film and musical, as the admiral and former lover of key character Madame Hortense, who thereafter calls Zorbas with his name.\n\nOne of the main streets of Chania city centre, \"odos Kanevarou\", is named after him.\n"}
{"id": "890754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=890754", "title": "Genevieve", "text": "Genevieve\n\nSaint Genevieve (; ; from Gaullish \"geno\" \"race, lineage\" and \"uida\" \"sage\") (Nanterre, 419/422 AD – Paris 502/512 AD), is the patron saint of Paris in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. Her feast day is kept on January the 3rd.\n\nShe was born in Nanterre and moved to Paris after encountering Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes and dedicated herself to a Christian life. In 451 she led a \"prayer marathon\" that was said to have saved Paris by diverting Attila's Huns away from the city. When the Germanic king Childeric I besieged the city in 464, she acted as an intermediary between the city and its besiegers, collecting food and convincing Childeric to release his prisoners.\n\nHer following and her status as patron saint of Paris were promoted by Clotilde, who may have commissioned the writing of her \"vita\". This was most likely written in Tours, where Clotilde retired after her husband's death, as evidenced also by the importance of Martin of Tours as a saintly model.\n\nThough there is a \"vita\" that purports to be written by a contemporary, Genevieve's history cannot be separated from her hagiography. She was described as a peasant girl born in Nanterre to Severus (a Gallo-Roman) and Geroncia (Greek origins). On his way to Britain, Germanus of Auxerre stopped at Nanterre, and Genevieve confided to him that she wanted to live only for God. He encouraged her and at the age of fifteen, Genevieve became a nun. On the deaths of her parents, she went to live with her godmother Lutetia in Paris (\"Lutetia\" was the former name of the city of Paris, so this has symbolic weight.) There the young woman became admired for her piety and devotion to works of charity, and practiced corporal austerities which included abstaining from meat and breaking her fast only twice in the week. \"These mortifications she continued for over thirty years, till her ecclesiastical superiors thought it their duty to make her diminish her austerities.\" She encountered opposition and criticism for her activities, both before and after she was again visited by Germanus from those who were jealous or considered her an impostor or hypocrite. \n\nGeneviève had frequent visions of heavenly saints and angels. She reported her visions and prophecies, until her enemies conspired to drown her in a lake. Through the intervention of Germanus, their animosity was finally overcome. The Bishop of Paris appointed her to look after the welfare of the virgins dedicated to God, and by her instruction and example she led them to a high degree of sanctity.\n\nShortly before the attack of the Huns under Attila in 451 on Paris, Genevieve and Germanus' archdeacon persuaded the panic-stricken people of Paris not to flee but to pray. It is claimed that the intercession of Genevieve's prayers caused Attila's army to go to Orléans instead. During Childeric's siege and blockade of Paris in 464, Geneviève passed through the siege lines in a boat to Troyes, bringing grain to the city. She also pleaded to Childeric for the welfare of prisoners-of-war, and met with a favorable response. Through her influence, Childeric and Clovis displayed unwonted clemency towards the citizens.\n\nGenevieve cherished a particular devotion to Saint Denis, and wished to erect a chapel in his honor to house his relics. Around 475 Genevieve purchased some land at the site of the saint's burial and exhorted the neighboring priests to use their utmost endeavors. When they replied that they had no lime, she sent them to the bridge of Paris, where they learned the whereabouts of large quantities of this material from the conversation of two swineherds. After this the building proceeded successfully. The small chapel became a famous place of pilgrimage during the fifth and sixth centuries.\n\nClovis I founded an abbey where Genevieve might minister, and where she herself was later buried. Under the care of the Benedictines, who established a monastery there, the church witnessed numerous miracles wrought at her tomb. As Genevieve was popularly venerated there, the church was rededicated in her name; people eventually enriched the church with their gifts. it was plundered by the Vikings in 847 and was partially rebuilt, but was completed only in 1177.\n\nIn 1129, when the city was suffering from an epidemic of ergot poisoning, this \"burning sickness\" was stayed after Saint Genevieve's relics were carried in a public procession. This was repeated annually with the relics being brought to the cathedral; Mme de Sévigné gave a description of the pageant in one of her letters. The relief from the epidemic is still commemorated in the churches of Paris.\nAfter the old church fell into decay, Louis XV ordered a new church worthy of the patron saint of Paris; he entrusted the Marquis of Marigny with the construction. The marquis gave the commission to his protégé Jacques-Germain Soufflot, who planned a neo-classical design. After Soufflot's death, the church was completed by his pupil, Jean-Baptiste Rondelet.\n\nThe Revolution broke out before the new church was dedicated. It was taken over in 1791 by the National Constituent Assembly and renamed the Panthéon, to be a burial place for distinguished Frenchmen. It became an important monument in Paris.\n\nThough Saint Genevieve's relics had been publicly burnt at the Place de Grève in 1793 during the French Revolution, the Panthéon was restored to Catholic purposes in 1821. In 1831 it was secularized again as a national mausoleum, but restored to the Catholic Church in 1852. Though the Communards had dispersed the relics, in 1885 the Catholic Church reconsecrated the structure to St Geneviève. Today, the Panthéon serves both religious and secular functions.\n\nAbout 1619 Louis XIII named Cardinal François de La Rochefoucauld abbot of Saint Genevieve's. The canons had been lax and the cardinal selected Charles Faure to reform them. This holy man was born in 1594, and entered the canons regular at Senlis. He was remarkable for his piety, and, when ordained, succeeded after a hard struggle in reforming the abbey. Many of the houses of the canons regular adopted his reform. In 1634, he and a dozen companions took charge of Saint-Geneviève-du-Mont of Paris. This became the mother-house of a new congregation, the Canons Regular of Ste. Genevieve, which spread widely over France.\n\nThe institute named after the saint was the Daughters of Ste. Geneviève, founded at Paris in 1636, by Francesca de Blosset, with the object of nursing the sick and teaching young girls. A somewhat similar institute, popularly known as the Miramiones, had been founded under the invocation of the Holy Trinity in 1611 by Marie Bonneau de Rubella Beauharnais de Miramion. These two institutes were united in 1665, and the associates called the Canonesses of Ste. Geneviève. The members took no vows, but merely promised obedience to the rules as long as they remained in the institute. Suppressed during the Revolution, the institute was revived in 1806 by Jeanne-Claude Jacoulet under the name of the Sisters of the Holy Family.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811564", "title": "Harry Hinsley", "text": "Harry Hinsley\n\nSir Francis Harry Hinsley OBE (26 November 1918 – 16 February 1998) was an English historian and cryptanalyst. He worked at Bletchley Park during the Second World War and wrote widely on the history of international relations and British Intelligence during the Second World War. He was known as Harry Hinsley.\n\nHinsley's father worked in the coal department of the Walsall Co-Op. His mother Emma Hinsley (née Adey) was a school caretaker, and they lived in Birchills, in the parish of St Andrew's, Walsall. Harry was educated at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, and in 1937 won a scholarship to read history at St. John's College, Cambridge. He went on to be awarded a First in part one of the Historical Tripos. \n\nIn August 1939 Hinsley visited his girlfriend in the German city of Koblenz. Police required him to report to the police station daily. However, this requirement was waived following the signing of the German-Soviet Pact. A week later Hinsley was advised by police via his girlfriend's parents to get out of Germany by 'tomorrow at the latest'. This enabled him to cross the Franco-German border before it was closed. He made the crossing at the bridge between Kehl and Strasbourg. Stripped of his Reichsmarks by German border guards without French Francs or British Pounds in exchange, Hinsley was left penniless. This led to his sleeping on a park bench in France. Hinsley hitch-hiked to Switzerland from where he returned to the United Kingdom. He made his return just before Britain declared war on Germany. In October 1939, while still at St. John's, he was summoned to an interview with Alastair Denniston, head of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), and was thereby recruited to Bletchley Park's naval section in Hut 4.\n\nAt Bletchley Park, Hinsley studied the external characteristics of intercepted German messages, a process sometimes termed \"traffic analysis\": from call signs, frequencies, times of interception and so forth, he was able to deduce a great deal of information about the structure of Nazi Germany's \"Kriegsmarine\"'s communication networks, and even about the structure of the German navy itself.\n\nHinsley helped initiate a programme of seizing Enigma machines and keys from German weather ships, such as the \"Lauenburg\", thereby facilitating Bletchley Park's resumption of interrupted breaking of German Naval Enigma.\n\nIn late 1943, Hinsley was sent to liaise with the US Navy in Washington, with the result that an agreement was reached in January 1944 to co-operate in exchanging results on Japanese Naval signals\n\nTowards the end of the war, Hinsley, by then a key aide to Bletchley Park chief Edward Travis, was part of a committee which argued for a post-war intelligence agency that would combine both signals intelligence and human intelligence in a single organisation. In the event, the opposite occurred, with GC&CS becoming GCHQ.\nOn 6 April 1946, Hinsley married Hilary Brett-Smith, a graduate from Somerville College, Oxford who had also worked at Bletchley Park, in Hut 8. They moved to Cambridge after the war where Hinsley had been elected a Fellow at St. John's College.\n\nHinsley was awarded the OBE in 1946, and was knighted in 1985.\n\nOn his death, Sir Harry Hinsley was cremated, and his family buried the ashes privately in Cambridge.\n\nAfter the war, Hinsley returned to St John's College and lectured in history, being in 1969 appointed \"Professor of the History of International Relations\". From 1979 to 1989 he was Master of St John's College and from 1981 to 1983 he was vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.\n\nIn 1962, Hinsley published \"Power and the Pursuit of Peace\", which is important as a study of early idealist thought about international relations.\n\nHinsley edited the multi-volume official history \"British Intelligence in the Second World War\", and argued that Enigma decryption had speeded Allied victory by 1–4 years while not fundamentally altering the war's outcome.\n\nHe was criticised by Marian Rejewski and Gordon Welchman, who took exception to inaccuracies in Hinsley's accounts of the history of Enigma decryption in the early volumes of his official history, including crucial errors in chronology. Subsequently, a revised account of the Polish, French and British contribution was included in volume 3, part 2.\n\nThe volumes of \"British Intelligence in the Second World War\" edited by Hinsley and published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) London are:\n\nHinsley also co-edited (with Alan Stripp) and contributed to \"Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park\", which contains personal accounts from those who worked at Bletchley Park.\n\nThe Hinsley Memorial Lecture, an annual lecture on an international relations topic, is held every year at St John's College in memory of Hinsley.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31509", "title": "Hulk (comics)", "text": "Hulk (comics)\n\nThe Hulk is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of \"The Incredible Hulk\" (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as independent personalities and resenting of the other.\n\nFollowing his accidental exposure to gamma rays during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast, including Banner's lover Betty Ross, his friend Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, sons Hiro-Kala and Skaar, and his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others.\n\nLee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most usual color is green. He has two main catchphrases: \"Hulk is strongest one there is!\" and the better-known \"Hulk smash!\", which has founded the basis for numerous pop culture memes.\n\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The most notable of these were the 1970s \"The Incredible Hulk\" television series, in which the character was portrayed by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno. The character was first played in a live-action feature film by Eric Bana, with Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo portraying the character in the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThe Hulk first appeared in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #1 (cover dated May 1962), written by writer-editor Stan Lee, penciled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby, and inked by Paul Reinman. Lee cites influence from \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in the Hulk's creation:\n\nKirby, commenting upon his influences in drawing the character, recalled as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car. Lee has also compared Hulk to the Golem of Jewish mythology. In \"The Science of Superheroes\", Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in \"Up, Up and Oy Vey\". This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.\n\nIn the debut, Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group. Colorist Stan Goldberg, however, had problems with the grey coloring, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green. Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 2, #302 (December 1984) reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. An exception is the early trade paperback, \"Origins of Marvel Comics\", from 1974, which explains the difficulties in keeping the grey color consistent in a Stan Lee written prologue, and reprints the origin story keeping the grey coloration. Since December 1984, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk's skin had initially been grey.\n\nLee gave the Hulk's alter ego the alliterative name \"Bruce Banner\" because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names. Despite this, in later stories he misremembered the character's name and referred to him as \"Bob Banner\", an error which readers quickly picked up on. The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name \"Robert Bruce Banner.\"\n\nThe Hulk's original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and Steve Ditko penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in \"The Fantastic Four\" #12 (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, appearing in the first two issues of the team's eponymous series (Sept. and Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issue #3 and as an ally in #5 (Jan.–May 1964). He then guest-starred in \"Fantastic Four\" #25–26 (April–May 1964), which revealed Banner's full name as Robert Bruce Banner, and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #14 (July 1964).\nAround this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot. Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.\n\nA year and a half after \"The Incredible Hulk\" was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in \"Tales to Astonish\", beginning in issue #60 (Oct. 1964).\n\nThis new Hulk feature was initially scripted by Lee, with pencils by Steve Ditko and inks by George Roussos. Other artists later in this run included Jack Kirby (#68–87, June 1965 – Oct. 1966); Gil Kane (credited as \"Scott Edwards\", #76, (Feb. 1966)); Bill Everett (#78–84, April–Oct. 1966); John Buscema (#85–87); and Marie Severin. The \"Tales to Astonish\" run introduced the super-villains the Leader, who would become the Hulk's nemesis, and the Abomination, another gamma-irradiated being. Marie Severin finished out the Hulk's run in \"Tales to Astonish\". Beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 2, and ran until 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and launched \"Hulk\" #1. Marvel filed for a trademark for \"The Incredible Hulk\" in 1967, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970.\n\nLen Wein wrote the series from 1974 through 1978, working first with Herb Trimpe, then, as of issue #194 (December 1975), with Sal Buscema, who was the regular artist for ten years. Issues #180–181 (Oct.–Nov. 1974) introduced Wolverine as an antagonist, who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. In 1977, Marvel launched a second title, \"The Rampaging Hulk\", a black-and-white comics magazine. This was originally conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in \"Tales to Astonish\". After nine issues, the magazine was retitled \"The Hulk!\" and printed in color.\n\nIn 1977, two Hulk television films were aired to strong ratings, leading to an \"Incredible Hulk\" TV series which aired from 1978 to 1982. A huge ratings success, the series introduced the popular Hulk catchphrase, \"Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry\", and broadened the character's popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness.\n\nBill Mantlo became the series' writer for five years beginning with issue #245 (March 1980). Mantlo's \"Crossroads of Eternity\" stories (#300–313, Oct. 1984 – Nov. 1985) explored the idea that Banner had suffered child abuse. Later Hulk writers Peter David and Greg Pak have called these stories an influence on their approaches to the character. Mantlo left the series for \"Alpha Flight\" and that series' writer John Byrne took over \"The Incredible Hulk\". The final issue of Byrne's six issue run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. Writer Peter David began a twelve-year run with issue #331 (May 1987). He returned to the Roger Stern and Mantlo abuse storylines, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering dissociative identity disorder (DID).\n\nIn 1998, David killed off Banner's long-time love Betty Ross. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to pursue the return of the Savage Hulk. David disagreed, leading to his parting ways with Marvel. Also in 1998, Marvel relaunched \"The Rampaging Hulk\" as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine. \"The Incredible Hulk\" was again cancelled with issue #474 of its second volume in March 1999 and was replaced with new series, \"Hulk\" the following month, with returning writer Byrne and art by Ron Garney. By issue #12 (March 2000), \"Hulk\" was retitled as \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 3 New series writer Paul Jenkins developed the Hulk's multiple personalities, and his run was followed by Bruce Jones with his run featuring Banner being pursued by a secret conspiracy and aided by the mysterious Mr. Blue. Jones appended his 43-issue \"Incredible Hulk\" run with the limited series \"Hulk/Thing: Hard Knocks\" #1–4 (Nov. 2004 – Feb. 2005), which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus. Peter David, who had initially signed a contract for the six-issue \"Tempest Fugit\" limited series, returned as writer when it was decided to make that story the first five parts of the revived volume three. After a four-part tie-in to the \"House of M\" storyline and a one-issue epilogue, David left the series once more, citing the need to do non-Hulk work for the sake of his career.\n\nWriter Greg Pak took over the series in 2006, leading the Hulk through several crossover storylines including \"Planet Hulk\" and \"World War Hulk\", which left the Hulk temporarily incapacitated and replaced as the series' title character by the demigod Hercules in the retitled \"The Incredible Hercules\" (Feb. 2008). The Hulk returned periodically in \"Hulk\", which then starred the new Red Hulk. In September 2009, \"The Incredible Hulk\" was relaunched as \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 2, #600. The series was retitled \"The Incredible Hulks\" with issue #612 (Nov. 2010) to encompass the Hulk's expanded family, and ran until issue #635 (Oct. 2011) when it was replaced with \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 4, (15 issues, Dec. 2011 – Dec. 2012) written by Jason Aaron with art by Marc Silvestri. As part of Marvel's 2012 Marvel NOW! relaunch, a series called \"The Indestructible Hulk\" (Nov. 2012) debuted under the creative team of Mark Waid and Leinil Yu. This series was replaced in 2014 with \"The Hulk\" by Waid and artist Mark Bagley.\n\nDuring the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Robert Bruce Banner saves teenager Rick Jones who has driven onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is hit with the blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later seemingly unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form. A pursuing soldier dubs the creature a \"hulk\". Originally, it was believed that Banner's transformations into the Hulk were caused by sunset and undone at sunrise, but later, after Rick witnessed Banner turn into Hulk at daytime following a failed attempt by Ross' men to shoot the Hulk into space, it was discovered to be caused by anger. Banner was cured in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #4, but chose to restore Hulk's powers with Banner's intelligence. The gamma-ray machine needed to affect the transformation-induced side effects that made Banner temporarily sick and weak when returned to his normal state.\n\nIn \"The Avengers\" #1 (September 1963), the Hulk became a founding member of the title's eponymous superhero team. By \"The Avengers\" #3, overuse of the gamma ray machine rendered the Hulk as an uncontrollable, rampaging monster, subject to spontaneous changing. In \"Tales to Astonish\" #59 (September 1964) the Hulk appeared as an antagonist for Giant-Man. The series established stress as the trigger for Banner turning into the Hulk and vice versa. It was during this time that the Hulk developed a more savage and childlike personality, shifting away from his original portrayal as a brutish but not entirely unintelligent figure. Also, his memory, both long-term and short-term, would now become markedly impaired in his Hulk state. \"Tales to Astonish\" #64 (February 1965) was the last Hulk story to feature him speaking in complete sentences. In \"Tales to Astonish\" #77 (March 1966), Banner's and the Hulk's dual identity became publicly known when Rick Jones, mistakenly convinced that Banner was dead (when he actually had been catapulted into the future), told Major Glenn Talbot, a rival to Banner for the affections of Betsy Ross, the truth. Consequently, Glenn informed his superiors and that turned Banner into a wanted fugitive upon returning to the present.\n\nThe 1970s saw Banner and Betty nearly marry in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #124 (February 1970). Betty ultimately married Talbot in issue #158 (Dec. 1972). The Hulk also traveled to other dimensions, one of which had him meet empress Jarella, who used magic to bring Banner's intelligence to the Hulk, and came to love him. The Hulk helped to form the Defenders.\n\nIn the 1980s, Banner once again gained control over the Hulk, and gained amnesty for his past rampages; however, due to the manipulations of supernatural character Nightmare, Banner eventually lost control over the Hulk. It was also established that Banner had serious mental problems even before he became the Hulk, having suffered childhood traumas that engendered Bruce's repressed rage. Banner comes to terms with his issues for a time, and the Hulk and Banner were physically separated by Doc Samson. Banner is recruited by the U.S. government to create the Hulkbusters, a government team dedicated to catching the Hulk. Banner finally married Betty in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #319 (May 1986) following Talbot's death in 1981. Banner and the Hulk were reunited in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #323 (Sep. 1986) and with issue #324, returned the Hulk to his grey coloration, with his transformations once again occurring at night, regardless of Banner's emotional state. In issue #347 the grey Hulk persona \"Joe Fixit\" was introduced, a morally ambiguous Las Vegas enforcer and tough guy. Banner remained repressed in the Hulk's mind for months, but slowly began to reappear.\n\nThe 1990s saw the Green Hulk return. In issue #377 (Jan. 1991), the Hulk was revamped in a storyline that saw the personalities of Banner, Grey Hulk, and Savage Hulk confront Banner's past abuse at the hands of his father Brian and a new \"Guilt Hulk\" persona. Overcoming the trauma, the intelligent Banner, cunning Grey Hulk, and powerful Savage Hulk personalities merge into a new single entity possessing the traits of all three. The Hulk also joined the Pantheon, a secretive organization of superpowered individuals. His tenure with the organization brought the Hulk into conflict with a tyrannical alternate future version of himself called the Maestro in the 1993 \"Future Imperfect\" miniseries, who rules over a world where many heroes are dead.\n\nIn 2000, Banner and the three Hulks (Savage Hulk, Grey Hulk, and the \"Merged Hulk\", now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor) become able to mentally interact with one another, each personality taking over the shared body as Banner began to weaken due to his suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. During this, the four personalities (including Banner) confronted yet another submerged personality, a sadistic \"Devil\" intent on attacking the world and attempting to break out of Banner's fracturing psyche, but the Devil was eventually locked away again when the Leader was able to devise a cure for the disease using genes taken from the corpse of Brian Banner. In 2005, it is revealed that the Nightmare has manipulated the Hulk for years, and it is implied that some or all of the Hulk's adventures written by Bruce Jones may have been just an illusion.\n\nIn 2006, the Illuminati decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth and send him away by rocket ship which crashes on Planet Sakaar ushering in the \"Planet Hulk\" storyline that saw the Hulk find allies in the Warbound, and marry alien queen Caiera, a relationship that was later revealed to have born him two sons: Skaar and Hiro-Kala. After the Illuminati's ship explodes and kills Caiera, the Hulk returns to Earth with his superhero group Warbound and declares war on the planet in \"World War Hulk\" (2007). However, after learning that Miek, one of the Warbound, had actually been responsible for the destruction, the Hulk allows himself to be defeated, with Banner subsequently redeeming himself as a hero as he works with and against the new Red Hulk to defeat the new supervillain team the Intelligencia.\n\nIn the 2010s, Hiro-Kala traveled to Earth to destroy the OldStrong Power wielded by Skaar, forcing Skaar and the Hulk to defeat and imprison him within his home planet.\n\nDuring the 2011 \"Fear Itself\" storyline, the Hulk finds one of the Serpent's magical hammers associated with the Worthy and becomes Nul: Breaker of Worlds. As he starts to transform, the Hulk tells the Red She-Hulk to run far away from him. Rampaging through South and Central America, Nul was eventually transported to New York City where he began battling Thor, with aid of the Thing, who was transformed into Angrir: Breaker of Souls. After defeating the Thing, Thor stated that he never could beat the Hulk, and instead removed him from the battle by launching him into Earth orbit, after which Thor collapsed from exhaustion. Landing in Romania, Nul immediately began heading for the base of the vampire-king Dracula. Opposed by Dracula's forces, including a legion of monsters, Nul was seemingly unstoppable. Only after the intervention of Raizo Kodo's Forgiven was Nul briefly slowed. Ultimately, Nul makes his way to Dracula's castle where the timely arrival of Kodo and Forgiven member Inka, disguised as Betty Ross, is able to throw off the effects of the Nul possession. Throwing aside the hammer, the Hulk regains control, and promptly leaves upon realizing \"Betty's\" true nature.\n\nWith the crisis concluded, the Hulk contacted Doctor Doom for help separating him and Banner for good in return for an unspecified favour. Doom proceeded to perform brain surgery on the Hulk, extracting the uniquely Banner elements from the Hulk's brain and cloning a new body for Banner. When Doctor Doom demands to keep Banner for his own purposes, the Hulk reneges on the deal and flees with Banner's body, leaving his alter ego in the desert where he was created to ensure that Doctor Doom cannot use Banner's intellect. When Banner goes insane due to his separation from the Hulk, irradiating an entire tropical island trying to recreate his transformation- something he cannot do as the cloned body lacks the genetic elements of Banner that allowed him to process the gamma radiation- the Hulk is forced to destroy his other side by letting him be disintegrated by a gamma bomb, prompting the Hulk to accuse Doom of tampering with Banner's mind, only for Doom to observe that what was witnessed was simply Banner without the Hulk to use as a scapegoat for his problems. Initially assuming that Banner is dead, the Hulk soon realizes that Banner was somehow \"re-combined\" with him when the gamma bomb disintegrated Banner's body, resulting in the Hulk finding himself waking up in various strange locations, including helping the Punisher confront a drug cartel run by a mutated dog, hunting sasquatches with Kraven the Hunter, and being forced to face Wolverine and the Thing in an old SHIELD base. Banner eventually leaves a video message for the Hulk in which he apologizes for his actions while they were separate, having come to recognize that he is a better person with the Hulk than without, the two joining forces to thwart the Doombots' attempt to use the animals on Banner's irradiated island as the basis for a new gamma army using a one-of-a-kind gamma cure Banner had created to turn all the animals back to normal. Following this, Bruce willingly joined the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D., allowing them to use the Hulk as a weapon in exchange for providing him with the means and funding to create a lasting legacy for himself.\n\nAfter the Hulk had suffered brain damage upon being shot in the head by the Order of the Shield- the assassin having been carefully trained to target Bruce at just the right part of the brain to incapacitate him without triggering a transformation- Iron Man used the Extremis to cure the Hulk. This procedure also increased Banner's mental capacity, which gave him the intelligence to tweak the Extremis virus within him and unleash a new persona for the Hulk: the super-intelligent Doc Green.\n\nDuring the 2014 \"Original Sin\" storyline, Bruce Banner confronted by the eye of the murdered Uatu the Watcher. Bruce temporarily experienced some of Tony Stark's memories of their first meeting before either of them became the Hulk or Iron Man. During this vision, Bruce witnessed Tony modifying the gamma bomb to be more effective prompting Bruce to realize that Tony was essentially responsible for him becoming the Hulk in the first place. Subsequent research reveals that Tony's tampering had actually refined the bomb's explosive potential so that it would not disintegrate everyone within the blast radius, with the result that Tony's actions had actually saved Bruce's life.\n\nIn the 2014 \"AXIS\" storyline, when a mistake made by the Scarlet Witch causes various heroes and villains to experience a moral inversion, Bruce Banner attended a meeting between Nick Fury Jr. and Maria Hill of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers who refused to turn over Red Skull. Later when he sided with Edwin Jarvis and tried to prevent his teammates from executing the Red Skull, the Hulk was thrown aside by Luke Cage. The Hulk's sorrow at his friends' betrayal awakened a new persona known as the bloodthirsty Kluh (described as the Hulk's Hulk, being the ruthless part of himself that even the Hulk repressed) with this new version easily defeating the Avengers, sneering that the Hulk they knew was nothing more than a \"sad piece of 'Doc Green's' ID.\" Kluh then leaves to wreak havoc, with Nova attempting to stop him after witnessing his rampage with the remaining good heroes. As with the other inverted Avengers and X-Men, Kluh was restored to Hulk when Brother Voodoo was summoned back to life by Doctor Doom so that Daniel Drumm's ghost can possess the Scarlet Witch and undo the inversion.\n\nWith his newfound intellect, Doc Green came to the conclusion that the world was in danger by Gamma Mutates and thus needed to be depowered. He developed a serum made from Adamantium nanobites that absorbed gamma energy. He used these to depower Red Leader, Red She-Hulk, Red Hulk, Skaar, Gamma Corps, and A-Bomb, but decided to 'spare' She-Hulk as he concluded that she was the one gamma mutation whose life had been legitimately improved by her mutation. At the close of the storyline, Doc Green discovered that he was beginning to disappear as the result of the Extremis serum wearing off. He ultimately allowed himself to fade away, returning to his normal Hulk form, as he feared that remaining at his current intellectual level would lead to him becoming the Maestro.\n\nDuring the 2015 \"Secret Wars\" storyline, the Hulk took part in the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. The Hulk used the \"Fastball Special\" with Colossus to destroy the Triskelion.\n\nAs part of the 2015–2018 \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" branding, Amadeus Cho becomes the new Hulk. Flashbacks reveal that the Hulk had absorbed a dangerous new type of radiation while helping Iron Man and the Black Panther deal with a massive accident on Kiber Island. Fearing the Hulk's meltdown would kill countless innocents, Cho was able to use special nanites to absorb the Hulk from Banner and take it into himself to become his own version of the Hulk, leaving Banner normal and free from the Hulk. He is then rescued from a bar fight by Amadeus, who tells him that he is cured. Having confirmed that he can no longer transform or sense the Hulk, Bruce spends some time travelling across America taking various risks such as driving at high speeds, running away from a bear, or gambling in Las Vegas, until he is confronted by Tony Stark out of concern that Bruce has a death wish. Bruce instead acknowledges that he still harbors guilt and rage over how so many of the Hulk's rampages were provoked by various agencies refusing to leave him alone.\n\nDuring the 2016 \"Civil War II\" storyline, the vision of the Inhuman Ulysses shows a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the superheroes. Meanwhile, Bruce Banner is shown to have set up a laboratory in Alpine, Utah, where he is approached by Captain Marvel, followed by Tony Stark, the rest of the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Inhumans. The confrontation leads to the Beast hacking into Banner's work servers and the revelation that he had been injecting himself with dead gamma-irradiated cells. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Maria Hill places him under arrest. Banner gets infuriated at all these events, when suddenly, Hawkeye shoots Banner with an arrow to the head and then to the heart, killing him, much to the dismay and horror of the superheroes, especially Tony Stark. At an Avengers-presided tribunal, Hawkeye states that Bruce Banner had approached him and ordered him to kill him if he ever showed signs of turning into the Hulk again. At the funeral, Korg of the Warbound stated how Hulk wanted to be left alone and how his allies that he made along the way have become his family. In his video will, Bruce leaves various items to other heroes and his allies including leaving Doctor Strange his notes on the Hulk's ability to perceive ghosts and an egg-timer for the various former/current other Hulks (based on one of Bruce's more successful attempts to control himself as he would sit down for three minutes doing nothing before making a particularly big decision and then decide if he still wanted to do it).\n\nFollowing the funeral of Bruce Banner, the Hand in allegiance with Daniel Drumm's ghost steal Bruce Banner's body in order to use the dead to bolster their ranks. When the reassembled Uncanny Avengers went to Japan and attempted to enlist Elektra for help in stopping the Hand, the ritual that the Hand performed has been completed as the Uncanny Avengers are attacked by a revived Hulk who is wearing samurai armor. The Uncanny Avengers were able to contain Hulk's rampage and sever his mystical link to the Beast of the Hand. Afterwards, Hulk regressed back to Bruce Banner and returned to the dead.\n\nDuring the 2017 \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Arnim Zola used an unknown method to temporary revive Bruce Banner where the Hydra Supreme version of Captain America persuades his Hulk side to attack the Underground's hideout called the Vault. He fought Thing and Giant-Man's A.I.Vengers until the temporary revival that Arnim Zola did to Bruce Banner started to wear off and cause Hulk to die again.\n\nDuring the \"No Surrender\" arc, the exiled Elder of the Universe named Challenger revives Hulk to be his ace in the hole during a contest between his Black Order and Grandmaster's Lethal Legion. Hulk participated since he knew that Earth will be destroyed either way while his Bruce Banner suspects that Hulk's revivals were a manifestation of Hulk's immortality. While defeating Cannonball and Living Lightning, breaking Vision, and draining the gamma energy out of Robert Maverick's Hulk Plug-In, Wonder Man successfully reasoned with him as Hulk destroyed the Pyarmoid in Voyager's possession. After feeling remorse for what happened, Bruce Banner became Hulk and faced off against Challenger. After Challenger sent Hulk into Earth's orbit, Hulk was pleased that he managed to hurt Challenger.\n\nWhile maintaining a low profile, Bruce Banner was shot by Tommy Hill of the Dogs of Hell biker gang during a robbery that also claimed the lives of Sandy Brockhurst and Josh Alfaro. He came back to life and turned into Hulk where he badly beat up Tommy Hill. The witnesses in the Dogs of Hell told Detective Gloria Mayes of the attacker as she and reporter Jackie McGee have a suspicion that it was Hulk even though Banner is believed to be dead.\n\nA number of alternate universes and alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Hulk, in which the character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.\n\nIn some versions, the Hulk succumbs to the darker side of his nature: in \"Future Imperfect\" (December 1992), a future version of the Hulk has become the Maestro, the tyrannical and ruthless ruler of a nuclear war-irradiated Earth, and in \"Old Man Logan\" (2008), an insane Hulk rules over a post-apocalyptic California, and leads a gang of his inbred Hulk children created with his first cousin She-Hulk.\n\nLike other long-lived characters, the Hulk's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, adding or modifying character traits. The Hulk is typically seen as a hulking man with green skin, wearing only a pair of torn purple pants that survive his physical transformation. As the character progressed, other outfits were designed that could stretch to accommodate the transformations back and forth. As Bruce Banner, the character is approximately 5'9\" tall and weighs 128Ibs, but when transformed into the Hulk, the character can stand between 7–8 feet tall and weigh up to 1,400Ibs. Following his debut, Banner's transformations were triggered at nightfall, turning him into a grey-skinned Hulk. In \"Incredible Hulk\" #2, the Hulk started to appear with green skin, and in \"Avengers\" #3 (1963) Banner realized that his transformations were now triggered by surges of adrenaline in response to feelings of fear, pain or anger. \"Incredible Hulk\" #227 (1978) established that the Hulk's separate personality was not due to the mutation affecting his brain, but because Banner was suffering from multiple personality disorder, with the savage Green Hulk representing Banner's repressed childhood rage and aggression, and the Grey Hulk representing Banner's repressed selfish desires and urges.\n\nDuring his decades of publication, Banner has been portrayed differently, but common themes persist. Banner, a physicist, is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in \"Incredible Hulk\" #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions. Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes. Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: \"Robert Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he can't form meaningful bonds with anyone.\" As a child, Banner's father Brian often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the psychological complex of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.\n\nThe original Grey Hulk was shown as average in intelligence who roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at \"puny\" humans who took him for a dangerous monster. Shortly after becoming the Hulk, his transformation continued turning him green, coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech, and by \"Incredible Hulk\" #4, radiation treatments gave Banner's mind complete control of the Hulk's body. While Banner relished his indestructibility and power, he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form and while he became known as a hero alongside the Avengers, his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group, believing he would never be trusted.\n\nOriginally, the Hulk was shown as simple minded and quick to anger. The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banner's, decrying Banner as \"puny Banner.\" From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly. Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the \"dark, primordial side of Banner's psyche.\" Even in the earliest appearances, Hulk spoke in the third person. Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences, and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has, when the Hulk says, \"But these muscles ain't just for show! All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin'!\" In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played with the nature of his transformations, briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form. Artistically and conceptually, the character has become progressively more muscular and powerful in the years since his debut.\n\nOriginally, Stan Lee wanted the Hulk to be grey but due to ink problems, Hulk's color was changed to green. This was later changed in story to indicate that the Grey Hulk and the Savage Hulk are separate personalities or entities fighting for control in Bruce's subconscious. The Grey Hulk incarnation can do the more unscrupulous things that Robert Bruce Banner could not bring himself to do, with many sources comparing the Grey Hulk to the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. While the Grey Hulk still had the \"madder he gets, the stronger he gets\" part that is similar to the Savage Hulk, it is on a much slower rate. It is said by Leader that the Grey Hulk is stronger on nights of the New Moon and weaker on nights of the Full Moon. Originally, the night is when Bruce Banner becomes the Grey Hulk and changes back by dawn. In later comics, willpower or stress would have Robert Bruce Banner turn into the Grey Hulk. During one storyline where he was placed under a spell to prevent him turning back into Bruce Banner and publicly presumed dead when he was teleported away from a gamma bomb explosion that destroyed an entire town, the Grey Hulk adopted a specific name as Joe Fixit, a security guard for a Las Vegas casino owner, with the Grey Hulk often being referred to as Joe after these events.\n\nThe Gravage Hulk is the result of Robert Bruce Banner using the Gamma Projector on himself which merged his Savage Hulk and Grey Hulk personas. This form possesses the raw power of the Savage Hulk and the cunning intellect of the Grey Hulk. While he doesn't draw on anger to empower him, the Gravage Hulk persona draws on dimensional nexus energies to increase his level.\n\nThe Dark Hulk persona is the result of Hulk being possessed by Shanzar. This form has black skin and is viciously strong.\n\nConvinced that unaided, the Banner, Green Hulk and Grey Hulk identities would eventually destroy each other, Doc Samson uses hypnosis to merge the three to create a new single identity combining Banner's intelligence with the Grey Hulk's and Banner's attitudes, and the Green Hulk's body. This new or Merged Hulk considered himself cured and began a new life, but the merger was not perfect, and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person, and when overcome with rage, the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner's human body while still thinking himself the Hulk. The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and has a higher base line. While in a calm emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm. Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk, Robert Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry, he regresses back to Robert Bruce Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk.\n\nThe Green Scar persona is unleashed on Sakaar and is considered an enraged version of Gravage Hulk. In addition, he is an expert in armed combat like the use of swords and shields. Green Scar is also a capable leader and an expert strategist.\n\nKluh is described as the Hulk's Hulk. This form has black skin, red lines, and a mohawk. Kluh had incredible power where he bested the inverted Avengers and knocked around Nova and has normal intellect.\n\nDoc Green is a variation of the Merged Hulk persona that is the result of Extremis fixing Hulk's brain. This persona is powerful enough to destroy Tony Stark's mansion with one thunderclap.\n\nImmortal Hulk is the result of Bruce Banner and Hulk having been through different deaths and rebirths. This incarnation is articulate, smart, cunning, and does merciless attacks on those who do harm. Unlike the other Hulk incarnations, Immortal Hulk is content with waiting inside Bruce. If Bruce is injured by sunset, the Immortal Hulk will emerge with his transformation being limited to night-time.\n\nBanner is considered one of the greatest scientific minds on Earth, possessing \"a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test.\" Norman Osborn estimates that he is the fourth most-intelligent person on Earth. Banner holds expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physiology, and nuclear physics. Using this knowledge, he creates advanced technology dubbed \"Bannertech\", which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom. Some of these technologies include a force field that can protect him from the attacks of Hulk-level entities, and a teleporter.\n\nThe Hulk possesses the potential for seemingly limitless physical strength which is influenced by his emotional state, particularly his anger. This has been reflected in the repeated comment, \"The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\" The cosmically-powerful entity known as the Beyonder once analyzed the Hulk's physiology, and claimed that the Hulk's potential strength had \"no finite element inside.\" Hulk's strength has been depicted as sometimes limited by Banner's subconscious influence; when Jean Grey psionically \"shut Banner off\", Hulk became strong enough to overpower and destroy the physical form of the villain Onslaught. Writer Greg Pak described the Worldbreaker Hulk shown during \"World War Hulk\" as having a level of physical power where \"Hulk was stronger than any mortal—and most immortals—who ever walked the Earth\", and depicted the character as powerful enough to completely destroy entire planets. His strength allows him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents, and he has displayed superhuman speed. Exposure to radiation has also been shown to make the Hulk stronger.\n\nHis durability, regeneration, and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper. Hulk is resistant to injury or damage, though the degree to which varies between interpretations, but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures, nuclear explosions, and planet-shattering impacts. Despite his remarkable resiliency, continuous barrages of high-caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree while he can be temporarily subdued with intense attacks with chemical weapons such as anesthetic gases, although any interruption of such dosages will allow him to quickly recover. He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities, including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater, surviving unprotected in space for extended periods, and when injured, healing from most wounds within seconds, including, on one occasion, the complete destruction of most of his body mass. His future self, the \"Maestro\", was even eventually able to recover from being blown to powder. As an effect, he has an extremely prolonged lifespan.\n\nHe also possesses less commonly described powers, including abilities allowing him to \"home in\" to his place of origin in New Mexico; resist psychic control, or unwilling transformation; grow stronger from radiation or dark magic; punch his way between separate temporal or spatial dimensions; and to see and interact with astral forms. Some of these abilities were in later years explained as being related; his ability to home in on the New Mexico bomb site was due to his latent ability to sense astral forms and spirits, since the bomb site was also the place where the Maestro's skeleton was and Maestro's spirit was calling out to him in order to absorb his radiation.\n\nIn the first \"Hulk\" comic series, \"massive\" doses of gamma rays would cause the Hulk to transform back to Banner, although this ability was written out of the character by the 1970s.\n\nOver the long publication history of the Hulk's adventures, many recurring characters have featured prominently, including his best friend and sidekick Rick Jones, love interest and wife Betty Ross and her father, the often adversarial General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross. Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas. Banner is son to Brian, an abusive father who killed Banner's mother while she tried to protect her son from his father's delusional attacks, and cousin to Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk, who serves as his frequent ally. Banner had a stillborn child with Betty, while the Hulk has two sons with his deceased second wife Caiera Oldstrong, Skaar and Hiro-Kala, and his DNA was used to create a daughter named Lyra with Thundra the warrior woman.\n\n\"The Fantastic Four\" #12 (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with the Thing. Although many early Hulk stories involve Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often a radiation-based character, like the Gargoyle or the Leader, along with other foes such as the Toad Men, or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross' daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, Major Glenn Talbot, also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales. The Hulk's archenemies are the Abomination and the Leader. The Abomination is more monstrous and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure. The Leader is a super-genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the world.\n\nThe Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of iconic status by many within and outside the comic book industry. In 2003, \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" claimed the character had \"stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American pop culture.\" In 2008, the Hulk was listed as the 19th greatest comic book character by \"Wizard\" magazine. \"Empire\" magazine named him as the 14th-greatest comic-book character and the fifth-greatest Marvel character. In 2011, the Hulk placed No. 9 on IGN's list of \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\", and fourth on their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012.\n\nThe Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war. As well as being a reaction to the Cold War, the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised, and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction. In the Michael Nyman edited edition of \"The Guardian\", Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the September 11 attacks. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic \"Heroes\", claiming that his greater prominence, alongside Captain America, aided in \"stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist.\" In \"Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics\", Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: \"As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity, there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements in science may cost us.\" Daniels continues, \"The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age.\"\n\nIn \"Comic Book Nation\", Bradford Wright alludes to Hulk's counterculture status, referring to a 1965 \"Esquire\" magazine poll amongst college students which \"revealed that student radicals ranked Spider-Man and the Hulk alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons.\" Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of these are \"The Ballad of the Hulk\" by Jerry Jeff Walker, and the \"Rolling Stone\" cover for September 30, 1971, a full color Herb Trimpe piece commissioned for the magazine. The Hulk has been caricatured in such animated television series as \"The Simpsons\", \"Robot Chicken\", and \"Family Guy\", and such comedy TV series as \"The Young Ones\". The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation. For example, in a 2008 \"Daily Mirror\" review of an \"EastEnders\" episode, a character is described as going \"into Incredible Hulk mode, smashing up his flat.\" The Hulk, especially his alter-ego Bruce Banner, is also a common reference in rap music. The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in Dr. Dre's \"2001\", while more conventional references are made in Ludacris and Jermaine Dupri's popular single \"Welcome to Atlanta\".\n\nThe 2003 Ang Lee-directed \"Hulk\" film saw discussion of the character's appeal to Asian Americans. The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the \"subcurrent of repression\" that underscored the character of The Hulk, and how that mirrored his own experience: \"Growing up, my artistic leanings were always repressed—there was always pressure to do something 'useful,' like being a doctor.\" Jeff Yang, writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", extended this self-identification to Asian American culture, arguing that \"the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans—especially those who have entered creative careers, often against their parents' wishes.\"\n\nThere have been explorations about the real world possibility of Hulk's gamma-radiation based origin. In \"The Science of Superheroes\", Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk's powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of gamma radiation Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with adrenal glands and GFP. Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even convert energy into matter – a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. \"Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known.\"\n\nPrior to the debut of the Hulk in May 1962, Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name \"Hulk\", but had no direct relation.\n\n\nThe Hulk was ranked #1 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters in 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "1555946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1555946", "title": "Jimmy Snuka", "text": "Jimmy Snuka\n\nJames Reiher Snuka (born James Wiley Smith; May 18, 1943 – January 15, 2017), better known by the ring name Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, was a Fijian professional wrestler and actor.\n\nSnuka wrestled for several promotions from the 1970s to 2010s. He was best known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in the early to mid-1980s and was credited with introducing the high-flying style of wrestling to the WWF. He was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1996. Snuka was the inaugural ECW Heavyweight Champion (a title he held twice) in Eastern Championship Wrestling (later Extreme Championship Wrestling). His children, Jimmy Reiher, Jr. and Tamina Snuka, are also wrestlers.\n\nSnuka was indicted and arrested in September 2015 on third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges, in relation to the May 1983 death of his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino. Snuka pleaded not guilty, but was ultimately found unfit to stand trial in June 2016 due to being diagnosed with dementia. As his health declined, the charges were dismissed on January 3, 2017. He died twelve days later.\n\nSnuka was born in the British colony of Fiji on May 18, 1943 to Louisa Smith and Charles Thomas. Thomas was married to another woman, and Smith was engaged to Bernard Reiher. Before Snuka was born, his mother married Reiher. As a child, Snuka moved with his family to the Marshall Islands and then to Hawaii.\n\nSnuka was active in amateur bodybuilding in Hawaii in the 1960s. He also enjoyed some success as a professional bodybuilder, earning the titles of Mr. Hawaii, Mr. Waikiki and Mr. North Shore.\n\nSnuka opted to go into the more lucrative career of professional wrestling due to the uncertainty of his making a living in bodybuilding. While working at Dean Ho's gym in Hawaii, Snuka met many of the wrestlers who worked in the South Pacific region and decided to try the business. Snuka made his debut as Jimmy Kealoha fighting Maxwell \"Bunny\" Butler in Hawaii in 1970. He later moved to the mainland and wrestled for Don Owen’s NWA Pacific Northwest territory where he held the belt as Heavyweight Champion six times. He first won the title by pinning Bull Ramos on November 16, 1973. It was in this territory that Reiher transformed himself into Jimmy Snuka. Snuka also held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship six times with partner Dutch Savage. Snuka also had a two-year feud with another rookie, Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura.\n\nSnuka also wrestled in several other National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) regions, including Texas. In 1977, he won both the Texas Heavyweight and Tag Team titles. Snuka then left for the Mid-Atlantic where he formed a tag team with Paul Orndorff. In their first television match they defeated the NWA World Tag Team Champions Jack and Jerry Brisco in a non-title bout. Orndorff and Snuka defeated Baron von Raschke and Greg Valentine to become the tag team title holders in 1979. On September 1, 1979, Snuka defeated Ricky Steamboat to hold the United States title. Snuka also formed a tag team with Ray Stevens while with this promotion. His career eventually led him to Georgia, where he teamed with Terry Gordy to win the NWA National Tag Team Championship by defeating Ted DiBiase and Steve Olsonoski.\"\n\nIn January 1982, Snuka entered the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as a villainous character under the guidance of Captain Lou Albano. Snuka lost several title shots at WWF Champion Bob Backlund, including a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden on June 28, 1982 in which Snuka leapt from the top of the cage, and onto Backlund who managed to escape the cage for the win just seconds prior. The contest was declared Match of the Year by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\".\n\nEven though Snuka portrayed a violent villain, he won fans because of his athletic style. In a storyline in 1982, Buddy Rogers told Snuka that Albano was cheating him financially, and as a result, Snuka fired Albano. Snuka took on Rogers as his manager during the feud with Albano, Freddie Blassie, and Ray Stevens. The attack solidified Snuka's new role as a fan favorite seeking to settle the score. Snuka defeated Stevens in the majority of the series of matches between the two. He also faced several other of Albano's wrestlers, and defeated Albano in a steel cage match in Madison Square Garden.\n\nSnuka also feuded with Don Muraco in 1983, which began after Snuka entered the ring for a match against Don Kernodle on the June 18 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\" while Muraco, the Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, was being interviewed. Muraco, enraged at the perceived lack of respect, confronted Snuka at ringside, triggering a brawl. This feud led to a defining moment of Snuka's career on October 17, 1983, in a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden. The match ended in a loss for Snuka, but afterward he dragged Muraco back into the ring and connected with the most famous \"Superfly Splash\" of his career, off the top of the high steel cage. Future wrestling stars The Sandman, Mick Foley, Tommy Dreamer, and Bubba Ray Dudley were all in attendance at the event and cite this match as the reason they decided to aggressively pursue professional wrestling. Snuka was named the 1983 Wrestler of the Year by \"Victory Magazine\" (later renamed \"WWF Magazine\") for his efforts.\n\nIn June 1984, Snuka became embroiled in a feud with one of the WWF's top villains, \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper. In a segment of \"Piper's Pit\", Piper hit Snuka on the back of the head with a coconut. The attack led to a series of grudge matches between the two that were played out over venues across the US throughout the summer of 1984. In late 1984, Snuka entered a rehabilitation facility; the WWF created a storyline in which Piper had broken Snuka's neck by hitting him over the head with a chair. The Tonga Kid, who was billed as Snuka's nephew, continued the feud on Snuka's behalf.\n\nThe remainder of Snuka's initial WWF stint would see him frequently tangling with Piper one way or another, often via tag matches or wrestling Piper's closest ally, Bob Orton, Jr. Snuka defeated Orton at \"The War to Settle the Score\" on February 18, 1985; an injury during the match forced Orton to wear a cast on his left arm, which he continued to wear after the injury healed. The feud played a small part in the first ever WrestleMania in March 1985, when Snuka acted as a cornerman for Hulk Hogan and Mr. T when they defeated Piper and Paul Orndorff (with Orton in their corner). Snuka left the WWF in July 1985, though he still appeared in cartoon form when \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\" premiered in September.\n\nAfter spending the rest of 1985 and early 1986 competing for New Japan Pro Wrestling, Snuka resurfaced in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), replacing Jerry Blackwell as Greg Gagne's partner, to defeat Bruiser Brody and Nord the Barbarian in a tag team cage match at WrestleRock 86. Snuka split his time between the AWA and Japan throughout 1986 and 1987. His most notable feud in the AWA during that time was with Colonel DeBeers, who portrayed a racist and looked down on Snuka because of his skin color. This led the way for a series of grudge matches in 1987.\n\nSnuka re-emerged in the WWF at WrestleMania V on April 2, 1989. He made his televised return to action on the May 27 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", defeating Boris Zhukov. After a brief feud with The Honky Tonk Man, Snuka made his in-ring pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam against \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase. Snuka lost the match by count-out as a result of interference from DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil.\n\nBy the later part of 1989, Snuka was put into a spot like many veterans before him, being used to help put over other rising stars such as \"Mr. Perfect\" Curt Hennig. At the Survivor Series, Snuka and Hennig were each the final remaining members of their opposing teams, with Hennig pinning Snuka to win the match for his team. In January 1990, Snuka made his Royal Rumble match debut, lasting 17 minutes and eliminating two competitors before being eliminated by the eventual winner, Hulk Hogan. Snuka had his first WrestleMania match at WrestleMania VI, where he was defeated by Rick Rude. When the Intercontinental Championship was vacated after WrestleMania, Snuka entered the tournament to crown a new champion. He was eliminated in the first round when he once again lost to Mr. Perfect. At that November's Survivor Series, Snuka joined Jake Roberts and The Rockers in a losing effort against Rick Martel, The Warlord and Power and Glory.\n\nOn March 24, 1991, Snuka was defeated by The Undertaker at WrestleMania VII, which began Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania. In January 1992, he competed in the Royal Rumble for the vacant WWF Championship, but lasted only three minutes before being eliminated by Undertaker. Snuka left the WWF soon after, his last recorded match being a loss to Shawn Michaels at the Los Angeles Sports Arena on February 8, 1992.\n\nIn the midst of his ECW career, Snuka once again returned to the WWF on September 25, 1993, defeating Brian Christopher at a Madison Square Garden house show. He returned to television two nights later, defeating Paul Van Dale on the September 27 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\". The following week on \"Raw\", Snuka participated in a battle royal for the vacant Intercontinental Championship, in which he was eliminated by Rick Martel before departing the company.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF in March 1992, Snuka toured with various smaller organizations and played a role in the formation of Tod Gordon's Philadelphia-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) organization along with fellow veterans Don Muraco and Terry Funk. Snuka made his ECW debut as a fan favorite at a live event on April 25. He won his first match, a battle royal to qualify for the ECW Heavyweight Championship match against Salvatore Bellomo, the winner of the other battle royal. Immediately after, Snuka defeated Bellomo to become the promotion's first Heavyweight Champion. A day later, he dropped the title to Johnny Hotbody.\n\nHe returned to ECW on July 14, where he defeated Hotbody to regain the Heavyweight Title, winning it for a second time. He made his first successful title defense against Mr. Sandman on July 15. Snuka held the title for the next two months, defeating challengers like Super Destroyer #1 and King Kaluha, before losing the title to Don Muraco on September 30. Snuka unsuccessfully challenged Muraco for the title in a rematch on October 24, after which he turned into a villain by feigning confrontation with color commentator Stately Wayne Manor and then attacking ECW owner Tod Gordon with a chair. Snuka took on Hunter Q. Robbins III as his manager and closed the year with a loss to Davey Boy Smith on December 19.\n\nSnuka became a member of Paul E. Dangerously's new faction Hotstuff International on the debut episode of the company's eponymous television program \"Eastern Championship Wrestling\" on April 6 and won an eight-man tournament for the vacant Television Championship by defeating Larry Winters, the undefeated Tommy Cairo and Glen Osbourne. Snuka frequently teamed with his stablemates Eddie Gilbert and Don Muraco. Snuka made his first televised title defense against Osbourne on the May 25 episode of \"Eastern Championship Wrestling\", where Snuka retained the title. Snuka successfully defended the title against J.T. Smith and the NWA Pennsylvania Heavyweight Champion Tommy Cairo at Super Summer Sizzler, while also defending the title on \"Eastern Championship Wrestling\". Snuka lost the title to Terry Funk in a brutal steel cage match at .\n\nSnuka's next notable match took place at The Night The Line was Crossed in 1994, where he faced rising star Tommy Dreamer in an infamous match. During the match, Dreamer kicked out of a pinfall attempt by Snuka after a \"Superfly Splash\", thus marking one of the few times in wrestling history that an opponent kicked out of Snuka's finishing move. Snuka still managed to win by delivering three splashes. Snuka continued his assault on Dreamer after the match, which began a feud between the two. Snuka lost to Dreamer on March 5 before beating him in a steel cage match at Ultimate Jeopardy. Snuka wrestled his last ECW match at Hardcore Heaven in August, where he and The Tazmaniac picked up a tag team victory over The Pitbulls. Later that month, ECW was taken over by Paul Heyman, who renamed it Extreme Championship Wrestling.\n\nSnuka also appeared on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" January 10, 2000, where he gave Jeff Jarrett a Superfly Splash off the top of a steel cage.\n\nSnuka was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1996. Afterward, he competed at the 1996 Survivor Series.\n\nSnuka received a lifetime achievement award from WWE at Madison Square Garden on WWE Raw, August 26, 2002.\n\nIn 2005, he appeared at the \"WWE Homecoming\", where he delivered a Superfly Splash to Rob Conway. He was a part of the Taboo Tuesday pay-per-view, where fans voted for him (ahead of Kamala and Jim Duggan) to team with Eugene against Conway and Tyson Tomko. Snuka won the match, pinning Conway after a Superfly Splash.\n\nHe appeared at the 2007 WWE draft edition of \"Raw\" in a vignette for Vince McMahon appreciation night. On June 24, 2007, Snuka was introduced as Sgt. Slaughter's tag team partner in the open invitational match for the WWE Tag Team Championship at , but he was ultimately pinned by his son.\n\nIn 2008, Snuka appeared in the Royal Rumble. He was in the match less than 5 minutes and primarily focused his efforts on onetime nemesis, Roddy Piper. Both were quickly eliminated by the next entrant, Kane.\n\nOn the March 2, 2009 episode of \"Raw\", he was attacked by Chris Jericho during a parody of \"Piper's Pit\". This was part of a storyline where Jericho was disrespecting and attacking legends. Two weeks later, on the March 16, 2009 episode of \"Raw\", Snuka, Roddy Piper, Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat attacked Jericho. At WrestleMania XXV on April 5, 2009, Snuka teamed with Steamboat and Piper to face Jericho in a Legends of WrestleMania Handicap match with Flair in their corner. Snuka was the first eliminated by Jericho, who eventually won the match.\n\nSnuka made an appearance on an \"old school\" edition of \"Raw\" in November 2010, where he stood by his daughter Tamina, in the corner of The Usos during their match against Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov, which would be his final WWE appearance. \n\nFollowing his arrest in September 2015, WWE suspended his Legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) and removed his Hall of Fame page from its website. However, Snuka never stood trial due to his poor health, and after he died in January 2017, Snuka was honored with a video package, which is common for ex-WWE stars who have died, but was considered controversial by some people, due to the apparent murder of his girlfriend.\n\nSnuka continued to spend much of his time with East Coast Wrestling organizations through the late 1990s and into the 2000s. During this time, he wrestled the Metal Maniac in a series of matches that spanned across many independent wrestling promotions, winning most of these matches. On August 15, 1997, Snuka defeated The Masked Superstar at the \"IWA Night of the Legends\" show in Kannapolis, North Carolina via disqualification when his opponent hit special guest referee Ricky Steamboat.\n\nSnuka also participated at the first X Wrestling Federation TV tapings, accompanying his son, Jimmy Snuka, Jr. to the ring for matches, including one match where they both delivered the Superfly Splash to prone opponents. On June 22, 2002, Snuka won the International Wrestling Superstars (IWS) United States Championship by pin fall against King Kong Bundy in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On April 3, 2004, Snuka and Kamala fought to a no-contest at the International Wrestling Cartel's first-annual \"Night Of Legends\" event in Franklin, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2004, Snuka made an appearance for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at their Victory Road pay-per-view as Roddy Piper's guest on Piper's Pit.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, Snuka wrestled for 1PW's \"Fight Club 2\" event where he teamed with Darren Burridge to defeat Stevie Lynn and Jay Phoenix.\nIn 2008 he appeared in the Royal Rumble match. He didn’t last very long, having been eliminated by Kane.\n\nOn March 28, 2009, Snuka again participated at the IWC's \"Night Of Legends\" event, where he defeated former rival Bob Orton, Jr.. On August 1, Snuka teamed with Jon Bolen, Jimmy Vega$, and Michael Facade (with Dominic DeNucci) to defeat James Avery, Logan Shulo, Shane Taylor and Lord Zoltan (with Mayor Mystery) at IWC's \"No Excuses 5\" in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. On November 28, 2009, he teamed with his son at an NWA Upstate event in Lockport, New York. They defeated the NWA Upstate Tag Team Champions Hellcat and Triple X in a non-title match.\n\nIn 2011, Jimmy Snuka competed at \"JCW: Icons and Legends\" event competing in a Battle Royal match won by Zach Gowen. On May 11, 2014, Snuka teamed up with The Patriot to defeat the team of Brodie Williams and Mr. TA at a Big Time Wrestling event. Snuka continued wrestling on the independent circuit until mid-2015.\n\nSnuka was the part-owner of Body Slam University and Coastal Championship Wrestling in South Florida with Dan Ackerman and Bruno Sassi. He wrote an autobiography, \"Superfly: The Jimmy Snuka Story\", which was released on December 1, 2012.\n\nSnuka was married three times. His second marriage was to Sharon, with whom he had four children: Sarona, James, Jr., Liana, and Ata. His third marriage was to Carole on September 4, 2004. He was stepfather to Carole's three children: Bridget, Richard, and Dennis.\n\nOn May 10, 1983, a few hours after defeating José Estrada at a WWF TV taping at the Lehigh County Agricultural Hall in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Snuka placed a call for an ambulance. When emergency personnel arrived at his room at the George Washington Motor Lodge, they found that his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino, had been injured. She was transported to Allentown's Sacred Heart Medical Center, where she died shortly after of \"undetermined craniocerebral injuries.\" The coroner's report stated that Argentino, 23, died of traumatic brain injuries consistent with a moving head striking a stationary object. Autopsy findings show Argentino suffered more than two dozen cuts and bruises — a possible sign of serious domestic abuse — on her head, ear, chin, arms, hands, back, buttocks, legs, and feet. Forensic pathologist Isidore Mihalakis, who performed the autopsy, wrote at the time that the case should be investigated as a homicide until proven otherwise. Deputy Lehigh County coroner Wayne Snyder later said, \"Upon viewing the body and speaking to the pathologist, I immediately suspected foul play and so notified the district attorney.\"\n\nSnuka was the only suspect involved in the subsequent investigation. Although charges were not pressed at the time against Snuka, the case was left officially open. In 1985, Argentino’s parents won a $500,000 default judgment against Snuka in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. Snuka appears not to have ever paid, claiming financial inability. On June 28, 2013, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced that the still-open case would be reviewed by his staff. On January 28, 2014, Martin announced that the case had been turned over to a grand jury.\n\nOn September 1, 2015, 32 years after the incident, Snuka was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter for Argentino's death. It is the oldest case to result in charges in Lehigh County's history. On October 7, 2015, Snuka's lawyers agreed to forego a preliminary hearing, which the prosecution contended was a waste of court resources, given the thorough grand jury investigation. In return, they received transcripts and other evidence from that investigation, which defense attorney Robert J. Kirwan II said would be much more helpful in preparing Snuka's case than a hearing would have been.\n\nOn November 2, 2015, Snuka pleaded not guilty before Judge Kelly Banach. A hearing to determine Snuka's competency for trial began in May 2016. Snuka's attorneys argued that a forensic psychologist found Snuka's mental and physical health to be deteriorating. Prosecutors countered by showing a tape of Snuka performing wrestling moves at a May 2015 match. On June 1, 2016, Judge Banach ruled that Snuka was not mentally competent to stand trial for the murder and that a new hearing would be held six months later to re-evaluate his competency, though his attorneys maintained that his condition wouldn't improve over time. Judge Kelly Banach dismissed the charges on January 3, 2017, deeming Snuka not mentally fit to stand trial.\n\nIn August 2015, Snuka's wife, Carole, announced that he was diagnosed with stomach cancer. As a result, he had surgery to remove his lymph nodes, part of his stomach and all apparent cancer. She said they both expected he would fully recover after \"a long road ahead\". Following his arrest, his attorney, William E. Moore, told reporters Snuka has dementia, stemming from wrestling-related injuries, to the point of being unfit for trial, and a judge ultimately agreed. \n\nIn July 2016, Snuka, represented by his wife, was part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred \"long term neurological injuries\" and that the company \"routinely failed to care\" for them and \"fraudulently misrepresented and concealed\" the nature and extent of those injuries. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. According to a court document filed by Kyros in November 2016, Snuka was diagnosed with \"chronic traumatic encephalopathy or a similar disease\". WWE challenged the filing, stating that \"no medical report was included\" in it. Since the September 2007 autopsy on Chris Benoit that detected he had CTE, the diagnosis has become a major talking point in the industry, as over 60 wrestlers or estates of deceased wrestlers have entered into litigation against the WWE, according to Kyros. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. The decision is currently being appealed by Konstantine Kyros of Kyros Law Offices, PC, which is currently representing the wrestlers and their estates.\n\nOn December 2, 2016, it was announced that Snuka was in hospice and had six months left to live, due to a terminal illness. He died on January 15, 2017, at age 73 in Pompano Beach, Florida.\n\n\n\n"}

He serves as the main antagonist of the original \"Karate Kid\" film, a minor character in \"The Karate Kid Part II\" and one of the main protagonists of the \"Cobra Kai\" web television series.\n\nJohnny Lawrence was born in 1967. He moved to the upscale neighborhood of Encino, California, after his mother Laura married Hollywood producer Sid Weinberg. Johnny had no friends and was ridiculed by his stepfather, especially after quitting drum and magic lessons. He often used his Walkman to drown out Sid's heckling. One day in 1979, while riding his bicycle, a 12-year-old Johnny discovered the original Cobra Kai dojo and spent the next five years learning karate under sensei John Kreese.\n\nIn \"The Karate Kid\", Johnny is the top student of the Cobra Kai dojo, leader of the Cobra Kai gang, and two-time defending champion of the All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships tournament. Prior to the events of the film, he broke up with classmate Ali Mills after a two-year relationship. One night at a beach, Johnny confronts Ali over their breakup, but New Jersey native Daniel LaRusso interferes with the argument, and Johnny attacks him after Daniel sucker punches him in the face. Within the next few weeks, Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang harass Daniel in and out of school. It stops for a while, but Daniel soaks Johnny with a hose while he is rolling a joint at the Halloween dance, causing Johnny and the other Cobras to chase him down and beat him up until Mr. Miyagi, the maintenance man of Daniel's apartment, beats up the gang to save Daniel. The next day, Mr. Miyagi confronts Kreese and proposes to have Daniel and Johnny's feud settled in the upcoming tournament. Kreese agrees, but warns that if they do not show up at the tournament, both Daniel and Mr. Miyagi will be declared fair game to Cobra Kai. \n\nAt the tournament, Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against a highly skilled opponent. When Daniel reaches the semi-finals, Kreese instructs Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to put Daniel out of commission. Bobby reluctantly does an illegal kick to Daniel's knee, getting himself disqualified while Johnny looks at Kreese in disgust. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Ali informs the tournament announcer that Daniel will fight in the final round. During the fight, Daniel gets the upper hand and gives Johnny a bloody nose. Kreese orders Johnny to sweep Daniel's leg, an unethical move. Fearing his sensei, Johnny hits Daniel's bad leg with an elbow strike and receives a warning from the referee. Upon the restart of the round, Johnny loses the match after Daniel lands a crane kick to his face. Having gained respect for his nemesis, Johnny gives Daniel the trophy.\n\nIn \"The Karate Kid Part II\", Kreese harshly reprimands Johnny for losing to Daniel, breaking his second-place trophy in the process. The other Cobra Kai students plead for Kreese to let go of his stranglehold on Johnny until Mr. Miyagi intervenes in the incident. Mr. Miyagi dodges Kreese's punches, causing Kreese to injure his hands from breaking two car windows. He further humiliates Kreese by squeezing his nose. Following the incident, Johnny and his friends decide to leave the Cobra Kai dojo forever.\n\nIn \"Cobra Kai\", which takes place 34 years after the first film, Johnny is a down-on-his-luck alcoholic loner who is divorced and estranged from his teenage son Robby while struggling to make a living as a handyman in the San Fernando Valley. He appears to be oblivious to most current technology after the 1990s, as he still carries a flip phone and is unfamiliar with the Internet and social media platforms such as Facebook. One night, Johnny saves his teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz from a group of rich bullies at a strip mall after they shove Miguel against his red Pontiac Firebird, but is arrested in the process. He is bailed out by Sid, who offers to buy him out of his life with an undisclosed sum of money. Realizing he needs to reorganize his life, Johnny uses the money to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo, with Miguel as his first student. After Miguel beats up the rich bullies in the school lunchroom, dozens of other students flock to the dojo. \n\nJohnny tries to enter his dojo in the upcoming All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships tournament, but he discovers that Cobra Kai is serving a lifetime ban due to the ruthless actions of Kreese, Terry Silver, and their student Dynamite Mike Barnes from \"The Karate Kid Part III\". Johnny approaches the All Valley Committee and explains that his dojo is nothing like the original, considering that Kreese has been dead for years and he has never had any association with Silver or Barnes. Instead, Johnny explains that his dojo is under his sole authority and he endeavors to make a difference to students who have been bullied all their lives. Despite objections by Daniel, who serves as a member of the committee, the board votes to lift the ban and allow Cobra Kai to enter the tournament. As the dojo gains more students, Johnny earns enough money to keep it afloat and pay back Sid, vowing never to return to him again.\n\nWith that success, Johnny trains his dojo with even more rigor. However, his conflict with Daniel is exacerbated by a series of misunderstandings, culminating with Daniel's foolish cousin destroying Johnny's car and assaulting him supposedly in Daniel's name. Enraged, Johnny comes to Daniel's home to assault him, but Daniel's wife, Amanda, manages to quickly defuse the conflict by inviting Johnny to breakfast to discuss the matter peacefully and persuading her husband to give Johnny a car from the trade-in lot of his dealership as compensation. While test driving a 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T, Johnny and Daniel make considerable progress coming to terms, until their return to Daniel's residence leads to Johnny discovering that Robby is Daniel's protege. At that point, Johnny shoves Daniel in a rage, only to have Robby defend his teacher.\n\nAt the All Valley tournament, both Miguel and Eli (nicknamed Hawk) make it to semi finals, along with Robby. When Robby and Hawk fight, Hawk is disqualified for injuring Robby's shoulder with an illegal attack, leaving Robby and Miguel to meet in the final match. When Miguel ruthlessly exploits Robby's shoulder against his wishes, Johnny realizes that his teaching methods have been corrupting his students. Miguel wins the tournament and thanks Johnny for his guidance, but Johnny is too dejected by his actions to celebrate. He confronts Robby before he can leave the arena and apologizes to him, which Robby accepts with reasonable politeness. Later that night, his old sensei, John Kreese shows up at the dojo, telling him the real story is just beginning.\n\nThe character has been mostly positively received. Initially, he was seen a typical 1980s movie villain. Since the turn of the 21st century, he has being seen as a sort of sympathic antihero especially since the character's reappearance in \"Cobra Kai\". The perception that Johnny Lawrence was the real victim was parodied in \"How I Met Your Mother\" in the episode \"The Bro Mitzvah\".\n"}

As a young woman she kept house for a priest there until her marriage on 21 April 1806 to Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière. Lagimodière was originally from nearby Saint-Ours; he had become a Coureur des bois employed in the fur trade by the Hudson's Bay Company in Rupert's Land.\n\nImmediately following their marriage, and in defiance of the custom of the time, Gaboury travelled to the west with her new husband. They went first to the area near the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red Rivers near what would later become the Red River Colony, and, eventually, modern Winnipeg, Manitoba. They wintered at a Métis encampment near Pembina (under British sovereignty at the time but now in North Dakota), where the first of her eight children was born on 6 January 1807.\n\nThe following spring, the Lagimodières travelled to the valley of the Saskatchewan River, settling eventually in what is now northern Saskatchewan, where they remained until 1811, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle among other French-Canadian trappers and their native wives. During this period, Marie-Anne accompanied her husband on many trapping and buffalo hunting expeditions, often venturing as far west as present-day Alberta. Her second child was born on the open prairie shortly after her horse had bolted towards a herd of buffalo, and on another occasion she fought and shot a large bear that had attacked one of their companions.\n\nThe young family was once taken prisoner while trapping by Tsuu T'ina tribesmen because of their association with local Cree. Although they managed to escape on horseback, they were pursued for five days until reaching the safety of Fort des Prairie (also known as Fort Augustus, a counterpart to Fort Edmonton) near modern Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nBefore his marriage, Jean-Baptiste had previously been involved [in the style of the country] with a native woman who had borne his children. Marie-Anne was tolerant and accepting of the children arising from this previous relationship, although the other woman was jealous and reportedly threatened to poison her. Despite this incident, the Lagimodières generally had good relationships with the Aboriginal peoples they encountered. Marie-Anne was often regarded as an object of curiosity by the Natives during her travels, as she was invariably the first white woman they had ever seen – some were even led to believe that she possessed supernatural powers.\n\nOn hearing that Lord Selkirk was establishing a permanent colony at the Red River, they returned to help establish the new Red River Colony in the spring of 1812. The early history of the settlement was characterized by struggles between the Hudson's Bay Company and its rival, the North West Company, culminating in the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. Although the Lagimodières managed to avoid involvement with the violent confrontations, Jean-Baptiste was asked by HBC representative Colin Robertson to take news of the events to Lord Selkirk. Over the winter of 1815–1816, Lagimodière travelled over 2,900 kilometers on horseback and on foot in fulfillment of this mission. During this time, Marie-Anne was obliged to seek shelter among the aboriginal tribes when the Nor'Westers took possession of Fort Douglas. On his return from the east, Jean-Baptiste was taken prisoner by the Nor'Westers and was imprisoned in Fort William until August 1816. The Lagimodières were not reunited until September 1816, after the unrest had subsided.\n\nIn recognition of his service, Lord Selkirk awarded Jean-Baptiste a tract of land near the Red River, which the Lagimodières successfully homesteaded for many years. They had six more children, including, in 1822, Julie Lagimodière, the future mother of Louis Riel. Dying at age 95 in 1875, Marie-Anne lived to see Manitoba become part of the Canadian Confederation following Riel's actions during the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870.\n\nShe is sometimes remembered as the \"Grandmother of the Red River\", and many of the Métis people of the Canadian Prairies can trace their ancestry to her.\n\nÉcole Marie-Anne-Gaboury, a French immersion elementary school in St. Vital, Winnipeg, Manitoba was named in her honour, as is Rue Marie Anne Gaboury in Bonnie Doon, Edmonton, Alberta which is the home to the French-language section of the University of Alberta, the Campus Saint-Jean.\n\nThe 1978 Canadian feature film \"Marie-Anne\" tells a fictionalized story of \"the first white woman in Western Canada\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27995041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27995041", "title": "Masortim", "text": "Masortim\n\nMasortim (, lit. \"Traditional [people]\", also known as Shomrei Masoret, , \"upholders of tradition\")' is an Israeli term of self-definition, describing the Israeli Jews who perceive and define themselves as neither strictly religious (\"Dati\") nor secular (\"Hiloni\").\n\nMasortim observe a number of \"minhagim\" and several basic religious commandments that are the most recognizable symbols of the Jewish tradition. In doing so, they seek to express their affinity to the Jewish people and especially their will to continue their families' religious customs and traditions, as they maintain that there is a need to preserve the traditional values and customs, in order to guard the continuity of the existence of the Jewish people.\n\nMasortim are distinct from Conservative Judaism, which is sometimes called \"Masorti Judaism\".\n\nThe majority of \"Shomrei Masoret\" are Mizrahi Jews, i.e. those of oriental origin (i.e. Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa). The exact number of the \"Masortim\" is hard to determine, since it is based upon the self-definition of the participants in surveys. However, according to Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2006, 39% of the Jewish population within Israel define themselves as Masortim. Pew Research Center estimates the masorti at 29% of Jews in Israel (or 23% of all Israeli adults).\n\n\"Shomrei Masoret\" perceive the preservation of the Jewish tradition, minhagim, and family customs, as an educational and a Family value.\n\nThe tradition, minhagim, and family customs is also relevant in terms of the Jewish denomination of origin affiliation, and thus the percentage of \"Shomrei Masoret\" is especially high among the Mizrahi denomination of origin affiliation. Many of them (and their offspring) define themselves as \"Shomer Masoret\" (or \"Masorati\"), even if some or part of their lifestyle's customs are generally accounted as secular (\"Hiloni\"), still, they pay heed to preserving and keeping the Jewish Tradition heritage as it was observed in their or their parents' country of origin. In that conjunction, one should mention the political party of \"Shas\" (a religious-Orthodox Mizrahi-denomination political party), who raised the banner of \"\" (\"Restore Past Glory\"), a slogan that swept many non-religious-Orthodox Mizrahi-denomination voters, who, nevertheless, see the importance of preserving their Jewish Tradition denomination.\n\nOne may not find many Ashkenazi (European origin) Israelis defining themselves as \"Shomer Masoret\" (or \"Masorati\"). This is because, among other reasons, the dichotomy that was created after the Age of Enlightenment, between Secular, Reform and Orthodox European Jews, was a dichotomy that did not exist among the Middle Eastern Jews.\n\nMasortim are not a denomination of Judaism but rather a sociological group that exists only in Israel, and their attitude towards the religious observance has much do with one's personal preferences and tendencies, and in the context of their desire to see themselves as part of the comprehensive Jewish religious system, without being obligated to full observance of the religious commandments (613 Mitzvot). Every Masorti has his/her own level of observance, which depends only on one's own free will and one's personal selection of what is perceived by him/her as a relevant religious commandment, tradition or custom of Orthodox Judaism.\n\nNevertheless, one may ascribe to the majority of them, a notable distinguishing quality – the preservation of the basic Jewish traditional \"minhagim\", that are accounted as the most recognizable elements of Orthodox Judaism:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33949468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33949468", "title": "Mathew Charles Lamb", "text": "Mathew Charles Lamb\n\nMathew Charles \"Matt\" Lamb (5 January 1948 – 7 November 1976) was a Canadian spree killer who, in 1967, avoided Canada's then-mandatory death penalty for capital murder by being found not guilty by reason of insanity. Abandoned by his teenage mother soon after his birth in Windsor, Ontario, Lamb suffered an abusive upbringing at the hands of his step-grandfather, leading him to become emotionally detached from his relatives and peers. He developed violent tendencies that manifested themselves in his physical assault of a police officer at the age of 16 in February 1964, and his engaging in a brief shoot-out with law enforcement ten months later. After this latter incident he spent 14 months, starting in April 1965, at Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison in eastern Ontario.\n\nSeventeen days after his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a shooting spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, that he had not been sane at the time of the incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.\n\nLamb continued to show improvement, becoming a productive labourer on Barker's farm and earning the trust of the doctor's family. With Barker's encouragement, Lamb joined the Rhodesian Army in late 1973 and fought for the unrecognised government of Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) for the rest of his life. He started his service in the Rhodesian Light Infantry, and won a place in the crack Special Air Service unit in 1975, but was granted a transfer back to his former regiment a year later. Soon after he was promoted to lance-corporal, Lamb was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men. He received what \"Newsweek\" called \"a hero's funeral\" in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, before his ashes were returned to Windsor and buried by his relatives.\n\nMathew Charles Lamb was born in Windsor, Ontario on 5 January 1948, the only child of a 15-year-old mother who abandoned him soon after birth. Raised by an assortment of grandparents, aunts and uncles, he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father, who died in the United States while Lamb was young. Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor, where his presence was resented by the step-grandfather Collins. According to interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours conducted by Lamb's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid-1960s, Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse, beating him and frequently calling him a \"little bastard\". The direction of this violence was not limited to Lamb himself, however; he often witnessed his step-grandfather and grandmother fighting while he was still a small boy.\n\nLamb started exhibiting violent traits of his own from an early age. Nosanchuk writes that the young boy lured his cousins into his bedroom, locked them in a closet and threatened them. On one occasion he followed through with these threats and beat one of his cousins so badly that medical attention was required at a local hospital. \"I remember once,\" said Greg Sweet, a childhood friend, \"when he was about seven years old, he held a knife to a smaller kid and made him eat dog faeces\". Lamb first attended Colbourne School in Tecumseh, where Collins later said he appeared to be normal. School staff agreed, later telling the \"Windsor Star\" that he rarely got into trouble, and was capable, but unable to concentrate for extended periods.\n\nStarting with Grade 8, when he was 13, Lamb went to St Jude's School in Windsor, where the other pupils found him to be distant and quiet. According to a fellow pupil, he spurned attempts by the other children to include him in their social circles. For example, Lamb once refused an invitation to a party, saying that he \"didn't like to dance.\" Developing a keen interest in weapons, Lamb began to carry a knife to school, which he had little hesitation in showing off. He also became fascinated with firearms; according to Sweet, he and Lamb \"always had guns, from the time [they] were about 12 years old\". Sweet later told the \"Windsor Star\" that police were not informed when, as a teenager, Lamb strolled down a residential street \"firing a shotgun at the houses of people he didn't like\". Sweet also said that around this time Lamb assembled a collection of bullets and wrote the names of various local policemen on them. Lamb's hobby even extended to crude bombs, which he taught himself to produce using parts of various weapons. When he accidentally detonated one of these concoctions during preparation his leg was sprayed with shrapnel.\n\nOn 10 February 1964, barely a month after he turned 16, Lamb confronted a physically imposing police sergeant outside the Windsor Arena and, in front of a large crowd of people, leapt upon the far larger man and repeatedly punched him in the face. According to journalist Bob Sutton's account in the \"Windsor Star\" (published three years later), Lamb did this \"for no apparent reason\". Lamb was convicted of assault under the Juvenile Delinquents Act and served six months at the House of Concord, a young offenders' unit near London, Ontario, run by the Salvation Army. Upon his release, Lamb was sent by his step-grandfather to live in East Windsor with his uncle, Earl Hesketh. With Hesketh's support, Lamb briefly attended Assumption College School, where apart from a dislike for learning Latin, he performed creditably. However, with no real motivation to study, the boy soon dropped out to look for work. He was unable to hold down a permanent job and drifted through a series of short-term engagements, none lasting more than three months.\n\nOn the evening of 24 December 1964, Lamb smashed the front window of Lakeview Marine and Equipment, a sporting goods store in Tecumseh, and stole three revolvers and a double-barrelled shotgun. Using one of the revolvers, he fired twice on a police constable and the shop's co-owner, missing both times. The officer returned several shots, leading Lamb to come forward with his hands raised. \"Don't shoot. I give up,\" he said. He then showed the constable where he had hidden the other two handguns and the shotgun. Lamb, who turned 17 during the trial, was tried and convicted as an adult for \"breaking, entering and theft ... [and] possession of a .22 calibre revolver, dangerous to public peace\". Motivated by a presentence investigation report characterising Lamb as exceptionally violent, Magistrate J. Arthur Hanrahan sentenced him to two years at Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison. According to Nosanchuk's account, the severity of the sentence was unusual for a first-time adult offender who had not caused anybody physical harm. Hanrahan, Nosanchuk writes, must have deemed Lamb beyond rehabilitation. The boy arrived at the penitentiary in April 1965.\nPsychiatric examinations and psychological tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature young man who was strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of \"an obvious mental breakdown\". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. \"I think this young man is developing a mental illness of hypomanic nature,\" he wrote in his report. In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related what the doctor described as \"elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility\".\n\nLamb attempted suicide several times and for years afterwards bore scars where he had tried to slit his wrists. According to Nosanchuk, by early March 1966 the prisoner's behaviour \"bordered on psychotic\". During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum, this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing. When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty. Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition, a mania of low intensity, and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month. Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb's condition was genuine or whether he was just putting on an act.\n\nLamb returned to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into recidivism. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, but at the same time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as \"borderline\" or \"marginal\". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.\n\nSeventeen days after his release from Kingston Penitentiary, on the evening of 25 June 1966, Lamb discovered a shotgun in his uncle's house. He took the weapon and left the house shortly before 22:00 Eastern Time, then walked a single block north along Ford Boulevard and hid behind a tree outside number 1872. Six young people—Edith Chaykoski, 20, her 22-year-old brother Kenneth, his wife and three friends, 21-year-old Andrew Woloch, Vincent Franco and Don Mulesa—were heading south from 1635 Ford Boulevard on their way to a bus stop on Tecumseh Road when they approached the tree behind which Lamb was hiding at about 22:15. Lamb suddenly stepped out in front of the strangers, pointed the shotgun at them and said \"Stop. Put up your hands!\" When Edith Chaykoski stepped forward, towards Lamb, he shot her in the abdomen. Woloch then moved and was hit in the stomach by a second shot, which also wounded Kenneth Chaykoski. Lamb then ran across the street to 1867 Ford Boulevard and fired on a girl whose silhouette he had spotted in a side doorway of the house; his target, 19-year-old Grace Dunlop, was injured. As law enforcement and medical assistance were summoned, Lamb strolled away and walked two blocks before knocking on a door, which he had seemingly chosen at random. Pointing the shotgun at the elderly lady who lived there, Ann Heaton, he threatened to kill her. When Heaton cried out to her husband Forrest to phone the police, Lamb fled, throwing the shotgun over the old couple's fence into a field. He returned to the Hesketh house and went to sleep.\n\nEdith Chaykoski died from her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the neighbourhood during the morning and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's and concluded that the 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.\n\nOn the morning of 27 June 1966, Lamb appeared without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was \"hyperactive and agitated\"; he was unable to sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.\n\nAfter dismissing a few more questions as \"unimportant\", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he \"needed a lawyer\". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb \"leaping from topic to topic\", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; he spoke in a casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said \"I don't remember.\" Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, \"I don't remember. Somewhere.\" When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.\n\nWhen the interview ended at 13:35, the doctor noted that he found Lamb's hour-long maintenance of this seemingly hypomanic behaviour \"remarkable\". Simulation on Lamb's part was unlikely, Yaworsky believed, and lack of memory credible. The doctor wrote in his report that Lamb had been \"suffering from a disease of the mind\" at the time of the shootings, which had caused him to be in a kind of dream world, outside of reality. Standing before the magistrate that same afternoon, Yaworsky testified that Lamb was mentally unsound and not fit to stand trial. The magistrate once again remanded Lamb, this time to custody at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre for a minimum of 30 days. Lamb was again examined on 29 June 1966, this time by James Dolan, the Clinical Director of Psychiatry at St Thomas Elgin General Hospital.\n\nLamb described the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He said that on 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. \"Next thing I knew,\" he continued, \"I was on the street.\" He told Dolan that he had seen people \"as if they were on television\". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying \"Put up your hands\". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and \"somehow\" shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that \"everything seemed unreal.\" He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking \"what the hell am I in here for\" and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.\n\nAfter 30 days, on 27 July, the staff at Penetanguishene still deemed him unfit to stand trial, but by 27 August 1966 his state had improved enough for the doctors to allow his return to custody at Windsor. The doctors reported that he could now face the court—they said that the young man was now able to understand what the proceedings against him meant, and capable of working alongside a legal advisor. Because Lamb could not afford legal counsel, Justice Saul Nosanchuk was assigned by a local legal aid plan to advise him in the upcoming trial. Nosanchuk says that Lamb had \"no hesitation\" in signing a paper authorising the justice to represent him.\n\nNosanchuk quickly resolved that the only way to win the case and prevent the teenager from being hanged was to explore the background and circumstances both of the incident and of Lamb himself with a view to a mental disorder defence. At their first interview together, Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a \"slightly built, almost frail, quiet and detached 18-year-old ... very boyish in appearance. He had an exceedingly polite demeanour. He was most appreciative and grateful that I had undertaken his defence.\" When Nosanchuk asked the boy about the events of 25 June, Lamb became hesitant, disjointed and confused in his conversation; \"he seemed to view these events as if he was not really involved in them,\" Nosanchuk recalled. Lamb said that although he did have a faint recollection of what had happened, he could not remember taking the shotgun, loading it or shooting anybody. He said that earlier during the afternoon on 25 June he had watched a film on television in which somebody had shot and killed several people, but did not make clear whether he had been re-enacting this. The lawyer then asked Lamb to discuss his personal background, childhood and family. The 18-year-old was very reluctant to do so and when he did, Nosanchuk says that the boy seemed emotionally detached from the relatives and events he described.\n\nLamb appeared to the justice to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was no doubt that he had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and there was no evidence of provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened \"in detail\". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he \"clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse\". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb \"suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality\", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.\n\nHowever, Nosanchuk was still not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a defendant found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting on the advice of a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him for the rest of his life.\n\nNosanchuk then considered whether or not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.\n\nAfter a brief preliminary hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly showed no signs of emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.\n\nThe prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne QC, began his case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that three hours after the shootings his nephew had told him that he \"must have done it\". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him following his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she called to her husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been fast asleep in bed.\n\nThe defence began to present its psychiatric evidence on the third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed \"poor broad\", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having \"giggled\" at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then \"felt fuzzy\" when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: \"It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out.\" The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate \"the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being\".\n\nIn his cross-examination of the two doctors, Duchesne cited the psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed that it was not beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.\n\nJohn Robinson, the governor of Essex County Jail, was then called by the defence. Robinson testified that during Lamb's time in the county jail, his conduct had been impeccable except for an incident five weeks before the trial, on 10 December 1966, when he had, for no apparent reason, gone on what Robinson called a \"rampage\". In an episode lasting three hours, the defendant had smashed over 100 windows, set fire to blankets and broken plumbing, causing cells to flood. \"I was amazed by what I saw,\" Robinson said. \"The pupils were dilated like someone who comes in heavy on narcotics—except their eyes appear sunk in and his were bulged out.\" George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary then told the court that Lamb lived in a fantasy dream world, which had existed in his mind since early childhood, and had been in a pre-psychotic state when released from jail on 8 June 1966. This, he said, had boiled over into an \"acute schizoid episode\" on the night of the shootings. In cross-examination, Scott was pressed as to why he had allowed Lamb's release from Kingston if this was the case; he replied that although the prison officers had been concerned about Lamb's mental state on his release, there had not been conclusive grounds to certify him insane at that time.\n\nThree more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene were then called by Nosanchuk. George Darby told the court that in his conversations with Lamb the defendant had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him in an interview that he treated all people \"like bugs\" except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: \"I hate everybody on the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug.\" Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.\n\nDuchesne now called on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd to counter the defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had suddenly abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane and said that he was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able to understand the nature of what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.\n\n\nNosanchuk gave his final statement to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury that every one of the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found not guilty by reason of insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened. Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing?\n\n\nIn response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a \"well-reasoned argument\", which the jury paid rapt attention to. Duchesne declared that the incident had been the cold, calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex-convict, released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti-social psychopath. The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne said that this was possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted should be enough to incur criminal responsibility, even taking the psychiatric evidence into account. Finding Lamb not guilty by reason of insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts.\n\nJustice Stark then reviewed the evidence and advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, it was up to them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be not guilty by reason of insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.\n\nAs had been made clear several times before and during the trial, Lamb's court victory did not make him a free man. He was escorted by police back to Penetanguishene and placed in the hospital's maximum security unit at Oak Ridge, where he was to remain indefinitely pending an order from the Ontario Executive Council.\n\nElliot Barker, the head of Oak Ridge's therapeutic division, had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial. The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of neuroleptic tranquillisation and electroconvulsive therapy, supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more of their time in each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. \"My original vision,\" he writes, \"was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. I thought we could evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community.\" Barker's \"Social Therapy Unit\" (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction. Joan Hollobon, the medical editor of the Toronto \"Globe and Mail\", volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge as if she were a patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were \"pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... [displaying] individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus.\"\n\nIn August 1968 the unit created a \"Total Encounter Capsule\", which was a windowless, soundproofed room, wide and long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat on the floor and a ceiling containing a one-way mirror. It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide \"a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions.\" Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with LSD-25. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.\n\nFollowing his arrival in January 1967, Lamb enthusiastically took part and thrived in Barker's new programmes, becoming, the Montreal \"Gazette\" writes, \"a model inmate\". He became widely respected by his fellow patients and was successfully nominated as the ward's \"patient therapist\". \"He was helpful to the other patients,\" Barker told the \"Globe and Mail\", \"and they looked up to him.\" Barker elaborated on this subject in an interview with the \"Windsor Star\", telling them that during 1972 Lamb had been \"one of the most respected therapists in the hospital\". Lamb started a newspaper at Oak Ridge, for which he wrote articles while also encouraging others to contribute. Barker and his colleagues were so impressed by the young man's progress that they began to take him to lectures at Ontario Police College in Aylmer, where they introduced him as evidence of rehabilitation's potential. After about five years at Oak Ridge, the matter of Lamb's liberty was taken up by a five-man Advisory Review Board made up of Ontario Supreme Court Justice Edson Haines, two independent psychiatrists unrelated to Lamb's case, a lawyer and a lay person. The advisory board's recommendation that Lamb be released was approved by the Ontario Executive Council in early 1973; the board gave him a clean bill of health and said he was no longer dangerous.\n\nThe conditions of Lamb's release were that he must spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200-acre (0.80 sq km; 0.31 sq mi) farm, under the doctor's observation. The former inmate proved to be an industrious labourer, helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm's best workers. Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three-year-old daughter, who became very attached to the young man. During his time living and working on the farm, Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry, including \"The Mask of Sanity\" by Hervey M. Cleckley, which affected him particularly. He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life. At the same time, he considered a career in the military, which Barker supported. \"He wanted that kind of life,\" Barker later told the \"Globe and Mail\". \"He really seemed to need the \"esprit de corps\" of an army organisation.\" When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973, starting the Yom Kippur War, Lamb thought he had found his calling—using money he had saved from his labourer's salary and gifts from his grandmother, he bought State of Israel Bonds and, with Barker's encouragement, travelled to Israel to volunteer for the Israel Defense Forces. However, after hitch-hiking to the Israeli lines, Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there, many of whom were loath to fight and wanted to go home. He applied anyway, but was turned down because of his psychiatric history. He resolved to instead tour the world, and to that end left Israel days after arriving, intending to travel to Australia.\n\nOn his way to Australia in October 1973, Lamb stopped off in South Africa and Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), where he cut his travels short to enlist in the Rhodesian Army. According to Barker, Lamb travelled to Africa with this intention all along. Rhodesia's unrecognised and predominantly white government was at that time fighting a war against communist-backed black nationalist guerrillas who were attempting to forcibly introduce majority rule. Like most of the foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian forces, Lamb mustered into the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), an all-white heliborne commando battalion engaged largely in counter-insurgency operations. He and the other foreign soldiers received the same pay and conditions of service as the Rhodesians they served alongside. \"In many respects the RLI was a mirror of the French Foreign Legion, in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man's past and asked no questions,\" writes Chris Cocks, a veteran of the unit, \"and like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man's past was irrelevant.\" So it proved for Lamb; keeping his past a secret, he became a highly regarded and popular member of 3 Commando, RLI, noted for his professionalism and physical fitness. \"The Rhodesians thought he was a first-class soldier,\" Barker later told the \"Globe and Mail\".\n\nLamb visited his aunt and uncle in Windsor on leave in May 1975, \"proudly wearing his uniform\", journalist Tony Wanless writes. Turned out in the RLI's tartan green ceremonial dress and green beret, he was conspicuous walking along Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. \"He had the uniform and looked a little different,\" Richard told the \"Windsor Star\" a year later, \"but I never forgot his face.\" Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused to leave the house alone. While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he \"didn't want it associated with his adopted country\". He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, he said, he felt great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service.\n\nLamb was deeply saddened by the bias he perceived the Western media to have against the Rhodesian government and army, but was reportedly conspicuous for leaping to the defence of any black Rhodesians he thought were receiving bad treatment. \"He sympathised with the blacks,\" Barker told the \"Windsor Star\", \"but believed that chaos would result if they took over immediately. He used to scrap with other soldiers who treated blacks badly. He was very bright and knew the blacks would eventually take over the country.\"\n\nSoon after his furlough to Canada, Lamb was transferred from the RLI to the elite Special Air Service (SAS) unit in September 1975. There he trained as a paratrooper and, after passing selection, found himself in a vastly different role to the one he had become used to during his time in the RLI. Rather than taking part in the RLI's fast and furious Fireforce counter-strike procedures, he found himself taking part in covert reconnaissance actions, \"acting as eyes and ears,\" as Barbara Cole writes. Wishing to see more action, Lamb requested a posting back to the RLI, which was granted; he rejoined 3 Commando. In late 1976, at the age of 28, he was promoted to lance-corporal and took command of a \"stick\" of four men from 12 Troop, 3 Commando on Fireforce duty on Operation \"Thrasher\", which covered Rhodesia's eastern highlands against guerrilla activity.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 7 November 1976, three insurgents from a group of seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man \"stops\" involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. \"They are going to get me this time,\" he yelled, sardonically; \"Just you watch, Phil Kaye!\" Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. \"Go nail gooks!\" Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.\n\nStop 2 landed, formed up into a sweep line and marched carefully to the north alongside a dry riverbed. As darkness fell, just as they came to a widening in the riverbed, they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe. All four men dropped to the ground to avoid being hit. The Canadian lance-corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and cautiously moved forward. A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers' line of sight, between Lamb and the riverbed, and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied, imprecise burst of fire. Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb stumbled, slumped to the ground and lay face-down in a heap. One of the bullets exited through the back of his body, smashing the radio he had been carrying. He died almost instantly. Meanwhile, the cadres ahead ran headlong into Stop 1, led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight. Taylor's stick sustained no casualties. When the battle was over, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at Chipinga. The death was officially recorded as \"killed in action\", with no reference to friendly fire.\n\nAs Lamb had predicted, his death provoked stories in the Canadian local and national media that strongly stressed his history of violence and insanity. It even caused a heated debate in the Canadian House of Commons over why, considering his personal history in Ontario and subsequent service in the armed forces of a country Canada did not recognise, Lamb had been issued a valid Canadian passport and allowed to renew it on 26 April 1976. The Chaykoski family received the news with some relief, Wanless reported in the \"Windsor Star\", having \"lived in terror\" since Lamb's release from Penetanguishene three years earlier.\n\nIn Rhodesia, by contrast, Lamb was posthumously held in very high regard by the men who had served alongside him. His photograph in full dress uniform was placed on 3 Commando's Wall of Honour and remained there until the RLI was disbanded in 1980. When the story of his earlier life in Canada was run by the \"Rhodesia Herald\", the paper received numerous strongly worded letters from soldiers who refused to believe it. They demanded a printed retraction and apology, which the \"Herald\" gave soon after to preempt any further scandal. The lance-corporal was given what the \"Windsor Star\" and \"Newsweek\" both described as a \"hero's funeral\" in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, on 15 November 1976. No members of his family were present. His coffin, draped in the Rhodesian flag and topped with a large bouquet of flowers, was carried on a gun carriage to Warren Hills Cemetery, on the western outskirts of the city, where soldiers of the RLI fired three volleys of shots and senior officers saluted as the coffin was carried to the crematorium on the shoulders of eight RLI men. Lamb's ashes were afterwards returned to his relatives in Windsor, Ontario, where they were buried alongside the remains of his grandmother.\n\n\n"}

The role was originated by Eddie Cibrian in May 1994, who left the show in 1996. After Russell Lawrence briefly playing the character in 2000, Rick Hearst took over the role that year, departing in 2001 after the character was killed off. Hearst returned for several appearances as an apparition. Matt was known as an antagonistic villain who created problems for Nick and Sharon Newman, beginning when they were teens in high school. He raped both Sharon Collins and Amy Wilson, and framed Nicholas Newman for multiple crimes.\n\nEddie Cibrian was hired to portray recurring character Matt Clark in May 1994. In October of that year, he signed a three-year contract with the series. Cibrian said that he believed the writers \"were going to turn the story into something bigger\" and wanted to keep it going. The character exited in 1996 after nearly three years. Russell Lawrence became the next actor in the role, portraying Matt in 2000. However, he was replaced a few months later with Rick Hearst who debuted in October 2000. Hearst was familiar with the soap opera genre, having played Alan-Michael Spaulding on \"Guiding Light\" for several years prior. \"TimesDaily\" wrote: \"Expect the storyline of the vengeful Matt to be stepped up with Hearst in the role\".\n\nIn April 2001, it was announced that Hearst would exit, and the character died onscreen the following month. However, due to Hearst's popularity with viewers, the actor returned for several recurring guest appearances beginning July 2001 as a vision being seen by the insane Tricia Dennison after his character's death. Speaking on his exit and appearances afterward, Hearst said: \"I look at every opportunity as a gift. When I was let go (...) and was brought back as a freaking apparition for six months, I looked at it as, they called me for work this week.\"\n\nMatt has been characterized by \"Soaps In Depth\" as the show's previous \"bad boy\", and a \"cocky jock-turned rapist\" by \"Star-News\". Cibrian called him \"horrific\", stating: \"I've never encountered anybody like him in my life. Nor would I ever want to.\" The character started out as a \"regular guy\" on the show, but after Cibrian became a regular cast member, he began doing \"awful things\" and became \"the bad guy\", beginning with raping Sharon Collins (Sharon Case). Cibrian found the role challenging and said: \"Unfortunately there are people in the world like Matt. That’s why they put this in the script, so people could be aware.\"\n\nAs a high school senior in 1994, Matt Clark dates Sharon Collins and develops a bitter rivalry with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) who ends up winning Sharon from him. A fight between Matt and Nick results in Nick being badly beaten. Shortly thereafter, Matt rapes Sharon, causing her to sink into a depression. Matt then dates Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris), Sharon's best friend. Reacting to Nick and Sharon becoming king and queen of their high school Polynesian dance, Matt exposes Sharon's secret: that she is not a virgin, and had given up a baby for adoption when she was 16. While Nick is briefly angry at Sharon, he forgives her and the pair become engaged. After Sharon confesses to Nick that Matt raped her, just prior to their planned wedding, Nick goes after Matt, but instead finds him lying in a pool of blood on his apartment floor, having been shot. Nick is arrested, while Matt survives and falsely claims that Nick shot him. After a trial, Nick is found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Nick's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) tracks down Amy in a mental institution, who has been suffering from PTSD. Amy reveals that she was the person who shot Matt after he raped her. Nick is acquitted and Matt leaves town in 1996.\n\nIn 2000, Matt Clark surfaces in town under the alias of Carter Mills, having had plastic surgery to change his appearance, and begins working at Nick and Sharon's coffeehouse. Carter uses Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet), a woman he slept with, to frame Nick for selling drugs. Sharon grows close with Carter while Nick is in jail. Carter nearly succeeds in raping Sharon by using a date rape drug, but Nick arrives home and his plans are thwarted. Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) begins searching for Matt Clark, realizing that he may have had plastic surgery. Carter later meets Sharon at a cabin in the woods and tries to rape her there, but is stopped when Victor arrives. Tricia drives off with Carter in her car but deliberately drives off a cliff in an attempt to kill them both. While Tricia survives the crash, Carter had fatal injuries. Carter pulls out his own breathing tube, killing himself, and framing Nick for his murder. Nick is implicated in Carter's murder, but is ultimately found not guilty.\n\nJust before Matt's death, he lied to Nick, telling him that he had raped Sharon. Sharon becomes pregnant, and Nick demands a paternity test, which she refuses (not wanting to harm the child). After a fight with Nick, Sharon runs after him and trips over a chair. The fall causes her to give birth prematurely to a stillborn baby. A paternity test confirmed that Nick was the father, not Matt.\n\nBoth Cibrian and Hearst became popular for their portrayals of Matt. In 1996, soap opera journalist Seli Groves of \"The Beaver County Times\" newspaper opined that it was likely for Matt to return one day, writing that \"characters with this sort of seething history are often recalled from soap limbo\". A message published in the newspaper by a viewer named Andrea P. described the character of Matt as \"a real rat\", but with the observation that Cibrian \"played it so well\". When Lawrence was cast in the role, Toby Goldstein of \"TimesDaily\" noted that Matt was \"likely to bring misery to Nick and Sharon's lives\". Global TV's Aaron Hagey-MacKay included the character's death on a list of the \"Top drunken, brutal, mysterious and volcanic deaths of Y&R\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" called Matt an \"evil rapist\", while Sara Bibel of Xfinity argued in 2009 that the character was written out due to being a rapist, stating that the soap opera was \"the one show with a zero tolerance for sexual assault\".\n\n"}

He was born into a herder's family in Dariganga, Sükhbaatar, Mongolia, in 1952. Mend-Ooyo lives in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and directs the Mongolian Academy of Culture and Poetry.\n\nMend-Ooyo is quoted saying: \"My life is the mirror of Mongolia. I grew up in the classic nomadic way of life, then moved to the city. But even after all these years I am not a city person. All my dreams are about the countryside, and I feel like I am living in a birdcage. Now I am planning to move back to the countryside. I just hope Mongolia will too.\"\n\nHe started his career in 1970, as an elementary school teacher in the border village of Zamiin Uud, Dornogovi aimag, in the far south east of Mongolia. For ten years, from 1978, he was the editor-in-chief for the arts and cultural programmes on Mongolian State radio and television, In 1988 he became a professional writer with the Mongolian Writer's Union.\n\nAfter the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia, Mend-Ooyo became the Chief Project Lead and driving force behind the reconstruction of the Migjid Janraisig complex at Gandantegchinlen Monastery in Ulaanbaatar. At that time he was also a member of the Mongolian National Committee of UNESCO, and, successively, executive director, vice-president and president of the Mongolian Cultural Foundation. From 1998-2000 he sat as Chairman of the governmental Culture and Arts Agency.\n\nIn 2002 he became Life member of the World Academy of Arts and Culture. In 2004 he joined the board of the Mongolian Art Council. In 2005 he founded the Mongolian culture, literature and poetry magazine \"GUNU\", for which he also acted as the editor-in-chief. In that same year he became president of the Mongolian Academy of Culture and Poetry. In 2006 he became the President of the 26th World Congress of Poets in Mongolia. He joined in fellow residency program in Civitella Ranieri Foundation in 2014, and also led the World Poetry Days in Mongolia in 2017.\n\nIn 1996, Mend-Ooyo earned a Master's degree at the University of Arts and Culture in Mongolia. In 2002, he was granted a Doctorate of Literature by the World Academy of Arts and Culture. In 2008, he became professor of Arts and Culture at the Institute of International Studies of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. In 2015, the University of Arts and Culture, Mongolia granted him Honorary doctor for his achievement in literature.\n\nMend-Ooyo started writing poems at the age of thirteen. In an interview for the WSJ he explains he became interested in writing, thanks in part to Dorjiin Gombojav. D.Gombojav was a controversial poet and translator who had alienated officials in Ulaanbaatar. He was sent, as punishment, to teach at the remote rural school Mend-Ooyo attended. Mend-Ooyo related to the interviewer that he wrote his first lines of poetry under D.Gombojav’s guidance. \"He taught me the importance of Mongolian language and our traditions,\" he says.\n\nIn the late 1970s, he was one of the founder members of the underground literary group GAL (\"Fire\"). Mend-Ooyo explained that at the time, communist censors wouldn’t let groups meet. \"They were always watching us, so we had to be very careful and meet in people's homes at night.\" The GAL group, active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, included mainly Mend-Ooyo, Ochirbatyn Dashbalbar and D.Nyamsüren. Though GAL was \"organised around the so-called Dariganga Three\", others were at times involved as well. According to Simon Wickham-Smith, they \"came to dominate the poetry scene during the subsequent ten or fifteen years, and their work is vital for a proper understanding of recent literary history in Mongolia.\"\n\nGAL transformed during the 1980s into an \"independent flow of literary writing called \"GUNU\"\", whose writers \"nowadays exercise(s) the greatest influence on Mongolian literature.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Mend-Ooyo was allowed to publish some of his poetry after it was vetted by officials. Later, in 1988, Mend-Ooyo became a member of the Mongolian Writers' Union.\n\nIn 1980, he published his first book of poetry, \"The Bird of Thought\". Many were to follow. After the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia and the end of single-party communist rule, he started to publish more of his work, \"including the writing that espoused his pastoral roots and eventually became his best-known poems.\" Since his first book, he has published over twenty other books of poetry, and over a dozen novels and children's books.\n\n\"Altan Ovoo\" (\"Golden Hill\") is an ongoing work of poetic fiction that has become one of the most influential pieces of contemporary Mongolian literature. First published in 1993, its fifth edition was published in 2010. \"Altan Ovoo\" has been translated into English by Simon Wickham-Smith in 2007. According to Wickham-Smith, Mend-Ooyo has referred to this book as his most important work. Mend-Ooyo constantly rearranges and edits \"the elements of the narrative, to such an extent that it seems sometimes to be more an experimental novel (à la B.S. Johnson perhaps) than a work by a romantic and deeply traditional Central Asian writer,\" explains Wickham-Smith.\n\n\"Altan Ovoo\" has been the focus of Simon Wickham-Smith's Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Washington. He explains that \"Mend-Ooyo's poetic novel \"Altan Ovoo\" offers a vision of nomadic literature based as much on the history and worldview of Mongol nomadic herders as on the late twentieth century Mongolia, poised between Soviet-influenced socialism and Euro-American democratic capitalism, in which it was written.\" In his dissertation, Wickham-Smith presents \"\"Altan Ovoo\" as a prism through which the ideas on which nomadic culture is based can be shown as being central to the self-image of Mongolia's people, both in relation to the past and to the future.\"\n\n\"Gegeenten\" (\"The Holy One\"), published in 2012, is a modern example of the traditional Mongolian genre of namtar, non-canonical biographies of Buddhist saints intended to be read by common people. Mend-Ooyo explains that \"Gegeenten\" tells the story of the Noton Hutagt Dulduityn Danzanravjaa. It tells \"of his realisation of, and how he expressed, the secret wisdom in the teaching and practise of the historical Buddha and his descendents.\" The story, according to the writer, \"also reveals how Danzanravjaa's life speaks to Mongol intellectual culture and the nomadic tradition of the Gobi area in which he lived, and how this tradition is an expression of the land and the environment in which he lived.\" According to Maria Petrova, \"Gegeenten\" \"can be called the first prose work, where the image of the great Gobi Noenkhutukhta (sic) and poet D.Ravzhi (sic) found artistic expression.\"\n\nIn addition to his poetry and his novels, Mend-Ooyo has also written over half a dozen research books, with topics ranging from Old Mongol script to poetry critiques, Dariganga folklore and consumer culture amongst the Mongolian nomads.\n\nMend-Ooyo's work has been translated into over thirty languages, including English, Japanese, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Dutch, German and French.\n\nMend-Ooyo writes his poetry by hand. He tried to write his poetry on the computer. He says of this experience: \"It was amazing how easy and peaceful it was to erase what I had written, to begin again, to change words and to rearrange them, and to adjust the rhythm of a poem. When I had finished my poem, I printed it out. I read it. The spirit with which I had been born was missing, there was no mental engagement in it.\" And: \"I understood that my manuscript was the soul of my poem, the source of its spiritual power. A writer's manuscript is the calligraphy which shows the unrepeatable beating of their heart, the pathway through their warm life.\"\n\nMend-Ooyo has been awarded many prizes from literary organizations around the world. Most notably, he has been named Distinguished cultural figure of Mongolia, by decree of the President of Mongolia in 1996; received the Award of the Mongolian Writers' Union in 1999; and was named Best Man of the Year 2001, and honoured as one of the nine most renowned people in Mongolia. In 2001, Mend-Ooyo was awarded the \"Altan Ud\" (\"Golden Feather\") award, Mongolia's Writer of the Year. In 2006, the year of the 800th Anniversary of Great Mongolian Empire, Mend-Ooyo was awarded the Anniversary medal by the President of Mongolia. In 2012, Mend-Ooyo once again received the \"Altan Ud\" award, for his book Gegeenten.\n\nHe received many international award and accolades, from China to England, Greece and Korea, India, Japan and the USA. In 2005, he received the Medallion of the President award of the World Academy of Arts and Culture \"for poetic excellence\". In that same year, he won First prize in the poetry contest of the XXV World Congress of Poets. 2006 saw him receiving a string of awards from Greece, Korean and India, in addition to the Golden Gavel Award of the World Academy of Arts and Culture, and the Golden Medal of the Literary Academy of World Peace. 2008 was also a rewarding year for Mend-Ooyo, with awards from the Crane Summit 21st Century International (Poetry) Forum and the Soka Gakkai University. In 2009, Mend-Ooyo was named Poet Laureate (with Golden Crown), the highest poetry award of the World Congress of Poets. In 2014, he was awarded the Grand Prize of the Mihai Eminescu International Festival in Craiova, Romania. In 2015 he received the Order of Chinggis Khaan, the highest honor of Mongolia, by the declaration of Mongolian President.\n\nMend-Ooyo has organized a number of poetry and cultural events in Mongolia. Most notably, he organized the XXVI World Congress of Poets in Mongolia, held in 2006.\n\nHe participated in many poetry events around the world, such as the 12th Festival of World Youth and Students, Moscow, Russia in 1985; the Asian-African Young Writers Forum, New Delhi in 1987; the World Bank Conference Cultural Heritage, Florence, Italy in 1999; the Japanese-Mongolian Forum, Tokyo in 1999; the International Poetry Festival, Tokyo, Japan in 2000; the 21st, 22nd, 25th, 28th and 29th World Congress of Poets in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009; the Crane Summit 21st Century International Poetry and Culture Forum, Taipei, Taiwan in 2005; the Asian Pan-Pacific X Poetry Conference, Tokyo in 2005; the Qinghai Lake International Poetry Festival, China in 2007; the Jan Smrek International Literary Festival, Bratislava, Slovakia in 2008; the Soka Gakka International Forum, Tokyo, Japan in 2008; the Struga International Poetry Evenings, Ohrid, Macedonia in 2009; the 1st International Pen Ural Altay Conference, Istanbul, Turkey in 2009; the 60th Anniversary of R.O.C Literature and Art Festival, Taipei, Taiwan in 2010; the 7th annual Stanford Pan-Asian Music Festival, San Francisco, USA in 2011; and the 3rd Ural Altaic PEN solidarity network Congress, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in 2011.\n\nIn 2014, Mend-Ooyo was artist in residence at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Umbria, Italy.\n\nWhile his fame is mainly based on his poetry, Mend-Ooyo has also found acclaim as a calligrapher, specialising in traditional Mongolian calligraphy. His work has been exhibited in Mongolia in the \"Poetry and Calligraphy\" exhibition in Ulaanbaatar in 2006; the 2007 \"Coming Time\" poetry and calligraphy exhibition in the Zanabazar Museum in Ulaanbaatar; the 2010 \"Crystal Temple of Mend-Ooyo’s soul\" poetry and calligraphy exhibition in the Mongolian Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar, opened by the Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj.\n\nIn 2011, the \"Дэлхий ээж\" (\"Delhii eej\": \"Earth Mother\", \"Mother Earth\", or \"World Mother\") poetry and calligraphy exhibition was held in the Mongolian Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar, in collaboration with another calligrapher, D.Battömör. Before setting out creating some sixty calligraphies, Battömör first read two of Mend-Ooyo's (\"All Shining Moments\" and \"A Patch of White Mist\") for inspiration. Together they choose the calligraphies they thought best expressed in calligraphic form Mend-Ooyo's verse. The poems were then written into the calligraphies in manuscript (as opposed to draw them with a brush). Afterwards, Battömör and Mend-Ooyo stamped their seals on these calligraphies. This exhibition traveled to Japan in 2012, where it showed at the Kyoritsu Women's University in Tokyo.\n\nIn 2012, Mend-Ooyo showed his calligraphy in \"The Steppe\" calligraphy exhibition at the Art House Center in Ulaanbaatar.\n\nAlso in 2012, fourteen of his calligraphy works, curated by S.Sumiya were exhibited in the Museum Café of the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands during a Mongolia Festival which was held against the backdrop of the museum exhibition \"Horse & Rider - From Homer to Genghis Khan\".\n\nIn 2014, Mend-Ooyo participated in the joint calligraphy exhibition \"Sky, Sun and Partnership\", held at the Blue Moon Art Gallery, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of Mongolian-Japanese cultural relations. The line-up of artists included public figures such as the Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, then Mongolian Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag and the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. The \"Sky, Sun, Partnership\" exhibition traveled to Japan in March, 2015. Mend-Ooyo opened the exhibition, which was held at the Itochu Aoyama Art Square. Some of the exhibited pieces were to be auctioned for charity, the proceeds donated to volunteer groups to support the recovery of the area affected by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake.\n\nA writer and poet, Mend-Ooyo is also on occasion a song writer. The lyrics to the song \"Delhii eej\" (\"Earth Mother\"), first put to music by R.Enhbazar in 1985, are well known in Mongolia. Other song lyrics of Mend-Ooyo's hand are \"Eejiin buuveitei horvoo\" (\"World with mother’s buuvei\"), music by R.Enhbazar, 1981; \"Enh ugluu\" (\"Peaceful morning\"), music by R.Enhbazar, 1982; \"Namriin ineemseglel\" (\"Smiles of autumn\"), music by R.Enhbazar, 1983; \"Malchin\" (\"Herdsmen\"), music by D.Battömör, 1985; \"Aduu molor erdene\" (\"Horse is treasure\"), music by N.Jantsannorov, 1992; \"Telmen huh zereglee\" (\"Blue miracle\"), music by N.Jantsannorov, 1995; \"Altan urgiin nutag\" (\"Pastures of golden blood\"), music by Hatanbaatar, 2004; and \"Orchlon delhiidee bid jargaltai\" (\"We are happy at our Earth\"), music by D.Tsogdelger.\n\nMend-Ooyo's writing deals with the life of Mongolia's nomadic herders, their culture and cultural knowledge. In his style and thematic material, he seeks to express the melody and richness of the Mongol language and nomadic society.\n\nMend-Ooyo explains his work in his short essay \"My Gentle Lyric\" - translated by S.Sumiya - thus: \"I have long been absorbed by the fundamental nature of my nomadic ancestors, believing in them, favouring and cherishing their quiet, gentle melody. The gentle melody is the nature of my poetry. The wheels of the wooden cart which turn without harming the grass, the quiet character of the elders who avoid stepping on the flowers, the trust of the nomads who have no locks on their doors... it seems that the short road to purity lies here.\"\n\nAs the poet Ruth O'Callaghan explains in her foreword to Mend-Ooyo's book of poetry \"A Patch of White Mist\" Mend-Oyoo's poetry is rooted in his Mongolian heritage. According to O'Callaghan, Mend-Ooyo \"engages us not only with a superb lyricism but also a profound philosophy\" based in Buddhism. Where most people would settle for a philosophy that fits easily and neatly in this modern world, Mend-Ooyo courageously \"continues on his quest to discover his own unique position [...] for his existence,\" in the process crossing impossible boundaries. Mend-Ooyo's philosophy - as he words it in his poetry - is fuelled by Buddhism. Meditation stokes in him a deep empathy with the whole of creation. This profound life-long involvement with Buddhism is the source of Mend-Ooyo's strength; a strength that \"an urgency to Mend-Ooyo's poetry in his chronicling of his pursuit of selfhood that is so lucidly and lyrically expressed.\"\n\nBorn into a herdsman's family in Dariganga, Sükhbaatar, Mongolia, in 1952, Mend-Ooyo grew up riding horses and tending sheep, moving over the steppe by camel caravan. Today, he leads a life very different from his childhood, moving across the world by air plane, his mobile phone constantly ringing and his office in Ulaanbaatar crowded by many Mongolian and foreign visitors. Yet, his heart remains faithful to the old ways of the steppe. Despite his achievements, Mend-Ooyo's is acutely aware that \"to leave behind one's heritage is to court disaster.\"\n\nO'Callaghan explains that Mend-Ooyo's poetry weaves a rich tapestry that will live long in the mind of the Western reader. Mend-Ooyo explores the intimate connection between \"the personal and the universal.\" He expresses himself with delicate perception and a gift for language. Western readers will be excited to find that Mend-Ooyo's poetry offers an \"informative, introductory insight into the Mongolian psyche – a psyche which embraces the topography not simply of Mongolia or even the universe but of the world beyond this world, an 'otherness' which travels with the poet as surely as his nomadic ancestors.\"\n\nSimon Wickham-Smith - translator and currently a lecturer at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA - in his foreword to Mend-Ooyo's children's book \"Quickwit The Camel\", explains Mend-Ooyo's philosophy as the expression of the \"profound relationship between Mongolians and the landscape of their country, its physical and historical contours, its spiritual and cultural traditions and, most importantly perhaps, its visionary pathways.\" He continues to explain that for Mongolians, their landscape is their ancestors. Especially in his book \"Golden Hill\" does Mend-Ooyo present - both in poetry and in prose - an admixture of dream, myth, cultural and social history, memoir, (auto)biography, and natural history.\n\nIn an interview Simon Wickham-Smith says: \"The idea of traditional Mongolian culture is paramount to Mend-Ooyo. He is trying to keep the nomadic spirit alive in spite of modernization\" He adds \"Mr. Mend-Ooyo is arguably the most important poet in Mongolia today, and certainly the one with the most presence, though some of the newer generation might say he is a bit stuck in the past.\"\n\nIn the same article for the WSJ, Bavuudorj Tsogdorj, 43 years old and an exponent of the younger generation of Mongolian poets, expresses his believe that \"his increasingly urbanized countrymen will eventually appreciate their nomadic tradition.\" He continues: \"Younger poets are now writing with European thoughts and styles, but they will come back to Mongolian poetry and thoughts someday. At that time Mend-Ooyo will be really valuable.\" He adds: \"Mend-Ooyo is Mongolia’s poetry representative — he is a genuine nomadic poet.\"\n\nToday, Mend-Ooyo puts his energy into rethinking the modern Mongolian way of life. In an interview he explains that \"he envisions a 21st-century nomadic community in which schools, health care and markets move with the people, allowing them to maintain their mobility while providing some of the benefits of contemporary society.\" As he says it: \"It's my dream to build it.\" And: \"The reason nomads come to the cities is to get education for their children, hospital access. We want to allow nomads to be more modern, to use cellphones and Internet. Keep the old life, just make it better.\"\n\n“\"Mend-Ooyo is an artist, full of good deeds, spreading the best of Mongolian culture and customs to the public nationally and internationally as his fame echoes not only across Mongolia but also beyond our borders.\"” <br>“\"Gombojav dispune de darul meditaţiei versulsău stậrneşte cititorul, il pune pe ganduri, transmitandu-i propriile trairi passionale, intr-o comuniune intima cu elementele primordial ale naturii, cu insasi viata, intr-un registru lucid, calm, dar profubd emotional.\"” <br>“\"It is a poetry that starts from a concrete fact and transforms into a timeless art. The elements that compose it stop having a date, lose their significance and become symbols that recover the imagination as a temperature and fruity sensation of life, forging itself with its most intense expression. It is time without intermediaries through which we arrive at the presence of the unknown, to the true mystery of poetry where the end resembles the beginning. This present never happens in a linear time even if it seems so. It opens a path in space, makes the immensity navigable. That is why I love the meaning of his verbal prayer, that hidden power he has of returning to the everyday, to the rumor of his words, to that innocent smile of his poetic voice where everything remains insinuated, confessed, said.\"” <br>“\"\"The Holy One\" (Gegeenten) is a most impressive and skilfully-written literary novel, free from any petty constraints, and as close to a true account as we have had during the last hundred years of culture and history. In today's world we have the freedom to write pieces which show how wisdom and behavior are connected, such as an elite writer like Mend-Oyoo does by examining and revealing the facts and scholarship, and by unpacking the rumors and the history, and this most striking of works has indeed reached such a level.”\"<br>“\"More than any other extended piece of contemporary Mongolian literature, G Mend-Ooyo’s Altan Ovoo (Golden Hill) expresses the profound relationship between Mongolians and the landscape of their country, its physical and historical contours, its spiritual and cultural traditions and, most importantly perhaps, its visionary pathways. For Mongolians, their landscape is their ancestors, and Altan Ovoo (Golden Hill) presents in poetry and prose an admixture of dream, myth, history (cultural and social), memoir, auto/biography, and natural history.\"\n\n“\"In his new book, The Crystal Temple of Meaning, G Mend-Ooyo, a poet of peace and spirituality, brings to a level of mental stillness whomever enters this temple, pure and elegant as crystal, and singing with thought. His intention is to compare this volume of poems with a bright and calming temple…\"”<br>“\"G Mend-Ooyo’s work, the basis of his poetry, is simple: it is, as the name of his book suggests, that Nomads are Coming from the Horizon. The point where Heaven and Earth meet, the mutual worship of nature and human beings, intuition and the gently melody of the inner mind – this is the Golden Hill of his wisdom, in all that he writes there is the poetry of nomads and the memory of nomadism. Mend-Ooyo’s poetic œuvre is the essence and mentality of the Mongol nomad, it is the call of Heaven, its writing is the sweet melody of the Mongol vertical script, and its magic waves of poetry are valued throughout the world.\"”<br>“\"When I finished reading this book of poetry, G Mend-Ooyo’s In Timeless Light, I recalled something said by Martin Heidegger in his book Holzwege. He wrote, “In this time of confusion, how heavy is the poet’s burden! And when I read the first poem in this book, “Connective Meaning,” I had the thought that Mend-Oyoo has found indeed what the poet might in fact be able to do in our current time of confusion. So the poet and his poetic works are clearly revealing the inner world of human qualities. The poetry leads us back to the source. And thus we consider clearly the difference between intention and reality. It for sure is this poet’s bright and undying world which is manifest in us.”\"<br>“\"G Mend-Ooyo’s poetry has developed through his investigation of viewpoint and is able to express life through the simplicity of his language. And so the particular attitude of nomadic poetry is brought closer to the world stage. In other words, through his poetic work, which is the contemplation and worship of that meaning which reveals what is secret and which grants perspective, the special characteristics of oriental poetry are revealed.\"”<br>“\"G Mend Ooyo, is a superb writer, essentially is a poet who inscribes his lyric in both, poets and prose. His book entitled “Altan Ovoo (Golden Hill)” is a master piece which transports the readers into the steppes, people, history, and mystery of Mongolia.

I think they would sound beautiful.\"”<br>“\"In particular, his work Altan Ovoo is a sincere, transparent poem of the true nomads and a magical poetic work expressing the aspiration for the safeguard of the natural essence and spiritual immunity of humankind and of the Mongols, who are being polluted and drowned in the urbanized social civilization...\"”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "173612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173612", "title": "Octavia E. Butler", "text": "Octavia E. Butler\n\nOctavia Estelle Butler (June 22, 1947February 24, 2006) was an African-American science-fiction writer. A multiple recipient of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, she became in 1995 the first science-fiction writer to receive a MacArthur Fellowship.\n\nButler was born in Pasadena, California. After her father died, she was raised by her widowed mother. Extremely shy as a child, Octavia found an outlet at the library reading fantasy, and in writing. As a teen she began writing science fiction. She attended community college during the Black Power movement, and while participating in a local writer's workshop was encouraged to attend the Clarion Workshop, which focused on science fiction. \n\nShe soon sold her first stories and by the late 1970s had become sufficiently successful as an author that she was able to pursue writing full-time. Her books and short stories drew the favorable attention of the public and awards judges. She also taught writer's workshops, and eventually relocated to Washington. Butler died of a stroke at the age of 58. Her papers are held in the research collection of the Huntington Library.\n\nOctavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, California, the only child of Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshine man. Butler's father died when she was seven. Octavia was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother in what she would later recall as a strict Baptist environment.\n\nGrowing up in the racially integrated community of Pasadena allowed Butler to experience cultural and ethnic diversity in the midst of racial segregation. She accompanied her mother to her cleaning work, where the two entered white people's houses through back doors, as workers. Her mother was treated poorly by her employers.\n\nFrom an early age, an almost paralyzing shyness made it difficult for Butler to socialize with other children. Her awkwardness, paired with a slight dyslexia that made schoolwork a torment, led her to believe that she was \"ugly and stupid, clumsy, and socially hopeless\", becoming an easy target for bullies. As a result, she frequently passed the time reading at the Pasadena Central Library. She also wrote reams of pages in her \"big pink notebook\". Hooked at first on fairy tales and horse stories, she quickly became interested in science fiction magazines, such as \"Amazing Stories\", \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" and \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\". She began reading stories by John Brunner, Zenna Henderson, and Theodore Sturgeon.\nAt the age of 10, she begged her mother to buy her a Remington typewriter, on which she \"pecked [her] stories two fingered\". At 12, she watched the televised version of the film \"Devil Girl from Mars\" (1954) and concluded that she could write a better story. She drafted what would later become the basis for her Patternist novels. Happily ignorant of the obstacles that a black female writer could encounter, she became unsure of herself for the first time at the age of 13, when her well-intentioned aunt Hazel said: \"Honey ... Negroes can't be writers.\" But Butler persevered in her desire to publish a story, even asking her junior high school science teacher, Mr. Pfaff, to type the first manuscript she submitted to a science fiction magazine.\n\nAfter graduating from John Muir High School in 1965, Butler worked during the day and attended Pasadena City College (PCC) at night. As a freshman at PCC, she won a college-wide short-story contest, earning her first income ($15) as a writer. She also got the \"germ of the idea\" for what would become her novel \"Kindred\". An African-American classmate involved in the Black Power Movement loudly criticized previous generations of African Americans for being subservient to whites. As Butler explained in later interviews, the young man's remarks were a catalyst leading her to respond with a story providing historical context for the subservience, showing that it could be understood as silent but courageous survival. In 1968, Butler graduated from PCC with an associate of arts degree with a focus in History.\n\nAlthough Butler's mother wanted her to become a secretary in order to have a steady income, Butler continued to work at a series of temporary jobs. She preferred less demanding work that would allow her to get up at two or three in the morning to write. Success continued to elude her. She styled her stories after the white-and-male-dominated science fiction she had grown up reading. She enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, but switched to taking writing courses through UCLA Extension.\n\nDuring the Open Door Workshop of the Screenwriters' Guild of America, West, a program designed to mentor minority writers, her writing impressed one of the teachers, noted science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison. He encouraged her to attend the six-week Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop in Clarion, Pennsylvania. There, Butler met the writer Samuel R. Delany, who developed as a longtime friend. She also sold her first stories: \"Childfinder\" to Ellison, for his anthology \"The Last Dangerous Visions\" (still unpublished), and \"Crossover\" to Robin Scott Wilson, the director of Clarion, who published it in the 1971 Clarion anthology.\n\nFor the next five years, Butler worked on the series of novels that later become known as the Patternist series: \"Patternmaster\" (1976), \"Mind of My Mind\" (1977), and \"Survivor\" (1978). In 1978, she was finally able to stop working at temporary jobs and live on her writing. She took a break from the Patternist series to research and write \"Kindred\" (1979), and then finished the series with \"Wild Seed\" (1980) and \"Clay's Ark\" (1984).\n\nButler's rise to prominence began in 1984 when \"Speech Sounds\" won the Hugo Award for Short Story and, a year later, \"Bloodchild\" won the Hugo Award, the Locus Award, and the \"Science Fiction Chronicle\" Reader Award for Best Novelette. In the meantime, Butler traveled to the Amazon rainforest and the Andes to do research for what would become the \"Xenogenesis\" trilogy: \"Dawn\" (1987), \"Adulthood Rites\" (1988), and \"Imago \"(1989). These stories were republished in 2000 as the collection \"Lilith's Brood.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Butler worked on the novels that solidified her fame as a writer: \"Parable of the Sower\" (1993) and \"Parable of the Talents\" (1998). In 1995, she became the first science-fiction writer to be awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation fellowship, an award that came with a prize of $295,000.\n\nIn 1999, after her mother's death, Butler moved to Lake Forest Park, Washington. \"The Parable of the Talents\" had won the Science Fiction Writers of America's Nebula Award for Best Science Novel and she had plans for four more Parable novels: \"Parable of the Trickster\", \"Parable of the Teacher\", \"Parable of Chaos\", and \"Parable of Clay\". However, after several failed attempts to begin \"The Parable of the Trickster\", she decided to stop work in the series. In later interviews, Butler explained that the research and writing of the Parable novels had overwhelmed and depressed her, so she had shifted to composing something \"lightweight\" and \"fun\" instead. This became her last book, the science-fiction vampire novel \"Fledgling\" (2005).\n\nButler's first work published was \"Crossover\" in the 1971 Clarion Workshop anthology. She also sold the short story \"Childfinder\" to Harlan Ellison for the anthology \"The Last Dangerous Visions\". \"I thought I was on my way as a writer\", Butler recalled in her short fiction collection \"Bloodchild and Other Stories\". \"In fact, I had five more years of rejection slips and horrible little jobs ahead of me before I sold another word.\"\nStarting in 1974, Butler worked on a series of novels that would later be collected as the Patternist series, which depicts the transformation of humanity into three genetic groups: the dominant Patternists, humans who have been bred with heightened telepathic powers and are bound to the Patternmaster via a psionic chain; their enemies the Clayarks, disease-mutated animal-like superhumans; and the Mutes, ordinary humans bonded to the Patternists.\nThe first novel, \"Patternmaster\" (1976), eventually became the last installment in the series' internal chronology. Set in the distant future, it tells of the coming-of-age of Teray, a young Patternist who fights for position within Patternist society and eventually for the role of Patternmaster.\nNext came \"Mind of My Mind\" (1977), a prequel to \"Patternmaster\" set in the 20th century. The story follows the development of Mary, the creator of the psionic chain and the first Patternmaster to bind all Patternists, and her inevitable struggle for power with her father Doro, a parapsychological vampire who seeks to retain control over the psionic children he has bred over the centuries.\nThe third book of the series, \"Survivor\", was published in 1978. The titular survivor is Alanna, the adopted child of the Missionaries, fundamentalist Christians who have traveled to another planet to escape Patternist control and Clayark infection. Captured by a local tribe called the Tehkohn, Alanna learns their language and adopts their customs, knowledge which she then uses to help the Missionaries avoid bondage and assimilation into a rival tribe that opposes the Tehkohn.\n\nAfter \"Survivor\", Butler took a break from the Patternist series to write what would become her best-selling novel, \"Kindred\" (1979) as well as the short story \"Near of Kin\" (1979). In \"Kindred\", Dana, an African-American woman, is transported from 1976 Los Angeles to early 19th-century Maryland. She meets her ancestors: Rufus, a white slave holder, and Alice, a black freewoman forced into slavery later in life. In \"Near of Kin\" the protagonist discovers a taboo relationship in her family as she goes through her mother's things after her death.\n\nIn 1980, Butler published the fourth book of the Patternist series, \"Wild Seed\", whose narrative became the series' origin story. Set in Africa and America during the 17th century, \"Wild Seed\" traces the struggle between the four-thousand-year-old parapsychological vampire Doro and his \"wild\" child and bride, the three-hundred-year-old shapeshifter and healer Anyanwu. Doro, who has bred psionic children for centuries, deceives Anyanwu into becoming one of his breeders, but she eventually escapes and uses her gifts to create communities that rival Doro's. When Doro finally tracks her down, Anyanwu, tired by decades of escaping or fighting Doro, decides to commit suicide, forcing him to admit his need for her.\n\nIn 1983, Butler published \"Speech Sounds\", a story set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles where a pandemic has caused most humans to lose their ability to read, speak, or write. For many, this impairment is accompanied by uncontrollable feelings of jealousy, resentment, and rage. \"Speech Sounds\" received the 1984 Hugo Award for Best Short Story.\n\nIn 1984, Butler released the last book of the Patternmaster series, \"Clay's Ark\". Set in the Mojave Desert, it focuses on a colony of humans infected by an extraterrestrial microorganism brought to Earth by the one surviving astronaut of the spaceship Clay's Ark. As the microorganism compels them to spread it, they kidnap ordinary people to infect them and, in the case of women, give birth to the mutant, sphinx-like children who will be the first members of the Clayark race.\n\nButler followed \"Clay's Ark\" with the critically acclaimed short story \"Bloodchild\" (1984). Set on an alien planet, it depicts the complex relationship between human refugees and the insect-like aliens who keep them in a preserve to protect them, but also to use them as hosts for breeding their young. Sometimes called Butler's \"pregnant man story\", \"Bloodchild\" won the Nebula, Hugo, and Locus Awards, and the Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award.\n\nThree years later, Butler published \"Dawn\", the first installment of what would become known as the Xenogenesis trilogy. The series examines the theme of alienation by creating situations in which humans are forced to coexist with other species to survive and extends Butler's recurring exploration of genetically-altered, hybrid individuals and communities. In \"Dawn\", protagonist Lilith Iyapo finds herself in a spaceship after surviving a nuclear apocalypse that destroys Earth. Saved by the Oankali aliens, the human survivors must combine their DNA with an ooloi, the Oankali's third sex, in order to create a new race that eliminates a self-destructive flaw in humans—their aggressive hierarchical tendencies. Butler followed Dawn with \"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\" (1987), a story about how certain female sufferers of \"Duryea-Gode Disease\", a genetic disorder which causes dissociative states, obsessive self-mutilation, and violent psychosis, are able to control others afflicted with the disease.\n\n\"Adulthood Rites\" (1988) and \"Imago\" (1989) the second and the third books in the Xenogenesis trilogy, focus on the predatory and prideful tendencies that affect human evolution, as humans now revolt against Lilith's Oankali-engineered progeny. Set thirty years after humanity's return to Earth, \"Adulthood Rites\" centers on the kidnapping of Lilith's part-human, part alien child, Akin, by a human-only group who are against the Oankali. Akin learns about both aspects of his identity through his life with the humans as well as the Akjai. The Oankali-only group becomes their mediator, and ultimately creates a human-only colony in Mars. In \"Imago\", the Oankali create a third species more powerful than themselves: the shape-shifting healer Jodahs, a human-Oankali ooloi who must find suitable human male and female mates to survive its metamorphosis and finds them in the most unexpected of places, in a village of renegade humans.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Butler published two novels later designated as the Parable (or Earthseed) series. The books depict the struggle of the Earthseed community to survive the socioeconomic and political collapse of 21st-century America due to poor environmental stewardship, corporate greed, and the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor. The books propose alternate philosophical views and religious interventions as solutions to such dilemmas.\n\nThe first book in the series, \"Parable of the Sower\" (1993), features a fifteen-year-old protagonist named Lauren Oya Olamina, and is set in a dystopian California in the 2020s. Lauren, who suffers from a syndrome causing her to literally feel any physical pain she witnesses, decides to escape the corruption and corporatization of her community of Robledo. She forms a new belief system, Earthseed, in order to prepare for the future of the human race on another planet. Recruiting members of varying social backgrounds, Lauren relocates her new group to Northern California, naming her new community \"Earthseed\".\n\nHer 1998 follow-up novel, \"Parable of the Talents\", is set sometime after Lauren's death and is told through the excerpts of Lauren's journals as framed by the commentary of her estranged daughter, Larkin. It details the takeover of Earthseed by right-wing fundamentalist Christians, Lauren's attempts to survive their religious \"re-education\", and the final triumph of Earthseed as a community and a doctrine.\n\nIn between her Earthseed novels, Butler published the collection \"Bloodchild and Other Stories\" (1995), which includes the short stories \"Bloodchild\", \"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\", \"Near of Kin\", \"Speech Sounds\", and \"Crossover\", as well as the non-fiction pieces \"Positive Obsession\" and \"\"Furor Scribendi\".\n\nAfter several years of writer's block, Butler published the short stories \"Amnesty\" (2003) and \"The Book of Martha\" (2003), and her second standalone novel, \"Fledgling\" (2005). Both short stories focus on how impossible conditions force an ordinary woman to make a distressing choice. In \"Amnesty\", an alien abductee recounts her painful abuse at the hand of the unwitting aliens, and upon her release, by humans, and explains why she chose to work as a translator for the aliens now that the Earth's economy is in a deep depression. In \"The Book of Martha\", God asks a middle-aged African-American novelist to make one important change to fix humanity's destructive ways. Martha's choice—to make humans have vivid and satisfying dreams—means that she will no longer be able to do what she loves, writing fiction. These two stories were added to the 2005 edition of \"Bloodchild and Other Stories\".\n\nButler's last publication during her lifetime was \"Fledgling\", a novel exploring the culture of a vampire community living in mutualistic symbiosis with humans. Set on the West Coast, it tells of the coming-of-age of a young female hybrid vampire whose species is called Ina. The only survivor of a vicious attack on her families that left her an amnesiac, she must seek justice for her dead, build a new family, and relearn how to be Ina.\n\nDuring her last years, Butler struggled with writer's block and depression, partly caused by the side effects of medication for high blood pressure. She continued writing and taught at Clarion's Science Fiction Writers' Workshop regularly. In 2005, she was inducted into Chicago State University's International Black Writers Hall of Fame.\n\nButler died outside of her home in Lake Forest Park, Washington, on February 24, 2006 at the age of 58. Contemporary news accounts were inconsistent as to the cause of her death, with some reporting that she suffered a fatal stroke, while others indicated that she died of head injuries after falling and striking her head on her walkway. Another suggestion, backed by \"Locus\" magazine, is that a stroke caused the fall and hence the head injuries.\n\nButler maintained a longstanding relationship with the Huntington Library and bequeathed her papers including manuscripts, correspondence, school papers, notebooks, and photographs to the library in her will. The collection, comprising 39 cartons and eight file-cabinet drawers of material, was made available to scholars and researchers in 2010.\n\nIn multiple interviews and essays, Butler explained her view of humanity as inherently flawed by an innate tendency towards hierarchical thinking which leads to intolerance, violence and, if not checked, the ultimate destruction of our species.\n\n\"Simple peck-order bullying\", she wrote in her essay \"A World without Racism\", \"is only the beginning of the kind of hierarchical behavior that can lead to racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, classism, and all the other 'isms' that cause so much suffering in the world.\" Her stories, then, often replay humanity's domination of the weak by the strong as a type of parasitism. These \"others\", whether aliens, vampires, superhuman, or a slave masters, find themselves defied by a protagonist who embodies difference, diversity, and change, so that, as John R. Pfeiffer notes \"[i]n one sense [Butler's] fables are trials of solutions to the self-destructive condition in which she finds mankind.\"\n\nIn his essay on the sociobiological backgrounds of Butler's \"Xenogenesis\" trilogy, J. Adam Johns describes how Butler's narratives counteract the death drive behind the hierarchical impulse with an innate love of life (biophilia), particularly different, strange life. Specifically, Butler's stories feature gene manipulation, interbreeding, miscegenation, symbiosis, mutation, alien contact, non-consensual sex, contamination, and other forms of hybridity as the means to correct the sociobiological causes of hierarchical violence. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, \"[i]n [Butler's] narratives the undoing of the human body is both literal and metaphorical, for it signifies the profound changes necessary to shape a world not organized by hierarchical violence.\" The evolutionary maturity achieved by the bioengineered hybrid protagonist at the end of the story, then, signals the possible evolution of the dominant community in terms of tolerance, acceptance of diversity, and a desire to wield power responsibly.\n\nButler's protagonists are disenfranchised individuals who endure, compromise, and embrace radical change in order to survive. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, her stories focus on minority characters whose historical background makes them already intimate with brutal violation and exploitation, and therefore the need to compromise to survive. Even when endowed with extra abilities, these characters are forced to experience unprecedented physical, mental, and emotional distress and exclusion to ensure a minimal degree of agency and to prevent humanity from achieving self-destruction. In many stories, their acts of courage become acts of understanding, and in some cases, love, as they reach a crucial compromise with those in power. Ultimately, Butler's focus on disenfranchised characters serves to illustrate both the historical exploitation of minorities and how the resolve of one such exploited individual may bring on critical change.\n\nButler's stories feature mixed communities founded by African protagonists and populated by diverse, if similar-minded individuals. Members may be humans of African, European, or Asian descent, extraterrestrial (such as the N'Tlic in \"Bloodchild\"), from a different species (such as the vampiric Ina in \"Fledgling\"), and cross-species (such as the human-Oankali Akin and Jodahs in the \"Xenogenesis trilogy\"). In some stories, the community's hybridity results in a flexible view of sexuality and gender (for instance, the polyamorous extended families in \"Fledgling\"). Thus, Butler creates bonds between groups that are generally considered to be separate and unrelated, and suggests hybridity as \"the potential root of good family and blessed community life\".\n\nButler's work has been associated with the genre of Afrofuturism, a term coined by Mark Dery to describe \"speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture\". Some critics, however, have noted that while Butler's protagonists are of African descent, the communities they create are multi-ethnic and, sometimes, multi-species. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai explain in their 2010 memorial to Butler, while Butler does offer \"an afro-centric sensibility at the core of narratives\", her \"insistence on hybridity beyond the point of discomfort\" exceeds the tenets of both black cultural nationalism and of \"white-dominated\" liberal pluralism.\n\nMost critics praise Butler for her unflinching exposition of human flaws, which she depicts with striking realism. \"The New York Times\" regarded her novels as \"evocative\" and \"often troubling\" explorations of \"far-reaching issues of race, sex, power\". \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" called her examination of humanity \"clear-headed and brutally unsentimental\" and \"Village Voice\"s Dorothy Allison described her as \"writing the most detailed social criticism\" where \"the hard edge of cruelty, violence, and domination is described in stark detail\". \"Locus\" regarded her as \"one of those authors who pay serious attention to the way human beings actually work together and against each other, and she does so with extraordinary plausibility\". The \"Houston Post\" ranked her \"among the best SF writers, blessed with a mind capable of conceiving complicated futuristic situations that shed considerable light on our current affairs\".\n\nScholars, on the other hand, focus on Butler's choice to write from the point of view of marginal characters and communities and thus \"expanded SF to reflect the experiences and expertise of the disenfranchised\". While surveying Butler's novels, critic Burton Raffel noted how race and gender influence her writing: \"I do not think any of these eight books could have been written by a man, as they most emphatically were not, nor, with the single exception of her first book, \"Pattern-Master\" (1976), are likely to have been written, as they most emphatically were, by anyone but an African American.\" Robert Crossley commended how Butler's \"feminist aesthetic\" works to expose sexual, racial, and cultural chauvinisms because it is \"enriched by a historical consciousness that shapes the depiction of enslavement both in the real past and in imaginary pasts and futures\".\n\nButler has been praised widely for her spare yet vivid style, with \"Washington Post Book World\" calling her craftsmanship \"superb\". Burton Raffel regards her prose as \"carefully, expertly crafted\" and \"crystalline, at its best, sensuous, sensitive, exact not in the least directed at calling attention to itself\".\n\nIn interviews with Charles Rowell and Randall Kenan, Butler credited the struggles of her working-class mother as an important influence on her writing. Because Butler's mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was given the opportunity to learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books. She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her hard at work on a story, casually remarked that maybe one day she could become a writer, causing Butler to realize that it was possible to make a living as an author. A decade later, Mrs. Butler would pay more than a month's rent to have an agent review her daughter's work. She also provided Butler with the money she had been saving for dental work to pay for Butler's scholarship so she could attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, where Butler sold her first two stories.\n\nA second person to play an influential role in Butler's work was American writer Harlan Ellison. As a teacher at the Open Door Workshop of the Screen Writers Guild of America, he gave Butler her first honest and constructive criticism on her writing after years of lukewarm responses from composition teachers and baffling rejections from publishers. Impressed by her work, Ellison suggested she attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, and even contributed $100 towards her application fee. As the years passed, Ellison's mentorship became a close friendship.\n\nButler began reading science fiction at a young age, but quickly became disenchanted by the genre's unimaginative portrayal of ethnicity and class as well as by its lack of noteworthy female protagonists. She then set to correct those gaps by, as De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai point out, \"choosing to write self-consciously as an African-American woman marked by a particular history\"—what Butler termed as \"writing myself in\". Butler's stories, therefore, are usually written from the perspective of a marginalized black woman whose difference from the dominant agents increases her potential for reconfiguring the future of her society.\n\nPublishers and critics have labelled Butler's work as science fiction. While Butler enjoyed the genre deeply, calling it \"potentially the freest genre in existence\", she resisted being branded a genre writer. Her narratives have drawn attention of people from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds. She claimed to have three loyal audiences: black readers, science-fiction fans, and feminists.\n\nCharlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 soon after the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The highlights are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, \"What then is central to what you want to say about race?\" Butler's response was, \"\"Do\" I want to say something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?\" This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.\n\nIn an interview by Randall Kenan, Butler discusses how her life experiences as a child shaped most of her thinking. As a writer, she was able to use her writing as a vehicle to critique history under the lenses of feminism. In the interview, she discusses the research that had to be done in order to write her bestselling novel, \"Kindred\". Most of it is based on visiting libraries as well as historic landmarks with respect to what she is investigating. Butler admits that she writes science fiction because she does not want her work to be labeled or used as a marketing tool. She wants the readers to be genuinely interested in her work and the story she provides, but at the same time she fears that people will not read her work because of the \"science fiction\" label that they have.\n\nIn an interview with Joshunda Sanders, Butler commented on the space race and its influence on her work. She noted, \"I think of the space race as a way of having a nuclear war without having one.\" She claimed that Ronald Reagan believed a nuclear war against the Soviet Union was winnable. Butler admitted to being very confused by this idea, and said that it contributed to her idea for the Xenogenesis books. She said \"there must be something basic, something really genetically wrong with us if we're falling for this stuff.\" Butler then commented on how she felt a real fear about nuclear war during the Cold War and that these ideas had a real influence on some of her early works.\n\nIn an interview with Marilyn Mehaffy and AnaLouise Keating, for MELUS, Octavia Butler talked about how biology is used to keep groups of people out of power. She said, \"[w]hat's made of biology is that the people who are in power are going to figure out why this is a good reason for them to stay in power. Look at the tests that show that women have better linguistic abilities: Yet, how many of our ambassadors are women? How many of the politicians are women? This is not looked at; instead, the argument goes that women don't have the mathematical abilities ... every now and then. So we're much more likely now to be penalized for whatever we're assumed not to have. We're much more likely to find that whatever little genetic thing that's discovered is going to be used against us.\" The issue of biology defining women and what they can and can't do has long been a part of feminism.\n\n\"Parable of the Sower\" was adapted as \"Parable of the Sower: The Concert Version\", a work-in-progress opera written by American folk/blues musician Toshi Reagon in collaboration with her mother, singer and composer Bernice Johnson Reagon. The adaptation's libretto and musical score combine African-American spirituals, soul, rock and roll, and folk music into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle. It was performed as part of The Public Theater's 2015 Under the Radar Festival in New York City.\n\n\"Kindred\" was adapted as a graphic novel by author Damien Duffy and artist John Jennings. The adaptation was published by Abrams ComicsArts on January 10, 2017. To visually differentiate the time periods in which Butler set the story, Jennings used muted colors for the present and vibrant ones for the past to demonstrate how the remnants and relevance of slavery are still with us. The graphic novel adaption debuted as number one \"New York Times\" hardcover graphic book bestseller on January 29, 2017.\n\n\"Dawn\" is currently being adapted for television by producers Ava DuVernay and Charles D. King's Macro Ventures, alongside writer Victoria Mahoney. This is the first time that Octavia Butler's work has been adapted for television. There is no projected release date for the adaptation yet.\n\n\nOn June 22, 2018, which would have been Butler's 71st birthday, Google featured her in a Google Doodle in the United States.\n\nThe Octavia E. Butler Memorial Scholarship was established in Butler's memory in 2006 by the Carl Brandon Society. Its goal is to provide an annual scholarship to enable writers of color to attend the Clarion West Writers Workshop and Clarion Writers' Workshop, descendants of the original Clarion Science Fiction Writers' Workshop in Clarion, Pennsylvania, where Butler got her start. The first scholarships were awarded in 2007.\n\n\"Patternist series\"\n\n\"Xenogenesis series\"\n\n\"Parable series\" (also called the \"Earthseed series\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the grandson of paramount chief Masaku after whom the town and the district were named. The family moved from Kiima Kimwe to a new settlement at Kangundo Division in a small village called Mbilini in 1929. This was a mountainous area with good rainfall for agriculture. His father had been converted to Christianity by the Africa Inland Mission.\n\nNgei attended primary school at DEB Kangundo from 1932, intermediate school at Kwa Mating'i in Machakos town from 1936, and Alliance High School in Kiambu District. He then joined the army in the King's African Rifles (KAR) for a four-year stint. After that he enrolled at Makerere University in Uganda as a journalism student from 1948–1950.\n\nThe anti-colonial movement gathered mometum in Kenya in the 1940s. A political upsurge led to the Mau Mau rebellion, which involved several tribes: the Luos, Nandis, Maasai, Kamba, Kikuyus, Merus and Embus.\n\nThe declaration of a state of emergency in October 1952 led to the arrest of Ngei, Jomo Kenyatta and others. Ngei earned Kenyatta's undying friendship when, during their imprisonment in Lodwar, Ngei physically stopped a colonial jailer from beating up Kenyatta by seizing the whip and challenging the jailer to beat him (Ngei) first. The \"Kapenguria Six\" included Fred Kubai, Bildad Kaggia, Achieng Oneko and Kung'u Karumba. The last surviving member, Oneko, died on 9 June 2007. Mashujaa Day, which until recently was known as Kenyatta Day is a national holiday in Kenya held every year to commemorate the detention of the six on 20 October 1952.\n\nThey were released nine years later, in 1961, two years before Kenya gained independence. The following year Ngei established the African People's Party.\n\nNgei's history generates much interest when examined within the context of these post-World War II protest politics that eventually ushered in independence for Kenya. These were protest politics characterised by party politics and violence as was manifested by the Mau Mau rebellion. Ngei lived and actively participated in both of these facets of Kenya's historical trajectory.\n\nHe came from the Akamba people of Kenya, who were the driving force for the first political protest against the British in 1937 led by Samuel Muindi Mbingu.\n\nNgei was the Kangundo Constituency MP from 1969 to 1990. He served throughout the Jomo Kenyatta government from 1964–1978 as a cabinet minister and in the post-Kenyatta government led by President Daniel arap Moi from 1978–1990 where he held several ministerial positions. In 1990 he was ruled bankrupt by court and consequently had to give up his parliamentary seat.\n\nNgei died in August 2004 at the age of 81 after suffering from diabetes. A mausoleum was built in Mbilini, Kangundo, the constituency he had served for 27 years, by the Kenyan government and unveiled in 2006. On 20 October 2016, the president of the Republic of Kenya unveiled a statue in honour of Paul Ngei at Chumvi town which is in the junction that leads to Machakos from the Mombasa Highway. This was during the celebrations of the year's Heroes' Day which were held in Machakos. The Jubilee Government committed to have national days celebrated outside the capital, Nairobi.\n"}
{"id": "15028384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15028384", "title": "Personal life of Frank Sinatra", "text": "Personal life of Frank Sinatra\n\nFrank Sinatra had many close relationships throughout his life. He was married four times and had at least six other notable relationships in between. He had three verified children, as well as more than one of questionable relationship.\n\nFrank Sinatra met Nancy Rose Barbato (March 25, 1917 – July 13, 2018) when he was nineteen, and they were married on February 4, 1939, in Jersey City, New Jersey, Barbato's home town. Their wedding was held at Our Lady of Sorrows Church at 93 Clerk Street, after which the newlyweds resided in an apartment house at 137 Bergen Avenue. Their first child, their elder daughter Nancy Sinatra, was born on June 8, 1940, and their son, Francis Wayne Sinatra, known as Frank Sinatra Jr., was born on January 10, 1944. Both children were born at the Margaret Hague Hospital in Jersey City.\n\nFollowing their move to Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, Sinatra errantly strayed from his marriage into extra-marital affairs, the first known with Marilyn Maxwell. These affairs also became public knowledge and caused great embarrassment to Nancy Barbato Sinatra, who considered calling off their marriage then and had an abortion when she became pregnant in 1946. A third child, Christina Sinatra, known as \"Tina\", was born on June 20, 1948.\n\nNancy Barbato Sinatra and Frank Sinatra announced their separation on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1950, with Frank's additional extra-marital affair with Ava Gardner compounding his transgressions and becoming public knowledge once again. After originally just seeking a legal separation, Frank and Nancy Sinatra decided some months later to file for divorce, and this divorce became legally final on October 29, 1951. Frank Sinatra's affair and relationship with Gardner had become more and more serious, and she later became his second wife.\n\nWhat was perhaps less widely known was the fact of Sinatra’s continuing visits; his long, confiding late-night phone calls; and the convivial family dinners on birthdays, holidays and many other occasions. “Throughout the many years after they split, my grandfather came to visit whenever his crazy life would allow it,” Mrs. Sinatra’s granddaughter A. J. Lambert wrote in a 2015 remembrance in Vanity Fair. “I can remember times when she would be on the phone with her ex-husband, and the next thing I knew some eggplant was coming out of the freezer to thaw so that she could make him some sandwiches when he showed up.” She remained profoundly private, uttering barely a word in public about her life with Sinatra, though their mutual feelings were clear, her granddaughter recalled, to those who knew them best.\n\n“I know he never stopped loving her,” Ms. Lambert wrote. “And I know she never stopped loving him.” \n\nNancy Barbato Sinatra died in 2018 at the age of 101, she was never remarried and having outlived not only her ex-husband, but also her son Frank Jr. as well, who died in 2016.\n\nKitty Kelley claims that Sinatra had first seen photographs of Ava Gardner in a magazine and had sworn that he would marry her. Ruth Rosenthal, a friend of Gardner's, stated that Gardner initially detested him upon meeting him at MGM, finding him to be \"conceited, arrogant and overpowering\". Their similarities, however, from vices like smoking, drinking hard liquor and cursing, to their volatile tempers and love of violent sports, soon became apparent. Sinatra separated from Nancy on Valentine's Day 1950, after he confessed to his passionate affair with Gardner, and she subsequently locked him out of the house and hired a lawyer. Although Nancy initially refused to divorce him, Sinatra was eventually granted a divorce in Nevada in October 1951, and subsequently obtained a marriage license in Pennsylvania, marrying Gardner in a small ceremony on November 7, 1951. A turbulent marriage, with many well-publicized fights and altercations, and an abortion in November 1952, the couple formally announced their separation on October 29, 1953 through MGM. Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, at a time when she was dating matador Luis Miguel Dominguín, but the divorce wasn't settled until July 1957. Sinatra blamed Peter Lawford for the split, who had dated Gardner before, and it took six years for Sinatra to forgive him. He was inconsolable in the fall of 1953 after the split, and according to Kelley, on November 18, Van Heusen found him in the elevator of his 57th Street apartment with his wrists slashed. Sinatra took responsibility for Gardner's business affairs long after the split, and was still dealing with her finances in 1976. When she fell into financial difficulty in later years, Sinatra paid $50,000 towards her medical bills. Gardner's power in Hollywood helped Sinatra get cast in \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953) and his subsequent Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor helped revitalize Sinatra's film career.\n\nSinatra married actress Mia Farrow on July 19, 1966, when she was 21 and he was 50. At the time, Sinatra was enjoying a wave of renewed popularity as the song \"Strangers in the Night\" returned him to the top of the \"Billboard\" charts only seventeen days later. They met on the set of Sinatra's film, \"Von Ryan's Express\". She agreed to appear in his 1968 film, \"The Detective\", but when she reneged as her filming schedule for \"Rosemary's Baby\" overran, Sinatra served her divorce papers in front of the cast and crew. They were divorced in Mexico in August 1968. In an interview for the November 2013 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", Farrow said that she and Sinatra \"never really split up\" and answered \"possibly\" when asked if her son Ronan might be Sinatra's.\n\nOn July 11, 1976, Sinatra married Barbara Blakeley Marx (1927-2017) (formerly married to Zeppo Marx, the straight man in the Marx brothers' act), who converted to Catholicism to marry him. She remained his wife until his death, although her relations with Sinatra's children were consistently portrayed as stormy, something Nancy Sinatra confirmed when she publicly claimed that Barbara had not bothered to call Frank's children even when the end was near, although they were close by, and the children missed the opportunity to be at their father's bedside when he died.\n\nSinatra had numerous extra-marital affairs, the first of which was with blonde starlet Alora Gooding from October 1940 while in Hollywood, his \"first big love away from home\" according to Nick Sevano. Next followed Rita Maritt, a 16-year-old Long Island debutante, the daughter of an oil baron, and Mary Lou Watts, a wealthy socialite. Gossip magazines published details of affairs with the likes of Lana Turner and Marilyn Maxwell.\n\nSummers and Swan claimed that Turner had gushed of a \"very serious affair\" between the two, and that they had only faked splitting up their relationship to oblige to MGM's concerns. Turner later denied the claims in her 1992 autobiography, saying that \"the closest things to dates Frank and I enjoyed were a few box lunches at MGM\".\n\nSinatra and Judy Garland remained good friends up until her death in 1969, but on only two occasions were the two legendary singers romantically involved. The first was in 1949, when Garland was recovering from a nervous breakdown and the two went on a romantic rendezvous in the Hamptons (Garland was still married to director Vincente Minnelli). The second was during one of Garland's many separations from her third husband Sid Luft in 1955. Sinatra had just come off his messy separation from Ava Gardner and was spotted in Garland's company until Luft found out.\n\nSinatra was very close to Lauren Bacall. According to Kelley, her husband Humphrey Bogart believed that Sinatra was in love with Bacall and failed to attend the Sands on Bacall's 32nd birthday out of jealousy, though the two men were on good terms. Sinatra and Bacall were frequently seen together in public throughout 1957, and on March 11, 1958, they reportedly became engaged, though Sinatra denied intending to marry her.\n\nSinatra was also engaged to India-born South African actress and dancer Juliet Prowse for a short while from fall 1961 to early 1962, before Sinatra broke the engagement late that year because Prowse refused to give up her career. The two first met on the set of the 1960 film \"Can-Can\".\n\nSinatra met Marilyn Monroe in 1954 (while he was still married to Ava Gardner, although some sources say that Sinatra and Monroe first met several years earlier) and was a friend of Monroe's second husband Joe DiMaggio, and after DiMaggio and Monroe divorced, he joined his friend DiMaggio and the writer James Bacon on a raid set up by DiMaggio himself in pursuit of his ex-wife (Monroe) and her lover Hal Schafer, and instead of raiding their apartment, they raided the apartment of another woman, whose name was Florence Kotz. In summer of 1961, Sinatra saw Monroe again and began an affair with her, and Monroe talked about marrying Sinatra, but Sinatra broke off the affair in fall of 1961 (around the same time he saw Juliet Prowse).\n\nSinatra was romantically involved with Angie Dickinson off and on for ten years from around 1954 to 1964. \"We had an incredible 'like' for each other\" and \"a very comfortable relationship\", stated Dickinson in 1999, adding that if they'd had \"a burning love affair\" then the romance might not have lasted as long. The two remained friends until Sinatra's 1998 death.\n\nSinatra had three children with his first wife, Nancy Barbato: Nancy Sinatra (born June 8, 1940), Frank Sinatra Jr. (born January 10, 1944 and died March 16, 2016), and Christina \"Tina\" Sinatra (born June 20, 1948). Although Sinatra did not remain faithful to his wife, he was by many accounts a devoted father.\n\nOn December 8, 1963, Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped. Sinatra paid the kidnappers' $240,000 ransom demand (even offering $1,000,000 though the kidnappers bizarrely turned down this offer), and his son was released unharmed on December 10. Because the kidnappers demanded that Sinatra call them only from pay phones, Sinatra carried a roll of dimes with him throughout the ordeal, and this became a lifetime habit. The kidnappers were subsequently apprehended and convicted. A movie called \"Stealing Sinatra\" was made about the incident. The radio program \"This American Life\" interviewed one of the kidnappers, Barry Keenan, in the 2002 episode \"Plan B\".\n\nJulie Sinatra (born Julie Ann Maria Lyma on February 10, 1943) claims to be Sinatra's daughter through an unacknowledged affair that he had with a showgirl, Dorothy Bunocelli, in the 1940s. She legally changed her last name to Sinatra in 2000. Awarded $100,000 by the Sinatra estate in 2002, elements of her story concerning her mother's trip to Cuba with Sinatra have been disputed.\n\nIn an interview for the November 2013 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", Farrow said that she and Sinatra \"never really split up\" and answered \"possibly\" when asked if her son Ronan Farrow might be Sinatra's.\n\nIn his spare time, Sinatra enjoyed listening to classical music, and would attend concerts when he could. He also liked opera, particularly Luciano Pavarotti, and told himself, \"I'm just a wop baritone. This guy can really sing\". In return, music critic Henry Pleasants said that he had rarely interviewed an opera singer who did not have a collection of Sinatra's recordings. Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that Sinatra had \"great inner strength\", and that his energy and drive was \"enormous\". A workaholic, he reportedly only slept for four hours a night on average. Rojek considers him to have been an \"overtly sexual performer, caressing the microphone and standing in a suggestive manner\". Impeccable with his dress and cleanliness, while with the Tommy Dorsey band he developed the nickname \"Lady Macbeth\", because of frequent showering and switching his outfits. He enjoyed golf, and would often play with golf champion Ken Venturi at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived.\n\nThroughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that \"I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation\". Avoiding solitude and unglamorous surroundings at all costs, he struggled with the conflicting need \"to get away from it all, but not too far away.\" Anthony Quinn once stated that he had a \"cruel streak in his personality\", but that he still loved him as he was \"what all men are and not one man in a million ever is\". Sinatra's mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists and photographers. He received negative press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in Houston in 1950, and Judy Garland's publicist Jim Byron in 1954, whom he reportedly referred to as a \"fucking parasite\". Yet Sinatra was known for his generosity, particularly after his comeback. When Lee J. Cobb nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with \"books, flowers, delicacies\", paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his finest acting was yet to come. In another instance, after a heated argument with manager Bobby Burns, rather than apologize, Sinatra bought him a brand new Cadillac.\n\nIn a 1963 interview with \"Playboy\" magazine, Sinatra stated that his belief in God was similar to Albert Schweitzer, Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein in that had a \"respect for life – in any form\", but didn't believe in \"a personal God to whom I look for comfort or for a natural on the next roll of the dice\". According to Kelley, he was critical of the church on numerous occasions, and had thought it hypocritical in Hoboken that Italians had to attend a different church from the Irish and Germans. Though turned off by organized religion at times, however, Sinatra had a deep faith that became public when he turned to the Catholic Church for healing after his mother died in a plane crash late in his career. He died as a practicing Catholic and had a Catholic burial.\n\nIn 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, straddling the border between Nevada and California on the shores of Lake Tahoe. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted the likes of the other Rat Pack members, Red Skelton, Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel. Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after mobster Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises. Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission and mobster control of casinos, and trouble with the Mafia, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands.\n\nSinatra became the stereotype of the \"tough working-class Italian American\", something which he embraced. He commented that he would \"probably have ended in a life of crime\" if it had not been for his interest in music. According to one writer, Eddie Fisher once remarked that Sinatra \"wanted to be a hood\" and had once told him that \"I'd rather be a don of the Mafia than president of the United States\". However, Peter Lawford had said that Sinatra only referred to them as the \"boys\" or \"the Outfit\", rather than the \"Mafia\".\n\nIn Sinatra's early days, mafia boss Willie Moretti helped him for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing him from his contract with Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra was present at the Mafia Havana Conference in 1946, and one newspaper published the headline \"Shame, Sinatra\" regarding his connection with Lucky Luciano. Kelley claims that Phyllis McGuire referred to Sam Giancana and Sinatra as the \"best of friends\", saying that they would often play golf together in Nevada and visit each other. She also quotes Jo-Carrol Silvers in saying that both Sinatra and her husband Phil Silvers \"adored Bugsy Siegel so much\", and would boast to friends about him and how many people he had killed. She also claimed that Silvers had told her that \"like Bugsy, Frank had a Mafia Redneck mentality\", with their shared love of high-living and grandiose plans in Las Vegas. Kelley claims that Sinatra and mobster Joseph Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward, and acted like \"Sicilian brothers\". She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial partners in the gossip magazine \"Hollywood Night Life\" with Mickey Cohen, a West Coast mobster; she claims that Sinatra funded $15,000 into the magazine to \"get back at Hollywood\".\nThe FBI kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, becoming a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent New Deal politics, and his friendship with John F. Kennedy. They kept him under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of death threats and extortion schemes. The FBI documented that Sinatra was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, whose brother Bobby was leading a crackdown on organized crime. They wiretapped Giancana's conversations, and found that Giancana no longer trusted Sinatra after he had been spotted with Kennedy. Their purported friendship finally came to an end in 1963 following the Nevada Gaming Commission's investigation into the casinos. According to Kelley, Giancana blamed Sinatra for the ordeal.\n\nThe FBI's secret dossier on Sinatra was released in 1998 in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. Sinatra frequently denied personal and professional links with organized crime figures such as Bugsy Siegel, Carlo Gambino, Sam Giancana, Lucky Luciano, and Joseph Fischetti, despite the many connections and anecdotes reported. He vehemently declared that \"any report that I fraternised with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie\". In January 1967, he stood before a Las Vegas grand jury investigating mobster influence in the casinos and denied any financial exploits with Giancana.\n\n"}

He is best known for his role as host of \"Nighthawks\", a RTÉ Television chat show of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for composing \"What's Another Year\", Ireland's winning entry in the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nShay Healy was raised along with his five siblings in Sandymount in Dublin. His father, Seamus, was a civil servant and part-time stage actor who performed at the Abbey and Olympia theatres. His mother, Máirín Ní Shúilleabháin, was a singer of Irish traditional songs. She also wrote plays and stories and encouraged young Shay's early talent for writing. This led to his first appearance at the age of fifteen on the Irish national radio station, Radió Éireann, reading a self-penned article.\n\nHealy has had a varied career to date, never focusing too intently on any one of his various professional interests. Of his tendency to diversify he has commented: \"I know it infuriates some people when you don't pigeonhole yourself, but I don't take on anything that won't stand up to public scrutiny.\"\n\nHealy first received attention as a performer of his own \"songs of social significance\" during the 1960s. Later he wrote comedy songs for Billy Connolly, including \"The Orient Express-a tale of intrigue and cross dressing\", \"The Shitkickers Waltz\", and \"The Country & Western Supersong\". Healy achieved his greatest success as a songwriter with \"What's Another Year\", which won the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest. Over the course of the next fifteen years, the song earned him a total of £250,000. In 1983 his song, \"Edge Of The Universe\", sung by Linda Martin, was the overall winner of the Castlebar Song Contest. Under the name of Crack, he and Dave Pennefather released a parody song called \"Silly Fellow\", which was about Paul McCartney's arrest and jail experience in Japan. \n\nIn 1977, Healy branched into musical theatre with the script, co-written with Niall Toibin, for a stage production entitled \"The King\". This was a show based on the life and music of Elvis Presley and was premiered at the Cork Opera House two months after the singer's death. In contrast, Healy's rock opera, \"The Knowledge\", failed to receive commercial backing and was premiered in Dundalk by an amateur group in January 1989.\n\nHealy was more successful with his musical, \"The Wiremen\", which received its premiere on 4 May 2005 at Dublin's Gaiety Theatre in a production by John McColgan and Moya Doherty that ran for six weeks. \"The Wiremen\" tells the story of the introduction of electricity into County Mayo during the 1950s. In March 2010 the show was revived in an amateur production by the Birr Stage Guild.\n\nHealy joined RTÉ Television in 1963 as a trainee cameraman. Within five years he had moved to the other side of the lens with appearances on programmes such as \"Twenty Minutes With...\", \"Ballad Sheet\" and \"Hoot'nany\".\n\nBetween 1988 and 1992 Healy hosted \"Nighthawks\", a late-night satirical chat show broadcast on RTÉ Two, which he later described as \"the best four years of my working life\". In January 1992, the show became embroiled in political controversy as a result of Healy's interview with former Fianna Fáil Justice Minister Seán Doherty. During the interview, Doherty revealed that some members of the cabinet with whom he served in 1982 had been aware of his order to illegally tap the phones of a number of Irish journalists. The revelation led to the resignation of Taoiseach Charles Haughey a few weeks later.\n\nIn January 1995, RTÉ terminated Healy's contract. One of his last shows for the station was \"Where Are They Now?\" in which he interviewed former celebrities whose fame had largely faded. Healy then set up his own production company which made a series of television documentaries. His 1995 TV documentary on Irish musician, Phil Lynott, \"The Rocker\", was broadcast on RTÉ Two and BBC Two, and later released as a DVD. In 1998, Healy made two half-hour documentaries for the RTÉ One television series, \"Against The Odds\". The series focused on individuals who had overcome adversity in their lives. Healy's two films featured an actor, Chris Burke, who was born with dwarfism, and a singer, Ronan Tynan, whose legs were amputated when he was twenty.\n\nAmong the other TV programmes Healy presented were \"Reach For The Stars\" (1971), \"Hullaballoo\" (1977), \"The Birthday Show\" (1993-1995), and \"Beastly Behaviour\" (1998-1999).\n\nHealy has won two Jacob's Awards. He received the first in 1984 for \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", a radio documentary series on the 1960s in Ireland, which he presented and Siobhan McHugh produced. His second award came in 1989 for his television work.\n\nIn 2007, Healy joined the judging panel on TG4's talent show, \"Glór Tíre\".\n\nIn the early 1960s, Healy became Folk Correspondent for \"Spotlight\", an Irish pop music weekly, and he continued to write for the magazine until its demise in the mid-1970s. He currently writes a weekly column for the \"Irish Daily Mail\".\n\n\"The Stunt\" is the title of Healy's debut novel, published in 1992. It deals with the Irish rock scene and was described by one reviewer as \"a more truthful... representation (of) the Irish music scene than \"The Commitments\"\". His second novel, \"Green Card Blues\", is set among the illegal Irish immigrant community in New York City.\n\nIn 2005 \"On The Road\", Healy's memoir of his life in showbusiness, was published.\n\nHealy was married to Dymphna Errity from September 1967 up to her death on 10 July 2017. They have two sons, Oisin and Fionain.\n\nIn 2004, Healy was diagnosed with the degenerative disorder, Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n"}

Chilton (August 14, 1899 – September 15, 1972) was a chemical engineer and professor. He is considered a founder of modern chemical engineering practice and lectured widely around the world. He received numerous awards, including an honorary doctorate and the President's Certificate of Merit. In 1994, DuPont named a laboratory in Wilmington, Delaware for him.\n\nThomas Hamilton Chilton was born in Greensboro, Alabama, son of a Methodist Episcopal clergyman, poet and hymnodist, Claudius Lysias Chilton, and Mabel Pierce Chilton. He was given the middle name Hamilton to honor a friend of the family. Chilton grew up in Montgomery, Alabama with the peculiar distinction of being the ninth child of a ninth child of a ninth child. Two older brothers founded Paragon Press and put him to work at a printing press, setting type by hand, which taught him to be attentive to detail. He attended Sidney Lanier High School in Montgomery, where he heard an employee of Thomas Edison explain how to make synthetic phonograph records. This sparked an interest in chemical engineering.\n\nChilton attended the University of Alabama for two semesters, quitting to earn money for tuition. He moved to New York City in 1917, moving in with his eldest brother. He attended Columbia University, graduating in 1922 with a degree in chemical engineering. He began work as a research chemist in New York, receiving his first patent. In 1925, he joined DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware, beginning what became a 35-year career leading its chemical research. Chilton began his career just as chemical engineering was becoming established as its own discipline and he is considered to be one of the founders of modern chemical engineering practice. He and a colleague developed the Chilton-Colburn analogy, which became a fundamental principle of chemical engineering. Chilton was known for his work on fluid flow, heat transfer, distillation and absorption. He began lecturing at universities in 1937.\n\nChilton worked at DuPont from 1925–1959, leading its chemical research. During World War II, he worked with the Manhattan Project and he was involved with the original design of the first atomic energy plant, the Hanford Engineer Works. At the invitation of his colleague and friend, Enrico Fermi, Chilton was among the select group of scientists to witness the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at Stagg Field on December 2, 1942. After the war, he became involved in the Savannah River Plant, then the largest nuclear power plant ever built by the Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nUpon his retirement, Chilton, who was known for being very particular about punctuation, was presented by his co-workers with a book that was entirely bereft of punctuation until the back of the book, where there was a page of periods, commas, semicolons, colons and other punctuation, accompanied by an invitation for him to insert them at his discretion.\n\nChilton was active in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and served as its president in 1951. Following his career at DuPont, Chilton was a visiting professor and lecturer all over the world, including the University of Kyoto and Nagoya University, where he was a Fulbright lecturer; the University of New South Wales in Australia; and universities in Toulouse and Nancy, France, again as a Fulbright lecturer. He also lectured at the Birla Institute of Technology in Pilani, India and the University of Natal in South Africa. His stints at American universities included the University of California, Berkeley, Georgia Tech, the University of Delaware, the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Alabama.\n\nChilton died in Bonn, Germany while traveling with his second wife.\n\nChilton was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Delaware in 1943. He received several awards from his alma mater, the Charles Frederick Chandler Medal in 1939, the Egleston Medal in 1942 and in 1950, the University Medal, which was presented to him by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1948, he received the President's Certificate of Merit for his contributions to the National Defense Research Committee. Chilton was posthumously awarded the Lavoisier Medal for excellence. In 1994, the building where he had conducted much of his work for DuPont was named after him.\n\nChilton spoke fluent French and enjoyed classical music. He had a collection of photographic slides from his world travels. As a boy Tomas began the hobby of collecting automobile license plates. Eventually, he was recognized as having the world's largest collection (some 4,500) from all over the United States and around the world. In 1967, an article about this amazing collection appeared in Sports Illustrated. His first wife was Cherridah McLemore and after her death, he married Elizabeth C. Rhinehart, who, along with her late husband, had been friends of the Chiltons for decades.\n\nThomas H. Chilton is a grandson of William Parish Chilton, a member of the congress of the Confederate States of America and the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In 1967 he published a genealogical reference called \"Antecedents and Descendants of William Parish Chilton, 1810 - 1871\". \" Bart Chilton, a former commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is his grandson.\n\n"}
{"id": "227446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227446", "title": "Yngvi", "text": "Yngvi\n\nOld Norse Yngvi, Old High German Inguin and Old English Ingƿine are names that relate to a theonym which appears to have been the older name for the god Freyr. Proto-Germanic *Ingwaz was the legendary ancestor of the Ingaevones, or more accurately \"Ingvaeones\", and is also the reconstructed name of the Elder Futhark rune ᛜ and Anglo-Saxon rune ᛝ, representing \"ŋ\".\n\nA torc, the so-called \"Ring of Pietroassa\", part of a late third to fourth century Gothic hoard discovered in Romania, is inscribed in much-damaged runes, one reading of which is \"gutanī [i(ng)]wi[n] hailag\" \"to Ingwi[n] of the Goths holy\".\n\nOld Norse \"Yngvi\" as well as Old High German \"Inguin\" and Old English \"Ingƿine\" are all derived from the Proto-Germanic *Ingwaz. Sound changes in late-Proto-Germanic transformed *Ingwaz into *Ingwi(z) in the nominative case and *\"Ingwin\" in the accusative case. That his epithet *Fraujaz appears in Old Norse compounds \"Ingvifreyr\" and \"Ingunarfreyr\", as well as in Old English \"fréa inguina\", both of which mean 'Lord of the Inguins', i. e. the god Freyr, strongly indicates that the two deities are either the same or were syncretized at some very early period in the Germanic migration (or possibly before). The Ingvaeones, who occupied a territory roughly equivalent to modern Denmark, Frisia and the Low Countries at the turn of the millennium, were mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his \"Natural Histories\" as one of \"five Germanic tribes\". Tacitus asserts their descent from the three sons of Mannus or *Mannaz, the Proto-Germanic 'first man', of whom *Ingwaz may have been one. Other names that retain the theonym are \"Inguiomerus\" or \"Ingemar\" and \"Yngling\", the name of an old Scandinavian dynasty.\n\nThe ' rune (with variants and ) together with Peorð and Eihwaz is among the problematic cases of runes of uncertain derivation unattested in early inscriptions. The rune first appears independently on the \"futhark\" row of the Kylver Stone, and is altogether unattested as an independent rune outside of such rows. There are a number of attestations of the ' bind rune or (the \"lantern rune\", similar in shape to the Anglo-Saxon gēr rune ), but its identification is disputed in most cases, since the same sign may also be a cipher rune of wynn or thurisaz. The earliest case of such an ' bindrune of reasonably certain reading is the inscription ' (perhaps referring to the \"Mærings\" or Ostrogoths) on the silver buckle of Szabadbattyán, dated to the first half 5th century and conserved at the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.\n\nThe Old English rune poem contains these obscure lines:\n\nIn Norse mythology, Yngvi, alternatively spelled Yngve, was the progenitor of the Yngling lineage, a legendary dynasty of Swedish kings, from whom also the earliest historical Norwegian kings claimed to be descended. Yngvi is a name of the god Freyr, perhaps Freyr's true name, as \"freyr\" means 'lord' and has probably evolved from a common invocation of the god.\n\nIn the \"Íslendingabók\" (written in the early twelfth century by the Icelandic priest Ari Þorgilsson) \"Yngvi Tyrkja konungr\" 'Yngvi king of Turkey' appears as the father of Njörðr who in turn is the father of Yngvi-Freyr, ancestor of the Ynglings. According to the \"Skjöldunga saga\" (a lost epic from 1180–1200, saved only partially in other sagas and later translation) Odin came from Asia and conquered Northern Europe. He gave Sweden to his son Yngvi and Denmark to his son Skjöldr. Since then the kings of Sweden were called Ynglings and those of Denmark Skjöldungs.\n\nIn the \"Gesta Danorum\" (late twelfth century, by Saxo Grammaticus) and in the \"Ynglinga saga\" (ca. 1225, by Snorri Sturluson), Freyr is euhemerized as a king of Sweden. In the \"Ynglinga saga\", Yngvi-Freyr reigned in succession to his father Njörðr who had – in this variant – succeeded Odin. In the \"Historia Norwegiæ\" (written around 1211), in contrast, Ingui is the first king of Sweden, and the father of a certain Neorth, in his turn the father of Froyr: \"Rex itaque Ingui, quem primum Swethiæ monarchiam rexisse plurimi astruunt, genuit Neorth, qui vero genuit Froy; hos ambos tota illorum posteritas per longa sæcula ut deos venerati sunt. Froyr vero genuit Fiolni, qui in dolio medonis dimersus est […]\"\n\nIn the introduction to his \"Edda\" (originally composed around 1220) Snorri Sturluson claimed again that Odin reigned in Sweden and relates: \"Odin had with him one of his sons called Yngvi, who was king in Sweden after him; and those houses come from him that are named Ynglings.\" Snorri here does not identify Yngvi and Freyr, although Freyr occasionally appears elsewhere as a son of Odin instead of a son of Njörðr.\n\nIn the \"Skáldskaparmál\" section of his \"Prose Edda\" Snorri brings in the ancient king Halfdan the Old who is the father of nine sons whose names are all words meaning \"king\" or \"lord\" in Old Norse, as well as of nine other sons who are the forefathers of various royal lineages, including \"Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are descended\". But rather oddly Snorri immediately follows this with information on what should be four other personages who were not sons of Halfdan but who also fathered dynasties, and names the first of these again as \"Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are descended\". In the related account in the \"Ættartolur\" \"Genealogies\" attached to \"Hversu Noregr byggðist\", the name \"Skelfir\" appears instead of \"Yngvi\" in the list of Halfdan's sons.\n\nThe \"Ynglinga Saga\" section of Snorri's \"Heimskringla\" (around 1230) introduces a second Yngvi, son of Alrekr, who is a descendant of Yngvi-Freyr and who shared the Swedish kingship with his brother Álf (\"see\" Yngvi and Alf).\n\nThe element \"Ing(o)-\" was widely used in Germanic names from an early period; it is not clear whether it originally referred to the Ingaevones, or to the god Yngwi directly. \"Inguiomer\" was a relative of the Cheruscan Arminius in the first century. \"Ingundis\" was a wife of the Frankish king Chlothar I, whose son Charibert I married an \"Ingoberga\" (all in the sixth century). Other combinations such as masculine \"Inguin\", \"Ingulf\", \"Ingobald\", feminine \"Inghildis\", \"Ingedrudis\", \"Ingoflidis\", as well as the short forms \"Ingo\" (masculine) and \"Inga\" (feminine) are recorded in the early medieval period (seventh to ninth centuries). In Scandinavia and Germany, and areas where these groups settled, names beginning with \"Ing\" survived into modern usage, e.g.Ingmar, Ingvar, Ingvild, Ingeborg, Ingrid, Ingegerd and the family name Ingalls.\n\n"}

He dropped out of middle school in order to accompany his father to an international conference of legislators in France, and stayed on, working his way through the Law Department of Paris University. He was greatly influenced by the philosophy of Romain Rolland and the \"Clarté\" (\"Clarity\") movement of the French novelist, Henri Barbusse, which encouraged him to participate in pacifist activities.\n\nKomaki returned to Japan in 1919 and founded the literary magazine \"Tane Maku Hito\" (\"The Sowers\") in October 1921, named after the famous painting by the French artist Jean-François Millet. He used this as his platform to promote his pacifist and Marxist ideals through poems and essays, many of which he wrote. He was one of the first Japanese members of Comintern, and a pioneer in the Proletarian literature movement. The movement attracted the attention of Arishima Takeo, and other noted leftist writers. In 1924 another literary magazine \"Bungei Sensen\" (\"Literary Battlefront\") spun out from the original \"Tane Maku Hito\" group.\n\nWhen Komaki had spare time from promoting communist revolution and avoiding the thought police, he worked at translating works of French literature into Japanese. His most noted works are translations of Charles-Louis Philippe's \"Dans la Petite Ville\" and André Gide's biography, \"Charles-Louis Philippe\".\n\nAfter World War II, Komaki became a professor at Hosei University, and continued to pursue his pacifist and Marxist philosophies.\n\nHis works include \"Ikoku no Senso\" (Other Countries’ Wars) and \"Furansu Kakumei Yobanashi\" (Evening Conversations on the French Revolution).\nKomaki relocated from Tokyo to Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture in 1925. He later spent some years in French Indochina, but returned after World War II to Kamakura, where he lived until his death in 1978 at the age of 84.\n\n\n"}
