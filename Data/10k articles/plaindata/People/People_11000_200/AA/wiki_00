{"id": "2152052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152052", "title": "Abū Lahab", "text": "Abū Lahab\n\nHis name is Abdul-Uzzai ibn Abdul-Muttalib ibn Hashim. According to Islamic narrations and inline with Arabic history, Abū Lahab () (c. 549 – 624) was Muhammad's paternal uncle. He is condemned in \"Surah al-Massad\", for being an enemy to Islam.\n\nHe was born in Mecca c. 549, the son of Abdul Muttalib, chief of the Hashim clan, and of Lubna bint Hajar, who was from the Khuza'a tribe.\nPeople from the Khuza'a tribe were the caretakers of the Ka'bah for several centuries, before the Quraysh took over the responsibility through their ancestor Qusai ibn Kilab. Abu Lahab was the half-uncle of Muḥammad since Muḥammad's grandmother was Fāṭimah bint ‘Amr of Banu Makhzūm clan.\n\nHis original name was 'Abd al-'Uzzā, but his father called him \"Abū Lahab\" (\"Father of Flame\") \"because of his beauty and charm\" due to his red (inflamed) cheeks. He is described as \"an artful spruce fellow with two locks of hair, wearing an Aden cloak\" and as \"very generous\".\n\nHe married Arwā Umm Jamīl bint Harb, sister of Abu Sufyān (Sakhr), whose father Ḥarb was chief of the Umayya clan. Their children included Utbah, Utaybah, Muattab, Durrah (Fakhita), 'Uzzā and Khālida. Abu Lahab had another son, also named Durrah, who may have been borne by another woman. He may also have been the father of Masruh, a son born to his slave Thuwayba.\n\nHis daughter Durrah embraced Islam and became a narrator of Hadīth. One is in Ahmad’s \"Musnad\", where she reports that a man got up and asked the Prophet, “Who is the best of the people?” He answered, “The best of the people is the most learned, the most godfearing, the most to be enjoining virtue, the most to be prohibiting vice and the most to be joining the kin.”\n\n‘Utbah also embraced Islam after the conquest of Mecca and pledged allegiance to Muḥammad.\n\nWhen Muhammad announced that he had been instructed by God to spread the message of Islam openly, the Quran told him to warn his kinsfolk about divine punishment. He therefore climbed Mount Ṣafā and shouted: \"Wa ṣabāḥah!\" which means, \"O calamity of the morning!\" In Arabia this alarm was traditionally raised by any person who noticed an enemy tribe advancing against his own tribe at dawn.\n\nOn hearing this, the inhabitants of Mecca assembled at the mountain. Muhammad then addressed the clans by name. \"O Banū Hāshim, O Banū 'Abd al-Muṭallib ... [and so on], if I were to tell you that behind this hill there is an enemy about to attack you, would you believe me?\" The people responded that they would, since Muhammad was known to be honest. He continued saying: \"Then I warn you that you are heading for a torment.\"\n\nAt this point, Abu Lahab interrupted: \"Woe be on you the rest of the day! Is that what you summoned us for?\" Another tradition recalls Abū Lahab picking up a stone to throw at his nephew.\n\nAbu Lahab rejected the claims of Muhammad and said: \"Muhammad promises me things which I do not see. He alleges that they will happen after my death; what has he put in my hands after that?” Then he blew on his hands and said, “May you perish. I can see nothing in you of the things that Muhammad says.”\n\nAs a direct result of this incident, a chapter of the Quran, \"Al-Masadd\" (\"The Palm Fibre\"), was revealed about him. Its English translation by Sahih International reads:\n\nIn the name of Allah, the most compassionate, the most merciful (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)\n\nUmm Jamil is called “the bearer of the wood” because she is said to have carried thorns and cast them in Muhammad's pathway. Being a next-door neighbor to Muḥammad, she also threw garbage over the wall into Muhammad's house.\n\nAbu Lahab had married two of his sons to the daughters of Muḥammad, 'Utbah to Ruqayyah and 'Utaibah to Umm Kulthum. However, the marriages were never consummated, presumably because the girls were so young. After the announcement of \"Al-Masadd\", Abu Lahab told his sons: \"My head is unlawful to your head if you do not divorce Muhammad's daughters.\" They therefore divorced them. Abu Lahab's daughter Durrah was at some stage married to Zaid ibn Ḥarīthah, who was at that time regarded as Muhammad's son, and they were later divorced; but the timing of this marriage and divorce is not known. Later, she married Ḥārith ibn Naufal of Banu Hāshim; and after his death, she married Dihya ibn Khalifa.\n\nWhen the Quraysh began to torture the Muslims, Abu Lahab's brother Abu Talib called upon the Hashim and Al-Muttalib clans to stand with him in protecting his nephew. It was a custom among the Arabs to staunchly support their own clan. Despite the dissension between Muḥammad and some members of Banu Hashim & Banu Muṭṭalib, most of them stood by him in his predicaments and provided him protection and security except Abu Lahab.\n\nOnce Abū Lahab asked Muḥammad: \"If I were to accept your religion, what would I get?\" Muḥammad replied: \"You would get what the other believers would get.\" Abū Lahab responded: \"Is there no preference or distinction for me?\" In which Muḥammad replied, \"What else do you want?\" Abū Lahab replied back: \"May this religion perish in which I and all other people should be equal and alike!\"\n\nWhile Muhammad was praying near the Kaaba, Abū Lahab once threw the entrails of a sacrificed camel over him. Muhammad later told Aisha: \"I was between two bad neighbours, Abu Lahab and Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt. They brought excrements and threw them before my door and they brought offensive material and threw it before my door.\" Muhammad said he came out of his house, saying: \"O sons of Abdumanaf! Is it the behaviour of a neighbour?\" and threw the rubbish away.\nHe was overjoyed and expressed his sheer happiness at the news of the death of ‘Abdullah, Muḥammad’s second son and celebrated it with ‘Āṣ ibn Wā’il, Abu Jahl and other enemies of Islam. Besides, they also dubbed Muḥammad “al-Abtar”. So Allah revealed Sūra al-Kaothar.\n\nOn the 7th year of preaching Islam, the Quraysh imposed boycott on Banu Hāshim & Banu Muṭṭalib and forced them to live in a mountain gorge outside the city. Most of the members of Banu Hāshim had not accepted Islam at that time. Yet they stood by Muḥammad and suffered as much as he did. Abu Lahab was the only member of Banu Hāshim who supported the boycott and did not join his clan. Through a deep sense of animosity, Abu Lahab violated this ‘Arab tradition and took the side of non-Muslim Quraysh clans. Abu Lahab renounced his affiliation with the Hashim clan and remained in Mecca. Soon afterwards, he met his sister-in-law, Hind bint Utbah, and said to her, \"Haven’t I helped Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, and haven’t I abandoned those who have abandoned them and assisted their opponents?” She replied, “Yes, and may god reward you well, O Abu Utba.”\n\nAfter the boycott was lifted, another nephew, Abu Salama, came to Abu Talib asking for protection. When the Makhzum clan protested about this, Abu Lahab supported his brother. He told the Makhzumites: “O Quraysh, you have continually attacked this \"shaykh\" for giving his protection among his own people. By God, you must either stop this or we will stand in with him until he gains his object.” The Makhzumites wanted to keep Abu Lahab's support, and therefore they agreed not to annoy Abu Salama.\n\nAbu Talib died in 620, From this time, Muhammad went around the trade fairs and markets to tell the Arab tribes that he was a prophet and call them to worship Allah. Abu Lahab used to follow him around the fairs, saying, “This fellow wishes only to get you to strip off Al-Lat and Al-Uzza from your necks and your allies the \"jinn\" of the Malik ibn Uqaysh tribe for the misleading innovation he has brought. Don’t obey him and take no notice of him.”\n\nSomeone reported: “Before my own Islam I used to see the Prophet in markets outside Makkah calling out: ‘People, say there is no deity save Allah and you will prosper.’ People would gather around him but a man, bright faced, intelligent looking, with two locks of hair (hanging down), would appear from the rear and say: ‘This man has renounced the religion (of his forefathers). He is a liar.’ He followed the Prophet wherever he went. The people would enquire who he was to learn that it was his (the Prophet's) uncle.’”\n\nOnce Abu Lahab chased and hit Muḥammad with stones in one of those markets. He hit so hard that his feet began to bleed profusely and his slippers were filled with his own blood causing great pain and difficulty in walking.\n\nMuhammad and most of the Muslims left Mecca in 622, and Abu Lahab had no further direct interaction with his nephew.\n\nWhen the rest of the Quraysh went to Badr to protect the merchant-caravan carrying their property from an expected attack, Abu Lahab remained in Mecca, sending in his place Abu Jahl's brother al-‘Āṣ ibn Hishām ibn al-Mughīra who owed him four thousand dirhams that he could not pay. So he hired him with them on the condition that he should be cleared off his debt.\n\nThe first people to reach Mecca with the news of the Quraysh defeat in the Battle of Badr were al-Haysuman and 'Abdullāh ibn al-Khuzā'ī, who bewailed the fact that so many of their chieftains had fallen on the battlefield. Abu Lahab went to the large tent of Zamzam, \"his face as black as thunder\". Before long, his nephew Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith arrived, so he called him over for news. A small crowd gathered around the two as Abū Sufyān told his uncle, \"The facts are the Quraysh met our enemy and turned their backs. They [the Muslims] put us to flight, taking prisoners as they pleased. I cannot blame our tribesmen because they faced not only them but men wearing white robes riding piebald horses, who were between heaven and earth. They spared nothing, and no one had a chance.\"\n\nAt the other end of the tent, a Muslim freedman named Abu Rafi' and Abbas's wife Lubaba sat sharpening arrows. When they heard the news of the men in white riding between heaven and earth, they could no longer contain their happiness, and Abu Rafi exclaimed: \"They were angels!\" Abu Lahab was so furious that he forced the frail Abu Rafi' to the ground and beat him up. Lubaba grabbed a nearby tent pole and hit her brother-in-law over the head, crying: \"Do you think that you can abuse him just because Abbas is away?\"\n\nLubaba wounded Abu Lahab so severely that his head was split open, laying bare part of his skull. The wound turned septic, and his entire body erupted into open pustules. He died a week later. This would have been in late March 624.\n\nThe smell from Abu Lahab's wound was so repulsive that nobody could come near him. His family left his decaying body decomposing in his home for two or three nights until a neighbour rebuked them. \"It is disgraceful. You should be ashamed of leaving your father to rot in his house and not bury him from the sight of men!\" They then sent in slaves to remove his body. It was watered from a distance, then pushed with poles into a grave outside Mecca, and stones were thrown over it.\n\nA Muslim narration says that after Abu Lahab's death, some of his relatives had a dream in which they saw him suffering in Hell. He told them that he had experienced no comfort in the Afterlife, but that his sufferings had been remitted \"this much\" (indicating the space between his thumb and index finger) because of his one virtuous deed of manumitting his slave Thuwayba, who had briefly suckled Muhammad.\n"}

The rebels ransacked shops and houses and killed 39 Spanish inhabitants of the town. However, once the clergy took to the streets with the sacrament the Mestizo rebels stopped further bloodshed.

{"id": "1966154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966154", "title": "Bill Longley (gunfighter)", "text": "Bill Longley (gunfighter)\n\nWilliam Preston Longley (October 6, 1851 – October 11, 1878), also known as Wild Bill Longley, was an American Old West outlaw and gunfighter noted for his ruthless nature, speed with a gun, quick temper, and unpredictable demeanor. He is considered to have been one of the deadliest gunfighters in the Old West.\n\nBill Longley was born on Mill Creek in Austin County, Texas, the sixth of ten children of Campbell and Sarah Longley. His family moved when he was two years old and he was raised on a farm near Old Evergreen, Texas, in present-day Lincoln, Lee County, Texas, where he spent a large part of his childhood learning to shoot. He received an average education for the time. He was six feet (183 cm) tall with a thin build, jet black hair, and was just reaching adulthood when the American Civil War ended in 1865.\n\nBy 1867, Texas was fully under the control of the Union due to the Reconstruction Act. The military acted in all capacities, including law enforcement, which caused considerable resentment throughout the state. Around this time, Longley dropped out of school and began living a wild life, drinking, and running in the company of others of a similar disposition.\n\nIn 1867 the Longley family farm was just one mile from the Camino Real, an old Spanish royal highway that joined San Antonio and Nacogdoches, Texas.\n\nIn mid-December 1868, three former slaves named Green Evans, Pryer Evans, and the third known only as Ned, rode through Evergreen, intending evidently to visit friends further south. Longley, accompanied by a couple of friends, forced the three men at gunpoint into a dry creek bed. Green Evans panicked and spurred his horse to escape. Longley shot at him several times, killing him.\n\nLongley and his friends went through the dead man's pockets, as Pryer Evans and Ned rode away. Although given sole responsibility for the murder, Longley later claimed that he was not the only one shooting. Longley's account of this murder differs from that of his later killings, where he was more inclined to brag about shooting men than to try to divert blame to others. Some versions of Green's killing claim he was a member of the Texas State Police; the TSP only existed from 1870 to 1873.\n\nLongley drifted around Texas for a time, and while gambling in saloons he became acquainted with noted gambler, Phil Coe In 1869, Longley and his brother-in-law, John Wilson, embarked on a crime spree through southern Texas. Together they robbed settlers and in one instance killed a freed slave named Paul Brice in Bastrop County, Texas, after which they stole his horses. They also reportedly killed a freed slave woman in Evergreen.\n\nIn March 1870, a $1,000 reward for their capture was offered by the Union military authority. Longley later claimed that Wilson was killed by outlaws in 1870 in Brazos County, Texas, although conflicting evidence suggests he was killed in 1874 in Falls County, Texas.\n\nLongley left Texas and moved north to avoid the authorities and by May 1870, he had joined a gold-hunting party in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nThe gold mining party travelled into the Black Hills of South Dakota, but a treaty with the Sioux prohibited mining, and the party disbanded when intercepted by a U.S. cavalry unit. On June 22, 1870, Longley enlisted for a five-year commitment in the army, joining Company B of the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment. His unit was stationed at Camp Stambaugh. He deserted two weeks later, as he was unable to adapt to the strict lifestyle, but was captured and court-martialed. He was sentenced to two years hard labour, strapped to a ball and chain, and imprisoned at Camp Stambaugh. He was held for four months and then released to return to his unit. His marksmanship skills were noticed, and he was assigned to the regular hunting parties leaving the post. He deserted again in May 1872.\n\nLongley's travels for the rest of 1872 are unknown but by February 1873, he had returned to Texas, where he was accused of murdering another freedman in Bastrop County. He then returned to live with his father's family in Bell County, Texas. In the summer of that year, Mason County Sheriff, J. J. Finney, arrested Longley for murder and brought him to Austin to collect a reward. However, when the federal military reward was not forthcoming from state officials, Finney released Longley, possibly in exchange for a bribe from Longley's uncle, Alexander \"Pres\" Preston Longley of California.\n\nOn March 31, 1875, Longley shot his childhood friend, Wilson Anderson, dead with a shotgun. The murder was alleged to have been instigated by Longley's uncle, Caleb B. Longley, who had blamed Anderson for the death of his son, Cale, and urged Longley to take revenge. Longley then fled northward, accompanied by his brother, James Stockton Longley, who was later tried and acquitted of Anderson's murder. A new reward was posted for Longley's capture.\n\nUnder increasing pressure from law enforcement, Longley fled from place to place and used several aliases to avoid arrest. He briefly found work on a cotton farm, but he was forced to run again in November 1875, after murdering a hunting buddy named George Thomas with whom he had had a fistfight.\n\nLongley committed another killing in Uvalde County, Texas in January 1876, when his attempted ambush of fellow outlaw, Lou Shroyer, turned into a gunfight. Shroyer shot Longley's horse from under him, but Longley shot Shroyer dead. This is the only known case in Longley's career where one of his victims returned fire.\n\nFleeing again, Longley went to east Texas and became a sharecropper for preacher, William R. Lay. Stability eluded him again, however, when Longley became rivals with Lay's nephew for the affections of a young woman. Longley beat up his rival, was subsequently jailed, and escaped. Longley blamed Lay for his brief imprisonment. On June 13, 1876, Longley rode out to his landlord's farm, found him milking a cow, and murdered him with a shotgun. Lay would be the last man known to be killed by Longley.\n\nLongley then possibly went to Grayson County, Texas, where two of his friends, Jim and Dick Sanders, were in jail. Longley broke them out, and the trio escaped, disarming deputy Matt Shelton when he tried to arrest them. Approximately one year later, deputy Matt Shelton confirmed this encounter. Longley then fled to Louisiana.\n\nOn June 6, 1877, Longley was surrounded and arrested without incident by Nacogdoches County Sheriff, Milt Mast, and two deputies while he was residing in De Soto Parish, Louisiana under the alias \"Bill Jackson\". He was returned to Texas, tried in the Lee County Court, and sentenced to hang for the murder of Wilson Anderson. His appeal was denied in March 1878. On October 11, 1878, Longley was executed by hanging in Giddings, Texas, only a few miles from his birthplace of Evergreen. His grave and a state historical marker are in Giddings City Cemetery.\n\nHe claimed to have killed thirty-two people, mostly of Hispanic and African American heritage.\n\nYears after the execution, Longley's father, Campbell, came forward in a press release stating that his son had \"not\" been executed. He claimed that a wealthy relative in California bribed the lawmen with $4,000, prompting them to rig a trick rope. They then staged the hanging and whisked the body away. The family even came up with alleged letters said to have been written by Longley from California. The legend spread, and many believed it for quite some time.\n\nThis prompted many historians to investigate. Finally, after confirming the gravesite of Longley, an exhumation of the human remains was performed. They were taken to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D. C., where DNA tests were performed, along with a skull reconstruction. In June 2001, it was officially reported that the remains from the gravesite were indeed those of Bill Longley.\n\nNumerous myths and legends have grown up about Longley that cannot be verified by any contemporary source. Many of these legends trace back to tall tales that Longley himself told while imprisoned in Giddings in 1877. Some of these stories are probably false, while others could be true but lack any contemporary corroborating evidence. Longley's lies appear to have been motivated partly by his desire to rival John Wesley Hardin's reputation as a killer. Longley was outraged when he found he was to be put to death, while Hardin was only sentenced to twenty-five years in prison.\n\nThe most clearly false story Longley told was of being captured and lynched in 1869 alongside one of Cullen Baker's outlaw gang, surviving when a lucky shot severed the rope he had been hanged from, and then joining Baker's riders. As Baker was dead and his band dispersed at the time Longley claimed this happened, the story cannot be true.\n\nThere is no contemporaneous evidence to back claims that Longley murdered a black militiaman in Old Evergreen in 1866 for insulting his father, or that he shot eight black people in Lexington in 1867 to avenge the loss of a horse racing bet. Furthermore, Longley would have been 14 and 15 years old respectively at the time of the alleged incidents. True or false, the stories are consistent with Longley's well-established racist character; in his own words he \"was taught to believe it was right to kill sassy negroes.\"\n\nLongley's account of killing a trail boss named Rector while en route to Wyoming in 1870 is similarly of unknown veracity.\n\nTraditionally, Longley is said to have used a pair of Dance .44 revolvers; the Dance was a Texas-manufactured imitation of the Colt Dragoon. However, he used a shotgun to kill both Wilson Anderson and William Lay, his only murders for which his weapon is definitely known.\n\nLongley is a major character in \"The Pistoleer,\" a novel by James Carlos Blake (Berkley Books, NY, 1995).\n\nIn 1954, the actor Douglas Kennedy played Longley in an episode of Jim Davis's syndicated western television series, \"Stories of the Century\".\n\nIn 1958, Steve McQueen played Longley in Season 2, Episode 23 of Tales of Wells Fargo.\n\nLongley is the title character in The Texan, a television series starring Rory Calhoun which aired on CBS from 1958-1960, and portrayed Longley in an heroic role, a wanderer throughout the American West who assists those having trouble with the lawless element.\n\nLongley figures prominently in Louis L'Amour's 1959 novel \"The First Fast Draw\", a highly fictionalized version of Cullen Baker's life.\n\nTexas singer/songwriter, Houston Marchman, wrote a song about Longley, \"Bill Longley,\" which is on his second CD \"Leavin' Dallas\" (1999).\n\n\n\n"}

This media scrutiny, however, can often become a source of income for the celebrity, or the media scrutiny becomes an outlet of promotion for future manufactured publications or initiatives by the celebrities, and the media scrutiny around the celebrity expands to include coverage of such products.\n\nThe term \"celebrity-industrial complex\" is an homage to the much older term military–industrial complex, which refers to a similar bilateral relationship between national militaries and industrial corporations which profit from each other.\n\n"}

{"id": "9270248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9270248", "title": "Gilly Roach", "text": "Gilly Roach\n\nGilly Roach is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera, \"Hollyoaks\", played by Anthony Quinlan. The character debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 4 October 2005. Gilly was created in 2005 by executive producer David Hanson. Gilly has often been portrayed as a push-over and has a double act partnership with fellow character Rhys Ashworth. His main character traits have been his \"nice attitude\", with Quinlan branding Gilly in his first five years as a \"push-over\". He has been labelled a loser and unlucky in love after failed relationships with Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall), Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan), Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). In 2009, executive producer Lucy Alan made changes to the character and reached a mutual agreement with Quinlan to shave off his hair, which has characterised Gilly during his early years.\n\nIn 2010 he was paired with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), who was later killed off after Stenson quit her role. This resulted in a long-running storyline for Gilly in which he was seen taking a \"dark journey\" unable to cope with grief. Another big storyline for the character occurs in 2011 when Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) accuses him of rape; the storyline subsequently received media attention. A fictional jury consisting of viewers is to decide if he is guilty or innocent. Other storylines have involved the effects of binge drinking, which was portrayed during an online spin-off drama. Gilly has sometimes proved unpopular with television critics, with one branding him a \"dampy drizzle of a character\". Quinlan has also been nominated for minor awards for his portrayal. In 2011, it was announced that Quinlan would be leaving the serial to pursue other projects and would leave at the end of the rape storyline.\n\nBBC America described Gilly on their official website stating: \"His most endearing quality is his honesty and despite his countless flaws, what you see is what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma.\" E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.\n\nDuring a spin-off series titled \"\", Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series explored the dangers of bringe drinking and was funded by the Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: \"Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village.\"He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: \"It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do.\" When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: \"Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours.\" To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: \"I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out on the wrong side of it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much.\"\n\nGilly was later seen using his new look in attempt to get the affections of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it all off, a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen with long hair.\n\nAfter Gilly eventually starts a relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him. Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: \"With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her.\" Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with \"Inside Soap\": \"I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really he was in love with her.\" At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: \"His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring.\" Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the \"tear jerking\" scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed \"fire week\". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he \"was very manly about it\" whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: \"So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!\" Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: \"He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that.\" He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: \"I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before.\" Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: \"The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret.\" As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added \"It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode.\"\n\nGilly later finds himself attracted to Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan); he initially fears he is moving on to soon. Whilst interviewed by \"Inside Soap\" Quinlan describes the scenes in which they share their first kiss stating: \"Gilly gets a new job at Look Sharpe as a personal trainer, and invites Lynsey for a free session, Lynsey's looking pretty good when she turns up, so Gilly gets a bit sweaty and hot under the collar - and she ends up hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in fully clothed!\" They later meet up and feel awkward because of Gilly's grief for Steph, of this Quinlan adds: \"They're getting on well, but as soon as the word date is mentioned, it goes a bit wrong, nerves get the better of them and they have a huge row.\" Off-screen Quinlan was not happy with the fact Gilly is trying to move on quick, of this he states: \"I thought it was a bit harsh, it feels like it's a little too soon, doesn't it? We'll just have to wait and see what the future holds for Gilly and Lynsey - but there's no comparison to Steph...\"\n\nIn December 2010 Channel 4 released a press statement which revealed Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) would cheat on Rhys with Gilly and that the night's events would \"change their lives forever\". It was later announced that the storyline would see Jacqui accusing Gilly of raping her. The storyline received much coverage in various tabloid newspapers who also branded it as a \"shock plot\" for the serial. None of the cast members involved in the storyline knew if Jacqui had actually been raped, of this Cooper states: 'They're telling the same story but are looking at it from different angles. Just who to believe is a very grey area. It will split the village and the viewers. We don't know what happened that night, We've just been told that our characters each think they're telling the truth. [Anthony] and I have talked about it a lot. I even read his scripts to try to work it out. The outcome will be a surprise for both of us.'\n\nThe storyline began to play out on-screen in February 2011, describing how it starts to develop and the effects it has on Gilly, a spokesperson for the serial told \"Inside Soap\": \"She runs into Gilly who's also got relationship problems. The drink starts to flow, and one thing leads to another... Gilly consumed with guilt over sleeping with his best friend's girlfriend, it doesn't help that Jacqui leaves Gilly's place while he's asleep - and runs into Rhys. But after Gilly wakes up, he knows he has to tell his mate what he's done. When Gilly confesses, Rhys is both furious and hurt, and lashes out violently. [...] Once he's confronted Gilly, he demands an explanation from Jacqui - and is stunned when she tells him she was actually raped, it's absolutely devastating.\" The storyline later takes another turn when Gilly confronts Jacqui in the village with everyone watching, leading everyone to doubt if he did commit the act or not.\n\nIt was later revealed that the details were left unclear because Lime Pictures had decided to leave the outcome of the rape trial to viewers. Viewers have been given the chance to apply for the fictional jury, consisting of a cross section of society, including non-Hollyoaks viewers. They will be shown evidence from the case and then decide whether Gilly is guilty or innocent. Chief executive of \"Lime Pictures\", Carolyn Reynolds stated: \"We wanted to open up the thorny issue of how hard it is to be a juror and whether the court room is the best place to resolve some of these questions about rape.\" The storyline was developed with the \"St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre\" and other charities. DCI Ben Snuggs, leader of Don't Cross the Line campaign, explained: \"This storyline represents an issue that we see all too often, involving whether consent is clear on the part of both parties involved in sexual activity, and particularly when alcohol and drugs are involved.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Quinlan announced his departure from \"Hollyoaks\". The serial decided to write a conclusion to the rape storyline, airing in a special three-hander episode centered on Gilly, Jacqui and Rhys which featured Gilly confessing to the rape as he knew Jacqui was not consenting when he raped her.\n\nGilly is from Manchester. When the Ashworths move to Hollyoaks, Gilly decides to move with them. He sneaks into a Halloween party at HCC, Gilly kisses Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall) and assumes the role of her wannabe boyfriend. This leads to him pretending to be a philosophy student just to get close to her and finds a rival in Mark Jury (Asier Newman), Jessica's real boyfriend. The two battled for affections but Jessica could not decide between them and ended both relationships. Neville (Jim Millea) buys Drive 'n' Buy and Gilly becomes an employee, mainly so he can become close to Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley). The pair start going on dates, however, Sarah loses interest. Any chance of a relationship ends when Gilly reveals Rhys slept with her mother, Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley). Rhys becomes jealous over Gilly and Sarah and kicks him out of the home. Gilly moves into the student halls with ex-girlfriend, Jess. After Gilly defends Zak after he is accused of stealing Zoë's belongings, he and Rhys renew their friendship and he moves back into the Ashworths'. Gilly finds out Rhys is an escort and decides to be one himself, unaware the job involves nothing sexual.\n\nRhys discovers Zak and Gilly are planning a strip show at nightclub The Loft. Rhys agrees to join, however, is replaced by Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle). During the strip show, Rhys tries to chat up a girl, who is only interested in Gilly. Gilly meets a young woman named Molly Traverse (Kate Deakin), whom he is put off by when she mentions marriage. During her battle with anorexia, Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and friend, Melissa Hurst (Carla Chases), begin being horrible to Gilly. Hannah hits him, however, after returning from hospital, she apologises. After finding out his girlfriend Beth is his half-sister, Rhys begins being jealous after she and Gilly grow close. Gilly and Beth grow closer and kiss. They start a relationship and agree to take it slowly. Gilly decides to become a lifeguard. Whilst cleaning up, Gilly sees boss, Simon Crosby (Simon Lawson), leaving a cubicle with a crying child. Gilly automatically assumes he is a paedophile. Gilly breaks into Simon's house and finds pictures of children in their swimwear, one of whom is Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins). He also finds a boy's room with a lock on the door. Gilly shows various residents the proof. Angry parents begin to gather outside Simon's home and vandalise it by smashing the windows. Realsing his reputation is ruined, Simon attempts suicide. Simon's wife Gemma Grosby (Gemma Langford) shows Gilly a picture of their son, who died. Gilly realises Simon is innocent and feels guilty.\n\nGilly goes backpacking around Thailand. At this time, Beth and Rhys rekindle their romance and start an affair. Guilty, Beth leaves with Gilly and they return later in 2008. Gilly proposes to Beth, who agrees to make Rhys, who is in a relationship with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), jealous. Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) catches Rhys and Beth kissing and tells Gilly, who refuses to believe. Later, Michaela tells Gilly to go home in an attempt to make him see the truth. Gilly does so and catches Rhys and Beth sleeping together. He begins to beat up Rhys and calls the police. Realising they face a prison sentence for incest, Rhys and Beth leave Hollyoaks, however, they are involved in a car crash which results in Beth's death. After time away, Rhys returns and he and Gilly decide to make up.\n\nGilly meets Leila Roy (Lena Kaur) and the pair begin a relationship. The romance is short as Leila tells Gilly they cannot be together. Gilly is upset by the breakup. After a break of several months, Gilly returned. At the SU Bar, Gilly begins looking for a new girlfriend with Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood). A drunken Hannah then throws herself at Gilly and tries to kiss him. Gilly tells her he sees her as a sister. She then apologises. In \"Hollyoaks: The Morning After the Night Before\", Gilly goes to Manchester to party with Josh. Josh and Gilly begin a fight which ends with Gilly losing his front teeth. After returning to the village, Gilly begins to develop feelings for Steph and is jealous towards her relationship with Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best).\n\nWhilst at a boot camp trip with Steph and Fernando, Steph believes Gilly has feelings for Sarah, and is unaware his feelings are for her. During the trip, after Steph, Fernando and Gilly leave, Sarah is killed in a tragic parachute jump. Gilly writes a poem for Steph, and in it, offends Fernando. When Steph reads it she is angry at Gilly, who tells her it is Rhys who has the feelings for her. Fernando punches Rhys as Gilly convinces Steph he had nothing to do with the poem. In order to make Steph jealous, Gilly kisses Cheryl who is trying to make Calvin jealous. Despite using him, Cheryl develops true feelings for Gilly. Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson) works out that Gilly is in love with Steph. However, Gilly denies it, saying that he loves Cheryl. Cheryl catches Gilly looking at an engagement ring, which Fernando has bought for Steph. She assumes the ring is for her and tells everyone in The Dog in the Pond that she and Gilly are getting married. Gilly reluctantly goes along, not wanting to hurt her feelings. Cheryl notices the growing closeness between Gilly and Steph and confronts him. On discovering he is in love with Steph, she breaks off their engagement, at the same time Steph and Fernando break up. Gilly goes travelling with Zoe and Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst). Steph, after being told about Gilly's feelings for her, rushes after him to admit her love just as Gilly leaves. Gilly returns on 5 March with his girlfriend Jem. Steph is upset when he proposes to Jem. Steph admits her feelings to Gilly, but he decides to stay with Jem. Rhys tells Jem that Gilly still loves Steph causing them to split up. Gilly and Steph finally confess their true feelings to each other and begin a relationship.\n\nSteph is diagnosed with cervical cancer and does not tell Gilly, who later finds out from Cheryl. Gilly is angry at Steph for keeping this from him. Steph undergoes a hysterectomy to remove the cancer. However, doctors tell her and Gilly it failed. She is soon told her cancer is terminal. Gilly takes the news bad. The pair split up when Steph feels it is unfair on Gilly, but they get back together and start to plan their wedding. Gilly and Steph eventually get married beside the village river.\n\nGilly and Steph take a walk round the village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart conversation where she realises she's it is how she is going to die that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.\n\nGilly starts to date Lynsey, he initially thinks it is too soon after Steph's death. He is shocked when she finds a lump and it halts their relationship. He sleeps with Jacqui when they get drunk, she tells Rhys he sexually assaulted her. She reports him to the police and Gilly faces trial. Steph's family support Gilly however many villagers do not.\n\nDuring the trial it is shown Gilly and Jacqui remember the same events very differently.

Jacqui forgives him, and Gilly decides that he must leave the village. He confesses the rape to everyone in his life and says his goodbyes. Cheryl in particular is devastated by Gilly's abrupt departure and begs for him to stay, but he refuses. Jacqui comforts Cheryl as she sobs on the steps outside her flat, while Gilly and Rhys share one final look goodbye before he leaves the village forever.\n\nQuinlan was nominated for sexiest male at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards. He was also nominated in the category of \"Best Serial Drama Performance\" at the 2011 National Television Awards. That same year he was nominated in the category of \"Best Actor\" at the British Soap Awards. Ruth Deller of Lowculture has criticised Gilly, branding him as a poor character. Commenting on Steph's death she stated: \"No wonder that, gazing upon his face, she realised she was better off burning to death than enduring one more day staring at him.\" She praised Paul Marquess' cast cull of 2010, but stated that Gilly is \"still hanging around like that bit of dog mess you can’t get out of the grooves in your trainers.\" She also opined: \"A damp drizzle of a character, Gilly hasn’t worked as Rhys’s wide boy sidekick, hasn’t worked as a loved-up hippy, hasn’t worked as a doting husband, doesn’t work on any level.\" Also stating she wanted \"Hollyoaks\" serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle) to kill him. Colin Robertson, writing for British tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\" brands Gilly a kind-hearted type character.\n\nRoz Laws writing for the \"Sunday Mercury\" felt there was \"plenty of chemistry\" present between Gilly and Steph. Their relationship was frequently commented on by the \"Daily Mail\" Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column. She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl's rivalry over Gilly, and found it implausible that Jem and Steph would quarrel over him. When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She bemoaned the lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: \"Of course, you know that the moment she says that nothing is going to stop her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car.\"\n\n"}

He was the son of a Dutch father Pieter Jacobus Adrianus Zaalberg, Secretary at the Department of Education and Religious Affairs in the Dutch East Indies, and Indo (Eurasian) mother Susanna Elisabeth de Bie. He was married to Maria Taunay (born 1878) from 22 April 1899 up to her death in 1911. Both the Zaalberg and De Bie family were of Jewish descent. They had two sons and three daughters, one of whom died young.\n\nKarel Zaalberg was a self-taught and self-made man. With only primary school he became chief editor of one of the biggest newspapers. Education for the Indo-Europeans of the Dutch East Indies would be his life's personal and political ambition. As a journalist he became a spokesman for the Indo-European (Eurasian) community.\n\nHe was director of the first organization for Indo-Europeans in the Dutch East Indies ('Indische Bond' of 1898). After 1919 he became a founder and board member of the Indo-European Alliance (Dutch: ‘Indo Europeesch Verbond'), with over 10,000 members the largest interest group of this population. From 1924 until his death, four years later, he represented the party in the Dutch East Indies People's Council ().\n\nZaalberg was a leading figure in the political and social emancipation of the Indo (Eurasian) community of the Dutch East Indies of the late 19th and early 20th century, who had closely befriended famous figures of the time like writer P.A. Daum, E.du Perron and independence activist Ernest Douwes Dekker.\n\nDue to a traffic accident his father became disabled and the impoverished family was unable to send their children to any form of higher or even secondary education. Young Zaalberg found a simple and low-ranking job at a big newspaper (copying addresses). It is there, however, where the intelligent Zaalberg learned the ropes of journalism, as well as English and French (by translating foreign newspaper articles and telegrams).\n\nThe editor in chief P.A. Daum, who was one of the most famous writers and journalists of the time, started to notice Zaalberg's talents and gave him more and more responsibilities. Daum, an autodidact himself, soon made Zaalberg his right-hand man, taking position against the widespread discrimination regarding Indos, who were seldom admitted to the highest layers of the colonial hierarchy. After Daum fell seriously ill Zaalberg replaced him successfully, but after the passing of his mentor the newspaper did not allow Zaalberg to replace him as editor in chief. The new chief editors failed miserably and the position remained vacant for a long time. Only after threatening to quit Zaalberg was appointed Chief Editor of the 'Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad'.\n\nMeanwhile, Zaalberg had also emerged himself into politics and became a champion of the interests of the Indo Eurasians. His attention was focused on the acquisition of civil rights, including the right of political association and the right to vote, for native-born (Indo-)Europeans as well as educated Javanese and Chinese. He also published several articles on the need of education for the native population and increasing involvement in the government of the archipelago.\nThe appointment of Ernest Douwes Dekker (an Indo like Zaalberg) as deputy editor in 1907 increased the political momentum of the 'Batavian Newspaper'. It had good contacts with young Javanese intellectuals and was actively involved in the formation of ‘Boedi Oetomo’ an event which is seen as the beginning of Indonesian nationalism. The close friendship between Douwes Dekker and Zaalberg initially led to joint plans with 'Budi Utomo' to aim for a parliament representing all native communities, including the Indo Eurasians.\n\nEven though Zaalberg was opposed to the colonial policy of the Netherlands, that in his opinion seemed ignorant to the inevitable struggle for emancipation of the Indonesian peoples, Zaalberg was not a radical revolutionary. His sharp and biting criticism was always framed in a positivist worldview, in which gradual and reasonable development, also with regard to the colonial relationship, remained paramount. Unlike Dekker who in the tradition of his famous ancestor, the writer of 'Max Havelaar', did not hesitate to taunt the authorities. This is also where the radical Dekker and the moderate Zaalberg fell out and went their separate ways. Dekker went on to found the 'Indische Party' in 1912 and Zaalberg the 'Indo Europeesch Vebond' in 1919.\n\nAfter his breakup with Dekker, coinciding with a temporary decline of his journalistic career and the death of his beloved wife, his health started failing. He still however experienced his finest hour when he acted as chairman at the founding meeting of the Indo-European Alliance (Dutch: ‘Indo Europeesch Verbond') in 1919. As board member of the 'IEV' he became a representative in the Dutch East Indies 'Volksraad' (House of Assembly), an infant form of local parliament, where he remained highly vocal about the need for native educational facilities. At age 53 he succumbed to his health issues. Under the leadership of his successor Dick de Hoog his 'IEV' would become the single most important Indo movement in the Dutch East Indies, with close to 15,000 members.\n\nAlthough he is widely acknowledged as one of the great leaders driving the emancipation of the Indo community in Dutch ruled colonial society, his personal dream of building a large educated political Indo cadre that could lead the East Indies to independence was never realised. In fact in the end his biggest fear came to be. After further detrimental marginalisation the vulnerable Indo community was squashed in the inevitable clash between Dutch colonialism and the Indonesian independence movement.\n\n\n"}

In 1976 his debut novel, \"Upacara\", received second place in the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. He wrote several hundred books, both fiction and non-fiction, and served as a council member for West Kutai Regency.\n\nKorrie Layun Rampan was born in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, on 17 August 1953 to Paulus Rampan, a retired sergeant in the Indonesian Army, and Martha Renihay. He completed his elementary school studies in four years; it was during his fourth year that he first began writing, inspired to do so after reading Hamka's novel \"Tenggelamnya Kapal van der Wijck\".

He also began publishing his work in newspapers such as \"Kompas\" and \"Suara Karya\" as well as magazines such as \"Horison\".\n\nRampan married Agustina Tri Wardhani on 10 July 1973. Their marriage produced four children and they divorced in 1992. He then married Hernawati in 1992 and had two children. Hernawati passed away in 2005 and Rampan then married Hermiyana, who is Hernawati's sister, and had one child with her.\n\nIn 1976 Rampan's novel \"Upacara\" received second place in the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. Published by Pustaka Jaya two years later, the novel focuses on the rituals of a Dayak tribe in the hinterlands of Kalimantan and how they affect the life of the main character. The novel was translated into English by George A. Fowler and published by the Lontar Foundation as \"Ceremony\" in 2014.\n\nRampan worked as editor for Cypress Publishing between 1978 and 1980, then for the daily \"Sinar Harapan\" between 1980 and 1982, when he began working as editor of the magazine \"Sarinah\".\n\nDuring this time he lived in the national capital, Jakarta, occasionally serving as a broadcaster for RRI and TVRI. He also established the Arus Foundation to publish works related to literature. Rampan's poetry collection for children, \"Cuaca di atas Gunung dan Lembah\" ('The Weather above the Mountains and Valleys') won a prize from best poetry collection from the Buku Utama foundation in 1984.\n\nAfter 2001 Rampan led the \"Sentawar Pos\", a daily newspaper published in Barong Tongkok, West Kutai Regency.

He served from 2004 to 2009, spending time as the head of Commission I. During this time he remained a journalist, and would often travel between Jakarta and West Kutai for work.\n\nBy 2009 Rampan had amassed a personal collection of approximately 25,000 books, predominantly those related to literature. The oldest of these are 19th-century works of Chinese Malay literature. The books are used in his efforts to document Indonesia's literature.\n\nRampan died on 19 November 2015 at the Rumah Sakit Islam in Jakarta.

Among these products, Kutchan is most famous for manufacturing \"gosetsu-udon\", a Japanese noodle made from potato flour. Jagata-kun, the skiing potato that is the cartoon mascot of Kutchan, indicates Kutchan's two most celebrated aspects. Jagata-kun roughly translates as, \"little, fat potato boy\".\n\n\n\n\nKutchan has the distinction of being one of the snowiest towns on earth with average annual snowfalls in excess of . At only above sea level the town receives greater amounts of snow than the world's leading ski areas such as Whistler, Aspen or Chamonix. Wintry weather lasts from early November through to early April with the snowiest month being January which averages . January is also the coldest month averaging .\nKutchan has 4 very distinct seasons with reasonably short spring and autumn periods. The summer is mild with temperatures rarely getting above and the humidity that afflicts much of Asia at this time is only felt for a short period, usually in August.\n\n\nKutchan hosts the Hirafu skiing area. Hirafu is commonly mistaken as a section of Niseko town since it is a part of the greater Niseko skiing region. However, to the financial benefit of Kutchan, Hirafu lies within the confines of Kutchan town. Hirafu's largest ski resort, Niseko Grand Hirafu, draws the highest number of both domestic and foreign skiers and snowboarders than any other resort in the Niseko region. It is linked to the ski areas of Annupuri, Higashiyama, and Hanazono which together may be skied on one lift pass.\n\nIn recent years, an explosively high number of Australians have frequented Hirafu, many of whom have settled in the area and spawned businesses such as pensions, bars, and cafes.\n\nHirafu is also frequented by a considerable number of tourists from Hong Kong, as well as tourists coming from within Japan.\n\nHirafu's expanding tourism industry is often attributed to the steady and copious supply of fresh powder snow, which many claim is among the best in the entire hemisphere, if not the world.\n\nWhile Hirafu's economic boom is undoubtedly an asset to Kutchan town, many fear that such rapid development will alter the price margin of goods and services offered in the village, and subsequently transform the local flavor of Hirafu. The local community of both Japanese and foreign \"backpacker\" skiers and snowboarders, who typically operate on a smaller budget than their upscale counterparts, are already being overshadowed by the burgeoning influx of wealthy tourists.\n\nAlong with short grain white rice, much of Kutchan’s surrounding area is devoted to potato cultivation.\n\nAs the main regional center of population, Kutchan hosts a variety of cultural institutions and events. The town is home to two museums, the Kutchan Natural History Museum and the Shu Ogawara Art Museum. It also hosts the annual Mt. Niseko Kutchan Jazz Festival every July in the center of town, drawing thousands to enjoy the music of Japanese and Australian musicians.\n\n is Kutchan's mascot cartoon character. Due to the heavy snowfalls in the region, Kutchan hosts several alpine resorts frequented by domestic and international skiers and snowboarders.

He proved to be an able administrator, distinguishing himself with his capability to manage tensions with foreigners. This was demonstrated when Ma Xinyi addressed the problem of kidnapping in his area, which effectively averted anti-foreign riots, particularly in the area of the Yangzi delta. \n\nTwo years later, in 1870, Ma Xinyi was assassinated and his killer was immediately caught. The assassin was identified as Wan Qingxuan (Zhang Wenxiang), who was executed in the marketplace after a trial presided by Wan Qingxuan of Nanchang.

He was a disciple of Valentinus, with whom his system mainly agrees. His doctrines are almost exclusively known to us through a long polemic (i. 13–21) in \"Adversus Haereses\", in which Irenaeus gives an account of his teaching and his school. Clement of Alexandria clearly knew of Marcus and actually used his number system (\"Stromata\", VI, xvi), though without acknowledgement.\n\nHis system tells of 30 aeons, divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Dodecad; of the fall and recovery of Sophia; of the future union of the spirits of the chosen seed with angels as their heavenly bridegrooms. What Marcus added to the teaching of his predecessors was a system of Isopsephy similar to that of the later Pythagoreans, about mysteries in numbers and names. Marcus found in Scripture and in Nature repeated examples of the occurrence of his mystical numbers, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, thirty.\n\nMarcus appears to have been an elder contemporary of Irenaeus, who speaks of him as though still living and teaching. Though we learn from Irenaeus that the Rhone district was a home to the followers of Marcus, it does not appear that Marcus was there himself, and the impression left is that Irenaeus knew the followers of Marcus by personal intercourse, Marcus only by his writings. We are told also of Marcus having seduced the wife of one of the deacons in Asia (διάκονον τινα τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ), and the most natural conclusion is that Asia Minor was the scene where Marcus made himself a teacher, probably before Irenaeus had left that district; that it was a leading bishop there who resisted Marcus; and that his doctrines passed into Gaul by means of the extensive intercourse well known to have then prevailed between the two countries.\n\nThe use of Hebrew or Syriac names in the Marcosian school may lead us to ascribe to Marcus an Oriental origin. The only grounds, for believing him to be of Egyptian extraction are these:—Sulpicius Severus, and others who give the history of the origin of Priscillianism, tell that one Marcus of Memphis brought the Gnostic doctrines into Spain, from whom Agape and Elpidius learned them. Jerome certainly identified this Marcus with the subject of the present article, his notion bring that Marcosian doctrine, which we know from Irenaeus to have been prevalent in Southern Gaul, naturally passed on to the adjacent province of Spain. It is not quite clear whether Jerome felt the chronological difficulties of his theory, which, however, could be easily got over by supposing that the first Priscillianists were to be regarded as having learned from Marcus, not because they had been taught by himself personally, but because they had learned from men who revered him as the founder of their sect. But since Priscillianism contains none of the points which distinguish Marcus from other Gnostics, it is safer to regard Marcus, of Memphis as a distinct personage.\n\nIrenaeus alleges that Marcus abused his influence over \"silly women\" in order to gain both money and sexual favors. He is accused of having used philtres and love charms, and at least one, if not more, of his female disciples on returning to the Church confessed that body as well as mind had been defiled by him. However, it seems that most of his followers claimed to have been elevated by their knowledge and the redemption they had experienced.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19175158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19175158", "title": "Martin Luther Thompson", "text": "Martin Luther Thompson\n\nMartin Luther Thompson was a Texas Choctaw leader and rancher who along with his relatives, William Clyde Thompson (1839–1912), Robert E. Lee Thompson (1872–1959) and John Thurston Thompson (1864–1907), led several families of Choctaws from the Mount Tabor Indian Community in Rusk County, Texas to Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, I.T. (now Marlow, Oklahoma)\n\nMartin, a mixed blood Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian, was the son of Thomas Umphres Thompson (1829–1864) and Martha Strong Thompson (1836–1920) (who were first cousins) was born in Rusk County, Texas on September 20, 1857. He married Inez Monterey Fannin at Camp Colorado, Coleman County, Texas on June 22, 1876. Inez who was born on May 15, 1860 at the Mount Tabor Indian Community in Rusk County, Texas, was the daughter of William Moore Fannin (1833–1877) a mixed blood Choctaw, and Sarah Horton (1840–1928) who was also a mixed blood Indian of Choctaw, Chickasaw and Cherokee ancestry.\n\nThe couple made their homes near New London in Rusk County before relocating to the Chickasaw Nation in 1894. While living in the Chickasaw Nation, the couple lived in what is now rural Stephens County, Oklahoma near the community of Bray. Together the couple had eight children: Willie Newton (female), Althia, Decater Lee, Thomas Agatha (female), Clarence, Melissa Alavada, Cone Johnson and Mossie Brown. Martin died on August 25, 1946 in Jacksonville, Texas. He was preceded in death by his wife Inez on January 10, 1931 in Overton, Texas. Both are buried in Asbury Indian Cemetery near Troup, Texas.\n\nMartin L. Thompson, who had been chosen the leader of the Choctaws at Mount Tabor in 1885, was passed over in favor of William Clyde Thompson, to represent the Yowani Choctaw descendants in the Chickasaw Nation, in their attempt to attain citizenship by blood in the Choctaw Nation. During the period of the Dawes Commission building of a Final Roll of the Five Civilized Tribes (1895–1907), Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians could live any place they close within the two nations. The reasons for this were many, but primarily the two tribes had been one not long before European contact. They spoke the same language, with some dialectal differences, and were culturally similar. In fact shortly after removal, the two tribes were united into one group for a short period of time. Those that did relocate to Indian Territory from east Texas settled in or near the town of Marlow, Oklahoma where William C. Thompson later served as Mayor. The lands that Martin Thompson settled was between Marlow and Bray in what is now Stephens County, Oklahoma. Although listed on the Choctaw Census as a \"Choctaw Living in the Chickasaw Nation\", Martin returned to Rusk County, Texas in 1896 before the close of the Dawes Roll and was therefore not entered onto the Final Roll.\n\nFollowing his return to Texas he remained in a leadership position until his death. Although influential within the Mount Tabor Indian Community, the larger organization, the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands was led only by Cherokees both within the community and in the Cherokee Nation. Most Cherokees had left Rusk County between 1866 and 1900. While the overall leadership moved from William Penn Adair until his death in Washington, D.C. in 1880, for a period it was again centered in Texas through John Martin Thompson. With his death in 1907, the Executive Committee of the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands was shifted back to the Cherokee Nation with Claude Muskrat as Chairman. He was succeeded by W.W. Keeler who was later to serve as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nWith the resignation of Keeler in 1972 and the adoption of a constitution for the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma in 1975, the Texas Cherokee Executive Committee was again led by Texans. Judge Foster T. Bean replaced Keeler and remained in that capacity until 1988. Judge Bean was succeeded by J.C. Thompson as Chairman, serving from 1988-1998 and again from 2001-2018. J.C. Thompson being the great great nephew of Martin L. Thompson.\n\nFor Martin L. Thompson, family, ranching and oil would consume the remainder of his life. His only other claim to fame was his conflict with George Fields, attorney for the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands in the 1920s. The issue was over inclusion of the Choctaws in litigation related to the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1839. From this conflict, the word Choctaw was scratched off the documents that were to be a part of the brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in 1921.\n\nAlthough his family was not able to be listed as citizens by blood on the Final Rolls of the Choctaw Nation, his return to Texas was for the best. Oil was discovered on his land and by the time of his death he was one of the wealthiest Choctaw-Chickasaws in the United States. From this start many of his descendants went on to prosperous lives as doctors, attorneys, ranchers and teachers. His family today remains active as citizens of the Mount Tabor Indian Community with his grandson Ras Pool serving as Deputy Chairman from 2000 until his passing in 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

Her work launched a decade long campaign to improve healthcare services and awareness of cystic fibrosis in Ireland. The campaign spanned several years and became a nationwide community effort sustained by Tinsley's articles in The Irish Times about lack of facilities, the deaths of her friends and the stories and energy of people with CF and their families and communities around Ireland.\n\nIn September 2008 for her work she was named \"Rehab Young Person of the Year\" In April 2009 she appeared on \"Late Late Show\" after writing several pieces in \"The Irish Times holding government to account on broken promises to build an adult cystic fibrosis unit in Dublin.\nIn 2009 she began an internship in The Irish Times. That same year the promised government funding for the cystic fibrosis unit was pulled and the campaign reprised. Several campaigners from the previous had died. Ms Tinsley and other new campaigners featured on RTE Liveline Show which played an important role in the campaign. Tinsley was named Irish Tatler Magazine's \"Woman of the Year\" in 2009. In 2010 she was awarded the \"Young Medical Journalist of the Year\" award.\n\nIn April 2011 Ms Tinsley presented a special documentary for RTÉ's flagship current affairs programme \"Prime Time\" to apply pressure for building to begin at St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.\n\nIn September 2011 her best-selling memoir \"Salty Baby : A memoir\" was published by Hachette. It was shortlisted for Best Newcomer at the Bórd Gáis Irish Book Awards.\n\nAn Adult Cystic Fibrosis practice was set up at St. Vincent's Hospital in the late 1970s by Professor MX Fitzgerald. CF was one of the first conditions to be treated by a multidisciplinary team comprising doctors, dietitians, physiotherapists, psychologists and nurse specialists. Huge improvements in life expectancy were achieved in this period but when advances in microbial genetics revealed how highly-resistant and life-threatening bacteria could spread through the CF patient population, it became clear that a dedicated space was required to treat CF patients in isolation from one another. There was no dedicated CF ward at this time and it took years to convince those in power to build one. In July 2012, after campaign work over numerous years, a dedicated Cystic Fibrosis Unit opened. The ward block has an outpatient and inpatient facility for people with cystic fibrosis. It also has a floor of isolation rooms for people with cancer and another floor for those with infectious diseases who need isolation.\n\nSimilar units have opened in Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Limerick.\n\nSince 2012 Ms Tinsley has focused on the rights of transgender people to attain gender recognition in Ireland. She was named \"Broadcaster / Journalist of the Year by the Gay and Lesbian Association\" in 2013.\n\nIn late 2012 she launched a campaign to get Kalydeco into Ireland after experts rejected making the drug available because it was too expensive. The drug is the first to treat the cause of cystic fibrosis and not just the symptoms.\nIn February 2013 the Minister for Health announced that the drug would be made available.\n\nSince late 2013 Ms Tinsley is one of the first people in the world to be treated by the second new cystic fibrosis drug lumacaftor/ivacaftor which treats the most common mutation of CF.

He attracted foreign capital to boost Russia's industrialization. Witte served under the last two emperors of Russia, Alexander III and Nicholas II. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) he had risen to a position in which he controlled all the traffic passing to the front along the lines of the Odessa Railways. As Minister of Finance Witte presided over extensive industrialization and the management of various railroad lines. He framed the October Manifesto of 1905, and the accompanying government communication, but was not convinced it would solve Russia's problem with the Tsarist autocracy.\n\nOn 20 October 1905 he became the first Chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers (Prime Minister). Assisted by his Council he designed Russia's first constitution. Within a few months he fell into disgrace within court circles as a reformer. He resigned before the First Duma assembled. Witte was fully confident that he had resolved the main problem—providing political stability to the regime, but according to him the \"peasant problem\" would further determine the character of the Duma's activity.\n\nHe has been described as the 'great reforming finance minister of the 1890s', 'one of Nicholas's most enlightened ministers', and the architect of Russia's new parliamentary order in 1905.\n\nWitte's father Christoph Heinrich Georg Julius Witte descended from a Lutheran Baltic family of Dutch origin and converted to Russian Orthodoxy upon marriage with Yekaterina Fadeyeva. He became a member of the knighthood in Pskov, but moved to Saratov and Tiflis as a civil servant. Sergei was raised on the estate of his mother's parents. His grandfather was Andrei Mikhailovich Fadeyev, a Governor of Saratov and Privy Councillor of the Caucasus, his grandmother was Princess Helene Dolgoruki. Sergei had two brothers (Alexander and Boris) and two sisters (Olga and Sophia), and the mystic Helena Blavatsky was their first cousin. He entered a Tiflis gymnasium, but he took more interest in music, fencing and riding than in studying. Sergei finished Gymnasium I in Kishinev and commenced studying Physico-Mathematical Sciences at the Novorossiysk University in Odessa in 1866 graduating top of his class in 1870.\n\nWitte had initially planned to pursue a career in academia with the aim of becoming a professor in Theoretical Mathematics. His relatives took a dim view of this career path as it was considered unsuitable for a noble at the time. He was instead persuaded by Count Vladimir Alekseyevich Bobrinsk, then Minister of Ways and Communication, to pursue a career in the railroads. At the direction of the Count, Witte undertook six months of on the job training in a variety of positions on the Odessa Railways in order to gain a practical understanding of Ukrainian Railways operations. At the end of this period he was appointed chief of the traffic office.\n\nAfter a wreck on the Odessa Railways in late 1875 cost many lives, Witte was arrested and sentenced to four months in prison. However, while still contesting the case in court, Witte's Odessa Railways made such extraordinary efforts towards the transport of troops and war materials in the Russo-Turkish War—he devised a novel system of double-shift working to overcome delays on the line—that he attracted the attention of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, who commuted his term to two weeks.\n\nIn 1879, Witte accepted a post in St. Petersburg, where he met his future wife. He moved to Kiev the following year. In 1883, he published a paper on \"Principles of railway tariffs for cargo transportation\", in which he also spoke out on social issues and the role of the monarchy. Witte gained popularity. In 1886, he was appointed manager of the privately held Southwestern Railways, based in Kiev, and was noted for increasing its efficiency and profitability. Around this time, he met Tsar Alexander III, but came into conflict with the Tsar's aides when he warned of the danger in using two powerful freight locomotives to achieve high speeds for the Royal Train. His warnings were proven in the October 1888 Borki train disaster, which resulted in the appointment of Witte to the position of Director of State Railways.\n\nWitte worked in railroad management for twenty years, starting out as a ticket clerk. He served as Russian Director of Railway Affairs within the Finance Ministry from 1889 to 1891; and during this period, he oversaw an ambitious program of railway construction. Until then less than one-fourth of the small railway systems was under direct state control; but Witte set about making the railway service a monopoly of the State. Witte also obtained the right to assign employees based on their performance, rather than political or familial connections. In 1889, he published a paper titled \"National Savings and Friedrich List\", which cited the economic theories of Friedrich List and justified the need for a strong domestic industry, protected from foreign competition by customs barriers. This resulted in a new customs law for Russia in 1891, which spurred an increase in industrialization in Russia towards the turn of the century.\n\nTsar Alexander III appointed him acting Minister of Ways and Communications in 1892. This gave him control of the railroads in Russia and the authority to impose a reform on the tariffs charged. \"Russian railroads gradually became perhaps the most economically operated railroads of the world.\". Profits were high: over 100 million gold rubles a year to the government (exact amount unknown due to accounting defects). In 1892 Witte became acquainted with Matilda Ivanovna (Isaakovna) Lisanevich in a theater. Witte began to seek her favour, urging her to divorce her gambling husband and marry him. The marriage was a scandal, not only because Matilda was a divorcee, but also because she was a converted Jew. It cost Witte many of his connections with the upper nobility, but the Tsar protected him.\n\nIn August 1892, Witte was appointed to the post of Minister of Finance, a post which he held for the next eleven years. (Until 1905 matters pertaining to industry and commerce were within the province of the Ministry of Finances.) During his tenure, he greatly accelerated the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. He also paid much attention to the creation of an educational system to train personnel for industry, in particular, the creation of new \"commercial\" schools, and was known for his appointment of subordinates by their academic credentials instead of political connections. In 1894, he concluded a 10-year commercial treaty with the German Empire on favorable terms for Russia. When Alexander III died, he told his son on his deathbed to listen well to Witte, his most capable minister. In 1895, Witte established a state monopoly on alcohol, which became a major source of revenue for the Russian government. In 1896, he concluded the Li–Lobanov Treaty with Li Hongzhang of the Qing dynasty. One of the rights secured for Russia was the construction of the China Eastern Railway across northeast China, which greatly shortened the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway to its projected eastern terminus at Vladivostok. However, following the Triple Intervention, Witte strongly opposed the Russian occupation of Liaodong Peninsula and the construction of the naval base at Port Arthur in the Russia–Qing Convention of 1898.\n\nIn 1896, Witte undertook a major currency reform to place the Russian ruble on the gold standard. This led to increased investment activity and an increase in the inflow of foreign capital. Witte also enacted a law limiting working hours in enterprises in 1897, and reformed commercial and industrial taxes in 1898. In summer 1898 he addressed a memorandum to the Tsar calling for an agricultural conference on the reform of the peasant community. This resulted in three years of talks about laws abolishing collective responsibility, and facilitated the resettlement of farmers onto lands on the outskirts of the Empire. Many of his ideas were later adopted by Pyotr Stolypin. In 1902 Witte's supporter the Minister of Interior Dmitry Sipyagin was assassinated. In an attempt to keep up the modernization of the Russian economy Witte called and oversaw the Special Conference on the Needs of the Rural Industry. This conference was to provide recommendations for future reforms and the data to justify those reforms. By 1900 the growth in manufacturing industry had been four times faster than in the preceding five-year period and six times faster than in the decade before that. External trade in industrial goods was equal to that of Belgium. In 1904 the Union of Liberation was formed demanding economic and political reform.\n\nWitte, in a memorandum, tried to turn the reports of the zemstvo presidents into a condemnation of the Ministry of the Interior. In a conflict on land reform Vyacheslav von Plehve accused him being part of a Jewish-masonic conspiracy. According to Vasily Gurko Witte had dominated the irresolute Tsar and this was the moment to get rid of him. Witte was appointed on 16 August 1903 (O.S.) as chairman of the Committee of Ministers, a position he held until October 1905. While officially a promotion, the post had no real power, and Witte's removal from the influential post of Minister of Finance was engineered under the pressure from the landed gentry and his political enemies within the government and at the court. However, Nicholas V. Riasanovsky states that Witte's opposition to Russian designs on Korea caused him to resign from government in 1903.\n\nWitte was brought back into the governmental decision-making process to help deal with the civil unrest. Confronted with growing opposition and after consulting with Witte and Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky, the Tsar issued a reform ukase on December 25, 1904 with vague promises. After Bloody Sunday riots of 1905 Witte supplied 500 Rubles, the equivalent of 250 dollars, to Father Gapon in order to leave the country. Witte recommended that a manifesto be issued. Schemes of reform would be elaborated by Goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstva and municipal councils under the presidency of Witte. On 3 March the Tsar condemned the revolutionaries. The government issued a strongly worded prohibition of any further agitation in favor of a constitution. By spring a new political system was beginning to form in Russia. A petition campaign with a wide variety of proposed changes, like ending the war lasted from February to July 1905. In June mutiny broke out on the Russian battleship Potemkin.\n\nWitte returned to the forefront when he was called upon by the Tsar to negotiate an end to the Russo-Japanese War. He was sent as the Russian Emperor's plenipotentiary and titled \"his Secretary of State and President of the Committee of Ministers of the Emperor of Russia\" along with Baron Roman Rosen, Master of the Imperial Court of Russia to the United States, where the peace talks were being held.\n\nWitte is credited with negotiating brilliantly on Russia's behalf during the Treaty of Portsmouth negotiations. Russia lost little in the final settlement. For his efforts, Witte was created a Count. But the loss of the war would perhaps spell the beginning of the end of Imperial Russia.\n\nAfter this diplomatic success, Witte wrote to the Tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home. Dissatisfaction with the proposals by Bulygin, the successor of Sviatopolk-Mirsky on 6 August (O.S.) creating a Duma as a consultative body only; the elections would not be direct but would be held in four stages, and qualifications on class and property would exclude much of the intelligentsia and all of the working classes from suffrage, resulted in numerous protests, and strikes across the country. During the Russian Revolution of 1905 troops were sent out 2,000 times. The Tsar remained quiet, impassive and indulgent; he spent most of that autumn hunting. Witte told Nicholas II, \"that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution\". Trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity. According to Orlando Figes the Tsar asked his uncle Grand Duke Nicholas to assume the role of dictator. \"But the Grand Duke ... took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the Tsar refused to endorse Witte's memorandum.\" Nicholas II had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction. The Tsar accepted the draft, hurriedly outlined by Aleksei D. Obolensky. known as the October Manifesto. This promised to grant civil liberties such as freedom of conscience, speech, freedom of association, constitutional order, representative government and the establishment of an Imperial Duma. As the Duma was only a consultative body, the Council of Ministers or the Tsar had the right to block certain proposals,and many Russians felt that this reform did not go far enough; nothing on universal suffrage.\n\nThe regime's usual 'incompetence and obstinacy' in response to the crisis of 1904–5 was by Witte called a 'mixture of cowardice, blindness and stupidity'.\n\nWitte and Sviatopolk-Mirsky were approached the 8th of January 1905 by a delegation of intellectuals led by Maxim Gorky, who begged them to negotiate with the demonstrators, as they — after the postings of warnings of 'resolute measures' against street gatherings led by Father Gapon, on 7 January — sensed the coming tragedy. They were unsuccessful as the government believed they could control Gapon. Leaving behind visiting cards to Witte and Mirsky, Gorky was arrested with the other members of the deputations. Father Gapon would in 1906 return to Russia from exile and support Witte's government. On 30 April Witte proposed the Law of Religious Toleration in 1905, followed by the edict of 30 October 1906 giving legal status to schismatics and sectarians of the ROC. Witte argued that ending discrimination against religious rivals of the Orthodox Church 'would not harm the church, provided it embraced the reforms that would revive its religious life'. Although the Church's 'senior hierarchs' may for some time have played with the thought of self-government, Witte's demand that this would come at the cost of religious toleration 'guaranteed to drive them back into the arms of reaction'. Witte had made this demand (self-government for religious toleration) in the hope of 'wooing' the important commercial groups of the Jewish and Old-Believer communities.\n\nWitte was approached by the Tsar's advisers, in an effort to save the country from complete collapse, and on 9 October 1905 Witte arrived to be met at the Winter Palace. Here he told 'with brutal frankness' the Tsar that the country was on the verge of a catastrophic revolution, which he said 'would sweep away a thousand years of history'. He presented the Tsar with two choices: either appoint a military dictator, or agree to broad and major reforms. In a memorandum arguing for a manifesto, Witte outlined the reforms needed to appease the masses, and this he brought with him to the Tsar. The reforms he presented were the creation of a legislative parliament (Imperial Duma) elected via a democratic franchise; granting of civil liberties; a cabinet government; and a 'constitutional order'. These demands, which basically was the political programme of the Liberation Movement, was an attempt to isolate the political Left by pacifying the liberals. He also emphasised that repression only would be a temporary solution to the problem, and a risky one, because he believed the armed forces — whose loyalty was now in question — could collapse if they were to be used against the masses. Most of the military advisers to the Tsar agreed with Witte, along with Governor of St. Petersburg Alexander Trepov, who wielded a considerable influence at court. Only when Nicholas II's uncle Grand Duke Nikolai threatened to shoot himself if he did not agree to Witte's demands, following the Tsar's request of him taking position of dictator, the Tsar agreed. This would be a large source of embarrassment for the Tsar, that a former 'railway clerk', a bureaucrat and 'businessman' forced the Tsar to relinquish his autocratic rule. Witte himself would later claim that the Tsar's court only were ready to use the Manifesto as a temporary concession, and later return to autocracy when the revolutionary tide subsided'.\n\nWitte was in October charged with the task of assembling the nation's first cabinet government, and he offered the liberals several portfolios (Ministry of Agriculture to Ivan Shipov; Ministry of Trade and Industry to Alexander Guchkov; Ministry of Justice to Anatoly Koni and the Ministry of Education to Evgenii Troubetzkoy. Pavel Milyukov and Prince Georgy Lvov were also offered ministerial posts. None of these liberals agreed to join the government though, and Witte's cabinet had to be made of 'tsarist bureaucrats and appointees lacking public confidence'. The Kadets doubted that Witte could deliver on the promises made by the Tsar in October, knowing the Tsar's staunch opposition to reform.\n\nWitte argued that the Tsarist regime only could be saved from a revolution by the transformation of Russia to a 'modern industrial society', in which 'personal and public initiatives' were encouraged by a rechtsstaat who guaranteed civil liberties.\n\nIn the two weeks following the October Manifesto, several pogroms followed. Witte ordered an official investigation, where it was revealed that the police organised, armed and gave the antisemitic crowds vodka, and even contributed in the attacks. Witte demanded the prosecution of the chief of police in St. Petersburg, who was involved in the printing of agitating antisemitic pamphlets, but the Tsar intervened and protected him. Witte believed that antisemitism was 'considered fashionable' among the elite. Witte had once commented in the aftermath of the Kishinev pogrom in 1903, admitting that if Jews 'comprise about fifty percent of the membership in the revolutionary parties', it was 'the fault of our government. The Jews are too oppressed'.\n\nMilyukov once confronted Witte, asking why he would not commit himself to a constitution; to this Witte replied that he couldn't 'because the Tsar does not wish it'. Witte himself was worried that the court were only using him, which emerged in talks with members of the Kadet Party.\n\nAfter his skillful diplomacy Witte was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the equivalent of Prime Minister, and formed Sergei Witte's Cabinet, not belonging to any party, as there were none. No longer was the Tsar the head of the government. \"Immediately upon my nomination as President of the Imperial Council I made it clear that the Procurator of the Most Holy Synod Konstantin Pobedonostsev, could not remain in office, for he definitely represented the past\" and was replaced by Obolensky. Trepov and Bulygin were dismissed and after many discussions Durnovo became Minister of Interior on 1 January; his appointment seems one of the greatest errors Witte made during his administration. According to Harold Williams: \"That government was almost paralyzed from the beginning. Witte acted immediately by urging the release of political prisoners and the lifting of censorship laws.\" Alexander Guchkov and Dmitry Shipov refused to work with the reactionary Durnovo and to support the government. On 26 October (O.S.) the Tsar appointed Trepov Master of the Palace without consulting Witte, and had daily contact with the Emperor; his influence at court was paramount. \"In addition mass violence broke out in the days following the issuance of the October Manifesto. The major source of the unrest was unrelated to the October Manifesto. It took the form of attacks by gangs in the cities on the Jews. In general the authorities ignored the attacks. On 8 November the sailors in Kronstadt mutinied. In the same month the border provinces were clearly taking advantage of the weakening of Central Russia to show their teeth: On 10 November Russian Poland was placed under martial law.\n\nWitte's position was not established. The Liberals remained obdurate and refused to be cajoled. The Peasants' Union asked the Russian people not make redemption payments to the government and withdraw their deposits from bank that might be subject to government action. He promised an eight hour working day and tried to secure vital loans from France to keep the \"regime\" from bankruptcy. Witte send his envoy to the Rothschild bank; \"they would willingly render full assistance to the loan, but that they would not be in a position to do so until the Russian Government had enacted legal measures tending to improve the conditions of the Jews in Russia. As I deemed it beneath our dignity to connect the solution of our Jewish question with the loan, I decided to give up my intention of securing the participation of the Rothschilds.\" On 24 November by Imperial decree provisional regulations on the censorship of magazines and newspaper was released.\n\nOn 16 December Trotsky and the rest of the executive committee of the St. Petersburg Soviet were arrested. The Minister of Agriculture Nikolai Kutler resigned in February 1906; Witte refused to appoint Alexander Krivoshein. In the next few weeks changes and additions to the fundamental laws were made, so that the Emperor was confirmed as the dictator of foreign policies and the supreme commander of the army and navy; the ministers remained responsible solely to Nicholas II, not to the Duma. The \"peasant question\" or land reforms was a hot issue; the influence of the \"Duma of Public Anger\" had to be limited according to Goremykin and Dmitri Trepov. The Bolsheviks boycotted the coming election. When Witte discovered that Nicholas never intended to honour these concessions he resigned as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The position and influence of General Trepov, Grand Duke Nicholas, the Black Hundreds and overwhelming victories by the Kadets in the Russian legislative election, 1906, forced Witte on 14th to resign, which was announced 22 April 1906 (O.S.).\n\nWitte confessed to Polovtsov in April 1906 that the success of the repressions in the wake of the Moscow uprising in 1905 had made Witte lose all influence over the Tsar, and despite Witte's protests, Durnovo was allowed to 'carry out a brutal and excessive, and often totally unjustified, series of repressive measures.'\n\nWitte continued in Russian politics as a member of the State Council but never again obtained an administrative role in the government. He was ostracized from the Russian establishment. In January 1907 a bomb was found planted in his home. The investigator Pavel Alexandrovich Alexandrov proved that the Okhrana, the tsarist secret police, had been involved. During the winter season Witte lived in Biarritz and started his Memoirs, but he returned to St Petersburg in 1908.\n\nDuring the July Crisis in 1914, Grigori Rasputin and Witte desperately urged the Tsar not to enter the conflict and warned that Europe faced calamity if Russia became involved. The advice went unheeded; the French ambassador Maurice Paléologue complained to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sazonov. Witte died shortly afterwards due to Meningitis or a brain tumor at his home in St. Petersburg. His third class funeral was held at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. Witte had no children, but he adopted his wife's. According to Edvard Radzinsky Witte wished the title of count to be given to his grandson L.K. Naryshkin. Nothing is known about him.\n\nWitte's reputation was burnished in the West when his secret memoirs were published in 1921. They had been completed in 1912 and kept in a bank in Bayonne, not destined to be published while he and his contemporaries were alive. The original text of these memoirs are held in Columbia University Library's Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European History and Culture.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He began graduate study with James M. Robinson, who took Emmel with him to Cairo, Egypt, in 1974 as a research assistant in the international project to publish the Coptic Gnostic texts of the Nag Hammadi Codices. Emmel lived in Egypt 1974–77 in order to complete the conservation of the Nag Hammadi papyri in the Coptic Museum and to assist in the publication of both a facsimile edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices and an English-language edition and translation of the texts contained in them. During those years he traveled several times to Jerusalem to meet with the Egyptologist and linguist H. J. Polotsky in order to deepen his knowledge of Coptic grammar.\n\nIn 1978 Emmel resumed his graduate study, now with Bentley Layton at Yale University, where in 1980 he discovered a part of Nag Hammadi Codex III in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, which had acquired the previously unidentified fragment in 1964 among a group of miscellaneous papyri. Emmel’s first major publication was an edition of the Nag Hammadi text “The Dialogue of the Saviour” (1984). At about that same time, he became the first scholar to see the now famous Gnostic scripture titled “The Gospel of Judas,” in what is now called the Codex Tchacos, when it was offered for sale in 1983 in Geneva, Switzerland. However, in the short time allowed, Emmel did not see the title “The Gospel of Judas” in the papyrus manuscript and so was not the first person to identify the text as such. Nevertheless, when the National Geographic Society was considering a project to fund the conservation and publication of the Codex Tchacos in 2004, Emmel was asked to join its “Codex Advisory Panel,” and he also appeared in the society’s much publicized documentary about the Gospel of Judas project.\n\nEmmel earned his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1993 (department of religious studies, program in the study of ancient Christianity). His doctoral dissertation, “Shenoute’s Literary Corpus” (published in 2004), laid the groundwork for his current main research preoccupation, which is an international collaborative project to publish the writings of the ancient Coptic monastic leader Shenoute the Archimandrite (ca. 347–465). In 1996 Emmel was appointed professor of Coptology at the Institute of Egyptology and Coptology at the University of Münster in Germany. During the academic year 2010–11 he was on leave of absence from the University of Münster in order to serve as the first full-time professor of Coptology at the American University in Cairo.\n\nIn 1976 Emmel became a charter member of the International Association for Coptic Studies, whose first international congress (Cairo, December 1976) he helped to organize; between 1996 and 2000 he served as the association’s president, and since 2000 he has been its secretary. He was a founding editor of the \"Journal of Coptic Studies\" (Leuven: Peeters, 1988–2001 with Gerald M. Browne), and he has helped to edit several scientific monograph series.\n\nEmmel began singing and playing piano and guitar in his youth and has maintained music-making as a hobby. An acquaintanceship with David Tibet via a common interest in the Coptic language (Tibet has an M.A. in Coptic studies from Macquarie University) resulted in Emmel performing on stage with Tibet’s band Current 93 several times during 2007–10. A part of one of those performances was recorded and released in 2008.\n\n"}

Initially MDCS was primarily applied to study of molecular systems, but the Cundiff research group pioneered its application to atomic vapors and semiconductor nanostructures. \n\nIn the Cundiff group's study of atomic vapors using MDCS, notable results include direct detection of doubly-excited states induced by dipole-dipole interactions and an advance, via acquisition of three-dimensional spectra, towards complete characterization of the atomic vapor Hamiltonian.\n\nA main focus of Cundiff has been the application of MDCS to spectroscopy of semiconductor nanostructures, and his group has achieved several milestones. In quantum well nanostructures, MDCS was applied towards elucidating exciton many-body interactions. In epitaxial quantum dots, MDCS enabled coherent control of the exciton population in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening.
