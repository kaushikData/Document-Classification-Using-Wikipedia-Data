{"id": "11526353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11526353", "title": "Adam Kokesh", "text": "Adam Kokesh\n\nAdam Charles Kokesh (born February 1, 1982) is an American Libertarian and anti-war political activist who has announced plans to run for President in 2020 on the platform of an \"orderly dissolution of the federal government.\"\n\nKokesh was born on February 1, 1982, in San Francisco, California. He attended Stevenson School, an elite boarding school in Pebble Beach, for his first year of high school before attending the Native American Preparatory School in San Miguel County, New Mexico and received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Claremont McKenna College. Kokesh learned Arabic during his tenure in Iraq.\n\nIn February 2007, he became an active participant in the Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW). On March 19, 2007, to mark the 4th anniversary of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Kokesh and 12 other IVAW members participated in an occupation-like mock patrol of Washington, D.C. Kokesh first came to national attention after he was interviewed on CNN and his photograph appeared in various newspapers, including the front page of the \"Los Angeles Times\" at a protest during Alberto Gonzales's testimony to Congress regarding the dismissal of U.S. attorneys. Kokesh, wearing his Marine Corps Boonie hat, held up a sign counting the number of times Gonzalez said \"I don't remember\" or \"I don't recall\" (Kokesh claimed Gonzalez used such phrases 74 times).\n\nIn April 2007, Kokesh and a number of other activists were arrested for protesting the Iraq war in the Senate Hart Office Building. Kokesh had performed a ceremony for lost service members using an American flag.\n\nIn June 2007, Kokesh, along with IVAW members Liam Madden and Nate Lewis, was arrested for crossing onto Fort Benning during an anti-war protest. A spokesperson for the IVAW said the three had accidentally stepped onto the base while talking to a guard. The trespass charges were dismissed.\n\nKokesh enrolled in graduate studies in political management at George Washington University. In October 2007, Kokesh, along with six other students, created controversy by putting up mock political posters across the university campus to mock what they called the Islamophobic racist \"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week\" being observed at the campus. The event was organized by a conservative student organization, and invited speaker David Horowitz on the George Washington University campus.\n\nOn July 12, 2008, Kokesh spoke at the Revolution March, which took place on the west lawn of the Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn September 2, 2008, Kokesh spoke at Ron Paul's Rally for the Republic in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nOn September 4, 2008, Kokesh interrupted Senator John McCain's acceptance speech of the GOP nomination for president at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Holding a sign reading \"McCain Votes Against Vets\" on one side and \"You can't win an occupation\" on the other, Kokesh yelled, \"Ask him why he votes against vets!\" Kokesh was detained by local police and released soon after.\n\nOn October 15, 2009 Kokesh filed with the FEC to run for the U.S. House of Representatives from New Mexico's 3rd congressional district as a Republican. He eventually lost the nomination to businessman Tom Mullins, who went on to lose the November general election to incumbent Democrat Ben Ray Luján.\n\nOn May 28 Kokesh and other activists participated in a flash mob-silent dance at the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. in protest of a recent ruling against dancing in the monument. Kokesh, along with four others including Medea Benjamin of Code Pink, was arrested by the U.S. Park Police for demonstrating without a permit. Kokesh was told he was under arrest after dancing a jig. He refused officers orders and was subsequently body-slammed onto the marble floor and put in a choke hold, then cuffed. The aggressive nature of the arrests raised concerns about the actions of some of the officers and prompted an internal investigation by the Park Police. A much larger protest on June 4 organized by Kokesh and Code Pink involved about 200 protesters and 75 dancers. About 10 minutes after the dancing began, police began clearing the monument. No arrests were made. When asked by a journalist if he had a permit to protest, Kokesh reportedly produced a copy of the Constitution and said, \"Actually I got a permit. It's the same one I swore an oath to when I enlisted in the Marine Corps. And it says something about 'freedom of assembly.'\"\n\nOn February 20, 2012, after a \"Veterans for Ron Paul\" rally organized by Kokesh, 500 marchers, including veterans, active-duty service, and their families, marched towards the White House. There they engaged in ceremonial flag-folding in memory of deceased soldiers and periods of silence for soldiers who died in battle and for those who committed suicide after returning.\n\nIn May, Kokesh announced an \"Open Carry March on Washington\" where thousands of marchers bearing arms would cross from Virginia into Washington, D.C. on Independence Day to protest strict gun laws. He described the event as a nonviolent demonstration to be coordinated with DC law enforcement and that marchers should respond \"with Satyagraha\" and peacefully turn back if met with force, and should be prepared to \"submit to arrest without resisting.\"\n\nOn May 18, Kokesh, along with other protesters, was arrested in Philadelphia by U.S. National Park Service Rangers at the fifth iteration of a marijuana legalization rally known as Smoke Down Prohibition. Kokesh and Philadelphia marijuana advocate N.A. Poe appeared before United States magistrate judge Thomas J. Rueter on Monday May 20 and were charged with assaulting a federal officer and resisting arrest. The day before his May 24 release, Kokesh penned a press release calling for a \"Final American Revolution\" to take place on July 4 in place of the previously planned armed march on Washington D.C. This was to be \"A new American revolution\" where \"the American Revolutionary Army will march on each state capital to demand that the governors of these 50 states immediately initiate the process of an orderly dissolution of the federal government through secession and reclamation of federally held property.\"\n\nOn July 4, Kokesh posted a YouTube video of himself allegedly loading a shotgun in Freedom Plaza in the District of Columbia in open defiance of DC law. In the 23-second video shot early that morning and titled \"Open Carry March on DC a Success,\" as the Capitol looms in the distance, Kokesh loads the shotgun while addressing the camera. Police indicated they believed he may have used a green screen and on his return to the plaza on July 8 he insisted data from government surveillance cameras in Freedom Plaza would show he was there. \"I was here, and I loaded a shotgun on Independence Day, but I didn't kill anybody. I didn't drone any children. I didn't steal any children's future. I didn't sell this country into debt. I didn't do any of the crimes that the man two blocks over at the White House is responsible for,\" he told the reporter. \"I was ready to stand by my word, and I was ready to commit the civil disobedience that I had committed to,\" he said. \"Now that we have a year, now that we're doing something that's much more open-sourced, we're going to be marching again next Independence Day.\"\n\nOn the evening of July 9, a U.S. Park Police SWAT team raided Kokesh's house in Herndon, Virginia, executing a search warrant for the shotgun and raw footage from the July 4 video. With helicopters providing air support, the police officers knocked then kicked in the door and lobbed a flash grenade in the foyer, filling the house with smoke. Police clad in body armor stormed in and handcuffed Kokesh and his housemates, who alleged mistreatment during the raid and the ensuing five-hour search, which allegedly turned up the shotgun and Psilocybin mushrooms. Kokesh was charged with possession of Schedule I or II drugs and possession of a gun with Schedule I or II drugs, both felonies. Kokesh refused to leave his cell to be arraigned and fingerprinted, but was arraigned by a judge in his cell the next day. A statement posted on Kokesh's website read, \"We will continue to spread the message of liberty, self-ownership and the non-aggression principle regardless of the government’s relentless attacks on our operation.\" In a jailhouse interview on July 18 Kokesh denied any connection to the drugs found in the raid, implying they were planted. He claimed that the Park Police have a vendetta against him, and, when asked if he knew that what he did in the July 4 video was illegal, he responded, \"It's called civil disobedience.\"\n\nIn a jailhouse interview with Fox 5 DC, Kokesh announced his plans to run for President of the United States in 2020 on a platform of an orderly dissolution of the U.S. Federal Government.\n\nOn July 26, Kokesh posted bail in Virginia and was immediately rearrested by U.S. Park Police for breaking a D.C. law forbidding bearing arms which carries a penalty of up to five years in jail, in connection with his Freedom Plaza video. Magistrate Judge Lori Parker ordered Kokesh to remain in the D.C. jail over the weekend because, she said, he had violated the rules of his release in another case. Specifically, she noted that in June 2013, Kokesh was charged with possession of marijuana after he was arrested on the south side of the White House allegedly smoking a marijuana cigarette. On July 29 D.C. Superior Court Judge Frederick Sullivan, calling Kokesh \"a very dangerous man,\" ordered him to remain in D.C. jail until trial.\n\nOn November 6, Kokesh was released from jail after waiving his right to a trial and pleading guilty to the July 4 weapons charges and a marijuana possession charge from the June 8 White House protest.\n\nOn January 17, 2014, Kokesh was sentenced to two years of probation. At his sentencing he apologized for his actions but defended his right to protest. He told the judge he was not a violent person, but just wanted to make a statement. \"The only time I was violent was when I was a Marine.\"\n\nOn June 12, Kokesh, after entering an Alford plea in Circuit Court to two felonies related to his possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms while possessing a gun, was convicted of drug and gun charges. Although he did not contest the charges, he called the raid that led to his arrest \"political persecution.\" Kokesh received a suspended sentence.\n\nKokesh embarked on the \"For the Love of FREEDOM!\" tour in August 2016. The tour, featuring over 60 stops and including all of the 48 contiguous states, served as an exploratory tour for his 2020 Presidential run. Free copies of his book, \"FREEDOM!\", were given away to all in attendance at each event.\n\nIn April 2017, Kokesh had organized a demonstration in front of the White House as a protest against the Syrian bombing campaign, but before it could start Kokesh was arrested on an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court on charges related to him disrupting a TSA security line in Maryland in 2015.\n\nOn January 16, 2018, Kokesh announced his candidacy for President. He was pulled over by Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers twice that day and arrested the second time on marijuana and controlled substance charges. He was bailed out on January 25.\n\nWhile in jail after his 2013 arrest stemming from his Freedom Plaza civil disobedience, Kokesh began work on his book, \"FREEDOM!\"\n\nKokesh views government as the greatest cause of violence in the world today and believes that governmental coercion is just as undesirable as coercion performed by a private citizen. He believes that government should be abolished in order to reduce violence and build a society based on respect. He has announced plans to run for President of the United States in 2020 on the platform of an orderly dissolution of the federal government.\n\nKokesh is an advocate for self-ownership, the idea that each person owns himself. He believes that any act of violence or threat of violence between individuals represents a violation of someone's freedom.\n\nKokesh believes that taxation is theft.\n\nKokesh supports a non-interventionist foreign policy.\n\nKokesh is against abortion but believes that government should have nothing to do with it. He also believes, while he doesn't care for titles, that life begins at conception.\n\n\"Adam vs. The Man\" was a talk show which was available in a variety of formats, such as AM radio, web-access, podcast and Facebook-linked YouTube channel. Initially airing in 2011 as an evening two-hour broadcast on KIVA AM 1550 talk radio in Albuquerque, New Mexico, \"Adam vs. The Man\" then shifted to a half-hour video news format on RT before fully moving to the internet as an hour-long video podcast. On April 7, 2014, AVTM 4.0 was launched from Los Angeles, CA, and could be viewed live daily from noon to 2 PM, Pacific Time.\n\n\"Adam vs. The Man\" was licensed by Russia Today's US affiliate in April 2011. The move was criticized by Accuracy in Media's columnist Cliff Kincaid who referenced his own column entry from 2008 discussing RT's coverage of the Russia–Georgian War in which he condemned RT for \"preferring to use foreigners, especially Americans, to make Russian propaganda points\" before stating that \"the American Marine Veteran, Adam Kokesh, seems to fit the bill, having emerged as an anti-war activist who ran as a Republican for Congress and supported Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) for president\". \"Slate\" writer David Weigel quoted Kokesh describing RT's model, saying: \"Truth is the best propaganda. I love it! I really love the concept of that. It's funny: People say we're hiding shit as a network. No, no—we put the fact that this is propaganda right out front. We're putting out the truth that no one else wants to say. I mean, if you want to put it in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit.\"\n\nAfter only a few months on RT, \"Adam vs. The Man\" was canceled in August by that network to avoid potential legal problems stemming from an FEC complaint filed against RT by the group America’s Survival, Inc. over the matter of Kokesh endorsing Ron Paul for President (thereby allegedly running afoul of the Foreign Agents Registration Act).\n\nKokesh appears in the role of \"A Soldier\" in the 2016 film \"The Prey\", and as himself in the documentaries \"The Road to Fallujah\" (2008), \"For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty\" (2009), \"Owned & Operated\" (2012), \"Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree\" (2012), \"ShadowRing\" (2015), and \"Gray State: The Rise\" (2015).\n\nOn January 19, 2013, Kokesh appeared as a future version of himself at an anti-war-debt rally scene in the 2014 sci-fi thriller, \"Alongside Night\". Kokesh wrote the speech he delivered, a tribute to the character of Dr. Martin Vreeland (played by Kevin Sorbo), in the background during an action sequence. Most of the speech plays during the movie's end credits and the unedited full speech is on YouTube.\n\n"}

He was the second son of Chuban Manzhikov. His uncle, Roman Manzhikov, was the Baksha of the khurul in his native aimak. Following his uncle's path, Arkad Chubanov became a mandji (novice) at the age of 9, serving until the age of 13 in 1853. He then furthered his studies of Buddhism under the guidance of Lama Djimba Gandjinov and then in the Bolshederbotovskii ulus under Lama Sandji Yavanov, the Ochir Lama.\n\nAfter he completed his studies in 1872, Arkad Chubanov returned home to become a monk in his native khurul. He remained in that position until 1873, when he was elected to replace Koti Badjuginov as \"Lama of the Don Kalmyks\" - the spiritual leader of the Kalmyk community in the Salsk District of the Don Cossack Host.\n\nUpon becoming the Lama of the Don Kalmyks, Arkad Chubanov promoted education among Buzava (or Don Kalmyk) youth. In his native Namrovskaia sotnia, for example, Arkad Chubanov established a parish school - the first official school for Buzava youth in the Salsk District and perhaps the first school for Kalmyk boys in general. Arkad Chubanov also compiled and published the Kalmyk lunar calendar.\n\nArkad Chubanov died in 1894 after serving 21 years as Lama of the Don Kalmyks.

{"id": "44002461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44002461", "title": "Arron Banks", "text": "Arron Banks\n\nArron Fraser Andrew Banks (born March 1966) is a British businessman and political donor. He is the co-founder (with Richard Tice) of the Leave.EU campaign and is currently the subject of a criminal investigation by the National Crime Agency. Banks has said that the allegations against him are \"ludicrous\" and he is only facing investigation by the NCA because of \"intense political pressure from anti-Brexit supporters\".\n\nBanks was one of the largest donors to the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and bankrolled Nigel Farage’s campaign to leave the EU. A British parliamentary committee report concluded; \"Arron Banks is believed to have donated £8.4m to the Leave campaign, the largest political donation in British politics, but it is unclear from where he obtained that amount of money\"; \"He failed to satisfy us that his own donations had, in fact, come from sources within the UK.\" He has been reported to have had multiple meetings with Russian embassy officials as well as offered business opportunities in Russia in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. \n\nHe claimed he was suspended from UKIP in March 2017, but UKIP said his membership had \"lapsed earlier in the year\".\n\nBanks was raised by his mother in Basingstoke, Hampshire; his father worked as a sugar plantation manager in various African countries. From the age of 13 he attended a boarding school in Berkshire called Crookham Court, before being expelled for \"an accumulation of offences\", including the sale of lead stolen from the roofs of school buildings, and \"high-spirited bad behaviour\". He then attended St Bartholomew's School in Newbury but was expelled again. Returning to Basingstoke, where he sold paintings, vacuum cleaners, and then houses, when aged 21 he married his first wife, Caroline, with whom he has two daughters.\n\nBanks' first marriage lasted ten years and in 2001 he married Russian Ekaterina Paderina, the mother of three more children. Paderina is reported to have received help to remain in the UK from Mike Hancock while he was an MP.\n\nIn 2014, Banks reportedly lived in the village of Tockington near Bristol in a house with a \"huge\" Union Jack flying over the front lawn, and owned another house overlooking a game reserve near Pretoria in South Africa.\n\nBanks was offered a junior job at the insurance market of Lloyd's of London. According to \"The Guardian\", by the age of 27, he was running a division of Norwich Union. The article also claims that he spent a year working for Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company of Warren Buffett. However, in another investigation, both Norwich Union and Warren Buffett reject Banks' claim that he worked for them. Then, from an office above a bakery in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, Banks started a motorcycle insurance broker, Motorcycle Direct, and within a few years the company was big enough to sell for \"a few million\". He used the money to found Commercial Vehicle Direct about which he says \"within a very short period we were the largest van insurance company in the country\". Over seven years, along with Australian business partner John Gannon, Banks expanded this business to become Group Direct Limited, and in 2008 the company floated by means of a reverse takeover as Brightside Group. He was its CEO from June 2011 to June 2012, at which time the company was listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). After Banks was dismissed from the company in 2012, he sold £6m worth of the shares in 2013, and received significantly more when the investment firm AnaCap Financial Partners bought Brightside the following year.\n\nBanks was the chief executive (CEO) of Southern Rock Insurance Company in 2014, which underwrites insurance policies for the website GoSkippy.com, founded by Banks. After Banks' departure, Brightside took legal action against him, alleging he used confidential information in setting up GoSkippy.com six months later. There were also legal actions between Southern Rock and Brightside.\n\nHe was previously CEO of AIM-listed Manx Financial Group from April 2008 to February 2009. According to Companies House records, Banks has set up 37 different companies using slight variations of his name. The names used by Banks are Aron Fraser Andrew Banks, Arron Andrew Fraser Banks, Arron Fraser Andrew Banks and Arron Banks. The profiles for the first three names all use the same date of birth but register different lists of companies. When asked by \"The Guardian\" about this, he declined to answer questions on the topic.\n\nBanks also owns Eldon Insurance, whose CEO Elizabeth Bilney was also in charge at Leave.EU, and where Andy Wigmore is also a director. The company's profits leapt to £16.7m for the first half of 2017 after recording a £284,000 profit in 2015 and a loss of £22,500 in 2016 despite a 40% increase in revenue. Banks said that Eldon's business had been transformed by the same AI technology used in the Brexit campaign. The offshore holding company that controls Eldon Insurance is ICS Risk Solutions, which funds many of Banks' activities and has paid over £77m between 2015 and 2018 to prop up Southern Rock after Gibraltarian regulators found the business to be trading while technically insolvent. As part of an agreement with the regulators Banks resigned his directorships at Eldon in 2013 and Southern Rock in 2014, also accepting a \"period of ban or self-exclusion from other insurance directorships\".\n\nHe also bought Old Down Manor from musician Mike Oldfield, converting it into a wedding venue.\n\nIn 2016, the leaked Panama Papers indicated Banks along with Elizabeth Bilney were shareholders of British Virgin Islands company PRI Holdings Limited, which was the sole shareholder of African Strategic Resources Limited. However, a spokesperson for Banks has denied any links to the lawyer named and denies that Banks was involved with the Papers. Banks has stated that he has a controlling interest in a diamond mine in Kimberley, South Africa, and a licence to mine in Lesotho. In July 2018, Banks denied that money paid to a government minister in Lesotho was a bribe; it had been paid to guarantee diamond mining rights in Lesotho. In 2013, Banks paid £65,000 into the private bank account of Thesebe Maseribane, then the Basotho minister for women's equality. Banks subsequently covered the £350,000 costs of a political campaign for Maseribane, in 2014, following a military coup in Lesotho.\n\nIn January 2015, one estimate of his wealth was £100 million. In November 2017, an estimate of £250 million was mentioned.\n\nFollowing intensified media scrutiny after his initial donation to UKIP, it emerged that Banks was involved in mining in southern Africa and had connections to Belize. Banks also has connections to companies based in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, and close connections with family members of the Belizean Prime Minister. However, following remarks made by \"The Thick of It\" creator Armando Iannucci on BBC One's \"Question Time\" programme, Banks denied owning a company in Belize or seeking to avoid UK tax \"via any device\". Describing the comments as \"clearly defamatory\", he threatened legal action towards Iannucci if he did not get an apology within a week.\n\nAsked if his companies paid full corporation tax, Banks said: \"I paid over £2.5m of income tax last year ... My insurance business, like a lot of them, is based in Gibraltar but I've got UK businesses as well that deal with customers and pay tax like everyone else.\" One of the UK businesses of which Banks is director, Rock Services Ltd, had a turnover of £19.7m in 2013 and paid corporation tax of £12,000. The company deducted £19.6m in \"administrative expenses\", and the main activity appears to be \"recharge of goods and services\" with Southern Rock Insurance Company. Southern Rock Insurance states on its website that it underwrites policies for the customers of GoSkippy.com, which is run by Banks.\n\nRock Services and Southern Rock Insurance's ultimate holding company is Rock Holdings Ltd, a company based on the Isle of Man. Banks has also been a \"substantial\" shareholder in STM Fidecs, of which Leave.EU is a subsidiary; the company claims to be specialising in \"international wealth protection\", maximising tax efficiencies for entrepreneurs and expatriates and of \"structuring international groups, particularly separating and relocating intellectual property and treasury functions to low- or no-tax jurisdictions\".\n\nBanks was previously a Conservative Party donor but in October 2014 stated that he £100,000 to UKIP. In response to denials from Prime Minister David Cameron that he had been a large Conservative donor in past years, Banks increased the donation to £1 million to the UK Independence Party (UKIP), directly referencing David Cameron's previous interview as his reasoning. Banks said that he had changed party allegiance because he agrees with UKIP's policies and its view that the European Union \"is holding the UK back\" because it's a \"closed shop for bankrupt countries\". Banks has been described as the \"leading figure\" behind the anti-EU Grassroots Out and Leave.EU, as well as the official Vote Leave campaign.\n\nHe signalled his intention to stand for UKIP in the constituency of Thornbury and Yate at the 2015 general election, but the candidate chosen by the party was Russ Martin, who came third. He indicated he would stand in Clacton at the 2017 general election against Douglas Carswell, but later decided otherwise. \n\nBanks claimed in March 2017 that he had been suspended from UKIP; he believed the reason was that he had criticised the leadership. UKIP said, however, that his membership had lapsed before this time.\n\nIn May 2018, Banks attended a fundraising event for the Democratic Unionist Party, alongside Nigel Farage, and stated that he would support a bid by Farage to seek office as a DUP candidate after the end of his tenure as Member of the European Parliament in 2019.\n\nIn August 2018, it was reported that Banks had applied to join the Conservative Party and had suggested that Leave.EU supporters do the same, with the aim of voting in the party's next leadership election. According to the report, Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU's communications director, who had also applied to join the party, announced that they had received an email welcoming them, but the Conservative Party stated that their applications had not been approved. A Conservative Party spokesman said that welcoming emails were automatic but applications were subsequently reviewed, and theirs had been rejected.\n\nA spokesman for Nigel Farage said that Banks had funded the Chipping Sodbury office for the South Gloucestershire Conservatives \"to the tune of £250,000\". However, a Conservative spokesperson said the support was \"nothing like the order of magnitude\" of sums claimed, and estimated that the donations were \"probably around the £22,000 mark\".\n\nA UKIP source told \"The Guardian\" that Banks had also loaned £75,417 to Thornbury and Yate Conservative Party through Panacea Finance (his former company) in September 2007, registered on the Electoral Commission and to be paid back by 2022. However, Companies House records show that Banks resigned from the company in September 2005; therefore it was considered questionable as to whether Banks was controlling the company at the time, or whether he was \"using the firm as a 'proxy donor'\", according to \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn October 2014, Banks donated £1 million to the UK Independence Party and has since raised the equivalent of $11 million for the party. He has also funded Leave.EU by the equivalent of $5 million, and has been seen as the financial backer of the Brexit campaign.\n\nConservative MP William Hague called Banks \"somebody we haven't heard of\" following his defection to UKIP: In response, Banks increased his donation from £100,000 to £1 million, saying: \"I woke up this morning intending to give £100,000 to UKIP - then I heard Mr Hague's comment about me being a Mr Nobody. So in light of that I have decided to give £1 million.\" This donation was one of the largest sums of money ever received by UKIP.\n\nBanks threatened Douglas Carswell with deselection in September 2015 when it emerged that Carswell supported Vote Leave, as opposed to the Leave.EU campaign funded by Banks, describing Carswell as \"borderline autistic with mental illness wrapped in\", according to \"The Huffington Post\".\n\nIn April 2016, \"Private Eye\" reported that Leave.EU \"is registered at Companies House as Better for the Country Ltd. and controlled by major UKIP donor Arron Banks, after Gibraltar company STM Fidecs Nominees Ltd. transferred its interest to him in August.\" Banks, along with property investor Richard Tice and media guru Andrew Wigmore, donated £4.3m to the group.\n\nBanks credits the success of Leave.EU to their hiring of Goddard Gunster and their subsequent adoption of \"an American-style media approach\". Banks said, \"What [Goddard Gunster] said early on was 'facts don’t work' and that's it. The remain campaign featured fact, fact, fact, fact, fact. It just doesn’t work. You have got to connect with people emotionally. It’s the Trump success.\"\n\nOn 19 October 2017, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw called for an inquiry into Banks' funding of the Leave campaign over concerns of foreign interference in it.\n\nIn September 2016, following Banks' statement that UKIP would be \"dead in the water\" if Diane James did not become leader, he said that he would leave UKIP if Steven Woolfe was prevented from running for leader and two other senior members remained in the party: \"If Neil Hamilton and Douglas Carswell [UKIP's only MP] remain in the party, and the NEC decide that Steven Woolfe cannot run for leader, I will be leaving Ukip\". \n\nBanks was sceptical of UKIP under the leadership of Paul Nuttall. Banks said that Leave.EU would continue campaigning as a \"rightwing Momentum\", ensuring that politicians do not renege on their commitment to leave the EU. Banks has also considered starting and funding a pro-Brexit, nonpartisan citizens' movement called Patriotic Alliance, based on the Five Star Movement, which would target \"the 200 worst, most corrupt MPs\" for deselection.\n\nBanks said that Britain's EU membership \"is like having a first class ticket on the Titanic\". He also said that \"Economically, remaining in the EU is unsustainable.\"\n\nBanks said in May 2016 that his strategy during the Brexit campaign was to \"bore the electorate into submission\", in the hope that a low turnout would favour Brexit.\nBanks threatened to sue the official Vote Leave campaign's candidacy as the official spokesperson for the \"Leave\" vote in the 2016 EU referendum, which may have possibly delayed the vote by two months. However, Banks has since rejected this and stated that he would not pursue a judicial review any further. Banks has also claimed that Vote Leave were deliberately lying when they claimed that the UK sends £350 million to the European Union, claiming this does not take into consideration the rebate which the UK receives from the EU, and that the £350 million is not actually sent to the EU headquarters in Brussels.\n\nFollowing the murder of Jo Cox, Arron Banks commissioned a poll on whether her murder had affected public opinion on voting. Asked whether the wording of the poll was \"tasteless\", Banks said \"I don't think so\", adding that: \"We were hoping to see what the effect of the event was. That is an interesting point of view, whether it would shift public opinion.\"\n\nIn August 2017, Banks wrote to all voters in Philip Hammond's constituency, seeking support for a move to deselect Hammond. In response to a constituent's email, Hammond said \"others will disagree with my views and someone with opposing views to mine can always stand for election against me... I challenge Mr Banks to do so\".\n\nThere were questions as to the source of funds he used to support Brexit and in November 2018 this was referred for criminal investigation. Banks has denied any wrongdoing and stated that he welcomes the police investigation to put an end to the allegations.\n\nFollowing Britain's vote to leave the EU, Banks emailed a note to journalists attacking his critics. Banks described the United Kingdom's parliamentary Electoral Commission as \"the legal division of the In campaign\" and disagreed with their decision to enlist Vote Leave as the official campaign. Banks' response to the information commissioner, who in 2016 fined the campaign £50,000 for sending more than half a million unsolicited text messages, was a succinct \"Whatever\". Banks views the Brexit vote as \"a kind of halfhearted revolution\" due to the fact that Theresa May, who supported Britain remaining in the EU, would end up betraying those who voted to leave.\n\nIn November 2017, the Electoral Commission announced that it is investigating whether election rules were broken during the EU referendum, in donations worth a total of £8.4 million to Leave.EU campaigners made by Banks and by Better for the Country Ltd, a company of which Banks is a registered director.\n\nOn 4 November 2018, regarding the Leave result in the Brexit referendum, Banks said on \"The Andrew Marr Show\": \"The corruption I've seen in British politics, the sewer that exists and the disgraceful behaviour of the government over what they're doing with Brexit and how they're selling it out - means if I had my time again I think we would probably have been better to vote Remain and not unleash these demons.\"\n\nFrom September 2015, Banks, along with Andy Wigmore, had multiple meetings with Russian officials posted at the Russian embassy in London. In November 2015, Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador, introduced Banks to a Russian businessman, which was followed by other business proposals on the part of Russians. Banks was offered a chance to invest in Russian-owned gold or diamond mines; the deal involved funding from a Russian state-owned bank, and was announced 12 days after the Brexit referendum. It is not clear if Banks invested.\n\nFor two years, Banks said his only contacts with the Russian government consisted of one \"boozy lunch\" with the ambassador. After \"The Observer\" reported that he had had multiple meetings at which he had been offered lucrative business deals, Banks told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news he had had \"two or three\" meetings. In July 2018 when pressed by \"The New York Times\", he said there had been a fourth meeting. \"The Observer\" has seen evidence that suggests his Leave.EU campaign team met with Russian embassy officials as many as 11 times in the run-up to the EU referendum and in the two months beyond.\n\nIt has been reported that on 12 November 2016, Arron Banks had a meeting with president-elect Donald Trump in Trump Tower and that upon return to London, Banks had lunch with the Russian ambassador where they discussed the Trump visit.\n\nBanks gave significant funds to LibLabCon.com, a satirical website dedicated to attacking the three major parties. The website included jokes about the treatment of religious people by the Conservatives, claimed Chuka Umunna is \"Labour's chief spokesman for tokenism\" and described Amnesty International as an organisation which supports \"loudmouth idiots chained to a radiator\". UKIP sources said that Banks did not write the material on the website. Despite receiving the support of Banks and Tim Aker, UKIP told the \"Daily Mail\" the website was not linked to them.\n\nOn 19 January 2017 (one day before Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th President of the United States) Banks launched Westmonster alongside Michael Heaver, former press adviser to Nigel Farage. It is modelled on the right-wing US websites Breitbart News and the Drudge Report and claims to be \"pro-Brexit, pro-Farage, pro-Trump, anti-establishment, anti-open borders, anti-corporatism\". Banks believes that Leave.EU's 800,000 Twitter followers will drive traffic towards the website. In the morning of 19 January, Westmonster's Twitter account had gained more than 2,500 followers.\n\nWestmonster is co-owned by Arron Banks and Michael Heaver, former press adviser to Nigel Farage.\n\nThe official registered owners of the site are Heaver, who owns 50% of the website and is a daily editor, and Better for the Country Ltd. Better for the Country Ltd is the company that ran Leave.EU (one of two main pro-Brexit campaigns, affiliated to Farage) and is directed by Leave.EU's chief executive, Elizabeth Bilney. Better for the Country Ltd is also registered to the same address as Westmonster. \n\nWestmonster's welcome message stated that the political establishment had \"taken one hell of a beating\" in 2016, adding that \"2017 might just be even bigger\". The timing of this launch was seen as sign that the anti-establishment media which helped Trump to gain power was arriving in the UK, according to BBC News' media editor Amol Rajan.\n\nAlthough primarily a news aggregator website akin to the \"Drudge Report\", Westmonster does plan to publish original content and enlist the support of celebrities and backbench MPs. Early contributions to the website include a piece written by Nigel Farage stating that the \"political establishment\" of the United Kingdom had not woken up to European populist movements, as well as articles showing majority British support for a burka ban and attacking \"remoaners\" for \"trying to subvert the will of the people\".\n\n"}

He became prominent in politics during the Sandinista (FSLN) era. After repeatedly resigning from positions in protest, opinion divided between those who lauded him as a statesman and man of principle, and those who derided him as an ineffectual hand-wringer.\n\nCruz grew up in Jinotepe, Nicaragua. His father despised Anastasio Somoza García, despite the family's traditional Liberal loyalties. Cruz graduated from the military academy in 1944, but refused his commission rather than serve Somoza's dictatorship. He went on to attend Georgetown University in the United States. Cruz participated in a 1947 coup plot against Somoza, for which he was imprisoned for four months. After joining the April Rebellion of 1954, together with his brother-in-law, Adolfo Báez Bone, and Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, he was jailed again for about a year, while Báez was executed. However, his wife persuaded him not to join Edmundo and Fernando \"El Negro\" Chamorro in their November 1960 rising, which included an attack on the Jinotepe barracks. He would avoid rebel politics for nearly two decades.\n\nIn 1969, Cruz became an official at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C.. There, he was approached by the FSLN in 1977. He became a member of \"Los Doce\", the Group of Twelve establishment figures who voiced support for the Sandinista struggle against dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Their backing of the Sandinistas' popular front convinced many Nicaraguans that the FSLN's appeal had broadened beyond its communist roots, and moved the country towards the full-scale insurrection that toppled the régime in July 1979.\n\nCruz was appointed head of the Central Bank in post-Somoza Nicaragua. When the non-communist moderates resigned from the Junta of National Reconstruction in April 1980, after finding that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate, he joined the Junta as a replacement moderate on May 18. He too became frustrated with his impotence, but agreed to leave gracefully by becoming ambassador to the United States. The arrangement was announced on March 4, 1981.\n\nCruz continued to clash with Sandinista policies, and resigned as ambassador in November 1981, returning to the IADB. However, he was a major ghostwriter for the speech delivered by Sandinista hero Edén Pastora at his press conference of April 15, 1982, in which Pastora declared his break with the FSLN National Directorate. Pastora's speech helped convince his son, Arturo Cruz, Jr., who was not then aware of his father's role, to also move from supporting the Sandinistas to joining Pastora's camp.\n\nWhen the Sandinistas announced in January 1984 that they would hold elections in November, the right-wing opposition umbrella group, the Coordinadora Democrática Nicaragüense, settled on Cruz as the only candidate acceptable to all factions. However, in the end he boycotted the election, saying it would not be free and fair. Years later he admitted that his decision not to run was a mistake and that he was on the payroll of the CIA.\n\nAfterwards, Cruz drifted deeper into the politics of the rebel Contras. He was a primary drafter of the San José Declaration of March 1, 1985, signed by many rebel leaders. The declaration evolved into the formation of the rebel umbrella group United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) on June 12, with Alfonso Robelo and the Nicaraguan Democratic Force's Adolfo Calero. However, with Calero's FDN comprising the great majority of UNO's forces, he found himself in another figurehead position. He continually threatened to resign unless he and Robelo were given real power. Despite Calero's eventual resignation in February 1987, he quit anyway on March 9.\n\nIn 1999, he issued a statement asking the United States and Honduran governments to release all information about the death of his nephew, David Arturo Báez Cruz, a naturalized American citizen and former Green Beret who returned to Nicaragua to serve in Sandinista military intelligence, and died while acting as a military advisor with Honduran guerrillas.\n\n"}

He married Sara Abigail da Silva, daughter of Semuel da Silva, in 1628. Their sons and grandsons joined the court of the Gottorps, and a daughter was married to Gabriel Milan, who would later be appointed governor of the Danish West-Indies (now U.S. Virgin Islands). Around this time, Musaphia graduated from the Padua medical school, which was regarded as the best of its kind at the time.\n\nAfter Sara's death on August 7, 1634, Musaphia dedicated \"Zekher Rav\", an adaptation of the creation myth in which all Hebrew word roots are used exactly once, to her. It was first published in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1635, and a second edition with a Latin translation was published in Hamburg in 1638.\n\nAnother work was published in 1640, namely \"Sacro-Medicæ Sententiæ ex Bibliis\", a medical treatise containing about 800 sentences on medicine. It contained a section on alchemy that created some stirring at the time. Musaphia also dedicated a work on ebb and flow to Christian IV of Denmark in 1642.\n\nIn 1646, while living in Glückstadt, Holstein, Musaphia was appointed royal physician to the Danish court by Christian IV.\n\nAround 1648, probably in connection with the death of Christian IV, Musaphia went to Amsterdam and joined the college of rabbis.

Musaphia was also working on a revised version of the Talmud, which was nevertheless never published, and the manuscripts have since been lost.\n\nIn the mid-1660s, Musaphia was caught up in the Sabbateans movement, which proclaimed that Sabbatai Zevi was the new Messiah.\n\nHis brother Albert Dionis was one of the wealthiest Jews in Hamburg in 1614.\n\nMusaphia died in 1675, in Amsterdam.\n\n\n"}

Kennedy and his surviving \"PT-109\" crew following the boat's collision with the Japanese destroyer \"Amagiri\" near Plum Pudding Island on 1 August 1943. They were from the Western Province of the Solomon Islands.\n\nDuring World War II, Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana were tasked with patrolling the waters of the Solomon Sea near Gizo with Australian coastwatcher Sub-Lieutenant Arthur Reginald Evans, who manned a secret observation post at the top of Kolombangara island's Mount Veve volcano. Evans had spotted an explosion on 1 August, and later decoded news that the explosion he had witnessed was probably from the lost \"PT-109\". On 2 August Gasa and Kumana were dispatched by Evans to search in their dugout canoe for possible \"PT-109\" survivors. Abandoning their sinking ship, Kennedy and his men swam first to the very tiny Plum Pudding island. \n\nThey later abandoned Plum Pudding Island and swam to tiny Olasana Island in search of food and water. On Olsana, Kennedy found coconuts and fresh water which were of some small help to his men. On Olsana Island, Kennedy was discovered by the two islander men. The canoe couldn't accommodate all of the PT-109 crewmen safely, and the islanders and English-speaking crew had difficulty communicating with each other. In absence of writing utensils, Biuku Gasa suggested that Kennedy should inscribe a message on the husk of a coconut he had plucked from a nearby palm tree. This carved message, after rowing their dugout canoe at great risk through of hostile waters patrolled by the Japanese, was then delivered to the nearest Allied base at Rendova. They enabled the ensuing return to Olasana and the successful American rescue operation.\n\nKennedy later invited Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana to attend his presidential inauguration in 1961, but the pair was duped en route in Honiara, the Solomon Islands capital, by British colonial officials who sent other representatives instead. Another version of the story is that they were turned back by British officials at the airport. The story from Biuku's descendants is that the British officials did not want to send Biuku and Eroni because they were simple village men and not well dressed (by the British authorities' standards). This was a sad outcome for two men who were as much war heroes as those they helped rescue. They were volunteers who willingly helped U.S. forces with disregard to their own safety or wellbeing, and who knew full well what the retributions would have been if they had been discovered by the Japanese. The legend of these two men survives to this day among their descendants in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands. \n\nAnother scout, Alesasa Bisili, wrote of his experience during the 1942 Japanese landing at Munda in \"Scouting in Western Solomons\". He expressed sadness and anger over the unjust lack of recognition or award given to Solomon Islanders for their services during the war.\n\nHowever, in recognition of his help, Biuku Gasa lived in a house paid for by the Kennedy family ($5k), National Geographic ($5k) and the balance ($15k) by Brian and Sue Mitchell. The BBC reference that the Kennedy family paid for the entire house is incorrect. The house was designed by Brian Mitchell in co-operation with a Brisbane-based Australian architect. Melody Miller, Senator Edward Kennedy's Press Secretary, was responsible for pulling all the parties together after being approached by Brian and Sue Mitchell. The Kennedys also constructed a house for Eroni Kumana. It fell down in the 2007 tsunami, but Kumana survived the storm.\n\nGasa and Kumana were interviewed by \"National Geographic\" in 2002, and can be seen on the DVD of the television special. They were presented a bust by Max Kennedy, a son of Robert Kennedy. The \"National Geographic\" had gone there as part of an expedition by Robert Ballard, the discoverer of the wreck of the \"Titanic\", who did find the remains of the PT-109. The special was called \"The Search for Kennedy's PT 109\".\n\nIn 2003, a swim was organized to raise money for Biuku Gasa's community.\n\nBiuku Gasa was born 27 July 1923, in Madou, Solomon Islands, and lived in Vavudu Village, Kauvi Island, in the Western Solomons. He went to a Seventh-day Adventist missionary school, but did not speak English well. After the war Gasa and his wife Nelma had six children. They lived off coconuts and crops. They also caught fish in Vonavona lagoon. Gasa was the local patriarch, as most of the residents are descendants of the \"old man\" – as he was known – and he rarely left the island.\n\nGasa was still alive in August 2005 when the Pacific edition of \"Time\" magazine wrote that he was sick in the hospital. His children built a dugout canoe just like the ones the old man had made in his youth, to send to the United States \"so they would not forget\". Biuku Gasa died on 23 November 2005, the day after the 42nd anniversary of Kennedy's assassination.\n\nEroni Kumana said he was 78 in 2003, and would have been 18 in 1943. Also schooled by Adventist missionaries, he lived in Konqu Village, Ranongga Island. He was seen in \"National Geographic\" photographs with a hat and a T-shirt that read \"I rescued JFK\". Kumana created a shrine with an obelisk to JFK, and appointed him honorary chief. Kumana died on 2 August 2014, 71 years to the day after the search mission began. He was 96.\n\n\n"}

He has been described as \"the greatest entrepreneur of 'class' journalism\".\n\nCox was born in Taunton, the son of William Cox, a manufacturer and Harriet, daughter of William Upcott of Exeter. He became a solicitor in Taunton, and in 1836 established a local newspaper there, the \"Somerset County Gazette\". He was called to the bar in 1843, joined the Western Circuit, and sold the title.\n\nCox moved to London to pursue his career as a barrister. His periodicals, reports and textbooks led to him being raised to the dignity of serjeant at law in 1868 – rather than his modest practice as a lawyer.\n\nHe held various significant legal appointments – Recorder of Helston and Falmouth 1857–1868 which he resigned when gaining the more important appointment as Recorder of Portsmouth. In 1870 he became Deputy Assistant Judge of the Middlesex Sessions, a position he continued to discharge until his death.\n\nAround the time he was called to the bar, Cox founded the weekly \"Law Times\" which he conducted for nearly 25 years. He also founded or transformed the English journals \"The Field\", bought cheaply from Benjamin Nottingham Webster,and the \"Exchange & Mart\"; also \"The Queen\", founded by Samuel Beeton and bought by Cox in 1862, merged in 1863 with \"Ladies' Paper\", and edited by Elizabeth Lowe under Horace Cox (his nephew), and the \"County Courts' Chronicle\". An enduring publication was \"Crockford's Clerical Directory\", started in 1858, although whether it was really his creation or that of his junior partner, John Crockford, remains an area of debate. Cox also set up his own newspapers. Some of them, like \"The Critic\", had only limited success, but others such as \"Bazaar\" were profitable. Long before his death, he relinquished direct control over the publishing businesses but he continued to write.\n\nA lifelong Conservative, he unsuccessfully contested Tewkesbury in 1854 and Taunton in 1866. He did get elected in his native town 1868 but was unseated on petition by Henry James; James successfully brought a bribery petition. Cox was a Deputy Lieutenant and JP for Middlesex, and a JP for Westminster.\n\nCox spent freely on his joint interests on orchids and psychology. He had lectured on phrenology in 1834, and retained an interest in it. The London Dialectical Society, founded in 1867, set up in 1869 a committee to investigate spiritualism, of which Cox was a member. In 1871 he assisted William Crookes in his experiments into what Cox called \"psychic force\" Cox was interested in the psychological side of mediumship. Some have viewed him as a spiritualist rather than one interested in \"secular\" psychology; but he is said to have rejected the \"spirit hypothesis\". In 1875, he founded the Psychological Society for Great Britain, with George Harris; it was quickly dissolved after his death. In 1876 he passed to the medium Daniel Dunglas Home details of trickery used by others in séances.\n\nCox bought the fee simple (unfettered freehold) of the Serjeants' Inn in Chancery Lane at auction in 1877 for £57,100. The Inn's hall was reconstructed at his new house at Mill Hill (then Middlesex, now London, NW7) with the original stained glass windows from the hall and chapel at the inn.\n\nHis diversification proved profitable. When one of his heirs offered their reversionary interest in Cox's probate estate for sale the advertisement listed the sources of income. These included various leasehold properties in the City of London, Marlow Mills in Buckinghamshire, his newspaper and magazine titles as well as his landed property. Taken together, these had produced £54,000 a year for some years, although the bulk of the income came from Cox's magazines and newspapers.\n\nCox is an example of the wealthy early Victorian middle class men who established large landed estates. He began in 1866 by the purchase of Moat Mount. He rebuilt the house as a Renaissance-style stuccoed villa to include a large main block with a carriage porch, and by 1873 owned in Middlesex. He and his son continued to add to the estate in Hendon and Edgware until it covered perhaps of valuable land near London. The estate included Moat Mount Park (120 acres), plus Coventry Farm (of 127 acres), Stoneyfields, Broadfields, Bays Hill, and Barnet Gate. Cox kept a pack of hounds, and he and his son hunted over what are now Golders Green, Hendon, Mill Hill and Hampstead Garden Suburb. While some land was sold in 1906, remained to form public open spaces and part of the Broadfields housing estate in Edgware when the Cox estate was finally broken up in June 1923.\n\nCox was also lord of the manors of Taunton Deane and Trull in Somerset. He also owned small estates at Ugborough and Widecombe in Devon. He died worth a reputed £400,000; although his estate was declared as under £200,000, he owned at least as much again in landed property.\n\nCox married twice. His first wife, Sophia, was the daughter of William Harris of the Royal Artillery, and they married in 1836. In 1845 he married Rosalinda Fonblanque, the only daughter of John Samuel Martin Fonblanque, a Commissioner in Bankruptcy. The son from his first marriage was Irwin E. B. Cox, and he had a daughter now known as the novelist Mrs H. Bennett Edwards (1844–1936); there was another son, from the second marriage. Irwin Cox carried on his father's business interests, his acquisition of land and his preservation of game on the Mill Hill estate until his death in 1922 when the estate was broken up.\n\nCox's works included:\n\nCox prepared law books and reports with others, and contributed to the \"Transactions\" of the Psychological Society and the London Dialectical Society.\n\n"}

The charges against Israel were dismissed by the prosecutor, Homer Stille Cummings, who later became Attorney General of the United States.\n\nThe case, which gained national attention, became the basis for a 1947 film by Elia Kazan, \"Boomerang!\". The Israel prosecution was praised in the Wickersham Commission report on law enforcement in the United States, which criticized police interrogation methods.\n\nIsrael, a vagrant and former serviceman, was charged with the murder of Father Hubert Dahme, a popular Catholic priest, at the intersection of High and Main Street in downtown Bridgeport in the evening of Feb. 4, 1924. Twelve thousand people attended the funeral.\n\nHomer Cummings, the prosecutor, said the evidence was so strong that \"upon its face, at least, seemed well nigh a perfect case.\" Israel met the general physical description of the gunman, was in the vicinity at the time of the shooting, and he was in possession of the gun that the police believe had been used in the crime, a black .32 caliber revolver. The police case included identifications by seven eyewitnesses, and Israel confessed to the crime, though he later recanted and protested his innocence. \n\nAt arraignment on May 27, 1924, Cummings dropped the case, entered a plea of nolle prosequi, and proceeded to discredit the evidence compiled by the Bridgeport police in a 90-minute presentation to the court.\n\nCummings rebutted the circumstantial case against Israel, who was serving a 90-day jail term for possession of the .32 caliber revolver, and said that the confession was coerced from a person of diminished mental capacity. Three physicians had found that Israel was exhausted and overwhelmed, and Israel said he would have confessed to anything just to get some sleep. Cummings called expert witnesses who undermined the ballistics evidence.\n\nCummings told the court that \"it is just as important for a state's attorney to use the great powers of his office to protect the innocent as it is to convict the guilty.\"\n\nCummings' decision to drop the case surprised and outraged Bridgeport police, and Cummings received criticism from the Democratic Party, where he was a national committeeman. However, despite being snubbed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he was chosen by Roosevelt as his first Attorney General.\n\nThe case was never solved. In 1954, a Bridgeport resident admitted to witnessing the killing, said that he was threatened with death if he spoke about it, and said that Israel was not the killer.\n\nIsrael later married and had \"a house, a Ford, a wife, and a child.\" In \"Boomerang!\", which was largely filmed in Stamford, Connecticut, the character based on Israel was played by Arthur Kennedy.\n"}

Efforts to find historical evidence of his existence have been unsuccessful. According to works of fiction, he was a participant in the Haitian Revolution under Dutty Boukman and Toussaint Louverture as well as active in piracy for nearly a 30-year period during the early 19th century.\n\nHenri Caesar has been confused with a real pirate who was also known as Black Caesar and operated from the Florida Keys in the early 1700s until being captured and hanged in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1718.\n\nHenri Caesar was supposedly born to a slave family kept by a French plantation owner known as Arnaut. He worked as a houseboy on the estate and, as a young man, worked in the lumberyard. He was mistreated by the supervisor and later killed the man during the slave insurrection, torturing him with a saw. Joining the rebel forces led by Dutty Boukman and Toussaint Louverture, he remained with the revolution until its independence from France in 1804, when he left to try his luck at sea. Based in Port-de-Paix, he captured a Spanish ship in 1805 and soon began attacking small villages and lone vessels near Cuba and the Bahamas from his base in southern Spanish Florida. Adopting the name Black Caesar, he was very successful during his piratical career before his disappearance in 1830.\n\nHis fate is uncertain. He may have fled the area after President Andrew Jackson ordered an expedition against pirates active on the Florida coast after its purchase by the United States in 1821. One version of his story says that he was captured, taken to Key West, and burned to death while tied to a tree. The widow of a preacher whose eyes had been burned out under torture from Black Caesar was allowed light the fire.\n\nCaesar is supposed to have buried between $2 and $6 million at one of more locations in southwest Florida including Pine Island, White Horse Key, Marco Island, Elliot Key and Sanibel Island, although none has ever been recovered. He is sometimes associated with Jose Gaspar, another mythical pirate who supposedly operated in the same area at about the same time.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19700653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19700653", "title": "Isaac Massa", "text": "Isaac Massa\n\nIsaac Abrahamszoon Massa (baptized October 7, 1586, in Haarlem, died 1643) was a Dutch grain trader, traveller and diplomat, the envoy to Muscovy. He wrote memoirs related to the Time of Troubles and created some of the earliest maps of Eastern Europe and Siberia. Due to Massa's experience in and knowledge of Muscovy, he was considered a Dutch \"Kremlinologist.\" The Isaac Massa Foundation was established in his honor in Groningen. It aims to stimulate scientific and cultural contacts between the Russian Federation and the Netherlands.\n\nIsaac Massa was born into a wealthy silk merchant's family; his father Abraham Massa had relocated the family from Liège to Haarlem before Isaac was born. His ancestors could have been French Huguenots who fled their homeland in the beginning of the Reformation. The family surname was also known as \"Massart,\" \"Massaert,\" suggesting French origins, which is where most Huguenots started. Under religious persecution, they generally relocated to Protestant countries, such as England and those of northern Europe.\n\nIn 1601 Massa left Haarlem for Moscow to assist the family trade. Isaac was witness to the second half of Boris Godunov's reign, during which a civil war broke out, now known as the Time of Troubles. He survived the capture of Moscow by False Dmitriy I and left Russia in 1609, before the fall of Tsar Vasily Shuysky. \n\nMassa compiled an account of the 1601–1609 events (), which he presented to Stadtholder Maurice. It was reproduced in print in the nineteenth century. In 1612–1613 Massa published two articles on Russian events and the geography of the \"Land of Samoyeds,\" accompanied by a map of Russia, which were published in an almanac edited by Hessel Gerritsz. His notes on his various travels have been published in conjunction with maps made by the explorer Henry Hudson.\n\nThese articles were translated and reproduced anonymously in European languages, because the author's name was removed in early Dutch reissues. The most complete translations were published in Russian in 1937 (reissued in 1997) and in English in 1982. Massa's writing was based on an underlying religious concept of punishment for sins being indispensable. He believed that Godunov, False Dimitri, and the nation itself paid for their mortal sins. (Massa believed that Godunov killed Feodor I and the real Tsarevich Dimitri). Russian sources consider him the least biased of contemporary Western witnesses, and very well informed. (His contemporary, Jacob De la Gardie, characterized Massa as \"extremely artful in learning other people's secrets\").\n\nMassa is credited with five published maps of Russia and its provinces, the last ones compiled around 1633, and two maps of Moscow city, including the schematic account of the 1606 battle between Vasily Shuysky and Ivan Bolotnikov's armies. Retrieving original maps of the city could have been dangerous for Massa himself and fatal for his Russian sources. Massa's rendition of the Siberian coast represented an advance in geography; for decades it was the only map of this region. It was subsequently copied by Gerardus Mercator and Jodocus Hondius, Jan Janssonius and Willem Blaeu.\n\nIn 1614 Massa returned to Moscow, this time accompanied by his brothers, as an envoy of States-General of the Netherlands to obtain an exclusive trade agreement similar to the recent Dutch-Ottoman treaty, and to investigate the trade routes into Persia. Not only had the Dutch been keen to purchase grains but also Persian silks. These had, equally so, been exported via Archangelsk. At the time Russian people showed great interest in artillery compounds such as lead and gunpowder.\n\nAn average of thirty ships sailed each year to Archangelsk, a harbour near the White Sea – unfortunately during 1619 a fire broke out and destroyed the city completely, thereby ruining Massa's inventory. Additionally, upon his return Massa's ship encountered a heavy storm near Lapland.\n\nIn April 1622 he married Beatrix van der Laen, the daughter of a Remonstrant burgomaster. When Hals had a child baptized, Massa was a witness. In 1623/24 Massa was called upon by the Dutch Parliament (Staten-Generaal) to become an agent for Moscovia. However, his appointment proved to be a controversial one and drew serious opposition. He then made successful efforts to gain the interest of Gustaf II Adolf of Sweden to pursue trading grains with Russia. While nourishing the relationships between Russia and Sweden, he was knighted by the Swedish King in 1625 for his arduous efforts. One year later, in 1626, he attempted to gain exclusive rights on the trading of grains out of Russia.\n\nMassa promoted the idea of setting up a trading cartel similar to the English Muscovy Company, but internal problems in the Netherlands delayed consolidation of traders into 1628. During his next voyage, in 1629, he travelled to Moscow to pave the way for his friend Elias Trip who by then had initiated a consortium. Massa indiscreetly advised Michael I of Russia and Michael's father, Filaret (the Patriarch of Moscow) of the internal affairs of the Dutch Republic. By doing so he attempted to tarnish the reputation of his competitors and personal opponents.\n\nBecause of the ongoing war between Sweden and Poland no grain could be exported through the city of Dantzig. One of his opponents, Klenck, himself a wealthy merchant trading in caviar, was given Russia's permission to export ten or twelve cargo loads of rye meal. Meanwhile Trip feigned to act on behalf of the Swedish Monarchy.\n\nIn 1630 the price of grain remained extremely high due to increasing competition. Albert Burgh tried to ensure a monopoly for the City of Amsterdam. At the same time, countries such as Sweden and England endeavoured to do the same. Russian merchants tried to curtail trading by limiting import and export exclusively via Archangelsk. For the next two decades Massa combined diplomatic service with his own business.\n\nMassa has been the subject of several portraits by Dutch painter Frans Hals, including a a marriage portrait with his wife, Beatrix Van Der Laen, dated 1622 and a solo portrait of him leaning over the back of a chair dated 1626, and . The wedding portrait is considered unique in composition for the period., The novel composition, \"picnic style\", may have been Massa's own design. Massa owned a country house near Lisse, next to his brother-in-law, Adriaen Maertensz Block. He was the protector of Torrentius, a notorious painter from Haarlem.\n\n"}

{"id": "81859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81859", "title": "James Prescott Joule", "text": "James Prescott Joule\n\nJames Prescott Joule (; 24 December 1818 11 October 1889) was an English physicist, mathematician and brewer, born in Salford, Lancashire. Joule studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work (see energy). This led to the law of conservation of energy, which in turn led to the development of the first law of thermodynamics. The SI derived unit of energy, the joule, is named after him.\n\nJoule worked with Lord Kelvin to develop an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, which came to be called the Kelvin scale. Joule also made observations of magnetostriction, and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated, which is also called Joule's first law. His experiments about energy transformations were first published in 1843.\n\nJames Joule was born in 1818, the son of Benjamin Joule (1784–1858), a wealthy brewer, and his wife, Alice Prescott, on New Bailey Street in Salford. Joule was tutored as a young man by the famous scientist John Dalton and was strongly influenced by chemist William Henry and Manchester engineers Peter Ewart and Eaton Hodgkinson. He was fascinated by electricity, and he and his brother experimented by giving electric shocks to each other and to the family's servants.\n\nAs an adult, Joule managed the brewery. Science was merely a serious hobby. Sometime around 1840, he started to investigate the feasibility of replacing the brewery's steam engines with the newly invented electric motor. His first scientific papers on the subject were contributed to William Sturgeon's \"Annals of Electricity\". Joule was a member of the London Electrical Society, established by Sturgeon and others.\n\nMotivated in part by a businessman's desire to quantify the economics of the choice, and in part by his scientific inquisitiveness, he set out to determine which prime mover was more efficient. He discovered Joule's first law in 1841, that \"the heat which is evolved by the proper action of any voltaic current is proportional to the square of the intensity of that current, multiplied by the resistance to conduction which it experiences\". He went on to realize that burning a pound of coal in a steam engine was more economical than a costly pound of zinc consumed in an electric battery. Joule captured the output of the alternative methods in terms of a common standard, the ability to raise a mass weighing one pound to a height of one foot, the \"foot-pound\".\n\nHowever, Joule's interest diverted from the narrow financial question to that of how much work could be extracted from a given source, leading him to speculate about the convertibility of energy. In 1843 he published results of experiments showing that the heating effect he had quantified in 1841 was due to generation of heat in the conductor and not its transfer from another part of the equipment. This was a direct challenge to the caloric theory which held that heat could neither be created or destroyed. Caloric theory had dominated thinking in the science of heat since introduced by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783. Lavoisier's prestige and the practical success of Sadi Carnot's caloric theory of the heat engine since 1824 ensured that the young Joule, working outside either academia or the engineering profession, had a difficult road ahead. Supporters of the caloric theory readily pointed to the symmetry of the Peltier–Seebeck effect to claim that heat and current were convertible in an, at least approximately, reversible process.\n\nFurther experiments and measurements with his electric motor led Joule to estimate the \"mechanical equivalent of heat\" as 4.1868 joules per calorie of work to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one Kelvin. He announced his results at a meeting of the chemical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Cork in August 1843 and was met by silence.\n\nJoule was undaunted and started to seek a purely mechanical demonstration of the conversion of work into heat. By forcing water through a perforated cylinder, he could measure the slight viscous heating of the fluid. He obtained a mechanical equivalent of 770 ft·lbf/Btu (4.14 joule/calorie (J/cal)). The fact that the values obtained both by electrical and purely mechanical means were in agreement to at least one order of magnitude was, to Joule, compelling evidence of the reality of the convertibility of work into heat.\n\nJoule now tried a third route. He measured the heat generated against the work done in compressing a gas. He obtained a mechanical equivalent of 798 ft·lbf/Btu (4.29 J/cal). In many ways, this experiment offered the easiest target for Joule's critics but Joule disposed of the anticipated objections by clever experimentation. Joule read his paper to the Royal Society on 20 June 1844, however, his paper was rejected for publishing by the Royal Society and he had to be content with publishing in the \"Philosophical Magazine\" in 1845. In the paper he was forthright in his rejection of the caloric reasoning of Carnot and Émile Clapeyron, a rejection partly theologically driven:\n\nJoule here adopts the language of \"vis viva\" (energy), possibly because Hodgkinson had read a review of Ewart's \"On the measure of moving force\" to the Literary and Philosophical Society in April 1844.\n\nJoule wrote in his 1844 paper:\n\nIn June 1845, Joule read his paper \"On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat\" to the British Association meeting in Cambridge. In this work, he reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight, in which gravity does the mechanical work, to spin a paddle wheel in an insulated barrel of water which increased the temperature. He now estimated a mechanical equivalent of 819 ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). He wrote a letter to the Philosophical Magazine, published in September 1845 describing his experiment.\n\nIn 1850, Joule published a refined measurement of 772.692 ft·lbf/Btu (4.159 J/cal), closer to twentieth century estimates.\n\nMuch of the initial resistance to Joule's work stemmed from its dependence upon extremely precise measurements. He claimed to be able to measure temperatures to within of a degree Fahrenheit (3 mK). Such precision was certainly uncommon in contemporary experimental physics but his doubters may have neglected his experience in the art of brewing and his access to its practical technologies. He was also ably supported by scientific instrument-maker John Benjamin Dancer. Joule's experiments complemented the theoretical work of Rudolf Clausius, who is considered by some to be the coinventor of the energy concept.\n\nJoule was proposing a kinetic theory of heat (he believed it to be a form of rotational, rather than translational, kinetic energy), and this required a conceptual leap: if heat was a form of molecular motion, why didn't the motion of the molecules gradually die out? Joule's ideas required one to believe that the collisions of molecules were perfectly elastic. We should also remember that the very existence of atoms and molecules was not widely accepted for another 50 years.\n\nAlthough it may be hard today to understand the allure of the caloric theory, at the time it seemed to have some clear advantages. Carnot's successful theory of heat engines had also been based on the caloric assumption, and only later was it proved by Lord Kelvin that Carnot's mathematics were equally valid without assuming a caloric fluid.\n\nHowever, in Germany, Hermann Helmholtz became aware both of Joule's work and the similar 1842 work of Julius Robert von Mayer. Though both men had been neglected since their respective publications, Helmholtz's definitive 1847 declaration of the conservation of energy credited them both.\n\nAlso in 1847, another of Joule's presentations at the British Association in Oxford was attended by George Gabriel Stokes, Michael Faraday, and the precocious and maverick William Thomson, later to become Lord Kelvin, who had just been appointed professor of natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow. Stokes was \"inclined to be a Joulite\" and Faraday was \"much struck with it\" though he harboured doubts. Thomson was intrigued but sceptical.\n\nUnanticipated, Thomson and Joule met later that year in Chamonix. Joule married Amelia Grimes on 18 August and the couple went on honeymoon. Marital enthusiasm notwithstanding, Joule and Thomson arranged to attempt an experiment a few days later to measure the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the Cascade de Sallanches waterfall, though this subsequently proved impractical.\n\nThough Thomson felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into a spirited defence of the Carnot-Clapeyron school. In his 1848 account of absolute temperature, Thomson wrote that \"the conversion of heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered\" – but a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's \"very remarkable discoveries\". Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on the 27th, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views. Though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's. In his 1851 paper, Thomson was willing to go no further than a compromise and declared \"the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius\".\n\nAs soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the Joule–Thomson effect, and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the kinetic theory.\n\nKinetics is the science of motion. Joule was a pupil of Dalton and it is no surprise that he had learned a firm belief in the atomic theory, even though there were many scientists of his time who were still skeptical. He had also been one of the few people receptive to the neglected work of John Herapath on the kinetic theory of gases. He was further profoundly influenced by Peter Ewart's 1813 paper \"On the measure of moving force\".\n\nJoule perceived the relationship between his discoveries and the kinetic theory of heat. His laboratory notebooks reveal that he believed heat to be a form of rotational, rather than translational motion.\n\nJoule could not resist finding antecedents of his views in Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, John Locke, Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) and Sir Humphry Davy. Though such views are justified, Joule went on to estimate a value for the mechanical equivalent of heat of 1034 foot-pound from Rumford's publications. Some modern writers have criticised this approach on the grounds that Rumford's experiments in no way represented systematic quantitative measurements. In one of his personal notes, Joule contends that Mayer's measurement was no more accurate than Rumford's, perhaps in the hope that Mayer had not anticipated his own work.\n\nJoule has been attributed with explaining the green flash phenomenon in a letter to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1869; actually, he merely noted (with a sketch) the last glimpse as bluish green, without attempting to explain the cause of the phenomenon.\n\nJoule died at home in Sale and is buried in Brooklands cemetery there. His gravestone is inscribed with the number \"772.55\", his climacteric 1878 measurement of the mechanical equivalent of heat, in which he found that this amount of foot-pounds of work must be expended at sea level to raise the temperature of one pound of water from 60 to 61 °F. There is also a quotation from the Gospel of John: \"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work\" (9:4). The Wetherspoon's pub in Sale, the town of his death, is named \"The J. P. Joule\" after him. Joule's family brewery survives to this day but is now located in Market Drayton (see Joule’s Brewery for more information on origins).\n\nJoule's many honours and commendations include:\n\n\nThere is a memorial to Joule in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey, though he is not buried there, contrary to what some biographies state. A statue of Joule by Alfred Gilbert stands in Manchester Town Hall, opposite that of Dalton.\n\nIn 1847, Joule married Amelia Grimes. Joule became a widower when she died in 1854, 7 years after their wedding. They had three children together: a son, Benjamin Arthur Joule (1850–1922), a daughter, Alice Amelia (1852–1899) and a second son, Henry (born 1854, who died three weeks later).\n\n\n\n"}

She lived on a dairy farm north of Beijing before her death on June 8, 2010.\n\nOn 20 October 1921, Hinton was born as Joan Chase Hinton in Chicago, Illinois. Her father, Sebastian Hinton, was a lawyer (who also was the inventor of the jungle gym); her mother, Carmelita Hinton, was an educator and the founder of The Putney School, an independent progressive school in Vermont.\n\nHer sister, Jean Hinton Rosner (1917–2002), was a civil rights and peace activist. Joan Hinton's great-grandfather was the mathematician George Boole; Ethel Lilian Voynich, a great-aunt, was the author of \"The Gadfly\", a novel later read by millions of Soviet and Chinese readers.\n\nHinton graduated from the Putney School, where her skiing skills qualified her for a berth on the 1940 U.S. Ski Team at the Winter Olympic Games, had they been held that year. She studied physics at Bennington College and graduated with a bachelor's degree in natural science from Bennington College. In 1944, Hinton earned a doctorate in Physics from University of Wisconsin.\n\nShe observed the Trinity test at Alamogordo and wrote about it:\n\nIt was like being at the bottom of an ocean of light. We were bathed in it from all directions. The light withdrew into the bomb as if the bomb sucked it up. Then it turned purple and blue and went up and up and up. We were still talking in whispers when the cloud reached the level where it was struck by the rising sunlight so it cleared out the natural clouds. We saw a cloud that was dark and red at the bottom and daylight at the top. Then suddenly the sound reached us. It was very sharp and rumbled and all the mountains were rumbling with it. We suddenly started talking out loud and felt exposed to the whole world.\n\nJoan Hinton was shocked when the US government, three weeks later, dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. She left the Manhattan Project and lobbied the government in Washington to internationalize nuclear power.\n\nHer brother William H. Hinton (1919–2004) had travelled to China for the first time in 1937 and returned after the war. His book \"Fanshen: Documentary of Revolution in a Chinese Village\", published in 1966 after many years of obstacles, described his observations of land reform in the communist-occupied area of Northwest China.\n\nIn March 1948, Joan Hinton travelled to Shanghai, worked for Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, and tried to establish contacts with the Chinese communists. She witnessed the communists gaining control of Beijing in 1949 and moved to Yan'an, where she married Erwin Engst, who had been working in China since 1946. After 5 months living in caves in 1949 they moved to Inner Mongolia to work on a state farm, living meagerly in a stockaded village named Chunchuan without electricity or radios. At one point the village was attacked by bandits. No one knew in the USA of their whereabouts except family and a circle of scientists. In October 1952 Joan went public in Beijing attending the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference where she denounced Hiroshima. This launched a paranoid response in the USA that she was willing to assist China developing a nuclear bomb. Questions were asked about her of her brother William during the McCarthy hearings. In May 1955 the couple and their three young children moved to a farm near Xi'an during the period of the Great Leap Forward. In April 1966 the family moved to Beijing to work as translators and editors at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAfter 1956, Hinton finally obtained permanent residency to live in China and she chose to retain her US citizenship.\n\nOn August 29 (or in June, according to another source), 1966, Joan Hinton, Erwin Engst and two other Americans living in China—Bertha Sneck (\"Shǐ Kè\" 史克, who had previously been married to Joan's brother William) and Ann Tomkins (\"Tāngpǔjīnsēn\" 汤普金森)—signed a poster put up at the Foreign Experts Bureau in Beijing with the following text:\n\nWhich monsters and freaks are pulling the strings so foreigners get this kind of treatment? Foreigners working in China, no matter what class background they have, no matter what their attitude is toward the revolution, they all get the \"five nots and two haves\": the five nots—first: no physical labour, second: no thought reform, third: no chances of contacts with workers and peasants, fourth: no participation in class struggle, fifth: no participation in production struggle; the two haves—first: they have an exceptionally high living standard, second: they have all kinds of specialization. What kind of concept is that? This is Khrushchevism, this is revisionist thinking, this is class exploitation! [...] We demand: [...] Seventh: the same living standard and the same level of Chinese staff; eighth: no specialization any more. Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!\n\nA copy of the poster was shown to Mao Zedong, who issued a directive that \"revolutionary foreign experts and their children should be treated the same as the Chinese.\"\n\nIn 1972, Joan Hinton and Erwin Engst started working in agriculture again at the Beijing Red Star Commune.\n\nIn June 1987, William Hinton went to the town of Dazhai in Shanxi province to observe the changes brought about by the reform policies, and in August 1987, Joan Hinton stayed at Dazhai as well.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with CNN, after nearly 50 years in China, she stated \"[we] never intended to stay in China so long, but were too caught up to leave.\" Hinton described the changes she and her husband had witnessed in China since the beginning of the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s. They stated they \"have watched their socialist dream fall apart\" as much of China embraced capitalism. A 2004 MSNBC interviews noted her critical assessment of economic change as \"betrayals of the socialist cause.\" She noted what she describes as a rise of exploitation in Chinese society.\n\nHinton lived alone following the death of her husband in 2003. Her three children moved to the United States, with Hinton noting that \"They probably would have stayed if China were still socialist.\" Hinton retained her American citizenship, which she considered \"convenient for travel.\" Her son, Yang Heping (Fred Engst) moved back to Beijing in 2007 as a professor at the University of International Business and Economics.\n\nIn her 2005 essay \"The Second Superpower\", Hinton stated, \"There are two opposing superpowers in the world today: the U.S. on one side, and world public opinion on the other. The first thrives on war. The second demands peace and social justice.\"\n\nShe remained active in the small community of expats in Beijing, protesting against the war in Iraq.\n\nIn 1949, Hinton married Erwin Engst (1919–2003), a dairy-cattle expert, in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, China. Hinton had two sons, Bill and Fred Engst and a daughter, Karen Engst.\nIn 1923 Hinton's father checked himself into a clinic for treatment, but while there he committed suicide.\n\nOn June 8, 2010, Hinton died in Beijing, China. She was 88.\n\n\n\n"}

Smith and some of the leading quorums of his church publicly denied he taught or practiced it.\n\nIn 1852, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) acknowledged that Smith had practiced plural marriage and produced a written revelation of Smith's that authorizes its practice. Smith's son Joseph Smith III, his lawful widow Emma Smith, and most members of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) attempted for years to refute the evidence of plural marriages. They pointed to the historical record that Joseph Smith publicly opposed the practice of polygamy; the suggestion of the RLDS Church was that the practice of Mormon polygamy began in Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young.\n\nThe first publication of a list of women alleged to be Smith's plural wives was in 1887, by Andrew Jenson, an assistant church historian of the LDS Church. It included 27 women besides Emma Smith. Currently, there are 49 women on this list. However, historians disagree as to the number and identity of the plural wives which Smith had. Various scholars and historians, including Fawn M. Brodie, George D. Smith, and Todd Compton, have attempted to identify the women who married Smith. The discrepancy is created by the lack of documents to support some of the alleged marriages. As Compton has stated, for many of these marriages, \"absolutely nothing is known of [the] marriage after the ceremony.\" Apart from his marriage to Emma, Smith's marriages were not solemnized under any civil authority and were therefore solely religious unions.\n\nResearch by Ugo A. Perego, a geneticist and member of the LDS Church, has shown that a number of children of Smith's alleged polygamous relationships were not his genetic offspring. The following table lists some of the children born to Smith's alleged polygamous wives as well as those ruled out by genetic testing:\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first sitcom broadcast on a network television in the United States. \"Mary Kay and Johnny\" initially aired live on the DuMont Television Network before moving to CBS and then NBC.\n\nPlots centered around a bank employee and his \"zany, but not dumb\" wife and the problems that they encountered. Much of the activity occurred in the couple's apartment in Greenwich Village.\n\nA review in the March 6, 1948, issue of the trade publication \"Billboard\" began, \"This program comes close to being a model tele[vision] show. In detailing the adventures, mainly domestic, of a young married couple, Johnny and Mary Kay Stearns have come up with charming and fresh material, which always takes into consideration that there are cameras taking everything in.\" Later in the review, however, the author wrote, \"At times the show got just a bit too cute\" with the female star squealing too much and the story falling into familiar family sitcom patterns.\n\nIn addition to the Stearnses, the cast included their son, Christopher Stearns, as himself. Mary Kay's mother was played by Nydia Westman, and Johnny's friend Howie was played by Howard Thomas. Jim Stevenson was the announcer. \n\nThe first 15-minute episode debuted on the DuMont Television Network on Tuesday, November 18, 1947. The Stearnses created and wrote all the scripts. The program was broadcast live, most of the action taking place on a set representing the New York City apartment of the title characters, a young married couple. \n\n\"Mary Kay and Johnny\" was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman's pregnancy on television: Mary Kay became pregnant in 1948 and after unsuccessfully trying to hide her pregnancy, the producers wrote it into the show. On December 31, 1948, the Stearns' weeks-old son Christopher appeared on the show and became a character.\n\nAfter a year on DuMont, the show moved to CBS for half a year, much of the time being broadcast every weeknight, then ran for another year each Saturday night on NBC, where it debuted on October 10, 1948. It broadcast the final episode on March 11, 1950.\n\nAt a time when there were no TV ratings (the A.C. Nielsen Company would not begin measuring TV ratings until 1950), Anacin decided to take a chance and sponsor the show. This decision worried the advertising executives at Anacin, who thought that they might be wasting money by sponsoring a show with a sparse audience. A simple, non-scientific scheme to gauge the size of the audience was hatched. During one commercial spot, Anacin offered a free pocket mirror to the first 200 viewers who wrote in requesting one. As a precaution, they purchased a total of 400 mirrors in case the audience was twice as large as they expected. Although the free mirror was offered only during that one spot, Anacin received nearly 9000 requests for mirrors.\n\nBefore 1948, \"Mary Kay and Johnny\" was broadcast live and not recorded. In early 1948, still broadcast live, the show was also recorded on kinescopes so that it could be shown, with some delay, on the West Coast. The entire series from then until 1950 was recorded in this way.

{"id": "368048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368048", "title": "Middle name", "text": "Middle name\n\nIn several cultures, a middle name is a portion of a personal name that is written between the person's given name and their surname. A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a \"middle name\", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): \nIn the United States, such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, patronymics, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the \"middle name\" is often abbreviated to the middle initial (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for signatures) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.\n\nIt is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766).\n\nDespite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase \"middle name\" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical \"Harvardiana\".\n\nThe use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like María del Pilar Pereyra or María de las Nieves García.\n\nThe abbreviation \"N.M.N.\" (no middle name) or \"N.M.I.\" (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.\n\nSince 1905, \"middle name\" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase \"discretion is my middle name.\"\n\nIn countries that primarily speak English—such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage. In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.\n\nIn the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an initial, e.g. J. Edgar Hoover (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like Woodrow Wilson (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was Harry S. Truman. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)\n\nMore than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the \"upper classes\" and \"middle classes\". Examples are J. R. R. Tolkien, W.E.B. Du Bois, George H. W. Bush.\n\nMiddle names can also be used as first names. Major examples are Paul McCartney, Mitt Romney, Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, Sylvester Stallone, Jonathan Demme, Riley Keough, Reese Witherspoon, Hayley Orrantia, Brad Pitt, Ashton Kutcher, Meghan Markle, Rihanna, Scott Chandler, Nomar Garciaparra, Bill Mumy, Roger Waters and Jim Acosta.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (\"ming\"), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage. Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family. For example, the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty has the given name \"Yinzhen\" (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character \"Yin\" (胤). His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character \"Hong\" (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors. In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the One-child Policy, there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n\nA fading Chinese tradition is to use a courtesy name, called \"zì\" (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood. Traditionally \"zì\" is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old. This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect. Like the \"ming\", the \"zì\" is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the \"ming\". Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their \"zì\". An alternative courtesy name is the \"hào\" (; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A \"hào\" was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's \"míng\" or \"zì\"; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the \"hào\" to refer to themselves. The \"zì\" or \"hào\" can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.\n\nSome Chinese Americans move their Chinese given name (transliterated into the Latin alphabet) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. James Chu-yu Soong, Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang, and Michelle Wingshan Kwan. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with Cantonese names, such as Bruce Lee's middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.\n\nThe practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.\n\nIn Denmark and Norway, the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.\n\nIn the example Carl Viggo Manthey Lange, the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used patronymics until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician Lars Løkke Rasmussen has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.\n\nIn Sweden, the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called \"tilläggsnamn\" (additional name), and are called \"mellannamn\" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.\n\nFurthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish (\"mellannamn\") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the \"name of address\" (\"tilltalsnamn\")), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.\n\nOccasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.\n\nIn Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their \"name of address\" (\"tilltalsnamn\").\n\nTraditional middle names in Vietnamese are \"Văn\" for male names and \"Thị\" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially \"Thị\". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names (unisex names are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.\n\nFor Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used Spanish naming customs, that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle \"y\" (or \"e\", before \"i\"), which remains in use but became restricted to very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name \"Juan Santos Macaraig\", with \"Santos\" the middle name in the present order, may become \"Juan S. Macaraig\" with the middle name abbreviated, and \"Juan Macaraig y Santos\" in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official mug shots. The Philippine system, using \"given name-middle name-surname\" order (or \"Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname\") coincidentally follows the Portuguese naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.\n\nBut, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in \"Jose P. Laurel\", where \"P.\" (a middle initial) corresponds to \"Paciano\".\n\nIn illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. \n\nTo illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named \"Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala\" and \"Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada\", named '\"Maria Cristina'\", will be named \"Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz\" (or \"Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz\"), with Ana Cristina's middle name, \"dela Cruz\", as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname \"Lozada\", but keep the maternal surmame \"Manansala\" as middle name, thus, \"Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada\" (or \"Ma. Cristina M. Lozada\"). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called \"Maria Cristina Lozada\" or \"Ma. Cristina Lozada\", even when the mother is known.\n\nIn married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco\"), once marrying \"Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan\" (or \"Juan Pablo S. Marasigan\") may take the name \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco-Marasigan\"), maintaining the maternal surname \"Perez\", \"Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan\"), taking the maiden surname \"Limchauco\" as middle name and \"Marasigan\" as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco\" upon marriage.\n\nIn Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed \"segundo nombre\" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries..\n\nActually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4268523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4268523", "title": "Monte Melkonian", "text": "Monte Melkonian\n\nMonte Melkonian (classical ; reformed: Մոնթե Մելքոնյան; November 25, 1957 – June 12, 1993) was an Armenian revolutionary, left-wing nationalist militant and commander. He was the leader of an offshoot of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) in the 1980s and the most celebrated commander during the Nagorno-Karabakh War in the early 1990s.\n\nAn Armenian-American, Melkonian left the United States and arrived in Iran in 1978 during the beginning of the 1979 Revolution, taking part in demonstrations against the Shah. Following the collapse of the Shah's monarchy, he traveled to Lebanon during the height of the civil war and served in an Armenian militia group in the Beirut suburb of Bourj Hammoud. In ASALA, he took part in the assassinations of several Turkish diplomats in Europe during the early to mid-1980s. He planned the 1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris. He was later arrested and sent to prison in France. In 1989, he was released and in the following year, acquired a visa to travel to Armenia.\n\nMelkonian had no prior service record in any country's army before being placed in command of an estimated 4,000 men in the Nagorno-Karabakh War. He had largely built his military experience beginning from the late 1970s and 1980s, when he fought in Lebanon with ASALA. Melkonian fought against various factions in the Lebanese Civil War and against the IDF in the 1982 war.\n\nMelkonian carried several aliases over his career and was known as Avo to the troops under his command in Nagorno-Karabakh. The last years of his life were spent fighting with the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army. Monte was killed by Azerbaijani soldiers while surveying Merzili with five of his comrades in the aftermath of battle. He was buried at Yerablur cemetery in Yerevan and declared a National Hero of Armenia in 1996.\n\nMelkonian was born on November 25, 1957 at Visalia Municipal Hospital in Visalia, California to Charles (1918−2006) and Zabel Melkonian (1920−2012). He was the third of four children born to a self-employed cabinetmaker and an elementary-school teacher. By all accounts, Melkonian was described as an all-American child who joined the Boy Scouts and was a pitcher in Little League baseball. Melkonian's parents rarely talked about their Armenian heritage with their children, often referring to the place of their ancestors as the \"Old Country.\" His interest in his background only sparked at the age of eleven, when his family went on a year-long trip to Europe in 1969.\n\nWhile taking Spanish language courses in Spain, his teacher had posed him the question of where he was from. Dissatisfied with Melkonian's answer of \"California\", the teacher rephrased the question by asking \"where did your \"ancestors\" come from?\" His brother Markar Melkonian remarked that \"her image of us was not at all like our image of ourselves. She did not view us as the Americans we had always assumed we were.\" From this moment on, for days and months to come, Markar continues, \"Monte pondered [their teacher Señorita] Blanca's question \"Where are you from?\"\"\n\nIn the spring of that year, the family also traveled across Turkey to visit the town of Merzifon, where Melkonian's maternal grandparents were from. Merzifon's population at the time was 23,475 but was almost completely devoid of its once 17,000-strong Armenian population that was wiped out during the Armenian Genocide in 1915. They did find one Armenian family of the three that was living in the town, however, Melkonian soon learned that the only reason this was so, was because the head of the family in 1915 had exchanged the safety of his family in return for identifying all the Armenians in the town to Turkish authorities during the genocide. Monte would later confide to his wife that \"he was never the same after that visit...He saw the place that had been lost.\"\n\nUpon his return to California Monte returned to his education. In high school, he was exceeding all standards and having a hard time finding new academic challenges. Instead of graduating high school early, as was suggested by his principal, Monte found an alternative thanks to his father: a study abroad program in East Asia. At the age of 15 Monte traveled to Japan for a new chapter in his young life, namely to study martial arts and Japanese language. While there he began making money teaching English which helped finance his travels through several Southeast Asian countries. This introduced him to several new cultures, new philosophies, new languages, and in several cases, like his travels through Vietnam (just before the North would defeat the South), new skills that would become immensely valuable in his later life as a soldier. Returning to the United States, he graduated from high school and entered the University of California, Berkeley with Regents Scholarship, majoring in ancient Asian history and Archeology. In 1978 he helped to organize an exhibition of Armenian cultural artifacts at one of the university's libraries. The section of the exhibit dealing with the 1915-23 genocide was removed by university authorities, at the request of the Turkish consul general in San Francisco. The display that was removed was eventually reinstalled following a campus protest movement. Monte eventually completed his undergrad work in under three years. Upon graduating, he was accepted into the archeology graduate program at the University of Oxford. However, Monte chose to forgo this opportunity, and instead chose to begin his lifelong struggle for the Armenian Cause.\n\nAfter graduating from U.C. Berkeley in the spring of 1978, Monte traveled to Iran, where he taught English and participated in the movement to overthrow the Shah. He helped organize a teachers' strike at his school in Tehran, and was in the vicinity of Jaleh Square when the Shah's troops opened fire on protesters, killing and injuring many. Later, he found his way to Iranian Kurdistan, where Kurdish partisans made a deep impression on him. Years later, in southern Lebanon, he occasionally wore the uniform of the Kurdish peshmerga which he was given in Iranian Kurdistan.\n\nIn the fall of 1978, Monte made his way to Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, in time to participate in the defense of the Armenian quarter against the right-wing Phalange forces. Monte was affiliated with the Hunchakian socialist party and was a permanent member of the militia's bases in Bourj Hamoud, Western Beirut, Antelias, Eastern Beirut and other regions for almost two years, during which time he participated in several street battles against rightist forces. He also began working behind the lines in Phalangist controlled territory, on behalf of the \"Leftist and Arab\" Lebanese National Movement. By this time, he was speaking Armenian – a language he had not learned until adulthood (Armenian was the fourth or fifth language Monte learned to speak fluently, after Spanish, French and Japanese. In addition, he spoke passable Arabic, Italian and Turkish, as well as some Persian and Kurdish).\n\nIn the spring of 1980, Monte was inducted into the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, ASALA, and secretly relocated to West Beirut. For the next three years he was an ASALA militant and contributor to the group's journal, \"Hayastan\". During this time several Palestinian militant organizations provided their Armenian comrade with extensive military training. Monte carried out armed operations in Rome, Athens and elsewhere, and he helped to plan and train commandos for the \"Van Operation\" of September 24, 1981, in which four ASALA militants took over the Turkish embassy in Paris and held it for several days. In November 1981, French police arrested and imprisoned a young, suspected criminal carrying a Cypriot passport bearing the name \"Dimitri Georgiu.\" Following the detonation of several bombs in Paris aimed at gaining his release, \"Georgiu\" was returned to Lebanon where he revealed his identity as Monte Melkonian.\n\nIn mid-July 1983, ASALA violently split into two factions, one opposed to the group's despotic leader, whose nom de guerre was Hagop Hagopian, and another supporting him. Although the lines of fissure had been deepening over the course of several years, the shooting of Hagopian's two closest aides at a military camp in Lebanon finally led to the open breach. This impetuous action was perpetrated by one individual who was not closely affiliated with Monte. As a result of this action, however, Hagopian took revenge by personally torturing and executing two of Monte's dearest comrades, Garlen Ananian and Arum Vartanian.\n\nIn the aftermath of this split, Monte spent over two years underground, in Lebanon and later in France. After testifying secretly for the defense in the trial of Armenian militant and accused bank robber Levon Minassian, he was arrested in Paris in November 1985, and sentenced to six years in prison for possession of falsified papers and carrying an illegal handgun.\n\nMonte spent over three years in Fresnes and Poissy prisons. He was released in early 1989 and sent from France to South Yemen, where he was reunited with his girlfriend Seda. Together they spent year and a half living underground in various countries of eastern Europe in relative poverty, as one regime after another disintegrated.\n\nOn October 6, 1990 Monte arrived in what was then still Soviet Armenia. During the first 8 months in Armenia, Melkonian worked in the Armenian Academy of Sciences, where he prepared an archaeological research monograph on Urartian cave tombs, which was posthumously published in 1995.\n\nFinding himself on Armenian soil after many years, he wrote in a letter that he found a lot of confusion among his compatriots. Armenia faced enormous economic, political and environmental problems at every turn, problems that had festered for decades. New political forces bent on dismantling the Soviet Union were taking Armenia in a direction that Monte believed was bound to exacerbate the crisis and produce more problems. He believed that \"a national blunder was taking place right before his eyes.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances, it quickly became clear to Monte that, for better or for worse, the Soviet Union had no future and the coming years would be perilous ones for the Armenian people. He then focused his energy on Karabagh. \"If we lose [Karabagh],\" the bulletin of the Karabakh Defense Forces quoted him as saying, \"we turn the final page of our people's history.\" He believed that, if Azeri forces succeeded in deporting Armenians from Karabakh, they would advance on Zangezur and other regions of Armenia. Thus, he saw the fate of Karabagh as crucial for the long-term security of the entire Armenian nation.\n\nOn September 12 (or 14) 1991 Monte travelled to Shahumian region (north of Karabagh), where he fought for three months in the fall of 1991. There he participated in the capture of Erkej, Manashid and Buzlukh villages.\n\nOn February 4, 1992 Melkonian arrived in Martuni as the regional commander. Upon his arrival the changes were immediately felt: civilians started feeling more secure and at peace as Azeri armies were pushed back and were finding it increasingly difficult to shell Martuni's residential areas with GRAD missiles.\n\nIn April 1993, Melkonian was one of the chief military strategists who planned and led the operation to fight Azeri fighters and capture the region of Kalbajar of Azerbaijan which lies between the Republic of Armenia and former NKAO. Armenian forces captured the region in four days of heavy fighting, sustaining far fewer fatalities than the enemy.\n\nMonte was killed in the abandoned village of Merzili in the early afternoon of June 12, 1993 during the Battle of Aghdam. According to Markar Melkonian, Monte's older brother and author of his biography, Monte died in the waning hours of the evening by enemy fire during an unexpected skirmish that broke out with several Azerbaijani soldiers who had likely gotten lost.\n\nMonte was buried with full military honors on June 19, 1993 at Yerablur military cemetery in the outskirts of Yerevan, where his coffin was brought from the Surb Zoravar Church in the city center. Some 50,000 to 100,000 people (some reports put the figure as high as 250,000), including Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, acting Defense Minister Vazgen Manukyan, Deputy Foreign Minister Gerard Libaridian, government officials, and parliamentarians attended his funeral.\n\nThe Karabakh town of Martuni was renamed Monteaberd (or Monteapert; ; literally \"Fort Monte\").\n\nIn 1993 the Monte Melkonian Military Academy was established in Yerevan.\n\nMonte had become a legend in Armenia and Karabakh by the time of his death. Due to his international socialist and Armenian nationalist views, one author described him as a mix between the early 20th century Armenian military commander Andranik and Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Thomas de Waal described him as a \"professional warrior and an extreme Armenian nationalist\" who is \"the most celebrated Armenian commander\" of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Raymond Bonner wrote in 1993 that Monte had charisma and discipline, which is why he \"rapidly became the most highly regarded commander in the Karabakh War.\" Historian Razmik Panossian wrote that Monte was \"a charismatic and very capable commander.\" Armenia's Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan called Monte the most honest person in the world.\n\nMelkonian was an Armenian nationalist and a revolutionary socialist. Throughout his life he sympathized with Marxism–Leninism, which was also the ideology of ASALA. Vorbach wrote in 1994 that his writings \"expose him as an Armenian nationalist and a committed socialist of the Marxist-Leninist variety.\" According to his brother he \"had not always been a communist, but he had never been an \"ex\"-communist.\" Melkonian hoped that the Soviet Union would \"reform itself, democratize, and promote personal freedoms\" and did not abandon hope in Soviet Armenia until the end of the Soviet era appeared inevitable. Philip Marsden wrote that his career \"reveals the profound shift in radical ideology—from revolutionary Marxism to nationalism.\" Marsden adds that in the 1980s his ideology came into conflict with a growing nationalism: \"With ever greater difficulty, he squeezed the Armenian question into the context of left-wing orthodoxy, believing for instance that Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union would be a terrible error.\" In the 1980s he advocated for the Soviet takeover of Turkey's formerly Armenian populated areas and its unification with Soviet Armenia. In the 1980s, while in a French prison, he called for the creation of a guerilla force in eastern Turkey which would unite Kurdish rebels, left-wing Turks, and Armenian revolutionaries. Vorbach summarized his views on Turkey:\n\nBy the early 1990s he saw Karabakh as a \"sacred cause\". He is quoted as saying, \"If we lose Karabakh, we turn the final page of our people's history.\"\n\nMonte was also an internationalist. In an article titled \"Imperialism in the New World Order\" he declared his support for socialist movements in Palestine, South Africa, Central America and elsewhere. He also espoused environmentalism from an anti-capitalist perspective. According to one author his economic views were influenced by the Beirut-based Armenian Marxist economist Alexander Yenikomshian.\n\nMaile Melkonian, Monte's sister wrote in response to David Rieff's 1997 article in \"Foreign Affairs\" that Melkonian was never associated with and was not a supporter of the views of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaks).\n\nAccording to Vorbach Melkonian had become an atheist at the time of his revolutionary activities.\n\nRaymond Bonner wrote that Monte was said to have led an exemplary life by not smoking and drinking. Monte is widely known to have forbidden his soldiers consumption of alcohol. He also established a policy of collecting a tax in kind on Martuni wine, in the form of diesel and ammunition for his fighters.\n\nMonte Melkonian married his long-time girlfriend Seda Kebranian at the Geghard monastery in Armenia in August 1991. They had met in the late 1970s in Lebanon. In a 1993 interview Monte said that they had had no time to start a family. He stated, \"We'll settle down when the Armenian people's struggle is over.\"\n\nAs of 2013 Seda, an activist and a lecturer, resided in Anchorage, Alaska with her husband Joel Condon who is a professor of architecture at the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\nsources:\n\n\n\n"}

After graduating from the Gymnasium in Trikala, he studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He then went on to work as a lawyer in Larissa. He was a devoted Aromanian nationalist and became an early member of the Communist Party of Greece, even becoming a member of its central committee before being expelled from it in 1926. He then returned to Larissa where he was active in Ioannis Sofianopoulos's Agrarian Party.\n\nWith the beginning of the Axis occupation of Greece, Matussis reestablished his links with Alcibiades Diamandi whom he had first met in 1920. Together they founded the Aromanian separatist state of the Principality of the Pindus, spanning from Thessaly to Epirus and Macedonia, and encompassing all Vlach populated areas within Greece. Matussis, Demosthenes Tsoutras and Konstantinos Tahas confounded the Italian-sponsored Vlach \"Roman Legion\" which became the state's official military force. In 1942, after Diamandi suddenly left Greece to go to Romania, Matussi became leader of the so-called Roman Legion. Then, when the Legion collapsed since their Italian supporters left and were replaced by the Germans and the Greek resistance grew more active, he went to Athens, where his attempt to court the German occupational authorities failed and he was denied a cabinet seat in the government of the Hellenic State. Having abandoned his ambitions of a Vlach state, he founded a pro-German collaborationist organization Organization of Pioneers of New Europe (OPNE). In late 1943 or early 1944, he followed Diamandi's footsteps, fleeing to Romania.\n\nFollowing King Michael's Coup, the Romanian Communist Party seized power in the country, sentencing Matussis to 20 years in prison on a Danube island. In 1964, following his requests and also the request of the Greek government, he was released to the hands of Greek authorities, who put him to prison and took him to court, accused of treason (like several members of the \"Roman Legion\" in the courts just after the war in 1945–1947). In this court (which took place in Athens, far from Larissa where he was active) and with the support of defense witnesses he was declared innocent of war crimes. In 1976 his civil rights were completely restored by a Greek court. He subsequently lived in Athens, Loutraki and from 1966 in Larissa where he died in 1991.\n\nIn 1920, he married Sofia Balodimou (-1984). Together they had a daughter Xeni (Polyxeni), painter (1927 – 28 September 1985).\n"}
{"id": "1299203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1299203", "title": "Papa Haydn", "text": "Papa Haydn\n\nThe composer Joseph Haydn is sometimes given the nickname \"Papa\" Haydn. The practice began in Haydn's lifetime and has continued to the present day. \n\nHöslinger (2009) identifies three senses of the term, discussed below in the order of their chronological origin.\n\n\"Papa Haydn\" started out as a term of affection bestowed on Haydn by the musicians who worked for him. After 1766 Haydn was the Kapellmeister at the Esterházy court, presiding over a fairly large group of musicians. His authority was evidently rather benevolent, as he often interceded with Prince Esterházy on behalf of musicians who had gotten in trouble. The tale of the \"Farewell\" Symphony attests to Haydn's willingness to act on behalf of his subordinates. The practice of calling Haydn \"Papa\" became increasingly plausible as Haydn's 30-plus years of service in the Eszterházy court went by; with each year, he would have become increasingly older than the average musician serving under him.\n\nAs time went by, the group of musicians who called Haydn \"Papa\" expanded beyond the Esterházy court and included Haydn's friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nHöslinger summarizes this aspect of \"Papa Haydn\" thus: \"'Papa' arose as a term of affection, commonly used by the Esterházy players ... for a father figure, somebody who willingly gave advice and who was generally respected as a musician.\" He notes that in Haydn's time the term was used for other musicians as well; e.g. \"Franz Schubert called Salieri his 'Grosspapa' (German: 'grandad')\".\n\nAnother sense of the term \"Papa Haydn\" came from his role in the history of classical music, notably in the development of the symphony and string quartet. While Haydn did not invent either genre, his work is considered important enough that the labels \"Father of the Symphony\" and \"Father of the String Quartet\" are often attached to him. Even in his own lifetime, this perspective was prevalent. In 1797, the Tonkünstler-Societät of Vienna passed the resolution to make him a life member, \"by virtue of his extraordinary merit as the father and reformer of the noble art of music.\" When in 1798 Franz Niemetschek published a biography of Mozart, he dedicated the book to Haydn, calling him \"father of the noble art of music and favorite of the Muses.\"\n\nHöslinger asserts that this usage of \"Papa Haydn\" increased during the 19th century, \"as the sense of reverence for older composers increased.\"\n\nThis usage, which arose in the 19th century, is characterized thus by Höslinger: it is \"a more patronizing, even dismissive one. In comparison with Romantic artists and Romantic music, Haydn and his output were seen as genial, but naive and superficial.\"\n\nWith the rise of acclaim for Haydn's music during the 20th century, the patronizing sense of \"Papa Haydn\" caused scholars and critics to become leery of the term, seeing it as a distortion of the composer's work. For example, Haydn scholar Jens Peter Larsen wrote (1980):\n\nBecause music education materials still tend to reflect 19th-century sources, the patronizing sense of \"Papa Haydn\" is well known to musicians, reflected in conventionalized, bewigged portraits of the composer (see right), or in the lyrics of the rhyme below, commonly taught to children (it is sung to the first bars of the second movement of the \"Surprise Symphony\"):\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">\nPapa Haydn's dead and gone\nWhen his mood was one of bliss\n\n"}

Brown\n\nPatrick \"Pat\" O'Reilly Brown, (born 1954) is chief executive and founder of Impossible Foods Inc. and professor emeritus in the department of biochemistry at Stanford University. Brown is co-founder of the Public Library of Science, inventor of the DNA microarray, and a former investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nBrown received each of his degrees from the University of Chicago, including his B.S. in 1976 and M.D. in 1982. His Ph.D., granted in 1980 while under the guidance of Nicholas R. Cozzarelli, involved the study of DNA topoisomerases.\n\nAfter getting his medical degree in 1982, Brown completed a 3-year pediatric residency at Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago but decided he could have a greater impact through basic research. In 1985, Brown took a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship at University of California, San Francisco with J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus (who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discoveries about how genes can ignite cancerous tumors). At UCSF, Brown and colleagues defined the mechanism by which retroviruses, such as the AIDS virus, integrate their genes into the genome of the cells they infect, which helped lead to development of new drugs to fight the disease.\n\nIn 1988, Brown became an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he continued to investigate retroviral replication. In the early 1990s, Brown began developing a new technology to enable systematic investigation of the behavior and properties of whole genomes—called DNA microarrays. \"I had a mental image of a DNA microarray, even including the red and green fluorescent spots, a few years before I'd figured out the details of making them,\" Brown told The Scientist.\n\nBrown and his colleagues created a robotic dispenser that could deposit minute quantities of tens of thousands of individual genes onto a single glass slide, a “DNA microarray” or \"gene chip.\" By flooding the slide with fluorescently labeled genetic material derived from a living sample, a researcher could see which genes were being expressed in cells. Shortly after their first description of DNA microarrays, the Brown laboratory published a “how-to” manual on the Web that helped these robotic devices become standard equipment in life science labs throughout the world.\n\nBrown and his colleagues developed experimental methods for using DNA microarrays to investigate basic principles of genome organization, gene expression, cell regulation and specialization, physiology, development and disease, and the microbiome, along with statistical and computational tools for visualizing and interpreting the resulting large volumes of data. Microarray technologies are widely used for comparing gene expression patterns and other genome features among individuals and their tissues and cells, providing information on disease subcategories, disease prognosis, and treatment outcome.\n\nStarting in the late 1990s, Brown began publicly voicing concern over what he called \"a fundamentally flawed process of scientific publishing,\" in which academics typically published results of publicly funded research in private, commercial publishing houses that charged subscription fees for access to journals. “We viewed this entire process as being patently unfair. Not only were scientists in poor countries being denied access to the latest and best information out there, but the public who supports this research was being denied access as well. We felt there simply had to be a better way to do it,\" Brown told a University of Chicago medical journal.\n\nBrown began a collaboration with other scientists, including Harold Varmus (then director of the National Institutes of Health), David J. Lipman (then director of the National Center for Biotechnology Information), and Michael Eisen of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to overhaul the scientific and medical publishing systems to make papers available on the rapidly developing Internet platforms such as Usenet and the World Wide Web. \"Why should publishers be able to control what I can do with information that was published by my scientific colleagues whose motivation was exactly to have their discoveries contribute to future discoveries? ... We had already existing tools that we could use to so to speak hyperlink things so that you could reorganize information in systematic ways, but they weren't really being exploited by the conventional scientific literature,\" Brown said in an interview with BioMedCentral Biology. The magazine Nature reported that the scientists' open-access movement could \"spell the end for many print titles\"; Brown called subscription-based scientific journals \"anachronisms.\"\n\nIn 2001, Brown, Eisen and Varmus co-founded the Public Library of Science (PLOS) to make published scientific research open access and freely available to researchers in the scientific community. Funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the non-profit organization advocated for designing alternative systems to fund for scientific publishing.\n\nIn 2002, Brown was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences, identifying him as one of the top 2000 scientists in the nation. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nIn 2009, Brown took an 18-month sabbatical where he considered how to spend the rest of his career. Brown decided that the world's largest environmental problem, and the problem where he could have the most impact, was the use of animals to produce food. He organized a conference to raise awareness of the problem. But the National Research Council workshop, called \"The Role of Animal Agriculture in a Sustainable 21st Century Global Food System,” had minimal impact; soon after, he decided the best way to reduce animal agriculture was to offer a competing product in the free market.\n\nBy the end of his sabbatical, Brown had articulated the first steps of his business plan and began to recruit a small team of scientists to determine precisely why meat smells, handles, cooks and tastes like meat. Brown said he had a \"hunch\" that the key to meat's unique taste was its high abundance of heme, an iron-containing molecule in blood that carries oxygen and is found in all living organisms. Brown theorized that, if he could generate large amounts of heme from plant sources, he could recreate the taste of animal meat.\n\nBrown and a small group of early employees tested the hunch by digging up clover roots, which for the plant kingdom contain high amounts of heme. \"I dissected them off with a razor blade then blended them up just to see what I could extract. I was just poking around, feasibility-testing some ideas. I got to a point where, though I didn’t have much data, I’d enough to go and talk to some venture-capital companies — of which there are a ridiculous number in Silicon Valley — and hit them for some money,” Brown told The Sunday Times. Brown raised a Series A round of $9 million from Khosla Ventures and founded Impossible Foods in July 2011. Brown and his team spent five years researching and developing the Impossible Burger, which launched in restaurants in 2016. Impossible Foods is also working on plant-based pork, chicken, fish and dairy products made without any animals.\n\nIn 2000, Brown received the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology.\n\nIn 2002 he received a Takeda award, recognizing his work in \"the development of DNA microarrays with pre-synthesized DNA probes and the promotion of the technology by releasing the production methods on the Internet.\"\n\nIn 2005 he received the Curt Stern Award for his contributions to the development and application of gene-based expression microarrays.\n\nIn 2006 he received the American Cancer Society's Medal of Honor for Basic Research, acknowledging \"his revolutionary development of low-cost, accessible automated microarrays, and his life-saving contributions to the field of functional genomics...which in turn has produced insights into critical genetic information for diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and early stage breast cancer.\"\n\nIn 2010 the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) selected Brown for the ABRF 2010 Award in recognition of Brown's pioneering work in the development of microarrays and the diverse applications of this technology in genetic research.\n\nIn 2016, the Geneva, Switzerland-based World Economic Forum named Brown a Technology Pioneer for his design, development and deployment of new technologies and innovations \"poised to have a significant impact on business and society.\"\n"}

His music is strongly influenced by his native Brittany, the landscape of which is reflected in most of his work.\n\nBefore World War I, Le Flem produced several major works, including his First Symphony, a Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra, and an opera. The war temporarily put an end to his compositional activities, and in its aftermath he devoted himself to music criticism and choral conducting. He wrote numerous articles for the periodical \"Comoedia\".\n\nIn 1937, he began composing once again. Three additional symphonies and a second opera followed before he was finally forced to give up composition in 1976, at the age of 95, due to blindness. He died on 31 July 1984 at the age of 103.\n\nSome of his dramatic works include the operas \"Le Rossignol de St-Malo\" (The Nightingale of St Malo) and \"La Magicienne de la mer\" (The Magician of the Sea), as well as a version of the chante-fable \"Aucassin et Nicolette\". \"For the Dead\" and the seven \"Pièces enfantines\", both originally written in 1911, were orchestrated some years later. Two of the composer's children died young, and \"For the Dead\" is dedicated to their memory. In addition to his symphonies, Le Flem wrote evocative orchestral music such as \"En mer\" (At Sea) and \"La Voix du large\" (The Voice of the Open Sea). Le Flem also composed the music for Jean Tedesco's short film \"The Great Gardener of France\" in 1942.\n\nLe Flem was a member of the Association des Compositeurs Breton; another member, the Irish-American Swan Hennessy (1866–1929) dedicated his \"Petit trio celtique\", Op. 52 (1921) to Le Flem.\n\nPaul Le Flem, with his wife, Jeanne (Even), was the grandfather of actress Marika Green and great-grandfather of actress Eva Green by his daughter, Jeanne, who married Swedish journalist Lennart Green.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his faith-healing movement and initiated the \"One God, One Nation movement\" in India.\n\nR. Paulaseer Lawrie was born to father, Deva Rasiah, and mother, Nesammal, at the Lakshmi Tea Estate in Munnar, Kerala.\nSoon after his birth, the family moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Paulaseer stayed back to study at St. John's College, located in Palayamkottai, Tamil Nadu. After finishing the intermediate class of university studies, he went to Ceylon and studied commercial subjects for one year. He then went to Wesley College, Colombo, located in Colombo to gain the London Matric certificate.\n\nAfter this, he went back to Madras, Tamil Nadu, and joined the Christian College, located in Tambaram, Tamil Nadu, for a Bachelor of Arts degree. As World War II began, a vigorous recruiting for officers was afoot. Paulaseer wanted to join the Indian Army and took some training. On knowing this, his father came over and forced Paulaseer to return with him to Ceylon. Paulaseer came back to India to continue his studies. He got a seat in St. Xavier's College, located in Palayamkottai, Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn August 1942, when the national leaders launched the Quit India Movement, he organized a big student strike in his college. The police attempted to apprehend him, but he managed to escape to Ceylon where, soon after arrival, he got a job in one of the tea estates as a stenographer. Around this time Paulaseer began to read political and religious works and to have visions. In 1946, he went to India on a short holiday. While going with his mother to a friend's house, he saw everything according to the dreams he had had about his wife-to-be. The church, the road, the house and its inmates and every detail flashed back in great vividness. Thus assured that the girl in that house was the one chosen by the Lord, he consented to marry, and they were engaged. His mother was there, but his father was in Ceylon. So the marriage had to be postponed for six months; it occurred 26 May 1947.\n\nWhen his first child was seriously ill, Paulaseer prayed in an Anglican church and promised to devote his life to God if the child recovered. After his son's recovery, he resigned his job in Ceylon and returned to India. He took a job on the Yercaud Estate, located in Tamil Nadu, and later at the Christian Medical College Hospital, (CMCH)located in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn response to more visions, Paulaseer resigned his job in 1953 in order to preach. He participated in a Bombay healing crusade of American evangelist William M. Branham in 1954, an acquaintance that was to be important later. A series of \"miracles\" sparked interest in Paulaseer's message. After preaching in various towns in South India, he crossed over to Ceylon on two missionary journeys. The first tour lasted from 25 October 1955 to 20 December 1955. The second longer tour was from 8 April 1956 until 17 June 1956.\n\nAfter several years of evangelizing in India, Paulaseer was invited to an international conference in Scotland. From Scotland he went to the United States, where he attempted to acquire backing from an established Pentecostal ministry. This was largely unsuccessful until he met with Branham, who encouraged him in his ministry.\n\nIn 1960s, his group gave refuge to the expelled CPM/TPM leader Alwin R. De Alvis. Together they conducted meetings in Vepery, Chennai. Later on when Alwin R. De Alvis started exercising authority over the entire group, Paulaseer left the group and started a new gathering of his followers in a larger hall called Jubilee Hall.\n\nIn 1967, Paulaseer took a long journey in the West, preaching to many of Branham's followers. In 1969 he took another tour, and this time some Branhamites experienced extraordinary things from his preaching. On 21 July 1969 the day of the Apollo 11 moon landing Paulaseer claimed to have become the second coming of Christ. His followers pointed to Branham's sermons to show that he recognized Paulaseer as such. Paulaseer adopted from Branham a prediction that the Rapture would occur in 1977, and that only 700 would be saved. Many American followers abandoned Paulaseer after his predictions for that year failed to come true.\n\nIn the 1980s, Paulaseer changed his message somewhat, teaching \"Aadhi Bali\" or \"Supreme Sacrifice\" an idea from the Purusasukta. He began to draw much more on Hindu and even Muslim ideas, and attracted more native Indian followers.\n\n"}

He was the standard-bearer of \"Aksyon Demokratiko\", which he founded in 1997 as a vehicle for his presidential bids in 1998 and 2004. He was a former senator and the Secretary of the Department of Education under the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He had a strong following among young voters in the Philippines, due to his efforts to promote honesty and good governance.\n\nRoco was married to Sonia Cubillo Malasarte, who is from Bohol. They have six children (Robbie Pierre, Raul Jr., Sophia, Sareena, Rex and Synara) and seven grandchildren (Nica, Reece, Samantha, Shania, Santina, Beannie and RB).\n\nRaúl Roco was born in Naga City in the Philippine province of Camarines Sur, the son of farmer Sulpicio Azuela Roco and public school teacher Rosario Orlanda Sagarbarria.\n\nRoco finished elementary school at age 10 from Naga Parochial School, and high school at age 14 from Ateneo de Naga. He graduated \"magna cum laude\" from San Beda College in Manila with a degree in English at the age of 18. Then, he was also the Editor-in-Chief of The Bedan working with the likes of Rene Saguisag and Jaime Licauco. Later, Roco received a Bachelor of Laws degree (also at San Beda College) and was the college's Abbott Awardee for Over-All Excellence. In the United States, he obtained his Master of Laws at the University of Pennsylvania, while also enrolled at the Wharton School.\n\nHe was the president of the National Union of Students of the Philippines in 1961 and was named one of the Ten Outstanding Students of the Philippines in 1964. His wife Sonia was the Most Outstanding Student that same year.\n\nAs a result of his various other achievements, he had been awarded seven honorary doctorates.\n\nAfter he passed the bar in 1965, Roco lobbied for the holding of a Constitutional Convention that aimed to amend the 1935 Philippine Constitution. He campaigned for a seat to represent his district in Camarines Sur. He won and thus became convention's youngest Bicolano delegate.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, he served as president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. While there, he was on the legal staff of the late Philippine Senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, and he drafted the Study Now, Pay Later law.\n\nAlongside his work in law, he has also served as a film producer. In 1974, he was the executive producer of the late film director Lino Brocka's movie \"Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang\"; this film won six FAMAS awards that year, including best film.\n\nAmong all legislators of the Eighth Congress of the Philippines (which lasted from 1987–1992), he was adjudged by the Ford Foundation and the University of the Philippines Institute of Strategic and Development Studies as first in over-all performance.\n\nRoco was elected to the Senate in 1992 and 1995 serving until 2001, making many contributions that led many to recognize him as an \"outstanding senator\". He wrote the law which reformed the nation's banking system; this earned him the title \"Father of the Bangko Sentral\". Some other laws that he wrote resulted in the liberalization of the banking industry and the strengthening of the thrift banks. In addition, he wrote the Intellectual Property Code and the Securities Regulation Code.\n\nRoco has also made several contributions to education in the Philippines. He helped fund the teachers’ cooperatives as well as the increment mandated by the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers for retiring public school teachers. On the students’ side, he helped bring computers into Philippine universities, colleges, and public schools. In addition, he devised a plan for meal scholarships for poor students at the Philippine Normal University.\n\nRoco wrote several bills targeted at protecting and prioritizing women in the Philippines. He wrote the Women in Nation Building Law, the Nursing Act, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, the Anti-Rape Law, and the Child and Family Courts Act. He also let women play major roles in the Department of Education’s literacy program. Out of thanks to his services for women, many women's groups named him an \"Honorary Woman\".\n\nHe also drafted a bill that abolished double taxation on Filipinos working abroad.\n\nHe was given the Bantay Katarungan award by Kilosbayan for playing an integral role in the Senate impeachment trial of then-president Joseph Estrada who was impeached by the House of Representatives on 2000 for graft and corruption. bribery, betrayal of public trust and culpable violation of the Philippine Constitution. Unfortunately, the impeachment trial was not concluded and on 2001, Estrada was ousted from power by another People Power uprising.\n\nRoco took over as education secretary of the Philippines in 2001, at a time when the Philippines had not only one of the ten most corrupt governments in the world (according to Transparency International), but its Department of Education was also the fourth-most corrupt of its agencies (as named by the Asia Foundation - Social Weather Stations Survey of Enterprises on Public Sector Corruption). To combat this corruption, Roco imposed a department-wide transparency policy which also held employees accountable for the purchase of textbooks, which had been a major source of the department's corruption. This allowed the department to purchase textbooks for a much lower price, and after just eight months under Roco's leadership, the Department of Education gained a 73% public approval rating and became the most trusted government agency in the Philippines.\n\nDuring his tenure in that position, Roco allowed free public education (through high school) as required by the Philippine Constitution. He also enacted a reform of basic education curriculum in order that children would focus their studies on reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and Makabayan. In addition, he made sure that teachers were paid promptly and ended the 3% \"service fee\" that the department had long been deducting from teachers' pay.\n\nRoco ran for president in the 1998 Philippine election. He lost to Vice-President Joseph Estrada but had a remarkable showing in a field of eleven candidates despite being an independent candidate. His strong showing was attributed to the widespread support he received from young Filipinos who eventually formed his party, Aksyon Demokratiko, and its youth arm, Aksyon Kabataan. Party leaders then included Jaime Galvez Tan, Lorna Patajo-Kapunan and Darwin Mariano.\n\nRoco rode his success in the Department of Education into a run for the Philippine presidency. His candidacy was based on his ability to fight corruption and to display fair play, decency, and honor. His Aksyon Demokratiko party formed a coalition with Promdi and Reporma, the parties of 1998 presidential candidates Lito Osmeña and Renato de Villa, to form the \"Alyansa ng Pag-asa\" (Alliance of Hope).\n\nRoco was a front-runner in pre-election surveys and was considered a strong contender. However, during the campaign, he battled with [recurrence of his cancer], after remission from his bout with prostate cancer in 1996. His illness forced him to leave the campaign trail for medical attention in the United States.

A \"Top-10\" spin-off mini-series also called \"Smax\" focused on the character and provided him with more of a backstory. In advertisements and interviews leading up to the release of the first issue, the series was referred to as \"Smax the Adventurer\".\n\nJeff Smax (born Jaafs Macksun) is a gigantic, blue-skinned, white-haired, super-powered, demi-ogre policeman who lives and works at Precinct 10, in a city populated by \"science-heroes\". Smax originally hailed from a land based on fantasy myth and fairy tale legends, but had left after a horrifying failure during his career as a dragon slayer.\n\nSmax is both extremely strong, and invulnerable to most forms of harm, including radiation. Smax is often fairly gruff and guarded amongst his peers, mostly due to the frequent loss of loved ones he has experienced in life (most notably his dear friend and late partner, Stochastic Fats). Though at first very hesitant to become friendly with his new partner, Robyn Slinger AKA \"Toybox\", he eventually begins to bond with her, even feeling a great need to protect her when she is attacked by Commissioner Ultima and buried under precinct station rubble. The pair are not romantically involved, however, as Smax has an intimate relationship with his twin sister, Rexa. This is not an unusual situation in Smax's home dimension, which has far different laws of physics and science. Rexa, eventually comes to live with Smax and the details of their unique relationship is only known to Robyn, who keeps it secret.\n\nSmax is fairly resourceful in the line of duty, but he has a quick temper and is not intellectually inclined, often not thinking things through. Smax has experience using weaponry, including his Singing Sword, but he most often prefers using his fist, or his Strong Light energy (which emanates from his solar plexus). \n\nThe story deals with Smax and Toybox returning, via magical teleportation, to Jeff's magically enchanted homeworld. Smax, now a city dweller, seems embarrassed by his unsophisticated, sword-and-sorcery roots. They attend Smax's uncle's funeral where Jeff introduces Robyn as his wife, though no such relationship exists. At this point Jeff's sister Rexa Macksun is introduced, dressed in the typical garb of a female fantasy barbarian such as Red Sonja and just as tall and physically impressive as her brother with the same blue skin and white hair. \n\nIt is revealed Jeff has been away from home for some time, having originally left his world fleeing personal and literal demons. Once a great dragon slayer, a job needed to pay the bills for his adopted dwarven family, Smax fails to stop an extremely powerful, shape-shifting dragon named Morning Bright from destroying a little girl. She was burned to ashes in front of him, forever leaving a white burnmark of a hand on his chest. \n\nFurther story developments reveal a sexual tension between Smax and his sister. The two were born of an unwilling union between a monster and a human warrior woman with magical strength. Despite this, the pressure of twins kills her during childbirth. Her durability is passed on to her children. Their monstrous father would abuse them both and molest the sister, who would also find love and solace in her brother's arms. Smax would eventually kill his father so they could escape together. Though in their medieval homeworld their relationship wasn't particularly frowned upon, Smax developed conflicted feelings about the propriety of their love.\n\nFor various reasons, Smax, Rexa, Robyn, and other heroes venture out to destroy Morning Bright. Smax's heroic efforts cause the mark on his chest to be removed.\n\nThe \"Smax\" miniseries was written by Alan Moore, and pencilled by Zander Cannon, who also inked the first issue. Andrew Currie inked the rest of the miniseries. The title of each issue's story is a line from the Syd Barrett song \"Octopus\". \nThe series was collected into a hardcover edition () in 2004 and in paperback () on November 2, 2005.\n\n\n"}

Born in Madiun, East Java, the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), he studied at Gadjah Mada University, Cornell University and in 1963 graduated with an MA from Yale University. His debut as a writer came early with the publication of \"Simphoni\" (Symphony), a collection of poems, in 1957. The collection has been described as \"cynical, untamed poetry, shocking sometimes\". \"Simphoni\" was followed by several attempts at short story writing, including the publication \"Kedjananan di Sumbing\" (Manhood on Mount Sumbing), before Subagio settled on poetry as his main creative outlet. Following an extended stay in the United States he published a collection of poems entitled \"Saldju\" (Snow) in 1966. The poems in this collection deal with questions of life and death, and of the need for \"something to hold on to in an existence threatened on all sides\", and have been described as altogether more restrained than those in his earlier work. Additional works published since 1966 include \"Daerab Perbatasan\" (Border Region) (1970), \"Keroncong Motinggo\" (Montinggo's Song) (1975), \"Buku Harian\" (Diary), \"Hari dan Hara\" (1979)\"Simphoni Dua\" (1990), and several books of literary criticism. Subagio's collected poems have been published as \"Dan Kematian Makin Akrab\" (1995).\n\nFrom 1958 to 1961 Subagio taught in the Faculty of Letters at Gadjah Mada University.\nHe was able to read French, Dutch and English with sufficient fluency to be able to translate poems in these languages into Indonesian, and this allowed him to find employment abroad. He spent several years teaching in Australia, firstly as a senior lecturer at Salisbury College of Advanced Education and from 1974 to 1981 he lectured at Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia. He also acted as guest instructor at Ohio University, teaching Indonesian. In 1981 he became a member of the Working Group on Socio-Cultural Defense and the Director of Young PN Hall Book Publishing, and from 1982 to 1984 he was a member of the Jakarta Arts Council. For many years, he was a director of Balai Pustaka, a publishing firm in Indonesia. In 1987, Subagio Sastrowardoyo, together with Goenawan Mohamad, Sapardi Djoko Damono, Umar Kayam, and John H. McGlynn, established the Lontar Foundation, a non-profit organization with the primary aim of promoting Indonesian literature and culture through the translation of Indonesian literary works.\n\nSubagio Sastrowardoyo died in Jakarta on 18 July 1995.\n\n\n A few years ago, [John] McGlynn's foundation collected Indonesians' impressions of the United States, many of them unsettling, in a book called \"On Foreign Shores.\" One of the poets, Ajip Rosidi, reacted to New York in a poem titled \"Manhattan Sonnet.\"\n\n\"Is it within these strong and rigid walls /\none's sense of safety nestles? /\nAll I find here is vigilance, the source of apprehension.\"\n\nHis compatriot Subagio Sastrowardoyo wrote about a city \"where life is cheap.\" New York's greed, he said, \"has made this place too confined for prayer or a human voice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDs\n"}

Sullivan\n\nWilliam Healy Sullivan (October 12, 1922 – October 11, 2013) was an American Foreign Service career officer who served as Ambassador to Laos from 1964–1969, the Philippines from 1973–1977, and Iran from 1977–1979.\n\nSullivan was born in Cranston, Rhode Island, and graduated from Brown University as salutatorian and Class Orator of the class of 1943. His senior address was on America's duty to \"aid in repairing not only the damage suffered by our Allies, but also that sustained by our enemies.\" After graduation, he entered the Navy and served as a gunnery officer on a destroyer, the \"USS Hambleton\". The \"Hambleton\" escorted North Atlantic convoys, and served off North Africa and Italy before participating in the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the invasion of Okinawa. He had the senior watch on the Hambleton when it entered Yokohama harbor for the Japanese surrender.\n\nAfter obtaining a joint graduate degree from Harvard University and the Fletcher School at Tufts University under the GI Bill, Sullivan joined the Foreign Service and was posted to Bangkok, Thailand. During that tour, he was in brief communication with the Viet Cong, who were in exile in northern Thailand. His subsequent assignments were to Calcutta, India, Tokyo, Japan, Naples and Rome, Italy, and The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nHis habit of speaking his mind with force and candor grated on more than one superior, and for years he languished in the lower grades. Then, in the Kennedy administration, he was assigned to the office of W. Averell Harriman, the Assistant Secretary for the Far East. Harriman, no admirer of blandness, immediately recognized his abilities.\n\nSullivan served as Harriman's deputy at Geneva negotiations about the future of Laos in 1961 and during the Cuban Missile Crisis. When the Vietnam War heated up, he served briefly as deputy chief of mission to the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.\n\nHis nephew is United States Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.\n\nIn 1964, Sullivan began his tenure as Ambassador to Laos. During his service in Laos, Sullivan broached negotiations with the North Vietnamese, capitalizing on his prior contacts with the Viet Cong in Thailand nearly 20 years previously, for the initiation of the Paris Peace Talks that ended the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Pursuant to an order by President Kennedy, all U.S. military operations in Laos were under the direct supervision of the Ambassador. As Ambassador to Laos during Project 404, and he also personally directed the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh trail. This civilian control and the restriction on military operations rankled the military. \nAfter he left Laos, Sullivan returned to Washington to coordinate the U.S. participation in the Paris Peace Talks. Thereafter, he was appointed Ambassador to the Philippines. South Vietnam fell while he in the Philippines, and Sullivan orchestrated the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people through that nation. He was able to convince President Marcos to permit the fleeing South Vietnamese navy to land, despite a demand from the new Communist Vietnamese government for its return, by arguing that the ships were in fact U.S. property after the fall of the South Vietnamese government, as a result of the terms of their sale to that state.\n\nSullivan next served as U.S. Ambassador to Iran, arriving just before President Jimmy Carter's visit to the Shah of Iran in December 1977. In the 1970s, America had extremely close military and economic links with Iran. However, in early 1978, growing unrest due to inflation and other economic hardships fueled by the growing tide of fundamentalist Islam led to demonstrations against the Shah. During the next year, however, as the domestic situation in Iran was rapidly unraveling, Washington had few instructions for the Embassy in Iran.\n\nAs the demonstrations increased in scale, Sullivan came into conflict with National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski over a resolution that would be acceptable to American interests. Sullivan felt that compromise with the demonstrators and the Ayatollah Khomeini was necessary, while Brzezinski favored strong, unconditional support for the Shah and Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar. Although Brzezinski got his way, the demonstrators prevailed; in late 1978, Sullivan cabled Washington that it might be necessary to consider policy options if the military proved unable to assure the shah's continuance in power and the shah should depart from Iran. In January 1979, the White House instructed Sullivan to inform the shah that the U.S. government felt he should leave the country.\n\nOn February 1, 1979, the exiled Khomeini returned to Tehran. Days later, with Tehran in revolution and all organs of state essentially nonexistent, Under Secretary of State David D. Newsom called from the White House Situation Room with a question for Sullivan: \"The National Security Advisor (Brzezinski) has asked for your view of the possibility of a coup d'état by the Iranian military to take over from the Bakhtiar government, which is clearly faltering.\"\n\nSullivan allegedly replied, \"Tell Brzezinski to fuck off.\"\n\n\"That's not a very helpful comment,\" Newsom noted.\n\n\"You want it translated into Polish?\" Sullivan hung up.\n\nOn February 14, 1979, the US Embassy in Teheran was overrun by several different armed groups. The Embassy staff was briefly taken hostage, but later released to the caretaker Iranian government.\n\nHe wrote in his autobiography: \"I had recommended that we accept the fact that a revolution was in progress and seek to use our not inconsiderable influence to steer its success toward its more moderate protagonists.\" This view, however, was not shared by Washington, and Sullivan was recalled in March 1979. Shortly after, on April 1, 1979, Iran officially became an Islamic Republic.\n\nAfter Sullivan left Iran, the Embassy drew down to a skeleton staff, under the direction of Chargé d'Affaires Bruce Laingen, who later became one of 52 Americans held hostage by militant Iranian students. \n\nHe headed the American Assembly at Columbia University, which had been briefly headed by General Dwight Eisenhower before he was elected President, from 1979 to 1986. In 1981, Sullivan published Mission to Iran, a memoir of his time as ambassador. His autobiography, \"Obbligato: Notes on a Foreign Service Career\", was published in 1984.\n\nHe later served on the boards of the Lincoln Center, the International Center, and the U.S.- Vietnam Trade Council.\n\nIn 1988 he received an overture to begin steps towards U.S.-Vietnam normalization from his former North Vietnamese negotiations counterpart Nguyen Co Thach, who had become Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Sullivan first traveled back to Vietnam in May 1989 to meet with Minister Thach, founded the U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council, and from then continued to work on steps towards the historic normalization.\n\nFollowing retirement, he lived a quiet life in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and later, Washington, D.C.\n\nWilliam H. Sullivan died on October 11, 2013, one day before his 91st birthday. He is survived by 4 children and 6 grandchildren.\n\n"}

In 1842, he was elected a member of the Académie française, and in the same year was created a duke by Louis-Philippe.\n\nBorn in Paris in a family of the \"noblesse de robe\", with ancestors such as Étienne Pasquier, he was destined for the legal profession and was educated at the \"Collège de Juilly\" near Paris. He then became a counsellor of the \"parlement de Paris\", and witnessed many of the incidents that marked the growing hostility between that body and Louis XVI of France in the years preceding the French Revolution of 1789.\n\nHis views were those of a moderate reformer, determined to preserve the House of Bourbon in a renovated France; his memoirs depict in a favorable light the actions of his \"parlement\" (an institution soon to be abolished towards the end of the year 1789, under growing revolutionary pressures).\n\nFor some time, and especially during the Reign of Terror (1793–1794), Pasquier remained in obscurity; but this did not save him from arrest nor his father from execution in the year 1794. He was incarcerated for two months in the Saint-Lazare Prison shortly before the start of Thermidorian Reaction, and released after the fall and execution of Maximilien Robespierre at the end of July 1794.\n\nHe did not re-enter the public service until the period of the First French Empire, when the arch-chancellor Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès used his influence with Napoleon I to procure for him the office of \"maître des requêtes\" to the Conseil d'État. In 1809, he became baron of the Empire, and in February 1810 counsellor of State. In October 1810, the Emperor made him prefect of police of Paris.\n\nThe main challenge of his career was the strange conspiracy of the republican general Claude François de Malet (October 1812); Malet, spreading false news that Napoleon had died in the Russian campaign, managed to surprise and capture some of the ministers and other authorities in Paris, among them Pasquier. However, the attempt's manifest failure enabled Pasquier to speedily regain his liberty.\n\nWhen Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, Pasquier continued to exercise his functions for a few days in order to preserve order, and then resigned from the prefecture of police, whereupon Louis XVIII of France allotted to him the \"Corps des Ponts et Chaussées\". He distanced himself from the Imperial restoration at the time of the Hundred Days (1815), and, after the final Bourbon Restoration, became Keeper of the Seal (July 1815). Finding it impossible to work with the Ultra-royalists of the Chamber of Deputies (the \"Chambre introuvable\"), he resigned office in September. Under the more moderate ministers of succeeding years, he again held various appointments, but refused to join the reactionary cabinets of the close of the reign of Charles X of France.\n\nAfter the July Revolution (1830), he became president of the Chamber of Peers a post which he held through the whole of the reign of Louis-Philippe (1830–1848). After the abdication of Louis-Philippe in February 1848, \"Chancelier Pasquier\" retired from active life and set to work to compile the notes and reminiscences of his long and active career. He died in Paris at the age of ninety-five on 5 July 1862.\n\n"}
