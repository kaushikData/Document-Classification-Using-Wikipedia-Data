{"id": "13041163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13041163", "title": "Adele", "text": "Adele\n\nAdele Laurie Blue Adkins (; born 5 May 1988) is an English singer and songwriter. After graduating from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards \"Critics' Choice\" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008 poll. Her debut album, \"19\", was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK, and three times platinum in the US. The album contains her first song, \"Hometown Glory\", written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of West Norwood in London. An appearance she made on \"Saturday Night Live\" in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nAdele released her second studio album, \"21\", in 2011. The album was critically well received and surpassed the success of her debut, earning numerous awards in 2012, among them a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; two Brit Awards, including British Album of the Year; and three American Music Awards. The album has been certified 17 times platinum in the UK, and is overall the fourth best-selling album in the nation. In the US, it has held the top position longer than any album since 1985, and is certified diamond. The best-selling album worldwide of 2011 and 2012, \"21\" has sold over 31 million copies. The success of \"21\" earned Adele numerous mentions in the \"Guinness Book of World Records.\" She was the first female artist to simultaneously have two albums in the top five of the \"Billboard\" 200 and two singles in the top five of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 as well as the first woman in the history of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 to have three simultaneous top 10 singles as a lead artist with \"Rolling in the Deep\", \"Someone Like You\", and \"Set Fire to the Rain\", all of which also topped the chart. \"21\" is the longest-running number one album by a female solo artist in the history of the UK and US Album Charts.\n\nIn 2012, Adele released \"Skyfall\", which she co-wrote and recorded for the James Bond film of the same name. The song won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, as well as the Brit Award for British Single of the Year. After taking a three-year break, Adele released her third studio album, \"25\", in 2015. It became the year's best-selling album and broke first-week sales records in the UK and US. \"25\" was her second album to be certified diamond in the US and earned her five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, and four Brit Awards. The lead single, \"Hello\", became the first song in the US to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release. Her third concert tour, Adele Live 2016, visited Europe, North America and Oceania, and concluded with finale concerts at Wembley Stadium in late June 2017.\n\nIn 2011, 2012, and 2016, Adele was named Artist of the Year by \"Billboard\". At the 2012 and 2016 Ivor Novello Awards, Adele was named Songwriter of the Year by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2012, she was listed at number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music. \"Time\" magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world in 2012 and 2016. Her 2016–17 tour saw her break attendance records in a number of countries, including the UK, Australia and the US. With sales of more than 100 million records, Adele is one of the world's best-selling music artists.\n\nAdele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on 5 May 1988 in Tottenham, London, to an English mother, Penny Adkins, and a Welsh father, Marc Evans. Evans left when Adele was two, leaving her mother to raise her. She began singing at age four and asserts that she became obsessed with voices. Growing up, Adele spent most of her time singing rather than reading; the last book she read was Roald Dahl's \"Matilda\" when she was six years old. In 1997, at the age of nine, Adele and her mother, who by then had found work as a furniture maker and an adult-learning activities organiser, relocated to Brighton on the south coast of England.\n\nIn 1999 she and her mother moved back to London; first to Brixton, then to the neighbouring district of West Norwood in south London.\nAdele graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon in May 2006, where she was a classmate of Leona Lewis and Jessie J. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent even though, at the time, she was more interested in going into A&R and hoped to launch other people's careers.\n\nFour months after graduation, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication \"PlatformsMagazine.com.\" She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, boss of the music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting.\n\nNick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, \"My Yvonne,\" for his debut album, and it was during this session she first met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce both the majority of her debut album, \"19,\" and tracks on \"21.\" In June 2007, Adele made her television debut, performing \"Daydreamer\" on the BBC's \"Later... with Jools Holland\". Adele's breakthrough song, \"Hometown Glory\", was released in October 2007.\n\nBy 2008, Adele had become the headliner and performed an acoustic set, in which she was supported by Damien Rice. She became the first recipient of the Brit Awards \"Critics' Choice\" and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. The album \"19,\" named for her age at the time she wrote and composed many of its songs, entered the British charts at number one. \"The Times\" \"Encyclopedia of Modern Music\" named \"19\" an \"essential\" blue-eyed soul recording. She released her second single, \"Chasing Pavements\", on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, \"19\". The song reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks. Adele was nominated for a 2008 Mercury Prize award for \"19\". She also won an Urban Music Award for \"Best Jazz Act.\" She also received a Q Awards nomination in the category of Breakthrough Act and a Music of Black Origin nomination in the category of Best UK Female. In March 2008, Adele signed a deal with Columbia Records and XL Recordings for her foray into the United States. She embarked on a short North American tour in the same month, and \"19\" was released in the US in June. \"Billboard\" magazine stated of it: \"Adele truly has potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" The An Evening with Adele world tour began in May 2008 and ended in June 2009.\nShe later cancelled the 2008 US tour dates to be with a former boyfriend. She said in \"Nylon\" magazine in June 2009, \"I'm like, 'I can't believe I did that.' It seems so ungrateful... I was drinking far too much and that was kind of the basis of my relationship with this boy. I couldn't bear to be without him, so I was like, 'Well, I'll just cancel my stuff then.'\" She referred to this period as her \"early life crisis\". She is also known for her dislike of flying and bouts of homesickness when away from her native London. By the middle of October 2008, Adele's attempt to break in America appeared to have failed. But then she was booked as the musical guest on 18 October 2008 episode of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live.\" The episode, which included an expected appearance by then US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, earned the program its best ratings in 14 years with 17 million viewers. Adele performed \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Cold Shoulder,\" and the following day, \"19\" topped the iTunes charts and ranked at number five at Amazon.com while \"Chasing Pavements\" rose into the top 25. The album reached number 11 on the \"Billboard\" 200 as a result, a jump of 35 places over the previous week.\nIn November 2008 Adele moved to Notting Hill, London after leaving her mother's house, a move that prompted her to give up drinking. The album was certified gold in February 2009 by the RIAA. By July 2009, the album had sold 2.2 million copies worldwide.\n\nAt the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in February 2009, Adele received the award for Best New Artist, in addition to the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Chasing Pavements\", which was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Adele performed \"Chasing Pavements\" at the ceremony in a duet with Jennifer Nettles. In 2010, Adele received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Hometown Glory.\" In April her song \"My Same\" entered the German Singles Chart after it had been performed by Lena Meyer-Landrut in the talent show contest \"Unser Star für Oslo,\" or \"Our Star for Oslo,\" in which the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was determined.\nIn late September, after being featured on \"The X Factor,\" Adele's version of Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love\" re-entered the UK singles chart at number 4. During the 2010 \"CMT Artists of the Year\" special, Adele performed a widely publicised duet of Lady Antebellum's \"Need You Now\" with Darius Rucker. This performance was later nominated for a CMT Music Award.\n\nAdele released her second studio album, \"21\", on 24 January 2011 in the UK and 22 February in the US. She said that the album was inspired by the break-up with her former partner. The album's sound is described as classic and contemporary country and roots music. The change in sound from her first album was the result of her bus driver playing contemporary music from Nashville when she was touring the American South, and the title reflected the growth she had experienced in the prior two years. Adele told \"Spin Magazine:\" \"It was really exciting for me because I never grew up around [that music].\" \"21\" hit number 1 in 30 countries, including the UK and the US.\n\nAn emotional performance of \"Someone Like You\" at the 2011 Brit Awards on 15 February propelled the song to number one in the UK. Her first album, \"19,\" re-entered the UK album chart alongside \"21,\" while first and second singles \"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Someone Like You\" were in the top 5 of the UK singles chart, making Adele the first living artist to achieve the feat of two top-five hits in both the Official Singles Chart and the Official Albums Chart simultaneously since The Beatles in 1964. Both songs topped the charts in multiple markets and broke numerous sales performance records. Following her performance of \"Someone Like You\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, it became Adele's second number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. By December 2011, \"21\" sold over 3.4 million copies in the UK, and became the biggest-selling album of the 21st century, overtaking Amy Winehouse's \"Back to Black\", with Adele becoming the first artist ever to sell three million albums in the UK in one calendar year. \"Set Fire to the Rain\" became Adele's third number one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, as Adele became the first artist ever to have an album, \"21,\" hold the number-one position on the \"Billboard\" 200 concurrently with three number one singles. Moreover, \"21\" had the most weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart of any album by a woman.\n\nTo promote the album, Adele embarked upon the \"Adele Live\" tour, which sold out its North American leg. In October 2011, Adele was forced to cancel two tours because of a vocal-cord haemorrhage. She released a statement saying she needed an extended period of rest to avoid permanent damage to her voice. In the first week of November 2011 Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, performed laser microsurgery on Adele's vocal cords to remove a benign polyp. A recording of her tour, \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall,\" was released in November 2011, debuting at number one in the US with 96,000 copies sold, the highest one-week tally for a music DVD in four years, becoming the best-selling music DVD of 2011. Adele is the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history to have the year's number-one album (\"21\"), number-one single (\"Rolling in the Deep\"), and number-one music video. At the 2011 American Music Awards on 20 November, Adele won three awards; Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Album for \"21.\" On 9 December, \"Billboard\" named Adele Artist of the Year, \"Billboard\" 200 Album of the Year (\"21\"), and the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Song of the Year (\"Rolling in the Deep\"), becoming the first woman ever to top all three categories.\nFollowing the throat microsurgery, she made her live comeback at the 2012 Grammy Awards in February. She won in all six categories for which she was nominated, making her the second female artist in Grammy history, after Beyoncé, to win that many categories in a single night. Following that success, \"21\" achieved the biggest weekly sales increase following a Grammy win since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking data in 1991. Adele received the Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, and British Album of the Year presented to her by George Michael. Following the Brit Awards, \"21\" reached number one for the 21st non-consecutive week in the UK. The album has sold over 4.5 million copies in the UK where it is the fourth best-selling album. In October, the album's sales surpassed 4.5 million in the UK, and in November it surpassed 10 million sales in the US. The best-selling album worldwide of 2011 and 2012, , the album has sold over 31 million copies. By the end of 2014, she had sold an estimated 40 million albums and 50 million singles worldwide. Adele is the only artist or band in the last decade in the US to earn an RIAA diamond certification for a one disc album in less than two years.\n\nIn October 2012, Adele confirmed that she had been writing, composing and recording the theme song for \"Skyfall,\" the twenty-third James Bond film. The song \"Skyfall,\" written and composed in collaboration with producer Paul Epworth, was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and features orchestrations by J. A. C. Redford. Adele stated recording \"Skyfall\" was \"one of the proudest moments of my life.\" On 14 October, \"Skyfall\" rose to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart with sales of 92,000 copies bringing its overall sales to 176,000, and \"Skyfall\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 8, selling 261,000 copies in the US in its first three days. This tied \"Skyfall\" with Duran Duran's \"A View to a Kill\" as the highest-charting James Bond theme song on the UK Singles Chart; a record surpassed in 2015 by Sam Smith's \"Writing's on the Wall\".\n\n\"Skyfall\" has sold more than two million copies worldwide and earned Adele the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In December 2012, Adele was named \"Billboard\" Artist of the Year, and \"21\" was named Album of the Year, making her the first artist to receive both accolades two years in a row. Adele was also named top female artist. The Associated Press named Adele Entertainer of the Year for 2012. The 2013 Grammy Awards saw Adele's live version of \"Set Fire to the Rain\" win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance, bringing her total wins to nine.\n\nOn 3 April 2012, Adele confirmed that her third album would likely be at least two years away, stating, \"I have to take time and live a little bit. There were a good two years between my first and second albums, so it'll be the same this time.\" She stated that she would continue writing and composing her own material.\nAt the 2013 Grammy Awards, she confirmed that she was in the very early stages of her third album. She also stated that she will most likely work with Paul Epworth again.\n\nIn September 2013, Wiz Khalifa confirmed that he and Adele had collaborated on a song for his upcoming fifth studio album, \"Blacc Hollywood,\" though the collaboration did not make the final track listing. In January 2014, Adele received her tenth Grammy Award with \"Skyfall\" winning Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. On the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a cryptic message via her Twitter account which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, \"Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year,\" was interpreted by some in the media, including the \"Daily Mail\" and Capital FM, as meaning that her next album would be titled \"25\" and released later in the year. In 2014, Adele was nominated for nine World Music Awards. In early August, Paul Moss suggested that an album would be released in 2014 or 2015. However, in the October 2014 accounts filed with Companies House by XL Recordings, they ruled out a 2014 release.\nOn 27 August 2015, \"Billboard\" reported that Adele's label, XL Recordings, had intentions of releasing her third studio album sometime in November 2015. Danger Mouse has contributed a song, while Tobias Jesso Jr. has written a track, and Ryan Tedder is \"back in the mix after producing and co-writing \"Rumour Has It\" on \"21\".\" At the 72nd Venice International Film Festival in early September 2015, Sia announced that her new single \"Alive\" was co-written by Adele, and had originally been intended for Adele's third album. On 18 October, a 30-second clip of new material from Adele was shown on UK television during a commercial break on \"The X Factor\". The commercial teases a snippet from a new song from her third album, with viewers hearing a voice singing accompanied by lyrics on a black screen.\n\nIn a statement released three days later she confirmed that the album is titled \"25\", with Adele stating, \"My last record was a break-up record, and if I had to label this one, I would call it a make-up record. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. \"25\" is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened.\" Adele also believes \"25\" will be her last album with her age as its title, believing that \"25\" would be the end to a trilogy. On 22 October, Adele confirmed that \"25\" would be released on 20 November, while the lead single from the album, \"Hello\" would be released on 23 October. The song was first played on Nick Grimshaw's \"Radio 1 Breakfast Show\" on the BBC on the morning of 23 October with Adele interviewed live. The video of \"Hello\", released on 22 October, was viewed over 27.7 million times on YouTube in its first 24 hours, breaking the Vevo record for the most views in a day, surpassing the 20.1 million views for \"Bad Blood\" by Taylor Swift. On 28 October, BBC News reported that \"Hello\" was being viewed on YouTube an average one million times an hour. \"Hello\" went on to become the fastest video to hit one billion views on YouTube, which it achieved after 88 days. The video for \"Hello\" captured iconic British elements such as a red telephone box and a cup of tea. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 30 October, with first week sales of 330,000 copies, making it the biggest-selling number one single in three years. \"Hello\" also debuted at number one in many countries around the world, including Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland and Germany, and on 2 November, the song debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the first song in the US to sell at least one million downloads in a week, setting the record at 1.11 million. By the end of 2015, it had sold 12.3 million units globally and was the year's 7th best-selling single despite being released in late October.\nOn 27 October, BBC One announced plans for \"Adele at the BBC\", a one-hour special presented by Graham Norton, in which Adele talks about her new album and performs new songs. This was her first television appearance since performing at the 2013 Academy Awards ceremony, and the show was recorded before a live audience on 2 November for broadcast on 20 November, coinciding with the release of \"25\". On 27 October it was also announced that Adele would appear on the US entertainment series \"Saturday Night Live\" on 21 November. On 30 October, Adele confirmed that she would be performing a one-night-only concert titled \"Adele Live in New York City\" at the Radio City Music Hall on 17 November. Subsequently, NBC aired the concert special on 14 December.\n\nOn 27 November, \"25\" debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the fastest selling album in UK chart history with over 800,000 copies sold in its first week. The album debuted at number one in the US where it sold a record-breaking 3.38 million copies in its first week, the largest single sales week for an album since Nielsen began monitoring sales in 1991. \"25\" also broke first week sales records in Canada and New Zealand. \"25\" became the best-selling album of 2015 in a number of countries, including Australia, the UK and the US, spending seven consecutive weeks at number one in each country, before being displaced by David Bowie's \"Blackstar\". It was the best-selling album worldwide of 2015 with 17.4 million copies sold. \"25\" has since sold 20 million copies globally. Adele's seven weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart took her total to 31 weeks at number one in the UK with her three albums, surpassing Madonna's previous record of most weeks at number one for a female act.\n\nIn November 2015, Adele's 2016 tour was announced, her first tour since 2011. Beginning in Europe, Adele Live 2016 included four dates at the Manchester Arena in March 2016, six dates at the O2 Arena, London, with further dates in Ireland, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands among others. Her North American Tour began on 5 July in St. Paul, Minnesota. The leg included six nights at Madison Square Garden in New York City, eight nights at Staples Center in Los Angeles, and four nights at Air Canada Centre in Toronto. Adele broke Taylor Swift's five-show record for most consecutive sold-out shows at Staples Center.\nAt the 2016 Brit Awards in London on 24 February, Adele received the awards for British Female Solo Artist, British Album of the Year for \"25\", British Single of the Year for \"Hello\", and British Global Success, bringing her Brit Award wins to eight. She closed the ceremony by performing \"When We Were Young\", the second single from \"25\". Two more singles from \"25\" were released in 2016: \"Send My Love (To Your New Lover)\" and \"Water Under the Bridge\". While on stage at London's O2 Arena on 17 March, Adele announced that she would be headlining on the Pyramid Stage at the 2016 Glastonbury Festival, which was later confirmed by the festival's organisers. She appeared for a 90-minute fifteen song set at the festival on 25 June, and described the experience as \"by far, the best moment of my life so far\".\n\nAs part of her world tour, in February and March 2017, Adele performed in Australia for the first time, playing outdoor stadiums around the country. Her first two shows in New Zealand sold out in a record-breaking 23 minutes, and a third show was announced, with all tickets sold in under 30 minutes. Adele sold over 600,000 tickets for her record-breaking eight date Australian tour, setting stadium records throughout the country; her Sydney show at ANZ Stadium on 10 March was seen by 95,000 people, the biggest single concert in Australian history, a record she broke the following night with more than 100,000 fans.\nAdele completed her world tour with two concerts, dubbed \"The Finale\", at Wembley Stadium, London on 28 and 29 June. She announced the shows at \"the home of football\" by singing the England football team's \"Three Lions\" anthem and also the theme song to the BBC's weekly Premier League football show \"Match of the Day\". Adele had added another two concerts at Wembley after the first two dates sold out, however she cancelled the 1 and concert of 2 Julys after damaging her vocal cords. As a show of support, fans instead gathered outside Wembley Stadium to perform renditions of her songs, in an event titled \"Sing for Adele\".\n\nAt the end of 2016, \"Billboard\" named Adele Artist of the Year for the third time, with the Top \"Billboard\" 200 album. \"25\" was the best-selling album for a second consecutive year in the US. With 160 million views, Adele's Carpool Karaoke through the streets of London with James Corden, a sketch which featured on Corden's talk show \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" in January 2016, was the biggest YouTube viral video of 2016. At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2017, Adele won all five of her nominations, bringing her to fifteen. She won awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for \"25\", and Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Hello\". She also performed a tribute to the late George Michael singing the rendition of his song \"Fastlove\"; due to technical difficulties which occurred during the performance, Adele decided to stop and restart, explaining \"I can't mess this up for him\". On June 25, 2018, it had been reported that Adele is working on her fourth studio album, which is slated for a December 2019 release.\n\nAdele has cited the Spice Girls as a major influence in regard to her love and passion for music, stating that \"they made me what I am today\". Adele impersonated the Spice Girls at dinner parties as a young girl. She stated she was left \"heartbroken\" when her favourite Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell aka \"Ginger Spice\", left the group. She has also stated that growing up, she listened to Sinéad O'Connor, The Cure, Dusty Springfield, Celine Dion, and Annie Lennox.\nOne of Adele's earliest influences was Gabrielle, who Adele has admired since the age of five. During Adele's school years, her mother made her an eye patch with sequins which she used to perform as the Hackney born star in a school talent contest. After moving to south London, she became interested in R&B artists such as Aaliyah, Destiny's Child, and Mary J. Blige. Adele says that one of the most defining moments in her life was when she watched Pink perform at Brixton Academy in London. She states: \"It was the \"Missundaztood\" record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live […] I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible.\"\nIn 2002, aged 14, Adele discovered Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald as she stumbled on the artists' CDs in the jazz section of her local music store. She was struck by their appearance on the album covers. Adele states she then \"started listening to Etta James every night for an hour,\" and in the process was getting \"to know my own voice.\" Adele credits Amy Winehouse and her 2003 album \"Frank\" for inspiring her to take up the guitar, stating, \"If it wasn't for Amy and \"Frank\", one hundred per cent I wouldn't have picked up a guitar, I wouldn't have written \"Daydreamer\" or \"Hometown [Glory]\" and I wrote \"Someone Like You\" on the guitar too.\" She also states that her mother, who is very close to her, exposed her to the music of Aaliyah, Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige, and Alicia Keys, all of whom inspired her as well. She is also a fan of Lana Del Rey, Britney Spears, Grimes, Chvrches, FKA Twigs, Alabama Shakes, Kanye West, Rihanna, Frank Ocean, and Stevie Nicks. In 2017, she described Beyoncé as a particular inspiration, calling her \"my artist of my life\" and added \"the other artists who mean that much to me are all dead.\" Adele cited Madonna's album \"Ray of Light\" as a \"chief inspiration\" behind her album \"25\".\n\nAdele's first album, \"19\", is of the soul genre, with lyrics describing heartbreak and relationship. Her success occurred simultaneously with several other British female soul singers, with the British press dubbing her a new Amy Winehouse. This was described as a third British Musical Invasion of the US. However, Adele called the comparisons between her and other female soul singers lazy, noting \"we're a gender, not a genre\". AllMusic wrote that \"Adele is simply too magical to compare her to anyone.\"\n\nHer second album, \"21\", shares the folk and soul influences of her debut album, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008–09 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of Adele's separation from her partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness. Having referred to \"21\" as a \"break-up record\", Adele labelled her third studio album, \"25\", a \"make-up record\", adding it was about \"Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did.\" Her yearning for her old self, her nostalgia, and melancholy about the passage of time, is a feature of \"25\", with Adele stating, \"I've had a lot of regrets since I turned 25. And sadness hits me in different ways than it used to. There's a lot of things I don't think I'll ever get 'round to doing.\"\n\nAdele is a mezzo-soprano with a range spanning from C to B. However Classic FM state she is often mistaken for a contralto due to the application of a tense chest mix to achieve her lower notes, whilst also noting that her voice becomes its clearest as she ascends the register, particularly from C to C. \"Rolling Stone\" reported that following throat surgery her voice had become \"palpably bigger and purer-toned\", and that she had added a further four notes to the top of her range. Initially, critics suggested that her vocals were more developed and intriguing than her songwriting, a sentiment with which Adele agreed. She has stated: \"I taught myself how to sing by listening to Ella Fitzgerald for acrobatics and scales, Etta James for passion and Roberta Flack for control.\"\n\nHer voice has received acclaim from critics. In a review of \"19\", \"The Observer\" said, \"The way she stretched the vowels, her wonderful soulful phrasing, the sheer unadulterated pleasure of her voice, stood out all the more; little doubt that she's a rare singer\". BBC Music wrote, \"Her melodies exude warmth, her singing is occasionally stunning and, ...she has tracks that make Lily Allen and Kate Nash sound every bit as ordinary as they are.\" For their reviews of \"21\", \"The New York Times\" chief music critic Jon Pareles commended Adele's emotive timbre, comparing her to Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark, and Annie Lennox: \"[Adele] can seethe, sob, rasp, swoop, lilt and belt, in ways that draw more attention to the song than to the singer\". Ryan Reed of \"Paste\" magazine regarded her voice as \"a raspy, aged-beyond-its-years thing of full-blooded beauty\", while MSN Music's Tom Townshend declared her \"the finest singer of [our] generation\".\nAdele began dating charity entrepreneur and Old Etonian Simon Konecki in the summer of 2011. In June 2012, Adele announced that she and Konecki were expecting a baby. Their son Angelo was born on 19 October 2012. On the topic of becoming a parent, Adele observed that she \"felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn't\". Adele and Konecki brought a privacy case against a UK-based photo agency that published intrusive paparazzi images of their son taken during family outings in 2013. Lawyers working on their behalf accepted damages from the company in July 2014. Adele has also stated that she has suffered from postnatal depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and panic attacks.\n\nIn early 2017, tabloids started speculating that Adele and Konecki had secretly married when they were spotted wearing matching rings on their ring fingers. During her acceptance speech at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Adele confirmed their marriage by calling Konecki her husband when thanking him. She subsequently clarified her marital status in March 2017, telling the audience at a concert in Brisbane, Australia, \"I'm married now\".\n\nPolitically she is a supporter of the Labour Party, stating in 2011 that she was a \"Labour girl through and through\". In 2015, Adele stated \"I'm a feminist, I believe that everyone should be treated the same, including race and sexuality\". In 2017, Adele was ranked the richest musician under 30 years old in the UK and Ireland in the \"Sunday Times Rich List\", which valued her wealth at £125 million. She was ranked the 19th richest musician overall.\n\nShe is an icon for the LGBT community. On 12 June 2016 an emotional Adele dedicated her show in Antwerp, Belgium to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, earlier that day, adding \"The LGBTQ community, they're like my soul mates since I was really young, so I'm very moved by it.\" In April 2018 it was widely reported that Adele had become an ordained minister in order to officiate at close friend comedian Alan Carr's wedding to Paul Drayton, something which Adele herself subsequently confirmed. The wedding, held in January 2018, took place in the garden of her house in Los Angeles. However, the news prompted Tim Worstall of \"The Continental Telegraph\" to observe that ordination in itself would not have allowed Adele to conduct the marriage under California law, and that she would have needed to apply to become a \"one-time deputy marriage commissioner\", a role similar to that of a Justice of the peace and known as becoming a \"JP for a day\": \"It’s certainly a cute story that Adele is now the Rev Miss Adele but it’s not really what happened.\"\n\nAdele has performed in numerous charity concerts throughout her career. In 2007 and 2008 she performed at the Little Noise Sessions held at London's Union Chapel, with proceeds from the concerts donated to Mencap which works with people with learning disabilities.

In February 2009, Adele performed at the 2009 MusiCares charity concert in Los Angeles. In 2011 and 2012, Adele donated autographed items for auctions to support MusiCares. When on tour, Adele requires all backstage visitors to donate a minimum charitable contribution of US$20 for the UK charity SANDS, an organisation dedicated to \"supporting anyone affected by the death of a baby and promoting research to reduce the loss of babies' lives\". During the UK and European leg of her Adele Live tour, she collected US$13,000 for the charity.\n\nOn 15 June 2017, Adele attended a vigil in west London for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire where, keeping a low profile, she was only spotted by a small handful of fans. Four days later she appeared at Chelsea fire station and brought cakes for the firefighters. Station manager Ben King stated \"She came in, came up to the mess and had a cup of tea with the watch and then she joined us for the minute’s silence.\" Paying tribute to the victims at her first Wembley show on 28 June, Adele encouraged fans to donate money to help the victims of the blaze rather than waste the money on \"overpriced wine\".\n\nAt the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele won awards in the categories of Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. She was also nominated in the categories of Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The success of her debut album \"19\" saw Adele nominated for three Brit Awards in the categories of Best British Female, Best British Single and Best British Breakthrough Act. Then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sent a thank-you letter to Adele that stated \"with the troubles that the country's in financially, you're a light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nAdele's second album, \"21\", earned her a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; two Brit Awards, including British Album of the Year. The success of the album saw her receive numerous mentions in the \"Guinness Book of World Records.\" With 21 non-consecutive weeks at number 1 in the US, Adele broke the record for the longest number-1 album by a woman in \"Billboard\" history, beating the record formerly held by Whitney Houston's soundtrack \"\". \"21\" spent its 23rd week at number one in March 2012, making it the longest-running album at number one since 1985, and it became the fourth best-selling album of the past 10 years in the US.

On 6 March, \"21\" reached 30 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Australian ARIA Chart, making it the longest-running number one album in Australia in the 21st century, and the second longest-running number one ever.\n\nIn February 2012, Adele was listed at number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music.

Adele topped the 2012 \"Sunday Times Rich List\" of musicians in the UK under 30 and made the Top 10 of \"Billboard\" magazine's \"Top 40 Money Makers\". \"Billboard\" also announced the same day that Adele's \"Rolling in the Deep\" is the biggest crossover hit of the past 25 years, topping pop, adult pop and adult contemporary charts and that Adele is one of four female artists to have an album chart at number one for more than 13 weeks (the other three artists being Judy Garland, Carole King, and Whitney Houston).\n\nAt the 2012 Ivor Novello Awards in May, Adele was named Songwriter of the Year, and \"Rolling in the Deep\" won the award for Most Performed Work of 2011.

Adele's seven weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart took her total to 31 weeks at number one in the UK with her three albums, surpassing Madonna's previous record of most weeks at number one for a female act in the UK. The lead single, \"Hello\", became the first song in the US to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release. At the 2016 Ivor Novello Awards Adele was named Songwriter of the Year by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.\n\nIn June 2013, Adele was appointed a MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music, and she received the award from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on 19 December 2013. In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by \"Woman's Hour\" on BBC Radio 4.

He continued to grow taller till he was 26.\n\nChanna came from an impoverished Sindhi family. He did not receive any noteworthy education. The male members of his family had traditionally served as minor retainers at the famous shrine of Sufi saint, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, in Shewan. Here is where Channa too spent most of his years, tasked to keep certain areas of the shrine clean. According to Channa’s paternal side of the family, Channa was making just Rs. 15 a week at the shrine! So when the circus offered him Rs. 160 a month, he decided to immediately accept the offer.\n\nThe circus turned Channa into a local star. He would travel with it across the length and breadth of Sindh. All he had to do was to make an entry just when two short men dressed as jokers were going through their routine. He would walk in and proceed to lift up the jokers (who would pretend to run away from the giant). Channa would grab them and then put them on his shoulders.\n\nIn 1981 a man who had watched Channa at the circus wrote a letter to the editors of the famous Guinness Book of World Records. With the letter he also sent some photos of Channa he had taken at the circus.\n\nMonths later some officials from Guinness landed in Sindh’s capital city, Karachi, and from there they reached Sehwan where they met and measured Channa. They measured him at being 7 ft 7 inches. On their return to the UK, the men entered Channa’s name in the Guinness book as the tallest living human on earth.\n\nIn 1998 his kidneys began to fail. The government decided to send him to the US and finance his treatment. But in a US hospital, he slipped into a coma and died, aged 45. He is buried in Sehwan.\n\n\"Channa belonged to an indigent Sindhi family. He could not get education.

He graduated with a structural engineering degree from Tehran University in 1951. He furthered his studies in seismic engineering under professor Seiji Naito in Weseda university Japan. He was a founding member of the Islamic Association of Engineers.\n\nMoinfar worked at the plan and budget organization during the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He had connections with the Freedom of Iran movement, which was led by Mehdi Bazargan. However, this link was not formal and he never attached himself to the movement. \n\nFollowing the 1979 revolution, Moinfar became one of the members of the Revolutionary Council. He also acted as the spokesman of the council. He was named minister of budget and planning to the interim government headed by Mehdi Bazargan.\n\nIn September 1979, Moinfar was appointed oil minister in a cabinet reshuffle, becoming the first oil minister of Iran in September 1979, when the office was established. He was also appointed chairman and managing director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), replacing Hasan Nazih.\n\nMoinfar continued to serve as oil minister after the resignation of the interim government of Bazargan in November 1979. He also won a parliamentary seat in the 1980 general elections. However, he was harshly criticized by the fundamentalists for removing ‘only committed Moslems’ rather than leftists from the ministry. Moinfar's tenure lasted until September 1980 when Mohammad Ali Rajai formed the cabinet. Ashgar Ibrahimi was nominated to succeed Moinfar as oil minister. However, Ibrahimi did not get necessary vote at the Majlis, and Mohammad Javad Baqer Tondguyan became the oil minister.\n\nMoinfar served as a parliament member until 1984.

The ancient sources place him interpreting omens from the conqueror's birth to his death. Although details are variously given, and some incidents are fictitious, Aristander was clearly an influential presence during Alexander's campaigns, and played an important role in uplifting the morale of the Macedonian army. There are indications he wrote divinatory works, either before, during or after the expedition, although it is also possible these works were spuriously attributed.\n\n\nWritings by Aristander are attested by: Pliny the Elder (\"Natural History\" 17); Artemidorus (\"Interpretation of Dreams\" 1.31, 4.23-24); Origen (\"Contra Celsum\" 6.8.10); see Lucian (citation missing). It is possible that Aristander's writings were, instead, a product of an Aristandrian \"school.\" Aristander's home town, Telmessus in Caria (modern Fethiye), was a proverbial font of seers. There may be some connection between the two items of \"Successor Propaganda\" (18–19, favoring Lysimachus and Ptolemy) and the rule of Ptolemy I Epigone as dynast in Telmessos.

He championed democracy, equality, education and organized Jewish labor.\n\nBaruch Ostrovsky was born in Ukraine, in the town of Rogachov, in 1890. In early childhood, receiving a traditional education, he already demonstrated a craving for higher education and Zionism. In 1912 he immigrated to Palestine alone, laboring with the pioneers of the Second Aliyah and joining the HaShomer organization. A year later, he departed for the U.S. with the intention of marrying his fiancée, who had by then arrived there from Ukraine. The political situation—the outbreak of World War I—obstructed his plans to return at once with his family.\n\nIn 1913 he took part in the founding of Ahuza Alef in New York, an organization dedicated to the purchase of lands and the establishment of a Hebrew settlement, to be inhabited by Jews tilling their own soil.\n\nWhile in the US, Ostrovsky earned his living teaching a wide variety of subjects, including Hebrew, history, Bible, as well as Yiddish. He became a renowned and respected educational figure, as director and inspector of schools as well as principal of the teacher's seminary of the Workmen's Circle Jewish educational system. Contemporaneously with his educational work, Ostrovsky was active in the Zionist Movement's labor organization, Poale Zion, with the leaders David Ben-Gurion, Ber Borochov and Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. He directed and published the Youth Organizations' journal.\n\nIn 1930 Ostrovsky finally succeeded in fulfilling his Zionist ambition by giving up his comfortable existence in the USA and settling in Raanana, a small town in the Sharon plain, with his wife and two children.\n\"\"As a Zionist, I abandoned my source of income, the respected position I acquired in America as the principal of a high school in NY, as the head of the Jewish Teachers' Union, as editor of a Jewish Journal and as author of Yiddish school books and immigrated to Eretz Yisrael. A Zionist is not only said ...\" (Excerpt from Ostrovsky's Diary)\"\nOstrovsky regarded Raanana as his life project and as mayor, he dedicated himself fully and wholeheartedly to Raanana's construction and development. His public service was a non-paid voluntary post as he refused payment in excess of the salary of an agricultural day laborer, which he was earning. The equivalent of his municipal salary formed a lending fund at the disposal of the needy. Many of the early settlers of Raanana benefited from his support. He displayed sincere concern for the welfare and rights of the laborers. He joined forces to form a variety of beneficial enterprises: a unified labor office, a unified front protecting organized Jewish labor, a joint health fund (\"kupat holim\") for all inhabitants of the town, and the establishment of a lending and savings bank; also, the organization of a permanent water supply system for the town.\n\nOstrovsky's activities as a supporter of organized Jewish labor are augmented by his campaign for laborers' voting rights—deprived from the new-comers by the older Jewish settlements taking advantage of the mandate's discriminatory set of laws. His modest mode of life, scorning all forms of luxury and excess, placed him on equal ground with the hard working and low earning inhabitants of his town. He nurtured good relations with the neighboring Arab villagers, particularly with those of Hirbet Azun. He set high standards for the city as a 'green' settlement, promoted equality and the welfare of citizens, and laid the foundation stones of many public and educational institutions.\n\nIn the mid 1930s, Ostrovsky had already laid the foundations and infrastructure for factories to be built in the settlement of Raanana. \nIn December 1949, he initiated the establishment of the industrial zone and directed his efforts to the building of the first industrial plants. This was part of an endeavor to create job opportunities for new immigrants and existing residents alike. \n\"We deal with industry exactly as we deal with agriculture\" (quoted from the minutes of a local council meeting on 2.1.1951).\n\nBaruch Ostrovsky was a lover of books and his 4000 volume library, encompassing a wide variety of subjects – on the history of the Zionist organization, on Eretz Yisrael, history, philosophy, education, literature and encyclopedias – were at the disposal of those eager to broaden their knowledge in the developing town.\n\nOstrovsky envisioned the plans for Raanana's first high school though he did not live to see it. Late in his life he wrote:\n\n\"We emigrated from America, not to be capitalists or land-owners, but rather to be Jews and live amongst Jews in an independent Jewish State, a democratic existence of equality, wherein everyone will be capable of earning his living – even if we are the sole followers of this socialistic system.\"\n"}

{"id": "5242674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5242674", "title": "Circe (comics)", "text": "Circe (comics)\n\nCirce is a fictional character appearing in DC Comics publications and related media. Based upon the Greek mythological figure of the same name who imprisoned Odysseus in Homer's \"Odyssey\", she is a wicked sorceress and the recurring foe of Wonder Woman.\n\nCirce first appeared as a ravishing blonde in 1949 in \"Wonder Woman\", vol. 1, issue #37, written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by Harry G. Peter. She would make a Silver Age return, going from blonde to raven-haired, to battle Rip Hunter in \"Showcase\" #21 in 1959 (written by Jack Miller and illustrated by Mike Sekowsky), followed by multiple appearances as a foil and sometimes-ally for Superman and Supergirl in \"Action Comics\" and \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\". In 1962 her \"creator\" Robert Kanigher pitted her against the Sea Devils in \"Sea Devils\" #3, illustrated by Russ Heath. She would get a Bronze Age makeover (this time with auburn hair) in 1983's \"Wonder Woman\" #302, by Dan Mishkin and Gene Colan, making multiple appearances over the next two years. Circe would be re-imagined in June 1988, by comics writer/artist George Pérez as part of his reboot of the Wonder Woman mythos. This version, with red-eyes and violet hair, would become one of Wonder Woman's principal Post-Crisis foes. Circe was re-introduced yet again in 2011 in \"Men of War\" (vol. 2) #2, as part of the DC Comics continuity-reboot known as The New 52. This version of the character, with blood-red hair and pale white skin, was written by Ivan Brandon and illustrated by Tom Derenick.\n\nHair color aside, all of these versions of Circe have retained a set of key features: immortality, stunning physical beauty, a powerful command over sorcery, a penchant for turning human beings into animals (like her mythological antecedent), and a delight in humiliation.\n\nIn the original DC Comics continuity (prior to the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"), Circe is a centuries-old enchantress who is kept young by an elixir called vitae. It is made from a special combination of plants and herbs. While living on the island Aeaea, Circe gains magical powers. Circe is very skilled at turning men into any animal resembling their personality, and, for her crimes against mortalkind, the Amazon Queen Hippolyta banished her to Sorca, \"an island planet in space, where she could do no harm\".\n\nUpon her return to Earth, Circe tries to destroy Wonder Woman, having heard from an oracle in ancient times that the daughter of Hippolyta will be her undoing. Unlike many of Wonder Woman's other Golden Age foes, Circe does not repent when her plot fails, and a legendary enmity is born. (\"Wonder Woman\" #37)\n\nIn \"Captain Marvel Adventures\" #66, set on Earth-S, it is revealed the evil immortal Oggar gave Circe immortality 3,000 years ago when she was a beautiful Graecian princess, hoping she would marry him. But because he did not give her eternal youth she keeps aging and becomes ugly, meaning she hates men who now have a hatred of her face, and learns magic to turn them into animals. Captain Marvel and Oggar battle on her island, and she turns Billy into a goat before turning him back. She finally helps Captain Marvel defeat Oggar by turning him into a boar. He jumps into a bluff and apparently dies, meaning she finally dies happily as his spell wears off.\n\nA woman claiming to be a descendant of the original Circe later appears and gives Superman an evolution serum, which temporarily transforms him into a partial lion after he does not agree to marry her. She leaves the planet by the time Superman returns to her island. Realizing the serum contains kryptonite, Superman theorizes the original Circe may have been from Krypton. (\"Action Comics\" #243)\n\nIn ancient times, Circe is responsible for changing Biron the centaur into a horse and later gives him super-powers as Comet the Super-Horse. She is depicted as more heroic during her appearances with Comet and Supergirl (\"Action Comics\" #293, 311, 323, 331). She also has encounters with Lois Lane and Lana Lang, and battles Rip Hunter, who meets her during his time travels. (\"Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane\" #13, 39, 40; \"Showcase\" #21) Catwoman once used Circe's wand to turn Superman into a cat, but he is turned back by an Egyptian mummified magic cat's paw used by Lana Lang.\n\nLater, Saturn Woman (a version of Saturn Girl from an alternate timeline) poses as Circe as part of Superman’s plan to defeat the Superman Revenge Squad. (\"Superman\" #165)\n\nDuring World War II, Circe transforms a British soldier who misses being in the cavalry into a centaur, then, upon his death, into a horse. At another point in World War II, she turned Nazis into swine and consumed them.\n\nThe character reappears, unnamed, in \"Wonder Woman\" #302 (April 1983) and is identified as Circe in issue #305 (July 1983) Circe reappeared with a mission to kill Wonder Woman in order to prevent an oracular prophecy of Circe's death at Wonder Woman's hands from coming true. After she failed to kill the Amazon with a series of attacks by man-animal hybrids, she took up with the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca, who set in motion a chain of events that led Wonder Woman to the jungles of Tropidor. Circe called on the god to send lightning down to kill Wonder Woman, who deflected the lightning bolts away from her and incinerated the herbs that made Circe immortal, thus fulfilling the prophecy. Circe then disappeared, swallowed up by Tezcatlipoca's magic obsidian mirror, which the god used to torture her with an image of herself as a crone.\n\nCirce begins to age normally and is last seen aiding a group of sorcerers who are trying to defeat the Anti-Monitor. (\"Wonder Woman\" vol. 1 #302, 305, 312-314; \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #9, 12)\n\nFollowing the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Superman\" are rebooted. All of Circe's prior continuity is erased and she is reintroduced with a revamped history.\n\nCirce is the daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Perseis. Circe is a powerful witch and former princess of Colchis. A beautiful, violet-haired, red-eyed sorceress, she is known for turning people into animals (which are called bestiamorphs), as well as for powers of mind control. Circe has been a devoted follower of the goddess Hecate for thousands of years. She has lived on the island of Aeaea where she became a powerful being in both magic and in influence over portions of man's world. During his adventure to her island, Circe fell in love with Odysseus and bore him three sons: Agrius, Latinus, and Telegonus.\n\nThough Circe's patron goddess Hecate was an offspring of the Titans, she was not considered one of the main Twelve Olympians. Zeus gave Hecate much respect, but she did not hold much favor with others on Olympus. As such, she married the god Hades, but their marriage did not last and Hecate was demoted as handmaiden to her former husband's new wife. Because of this, she left the realm of the gods and agreed to render her soul to her most devoted servant Circe. This caused Circe to attain her current goddess-level of power and immortality.\n\nWhen Hecate transferred her soul to Circe, she said the words: \"Upon the death of witch and the birth of witch, Hecate, by name and choice, shall repossess her soul\". In addition to being goddess of witchcraft, Hecate is also a goddess of the moon. When Circe learned that Wonder Woman shared her name with moon goddess Diana, she decided that Hecate's cryptic warning must refer to her. Fearing that Diana would steal Hecate's soul and power, Circe decided to destroy her.\n\nOnce Diana learned of Hecate's pronouncement, she too felt it pertained to her, but of course Diana has no desire to have the soul of Hecate possessing her body. This issue is central to the conflict between the two women.\n\nCirce's most ambitious gambit was inciting war between the various pantheons of gods throughout the DC Multiverse, becoming known as the War of the Gods. Circe's overall ploy was to gain the power of all the warring pantheons after they had defeated or destroyed one another. Another plot of the war was to disgrace Diana and the Amazons in the eyes of the world by portraying them as terrorists, allying herself with the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall to this effect. True to her nature, Circe eventually betrayed them as well. Over the course of the war, Circe succeeded in killing Hermes, who had since been in a severely weakened state from being away from Olympus for so long and temporarily devolving Diana herself out of existence by reverting her back into the clay from which she had been formed. Finally realizing the truth of Circe's deceptions, Earth's heroes launched an assault on New Olympus, which Circe had conquered and pitted the gods of the Olympian and Roman pantheons against them. Elsewhere, with the aid of the Spectre, Deadman, and the Phantom Stranger, Diana was restored to life and in a concerted effort with Donna Troy, used the amulet of Harmonia to open a portal into an alternate universe where the Titans of Myth resided. This caused the soul of Hecate herself to withdraw from Circe's body, which rapidly aged and crumbled to dust. Hecate then attempted to take possession of Diana, but was destroyed by the Lasso of Truth.\n\nCirce returned to life sometime later, though no explanation has ever been given for this.\n\nAfter the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall lost their Egyptian city at the hands of Diana's gods and turned to Circe for revenge, Circe remained true to her word and granted the Bana-Mighdallian Amazons immortality and teleported them to Themyscira in order for them to take over the island for themselves. Unfortunately for them though, after this was done, Circe eventually showed her hatred for all Amazons by betraying the alliance she had with the desert Amazons and cast the island and all its inhabitants into a dimension of demons. Thus, both tribes of Amazons spent several years battling demons for their own survival. When Diana discovered what the witch had done, she forced Circe to return the island back to its original location after losing a bet with the Amazon.\n\nThis is not the only time Circe has lost a bet to Wonder Woman and was forced to cancel a spell made against her. Later, Circe caused Queen Hippolyta to forget who she was and instead embrace the false life of a domestic housewife. Circe told Diana that if she could get Hippolyta to drink the antidote she would call off her attack. Diana was successful and Circe showed herself honorable once more by reversing all magical effects as promised.\n\nOne attempt Circe made in trying to destroy Diana involved a disguise as a mortal lawyer named Donna Milton. In this persona, she could get close enough to Diana in order to kill her when her defenses were low. Afraid that Diana would see through her disguise with her power of truth, Circe cast a spell on herself. The spell made Circe believe that she actually was Donna Milton and her true persona would only return when Donna could strike. As Donna Milton, she was hired by the mobster Ares Buchanan, who was really the god Ares in disguise himself. During their time together, they formed a romantic relationship and Donna became pregnant. As Donna, Circe actually became a good friend of Diana and ended up saving her life from Ares. He was sucked into a miniature black hole while Donna went into labor. No longer working for Ares, Donna gave birth to her daughter Lyta Milton and became Diana's lawyer at her and Micah Rains' new detective agency. When the Amazon Artemis single-handedly battled the White Magician, Diana realized that Donna was actually Circe and begged her to help transport her to Artemis' side. Not believing Diana and hurt that her friend would think her to be a villain, Donna yelled at Diana to leave and subconsciously teleported Diana to Artemis. Shocked, Circe's memories slowly began coming back to her. Still possessing some of Donna's false memories, she teleported herself to Diana in order to help her in her battle. Unfortunately, she was not on top of her game as she still had ties to her Donna Milton body, and the White Magician was not affected by her magical attacks. She used the remainder of her power to save Diana by teleporting herself, a demonically-altered Cheetah, and Cassandra Arnold, a television reporter and the White Magician's lover, away from the battle, leaving her last words to Diana be \"You're my only friend, Diana.\" This is the last we see of Diana's friend Donna Milton.\n\nCirce would make a Faustian deal with the demon-lord Neron to sell her soul to him in exchange for increased magical powers. She later formed part of the Injustice Gang gathered by Lex Luthor, alongside the Joker, Dr. Light, and the Ocean Master. During a fight with the JLA, she became preoccupied with Plastic Man. His shapeshifting powers allowed him to immediately change out of the animal forms she turned him into. She later proposed both a business and romantic relationship with Luthor, which he immediately shot down.\n\nShortly before Imperiex assaulted the Earth, Circe struck at Diana through her friends. She allied herself with Sebastian Ballesteros, who had usurped the power of the Cheetah from Barbara Ann Minerva and turned Diana's friend Vanessa Kapatelis into the new Silver Swan. Ballestros also became Circe's lover. She reveals herself after Vanessa attacks Wonder Girl, luring Diana into battle. After Hippolyta dies saving Diana from an Imperiex probe, Circe launches an attack on New York City. Her scheme involved the transformation of all male superheroes into her bestiamorphs save for J'onn Jonzz, Beast Boy, and Plastic Man, whom she took special means to keep imprisoned due to their shape-shifting abilities. She also imprisoned and transformed her former confederates in the Injustice Gang, taking particular delight in tormenting Luthor. Since the only persons who were not affected by the spell were women, many female superheroes entered the city in an attempt to save their friends and stop the witch's plan. However, Circe had planned for such a rescue and convinced the female members of various supervillain communities to join forces and stop the heroes by any means necessary. Leading the pack against Circe was Wonder Woman, who Circe also expected, sending a Doomsday-altered Superman. She hoped to demoralize the world by making Superman and Wonder Woman kill one another, while she transmitted the fight in a global simulcast. Ultimately, Circe was unsuccessful in her plan as a majority of the female heroes were able to change back their male super-powered friends with the use of the herb moly, which has a tendency to disrupt Circe's magic. After a protracted fight, Diana broke Circe's spell on Superman with her lasso. Luthor and the Joker managed to free themselves and threaten Circe's daughter. She quickly overpowered them and escaped with her allies. Circe continued to harass Diana and Donna Troy, appearing in their dreams as a dying Hippolyta. Diana tracked Circe to the Parthenon, where they fought in single combat, again on a global simulcast. Circe had cast spells on herself to make her Diana's physical equal, but ultimately she was defeated. During the fight, she claimed her hatred of Diana was fueled by the hypocrisy and naivete she perceived in Diana's beliefs in a better world. She attempted to goad Diana into killing her, but Diana spared her.\n\nShe was also rescued from possible death by the two living Gorgon sisters Stheno and Euryale once the island of Themyscira toppled into the sea. As repayment, Circe revived their long-dead sister Medusa, who eventually became a fellow enemy of Wonder Woman.\n\nShortly after Medusa's defeat, Circe's daughter Lyta was kidnapped by her father Ares while under the protection of the Amazons on Themyscira. Confronting Ares, she soon discovered that the time of the gods was at a crossroads and joined Ares as his consort as the new ruler of Tartarus. Thus, Lyta continued to be cared for by both of her parents, reunited.\n\nIn the \"One Year Later\" storyline, Circe was revealed to be the source behind the new upgrades to Wonder Woman's rogues gallery, increasing their power \"beyond their wildest imaginings\". Circe stole Diana's powers, explaining her rationale for doing so was to avenge wronged women whom she believed Diana had no real interest in helping. After completing the spell, Circe is shown in an altered Wonder Woman-style costume and proceeds to slaughter slave traders in various cities. This greatly resembles a previous occurrence written by Phil Jimenez in which Circe magically caused herself to possess the strength of \"Earth's strongest woman\". During her battle with Diana, she proceeded to alter her costume several times. Diana eventually regains her powers from Circe but it was revealed that Circe and Hercules were the only Greek gods to disobey Athena's orders to leave the earthly realm. It is assumed that she left her daughter Lyta in the care of her father Ares.\n\nShe was also responsible for giving Everyman his shapeshifting powers back in order to replace Sarge Steel at the Department of Metahuman Affairs and instigate the events leading up to the Amazons Attack! storyline. It was during this storyline that Circe revived the long-dead mother of Wonder Woman and convinced her to reclaim her throne in order to attack the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C. Once Hippolyta discovered that part of Circe's plans involved the destruction of Themyscira, she threw a spear into Circe's chest, critically wounding her. She was presumed to have been killed, but she appeared at the end of \"Amazons Attack! #4\" alive and well. She explains that she brought about the events of Amazons Attack to punish the Olympian Gods for allowing Ares to steal her daughter Lyta from her. Circe was then banished to Hades by a disguised Granny Goodness who stole the persona of the goddess Athena.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Circe is re-established as a pale, red-haired sorceress with a vendetta against Queen Hippolyta and the Amazons. She allied herself with Magog and used her magical abilities to manipulate Superman into battling Wonder Woman. However, Wonder Woman broke Superman out of the mind control, and the pair defeated Circe and Magog.\n\nAfter the events of DC Rebirth, Circe's history was altered. Seven years after Diana left Themyscira to become Wonder Woman, the C.E.O. of Empire Industries, Veronica Cale, performed a ritual to summon Circe in order to exact her revenge on the gods Deimos and Phobos, who had taken the soul of Cale's daughter Isadore. After bargaining, Circe agreed to help Cale. She gave her detailed instructions and then returned to her lair to begin her spell of binding.\n\nCirce later confronted Wonder Woman in Al-Doha, Qurac. She spoke in Diana's native Amazonian language, which surprised the warrior. After killing several soldiers, Circe tricked Wonder Woman into wrapping her lasso around the witch, enabling her to complete the ritual to bind Deimos and Phobos into the forms of dogs. Circe then teleported back to Veronica Cale and Doctor Cyber, Cale's ally. Circe then revealed to Cale that her daughter's soul was not in the soulstone as she previously believed. Circe communicated to Deimos and Phobos in their animal forms, discovering that Isadore's soul had been taken by Ares, who was imprisoned on Themyscira. Circe refused to help Cale any further, as she realized to free Cale's daughter would involve freeing Ares from his prison.\n\nYears later, Circe allied herself with Lex Luthor and Ra's al Ghul after discovering the Pandora Pits. The trio fought a creature that emerged from the pits, representing their fear and hatred towards Wonder Woman, Superman, and Batman. They managed to defeat the creature by combining their powers.\n\nThough Luthor leaves immediately afterward, Ra’s remains behind and Circe explains that the pits contain an army of demons which require a sacrifice in order to be released. The pair is interrupted by Etrigan the Demon who has detected the pits. During the confrontation, Ra’s cuts Etrigan and his blood touches the pits. They then absorb him and separate him from his human host, Jason Blood. Etrigan is also turned into a giant demon and attacks a nearby town, accompanied by an army of demons. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman arrive and enact a spell to trap Etrigan inside Jason Blood again, though the spell requires their sacrifice. Circe intervenes and saves them, knowing she needs them alive for her plan. Ra’s and she then teleport away to Antarctica where the Pandora Pits have reappeared. They then greet Red Hood, Artemis, and Bizarro, having lured them to the location.\n\nCirce and Ra’s then have the pits possess Red Hood and the Outlaws and send them to attack Gotham, where they battle Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. John Constantine, Zatanna, and Deadman are summoned by Batman to assist them. However, Zatanna and Deadman end up being swallowed by a possessed Red Hood and teleported to the Pandora Pits in Antarctica. John Constantine follows them and tricks Circe into using Deadman to possess Superman, all in a bid to buy time for his allies.\n\nIt is revealed that long ago, Circe sold her soul to a dimension of Hell and has tried over the centuries to regain it. The Pandora Pits are actually a portal that leads to the realm where Circe’s soul is located. The narration, told by Circe herself, also confesses that she believes death has finally come for her and she is in fact scared of dying. She then betrays Ra’s and has Zatanna possessed, who brings her Superman and Wonder Woman.\n\nShe prepares to sacrifice them when Batman intervenes with the Outlaws whom he has freed from Circe’s control. Circe fights back by having her Animen form a colossus around her, only to be subdued by the heroes. Ra’s then stabs Circe in revenge for her betrayal before tossing her into the pits. In what she thinks are her final moments, Circe again expresses her fear of dying before being rescued by Wonder Woman.\n\nWhen Diana is struck by the witchmark of the goddess Hecate, she travels to Aeaea along with the Justice League Dark, hoping Circe can help due to her being a worshipper of Hecate. At first Circe transforms the male members of the League into Ani-men, but upon seeing Diana’s witchmark, she quickly reverses her spell and admits that she plays the role of a supervillain purely to occupy herself. Circe goes as far as to console Diana, knowing full well what the witchmark signifies. Refusing to become Hecate’s puppet, Wonder Woman formulates a plan and Circe casts a spell allowing Diana to control Hecate’s power without becoming its slave.\n\nCirce is a goddess-level witch of vastly powerful magical/mystical energy and strength; as such, she is immortal. She is able to transform reality and solid matter through magic and spells. Among other things, she can alter minds, fire destructive magical energy blasts, create illusions, revive the dead (as she did with Medusa), teleport, and transform objects and beings. Her \"signature move\" is transforming men into various animals, like when she turned Odysseus' men into pigs. She can also use her transformative magics on herself, which further multiplies her natural abilities to superhuman levels, therefore giving her superhuman strength, endurance, agility, reflexes, superhuman speed, and resistance to most bodily injury. This makes her more of a match for Wonder Woman.\n\nCirce also possesses a magical mirror, often referred to as \"the Mirror of Circe\", that allows anyone holding it to alter their features into that of another. It is considered a forbidden object by the Olympian gods but has been stolen several times and used by Hercules. Circe also can magically summon, lure, and seduce men towards her with her enchantingly beautiful, seductive, melodic hypnotic calls, vocalized melodies, lullabies, or songs, similar to that of a siren. She can also project strong bursts of purple fire from her hands.\n\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" storyline, Circe was imprisoned by Hippolyta's sister Penthesileia in Antarctica for uncovering the truth of the Western European Amazon/Atlantean war. After getting the High Priestess (Tarot card), Traci Thirteen transports herself there and breaks Circe's chains.\n\nCirce appears in the comic book series based on the video game \"Scribblenauts Unmasked\". She briefly battles Superman and transforms him into a pig, but he manages to defeat her while Wonder Woman battles Black Adam.\n\nCirce appears in several stories of the anthology series \"Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman.\" In \"Defender of Truth\", Circe battles Wonder Woman and transforms the civilian police officers around them into centaurs. Wonder Woman manages to overcome Circe's magic and uses the magic lasso to restrain her. In \"Taketh Away\", Wonder Woman and a talk show host watch a video of Wonder Woman defeating Circe in Washington, D.C. In \"The Problem With Cats\", a young girl plays with her dolls, one of which she pretends is Circe.\n\nCirce was set to appear in the second volume to The Legend of Wonder Woman, a retelling of Wonder Woman's origins by Renae de Liz and Ray Dillon. However, DC cancelled the project under unknown circumstances. De Liz later posted preliminary artwork featuring Circe on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Daughterhood is the state of being someone's daughter. The male counterpart is a son. Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements. The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it. One of these being that the term daughter can also be used in reference to female descendancy or consanguinity. It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.\n\nIn patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons. A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters because the daughters are subjected to female infanticide. In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a bride price. The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman, is found in societies where women do not labour outside the home, and is referred to as dowry.\n\nIn the United States, the birth rate is 105 sons to 100 daughters which has been the natural birth rate since the 18th century. About 80 percent of prospective adoptive parents from the US will choose a girl over a boy. In clinics that enable sex preferences, daughters are usually preferred over sons.\n\nThe role of the daughter has been an important theme in literature, especially when exploring relationships between family members and gender roles. Through exploration of the relationship between children and their parents, readers can draw conclusions about the impact of parenting style on the growth and development of a child's character and personality.\n\nNotable daughters whose character and development has been impacted by their parents in literature have been:\n\n\n"}

From 1959 to 1963, he terrorised the city of Perth, Western Australia, by committing 22 violent crimes, eight of which resulted in deaths.\n\nEric Cooke was born on 25 February 1931 in Victoria Park, a suburb of Perth, and was the eldest of three children.\n\nCooke was born into an unhappy, violent family; his parents married solely because his mother, Christine, was pregnant with him, and his alcoholic father, Vivian, beat him frequently, especially when the boy tried to protect his mother from the elder Cooke's drunken rages. Christine Cooke would sleep in the staff room at her job in the Como Hotel to avoid beatings. Much like his mother, Cooke would hide underneath the house or roam neighbouring streets just to escape a night of his father's violence. Cooke was also placed in orphanages or foster homes on occasion.\n\nCooke was frequently hospitalised for head injuries and had suspected brain damage because of his accident-proneness. Later it was questioned whether this was due to repressed suicidal tendencies. He also suffered from recurrent headaches and was once admitted to an asylum. His reported blackouts later stopped after an operation in 1949.\n\nCooke was born with a hare lip and a cleft palate, for which he had one operation when he was three months old and another when he was 3½. Surgical operations to repair the deformities were not totally successful, and left him with a slight facial deformity, and he spoke in a mumble; these handicaps made him the target of bullying at school. In her book, \"Broken Lives\", journalist Estelle Blackburn's telling of the murders, he is described as \"a short, slight man with dark, wavy hair and a twisted mouth...\" Cooke's disfigurements made him ashamed, shy, and emotionally unstable at a young age due to the beatings and bullying that came with it.\n\nThough very good at subjects that required retentive memory and manual dexterity, Cooke was expelled from Subiaco State School for stealing money from a teacher's purse at the age of six. Once he was transferred to Newcastle Street Infants' School, Cooke was again the butt of many jokes with his mumble and scar. He continued to be made fun of at every school he attended, including Highgate Primary School, Forrest Street Primary School, and Newcastle Street Junior Technical School. He left school at 14 to work as a delivery boy for Central Provision Stores in order to support the family. He would give his weekly wages to his mother who could not fully support the family with the money she earned from cooking and cleaning. Many of Cooke's jobs put him in the hospital due to his accident-proneness. At a job in the factory of Harris, Scarfe and Sandover, Cooke landed in the hospital due to effects of being struck on the nose by a winch. At the age of 16, he worked as a hammer boy in the blacksmith section of the workshop at Midland Junction, where he always signed his lunch bag \"Al Capone,\" and ended up burning his face with steam and suffering second-degree burns. At the same job he jarred his right hand and also injured the thumb of his other hand.\n\nAs a teenager, starting at 17, Cooke spent his nights involved in petty crimes and vandalism; he would later serve 18 months in jail for burning down a church after he was rejected in a choir audition. During his later teenage years, Cooke would sneak into houses and steal whatever he found valuable. These crimes escalated to damaging clothing and furniture in acts of vengeance. He would cut out newspaper accounts of his crimes to impress his acquaintances in an attempt to gain friends.\n\nAt Cooke's grandmother's house on 12 March 1949, police finally caught up with the young vandal, finding evidence at his house. His fingerprints were then matched to those found in other open cases. At the age of 18, on 24 May 1949, Cooke was sentenced to three years in prison after being arrested for arson and vandalism by a Detective Burrows who considered the boy one of \"life's unfortunates.\" He was convicted on two charges of stealing, seven of breaking and entering and four of arson. He left many fingerprints and easy clues for detectives which would teach him to be more careful in his future crimes.\n\nAt the age of 21, Cooke joined the regular Australian Army, but was discharged three months later after it was discovered that before enlistment he had had a juvenile record for theft, breaking and entering, and arson. During his training, he was quickly promoted to lance corporal and was taught to handle firearms.\n\nOn 14 October 1953, Cooke, then aged 22, married Sarah (Sally) Lavin, a 19-year-old waitress, at the Methodist Church in Cannington. They ultimately had a large family of seven children, four boys and three girls.\n\nAfter marriage, Cooke was arrested several times as a \"peeping tom\" and for other minor offences. In 1955 he was arrested for stealing a car and sentenced to two years hard labour. After his release, he took to wearing women's gloves while committing crimes in order to avoid leaving fingerprints.\n\nCooke's victims included Jillian Macpherson Brewer, 22; Brian Weir, 29; John Sturkey, 19; George Walmsley, 54; Shirley Martha McLeod, 18; Constance Lucy Madrill, 24; Patricia Vinico Berkman, 33; and Rosemary Anderson, 17. As his crimes were opportunistic and used varying methods, and his victims shared no obvious common traits, predicting where he would strike and catching him was difficult.\n\nCooke's killing spree involved a series of seemingly unrelated hit-and-runs, stabbings, stranglings, and shootings. Victims were shot with different rifles, stabbed with knives and scissors, and hit with an axe. Several were killed after waking up as Cooke was robbing their homes, two were shot while sleeping without their homes being disturbed, and one was shot dead after answering a knock on the door. After stabbing one victim, Cooke got lemonade from the refrigerator and sat on the veranda drinking it. One victim was strangled to death with the cord from a bedside lamp, after which Cooke raped the corpse, dragged it to a neighbour's lawn, then sexually penetrated it with an empty whiskey bottle, which he left cradled in the victim's arms.\n\nTwo of Cooke's murders resulted in false convictions. One of them, for which a man named John Button was wrongly convicted, involved Rosemary Anderson. Another was the murder of Jillian Macpherson Brewer, a Melbourne heiress who was stabbed with a hatchet and scissors, which led to the false conviction of Darryl Beamish. Beamish was initially sentenced to death, but an investigation by \"Post Newspapers\" owner Bret Christian led to his conviction being overturned. The police case against Beamish is detailed in Christian's book \"\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, people in Australia frequently left cars unlocked and/or with the keys in the ignition, which enabled Cooke to steal a car almost every night. He sometimes returned stolen vehicles without the owners becoming aware of the theft, including several cars that were involved in hit-and-runs. Cooke's first hit-and-run was on Nel Schneider, 29, a mother of four who came to Australia from Amsterdam in September 1955. After being thrown from her bike, Schneider was left with a fractured skull and permanent brain damage.\n\nThe police investigation included fingerprinting more than 30,000 males over the age of 12, as well as locating and test-firing more than 60,000 .22 rifles. After a rifle was found hidden in a Geraldton Wax bush on Rookwood Street, Mount Pleasant, in August 1963, ballistic tests proved the gun to have been used in the murder of Shirley McLeod. Police returned to the location and tied a similar rifle, rendered inoperable, to the bush with fishing line and constructed a hide in which they waited in case someone returned for it. Cooke was apprehended when he returned to collect the weapon 17 days later.\n\nCooke confessed to many crimes, including eight murders and fourteen attempted murders. He was convicted on a charge of murdering John Lindsay Sturkey, one of Cooke's five Australia Day shooting victims. In his confessions, Cooke demonstrated an exceptionally good memory for the details of his crimes irrespective of how long ago he had committed the offences. For example, he confessed to more than 250 burglaries and was able to detail exactly what he took, including the number and denominations of the coins he had stolen from each location.\n\n\"Presumed Guilty\" includes Cooke's confession, made over two days in September 1963 at Fremantle Prison to his Legal Aid lawyer Desmond Heenan. \"I have a great respect for the law, although my actions don't show this,\" Cooke said.\n\nCooke pleaded not guilty on the grounds of insanity. At trial, Cooke's lawyers claimed that he suffered from schizophrenia, but this claim was dismissed after the director of the state mental health services testified that he was sane. The state would not allow independent psychiatric specialists to examine Cooke. Cooke was convicted of willful murder on 28 November 1963 after a three-day trial by jury in the Supreme Court of Western Australia before Justice Virtue.\n\nHe was sentenced to death by hanging and, despite having grounds to appeal, he ordered his lawyers not to apply, claiming that he deserved to pay for what he had done. After 13 months in New Division, Cooke was hanged at 8 a.m. on 26 October 1964 in Fremantle Prison. Ten minutes before the sentence was carried out, Cooke swore on the Bible that he had killed Jillian Brewer and Rosemary Anderson, claims which had been previously rejected because other people had already been convicted of those murders.\n\nCooke was the last person to be hanged in the state of Western Australia. He was buried in Fremantle Cemetery, above the remains of child killer Martha Rendell, who was hanged in Fremantle Prison in 1909.\n\nCooke's confessions appeared to exculpate two men who had already been tried separately, convicted and imprisoned for the killing of Jillian Macpherson Brewer (1959) and Rosemary Anderson (1963) respectively:\n\n\nDespite Cooke's 1963 confession, Beamish served 15 years, while Button was sentenced to ten years and served five as prisoner No. 29050.\n\nThe appeal court dismissed Button's initial appeal, even though Cooke had provided details that only the culprit could have known; in particular, the judges did not believe Cooke's claim that Anderson's body was thrown \"over the roof\" of an Holden EJ without damaging its sun visor, as Cooke had claimed. Over subsequent decades, Button and his supporters – including newspaper owner Bret Christian and journalist Estelle Blackburn – continued to press for a retrial, a campaign that included a well-publicized 1998 simulated reenactment of Anderson's death, conducted by crash test experts, with both a Holden matching one believed to have been used by Cooke on the night in question, and a 1963 Simca Aronde like the car owned by Button, which were both driven at a crash test dummy. The dummy was thrown over the roof of the Holden, as Cooke had claimed, and the damage sustained matched the records of a panelbeating business that had, in 1963, repaired the vehicle driven by Cooke. The experts found that the sun visor flexed when hit by a body and returned to its original shape, without even cracking the paint. An expert from the United States was brought to Australia and four 1960s cars were purchased by Bret Christian to prove Cooke's car, not Button's, drove into Rosemary Anderson.\n\nBeamish's initial appeal was also dismissed because the court did not believe Cooke's evidence. The prosecution claimed that his confessions were an attempt to prolong his own trial and the then-Chief Justice of Western Australia, Sir Albert Wolff, called Cooke a \"villainous unscrupulous liar\".\n\nIn 2002, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed Button's conviction. Button's success opened the way for an appeal by Darryl Beamish, who was acquitted in 2005. In both cases, the appeal judges found that the murders had probably been committed by Cooke.\n\nOn 2 June 2011, Beamish was granted a A$425,000 \"ex gratia\" payment by the Western Australian government.\n\nWalkley Award-winning journalist Estelle Blackburn spent six years writing the biographical story \"Broken Lives\", about Cooke's life and criminal career, focusing particularly on the devastation left on his victims and their families. New information on Cooke and fresh evidence published in the book led to the exonerations of Button and Beamish.\n\nIn Randolph Stow's final novel, \"The Suburbs of Hell\" (1984), he acknowledged that there was a delayed response to the horror of Cooke's murders, which he transposed for fictional purposes from his WA origins to a town resembling the English town he then inhabited, Harwich. Suzanne Falkiner's biography of Stow revealed that it piqued his sense of humour that Perth denizens at the time of the murders would knock on doors and say 'It's the Nedlands Monster'.\n\nA 2000 memoir by Robert Drewe, \"The Shark Net\" – later made into a three-part television series – provided one author's impressions of the effect the murders had on the Perth of that era. According to Drewe, more people bought dogs for security, and locked back doors and garages that had never been secured before.\n\nEric Edgar Cooke, as \"The Nedlands Monster\", features in Tim Winton's 1991 novel \"Cloudstreet\" and the subsequent 2011 television adaptation.\n\nCooke is referenced in Craig Silvey's 2009 novel \"Jasper Jones\".\n\nIn March 2009, the second season of \"Crime Investigation Australia\" featured an episode about Eric Edgar Cooke.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "950509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=950509", "title": "Farrier", "text": "Farrier\n\nA farrier is a specialist in equine hoof care, including the trimming and balancing of horses' hooves and the placing of shoes on their hooves, if necessary. A farrier combines some blacksmith's skills (fabricating, adapting, and adjusting metal shoes) with some veterinarian's skills (knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the lower limb) to care for horses' feet.\n\nHistorically, the jobs of farrier and blacksmith were practically synonymous, shown by the etymology of the word: \"farrier\" comes from Middle French: \"ferrier\" (blacksmith), from the Latin word \"ferrum\" (iron). A farrier's work in colonial America or pre-Industrial Revolution Europe would have included shoeing horses, as well as the fabrication and repair of tools, the forging of architectural pieces, and so on. Modern-day farriers usually specialize in horseshoeing, focusing their time and effort on the care of the horse's hoof. For this reason, farriers and blacksmiths are considered to be in separate, albeit related, trades.\n\nIn the British Army, the Household Cavalry have farriers who march in parade in ceremonial dress, carrying their historical axes with spikes. They are a familiar sight at the annual Trooping the Colour. There is also a farrier on call \"round the clock, twenty-four hours a day, at Hyde Park Barracks\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Worshipful Company of Farriers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. The Farriers, or horseshoe makers, organised in 1356. It received a Royal Charter of incorporation in 1571. Over the years, the Company has evolved from a trade association for horseshoe makers into an organisation for those devoted to equine welfare, including veterinary surgeons.\n\nA farrier's routine work is primarily hoof trimming and shoeing. In ordinary cases, it is important to trim each hoof so it retains its proper orientation to the ground. If the animal has a heavy work load, works on abrasive footing, needs additional traction, or has pathological changes in the hoof, then shoes may be required.\n\nAdditional tasks for the farrier include dealing with injured or diseased hooves and application of special shoes for racing, training or \"cosmetic\" purposes. Horses with certain diseases or injuries may need remedial procedures for their hooves, or need special shoes.\n\nIn countries such as the United Kingdom, it is illegal for people other than registered farriers to call themselves a farrier or to carry out any farriery work (in the UK this is under the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975). The primary aim of the Act is to \"prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons\".\n\nHowever, in other countries, such as the United States, farriery is not regulated, no legal certification exists, and qualifications can vary. In the US, three organizations - the American Farrier's Association (AFA); the Guild of Professional Farriers (GPF); and the Brotherhood of Working Farriers (BWFA) maintain voluntary certification programs for farriers. Of these, the AFA's program is the largest with approximately 2800 certified farriers. Additionally, the AFA program has a reciprocity agreement with the Farrier Registration Council and the Worshipful Company of Farriers in the UK.\n\nWithin the certification programs offered by the AFA and the GPF, all farrier examinations are conducted by peer panels. The farrier examinations for both organizations are designed so that qualified farriers may obtain a formal credential indicating they meet a meaningful standard of professional competence as determined by technical knowledge and practical skills examinations, length of field experience, and other factors. Farriers who have received a certificate of completion for attending a farrier school or course may represent themselves as having completed a particular course of study. Sometimes, usually for purposes of brevity, they use the term \"certified\" in advertising.\n\nWhere professional registration exists, on either a compulsory or voluntary basis, there is often a requirement for continuing professional development activity to maintain a particular license or certification. For instance, farriers voluntarily registered with the American Association of Professional Farriers (AAPF) require at least 16 hours of continuing education every year to maintain their accreditation.\n\n"}

His father died while Frank was still a child, and Anna Maria moved to Pittsburgh. When Frank was six years old his mother married William Lenz, another German immigrant.\n\nAt the age of 17, Lenz took up cycling, joining the Allegheny Cycle Club, and started exploring the roads of Pennsylvania. He soon went on longer trips, riding his bike as far as New York, St. Louis, New Orleans and Chicago. He was also an avid photographer, who would bring his camera on his biking trips.\n\nThe Englishman Thomas Stevens had completed the first circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 1887, and Lenz wanted to make an attempt of his own. He was hired by the magazine Outing (for which Stevens had worked) to publish reports and take photographs from his journey, and set out from the Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh on a Victory safety bicycle on May 15, 1892 with 800 onlookers wishing him well.\n\nGoing first to Washington D.C. and New York he then traveled west across the United States and parts of Canada, reaching San Francisco on October 20.\n\nFrom San Francisco he sailed to Japan, where he rode from Yokohama to Nagasaki before crossing to China. While he seems to have had a pleasant trip through Japan, which he praised in his reports, China proved a tougher stage of his journey. Japan had good roads for the time but the roads in China were in poor condition, especially in winter, and the locals were often hostile or fearful. He had expected to cross China in three months, but it took him six, and he was very happy when he reached Burma, part of the British Empire.\n\nThe jungles of Burma proved another difficult obstacle, with heavy rain and almost impassable roads, and he also contracted malaria there. Reaching Rangoon he found it impossible to ride his bike the next stage of his journey, and instead crossed by ship to Calcutta. In early October 1893 he left Calcutta, and spent the next month crossing to Lahore.\n\nFrom Lahore he decided to travel south to Karachi, and then traveled by steamer to Bushire in Persia, riding north to Teheran from there. He found Teheran a delightful place, and was loath to leave, but set out for Tabriz in April 1894, hoping to reach Istanbul before the worst of the summer heat.\n\nIn early May, 1894, almost two years after his departure from Pittsburgh, he set off from Tabriz on the next stage of his journey, with Erzurum as his next objective. He was never heard from again.\n\nWhen nothing was heard from Lenz throughout the summer, his family started to worry that something might have happened. The Ottoman Empire was at this time going through a period of turmoil, the ongoing Hamidian Massacres were killing tens of thousands of Armenians. It was difficult to ascertain what might have happened, but Alexander Terrell, the U.S. minister to Turkey, felt sure that Lenz had been killed by Kurdish bandits.\n\n\"Outing Magazine\" eventually sent another famous bicyclist, William Sachtleben, to Turkey to investigate the circumstances of Lenz' disappearance. Sachtleben had completed his own bike journey around the world in 1892, along with his friend Thomas Allen. He sailed to Europe in March 1895, and traveled to Erzurum, having to forge papers to gain entrance to Kurdistan.\n\nIn Erzurum, Sachtleben learned that Lenz had somehow insulted a notorious Kurdish chief when passing through a small village. The Kurds then apparently ambushed and killed him, burying his body on the bank of a river.\n\nThe Kurdish bandit was charged and convicted by the Turkish authorities, but had already fled. Some of the Armenian locals who had helped Sachtleben uncover Lenz' fate were also imprisoned, a couple of them dying in prison. Eventually, some eight years after his death, following pressure from the U.S., the Turkish government agreed to pay a compensation of $7,500 to Lenz' mother.\n\n"}
{"id": "580261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=580261", "title": "Frank Snepp", "text": "Frank Snepp\n\nFrank Warren Snepp (born May 3, 1943) is a journalist and former chief analyst of North Vietnamese strategy for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Saigon during the Vietnam War. For five out of his eight years as a CIA officer, he worked as interrogator, agent debriefer, and chief strategy analyst in the United States Embassy, Saigon; he was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit for his work. Snepp is currently a producer for KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, California. He was one of the first whistle blowers who revealed the inner workings, secrets and failures of the national security services in the 1970s. As a result of a loss in a 1980 court case brought by the CIA, all of Snepp's publications require prior approval by the CIA.\n\nBorn in Kinston, North Carolina, Snepp studied Elizabethan literature at Columbia University, graduating in 1965. After spending a year at CBS News, he returned to Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, graduating in 1968.\n\nSnepp was recruited to the CIA in 1968, by the Associate Dean of the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, Philip Mosely. Initially working on NATO and European security, he was sent to Saigon in 1969. Here Snepp worked as an analyst and counter-intelligence officer, coordinating agent networks and interrogation of captured enemy forces as well as preparing strategic estimates regarding the enemy. Snepp rejected the usual 2-year rotation, and stayed in Vietnam until the US was forced out in 1975. Snepp wrote in 2009 that he was \"still haunted\" by the \"psychological manipulation and torment of a prisoner\" he was involved with as a CIA interrogator.\n\nSnepp was on hand for the Fall of Saigon and was one of the last Americans to leave the US Embassy, Saigon before the city fell to the North Vietnamese on April 30, 1975. Snepp was evacuated with other American personnel in Operation Frequent Wind. On his return to the US Snepp was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit in December 1975, but he resigned from the Agency in January 1976, upset at its refusal to rescue Vietnamese left behind in the pull-out, and its refusal to acknowledge mistakes made.\n\nSnepp wrote a memoir of the event, \"Decent Interval\", published in 1977 without prior approval from the CIA Publications Review Board. The book was based on an after-action report that he had written and which he had sent through CIA channels. The report was not accepted.\n\nAfter the book was published, CIA Director Stansfield Turner pushed for Snepp to be sued and, despite the objections of some Department of Justice officials, Turner prevailed. Since publication of the book could not be stopped under the constitutional law forbidding prior restraint of the press, the CIA sued Snepp for breach of contract. Snepp was accused of violating the non-disclosure agreement he had signed when he joined the agency that forbade publication of any material about CIA operations without the prior consent of the agency. Ironically, President Jimmy Carter permitted the lawsuit against Snepp at the same time he had proposed the creation of a special unit to provide protection for civil service whistle blowers. In a press conference, Carter said that Snepp did not qualify as a whistleblower as he did not \"reveal anything that would lead to an improvement in our security apparatus or the protection of Americans' civil rights.\" Carter also claimed that Snepp had \"revealed our nation's utmost secrets\", even though he had not been charged with violating any security laws like the Espionage Act.\n\nSnepp accused the CIA of ruining his career and violating his First Amendment free speech rights. The CIA in return claimed that Snepp had violated his employment agreement by speaking out. They sued (\"United States v. Frank W. Snepp III\"). He enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union in his defense. In the end, the CIA won a court verdict against Snepp, with the US Supreme Court ruling that Snepp's book had caused \"irreparable harm\" to national security due to creating an appearance of a breakdown of discipline in the CIA. The royalties from \"Decent Interval\" (amounting to $300,000 by the time Snepp lost in front of the Supreme Court) were surrendered to the CIA, and Snepp forced to clear all future publications with the CIA.\n\nIn 2001 Snepp published a second book, \"Irreparable Harm\", about his court battle with the CIA.\n\nIn 1980, following the Supreme Court decision against him, Snepp became an investigative journalist, contributing to publications including the \"New York Times\", the \"Washington Post\", the \"Village Voice\" and others.

Then 24, Wills called the police after discovering that locks at the complex had been tampered with. Five men were arrested inside the Democratic headquarters, which they had planned to bug. The arrests triggered the Watergate scandal and eventually the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.\n\nHailed as a hero, Wills later struggled with his celebrity and had difficulty keeping a job. He played himself in the 1976 film \"All the President's Men\".\n\nWills, an African American, was born in Savannah, Georgia. His parents separated when he was a child and he was primarily raised by his mother, Margie.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school in 11th grade, Wills studied heavy machine operations in Battle Creek, Michigan and earned his equivalency degree from the Job Corps. He found an assembly-line job working for Ford in Detroit, Michigan. He later had to give up his assembly-line job due to health issues, namely asthma. Wills then traveled to Washington, D.C. and worked at a few hotels before landing a job as a security guard at the Watergate hotel.\n\nIn June 1972, Wills, at the age of 24, was working as a private security guard at the Watergate office building on the shores of the Potomac River. This was the location of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters. In the one year that Wills had worked there, there had been only one attempted burglary. In fact, it was considered so safe that security officers in the building only carried around a can of mace.\n\nOn the night of June 17, Wills noticed a piece of duct tape on one of the door locks when he was making his first round. The tape was placed over the latch bolt to prevent the door from latching shut. He removed the tape and continued on his patrol. Thirty minutes later, Wills returned to the door and noticed there was more tape on the same door. Without hesitation, Wills rushed up to the lobby telephone and asked for the Second Precinct police. The police turned off the elevators and locked the doors while accompanying Wills to search the offices one by one. Five men were found in the DNC offices. Wills recalled in 1997, \"When we turned the lights on, one person, then two persons, then three persons came out, and on down the line.\" Details that emerged during their questioning and trials triggered the Watergate scandal. The five men arrested were Bernard L. Barker, Virgilio Gonzalez, Eugenio Martinez, James W. McCord Jr., and Frank Sturgis.\n\nOne story reports that after the Watergate break-in, he received a raise of $2.50 above his previous $80 per week. Another story states he wanted, but did not receive, a promotion for discovering the burglary.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", Wills quit his job because he did not receive a raise. He then struggled staying employed because media opportunities and appearances kept him away from work, most of which consisted of minimum wage jobs. \n\nWills played himself in the 1976 film \"All the President's Men.\" The book and film were based on Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's 1974 book accounting their investigation into the Watergate scandal. Wills also appeared briefly on the talk show circuit.\n\nWills' log entry made on June 17, 1972 at 1:47 a.m. is memorialized in the .\n\nOver the next 20 years, Wills struggled to establish and maintain roots and stability while suffering bouts of unemployment. He shuttled between Washington and other southern cities, with some time spent in the Bahamas. He said in an interview that Howard University feared losing their federal funding if they hired him. A security job with Georgetown University did not last long. Also, he worked in a failed stint as a diet food spokesperson for the comedian Dick Gregory.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Wills finally settled in North Augusta, South Carolina, to care for his aging mother, who had suffered a stroke. Together, they survived on her $450 per month Social Security checks. In 1979, Wills was convicted of shoplifting and fined $20. Four years later, he was convicted of shoplifting a pair of sneakers from a store in Augusta, Georgia and sentenced to one year in prison. By the time of his mother's death in 1993, Wills was so destitute that he had to donate her body to medical research because he had no money with which to bury her.\n\nOnly when significant anniversaries of the Watergate break-in occurred did the waning spotlight reach out towards him again. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the burglary of the DNC headquarters, reporters asked if he were given the chance to do it all over again, would he? Wills replied with annoyance, \"That's like asking me if I'd rather be white than black. It was just a part of destiny.\" That same year, Wills told a \"Boston Globe\" reporter, \"I put my life on the line. I went out of my way... If it wasn't for me, Woodward and Bernstein would not have known anything about Watergate. This wasn't finding a dollar under a couch somewhere.\" Wills was quoted saying, \"Everybody tells me I'm some kind of hero, but I certainly don't have any hard evidence. I did what I was hired to do but still I feel a lot of folk don't want to give me credit, that is, a chance to move upward in my job\".\n\nOtherwise, Wills tended his garden, made the local library his study, and led a quiet life with his cats. Frank Wills died at the Medical College of Georgia hospital in Augusta, Georgia at the age of 52 from a brain tumor.\n\nFrank Wills was honored by the NAACP. The civil rights organization presented him with a truck.\n\nMusician Harry Nilsson dedicated his 1973 album, \"A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night\", to Wills, for his role in bringing down Nixon.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee gave Wills an award, and the chairman said he had played \"a unique role in the history of the nation.\" \n\nAccording to Wills' obituary in \"The New York Times\", the \"most eloquent description of his role\" in American history came on July 29, 1974; Rep. James Mann (D-South Carolina), while casting his vote to impeach Nixon on the House Judiciary Committee, said, \"If there is no accountability, another president will feel free to do as he chooses. But the next time there may be no watchman in the night.\" \n"}

Schaller is recognized by many as the world's preeminent field biologist, studying wildlife throughout Africa, Asia and South America. Born in Berlin, Schaller grew up in Germany, but moved to Missouri as a teen. He is vice president of Panthera Corporation and serves as chairman of their Cat Advisory Council. Schaller is also a senior conservationist at the Bronx Zoo-based Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nSchaller received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Alaska in 1955, and went on to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to obtain his PhD in 1962. From 1962 to 1963, he was a fellow at the Behavioral Sciences department of Stanford University. From 1963 to 1966, Schaller served as research associate for the Johns Hopkins University Pathobiology department, and from 1966 to 1972, served as the Rockefeller University's and New York Zoological Society's research associate in research and animal behavior as part of the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior. From 1972 to 1979, he served as Coordinator of the Center for Field Biology and Conservation, which replaced the IRAB. He then served as Director of the New York Zoological Society's International Conservation Program from 1979 to 1988.\n\nIn 1959, when Schaller was only 26, he traveled to Central Africa to study and live with the mountain gorillas (\"Gorilla beringei beringei\") of the Virunga Volcanoes. Little was known about the life of gorillas in the wild until the publication of \"The Mountain Gorilla: Ecology and Behavior\" in 1963, that first conveyed to the general public just how profoundly intelligent and gentle gorillas really are, contrary to then-common beliefs. Schaller also, in 1964, recounted this epic two-year study in \"The Year of the Gorilla\", which also provides a broader historical perspective on the efforts to save one of humankind's nearest relatives from the brink of extinction.\n\nThe American zoologist Dian Fossey, with assistance from the National Geographic society and Louis Leakey, followed Schaller's ground-breaking field research on mountain gorillas in the Virungas. Schaller and Fossey were instrumental in dispelling the public perception of gorillas as brutes, by demonstrably establishing the deep compassion and social intelligence evident among gorillas, and how very closely their behavior parallels that of humans.\n\nIn 1966, Schaller and his wife traveled to Tanzania to live in the Serengeti, and Schaller conducted one of the first studies of social behavior and movement of Africa's big cats.\n\nIn his 1972 work \"The Tree Where Man Was Born\", author Peter Matthiessen described Schaller as \"single-minded, not easy to know\". Matthiessen went on to say Schaller was \"a stern pragmatist\" who \"takes a hard-eyed look at almost everything\", \"lean and intent\", and in 1978's \"The Snow Leopard\" Matthiessen wrote that by that time, some considered Schaller the world's finest field biologist.\n\nIn the fall of 1973, Schaller went to the remote Himalayan region, inside Dolpo, an area of Nepal occupied by people of the Tibetan culture and ethnicity. Schaller was there to study the Himalayan Bharal, (blue sheep), and possibly glimpse the elusive snow leopard, an animal rarely spotted in the wild. Schaller is one of only two Westerners known to have seen a snow leopard in Nepal between 1950 and 1978. Accompanying him on the trip was Matthiessen, and as a result of the trip, Matthiessen wrote \"The Snow Leopard\", (1978) detailing the accounts of their travels and research, which won two U.S. National Book Awards. Schaller is referred to throughout the book as \"GS\".\n\nIn the late 1970s, Schaller spent time in Brazil studying the jaguar, capybara, \"alligator\"(caiman), and other animals of the region.\n\nIn 1988, Schaller and his wife traveled to China's Chang Tang (Qian Tang) region to study the giant panda, and became the first westerners permitted to enter the remote region. Schaller sought to refute the notion that the panda population was declining due to natural bamboo die-offs. Instead, Schaller found the panda's popularity was leading to its frequent capture, and was the biggest threat to the population. Schaller also found evidence that pandas were originally carnivores, but underwent an evolutionary change to accommodate a diet of bamboo, which is difficult to digest, reducing competition with other animals for food. Since Schaller's research, the panda population has increased in the wild by 45 percent. During his time in China, Schaller would hand out cards to wildlife hunters that read: \"All beings tremble at punishment, to all, life is dear. Comparing others to oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill.\" Schaller has spent more time in China than he has spent at his home in Connecticut.\n\nIn 1994, Schaller and Dr. Alan Rabinowitz were the first scientists to uncover the rare saola, a forest-dwelling bovine in Laos. Later that year, Schaller rediscovered the Vietnamese warty pig, once thought extinct. In 1996, he located a herd of Tibetan red deer, also thought extinct.\n\nIn 2003, Schaller returned to Chang Tang, and found the wildlife in the area had rebounded since his first trip to the region. Most significantly, the wild yak population, which was estimated at only 13 individuals, had grown to over 187. \"The Tibet Forestry Department has obviously made a dedicated and successful effort in protecting the wildlife.\" Schaller wrote in a letter to the World Wildlife Fund's Dawa Cering. While in Tibet, Schaller worked on researching the rare Tibetan antelope, or chiru, whose population declined due to trophy hunting for their exotic wool. Working with Tibetan authorities, and the Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation, Schaller helped protect the breeding and calving grounds of the chiru in the Kunlun mountains of Xinjiang Province.\n\nIn 2007, Schaller worked with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and China to develop a new \"Peace Park\", that would protect of habitat for the largest wild sheep species, the Marco Polo sheep. In danger due to their impressive spiral horns, which can measure up to in length, the sheep is sought out as a trophy by international hunters. Schaller's research in the Pamir Mountains will play an important role in the park's creation.\n\nSchaller's work in conservation has resulted in the protection of large stretches of area in the Amazon, Brazil, the Hindu Kush in Pakistan, and forests in Southeast Asia. Due in part to Schaller's work, over 20 parks or preserves worldwide have been established, including Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the Shey-Phoksundo National Park in Nepal, and the Changtang Nature Reserve, one of the world's most significant wildlife refuges. At over , the Chang Tang Nature Reserve is triple the size of America's largest wildlife refuge, and was called \"One of the most ambitious attempts to arrest the shrinkage of natural ecosystems,\" by \"The New York Times\".\n\nSchaller is one of a few prominent scientists who argue that Bigfoot reports are worthy of serious study. A 2003 \"Los Angeles Times\" story described Schaller as a \"Bigfoot skeptic\", but he also expressed disapproval for other scientists who do not examine evidence, yet \"write [Bigfoot] off as a hoax or myth. I don't think that's fair.\" In a 2003 \"Denver Post\" article Schaller said that he is troubled that no Bigfoot remains have ever been uncovered, and no feces samples have been found to allow DNA testing. Schaller notes: \"There have been so many sightings over the years, even if you throw out 95 percent of them, there ought to be some explanation for the rest. I think a hard-eyed look is absolutely essential\".\n\nSchaller has written more than fifteen books on African and Asian mammals, including \"Serengeti Lion: A Study of Predator–Prey Relations\", \"The Last Panda\", and \"Tibet's Hidden Wilderness\",\"Tibet the Wild\", based on his own studies, and supported by long-term observations of species in their natural habitats. Schaller has also written hundreds of magazine articles, and dozens of books and scientific articles about tigers, jaguars, cheetahs and leopards, as well as wild sheep and goats, rhinoceroses, and flamingos. Over more than five decades, Schaller's field research has helped shape wildlife protection efforts around the world.\n\nSchaller's conservation honors include National Geographic's Lifetime Achievement Award, \na Guggenheim Fellowship, and the World Wildlife Fund's Gold Medal for: \"Contributions to the understanding and conservation of endangered species\". \nSchaller has also been awarded the International Cosmos Prize,\nthe Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, \nand he was the first recipient of the Wildlife Conservation Society's Beebe Fellowship. \nSchaller's literary honors include the U.S. National Book Award in Science (for \"The Serengeti Lion\" in 1973). \nIn September 2008, he received the Indianapolis Prize for his work in animal conservation.\n\n\n\n"}

He studied philosophy and theology at the University of Freiburg, the University of Berlin and the University of Heidelberg, and finally earned his Doctor of Philosophy in 1928 from the University of Marburg with a thesis on Gnosticism entitled \"Der Begriff der Gnosis\" (\"The Concept of Gnosis\") and directed by Martin Heidegger. During his study years his academic advisors included Edmund Husserl and Rudolf Bultmann. In Marburg he met Hannah Arendt, who was also pursuing her PhD there, and the two of them were to remain friends for the rest of their lives.\n\nHeidegger joined the Nazi Party in 1933, which may have disturbed Jonas, as he was Jewish and an active Zionist. Certainly, in 1964 Jonas would repudiate his mentor Heidegger, for his affiliation with the Nazis.\nHe left Germany for England in 1933, and from England he moved to Palestine in 1934. There he met Lore Weiner, to whom he became betrothed. In 1940 he returned to Europe to join the British Army which had been arranging a special brigade for German Jews wanting to fight against Hitler (See \"The Jewish Brigade\"). He was sent to Italy, and in the last phase of the war moved into Germany. Thus, he kept his promise that he would return only as a soldier in the victorious army. In this time he wrote several letters to Lore about philosophy, in particular philosophy of biology, that would form the basis of his later publications on the subject. They finally married in 1943.\n\nImmediately after the war he returned to Mönchengladbach to search for his mother but found that she had been sent to the gas chambers in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Having heard this, he refused to live in Germany again. He returned to Palestine and took part in Israel's war of independence in 1948. Jonas taught briefly at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem before moving to North America. In 1950 he left for Canada, teaching at Carleton University. From there he moved in 1955 to New York City, where he was to live for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the Hastings Center and Professor of Philosophy at New School for Social Research from 1955 to 1976 (where he was Alvin Johnson Professor). From 1982 to 1983 Jonas held the Eric Voegelin Visiting Professorship at the University of Munich. He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York, on 5 February 1993, aged 89.\n\nJonas's writings were very influential in different spheres. For example, \"The Gnostic Religion\", based on his early research on the Gnosis and first published in 1958, was for many years the standard work in English on the subject of Gnosticism. \"The Imperative of Responsibility\" (German 1979, English 1984) centers on social and ethical problems created by technology. Jonas insists that human survival depends on our efforts to care for our planet and its future. He formulated a new and distinctive supreme principle of morality: \"Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life\".\n\nWhile \"The Imperative of Responsibility\" has been credited with catalyzing the environmental movement in Germany, his work \"The Phenomenon of Life\" (1966) forms the philosophical undergirding of one major school of bioethics in America. Murray Bookchin and Leon Kass both referred to Hans Jonas's work as major, or primary, inspiration. Heavily influenced by Martin Heidegger, \"The Phenomenon of Life\" attempts to synthesize the philosophy of matter with the philosophy of mind, producing a rich existential understanding of biology, which ultimately argues for a simultaneously material and moral human nature.\n\nHis writing on the history of Gnosticism revisits terrain covered by earlier standard works on the subject such as Ernesto Buonaiuti's \"Lo gnosticismo: storia di antiche lotte religiose\" (1907), interpreting the religion from an existentialist philosophical viewpoint. He was one of the first philosophers to concern himself with ethical questions in biological science. Jonas's career is generally divided into three periods defined by his three primary works, but in reverse order: studies of gnosticism, studies of philosophical biology, and ethical studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "311899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311899", "title": "Harley Quinn", "text": "Harley Quinn\n\nHarley Quinn (full name: Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel) is a fictional supervillain/antihero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, and first appeared in \"\" in September 1992. She later appeared in DC Comics's Batman comic books, with the character's first comic book appearance in \"The Batman Adventures\" #12 (September 1993).\n\nHarley Quinn is a frequent accomplice and lover of the Joker, whom she met while working as a psychiatrist at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, where the Joker was a patient. Her name is a play on the name \"Harlequin\", a character which originated in the commedia dell'arte. The character has teamed up with fellow villains Catwoman and Poison Ivy several times, the trio being known as the Gotham City Sirens. Poison Ivy is known to be a close friend and recurring ally of Harley, even being depicted as her girlfriend in recent comics. Since The New 52, she is now depicted as an antihero and has left her past as a supervillain behind. However, she's still depicted as a supervillain at times. Harley Quinn has also been depicted as a member of the Suicide Squad.\n\nThe character was originally voiced by Arleen Sorkin in the DC animated universe. Since then, she has also been voiced by Hynden Walch and Tara Strong in either DC Animated Showcases or in various video games. In the \"Birds of Prey\" television series, she was portrayed by actress Mia Sara. The character made her live-action feature film debut in the 2016 film \"Suicide Squad\", portrayed by Margot Robbie.\n\nHarley Quinn first appeared in the DC Animated Universe's \"\" episode \"Joker's Favor\", as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a walk-on role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a pop out cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre, although he ended up doing it anyway. Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker, who would become his love interest. Arleen Sorkin, a former star of the soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\", appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a jester costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn. Having been friends with Sorkin since college, he incorporated aspects of her personality into the character. Quinn was also inspired by a mutual female friend's \"stormy but nonviolent relationship\", according to Timm.\n\nThe 1994 graphic novel \"\" recounts the character's origin story. Written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book is told in the style and continuity of \"Batman: The Animated Series\". It describes Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, MD as an Arkham Asylum psychiatrist who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise and won the Eisner and Harvey Awards for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. \"The New Batman Adventures\" series adapted \"Mad Love\" as the episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second \"animated style\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \"Holiday Knights\".\n\nHarleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a badly injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he truly loves her.\n\nAfter \"Batman: The Animated Series\" and \"The New Batman Adventures\", Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the web cartoon \"Gotham Girls\". She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the DC animated universe, appearing alongside the Joker in the \"Justice League\" episode \"Wild Cards\" and alongside Poison Ivy in the \"Static Shock\" episode \"Hard as Nails\".\n\nHarley Quinn appears in \"World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie\" (a compilation movie consisting of three-part \"\" episode \"World's Finest\") as a rival and foil for Lex Luthor's assistant Mercy Graves; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's climax, Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront Superman and Batman, but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\n\nThe animated movie \"\" takes place in the future, long after the events in \"Batman: The Animated Series\". It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture Tim Drake until he has become \"Joker Jr.\", an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with Batgirl. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them—to which they answer: \"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\". Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future Batcave.\n\nDr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, PhD, is depicted as having been a psychiatrist (trained as a psychologist) at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum. \"Gotham City Sirens\" #7 (Feb. 2010) shows Harley visiting her family for the holiday season, in which they are portrayed as being very dysfunctional. It is stated that the reason Harley pursued psychology was to understand her own broken family.\n\nThe character's origin story relates that Harleen Quinzel was once a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum, and was assigned to treat the Joker. She eventually falls in love with the Joker and becomes his lover and accomplice. She follows suit in the Joker's clown-themed, criminal antics and adopts the name Harley Quinn, a play on \"Harlequin\" from the character in commedia dell'arte. Speaking with a pronounced Northeastern accent, Harley refers to the Joker as \"Mister J\" and \"Puddin\"', terms of endearment that have since been used in nearly every adaptation in which the two characters appear.\n\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the \"\" appearing in the style of a jester. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece, black, and red motley outfit with a cowl. Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. As Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD, she is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.\n\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black and red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black- and red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.\n\nFollowing 2016's DC Rebirth, Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of \"Suicide Squad\". Her hair color is now blonde with blue dip dye on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, ripped tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, fishnet stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like Margot Robbie's depiction of the character in the 2016 \"Suicide Squad\" film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She's also been known to wear both red and black colored nail polishes on both her finger and toenails in an alternating fashion.\n\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the DC Extended Universe, both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\n\nAfter the success of \"The Animated Series\", the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the \"Batman\" comic book canon. She first appeared in the original graphic novel, \"Batman: Harley Quinn\", as part of the \"No Man's Land\" story, although she had already appeared in the Elseworlds \"Batman: Thrillkiller\" and \"Batman: Thrillkiller '62\" in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.\n\nA \"Harley Quinn\" ongoing series was published monthly by DC Comics for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included Karl Kesel, Terry Dodson, A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of Metropolis with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the Jeph Loeb series \"\". She is next seen in a \"Villains United\" \"Infinite Crisis\" special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\n\nIn the \"One Year Later\" continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly upon in \"Detective Comics\" #823 (Nov. 2006).\n\nHarley next appeared in \"Batman\" #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \"punch line\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nHarley resurfaces in \"Detective Comics\" #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female Ventriloquist, who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and Commissioner Jim Gordon foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole.\n\n\"Birds of Prey\" #105 (June 2039) reveals Harley Quinn as the sixth member of the Secret Six. In issue #108, upon hearing that Oracle has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate Deadshot murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\", thus leaving the team.\n\nIn \"Countdown\" #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an Amazon-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian stola or chiton. She befriends the former Catwoman replacement Holly Robinson, and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to Themiscyra by \"Athena\" (really Granny Goodness) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter Mary Marvel. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to Apokolips. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by Thalia as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to Gotham City.\n\nHarley Quinn joins forces with Poison Ivy (Pamela Isley) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in the series \"Gotham City Sirens\". Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the Riddler's apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with Hush, the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\nIn \"Gotham City Sirens\" #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff\". The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.\n\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.\n\nHarley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle. Shortly afterwards, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman. During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.\n\nIn August 2016, the debut of the six-issue miniseries \"Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death\" reuniting Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman. Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD. with continued appearances throughout the series.\n\nFollowing DC's 2011 relaunch of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance was fully revamped. The New 52 shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black and her bleached skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.\n\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by Black Canary, she is forcibly inducted into the Suicide Squad by Amanda Waller. However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker. Her plan apparently pays off, and she manages to recover the face, though in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \"conversation\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation. After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \"Death of the Family\" story line, he forces her to disguise herself in his old Red Hood costume and trick Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where Joker is. But she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.\nOn July 16, 2013, DC announced that a new \"Harley Quinn\" ongoing comic book series would begin publication in November 2013, co-written by Amanda Conner and her husband Jimmy Palmiotti, cover illustrated by Conner, and story illustrated by Chad Hardin. The series has notably become distanced from the \"Batman Family\" of DC publications in both tone and premise, with Harley no longer having any significant connection to either Batman or the Joker following the \"Death of the Family\" storyline. In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at Coney Island, is a part-time member of a roller derby team and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\n\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an antihero, who after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with Poison Ivy. \"Harley Quinn\" series writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship. Between issues #11 and #13 Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac Power Girl and battled Clock King and Sportsmaster before Power Girl's memory was restored and she left Harley at the top of the Eiffel Tower as punishment for her deceit. Harley attempts to coerce a romantic connection with her tenant Mason, but was unable to make the date due to the multitude of responsibilities in her life, balancing her two jobs with her commitment to her roller derby team and her career as a crime-fighter. With support from Ivy, Harley makes amends with Mason and turns to the internet to recruit other strong, young women in a crime-fighting team she is forming. This team, comprising young women of various ethnic backgrounds and one gay man called Harvey Quinn, then fights Captain Horatio Strong, a sea captain who becomes superhumanly strong after eating an addictive alien sea-plant, in an homage to Popeye. Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.\n\nCatch Phrase: When startled or excited Harley tends to do a clear parody of Robin's old catchphrase by saying \"Holee\" and then some sort of alliteration.\n\n\"Harley Quinn\" has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the scratch and sniff-themed \"Annual\" issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the Arkham Asylum employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen. In the \"Valentines Day Special\", Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who unbeknownst to her is Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-super villain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses Batman and tells him to get \"lessons\" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which Batman privately grins.\n\nIn \"\", a series set five years in the future, Harley mails herself to the Bahamas in an attempt to save money on airfare. The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an un-contacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the Joker.\n\nAfter a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married. She is initially excited about the pending marriage until she discovers that the two will be sacrificed to the island's volcano as their wedding ceremony ends.\n\nA spin-off series entitled \"Harley Quinn and Power Girl\" was launched in June 2015. The series is set to run six issues and takes place while Harley has the amnesiac Power Girl convinced the two are a crime fighting duo. The story follows the two when they are sent to a part of deep space known as La Galaxia Del Sombrero during the unseen events mentioned in \"Harley Quinn\" #12 and then chronicles their journey to return to Earth.\n\nHarley has broken up with the Joker and has a romantic relationship with Poison Ivy.\n\nThe ongoing series has continued with no apparent connection to \"Suicide Squad\" other than her new hairstyle, dyed for her by one of the tenants in her Brooklyn apartment and a few guest shots from characters like Killer Croc and Deadshot. Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a \"vigilante for hire\" group she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis), and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return a man-bat was seen around town and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langston if he was behind it, but found him gibbering in his cell. He did however mention that there was \"another\". Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the man-bat and took it down only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife was the newest man-bat and she then jabbed Harley with the man-bat potion.\n\nAfter that mess a few of her old criminal buddies including Penguin, The Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure and soon Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand and they easily beat him up too. \nThis was followed up by a One-shot in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up and takes control again. Then leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge and heads out with Red Tool to go home. \nBack in the current time period she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton headed goof calling himself \"Lord Death Man\" who she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer whom she then catapulted away. When last seen Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuity everything was restored to normal with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a \"gray area\" being pulled into Harley's world.\n\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\", in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to National Suicide Prevention Week, but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bath tub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bath tub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.\n\nHarley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in \"Harley's Little Black Book\" including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill Hitler.\n\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called DC Rebirth in June 2016. In December 2017, DC opted to rebrand its titles under the \"DC Universe\" name, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth. Within the DC Universe, Harley Quinn is featured in a bimonthly third volume of her eponymous series, starting with \"Harley Quinn\" vol. 3, #1 (October 2016).\n\n Harley Quinn has a recurring role in the comic book title \"Suicide Squad\", which debuted its fifth volume with \"Suicide Squad\" vol. 5, #1 (October 2016). Following the events of DC Rebirth, Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in DC Universe. She wears tight, blue and red shorts, ripped white tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos and her hair color is blonde hair with blue dip dye on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hair style in 52.\n\nUnlike her counterpart in the New 52 series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hair style at the same time) she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and Poison Ivy's on again off again girlfriend.\n\nThe ongoing fifth volume of \"Suicide Squad\" shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity. Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Enchantress, Katana, and Killer Croc.\n\nWith the help of her friend Poison Ivy who is toxic by nature and did not want to poison Harley with her natural toxins, Harley Quinn is immune to various, though not all, toxins and heals quickly from minor wounds. It also enhanced her strength and natural agility. She also has developed an immunity to the Joker's venom and toxic gas, as mentioned in the Batman animated series and in the comic books, and other knock-out chemicals. If she's over extended though, like when she was turned into a man-bat, her immunity can be worn down and such things will work for a time. Harley is a trained gymnast with fighting skills honed by years of her criminal undertakings. She is also well educated as she has a PhD in criminal psychiatry and has her own nonlethal version of the Joker's gas. She has a slight immunity to mind control due to her insanity and not being sure what is going on in her head herself and has broken free of such before and mentally damaged beings who have tried to read her mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the release of \"Batman & Robin\", Mark Protosevich was commissioned by Warner Bros. to write a script for a fifth \"Batman\" film titled \"Batman Unchained\" to be directed by Joel Schumacher, with Harley Quinn and the Scarecrow as the film's villains. Protosevich wrote her as the Joker's daughter seeking revenge for his death.\n\nAustralian actress Margot Robbie portrays Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the DC Extended Universe, debuting in the 2016 film \"Suicide Squad\". Flashbacks reveal that Harleen Quinzel fell in love with the Joker while serving as his psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum. After she freed him, the Joker proceeded to electrocute her and convince her to fall into the chemical bath that created him, thus bleaching her skin and transforming her into his lover Harley Quinn. Harley assists the Joker in killing Batman's partner, Robin, before being imprisoned and blackmailed into joining Amanda Waller's government task force composed of captured supervillains. At the end of the film, the Joker breaks into Belle Reve Prison to free Harley, and they are reunited. The film received negative reviews, but critics praised Margot Robbie's performance, with many citing it as the main highlight. Paul Dini, the creator of Harley Quinn, said that Robbie \"nailed\" the character. Warner Bros. is currently working on a movie focused on the DC Comics female villains \"Gotham City Sirens\", and Robbie is set to reprise her role as well as produce this film as part of a first look deal. Robbie is also set for a Harley Quinn/Joker film, \"Suicide Squad 2\" and \"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)\".\n\nThe \"\" version of Harley makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 film \"Ready Player One\". This version of Quinn appears in The Distracted Globe nightclub sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarley Quinn appears in the \"\" franchise. Arleen Sorkin initially reprises her role in the first game whereas Tara Strong assumes the role for the remainder of the series.\n\n\n\nHarley Quinn has been interpreted as having dependent personality disorder as well as showing typically villainous antisocial behavior. Kate Roddy describes Harley Quinn as an \"ambitious career woman who gives up her autonomy to become an abused sidekick\", and discusses fan responses to the character.\n\nChris Sims describes the approach of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" as showing \"a version of the character who is having adventures \"right now\"\", and regards that choice as being a key part of Harley Quinn's production. Chris Sims describes her as the Joker's Robin.\n\nHarley Quinn has risen to become one of DC Comics most popular characters. The 2016 relaunch of her comic shipped more copies than any other DC Rebirth title and was one of the best-selling comics of the year. DC Comics co-publisher Jim Lee refers to Harley Quinn as the fourth pillar in their publishing line, behind Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Harley Quinn currently stars in four separate ongoing series — three eponymous titles and \"Suicide Squad\". Only Batman and Superman have comparable numbers of monthly appearances, making Harley DC Comics' most prominent and profitable female character. Kevin Kiniry, vice-president of DC Collectibles, says Harley Quinn is always a top-seller and that she \"can go toe-to-toe with Batman and the Joker as one of the most fan-requested and sought-after characters.\" In 2016, Harley Quinn's Halloween costume ranked as the most popular costume in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and it remains a popular subject for cosplay. To celebrate the character, DC Comics declared the month of February to be Harley Quinn Month and published twenty-two Harley Quinn variant covers across their line of comic books. IGN's 2009 list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Harley Quinn as #45. She was ranked 16th in \"Comics Buyer's Guide's\" 2011 \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11442998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11442998", "title": "Hausa people", "text": "Hausa people\n\nThe Hausa (autonyms for singular: Bahaushe (m), Bahaushiya (f); plural: Hausawa and general: Hausa; exonyms: Ausa; Francophonic spelling: Haoussa) is the largest ethnic group in Africa and the second largest after Arabic in the Afroasiatic family of languages. The Hausa are a diverse but culturally homogeneous people based primarily in the Sahelian and the sparse savanna areas of southern Niger and northern Nigeria respectively, numbering over 70 million people in total with significant naturalised populations in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Chad, Togo, Ghana, Sudan, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Senegal and the Gambia\n\nPredominantly Hausa-speaking communities are scattered throughout West Africa and on the traditional Hajj route north and east traversing the Sahara, with an especially large population in and around the town of Agadez. Other Hausa have also moved to large coastal cities in the region such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Accra, Abidjan, Banjul and Cotonou as well as to parts of North Africa such as Libya over the course of the last 5,000 years. Most Hausa, however, live in small villages or towns in Africa, where they grow crops, raise livestock including cattle and engage in trade. They speak the Hausa language, an Afro-Asiatic language of the Chadic group. The Hausa aristocracy had historically developed an equestrian based culture. Still a status symbol of the traditional nobility in Hausa society, the horse still features in the Eid day celebrations, known as \"Ranar Sallah\" (in English: the Day of the Prayer). Daura city is the cultural centre of the Hausa people. The town predates all the other major Hausa towns in tradition and culture.\n\nThe Hausa have in the last 500 years criss crossed the vast African landscape in all its four corners for varieties of reasons such as military service, long distance trade, performance of hajj, fleeing from oppressive kings as well as spreading Islam. The table below shows Hausa ethnic population by country of naturalisation:\n\nDaura, in northern Nigeria, is the oldest city of Hausaland. The Hausa of Gobir, also in northern Nigeria, speak the oldest surviving classical vernacular of the language. Historically Sokoto was the centre of Hausa Islamic scholarship.\n\nThe Hausa are culturally and historically closest to other Sahelian ethnic groups, primarily the Fula; the Zarma and Songhai (in Tillabery, Tahoua and Dosso in Niger); the Kanuri and Shuwa Arabs (in Chad, Sudan and northeastern Nigeria); the Tuareg (in Agadez, Maradi and Zinder); the Gur and Gonja (in northeastern Ghana, Burkina Faso, northern Togo and upper Benin); Gwari (in central Nigeria); and the Mandinka, Bambara, Dioula and Soninke (in Mali, Senegal, Gambia, Ivory Coast and Guinea). Migrants from these areas introduced various Africanised Islamic teachings to many Hausa by the 14th century, although Islam itself had a presence in Hausaland as early as the 11th century among the ruling class.\n\nAll of these various ethnic groups among and around the Hausa live in the vast and open lands of the Sahel, Saharan and Sudanian regions, and as a result of the geography and the cross crossing network of traditional African trade routes, have influenced each other's cultures to varying degrees. Today half of Nigeria’s Fula people cannot be distinguished from Hausa people in many northern states of Nigeria, due to inter-marriage and cultural assimilation. In Agadez and Saharan areas of central Niger, the Tuareg and Hausa groups are indistinguishable from each other in their traditional clothing; both wear the tagelmust and indigo Babban Riga/Gandora. But the two groups differ in language, lifestyle and preferred beasts of burden (the Tuareg use camels, while Hausa ride horses).\n\nOther Hausa have mixed with ethnic groups such as the Yoruba and Shuwa, incorporating the foods and style of dress into local Hausa custum, as well as heavily influencing the cultures of these groups. Islamic Shari’a law is loosely the law of the land in Hausa areas, well understood by any Islamic scholar or teacher, known in Hausa as a \"m'allam\", \"mallan\" or \"malam\" (see Maulana). This pluralist attitude toward ethnic-identity and cultural affiliation has enabled the Hausa to inhabit one of the largest geographic regions of non-Bantu ethnic groups in Africa.\n\nThe Nok culture appeared in Northern Nigeria around 1000 BC and vanished under unknown circumstances around 300 AD in the region of West Africa. It is believed to be the product of an ancestral nation that branched to create the Hausa, Gwari, Birom, Kanuri, Nupe and Jukun peoples.\nThe Kwatarkwashi Culture or Sokoto Culture located to the North west of Nok is thought to be the same as or an earlier ancestor of the Nok.\n\nNok's social system is thought to have been highly advanced. The Nok culture is considered to be the earliest sub-Saharan producer of life-sized Terracotta.\n\nThe refinement of this culture is attested to by the image of a Nok dignitary at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The dignitary is portrayed wearing a \"crooked baton\" (, ). The dignitary is also portrayed sitting with flared nostrils, and an open mouth suggesting performance. Other images show figures on horseback, indicating that the Nok culture possessed the horse.\n\nIron use, in smelting and forging for tools, appears in Nok culture in Africa at least by 550 BC and possibly earlier. Christopher Ehret has suggested that iron smelting was independently discovered in the region prior to 1000 BC.\n\nIn the 7th century, the Dala Hill in Kano was the site of a Hausa community that migrated from Gaya and engaged in iron-working. The Hausa began to adopt Islam as early as the 11th century CE although in small numbers. The vast majority still practised Hausa Animism at this time. The Hausa Bakwai kingdoms were established around the 7th to 11th centuries. Of these, the Kingdom of Daura was the first, according to the Bayajidda Legend.\n\nThe Hausa Kingdoms were independent political entities in what is now Northern Nigeria. The Hausa city states emerged as southern terminals of the Trans-Saharan caravan trade. Like other cities such as Gao and Timbuktu in the Mali Empire, these city states became centres of long distance trade. Hausa merchants in each of these cities collected trade items from domestic areas and from the rain forest region to the south through trade or raiding, processed (and taxed) them and then sent them north to cities along the Mediterranean. The trade influenced political development as ideas (and people) from the Middle East and North Africa made their way south to the cities. In fact the Hausa city state creation myth suggests that northern influence. According to the Bayajidda Legend, the city states began when Bayajidda, a prince of Baghdad, arrived in Daura (the oldest of the Hausa city states) and married the queen of the town. Their seven sons founded the other states of Katsina, Zazzau, Gobir, Kano, Rano, and Biram. These 7 cities are known as the Hausa Bakwai which means Hausa 7.\n\nBy the 12th century AD the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major trading powers, competing with Kanem-Bornu and the Mali Empire. The primary exports were leather, gold, cloth, salt, kola nuts, slaves, animal hides, and henna. Certainly trade influenced religion. By the 14th century, Islam was becoming widespread in Hausaland as Wangara scholars, scholars and traders from Mali and scholars and traders from the Maghreb brought the religion with them.\n\nThe architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age. Many of their early mosques and palaces are bright and colourful, including intricate engraving or elaborate symbols designed into the facade. This architectural style is known as \"Tubali\" which means \"architecture\" in the Hausa language.\n\nThe ancient Kano city walls were built in order to provide security to the growing population. The foundation for the construction of the wall was laid by Sarki Gijimasu from 1095 - 1134 and was completed in the middle of the 14th century. In the 16th century, the walls were further extended to their present position. The gates are as old as the walls and were used to control movement of people in and out of the city. \nBy the early 15th century the Hausa were using a modified Arabic script known as \"ajami\" to record their own language; the Hausa compiled several written histories, the most popular being the \"Kano Chronicle.\" Many medieval Hausa manuscripts similar to the Timbuktu Manuscripts written in the Ajami script, have been discovered recently some of them even describe constellations and calendars.\n\nThe Gobarau Minaret was built in the 15th century in Katsina. It is a 50-foot edifice located in the centre of the city of Katsina, the capital of Katsina State. The Gobarau minaret, a symbol of the state, is an early example of Islamic architecture in a city that prides itself as an important Islamic learning centre. The minaret is believed to be one of West Africa's first multi-storey buildings and was once the tallest building in Katsina. The mosque's origin is attributed to the efforts of the influential Islamic scholar Sheikh Muhammad al-Maghili and Sultan Muhammadu Korau of Katsina. Al-Maghili was from the town of Tlemcen in present-day Algeria and taught for a while in Katsina, which had become a centre of learning at this time, when he visited the town in the late 15th century during the reign of Muhammadu Korau. He and Korau discussed the idea of building a mosque to serve as a centre for spiritual and intellectual activities. The Gobarau mosque was designed and built to reflect the Timbuktu-style of architecture. It became an important centre for learning, attracting scholars and students from far and wide, and later served as a kind of university.\nMuhammad Rumfa was the Sultan of the Sultanate of Kano, located in modern-day Kano State, Northern Nigeria. He reigned from 1463 until 1499. Among Rumfa's accomplishments were extending the city walls, building a large palace, the Gidan Rumfa, promoting slaves to governmental positions and establishing the great Kurmi Market, which is still in use today. Kurmi Market is among the oldest and largest local markets in Africa. It used to serve as an international market where North African goods were exchanged for domestic goods through trans-Saharan trade. Muhammad Rumfa was also responsible for much of the Islamisation of Kano, as he urged prominent residents to convert.\nThe legendary Queen Amina (or Aminatu) is believed to have ruled Zazzau between the 15th century and the 16th century for a period of 34 years. Amina was 16 years old when her mother, Bakwa Turunku became queen and she was given the traditional title of \"Magajiya\", an honorific borne by the daughters of monarchs. She honed her military skills and became famous for her bravery and military exploits, as she is celebrated in song as \"Amina, daughter of Nikatau, a woman as capable as a man.\" \nAmina is credited as the architectural overseer who created the strong earthen walls that surround her city, which were the prototype for the fortifications used in all Hausa states. She subsequently built many of these fortifications, which became known as ganuwar Amina or Amina's walls, around various conquered cities.\nThe objectives of her conquests were twofold: extension of her nation beyond its primary borders and reducing the conquered cities to a vassal status. Sultan Muhammad Bello of Sokoto stated that, \"She made war upon these countries and overcame them entirely so that the people of Katsina paid tribute to her and the men of Kano and... also made war on cities of Bauchi till her kingdom reached to the sea in the south and the west.\" Likewise, she led her armies as far as Kwararafa and Nupe and, according to the Kano Chronicle, \"The Sarkin Nupe sent her (i.e. the princess) 40 eunuchs and 10,000 kola nuts.\"\nFrom 1804-1808, the Fulani, another Islamic African ethnic group that spanned West Africa and shared the area with the Hausa, invaded the Hausa states, starting with Gobir under the leadership of Sheikh Usman Dan Fodio. He declared Jihad on the traditional Habe dynasty kings for their alleged greed, paganism, injustices against the peasant class, use of heavy taxation and violation of the standards of Sharia law. The Fulani and Hausa cultural similarities as a Sahelian people however allowed for significant integration between the two groups. When the Fulani took over the Hausa city-state of Kano during the expansion of the Sokoto Caliphate, the new emirs ended up speaking the Hausa language instead of Fulfulde over the years. Since the early 20th century, these peoples are often classified as \"Hausa-Fulani\" within Nigeria rather than as individuated groups. In fact a large number of Fulani living in Hausa regions cannot speak Fulfulde at all and speak Hausa as their first language. Many Fulani in the region do not distinguish themselves from the Hausa, as they have long intermarried, they share the Islamic religion and many integrated into Hausa culture.\nBritish General Frederick Lugard used rivalries between many of the emirs in the south and the central Sokoto administration to prevent any defence as he worked toward the capital. As the British approached the city of Sokoto, the new Sultan Muhammadu Attahiru I organised a quick defence of the city and fought the advancing British-led forces. The British forces won, sending Attahiru I and thousands of followers on a Mahdist \"hijra\".\n\nOn 13 March 1903 at the grand market square of Sokoto, the last Vizier of the Caliphate officially conceded to British Rule. The British appointed Muhammadu Attahiru II as the new Caliph. Lugard abolished the Caliphate, but retained the title \"Sultan\" as a symbolic position in the newly organised Northern Nigeria Protectorate. In June 1903, the British defeated the remaining forces of Attahiru I and killed him; by 1906 resistance to British rule had ended. The area of the Sokoto Caliphate was divided among the control of the British, French, and Germans under the terms of their Berlin Conference.\n\nThe British established the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to govern the region, which included most of the Sokoto empire and its most important emirates. Under Lugard, the various emirs were provided significant local autonomy, thus retaining much of the political organisation of the Sokoto Caliphate. The Sokoto area was treated as just another emirate within the Nigerian Protectorate. Because it was never connected with the railway network, it became economically and politically marginal.\n\nBut, the Sultan of Sokoto continued to be regarded as an important Muslim spiritual and religious position; the lineage connection to dan Fodio has continued to be recognised. One of the most significant Sultans was Siddiq Abubakar III, who held the position for 50 years from 1938-1988. He was known as a stabilising force in Nigerian politics, particularly in 1966 after the assassination of Ahmadu Bello, the Premier of Northern Nigeria.\n\nFollowing the construction of the Nigerian railway system, which extended from Lagos in 1896 to Ibadan in 1900 and Kano in 1911, the Hausa of northern Nigeria became major producers of groundnuts. They surprised the British, who had expected the Hausa to turn to cotton production. However, the Hausa had sufficient agricultural expertise to realise cotton required more labour and the European prices offered for groundnuts were more attractive than those for cotton. \"Within two years the peasant farmers of Hausaland were producing so many tonnes of groundnuts that the railway was unable to cope with the traffic. As a result, the European merchants in Kano had to stockpile sacks of groundnuts in the streets.\" (Shillington 338).\n\nThe Boko script was imposed on the Hausa by the British and French colonial forces and made the official Hausa alphabet in 1930. Boko is a Latin alphabet used to write the Hausa language. The first boko was devised by Europeans in the early 19th century, and developed in the early 20th century by the British (mostly) and French colonial authorities. Since the 1950s boko has been the main alphabet for Hausa. Arabic script (\"ajami\") is now only used in Islamic schools and for Islamic literature. Today millions of Hausa-speaking people, who can read and write in Ajami only, are considered illiterates by the Nigerian government. Despite this, Hausa Ajami is present on Naira banknotes. In 2014, in a very controversial move, Ajami was removed from the new 100 Naira banknote.\n\nNevertheless, the Hausa remain preeminent in Niger and Northern Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a Y-DNA study by Hassan et al. (2008), about 47% of Hausa in Niger, Cameroon, Nigeria and Sudan carry the West Eurasian haplogroup R1b. The remainder belong to various African paternal lineages: 15.6% B, 12.5% A and 12.5% E1b1a. A small minority of around 4% are E1b1b clade bearers, a haplogroup which is most common in North Africa and the Horn of Africa.\n\nIn terms of overall ancestry, an autosomal DNA study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) found the Hausa to be most closely related to Nilotic populations from Nigeria, Cameroon, central Chad and South Sudan. This suggests that the Hausa and other modern Chadic-speaking populations originally spoke Nilo-Saharan languages, before adopting languages from the Afroasiatic family after migration into that area thousands of years ago.\n\n\"\"From K = 5-13, all Nilo-Saharan speaking populations from Kenya, Tanzania, southern Sudan, and Chad cluster with west-central Afroasiatic Chadic-speaking populations (Fig. S15). These results are consistent with linguistic and archeological data, suggesting a possible common ancestry of Nilo-Saharan speaking populations from an eastern Sudanese homeland within the past ~10,500 years, with subsequent bi-directional migration westward to Lake Chad and southward into modern day southern Sudan, and more recent migration eastward into Kenya and Tanzania ~3,000 ya (giving rise to Southern Nilotic speakers) and westward into Chad ~2,500 ya (giving rise to Central Sudanic speakers) (S62, S65, S67, S74). A proposed migration of proto-Chadic Afroasiatic speakers ~7,000 ya from the central Sahara into the Lake Chad Basin may have caused many western Nilo-Saharans to shift to Chadic languages (S99). Our data suggest that this shift was not accompanied by large amounts of Afroasiatic16 gene flow. Analyses of mtDNA provide evidence for divergence ~8,000 ya of a distinct mtDNA lineage present at high frequency in the Chadic populations and suggest an East African origin for most mtDNA lineages in these populations (S100)\".\"\n\nThe Hausa language has more first-language speakers than any other African language. It has an estimated 67 million first-language speakers, and close to 50 million second-language speakers.\n\nThe main Hausa-speaking area is northern Nigeria and Niger. Hausa is also widely spoken in northern Ghana, Cameroon, Chad, Sudanese Hausa in Sudan and the Ivory Coast among Fulani, Tuareg, Kanuri, Gur, Shuwa Arab, and other Afro-Asiatic speaking groups.\n\nThere are also large Hausa communities in every major African city in neighbourhoods called \"zango\"s or \"zongo\"s, meaning \"camel-caravan camp\" in Hausa (denoting the trading post origins of these communities). Most Hausa speakers, regardless of ethnic affiliation, are Muslims; Hausa often serves as a lingua franca among Muslims in non-Hausa areas.\n\nThere is a large and growing printed literature in Hausa, which includes novels, poetry, plays, instruction in Islamic practice, books on development issues, newspapers, news magazines, and technical academic works. Radio and television broadcasting in Hausa is ubiquitous in northern Nigeria and Niger, and radio stations in Cameroon have regular Hausa broadcasts, as do international broadcasters such as the BBC, VOA, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, Radio Beijing, RFI France, IRIB Iran, and others.\n\nHausa is used as the language of instruction at the elementary level in schools in northern Nigeria, and Hausa is available as course of study in northern Nigerian universities. In addition, several advanced degrees (Masters and PhD) are offered in Hausa in various universities in the UK, US, and Germany. Hausa is also being used in various social media networks around the world.\n\nHausa is considered one of the world's major languages, and it has widespread use in a number of countries of Africa. Hausa's rich poetry, prose, and musical literature, is increasingly available in print and in audio and video recordings. The study of Hausa provides an informative entry into the culture of Islamic Africa. Throughout Africa, there is a strong connection between Hausa and Islam.\n\nThe influence of the Hausa language on the languages of many non-Hausa Muslim peoples in African is readily apparent. Likewise, many Hausa cultural practices, including such overt features as dress and food, are shared by other Muslim communities. Because of the dominant position which the Hausa language and culture have long held, the study of Hausa provides crucial background for other areas such as African history, politics (particularly in Nigeria and Niger), gender studies, commerce, and the arts.\n\nSunni Islam of the Maliki madhhab is the predominant and historically established religion of the Hausa people. Sizable but visible minorities of Muslims belonging to the Tijani, Mouride and Qadiri sufi tariqas, and more recently, Shia and Salafi groups. Islam has been present in Hausaland as early as the 11th century. The Islamic population grew as the religion was brought by traders and Islamic preachers from North Africa, Borno, Mali and Guinea.\n\nMuslim scholars of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practised in royal courts. A desire for reform contributed to the formation of the Sokoto Caliphate. The formation of this state strengthened Islam in rural areas. The Hausa people have been an important factor for the spread of Islam in West Africa. Today, the current Sultan of Sokoto is regarded as the traditional religious leader (\"Sarkin Musulmi\") of Sunni Hausa-Fulani in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nMaguzawa, the African Traditional Religion, was practised extensively before Islam. In the more remote areas of Hausaland, the people continue to practise Maguzawa. Closer to urban areas, it is not as common, but with elements still held among the beliefs of urban dwellers. Practices include the sacrifice of animals for personal ends, but it is not legitimate to practise Maguzawa magic for harm. People of urbanised areas tend to retain a \"cult of spirit possession,\" known as Bori. It incorporates the old religion's elements of African Traditional Religion and magic. A small Christian minority also exists among the Hausa.\n\nThe traditional dress of the Hausa consists of loose flowing gowns and trousers. The gowns have wide openings on both sides for ventilation. The trousers are loose at the top and center, but rather tight around the legs. Leather sandals and turbans are also typical. The men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is a large flowing gown known as \"Babban riga\" and a robe called a Doguwar riga (see Senegalese kaftan). These large flowing gowns usually feature elaborate embroidery designs around the neck and chest area. (See accompanying image to the right).\n\nMen also wear colourful embroidered caps known as \"hula.\" Depending on their location and occupation, they may wear the turban around this to veil the face. The women can be identified by wrappers called \"zani,\" made with colourful cloth known as \"atampa or Ankara\", (a descendant of early designs from the famous tie-dye techniques the Hausa have for centuries been known for Tie-dye) accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie and shawl.\n\nThe Hausa were famous throughout the Middle Ages; they were often characterized by their Indigo blue dressing and emblems which earned them the nickname \"bluemen\". They traditionally rode on fine Saharan camels and horses.\n\nHausa architecture (known as \"Tubali\" in the Hausa language) is a distinct sub-style among the various Sudano-Sahelian architectural styles found throughout the Sahel-geographic band stretching from Senegal and Mauritania in the West to Sudan in the east.\n\nHausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of parapets related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colours to convey information about the occupant.\n\nThe most common food that the Hausa people prepare consists of grains, such as sorghum, millet, rice, or maize, which are ground into flour for a variety of different kinds of dishes. This food is popularly known as \"tuwo\" in the Hausa language.\n\nUsually, breakfast consists of cakes made from ground beans and fried, known as \"kosai\"; or made from wheat flour soaked for a day, fried and served with sugar, known as \"funkaso\". Both of these cakes can be served with porridge and sugar known as \"kunu\" or \"koko\". Lunch or dinner usually feature a heavy porridge with soup and stew known as \"tuwo da miya\". The soup and stew are usually prepared with ground or chopped tomatoes, onions, and local spices.\n\nSpices and other vegetables, such as spinach, pumpkin, or okra, are added to the soup during preparation. The stew is prepared with meat, which can include goat or cow meat, but not pork, due to Islamic food restrictions. Beans, peanuts, and milk are also served as a complementary protein diet for the Hausa people.\n\nThe most famous of all Hausa food is most likely Suya, a spicy shish kebab like skewered meat which is a popular food item in various parts of Nigeria and is enjoyed as a delicacy in much of West Africa and balangu of gasshi.\n\nA dried version of Suya is called Kilishi.\n\nA modern literary movement led by female Hausa writers has grown since the late 1980s when writer Balaraba Ramat Yakubu came to popularity. In time, the writers spurred a unique genre known as Kano market literature — so named because the books are often self-published and sold in the markets of Nigeria. Islamic extremism and misogyny have hindered women's ability to work and write openly. However, the subversive nature of these novels, which are often romantic and family dramas that are otherwise hard to find in the Hausa language, have made them popular, especially among female readers. The genre is also referred to as \"littattafan soyayya\", or \"love literature.\"\n\nA proposed Hausa ethnic flag is a banner with five horizontal stripes—from top to bottom they are red, yellow, indigo blue, green, and khaki beige. The older and traditionally established motif of Hausa identity, the eternal knot in a star shape, is used in historic architecture, design and embroidery.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13706", "title": "Hero", "text": "Hero\n\nA hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are Medieval and modern heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.\n\nThe concept of the hero can be found in classical literature. It is the main or revered character in heroic epic poetry celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code. The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. Merriam Webster dictionary defines a hero as \"a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities.\" Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as Gilgamesh, Achilles and Iphigenia, to historical figures, such as Joan of Arc or Sophie Scholl, modern heroes like Alvin York, Audie Murphy and Chuck Yeager, and fictional superheroes, including Superman and Batman.\n\nThe word \"hero\" comes from the Greek ἥρως (\"hērōs\"), \"hero\" (literally \"protector\" or \"defender\"), particularly one such as Heracles with divine ancestry or later given divine honors. Before the decipherment of Linear B the original form of the word was assumed to be *, \"hērōw-\", but the Mycenaean compound \"ti-ri-se-ro-e\" demonstrates the absence of -w-.\n\nAccording to the \"American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", the Proto-Indo-European root is \"*ser\" meaning \"to protect\". According to Eric Partridge in \"Origins,\" the Greek word \"Hērōs\" \"is akin to\" the Latin \"seruāre,\" meaning \"to safeguard\". Partridge concludes, \"The basic sense of both Hera and hero would therefore be 'protector'.\" R. S. P. Beekes rejects an Indo-European derivation and asserts that the word has a Pre-Greek origin.\n\nA classical hero is considered to be a \"warrior who lives and dies in the pursuit of honor\" and asserts their greatness by \"the brilliancy and efficiency with which they kill\". Each classical hero's life focuses on fighting, which occurs in war or during an epic quest. Classical heroes are commonly semi-divine and extraordinarily gifted, like Achilles, evolving into heroic characters through their perilous circumstances. While these heroes are incredibly resourceful and skilled, they are often foolhardy, court disaster, risk their followers' lives for trivial matters, and behave arrogantly in a childlike manner. During classical times, people regarded heroes with the highest esteem and utmost importance, explaining their prominence within epic literature. The appearance of these mortal figures marks a revolution of audiences and writers turning away from immortal gods to mortal mankind, whose heroic moments of glory survive in the memory of their descendants, extending their legacy.\n\nHector was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War, which is known primarily through Homer's \"The Iliad\". Hector acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, \"killing 31,000 Greek fighters,\" offers Hyginus. Hector was known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. However, his familial values conflict greatly with his heroic aspirations in \"The Iliad,\" as he cannot be both the protector of Troy and a father to his child. Hector is ultimately betrayed by the gods when Athena appears disguised as his ally Deiphobus and convinces him to take on Achilles, leading to his death at the hands of a superior warrior.Achilles was a Greek Hero who was considered the most formidable military fighter in the entire Trojan War and the central character of \"The Iliad.\" He was the child of Thetis and Peleus, making him a demi-god. He wielded superhuman strength on the battlefield and was blessed with a close relationship to the Gods. Achilles famously refuses to fight after his dishonoring at the hands of Agamemnon, and only returns to the war due to unadulterated rage after Hector kills his close friend Patroclus. Achilles was known for uncontrollable rage that defined many of his bloodthirsty actions, such as defiling Hector's corpse by dragging it around the city of Troy. Achilles plays a tragic role in \"The Iliad\" brought about by constant de-humanization throughout the epic, having his \"menis\" (wrath) overpower his \"philos\" (love).\n\nHeroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus Heracles's name means \"the glory of Hera\", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king Erechtheus, whom Poseidon killed for choosing Athena over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the Acropolis, they invoked him as \"Poseidon Erechtheus\".\n\nFate, or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action. The gods in Greek Mythology, when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield. Countless heroes and gods go to great lengths to alter their pre-destined fate, but with no success, as no immortal can change their prescribed outcomes by the three Fates. The most prominent example of this is found in \"Oedipus Rex.\" After learning that his son, Oedipus, will end up killing him, the King of Thebes, Laius, takes huge steps to assure his son's death by removing him from the kingdom. But, Oedipus slays his father without an afterthought when he unknowingly encounters him in a dispute on the road many years later. The lack of recognition enabled Oedipus to slay his father, ironically further binding his father to his fate.\n\nStories of heroism may serve as moral examples. However, classical heroes often didn't embody the Christian notion of an upstanding, perfectly moral hero. For example, Achilles's character-issues of hateful rage lead to merciless slaughter and his overwhelming pride lead to him only joining the Trojan War because he didn't want his soldiers to win all of the glory. Classical heroes, regardless of their morality, were placed in religion. In classical antiquity, cults that venerated deified heroes such as Heracles, Perseus, and Achilles played an important role in Ancient Greek religion. These ancient Greek hero cults worshipped heroes from oral epic tradition, with these heroes often bestowing blessings, especially healing ones, on individuals.\n\nThe concept of the \"Mythic Hero Archetype\" was first developed by Lord Raglan in his 1936 book, \"The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama\". It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world. Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.\n\nThe concept of a story archetype of the standard monomythical \"hero's quest\" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 work \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes such as Krishna, Buddha, Apollonius of Tyana, and Jesus. One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: \"The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin.\" In his 1968 book, \"The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology\", Campbell writes \"It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved Tammuz, Adonis, and Osiris cycles.\"\n\nVladimir Propp, in his analysis of the Russian fairy tale, concluded that a fairy tale had only eight \"dramatis personæ\", of which one was the hero, and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian folklore. The actions that fall into such a hero's sphere include:\nPropp distinguished between \"seekers\" and \"victim-heroes\". A villain could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers. Victims may appear in tales with seeker heroes, but the tale does not follow them both.\n\nNo history can be written without consideration of the lengthy list of recipients of national medals for bravery, populated by firefighters, policemen and policewomen, ambulance medics and ordinary have-a-go heroes. These persons risked their lives to try to save or protect the lives of others: for example, the Canadian Cross of Valour (C.V.) \"recognizes acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril\"; examples of recipients are Mary Dohey and David Gordon Cheverie.\n\nThe philosopher Hegel gave a central role to the \"hero\", personalized by Napoleon, as the incarnation of a particular culture's \"Volksgeist\", and thus of the general \"Zeitgeist\". Thomas Carlyle's 1841 \"On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History\" also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the biography of a few central individuals such as Oliver Cromwell or Frederick the Great. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.\n\nExplicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the philosophy of history school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, Karl Marx argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in \"class struggles\", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, Herbert Spencer wrote at the end of the 19th century: \"You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown...Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.\" Michel Foucault argued in his analysis of societal communication and debate that history was mainly the \"science of the sovereign\", until its inversion by the \"historical and political popular discourse\".\n\nModern examples of the typical hero are Minnie Vautrin, Norman Bethune, Alan Turing, Raoul Wallenberg, Chiune Sugihara, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, Oswaldo Paya, Oscar Biscet, and Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nThe Annales School, led by Lucien Febvre, Marc Bloch and Fernand Braudel, would contest the exaggeration of the role of individual subjects in history. Indeed, Braudel distinguished various time scales, one accorded to the life of an individual, another accorded to the life of a few human generations, and the last one to civilizations, in which geography, economics and demography play a role considerably more decisive than that of individual subjects.\n\nAmong noticeable events in the studies of the role of the hero and Great man in history one should mention Sydney Hook's book (1943) \"The Hero in History\". In the second half of the twentieth century such male-focused theory has been contested, among others by feminists writers such as Judith Fetterley in \"The Resisting Reader\" (1977) and literary theorist Nancy K. Miller, \"The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782\".\n\nIn the epoch of globalization an individual can still change the development of the country and of the whole world so this gives reasons to some scholars to suggest returning to the problem of the role of the hero in history from the viewpoint of modern historical knowledge and using up-to-date methods of historical analysis.\n\nWithin the frameworks of developing counterfactual history, attempts are made to examine some hypothetical scenarios of historical development. The hero attracts much attention because most of those scenarios are based on the suppositions: what would have happened if this or that historical individual had or had not been alive.\n\nIf the term \"heroine\" exists, \"hero\" is often the predominantly used term even though its neutrality can be put into question. The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.\nActs of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. Women in the military were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.\nIf their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of femininity ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their masculine counterpart.\n\nIf they get mentioned in history, the way their story is told also differs from their male counterpart, they are generally portrayed as young and beautiful, their actions are limited to a short time\nlapse in opposition to the possibility of a long heroic career for male heroes, underlying feelings that led to their heroic acts are underlined, overall less details about their life are kept and\nemphasis is put over their tragic death. Not to forget that heroes and heroines are part of a social construct, their history is told and changes throughout history to serve different purposes of memory, propaganda according to diverse social, political or religious evolutions.\n\nThe word \"hero\" or \"heroine\", in modern times, is sometimes used to describe the protagonist or the love interest of a story, a usage which can conflict with the superhuman expectations of heroism. A classic example is Anna Karenina, the lead character in the novel of the same title by Leo Tolstoy. In modern literature the hero is more and more a problematic concept. In 1848, for example, William Makepeace Thackeray gave \"Vanity Fair\" the subtitle \"A Novel without a Hero\", and imagined a world in which no sympathetic character was to be found. \"Vanity Fair\" is a satirical representation of the absence of truly moral heroes in the modern world. The story focuses on the characters Emmy Sedley and Becky Sharpe (the latter as the clearly defined anti-hero), with the plot focused on the eventual marriage of these two characters to rich men, revealing character flaws as the story progresses. Even the most sympathetic characters, like Captain Dobbin, are susceptible to weakness, as he is often narcissistic and melancholy.\n\nThe larger-than-life hero is a more common feature of fantasy (particularly in comic-books and epic fantasy) than more realist works. However, these larger-than life figures remain prevalent in society. The superhero genre is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes comic books, movies, toys and video games. Superheroes usually possess extraordinary talents and powers that no living human could ever emulate. The superhero stories often pit a super villain against the hero, with the hero fighting the crime caused by the super villain. Examples of long-running superheroes include Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Wonder Woman.\n\nSocial psychology has begun paying attention to heroes and heroism. Zeno Franco and Philip Zimbardo point out differences between heroism and altruism, and they offer evidence that observers' perceptions of unjustified risk plays a role above and beyond risk type in determining the ascription of heroic status.\n\nAn evolutionary psychology explanation for heroic risk-taking is that it is a costly signal demonstrating the ability of the hero. It can be seen as one form of altruism for which there are also several other evolutionary explanations.\n\nRoma Chatterji has suggested that the hero or more generally protagonist is first and foremost a symbolic representation of the person who is experiencing the story while reading, listening or watching; thus the relevance of the hero to the individual relies a great deal on how much similarity there is between the two. One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.\n\nIn the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"The Denial of Death\", Ernest Becker argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic survival mechanism. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the dilemma of mortality through heroism, by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's \"immortality project\" (or \"\"causa sui\" project\"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality. By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional \"hero-systems\", such as religion, are no longer convincing in the age of reason. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing \"illusions\" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. Terror Management Theory has generated evidence supporting this perspective.\n\n"}

Kalbi's father traced his roots back to early Muslim diplomat Dihyah Kalbi, while his mother traced hers back to the third Caliph Ali through his son - and Muhammad's grandson - Hussein ibn Ali. From his mother Amat Allah, he traced his maternal bloodline through Abu Abdillah bin Abul-Bassam Musa bin Abdullah bin al-Hussein bin Ja'far bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Musa bin Ja'far bin Muhammad bin Ali bin al-Hussein bin Ali bin Abi Talib; the attribution to the prophet Muhammad, at that point in the line, is also maternal as Ali was married to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah.\n\nKalbi's lineage was not universally accepted. While biographer Ibn Khallikan accepted the conventional telling of Kalbi's family line, historian Dhahabi disputed Kalbi's claim, making a counter claim that the latter's family tree could not be substantiated.\n\nWhile Ibn Diyha is generally acknowledhed to have been born in Valencia, conflicting reports have been given regarding Kalbi's exact date of birth. Ibn Khallikan held the view that Kalbi was born in March 1150, despite the fact that he was personally informed by Kalbi's son and nephew that Kalbi was born in February 1152.\n\nKalbi initially pursued the study of Islamic Prophetic traditions in Spain, visiting every major city in the country and learning from their scholars and academics. In order to further his studies, he traveled from Al-Andalus to Marrakesh, Morocco. Later, his study of Prophetic traditions took him through to Tunis in the year 590AH, then through Africa and on to Egypt, the Levant, Baghdad, Erbil and Wasit in Iraq, and Isfahan and Nisapur in Greater Khorasan. Kalbi was a student of Ibn Maḍāʾ, chief judge of the Almohad Caliphate, and held immense respect for his teacher, who he referred to as \"leader of all grammarians.\"\n\nIn addition to his renown as a linguistic scholar, Kalbi was also considered to be from the scholars of Prophetic narrations, which was actually his primary focus of study, despite his fame primarily being for his knowledge of Arabic grammar and philology. His number of students was considered high and his chain of narration is recognized by later scholars of the field. A number of these later scholars also narrated either directly from him or through his chain, such as Ibn al-Salah.\n\nWhile in Andalus, Kalbi was appointed as the judge of Dénia by the Almohads, but stepped down after public reaction to his sentencing a convict to cruel and unusual punishment. After his resignation, he sought further education in the Muslim east. After studying Sahih Muslim in Tunis in 1198, he performed the Hajj at Mecca and spent some time in Egypt. He sought further knowledge in the field of hadith in Syria, Iraq, Persia as far east as Nisapur before returning to Egypt.\n\nKalbi taught the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Kamil basic academic subjects and proper etiquette during the latter's youth. Later in life, Al-Kamil built an entire school for Kalbi to teach and pursue the study of Prophetic narrations. Al-Kamil would eventually replace Kalbi with his older brother Abu Amr bin Dihya al-Kalbi, also an expert in the Arabic language, as the director of the school, a position which the older brother held until his own death.\n\nKalbi died in Cairo on Tuesday, the 14th of the Islamic calendar month Rabi' al-awwal, in the Hijri year 633, corresponding to November 1235. He was roughly 89 years old according to the Islamic calendar, and 86 years old according to the Gregorian calendar. His death was during Ayyubid rule in what is now Egypt.\n\nHe was buried at the foot of the Mokattam mountain range outside of Cairo. His older brother, Abu Amr, died almost two years later in January 1237; he also died on a Tuesday, and was buried at the foot of the same mountain range.\n\nEvaluation of Kalbi's contribution to Islamic studies has been difficult due to his controversial nature among Muslim historians during the Middle Ages. Critics in the Muslim east have accused Kalbi of plagiarism and dishonesty, while those in the Muslim west praised Kalbi highly and referenced his education and efforts in learning.\n\nAt the request Al-Kamil, he wrote his most famous work: \"al-Motrib min Ashaar Ahl al-Maghrib\" \"\" (loosely translated: \"Rhymes from the poetry of the people of the Maghreb\") which was a collection of short biographies of the poets of Al-Andalus and Morocco, including their most famous poems. His work is extremely valuable as it preserved some of the oral traditions of the time as well as details of the poets' lives.\n"}

He is a Republican. The district is located in Williamson and Bell Counties just north of Austin. \n\nCarter was born in Houston, but has spent most of his life in central Texas. Carter graduated from Texas Tech University with a degree in history in 1964, and earned a law degree from the University of Texas School of Law in 1969.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Carter served as the first general counsel to the Texas House of Representatives’ Agriculture Committee. Carter later began a successful private law practice in Round Rock.\n\nIn 1981, Carter was appointed as judge of the 277th District Court of Williamson County. He was elected to the post a year later — the first Republican elected to a countywide position in Williamson County. He was reelected four times.\n\n\n\nA staunch fiscal and social conservative, Carter prides himself on having raised a family built on what he calls \"Texas Values.\"\n\nCarter is best known as the author of a law that made it easier to prove identity theft and provides stiff penalties for the offense. It was signed into law by George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nIn the 110th Congress, Congressman Carter has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills including the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, the Terrorist Death Penalty Act of 2008, and a bill condemning the vandalism of the Vietnam War Memorial on the National Mall. On the Appropriations Committee, Congressman Carter introduced an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to provide $12 million in funding to the section 287(g) of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA) which allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to delegate enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement allowing them to investigate, detain and arrest criminal aliens. However, this amendment was defeated in committee.\n\nAlso, when Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House of Representatives recessed in August 2008 for five weeks, Congressman Carter was one of many Republicans who stayed in Washington. This was part of a GOP protest, in which they claimed that Congress should not have recessed for five weeks without addressing the energy crisis many Americans were facing. The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that as of 2008 among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Carter had the second-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.\n\nOn June 12, 2009, Carter signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 1503, the bill introduced as a reaction to conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen.\n\nOn September 15, 2009, Carter called the 111th Congress a \"house of hypocrisy\" after the House of Representatives voted to rebuke South Carolina Representative Joe Wilson for his outburst, but would not go after New York Representative and House Ways and Means Chair Charlie Rangel, who has been the subject of numerous ethical problems involving taxes and property. Carter is also a proponent of the \"Rangel Rule,\" where IRS penalties and interest would be eliminated if one paid back taxes, similar to the treatment Rangel, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and former South Dakota Senator (and one-time Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee) Tom Daschle received after their tax problems were made public.\n\nCarter introduced a \"Privileged Resolution\" that would have forced the resignation of Rangel from his position as House Ways and Means Committee Chair after he declined to resign voluntarily citing the inaction of the House Democratic Caucus and the ongoing investigations as reasons. The resolution failed but it was noted that two Mississippi Democrats, Gene Taylor and Travis Childers, broke party ranks and voted with Republicans.\n\nAlthough a critic of the accuracy of Rangel's financial disclosures, Carter voluntarily amended his financial disclosure forms in mid-October 2009 to list nearly $300,000 in capital gains from the sale of Exxon stock in 2006 and 2007. Though Carter listed the sale of the assets, he did not list the actual amount of capital gains, on which he did pay taxes.\n\nOn November 16, 2009, Carter introduced legislation to give combatant casualty status to the victims of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, similar to those who were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn February 2010, after Charlie Rangel was found to have broken House rules, Carter again demanded that Rangel step down. Rangel later stepped down, avoiding a third attempt at a privileged resolution to remove Rangel.\n\nOn May 16, 2018, Carter was named the new chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Appropriations following the retirement of Charlie Dent. He had previously served as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations.\n\nCarter authored six bills, including H.R. 4854, the Justice Served Act of 2018, which was signed into law on October 9, 2018 and H.R. 1133, the Veterans Transplant Coverage Act, which was signed into law as a part of the VA MISSION Act of 2018. \n\nCarter signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018 which failed to pass the House. This legislation would have enhanced enforcement of existing immigration law, including important reforms to our legal immigration programs, enhanced border security, and provide a legislative solution for the current beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nCarter retired from the bench in 2001 in order to run for Congress in the newly created 31st District. After finishing second in the primary, he defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff — which was tantamount to election in this heavily Republican district. He has been consistently reelected without facing serious opposition.\n\nCarter originally represented a district that stretched from the suburbs of Austin to the fringes of the Houston suburbs, and also included College Station, home of Texas A&M University. After the 2003 Texas redistricting, however, Carter now represents a district stretching from the fringes of the Metroplex through more rural portions of Central Texas. Redistricting after the 2010 census made the 31st more compact, and it now comprises Bell County and Williamson County. The 31st District now includes Fort Hood, home of the U.S. Army's 3d Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Cavalry Division.\n\nIn the general election held on November 8, 2016, Carter won his eighth term in Congress. With 166,060 votes (58.4 percent), he defeated the Democrat Mike Clark and the Libertarian Scott Ballard, who obtained 103,852 votes (34.5 percent) and 14,676 (5.2 percent), respectively.\n\nIn the general election held on November 6, 2018, Carter won his ninth term in Congress.

{"id": "152995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152995", "title": "Kenny McCormick", "text": "Kenny McCormick\n\nKenneth \"Kenny\" McCormick is a main character in the animated adult television series \"South Park\", along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman. His oft-muffled and indiscernible speech—the result of his parka hood covering his mouth—is provided by co-creator Matt Stone. He debuted on television when \"South Park\" first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in \"The Spirit of Christmas\" shorts created by Stone and long-time collaborator Trey Parker in 1992 (\"Jesus vs. Frosty\") and 1995 (\"Jesus vs. Santa\").\n\nKenny is a third, later fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family. Kenny is animated by computer to look as he did in the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film \"\", in which his true appearance and voice was first revealed, and various \"South Park\" merchandise.\n\nIn a running gag most prevalent during the first five seasons of the series, Kenny would suffer an excruciating death before returning alive and well in the next episode with little or no explanation given. Stan would frequently use the catchphrase \"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!\", followed by Kyle exclaiming \"...You bastards!\" Since the show began its sixth season in 2002, the practice of killing Kenny has been seldom used by the show's creators. Various episodes have set up the gag, sometimes presenting a number of explanations for Kenny's unacknowledged reappearances. In the episode Coon 2: Hindsight it is revealed that Kenny is Mysterion, during this episode and continuing episodes (Mysterion rises,Coon vs. Coon and friends) it is also revealed that Kenny gets his immortal powers from the cult of Chutulu, due to the fact that his parents attended meetings before, they stated it was “just for the free beer”.\n\nKenny attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison's fourth grade class. During the first 58 episodes, Kenny and the other main child characters were in the third grade. Kenny comes from a poor household, presided over by his violent, alcoholic, unemployed father, Stuart McCormick. His mother Carol McCormick has a job washing dishes at the Olive Garden. Kenny has an older brother named Kevin. He also has a younger sister who is shown with his family in the season nine episode \"Best Friends Forever\", but does not appear until the 15th season episode \"The Poor Kid\", where her name is revealed to be Karen, whom he loves unconditionally. Kenny is friends with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Butters. Kenny is regularly teased for living in poverty, particularly by Cartman.\n\nKenny's superhero alter ego, Mysterion, first appeared in the Season 13 episode \"The Coon\", as a rival to Eric Cartman's eponymous superhero alter ego. He unmasks himself at the end of the episode, but his identity is left intentionally ambiguous. He is not revealed to be Kenny until the Season 14 episode \"Mysterion Rises\", the character's third appearance as part of a story arc.\n\nPrior to season six, Kenny died in almost every episode. The nature of the deaths were often gruesome and portrayed in a comically absurd fashion, and usually followed by Stan and Kyle respectively yelling \"Oh my God! They killed Kenny!\" and \"You bastards!\" Shortly afterward, rats would commonly appear and begin picking at his corpse. In a following episode, Kenny would reappear alive and well, usually without any explanation. Most characters appear oblivious or indifferent to the phenomenon, although occasionally one will acknowledge an awareness of it. In \"Cherokee Hair Tampons\", Kenny gets irritated and offended when Stan laments Kyle's critical condition while utterly ignoring Kenny's past demises. Eric Cartman commented on Kenny's deaths in the episode \"Cartmanland\", when he is being sued for unsafe rides insisting to attorneys representing his family that \"Kenny dies all the time!\"\n\nNear the end of the production run of the show's fifth season, Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kenny was killed off permanently. The reasoning behind the idea was to genuinely surprise fans, and to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters Stotch, a breakout character whose popularity was growing with the viewers and creators of the show. In the episode \"Kenny Dies\", Kenny dies after developing terminal muscular dystrophy, while Parker and Stone claimed that Kenny would not be returning in subsequent episodes. The duo insisted they grew tired of upholding the tradition of having Kenny die in each episode. Stone stated that thinking of humorous ways to kill the character was initially fun, but became more mundane as the series progressed. When they determined that it would be too difficult to develop the character because he was too much of a \"prop\", Parker and Stone finally decided to kill off Kenny permanently.\n\nFor much of season six, Kenny remained dead, though both Stone and Parker entertained the idea of eventually bringing the character back. According to Stone, only a small minority of fans were significantly angered by Kenny's absence to threaten a boycott of the cable channel Comedy Central, on which \"South Park\" is aired. For most of the season, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman fill the void left by Kenny by allowing the characters Butters Stotch and Tweek Tweak into their group, paving the way for those characters to receive more focus on the show. Nevertheless, Kenny returned from the year-long absence in the season six finale \"Red Sleigh Down\", has remained a main character since, and has been given larger roles in episodes. His character no longer dies in every episode, and has only been killed occasionally in the seasons following his return.\n\nThe first explanation given for Kenny's deaths and reappearances was given in \"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\", wherein the McCormicks have a baby exactly like Kenny, including the characteristic orange parka, shortly after the former Kenny dies. Mr. McCormick exclaims, \"God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened\", to which Mrs. McCormick quickly replies, \"Fifty-second\". This explanation is expanded upon in the Season 14 episodes \"\", \"Mysterion Rises\" and \"Coon vs. Coon and Friends\", in which Kenny, while playing superheroes with his friends, claims his \"super power\" is immortality. He actually dies several times during these episodes—even committing suicide more than once—reawakening alive and unharmed in his bed each time. He is frustrated and angry that no one can remember him dying every time he regenerates, and longs to know the source of his power, which he views as a curse. Unbeknownst to him, his parents were previously connected to a Cthulhu-worshipping death cult. After Kenny shoots himself the second time, Mrs. McCormick awakes with a scream, shrieks \"It's happening again!\", and minutes later, is shown gently placing a newborn Kenny in his bed. \"We should never have gone to that stupid cult meeting,\" she grouses as she and her husband return to bed.\n\nIn the episode \"Put It Down,\" he is killed off-screen by a driver on his phone, as his picture is shown among those of kids killed by driver on phone texting tribute.\n\nKenny has died 126 times in the \"South Park\" franchise (98 in the series, 12 in the shorts, 14 in the video games, and twice in the movie).\n\nWhen developing the character, the show's creators had observed that most groups of childhood friends in small middle-class towns always included \"the one poor kid\" and decided to portray Kenny in this light.\n\nAn unnamed precursor to Kenny first appeared in the first \"The Spirit of Christmas\" short, dubbed \"Jesus vs. Frosty\", created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated \"The Spirit of Christmas\" short, dubbed \"Jesus vs. Santa\". In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.\nKenny next appeared on August 13, 1997, when \"South Park\" debuted on Comedy Central with the episode \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\".\n\nIn tradition with the show's animation style, Kenny is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion. Ever since the show's second episode, \"Weight Gain 4000\" (season one, 1997), Kenny, like all other characters on the show, has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique.\n\nThe effect of Kenny's speech is achieved by Stone mumbling into his own hand as he provides Kenny's lines, while the recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader. As the technique of Kenny's muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane and sexually explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.\n\nHe first appeared unobscured by his hood in \"\", where it was revealed that he had messy golden hair. Mike Judge provided the voice for Kenny's one line of uninsulated dialogue: \"Goodbye, you guys.\" On a few occasions during episodes that have originally aired since the film's release, he has been seen without the parka; however, unlike in \"Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" his entire face has been only seen once in the television series without being partially obscured or otherwise altered, this being in \"The Losing Edge\". He also speaks unmuffled during some of these instances, in which case co-producer Eric Stough provides Kenny's voice. During \"The Coon\" episodes of seasons 13 and 14, Kenny has his first major speaking role as the character Mysterion.\n\nWhile most child characters on the show are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an \"underlying sweetness\" aspect to the character, and \"Time\" magazine described Kenny and his friends as \"sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence\". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode \"The Ring\", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed to find out that she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in \"Mysterion Rises\" in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her \"guardian angel\"), as revealed in \"The Poor Kid.\" In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.\n\nIn the trilogy of episodes \"Black Friday\", \"A Song of Ass and Fire\" and \"Titties and Dragons\", in which the boys play-act characters from the TV series \"Game of Thrones\", Kenny cross-dresses as a fantasy-style princess with a wig and dress similar to the video game character Princess Zelda, and becomes a Japanese-speaking moe anime character at one point. When Cartman complains, \"You're never going to be a real princess\", Princess Kenny responds (via her translator, Stan) angrily to Cartman, calling him a \"ball-licking lesbian\".\n\nThis portrayal continues in the video game \"\" where Cartman notes that playing a \"chick\" is \"just how [Kenny] seems to be rolling right now\". Kenny's sister also refers to Kenny as a girl, if you talk to her in the McCormick house. Throughout the game, Kenny posts 'status updates' referring to herself as \"the cutest of them all\".\n\nKenny's deaths are well known in popular culture, and was one of the things viewers most commonly associated with \"South Park\" during its earlier seasons. The exclamation of \"Oh my God! They killed Kenny!\" quickly became a popular catchphrase, while both Kenny and the phrase have appeared on some of the more popular pieces of \"South Park\" merchandise, including shirts, bumper stickers, calendars and baseball caps, and inspired the rap song \"Kenny's Dead\" by Master P, which was featured on \"\".\n\nThe running gag of Kenny's deaths in earlier seasons was incorporated into the season 9 (2005) episode \"Best Friends Forever\" when Kenny, in a vegetative state, is kept alive by a feeding tube while a media circus erupted over whether the tube should be removed and allow Kenny to die. The episode received much attention as it served to provide commentary on the Terri Schiavo case, originally airing just one day before Schiavo died. The episode earned \"South Park\" its first Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.\n\nKenny's deaths have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world. In the book \"\", an essay by Southern Illinois University philosophy professor Dr. Randall Auxier, entitled \"Killing Kenny: Our Daily Dose of Death\", suggests that the fashion of the recurring gag serves to help the viewer become more comfortable with the inevitability of their own death. In the book \"South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today\", University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point professor Karin Fry wrote an essay concerning the parallels between Kenny's role in the show and the different concepts of existentialism.\n\nWhen Sophie Rutschmann of the University of Strasbourg discovered a mutated gene that causes an adult fruit fly to die within two days after it is infected with certain bacteria, she named the gene \"Kenny\" in honor of the character.\n\nWatchMojo.com ranked Kenny as #7 on their \"Top 10 Best South Park Characters\" list. IGN ranked Kenny at #6 on their \"The Top 25 South Park Characters\" list.\n\nKenny had a major role in \"\", the full-length film based on the series, and appeared on the singing (albeit muffled) several lines of the song \"Mountain Town\" from the film. As a tribute to the Dead Parrot sketch, a short that features Kenny as a \"dead friend\" being returned by Cartman to a shop run by Kyle aired during a 1999 BBC television special commemorating the 30th anniversary of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". Kenny was also featured in the documentary film \"The Aristocrats\", listening to Cartman tell his version of the film's titular joke, and in \"The Gauntlet\", a short spoofing both \"Gladiator\" and \"Battlefield Earth\" that aired during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards.\n\nKenny also appears in six \"South Park\"-related video games: In \"South Park\", Kenny is controlled by the player through the first person shooter mode who attempts to ward off enemies from terrorizing the town of South Park. In \"\", a user has the option of playing as Kenny when participating in the game's several \"minigames\" based on other popular arcade games. In the racing game \"South Park Rally\", a user can race as Kenny against other users playing as other characters, while choosing to place him in any of a variety of vehicles. In \"South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!\", Kenny can be selected as a playable character used to establish a tower defense against the game's antagonists. In \"\", Kenny (as Princess Kenny) can be selected as a companion over the course of much of the game. In \"\", Kenny is seen as his alter-ego Mysterion.\n\n"}

Former President of Iran Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, referred to Saqafi as the \"closest and most patient\" supporter for her husband.\"\n\nSaqafi died on 21 March 2009, in Tehran after a long illness at the age of 96. Thousands of people attended her funeral, including the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei and then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Saqafi was buried next to her husband at his Mausoleum in Behesht-e Zahra. She was survived by her three daughters, Zahra, Sadiqeh, and Farideh.\n"}

Other surveys from online collaborative indices, such as Numbeo, Expatistan, or Eardex are not covered by this article.\n\nVarious factors enter into a city's cost-of-living for expatriate employees, such as monetary value, consumer confidence, investment, interest rates, exchange rates of the country's currency, and housing costs. This list does not account for cost-of-living savings accrued to local citizens through government-subsidized housing, health care, and education, differences in taxation, and many other factors irrelevant to expatriates. Cost of living may be much higher for expatriates than for local residents in a developing country, especially if expatriates expect a standard of living similar to a developed country.\n\nMercer's Cost of Living surveys are taken in March of each year.\n\nThe survey covers 207 cities around the world and measures the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. It is designed to help multinational companies and governments determine compensation allowances for their expatriate employees. New York is used as the base city and all other cities are compared against New York. The cost of housing plays an important part in determining where cities are ranked.\n\nTwo main factors determine a city’s ranking in Mercer’s survey – the relative strength of the relevant currency against the US dollar over the prior 12 months and price movements over the prior 12 months compared to those in New York City as the base.\n\nEvery March and September, ECA International calculates the cost of living for expatriates in almost 400 cities around the world. The survey does not include certain living costs such as accommodation, utilities (electricity, gas, water costs), car purchase and school fees. These are usually compensated for separately in expatriate packages from cost of living allowances.\n\n"}

Conflicting theories ascribe her a Venetian, Jewish or Greek origin. Her birth name may have been Cecilia Venier-Baffo, Rachel or Kalē Kartanou. Nurbanu was one of the prominent figures during the era known as Sultanate of Women.\n\nThere are several theories about the ethnic roots of Nurbanu, none of which is generally accepted:\n\nTurkish historian Ahmet Refik believed she was of Jewish descent, followed by some Turkish historians.\n\nIn 1900, Emilio Spagni claimed that she was a Venetian patrician, daughter of Nicolò Venier and Violanta Baffo, abducted on Paros when it was captured by Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa in the Third Ottoman-Venetian War. The Sultana, herself, would often say she was of Venetian patrician descent, but never named her family.\n\nIn 1992, B. Arbel challenged the view that she was really of Venetian descent. For him the most plausible theory is that she was a Greek from Corfou named Kale Kartanou.\n\nNurbanu became the most favored consort of Ottoman Sultan Selim II, who was put on the throne in 1566, and the mother of Murad III.\n\nWhile her spouse Selim still a şehzade, Nurbanu had been the head of his princely harem at Manisa.\n\nLike his predecessor Selim let his favorite wife remain at Topkapı throughout his reign.\n\nEven after Selim as a sultan began to take other concubines, she persisted as a favorite for her beauty and intelligence. As mother of the heir-apparent, she acted as an advisor to her husband.Although it was far from normal at the time, Selim II would often ask Nurbanu for her advice on various subjects because of his respect for her good judgment. Jacopo Soranzo, Venetian Ambassador reported: Her son became Sultan Murad III and Nurbanu became Valide Sultan (effectively “Queen Mother”), the highest position a woman could hold in the Ottoman Empire. She became a formidable figure with far-reaching influence during this time. According to some sources (Italian mostly, from Venetian accounts)& Some source's also remarked him as a devil sister.She became a figure with far-reaching influence during this time, so much so that Nurbanu Sultan effectively ran the government alongside the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmet Pasha. The Ottoman Empire was far from being very stable at the top and clashes over the imperial throne were common. It was also not uncommon for the loser to have his entire family massacred along with him to prevent any future challenge. Nurbanu Sultan was determined, however, that when the time came for her son to succeed his father, nothing would interfere with that.\n\nAt the end of Selim II's reign, the haseki Nurbanu received 1,100 aspers a day, while Selim's other consorts, each the mother of a son, received only 40 aspers.\n\nŞehzade Murad had been sent to serve as Governor of Manisa on the Aegean coast and was there when Sultan Selim II died in 1574. This would have been the perfect opportunity for someone to seize power with the Sultan dead and his son away from the capital. Nurbanu realized this as much, if not more, than anyone and took quick action. Security and privacy in the harem were the most strict anywhere and no one knew when Selim II had actually died. Nurbanu told no one and hid the dead body of her husband in an icebox and sent to Manisa for her son to come to Constantinople immediately. All the while no one was the wiser that Sultan Selim II had actually departed this life. It was not made known publicly until twelve days later when Murad arrived and Nurbanu delivered up the body of her late husband. Her son became Sultan Murad III and Nurbanu became Valide Sultan, the highest position a woman could hold in the Ottoman Empire. Unlike her predecessor Hürrem Sultan, Nurbanu outlived her husband and enjoyed absolute power between 1574 and 1583, although she was apparently not resident in the Palace after Selim II's death. Nurbanu had ultimate power, and she became a formidable figure with far-reaching influence. Canfeda Hatun, Raziye Hatun, and Hubbi Hatun ladies-in-waiting to Murad and Nurbanu also appear to have been very powerful and influential during his reign.\n\nAfter Nurbanu became the valide sultan to her son Murad III, she effectively managed the government together with the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, who acted as co-regent with the sultan during the Sultanate of Women. Her intermediary to the world outside the harem was her \"kira\", Esther Handali. \"Kira\" was so popular means of communication with the outside world when Nûr-Banû was the Valide Sultan that the two women were said to have been lovers. She corresponded with the queen Catherine de' Medici of France. Venetian accounts are the most prolific in describing Nurbanu Sultan as a woman who never forgot her Venetian origins.\n\nDuring her nine years of regency (1574–1583), her politics were so pro-Venetian that she was hated by the Republic of Genoa. Some have even suggested that she was poisoned by a Genoese agent. In any case, she died at the palace in the Yenikapı Quarter, Istanbul on 7 December 1583.\n\nDuring her nine years of regency, Nurbanu ordered the renowned Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan to build the Atik Valide Mosque and its surrounding külliye at the district of Üsküdar in Istanbul, where previously a \"Jewish bath\" was located. The construction of the külliye was completed and put in commission at the end of 1583, just before the demise of Nurbanu on 7 December 1583. She was buried at the mausoleum of her husband Selim II located inside the Hagia Sophia (then a mosque) at Sultanahmet in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nNurbanu died at Istanbul on December 7, 1583, during the reign of her son Murad III. She was buried next to Selim II in his mausoleum in the courtyard of Hagia Sophia, thus becoming the first wife of a Sultan to receive the honor of being laid to rest next to her spouse.\n\nWith Selim,Nurbanu is confirmed to have had at least four children, including:\nThough the claim remains disputed, several sources also mention her as the mother of:\n\n\nShe was portrayed by Turkish actress Merve Boluğur in television series \"Muhteşem Yüzyıl.\"\n\n\n"}

The third born of four Roberts children, he had an older sister, Rebecca Ann, who along with her husband, Marshall Nash, was killed in a plane crash in 1977, and an older brother, Ronald David, who died in 1982 in what was determined to be suicide. Robert's younger sister, Roberta Jean Potts, is a practicing attorney in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAs a young boy, Roberts watched his father travel the United States and the world conducting healing meetings where he would preach and pray for the sick. At times, his father and mother were gone for periods as long as six weeks. When school permitted, Roberts accompanied his father on trips and dreamed of having a healing ministry of his own; many times walking by his side as his father prayed for people in the \"invalid tent\". During the portions of the services where people were getting prayed for, Roberts was often standing on his chair clapping when people were healed.\n\nAt a young age, Roberts’s music talent was evident to those around him. At the age of 5 he had his first public performance at an Oral Roberts crusade in Baltimore, Maryland, standing on a chair in front of several thousand people singing \"I Believe.\" Also at an early age, his father began to teach him the game of golf. With his first swing of the club, while in their front yard, he sent a ball right through the living room window of their home. In his book, \"Expect A Miracle My Life and Ministry\" by Oral Roberts, Oral talks about the bond they gained through the game of golf. Roberts eventually became an excellent golfer and played with notable celebrities.\n\nThough drawn to ministry, Roberts was made uncomfortable by all the attention his father received. He was often teased by classmates and even teachers, and even got into fights about his father. \"I came home from school many a day with my shirt torn and my nose bloodied from being in fights with the other kids who made fun of me, my dad and the healing ministry of Jesus Christ.\" As a teenager, with the negative press his father was receiving and pressure from his father to sing at crusades, he began to pull away from involvement with his father’s ministry and began pursuing other talents and interests, such as singing. \nAs a teenager he learned to play the guitar and began singing in pizza parlors and eventually nightclubs around the state of Oklahoma. There was a new dream in his heart, to become a nightclub singer in Las Vegas. In 1966, during Roberts’ senior year in high school he played the lead in his high school play The Sound of Music. He then was offered a music scholarship for the summer to the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Traverse City, Michigan, by the founder Joseph Maddy, when Maddy brought a performing group to the Oral Roberts University campus. According to Roberts’ autobiography, he landed the male lead in the campus production of \"Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nGraduating from Memorial High School in May of 1966 Roberts was accepted to three different universities and chose the University of Kansas to attend college due to its well-known music program and it being the farthest distance from Tulsa. During the summer of his freshman year he worked at the famous 8,000 seat, outdoor Starlight Theater in Kansas City, with a number of performers including Shirley Jones. He also had been working in a number of night clubs and had been offered a contract to sing in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile at the University of Kansas, Roberts gets sick and had to go to the hospital, possibly needing surgery. The surgery was avoided but soon after returning from the hospital, while alone in his room, he heard a voice, coming out of nowhere, telling him he is in the wrong place. \"Where am I supposed to be?, he asks. The voice says, Oral Roberts University. In the Fall 1967, Roberts dropped out of the University of Kansas and enrolled in Oral Roberts University. In 1968 at the age of 19, two weeks before his birthday, Roberts dedicates his life to Jesus Christ and he joined his father’s ministry as a singer on television and in crusades. \nRoberts received his bachelor’s degree in communication arts from Oral Roberts University in 1985. He received his master’s degree from the Oral Roberts University School of Theology and Missions in 1992 as well as his Doctor of Ministry degree in 2002 from Oral Roberts University.\n\nAgainst the wishes of his family and friends, Roberts married Patricia \"Patti\" Holcombe on November 27, 1968. In his book, \"He’s The God of a Second Chance\", Roberts’ states, \"I was young and thought that I had all the answers to life. Of course, I didn't. I soon discovered that I had made a terrible mistake that I didn't know how to get out of. I did not believe in divorce. So I decided to make my marriage work.\" Together they have two children, Christi born in 1971 and Juli born in 1972. In 1978 Patti filed for divorce. In 1983, she released a book called \"Ashes to Gold\", discussing her thoughts on Roberts' ministry and university.\n\nWith his divorce hitting 300 newspapers nationwide and his position in the ministry, Roberts believed it was important to go before the executive staff of the ministry and the university to discuss his desire to remarry and seek their approval. They approved his request. Several weeks later, on January 11, 1980, Roberts married Linda Ann Salem at the campus chapel of Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida.\n\nTogether Richard and Lindsay had four children. After several miscarriages, their first child, Richard Oral, was born on January 17, 1984. Within hours, complications developed and he died 36 hours after birth. Jordan was born in 1985. Olivia was born in 1987. Chloe was born in 1989. Roberts has 3 grandchildren.\n\nAt 19, Roberts joined his father’s ministry and became immediately involved in several areas of the ministry including radio, television and traveling with his father on domestic and international crusades. His first trip was in December of the same year to Haiti singing with the music team, Oral Roberts Collegians. His first area of responsibility was reorganizing and developing the Collegians music group into the World Action Singers. Roberts and this group would be featured in the new Sunday morning television program, taped in Los Angeles and prime-time television specials that were taped in different locations around the world. \nOver the next decade Roberts sings on the television programs and produces more than 15 record albums. When not involved in television production Roberts travels the US and around the world performing in concerts and speaking at ministry sponsored events, as the ministry continues to raise funds to complete the building of the University. In addition, Roberts travels and sings in numerous healing meetings with Kathryn Kuhlman from 1973-1975.Kathryn Kuhlman from 1973-1975. \nRoberts’ world falls apart after his wife (Patti) files for divorce. In the book \"Expect a Miracle\", Oral Roberts remembers his son coming to his office devastated, explaining what had just happened, asking what was to become of him and his work in the ministry. Oral notes that numerous individuals, including close friends and ministers, advised Oral to remove Richard from the Ministry, send him overseas for a number of years and even disown him. After prayer, Oral believed that God was not through with Richard and he was still to be involved in the ministry.\nRoberts remarries and continues traveling doing concerts and singing on television. The concerts transform into a combination of music, preaching and ministry events where Roberts is praying for people and people are testifying they have been healed. In 1982, Roberts holds the first of many international crusades starting with South Africa. According to the ministry website, oralroberts.com, Roberts has ministered in over 40 countries on six different continents including: Russia, India, Brazil, Australia, Niger, and Indonesia.\nRoberts continues holding domestic meetings and ministering on television programs. In 1984, Roberts begins a live daily one-hour program called Richard Roberts Live that combines ministry, music and special guests such as Richard Kiel, known for his role as Jaws in the James Bond movies and Donna Douglas, best known as Elly May Clampett in the television show The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nIn 1985, Oral Roberts steps down and Richard Roberts is elected president of Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association (OREA) by its Board of Directors. In 1986, Roberts works with his father and helps found the International Charismatic Bible Ministries to support independent churches and ministries and to help expand opportunities for student recruitment for ORU.\nIn 1987, Roberts is elected as the executive vice president of Oral Roberts University and is involved in all areas of administration and presides over the ORU chapel services. During the same time period, Roberts continues daily television, domestic crusades with his father, his own international crusades and speaking at churches and conferences across the country. In 1992, Oral Roberts announces to the Board that he will be stepping down as President of ORU.\n\nOn January 27, 1993, the Board of Regents elected Roberts as the second president of the university. For Roberts, the excitement is short lived. Reports show the University is in debt as much as $52 million. Roberts stated: \"The University’s debt to asset ratio is not bad but it is operating at a deficit and spending $9 million a year in debt service.\" Tuition and fees were not enough to keep up with expenses. For years, the Ministry had been able to fund the short fall but it too was running tight budgets and not able to help as much as in the past. In his \"The Joy of the Lord\" book, Roberts talks about the daily pressure and concerns about cash flow. \"I spent most of my time putting out fires with bankers and creditors …and awoke many nights with nightmares of the University shutting down.\" \nRoberts assembled a team from his executive staff to work with him on resolving the financial problems. They meet each morning to review the bank balances and discuss the accounts payable that were due that day. Jeanne Alcott, Vice President of Partner Communications – \"Shortly after becoming President, Richard formed a special committee, a management team, to meet with him every morning concerning these seemingly impossible situations. Budgets had been cut and employees had been laid off.\" George Fisher – Vice President for University Development stated, \"I often wondered what people would have thought if they had known how little cash we had. Here we were, operating a $50 million enterprise with less cash in our bank accounts than many individuals have. Usually, after we conducted as much business as possible, the meetings turned into prayer meetings because we were so overwhelmed by the problems.\" \n\nRoberts pushes his team to increase enrollment, tighten budgets and find additional revenue streams. At the same time, Roberts uses his ministry television program to promote the University, increase enrollment and raise funds for student scholarships. He starts the Adopt A Student scholarship campaign as one of these efforts. In addition, he promotes special projects on the ministry's television program to help pay for needed university renovations. Over the next four years, enrollment increases by 1,200 students and the debt is reduced by 50 percent Roberts used his Ministry connections to help with recruitment, specifically in the African American community. Through his speaking at churches and conferences, he was mainly responsible for the 20% African American student body. ORU receives the Racial Harmony Award from the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities in 2002. \nRoberts recognizes the importance of the Athletic Program for national prominence and student recruitment. In 1993, Roberts makes a number of changes in the athletic program hiring Bill Self as head basketball coach. Roberts changes the school mascot from the Titans to The Golden Eagles and hires Mike Carter as the new Director of Athletics. \nAs president of the university, Roberts began incorporating the university and students as part of the crusade/healing rally team. Students and staff from the School of Nursing and staff from the School of Business join doctors as a part of the crusade team. Roberts has outreaches in Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana and Niger that include seminars and surgeries. Tulsa City Council presents ORU president Richard Roberts with a Key to the City of Tulsa to reflect their \"eternal gratitude for your efforts on our behalf.\" A proclamation was read regarding ORU’s contribution to the Tulsa community. In one semester, ORU students gave a total of 2,500 hours of their time in service to organizations in Tulsa.\n\nRoberts pushes to increase participation in the Oral Roberts University Educational Fellowship organization to expand the base of Christian elementary and secondary schools involvement to help bolster enrollment. He also focuses on international affiliation agreements. Students could attend classes as at various locations, acquire credit hours and potentially receive an accredited degree from ORU. During his tenure, agreements were signed with schools in Sweden, England, Korea, Singapore, Rhema Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow, OK, and Christ for the Nations in Dallas, Texas.\n\nIn October 2007, three former professors filed a lawsuit against Oral Roberts University and named the entire ORU Board of Regents, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, Roberts, his wife and several university administrators as co-defendants. As a part of the suit, additional allegations were made including: university resources were illegally used by Roberts to help a Mayoral candidate’s election campaign, Roberts misappropriated university funds for a daughter’s trip to the Bahamas, was maintaining a stable of horses at university expense for the exclusive use of his children, used university staff to do his daughters' homework, remodel the university-owned residence that Roberts lived in, 11 times in 14 years, allowed the university to be billed for damage to a university-owned golf cart inflicted by his children and personally acquired two vehicles, a Mercedes and a Lexus, through ministry donors. Roberts responded by saying, \"This lawsuit ...is about intimidation, blackmail and extortion.\" \nA few days later, the suit was amended, alleging the university’s financial comptroller had been fired; additionally amended stating \"Witnesses have reported voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoliation of evidence.\" One month later another wrongful termination lawsuit was filed against the university by a former ORU accountant, Trent Huddleston, that was employed for less than one year, claiming he had been ordered to help Roberts and his wife \"cook the books\" by misclassifying over $120,000 in funds, allegedly spent by the university on remodeling the university home that Roberts lived in.\n\n On October 17, 2007 Roberts asked for and was granted an indefinite leave of absence from the school by the university's board of regents, citing the \"toll\" the lawsuit and attendant allegations have taken on him and his family. In a statement Roberts said, \"I don't know how long this leave of absence will last... I pray and believe that in God's timing, and when the Board feels that it is appropriate, I will be back at my post as President.\" Billy Joe Daugherty of Victory Christian Center was named executive regent of the board of regents and interim president. Chairman of the board of regents George Pearsons noted the temporary resignation was not an admission of guilt.\n\nOn November 13, the tenured faculty of Oral Roberts University approved a nonbinding vote of no confidence in Roberts. The vote was nearly unanimous according to a professor in attendance.\n\nRoberts tendered his resignation to the university's board of regents on November 23, 2007, effective immediately. In an emailed statement he said, \"I love ORU with all my heart. I love the students, faculty, staff and administration and I want to see God's best for all of them.\"\n\nOn January 14, 2008, the ORU Board of Regents voted unanimously to name Richard Roberts president emeritus in honor of his work during 15 years as president.\n\nThe Huddleston lawsuit was dismissed, with ORU claiming he was nothing more than a disgruntled employee. Huddleston’s attorney stated there would be an appeal, but this never came to pass.\nIn a written statement, the university denied \"purposely or improperly\" destroying documents. Upon review, it was discovered that the shredded documents had nothing to do with any allegations and were a part of normal policy, required by law for the privacy and protection of students and ministry donors.\n\nBy October 2008, the original three cases for wrongful discharge had been dismissed or settled. \nNo evidence regarding the additional allegations made against Roberts or the university was produced. No charges were filed and all other lawsuits were dismissed.\n\nAfter stepping down as ORU President, Roberts focuses on what he calls his \"first love\", the healing ministry. Within weeks of being elected President Emeritus, Roberts conducts a crusade in El Salvador. Roberts is asked to relocate the ministry and Roberts moves the ministry to a new location a few miles from ORU on Skelly Drive.\n\nOn January 24, 2012, the birthday of his deceased father, Roberts was stopped in Tulsa, Oklahoma on U.S. Route 169 going 93 mph in a 65-mph zone in his Mercedes S430. After failing two field sobriety tests, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and for driving more than 15 miles per hour over the speed limit. He agreed to take a breath test, which measured his blood alcohol content at .11, above the legal limit of .08. On January 30, 2012 Roberts was charged with two misdemeanor counts, including driving under the influence of alcohol. At a May 2012 hearing, Roberts pled guilty to a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, speeding, receiving 18-months of probation and paying $1,532 in fees, assessments and court costs. He was also ordered to complete 56 hours of community service, undergo a drug and alcohol assessment, and attend DUI classes.\n\nRoberts’ nightly television program, currently called The Place for Miracles, continues, reporting over 125,000 testimonies received. Roberts has additional crusades, medical outreaches in Honduras, Guatemala, Kenya and Ghana. In addition Roberts, in association with his daughter Jordan, begins sponsoring the construction of a Christian school in Niger, sending multiple containers with millions of meals to a number of countries in Central America, Haiti, East and West Africa and working with Pete Sumrall of Feed the Hungry, assist with relief efforts after the devastating cyclone that hits the Philippines in 2013.\n\nIn 2010 Roberts began the School of the Spirit, currently called The School of Miracles. A free online school featuring the hallmark teachings of the Roberts family with over 25,000 registered students in over 70 nations around the world.\n\nRoberts also serves on the Board of Dr. Youngi Cho’s Church Growth International in Seoul, Korea.\n\n\n"}

He currently lives in Ufa, Russia.\n\nFidai began his professional career as a lawyer and spent more than 25 years in this profession. In 2013, during the economic crisis in Russia, he changed occupations to work full-time as an artist.\n\nHe entered art through digital photography, focusing on still-life photographs of fruits and vegetables. This was compiled into a series titled, \"The Quiet Life of Things.\" This series was presented at the exhibitions \"Metropolitan History\" in Moscow and \"Eros: The Times and Faces\" in St. Petersburg. In 2014, he experimented with expressionism and impressionism through paint. He created a series titled \"The Rainy City,\" which was presented in 2015 at \"The Muse Should Work\" in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 2014, Fidai started creating miniature paintings on matchboxes, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and grains of rice. Later that year, he began sculpting miniature figures out of pencil graphite. The process is challenging due to the fragile nature of graphite and it is common for the miniature sculptures to fracture after spending many hours on a single piece.\n\nFidai spends between six and twelve hours an average to produce a statuette, while complicated models take between two and three days to create. He uses a craft knife and a stereo microscope for creating the tiny sculptures. At first, he used jumbo pencils with a graphite diameter of 5mm. He now primarily uses lead between 0.5 and 2mm in diameter. His microsculptures have featured characters from movies and cartoons, animals, objects from popular culture, comic book characters, famous works of art, household items, and architectural icons.\n\nSalavat Fidai's microsculptures have been exhibited in London, Singapore, Los Angeles, Sharjah, and Saint Petersburg. Viewers are often provided with magnifying glasses to view the tiny sculptures.\n\n1.
