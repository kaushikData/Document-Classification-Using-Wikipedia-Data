In her time and place, she was the first woman ordained by the Hawaiian Evangelical Association, and the only woman Christian minister in the Territory of Hawaii. Her pastorate was primarily on the Islands of Maui and Molokai, where she helped restore the Siloama Church. Her childhood and young adult church life had been at Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu, and the board of directors of that church later offered her the position of Kahu (pastor).\n\nShe was born in Honolulu, the Kingdom of Hawaii, to Native Hawaiian mother Kuhilani Awai Kanaina (1861–1930), and Swedish sea captain father Andrew A. Rosehill (1851–1913) . Her siblings were sisters Minnie and Inez, and brothers Edward, Joseph, Francis and William. A stepbrother Frederick was from her mother's first marriage. Educated at Kaahumanu Elementary and Kawaiahao Seminary for Girls, she was employed as a book binder at the Advertiser Publishing Company in Honolulu when she met Maui sheriff Peter Noa Kahokuoluna. They were married in 1912 in the home of Kahu (pastor) Henry Hodges Parker of Kawaiahaʻo Church.\n\nThe Kahokuolunas were devout Christians, who kept their ties to Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu. Encouraged in her faith by Kahu Akaiko Akana, Alice attended Auburn Theological Seminary and Andover Newton Theological School. She was called in 1923 to shepherd Wananalua Congregational Church in Hana, Maui. Although she was a licensed minister, she had never been ordained. At the request of the congregants, the Hawaiian Evangelical Association officially ordained her into the ministry in 1925, the first woman the organization had ever admitted into the clergy. She became pastor of Wainee Church Church that same year. Her husband Peter died in 1926 after a lengthy illness. When Kahu Akana died in 1933, the board of trustees of Kawaiahaʻo Church offered the position to Alice, noting that she was the only ordained woman Christian minister in Hawaii, but she did not accept the position. On December 1, 1933, Kawaiahao held a year-end \"Praise Service\", with Alice delivering a Hawaiian language sermon.\n\nThe Siloama Church body of Christians had been formed at Kalawao, Molokai in 1866, by exiled people afflicted with leprosy. The Hawaiian Board of Missions erected the actual building in 1871. Over the years, the building fell into disrepair, and Congregationalists erected Kanaana Hou, the Church of New Canaan, at a different Molokai location in 1915. In 1938, Alice accepted a call to be pastor of the Siloama-Kanaana Hou churches, and spearheaded a drive to raise funds and restore the old Siloama Church. While searching through the abandoned ruins, Alice and Floyd McHenry, a naturalist affiliated with the Bishop Museum, discovered a vault beneath its foundation. Therein, they found its original 1866 record book. That discovery inspired Hawaiian historian Ethel Moseley Damon to write a book on history of the church. Japan's 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor, and the United States entry into World War II, caused a shortage of needed building supplies for the restoration effort. However, the efforts continued, and the restored Siloama was re-dedicated in 1948. Thereafter the congregants of Kanaana Hou Church worshiped at Siloama one Sunday each month.\n\nHer efforts at Molokai drew support from other churches and individuals in Hawaii. The choir she had organized participated in a congregational convention in 1951.\n\nShe never remarried or had any children of her own. For all her years of being in service to leprosy patients, she never contracted the disease herself. But by the end of her life, she was known as \"Mother Alice\" on Molokai for her selfless caring of others. No one who needed her was turned away, no matter the hour of the day or night. She was said to be \"a Hawaiian of quiet distinction, a vigorous, understanding woman of conviction and courage, but with a saving smile in her eyes ... \" Upon her 1957 death of cancer, a bronze plaque was created by Kanaana Hou Church to commemorate her life's service.\n\n"}

{"id": "483936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=483936", "title": "Baiyue", "text": "Baiyue\n\nThe Baiyue, Hundred Yue or Yue were various indigenous non-Chinese peoples who inhabited the region stretching along the coastal area from Shandong to southeast China, and as far west as the Sichuan Basin between the first millennium BC and the first millennium AD. Meacham (1996:93) notes that, during the Zhou and Han dynasties, the Yue lived in a vast territory from Jiangsu to Yunnan, while Barlow (1997:2) indicates that the Luoyue occupied the southwest Guangxi and northern Vietnam. The \"Han shu\" (漢書) describes the lands of Yue as stretching from the regions of \"Kuaiji\" (會稽) to \"Jiaozhi\" (交趾). In the Warring States period, the word \"Yue\" referred to the State of Yue in Zhejiang. The later kingdoms of Minyue in Fujian and Nanyue in Guangdong were both considered Yue states.\n\nThe Yue tribes were gradually displaced or assimilated into Chinese culture as the Han empire expanded into what is now Southern China and Northern Vietnam during the first half of the first millennium AD. Many modern southern Chinese dialects bear traces of substrate languages originally spoken by the ancient Yue. Variations of the name are still used for the name of modern Vietnam, in Zhejiang-related names including Yue Opera, the Yue Chinese language, and in the abbreviation for Guangdong.\n\nThe modern term \"Yue\" (; Zhuang: \"Vot\"; Early Middle Chinese: \"Wuat\") comes from Old Chinese \"*ɢʷat\" (William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart 2014). It was first written using the pictograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as \"越\". At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the \"Yángyuè\", a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC \"Yue\" referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people.\n\nThe term \"Hundred Yue\" first appears in the book \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" compiled around 239 BC. It was used as a collective term for many non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam.\n\nAncient texts mention a number of Yue states or groups. Most of these names survived into early imperial times:\n\nIn the 5th millennium BC, the lower Yangtze area was already a major population centre, occupied by the Hemudu (Austronesian) and Majiabang cultures, who were among the earliest cultivators of rice paddy fields in the fecund delta areas.\n\nBy the 3rd millennium BC, the successor Liangzhu culture shows some influence from the Longshan-era cultures due to trade and commerce.\nHowever, Y-chromosome DNA from Liangzhu culture sites shows a high frequency of haplogroup O-M119, which is also common among modern Taiwanese aborigines and speakers of Kra–Dai languages (formerly called Tai–Kadai) in southwest China.\nWucheng culture sites had a quite different profile, featuring haplogroups O-M95 and O-M122, which are found in several modern populations in east and southeast Asia, especially in Austroasiatic speakers.\n\nFrom the 9th century BC, two northern Yue tribes, the Gou-Wu and Yu-Yue, were increasingly influenced by their Chinese neighbours to their north. These two states were based in the areas of what is now southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, respectively. Traditional accounts attribute the cultural change to Taibo, a Zhou prince who had self-exiled to the south. However, this piece of information originates from Shiji by Sima Qian, who tended to assign Chinese ancestors to most non-Chinese groups. This practice, according to von Stella Xu, was used to justify the incorporation of non-Chinese people into his historical records. Sima Qian also assigned Chinese ancestor to King Goujian of Yue, claiming that he was descended from the legendary Yu the Great. It is common to craft ancestor myths for non-Chinese people that justify Chinese expansions when needed and also explain the difference between Chinese-ness and non-Chinese-ness.\n\nThe marshy lands of the south gave Gou-Wu and Yu-Yue unique characteristics. According to Robert Marks (2017:142), the Yue lived in what is now Fujian province gained their livelihood mostly from fishing, hunting, and practiced some kind of swidden rice farming. Prior to Han Chinese migration from the north, the Yue tribes cultivated wet rice, practiced fishing and slash and burn agriculture, domesticated water buffalo, built stilt houses, tattooed their faces and dominated the coastal regions from shores all the way to the fertile valleys in the interior mountains. Water transport was paramount in the south, so the two states became advanced in shipbuilding and developed maritime warfare technology mapping trade routes to Eastern coasts of China and Southeast Asia. They were also known for their fine swords.\n\nIn the Spring and Autumn period, the two states, now called Wu and Yue, were becoming increasingly involved in Chinese politics.\n\nIn 512 BC, Wu launched a large expedition against the large state of Chu, based in the Middle Yangtze River. A similar campaign in 506 succeeded in sacking the Chu capital Ying. Also in that year, war broke out between Wu and Yue and continued with breaks for the next three decades. In 473 BC, Goujian finally conquered Wu and was acknowledged by the northern states of Qi and Jin. In 333 BC, Yue was in turn conquered by Chu. After the fall of Yue, the ruling family moved south to what is now Fujian and established the Minyue kingdom.\n\nWhat set the Yue apart from other Sinitic states of the time was their possession of a navy. Yue culture was also distinct from the Chinese in its practice of naming boats and swords. A Chinese text described the Yue as a people who used boats as their carriages and oars as their horses.\n\nThe Yayoi people, the ancient people of Wa, in Japan are genetically and archeologically linked to the early people of the Yangtze-river and share several cultural aspects with them.\n\nAfter the unification of China by Qin Shi Huang, the former Wu and Yue states were absorbed into the nascent Qin empire. The Qin armies also advanced south along the Xiang River to modern Guangdong and set up commanderies along the main communication routes. Motivated by the region's vast land and valuable exotic products, Emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to send a half of million troops divided into five armies to conquer the lands of the Yue. The Yue defeated the first attack by Qin troops and killed the Qin commander. A passage from \"Huai nan tzu\" of Liu An quoted by Keith Taylor (1991:18) describing the Qin defeat as follows:\nAfterwards, Qin Shi Huang sent reinforcements to defend against the Yue. By 214 BC, Guangdong, Guangxi and northern Vietnam were subjugated and reorganized into three prefectures within the Qin empire. Qin Shi Huang imposed sinification by sending a large number of Chinese military agricultural colonists to what are now eastern Guangxi and western Guangdong.\n\nIn 208 BC, the Qin Chinese renegade general Zhao Tuo defeated the kingdom of Ou Luo and captured its capital. Towards the end of the Qin dynasty, many peasant rebellions led Zhao Tuo to claim independence from the imperial government and declared himself the emperor of Nanyue in 207 BC. Zhao led the peasants to rise up against the much despised Qinshi Emperor. Zhao established his capital at Panyu (modern Guangzhou) and partitioned his empire into seven provinces. Unlike Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Zhao respected Yue customs, rallied their local rulers, and forced local chiefs to be controlled by central government administrators, but let them continue their old policies and local political traditions. Under Zhao's rule, he encouraged Han Chinese settlers to intermarry with the indigenous Yue tribes through instituting a policy of “Harmonizing and Gathering\" while creating a syncretic culture that was a blend of Han and Yue (Tai) cultures.\n\nFollowing annexation of Nanyue, the Han dynasty set up two outposts which functioned as frontier garrisons. The Han court also established nine commanderies in the former territory of Nanyue and the whole area was made part of the Han dynasty proper. Nanyue was seen as attractive to the Han rulers as they desired to secure the area's maritime trade routes and gain access to luxury goods from the south such as pearls, incense, elephant tusks, rhinoceros horns, tortoise shells, coral, parrots, kingfishers, peacocks, and other rare luxuries to satisfy the demands of the Han aristocracy. Other considerations such as frontier security, revenue from a relatively large agricultural population, and access to tropical commodities all contributed to the Han dynasty's determination to regain control of this region.\n\nSinification of Nanyue was brought about by a combination of Han imperial military power, regular settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees, officers and garrisons, merchants, scholars, bureaucrats, fugitives, and prisoners of war. Northern and central China was a theater of imperial dynastic conflict and huge episodes of dynastic conflict sent waves of Han Chinese refugees into the south. Throughout the Qin-Han period, large waves of Han Chinese immigrants from the northern and central plains slowly penetrated southern China. The difficulty of logistics and the malarial climate in the south made Han migration and eventual sinification of the Yue a slow process. Describing the contrast in immunity towards malaria between the indigenous Tai and the Chinese immigrants, Robert B. Marks (2017:145-146) writes:\n\nAfter rebellions by Luo (Lac) peoples in 39–43 C.E., direct rule and greater efforts at sinification were imposed by the Han, the territories of the Luo (Lac) states were annexed and ruled directly, along with other former Yue territories to the north, as provinces of the Han empire. Division among the Yue leaders were exploited by the Han dynasty with the Han military winning battles against the southern kingdoms and commandaries that were of geographic and strategic value to them. Han foreign policy also took advantage of the political turmoil among rival Yue leaders and enticed them with bribes and lured prospects for submitting to the Han Empire as a subordinate vassal.\n\nMotivation of Han dynasty to expand to the southern parts of the present-day China was driven, in part, from a desire to capture the region's exotic and rare goods, the abundance of untapped natural resources as well as securing international maritime trade routes. Continuing internal migration of the Chinese during the Han dynasty eventually brought all the non-Chinese Yue coastal peoples scattered from Fujian to the Red River delta under Chinese political control and cultural influence. As the number of Han Chinese migrants intensified following the annexation of Nanyue, the Yue people were gradually absorbed and driven out into poorer land on the hills and into the mountains. Chinese military garrisons showed little patience with the Yue tribes who refused to submit to Han Chinese imperial power and resisted the influx of Han Chinese immigrants, driving them out to the coastal extremities and the highland areas where they became marginal scavengers and outcasts. Han dynasty rulers saw the opportunity offered by the Chinese family agricultural settlements and used it as a tool for colonizing newly conquered regions and transforming those environments.\n\nTraditional Chinese view about the world has it that China was located at the center of the universe, superior to other nations and peoples, and that whose who lived in the peripheral territories were less culturally advanced for their perceived lack of civilization, and thus peripheral peoples were considered as \"barbarians\". During the Han dynasty, it was advocated that Confucianism be used to re-educate and reform non-Han people as they were believed to be able to be culturally absorbed \"laihua\", \"come and be transformed\", or \"hanhua\", \"become Han\". Some administrators of Han sought to \"Confucianize\" non-Han people of the south under their authority through the additional establishment of Confucianist institutes and schools dedicated towards teaching the texts, philosophies and morality of the north, but at the same time they attacked and put down the traditional spiritual leaders of the southern community who were described as \"wu\", magicians or shamans.\n\nLarge numbers of Yue aborigines were eventually absorbed and assimilated into Chinese population while the remnants of the ancient Yue continue to live in the modern provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong. Speakers of the Kra–Dai languages—in modern China such as the Zhuang, Nung, Tay, Bouyei, Dai, Sui, Kam, Hlai, Mulam, Anan, Ong Be, Thai, Lao, and Shan—retain their ethnic identities.\n\nKnowledge of Yue speech is limited to fragmentary references and possible loanwords in other languages, principally Chinese. The longest is the \"Song of the Yue Boatman\", a short song transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC and included, with a Chinese version, in the \"Garden of Stories\" compiled by Liu Xiang five centuries later.\n\nThere is some disagreement about the languages they spoke, with candidates drawn from the non-Sinitic language families still represented in areas of southern China, Kra–Dai, Hmong–Mien and Austroasiatic. The hypothesis proposed by Jerry Norman and Tsu-Lin Mei arguing for an Austroasiatic homeland along the middle Yangtze has been largely abandoned in most circles, and left unsupported by the majority of Austroasiatic specialists.\nChinese, Kra–Dai, Hmong–Mien and the Vietic branch of Austroasiatic have similar tone systems, syllable structure, grammatical features and lack of inflection, but these features are believed to have spread by means of diffusion across the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, rather than indicating common descent. Chamberlain (1998) posits that the Austroasiatic predecessor of modern Vietnamese language originated in modern-day Bolikhamsai Province and Khammouane Province in Laos as well as parts of Nghệ An Province and Quảng Bình Province in Vietnam, rather than in the region north of the Red River delta.. However, Ferlus (2009) showed that the inventions of pestle, oar and a pan to cook sticky rice, which is the main characteristic of the Đông Sơn culture, correspond to the creation of new lexicons for these inventions in Northern Vietic (Việt–Mường) and Central Vietic (Cuoi-Toum). The new vocabularies of these inventions were proven to be derivatives from original verbs rather than borrowed lexical items. The current distribution of Northern Vietic also correspond to the area of Đông Sơn culture. Thus, Ferlus concludes that the Northern Vietic (Viet-Muong) is the direct heirs of the Dongsonian, who have resided in Southern part of Red river delta and North Central Vietnam since the 1st millennium BC . \n\nWolfgang Behr (2002) points out that some scattered non-Sinitic words found in the two ancient Chinese fictional texts, \"Mu tianzi zhuan\" 穆天子傳 (4th c. B.C.) and \"Yuejue shu\" 越絕書 (1st c. A.D.), can be compared to lexical items in Kra–Dai languages:\n\n\n“The Wú say \"yī\" for ‘good’ and \"huăn\" for ‘way’, i.e. in their titles they follow the central kingdoms, but in their names they follow their own lords.”\n\n伊 \"yī\" < MC ʔjij < OC *q(l)ij ← Siamese \"dii\", Longzhou \"dai\", Bo'ai \"nii\" Daiya \"li\", Sipsongpanna \"di\", Dehong \"li\" < proto-Tai *ʔdɛi | Sui \"ʔdaai\", Kam \"laai\", Maonan \"ʔdaai\", Mak \"ʔdaai\" < proto-Kam-Sui/proto-Kam-Tai *ʔdaai 'good'\n\n缓 [huăn] < MC hwanX < OC *wan ← Siamese \"hon\", Bo'ai \"hɔn\", Dioi \"thon\" < proto-Tai *xron| Sui \"khwən-i\", Kam \"khwən\", Maonan \"khun-i\", Mulam \"khwən-i\" < proto-Kam-Sui *khwən 'road, way' | proto-Hlai *kuun || proto-Austronesian *Zalan (Thurgood 1994:353)\n\n\n絕 \"jué\" < MC dzjwet < OC *dzot ← Siamese \"cod\" 'to record, mark' (Zhengzhang Shangfang 1999:8)\n\n\n“The Middle mountains of \"Gū\" are the mountains of the Yuè’s bronze office, the Yuè people call them ‘Bronze \"gū[gū]dú\".”\n\n「姑[沽]瀆」 gūdú < MC ku=duwk < OC *ka=lok\n\n← Siamese \"kʰau\" 'horn', Daiya \"xau\", Sipsongpanna \"xau\", Dehong \"xau\", Lü \"xău\", Dioi \"kaou\" 'mountain, hill' < proto-Tai *kʰau; Siamese \"luuk\" 'classifier for mountains', Siamese \"kʰau\"-\"luuk\" 'mountain' || \"cf.\" OC 谷 \"gǔ\" < kuwk « *k-lok/luwk < *kə-lok/yowk < *lok 'valley'\n\n\n\"...

The following are some examples cited from Bauer (1987):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Bauer (1996) points out twenty nine possible cognates between Cantonese spoken in Guangzhou and Kra–Dai, of which seven cognates are confirmed to originate from Kra–Dai sources:\n\nCantonese \"kɐj\" \"hɔ:ŋ\" ← Wuming Zhuang \"kai\" \"ha:ŋ\" \"young chicken which has not laid eggs\"\n\nCantonese \"ja:ŋ\" ← Siamese \"jâ:ŋ\" \"to step on, tread\"\n\nCantonese \"kɐm\" ← Wuming Zhuang \"kam\", Siamese \"kʰòm\", Be-Lingao \"xɔm\" \"to press down\"\n\nCantonese \"kɐp\" \"na:\" ← Wuming Zhuang \"kop\", Siamese \"kòp\" \"frog\"\n\nCantonese \"khɐp\" ← Siamese \"kʰòp\" \"to bite\"\n\nCantonese \"lɐm\" ← Siamese \"lóm\", Maonan \"lam\" \"to collapse, to topple, to fall down (building)\"\n\nCantonese \"tɐm\" ← Wuming Zhuang \"tam\", Siamese \"tàm\" \"to hang down, be low\"\n\nLi Hui (2001) identifies 126 Kra–Dai cognates in Maqiao Wu dialect spoken in the suburbs of Shanghai out of more than a thousand lexical items surveyed. According to the author, these cognates are likely traces of 'old Yue language' (gu Yueyu 古越語).\n\nJerry Norman and Mei Tsu-Lin presented evidence that at least some Yue spoke an Austroasiatic language:\nThey also provide evidence of an Austroasiatic substrate in the vocabulary of Min Chinese.\nNorman and Mei's hypothesis is widely quoted, but has recently been criticized by Laurent Sagart who suggest that on the most eastern coast Austronesian languages were spoken and in inland areas Austroasiatic languages.\n\nScholars in China often assume that the Yue spoke an early form of Kra–Dai.\nThe linguist Wei Qingwen gave a rendering of the \"Song of the Yue boatman\" in Standard Zhuang. Zhengzhang Shangfang proposed an interpretation of the song in written Thai (dating from the late 13th century) as the closest available approximation to the original language, but his interpretation remains controversial.\n\nThe fall of the Han dynasty and the succeeding period of division sped up the process of sinicization. Periods of instability and war in northern and central China, such as the Northern and Southern dynasties and during the Song dynasty sent waves of Han Chinese into the south. \nWaves of migration and subsequent intermarriage and cross-cultural dialogue has resulted to a mixture of Chinese and non-Chinese peoples in the south. \nLarge incoming waves of Han Chinese immigrants from Northern and Central China poured into the south over the centuries through various succeeding Chinese dynasties has resulted in large-scale intermixing between the Han Chinese and Yue with much of the indigenous Yue tribes assimilating into Chinese civilization or ended up being driven out into the hills and mountains.\nSuccessive waves of migration in different localities during various times in Chinese history over the past two thousand years have given rise to different dialect groups seen in Southern China today. Modern Lingnan culture contains both Nanyue and Han Chinese elements: the modern Cantonese language closely resembles Middle Chinese (the prestige language of the Tang Dynasty), but has retained some features of the long-extinct Nanyue language. Some distinctive features of the vocabulary, phonology, and syntax of southern varieties of Chinese are attributed to substrate languages that were spoken by the Yue.\n\nBy the Tang dynasty (618–907), the term \"Yue\" had largely become a regional designation rather than a cultural one, as in the Wuyue state during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in what is now Zhejiang province.\n\nIn ancient China, the characters and (both \"yuè\" in pinyin) were used interchangeably, but they are differentiated in modern Chinese:\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for being the evil brother of Lilandra and Cal'syee (the villain Deathbird), two important characters in the X-Men franchise.\n\nD'Ken first appeared in \"X-Men\" v1 #97 (February 1976), and was created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum.\n\nD'Ken inherited the throne of the interstellar Shi'ar Empire after his older sister, Deathbird, was exiled for murdering their mother and an unnamed younger sister. The Shi'ar's first known contact with Terrans is during D'Ken's reign. On Earth for an unknown reason, a Shi'ar scout ship encounters the private plane of Chris Summers (later known as Corsair). Also aboard are a pregnant Katherine Anne Summers and their children, future X-Men members Cyclops and Havok. The Shi'ar ship attacks the plane and kidnaps Corsair and Katherine. Their two sons are forced to share an escape parachute. Unfortunately, both parties come to believe the other has died.\n\nBrought to the Shi'ar Empire, D'Ken initially imprisons Corsair and takes Katherine to his royal bedchambers where he attempts to rape Katherine. As Corsair makes an unsuccessful attempt to escape from his holding pen, D'Ken punishes him by making Corsair watch as D'Ken stabs and kills Katherine. D'Ken then rips their unborn child from her womb. Corsair is made a slave while D'Ken keeps the infant alive with Shi'ar technology that also accelerates his growth. The third Summers' son, Vulcan is raised a slave and is sent back to Earth to be a servant to Erik the Red. Vulcan is able to escape and find refuge with Moira MacTaggert.\n\nMeanwhile, D'Ken seeks to expand the Shi'ar Empire and gain more power through finding and using the legendary M'Kraan Crystal. Ignoring others' concerns, he eventually located the Crystal, which is placed on an abandoned planet known only as The World. D'Ken's sister Lilandra Neramani opposes him, due to knowing that the Crystal was nicknamed \"The End of All That Is\" for a reason. She attempts a coup but is marked a traitor. While fleeing D'Ken's forces, Lilandra accidentally becomes psychically linked with Charles Xavier following his mental defeat of a Z'Nox invasion. Lilandra makes her way to Earth and allies herself with the X-Men. D'Ken's forces capture Lilandra and return with her, via Stargate, to The World to witness D'Ken's attempt to use the Crystal's power. The X-Men quickly pursue.\n\nThe X-Men arrive on The World and face off against D'Ken's Imperial Guard. Luckily, they are joined and assisted by the Starjammers, who had been attempting their own sabotage of D'Ken rule. The Phoenix Force, still weakened and unexperienced in using the new host body of Jean Grey, flies to the crystal to try to stop D'Ken, but is sucked into it, with everyone else. Inside the crystal, they find a large endless city, at the center of which is the heart of the Crystal - a sphere which contained a Neutron Galaxy. Due to its intense gravity, the Neutron Galaxy could cause all of creation to be sucked into it. Normally, an energy field in the form of a latticework, acted as a living shield but it was deteriorating due to the breach. Unfortunately, nearly all of those sucked into the Crystal are rendered immobile by a ray coming out of the orb that causes everyone to live out their greatest nightmares. Only Phoenix is unaffected. Using the empathic link she forges with the crystal, Phoenix discovers the imminent danger. Phoenix attempts to use her vast psychic powers to repair the latticework on her own but finds that even she is not strong enough. Phoenix reaches out telepathically to her fellow X-Men for psychic and spiritual support. With their combined will, Phoenix is able to repair the Crystal and save the universe from ultimate destruction. While most of those drawn into the crystal are able to escape unscathed, D'Ken experiences it's nightmarish effects more intensely and its immense power renders him comatose for a very long time. With D'Ken out of the picture, his younger sister Lilandra became the ruler of the Shi'ar.\n\nVulcan reawakens after barely surviving the failed rescue of the original X-Men from Krakoa. Driven mad by the experience and recalling the horrors of his past, Vulcan swears revenge on all those that he feels have wronged him, including D'Ken and the Shi'ar Empire. Vulcan heads back into outer space. While Vulcan is eventually captured by the Imperial Guard, he escapes when rebel Shi'ar who are against Lilandra's rule attempt to release fellow prisoner Deathbird. While on the run, the two former prisoners become romantically involved. Vulcan plans to resume his goal of vengeance, but Deathbird manages to convince him to delay his plans for a while. They travel to the planet where it is revealed that a comatose D'Ken has been protected and treated. Several telepaths have attempted to undo the damage that the Crystal had done to D'Ken's mind. All were unsuccessful and were either killed by the experience themselves or also left mindless. The most recent attempts, however, show that D'Ken's mind is almost functioning, only that the neural pathways are not connecting properly. As a favor to Deathbird, who did not want to rule the empire but did want to overthrow her sister, Vulcan offers to use his powers to assist the healing process. Knowing of Vulcan's enmity for the former Shi'ar ruler, the others are concerned but Vulcan assures them that his vengeance means little to someone in D'Ken's current state. Vulcan succeeds in redirecting energy and jumpstarts D'Ken's mind.\n\nD'Ken is grudingly grateful to Vulcan for reviving him. After he observes that Deathbird and Vulcan are romantically involved, D'Ken believes that bringing Vulcan into the family will help control the volatile situation. Due to Vulcan's \"birth\" in the royal house, D'Ken is able to invoking an ancient Shi'ar law that allows Vulcan to marry Deathbird and become part of the Shi'ar royalty. Vulcan agrees, but, following the completion of the wedding ceremony, Vulcan kills D'Ken, saying that since he and Deathbird were now married, he could claim the Shi'ar throne as his own \"By right of blood and combat! By right of succession!\" \n\nIt should also be noted that D'Ken was at one point believed to have some connection to the mysterious Adam X, a human-Shi'ar hybrid whom, according to Davan Shakari, was fathered by D'Ken and Katherine Summers, which led fans to believe he was the so-called Third Summers brother. With the revelation that Katherine was pregnant with Vulcan at the time D'Ken abducted her and the fact that he killed her soon after ripping Vulcan out of her womb, the Adam X scenario remains conjecture.\n\nD'Ken appeared in \"What If? X-Men - Rise And Fall of the Shi'ar Empire\" #1 in 2008.\n\nD'Ken was seen in the third season of the , in the five episode series , where his history was very similar to that of the comics. He was also responsible for the abduction of Cyclops's parents with Cyclops becoming an orphan on Earth. He also killed Cyclops's mother and imprisoned his father. D'Ken gained control over the M'Kraan Crystal in the series, however, which gave him overwhelming powers that drove him completely insane. When D'Ken was fighting Lilandra, the X-Men, and the Imperial Guard, D'Ken was eventually trapped by the Phoenix inside the M'Kraan crystal itself, in control of its vast power but unable to escape it.\n\nD'Ken is mentioned in the game .\n\n"}
{"id": "25703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25703", "title": "Demographics of Russia", "text": "Demographics of Russia\n\nThe demographics of Russia is about the demographic features of the population of the Russian Federation including population growth, population density, ethnic composition, education level, health, economic status and other aspects.\n\nAs of 1 January 2018, the population of Russia is 144,530,031 excluding Crimea and Sevastopol, whose annexation is not recognized by most UN members. Including Crimea and Sevastopol, the population is 146,880,432 as of January 1, 2018. Compared to the previous year, the population increased in Russia by 76,060, the result of a net migration gain of 211,878, and a natural population loss of 135,818. Around 77% of its population lives in European Russia, while the 23% lives in its Asian part.\n\nAs of 2017, Russia's TFR of 1.62 children born/woman was among the highest in Eastern, Southern and Central Europe. In 2013, Russia experienced the first natural population growth since 1990 at 22,700.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, ethnic Russians make up 81% of the total population. This share remained steady over the last few decades. Six other ethnicities have a population exceeding 1 million – Tatars (3.9%), Ukrainians (1.4%), Bashkir (1.1%), Chuvash (1%), Chechens (1%) and Armenians (0.9%). In total, 160 different ethnic groups live within the Russian Federation's borders.\n\nRussia's population density is 8.4 people per square kilometre (22 per square mile), making it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The population is most dense in the European part of the country, with milder climate, centering on Moscow and Saint Petersburg. 74% of the population is urban, making Russia a highly urbanized country.\n\nThe population of Russia peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, just before the breakup of the Soviet Union. Low birth rates and abnormally high death rates caused Russia's population to decline at a 0.5% annual rate, or about 750,000 to 800,000 people per year from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The UN warned in 2005 that Russia's then population of about 143 million could fall by a third by 2050, if trends did not improve. In 2018, the UN predicted that Russia's population will fall to 132 million by 2050.\n\nThe decline slowed considerably in the late 2000s, and in 2009 Russia recorded population growth for the first time in 15 years, adding 23,300. Key reasons for the slow current population growth are improving health care, changing fertility patterns among younger women, falling emigration and steady influx of immigrants from ex-USSR countries. In 2012, Russia's population increased by 292,400.\n\nThe number of Russians living in poverty has decreased by 50% since the economic crisis following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the improving economy had a positive impact on the country's low birth rate. The latter rose from its lowest point of 8.27 births per 1000 people in 1999 to 13.3 per 1000 in 2014. Likewise, the fertility rate rose from its lowest point of 1.157 in 1999 to 1.777 in 2015. 2007 marked the highest growth in birth rates that the country had seen in 25 years, and 2009 marked the highest total birth rate since 1991.\n\nWhile the Russian birth rate is comparable to that of developed countries, its death rate is much higher, especially among working-age males due to a comparatively high rate of fatalities caused by heart disease and other external causes such as accidents. The Russian death rate in 2010 was 14.3 per 1000 citizens.\n\nThe causes for this sharp increase in mortality are widely debated. According to a 2009 report by \"The Lancet\", a British medical journal, mass privatization, an element of the economic-reform package nicknamed shock therapy, clearly correlates with higher mortality rates. The report argues that advocates of economic reforms ignored the human cost of the policies they were promoting, such as unemployment and human suffering, leading to an early death. These conclusions were criticized by \"The Economist\". A WHO press-release in 2000, on the other hand, reported widespread alcohol abuse in Russia being used as the most common explanation of higher mortality among men. A 2008 study produced very similar results.\n\nA 2009 study blamed alcohol for more than half the deaths (52%) among Russians aged 15 to 54 in the '90s. For the same demographic, this compares to 4% of deaths for the rest of the world. The study claimed alcohol consumption in mid-90s in Russia averaged 10.5 litres, and was based on personal interviews conducted in three Siberian industrial cities, Barnaul, Biysk and Omsk. More recent studies have confirmed these findings.\n\nAccording to the Russian demographic publication Demoscope, the rising male death rate was a long-term trend from 1960 to 2005. The only significant reversion of the trend was caused by Mikhail Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, but its effect was only temporary. According to the publication, the sharp rise of death rates in the early 1990s was caused by the exhaustion of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign, while the market reforms were only of secondary importance. The authors also claimed the Lancet's study is flawed because it used the 1985 death rate as the base, while that was in fact the very maximum of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign.\n\nOther factors contributing to the collapse, along with the economic problems, include the dying off of a relatively large cohort of people born between 1925 and 1940 (between the Russian Civil War and World War II), when Russian birth rates were very high, along with, ironically enough, an \"echo boom\" in the 1980s that may have satisfied the demand of women for children, leading to a subsequent drop in birth rates.\n\nGovernment measures to halt the demographic crisis was a key subject of Vladimir Putin's 2006 state of the nation address. As a result, a national programme was developed with the goal to reverse the trend by 2020. Soon after, a study published in 2007 showed that the rate of population decrease had begun to slow: if the net decrease from January to August 2006 was 408,200 people, it was 196,600 in the same period in 2007. The death rate accounted for 357,000 of these, which is 137,000 less than in 2006.\n\nAt the same time period in 2007, there were just over one million births in Russia (981,600 in 2006), whilst deaths decreased from 1,475,000 to 1,402,300. In all, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births by 1.3 times, down from 1.5 in 2006. 18 of the 83 provinces showed a natural growth of population (in 2006: 16). The Russian Ministry of Economic Development expressed hope that by 2020 the population would stabilize at 138–139 million, and by 2025, to increase again to its present-day status of 143–145, also raising the life expectancy to 75 years.\n\nThe natural population decline continued to slow through 2008—2012 due to declining death rates and increasing birth rates. In 2009 the population saw yearly growth for the first time in 15 years. In September 2009, the Ministry of Health and Social Development reported that Russia recorded natural population growth for the first time in 15 years, with 1,000 more births than deaths in August. In April 2011 the Russian Prime Minister (Russian president as of 2012) Vladimir Putin pledged to spend the 1.5 trillion rubles (£32.5 billion or $54 billion) on various measures to boost Russia's declining birthrate by 30 per cent in the next four years.\n\nIn 2012, the birth rate increased again. Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, the highest number since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of 1.691, the highest since 1991. (Source: Vital statistics table below). In fact, Russia, despite having only slightly more people than Japan, has recently had nearly twice as many births as that country. The number of births was expected to fall over the next few years as women born during the baby bust in the 1990s enter their prime childbearing years, but this didn't occur thanks to the continued growth of the TFR. The figures for 2013-2015 again showed around 1.9 million births, about the same as in 2012, but because the number of women of childbearing age is dropping, especially for those in their early 20s, the TFR actually rose to 1.777, which places Russia at first 9 or 10 countries out of 50 developed nations, and at 6th place in Europe.\n\nIn 2017, the number of births took a drop because of another recession that hit Russia starting in 2014. However, the number of deaths also declined due to improving healthcare.\n\nIn 2006, in a bid to compensate for the country's demographic decline, the Russian government started simplifying immigration laws and launched a state program \"for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic Russians from former Soviet republics\". In August 2012, as the country saw its first demographic growth since the 1990s, President Putin declared that Russia's population could reach 146 million by 2025, \"mainly as a result of immigration\". Introduced in April 2014 new citizenship rules allowing citizens of former Soviet countries to obtain Russian citizenship If they meet certain criteria (e.g. preferred language, ethnicity) have gained strong interest among Russian-speaking residents of those countries (i.e. Russians, Germans, Belarusians and Ukrainians).\n\nContrary to the opinion of the media, Central Asia is only a tiny source of immigrants; out of 100,000 ethnic Uzbeks who arrived in Russia for work only 489 settled in Russia permanently. 50,000 Russian speakers from Uzbekistan arrived in the Russian Federation to settle. The largest amount were ethnic Ukrainians – 700,000 people by a far majority. However they came because of the Ukraine crisis (another thing to note is that they were legal when an overwhelming majority come undocumented). 1.4 million ethnic Russians repatriated to their homeland in 2014, more than in previous years. \n\nThere are an estimated four million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia. In 2012, the Russian Federal Security Service's Border Service stated there had been an increase in illegal migration from the Middle East and Southeast Asia (Note that these were Temporary Contract Migrants) Under legal changes made in 2012, illegal immigrants who are caught will be banned from reentering the country for 10 years.\n\nSince the collapse of the USSR, most immigrants have come from Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Belarus, and China.\n\nTemporary migrant workers in Russia consists of about 7 million people, most of the temporary workers come from Central Asia the Balkans and East Asia. Most of them work in the construction, cleaning and in the household industries. They primarily live in cities such as Moscow, Sochi and Blagoveshchensk. While worker migrants are opposed by most Russians, the mayor of Moscow said that Moscow cannot do without worker migrants. New laws are in place that require worker migrants to be fluent in Russian, know Russian history and laws. The Russian Opposition and most of the Russian population opposes worker migration, Alexei Navalny stated that if he came to power he would introduce a Visa regime to non-Eurasian Union countries in the former Soviet Union and have a Visa free regime with the European Union and The West to attract skilled migrants. The problem of worker migration has become so severe it has caused a rise in Russian nationalism, and spawned groups like Movement Against Illegal Immigration.\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.\n\nIn many of the following years, Russia has had the highest Total Fertility Rates of the world. These very high fertility rates did not increase even more the population due to the casualties of the Russian Revolution, the two world wars and political killings.\n\nNote: Russian data includes Crimea starting in 2014.\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian 77.7%, Tatar 3.7%, Ukrainian 1.4%, Bashkir 1.1%, Chuvash 1%, Chechen 1%, other 10.2%, unspecified 3.9%\nnote: nearly 200 national and/or ethnic groups are represented in Russia's 2010 census (2010 est.)\n\nRussian Orthodox 15-20%, Muslim 10-15%, other Christian 2% (2006 est.) Note: estimates are of practicing worshipers; Russia has large populations of non-practicing believers and non-believers, a legacy of over seven decades of Soviet rule; Russia officially recognizes Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism as traditional religions.\n\nRussian (official) 85.7%, Tatar 3.2%, Chechen 1%, other 10.1%. Note: data represent native language spoken (2010 est.)\n\nPopulation is heavily concentrated in the westernmost fifth of the country extending from the Baltic Sea, south to the Caspian Sea, and eastward parallel to the Kazakh border; elsewhere, sizeable pockets are isolated and generally found in the south\n\n\n8.4 people per square kilometer (2010 Russian Census)\n\n\"at birth:\" 1.06 male(s)/female\n\"under 15 years:\" 1.05 male(s)/female\n\"15–64 years:\" 0.4 male(s)/female\n\"65 years and over:\" 0.46 male(s)/female\n\"total population:\" 0.86 male(s)/female (2009)\n\nIn 2017, Russia's TFR of 1.62 children born/woman was among the highest in Eastern Europe, meaning that the average Russian family had more children than an average family in most other Eastern European countries, but that the rate was below the replacement rate of 2.1. After experiencing a surge in births for several years, Russia's birth rate fell in 2017 by 10.6% percent, reaching its lowest level in 10 years.\n\nIn 1990, just prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's total fertility rate (TFR) stood at 1.89. Fertility rates had already begun to decline in the late 1980s due to the natural progression of Russia's demographic structure, but the rapid and widely negative changes in society following the collapse greatly influenced the rate of decline. The TFR hit a historic low of 1.157 in 1999. The only federal subject of Russia to see a decline in fertility since 1999 is Ingushetia, where the TFR fell from 2.443 to 2.278 in 2014.\n\nIn 2009, 8 of Russia's federal subjects had a TFR above 2.1 children per woman (the approximate minimum required to ensure population replacement), These federal subjects are Chechnya (3.38), Tuva (2.81), Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug (2.73), Agin-Buryat Okrug (2.63), Komi-Permyak (2.16), Evenk Okrug (2.58), Altai Republic (2.36), Nenets Autonomous Okrug (2.1). Of these federal subjects, four have an ethnic Russian majority (Altai, Evenk, Ust-Orda and Nenets). In 2011, the highest TFR were recorded in Chechnya (3.362), Tyva (3.249), Ingushetia (2.94), Altai Republic (2.836), Sakha Republic (2.057), Buryatia (2.027), and Nenets Autonomous Okrug (2.007).\n\nUntil 2010, the Russian republic of Chechnya was the region with the highest birth rate in the former USSR (excluding Central Asia). However, in 2011, the Armenian province of Qashatagh overtook it (28.9 vs 29.3 per 1.000).\n\nIn 2010, the average number of children born to women has decreased from 1513 to 1000 women from 2002 to 1469 in 2010 in urban areas the figure was 1328 children (2002–1350), and in the village – 1876 (in 2002, – 1993).\n\nIn recent years the percentage of children per woman 16 years or more were:\n\nYear : 2002–2010\n\n1 child : 30.5%–31.2%\n\n2 children : 33.7%–34.4%\n\n3 children : 8.9%–8.7%\n\n4 or more children : 5.2%–4.2%\n\nno children : 21.7%–21.5%\n\nDespite a decrease in women who have not had children, the number of three-child and large families has declined between 2002 and 2010.\n\nIn every region in Russia, rural areas reported higher TFR compared to urban areas. In most of the federal subjects in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the total fertility rates were high, but not high enough to ensure population replacement. For example, Zabaykalsky Krai had a TFR of 1.82, which is higher than the national average, but less than the 2.1 needed for population replacement.\n\nCompared to the G7 countries, in 2015, Russian TFR of 1.78 children/ woman was lower than that of France (1.93), the USA (1.84), the UK (1.82). Yet its TFR is higher than in other G7 countries like Canada (1.61), Germany (1.50), Japan (1.46) and Italy (1.35).\n\nCompared to other most populous nations, Russia has a lower TFR than Nigeria (5.37), Pakistan (3.42), Indonesia (2.5), India (2.30), Mexico (2.19), the USA (1.84), and higher TFR than Brazil (1.74), and China (1.5-1.6).\n\nExperts were puzzled with a sharp increase in deaths coincided with a sharp increase in life expectancy. While they have found out that a decrease in potential mothers led to a decrease in births and a rapid rise in fertility.\n\nThe number of births during September 2018 decreased by 8,141 relative to September 2017, as for the period January–September 2018 births decreased by 61,595 compared to the period January–September 2017.\n\nThe birth rate for January–September 2018 was 11.0 births per 1,000 population versus 11.6 during the same period in 2017\n\nThe number of deaths during September 2018 decreased by 5,512 but for the period January–September 2018 total deaths increased by 5,584 compared to the same months of the previous year.\n\n\nThe death rate for January–September 2018 was 12.6 per 1,000 population, versus 12.6 during the same period in 2017.\n\n\nTotal natural increase during January–September has decreased to -1.6 per thousand in 2018 and increase to -1.0 per thousand in 2017.\n\n\n\"Further information:\" List of federal subjects of Russia by life expectancy\n\n\"total population:\" 72.5 years\n<br>\"male:\" 67.5 years\n<br>\"female:\" 77.4 years\n\nThe disparity in the average lifespan between genders in Russia is largest in the world. Women live 9–12 years longer than men, while the difference in lifespan is typically only five years in other parts of the world. David Stuckler, Lawrence King, and Martin McKee propose mass privatization and the neo-liberalist shock therapy policies of Yeltsin administration as key reasons of falling life expectancy of Russian men. As of 2011, the average life expectancy in Russia was 64.3 years for males and 76.1 years for females. According to the WHO 2011 report, annual per capita alcohol consumption in Russia is about 15.76 litres, fourth highest volume in Europe (compare to 13.37 in the UK, 13.66 in France, 15.6 in Ukraine, 16.45 in the Czech Republic, etc.).\nIn the late 1950s, the USSR claimed a higher life expectancy than the United States, but the Soviet Union has lagged behind Western countries in terms of mortality and life expectancy since the late 1960s.\nWhen controlling for confounding variables, neither alcoholism, poverty, pollution, nor the collapse of the health system explain the high male mortality. Most former communist countries got through the same economic collapse and health system collapse. Alcohol consumption per capita is as high in other East European countries. Poverty is high in many other countries. One factor that could explain the low male lifespan in Russia is violence, tolerance for violence and tolerance for risk, \"male toughness\". Violence, tolerance for risk together with alcoholism reduce the Russian male lifespan.\n\nThe life expectancy was about 70 in 1986, prior to the transition-induced disruption of the healthcare system. The turmoil in the early 1990s caused life expectancy in Russia to steadily decrease while it was steadily increasing in the rest of the world. Recently however, Russian life expectancy has again begun to rise. Between 2006—2011 the male life expectancy in Russia rose by almost four years, increasing the overall life expectancy by nearly 4 years to 70.3.\n\nIn 2012, 1,043,292, or 55% of all deaths in Russia were caused by cardiovascular disease. The second leading cause of death was cancer which claimed 287,840 lives (15.2%). External causes of death such as suicide (1.5%), road accidents (1.5%), murders (0.8%), accidental alcohol poisoning (0.4%), and accidental drowning (0.5%), claimed 202,175 lives in total (10.6%). Other major causes of death were diseases of the digestive system (4.6%), respiratory disease (3.6%), infectious and parasitic diseases (1.6%), and tuberculosis (0.9%). The infant mortality rate in 2012 was 7.6 deaths per 1,000 (down from 8.2 in 2009 and 16.9 in 1999).\n\nIn the 1980s only 8% to 10% of married Russian women of reproductive age used hormonal and intrauterine contraception methods, compared to 20% to 40% in developed countries.\nThis led to much higher abortion rates in Russia compared to developed countries: in the 1980s Russia had a figure of 120 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age compared with only 20 per 1,000 in Western countries. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 many changes took place, such as the demonopolization of the market for contraceptive drugs and media liberalization, which led to a rapid conversion to more efficient pregnancy-control practices. Abortion rates fell in the first half of the 1990s for the first time in Russia's history, even despite declining fertility rates. From the early 1990s to 2006, the number of expected abortions per woman during her lifetime fell by nearly 2.5 times, from 3.4 to 1.2. As of 2004, the share of women of reproductive age using hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods was about 46% (29% intrauterine, 17% hormonal).\n\nDespite an increase in \"family planning\", a large portion of Russian families do not achieve the target of desired children at the desired time. According to a 2004 study, current pregnancies were termed \"desired and timely\" by 58% of respondents, while 23% described them as \"desired, but untimely\", and 19% said they were \"undesired\". The share of unexpected pregnancies remains much lower in countries with developed family planning culture, such as the Netherlands, whose percentage of unwanted pregnancies 20 years before was half of that in Russia .\n\nThe Russian Federation is home to as many as 160 different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. As of the 2010 census, 80.90% of the population that disclosed their ethnicity (111,016,896 people) is ethnically Russian, followed by (groups larger than one million):\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census in Russia lived 142,856,536 people. It is important to note that 5,629,429 people (3.94% of the overall population.) did not declare any ethnic origin, compared to about 1 million in the 2002 Census. This is due to the fact that those people were counted from administrative databases and not directly, and were therefore unable to state their ethnicity. Therefore, the percentages mentioned above are taken from the total population that declared their ethnicity, given that the non-declared remainder is thought to have an ethnic composition similar to the declared segment.\n\nMost smaller groups live compactly in their respective regions and can be categorized by language group.\nThe ethnic divisions used here are those of the official census, and may in some respects be controversial. The following lists all ethnicities resolved by the 2010 census, grouped by language:\n\n\n\nThe ethno-demographic structure of Russia has gradually changed over time. During the past century the most striking change is the fast increase of the peoples from the Caucasus. In 1926, these people composed 2% of the Russian population, compared to 6.5% in 2010. Though low in absolute numbers, the Siberian people also increased during the past century, but their growth was mainly realized after WW II (from 0.7% in 1959 to 1.2% in 2010) and not applicable to most of the small peoples (less than 10,000 people).\n\nThe relative proportion of the peoples of European Russia gradually decreased during the past century, but still compose 91% of the total population of Russia in 2010. The absolute numbers of most of these peoples reached its highest level in the beginning of the 1990s. Since 1992, natural growth in Russia has been negative and the numbers of all peoples of European Russia were lower in 2010 than in 2002, the only exceptions being the Roma (due to high fertility rates) and the Gagauz (due to high levels of migration from Moldova to Russia).\n\nSeveral peoples saw a much larger decrease than can be explained by the low fertility rates and high mortality rates in Russia during the past two decades. Emigration and assimilation contributed to the decrease in numbers of many peoples. Emigration was the most important factor for Germans, Jews and Baltic peoples (Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians). The number of Germans halved between 1959 and 2010. Their main country of destination is Germany.\n\nThe number of Jews decreased by more than 80% between 1959 and 2010. In 1970, the Soviet Union had the third largest population of Jews in the world, (2,183,000 of whom 808,000 with residence in Russia), following only that of the United States and Israel. By 2010, due to Jewish emigration, their number fell as low as 158,000. A sizeable emigration of other minorities has been enduring, too. The main destinations of emigrants from Russia are the USA (Russians, Jews, Belarusians, Chechens, Meskhetian Turks, Ukrainians and others), Israel (Jews), Germany (Germans and Jews), Poland (Poles), Canada (Finns and Ukrainians), Finland (Finns), France (Jews and Armenians) and the United Kingdom (mainly rich Russians).\n\nAssimilation (i.e., marrying Russians and having children of such unions counted as Russians) explains the decrease in numbers of Ukrainians, Belarusians and most of the Uralic peoples. The assimilation is reflected in the high median age of these peoples (see the table below), as assimilation is stronger among young people than among old people. The process of assimilation of the Uralic peoples of Russia is probably going on for centuries and is most prominent among the Mordvins (1.4% of the Russian population in 1926 and 0.5% in 2010), the Karelians, Veps and Izhorians.\n\nAssimilation on the other hand slowed down the decrease of the number of ethnic Russians. Besides, the decrease of the number of Russians was also slowed down by the immigration of ethnic Russians from the former Soviet republics, especially Central Asia. Similarly, the numbers of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Germans, Jews, and other non-autochthonous ethnic groups has also been decreased by emigration to Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Israel, and so forth, respectively.\n\nPeoples of European Russia in the Russian Federation, 1926–2010\n\nPeoples of the Caucasus in the Russian Federation, 1926–2010\n\nPeoples of Siberia in the Russian Federation, 1926–2010\nRussia experiences a constant flow of immigration. On average, close to 300,000 legal immigrants enter the country every year; about half are ethnic Russians from the other republics of the former Soviet Union. There is a significant inflow of ethnic Armenians, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz and Tajiks into big Russian cities, something that is viewed unfavorably by some citizens. According to a 2013 opinion poll, 74% of Russians view the large number of labor migrants as a negative phenomenon. According to the United Nations, Russia's legal immigrant population is the third biggest in the world, numbering 11.6 million. In addition, there are an estimated 4 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia. In 2015, Ukraine-Russia was the world's largest migration corridor after Mexico-USA.<ref name=\"http://worldbank.org/\"></ref> According to the Armenian government, between 80,000 and 120,000 Armenians travel to Russia every year to do seasonal work, returning home for the winter. According to the Tajik government, at least 870,000 Tajiks are working in Russia. In 2014, remittances from Russia accounted for around one-third of Kyrgyzstan's and over 40% of Tajikistan's GDP.\n\nThe Kazakhs in Russia are mostly not recent immigrants. The majority inhabit regions bordering Kazakhstan such as the Astrakhan (16% of the population are Kazakhs), Orenburg (6% of the population are Kazakhs), Omsk (4% of the population are Kazakhs) and Saratov (3% of the population are Kazakhs) oblasts. Together these oblasts host 60% of the Kazakh population in Russia. The number of Kazakhs slightly decreased between 2002 and 2010 due to emigration to Kazakhstan, which has by far the strongest economy in Central Asia (Russia does receive immigration from Kazakhstan, but they are mainly ethnic Russians); other Central Asian populations, especially Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Kyrgyz, have continued to rise rapidly. (Turkmen are an exception; citizens of Turkmenistan do not have visa-free access to Russia.)\n\nRussian statistical organizations classify the immigrants based on their ethnicity, although there is an information gap between 2007 and 2013, In 2007, the net immigration was 190,397 (plus another 49,546 for which ethnicity was unknown). Of this, 97,813 was Slavic / Germanic / Finnic (51.4%, of which Russian – 72,769, Ukrainian – 17,802), Turkic and other Muslim – 52,536 (27.6%, of which Azeri – 14,084, Tatar – 10,391, Uzbek – 10,517, Tajik – 9,032, Kyrgyz – 7,533 & Kazakh – (-) 1,424) and Others – 40,048 (21.0%, of which Armenian – 25,719).\n\nMany immigrants are actually migrant workers, who come to Russia and work for around five years then return to their countries. Major sources of migrant workers but where permanent migrants of majority ethnicity of those countries are virtually nonexistent are in 2013. China 200,000 migrant workers, 1000 settled permanently. Uzbekistan 100,000 migrant workers, 489 permanent settlers. Tajikistan 80,000 migrant workers, 220 settled permanently. Kyrgyzstan 50,000 miagrant workers, 219 settled permanently. Macedonia- 20,000 worker arrivals, 612 settled permanently.\n\nPeoples of Central Asia in the Russian Federation, 1926–2010\n\nThe 2010 census found the following figures for foreign citizens resident in Russia:<br>\n, , : 5,300\nAll others: 41,400\n\nMedian ages of ethnic groups vary considerably between groups. Ethnic Russians and other Slavic and Finnic groups have higher median age compared to the Caucasian groups.\n\nMedian ages are strongly correlated with fertility rates, ethnic groups with higher fertility rates have lower median ages, and vice versa. For example, in 2002, in the ethnic group with the lowest median age – Ingush – women 35 or older had, on average, 4.05 children; in the ethnic group with the highest median age – Jews – women 35 or older averaged only 1.37 children.\nEthnic Jews have both the highest median age and the lowest fertility rate; this is a consequence of Jewish emigration.\n\nEthnic Russians represent a significant deviation from the pattern, with second lowest fertility rate of all major groups, but relatively low median age (37.6 years). This phenomenon is at least partly due to a high mortality rate among older people, especially males as well af the fact that children from mixed marriages are often registered as ethnic Russians in the census. The most noticeable trend in the past couple of decades is the convergence of birth rates between minorities (including Muslim minorities) and the Russian majority.\n\nThe following table shows the variation in median age and fertility rates according to 2002 census.\n\nRussian is the common official language throughout Russia understood by 99% of its current inhabitants and widespread in many adjacent areas of Asia and Eastern Europe. National subdivisions of Russia have additional official languages (see their respective articles). There are more than 100 languages spoken in Russia, many of which are in danger of extinction.\n\nRussia officially recognizes Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism as traditional religions. Russia has large populations of non-practicing believers and non-believers; many people identify only nominally with a religion. There is no official census on religion in Russia. The Pew Research Center found that 71% of Russians identified as Orthodox, with 1.8% Protestants, 0.5% Catholics and 0.3% other Christians. Pew estimated 11.7% of the population to be Muslim as of 2010. Estimates of practicing worshipers are:\nRussian Orthodox 15-20%, Muslim 10-15%, other Christian 2% (2006 est.). Only a small percentage of the population is strongly religious: about approximately 2–4% of the general population are integrated into church life (воцерковленные), while others attend on a less regular basis or not at all. Many non-religious ethnic Russians identify with the Orthodox faith for cultural reasons. The majority of Muslims live in the Volga–Ural region and the North Caucasus, although Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and parts of Siberia also have sizable Muslim populations.\n\nOther branches of Christianity present in Russia include Roman Catholicism (approx. 1%), Baptists, Pentecostals, Lutherans and other Protestant churches (together totalling about 0.5% of the population) and Old Believers. There is some presence of Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and other pagan beliefs are also present to some extent in remote areas, sometimes syncretized with one of the mainstream religions.\n\nAccording to the data of the 2010 Census, presented above, 88.26% of the people who stated their ethnicity belong to traditional Christian ethnic groups, 10.90% belong to traditional Muslim ethnic groups and 0.84% belong to traditional Buddhist, Jewish, Hindu and other ethnic groups.\n\n\"definition:\" age 15 and over can read and write\n<br>\"total literacy:\" 99.7% (2015)\n<br>\"male:\" 99.7%\n<br>\"female:\" 99.6%\n\nRussia's free, widespread and in-depth educational system, inherited with almost no changes from the Soviet Union, has produced nearly 100% literacy. 97% of children receive their compulsory 9-year basic or complete 11-year education in Russian. Other languages are also used in their respective republics, for instance Tatar (1%), Yakut (0.4%) etc.\n\nAbout 3 million students attend Russia's 519 institutions of higher education and 48 universities. As a result of great emphasis on science and technology in education, Russian medical, mathematical, scientific, and space and aviation research is generally of a high order.\n\nThe Russian labour force is undergoing tremendous changes. Although well-educated and skilled, it is largely mismatched to the rapidly changing needs of the Russian economy. The unemployment rate in Russia was 5.3% as of 2013. Unemployment is highest among women and young people. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the economic dislocation it engendered, the standard of living fell dramatically. However, since recovering from the 1998 economic crisis, the standard of living has been on the rise. As of 2010 about 13.1% of the population was living below the poverty line, compared to 40% in 1999. The average yearly salary in Russia was $14,302 (about $23,501 PPP) as of October 2013, up from $455 per year in August 1999.\n\nAccording to the FMS, as of 2011, there were 7,000,000 immigrants working in Russia. Half of these were from Ukraine, while the remainder was mostly from Central Asia. Only 3 million or less than half of all the immigrants are legal. Illegal immigrants number 4 million, mostly from Ukraine and the Caucasus. The Census usually covers only a part of this population and the last one (2002 Census) counted one million non-citizens.\n\nRussia is a highly urbanized country, with 74.2% of the total population (2017) living in urban areas. Moscow is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 17.1 million within the urban area. Moscow is recognized as a Russian federal city. Moscow is a major political, economic, cultural, and scientific centre of Russia and Eastern Europe, as well as the largest city entirely on the European continent. \n\nRural life in Russia is distinct from many other nations. Relatively few Russian people live in villages—rural population accounted for 26% of the total population according to the 2010 Russian Census. Some people own or rent village houses and use them as dachas (summer houses).\n\n\nCensus information:\n\n\n"}

Her entire renal system needed to be reconstructed. She has two older brothers. She can walk with the aide of a caliper, and also uses a wheelchair. , she is a horse riding teacher and student at the University of Western Sydney where she is majoring in sports and exercise science.\n\nDodd is a Grade IV equestrian competitor, coached by Peter Turner. Due to her sacral agenesis, when she rides her horse, she dislocates several bones every time, but as a result of anti-doping rules, she has had to find alternative ways of coping with pain associated with riding.\nDodd has been around horses since she was four months old, and was able to ride on her own by the time she was two years old, before she learned to walk.

{"id": "636105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=636105", "title": "Hebrew name", "text": "Hebrew name\n\nHebrew names are names that have a Hebrew language origin, classically from the Hebrew Bible. They are mostly used by Jews and Christians, but many are also adapted to the Islamic world, particularly if a Hebrew name is mentioned in the Qur'an (example: \"Ibrahim\" is a common Arabic name from the Hebrew \"Avraham\"). A typical Hebrew name can have many different forms, having been adapted to the phonologies of many different languages. A common Jewish practice worldwide is to give a Hebrew name to a child that is used religiously throughout his or her lifetime.\n\nNot all Hebrew names are strictly Hebrew in origin; some names may have been borrowed from other ancient languages, including from Egyptian, Aramaic, Phoenician, or Canaanite.\n\nHebrew names used by Jews (along with many Hebrew names used in Christendom) often come from the Tanakh, also known as the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament.\n\nMany of these names are thought to have been adapted from Hebrew phrases and expressions, bestowing special meaning or the unique circumstances of birth to the one who receives that name. \n\nTheophoric names are those which include a form of a divine name, such by adding the suffix אל \"-el\", meaning \"God,\" forming names such as מיכאל \"Michael\" (\"who is like God?\") and גבריאל \"Gabriel\" (\"man of God\"). Another common form of theophory is the use of the Tetragrammaton as the basis for a suffix; the most common abbreviations used by Jews are יה \"-yāh\"/\"-iyyāh\" and יהו \"-yāhû\"/\"-iyyāhû\"/\"-ayhû\", forming names such as ישׁעיהו \"Yəšaʻªyāhû\" (Isaiah), צדקיהו \"Ṣiḏqiyyāhû\" (Zedekiah) and שׂריה \"Śərāyāh\" (Seraiah). Most Christian usage is of the shorter suffix preferred in translations of the Bible to European languages: Greek -ιας \"-ias\" and English -iah, producing names such as Τωβιας \"Tōbias\" (Tobias, Toby) instead of \"Tobiyyahu\" and Ιερεμίας \"Ieremias\" (Jeremiah, Jeremy) instead of \"Yirmeyahu\".\n\nIn addition to devotion to Elohim and YHWH, names could also be sentences of praise in their own right. The name טוביהו \n\"Ṭôḇiyyāhû\" means \"Good of/is the LORD.\"\n\nJudæo-Aramaic was the vernacular language at the time of Jesus, and was also the language used to write parts of the Book of Daniel, the Book of Ezra, and the entire Jewish Babylonian Talmud. Aramaic remained the lingua franca of the Middle East until the time of Islam.\n\nJudæo-Aramaic names include עבד־נגו \"ʻĂḇēḏ-nəḡô\", בר־תלמי \"Bar-Talmay\" and תום \"Tôm\", as well as Bar Kochba.\n\nDue to the Hellenisation of the Eastern Mediterranean and the movement of Jews around the area, many Hebrew names were adapted to Greek, reinforced by the translation of the Tanakh in the Septuagint with many Hellenized names. \n\nMany of the names in the New Testament are of Hebrew and Aramaic origin, but were adapted to the Greek by Hellenistic Christian writers such as Paul of Tarsus. \n\nSuch Hebræo-Greek names include Ἰησοῦς \"Iēsous\" (originally from ישׁוע \"Yēšûªʻ\"), Νῶε \"Nōē\" (originally from נח \"Nōªḥ\"), Ἰσαΐας \"Isaias\" (originally from ישׁעיהו \"Yəšaʻªyāhû\"), Ἰσραήλ \"Israēl\" (originally from ישראל \"Yiśrā’ēl\"). \n\nAlso, some Jews of the time had Greek Gentile names themselves, such as the Christian Luke (Greek Λουκᾶς \"Loukas\"). Though used by some Jews at the time, these names are generally not associated with Jews today, and are considered characteristically Greek and largely confined to use by Christians. Hebrew forms of the names exist, but they are extremely rare.\n\nMany Hebrew names were adapted into Latin, some via Greek. Such names include Jesus (from Greek Ιησους \"Iēsous\") and Maria (from Greek Μαριαμ \"Mariam\", originally from Hebrew מרים \"Miryām\").\n\nAlso, some Jews during Roman times also had Latin names for themselves, such as the Christian evangelist Mark (Latin Marcus). As was the case with contemporary Jewish names of Greek origin, most of these Latin names are generally not associated with Jews today, and today retain a Roman and Christian character.\n\nWith the rise of Islam and the establishment of an Arab Caliphate, the Arabic language became the lingua franca of the Middle East and some parts of Berber North Africa. Islamic scripture such as the Qurʼan, however, contains many names of Hebrew origin (often via Aramaic), and there were Jewish and Christian minorities living under Arab Islamic rule. As such, many Hebrew names had been adapted to Arabic, and could be found in the Arab world. Jews and Christians generally used the Arabic adaptions of these names, just as in the present English-speaking Jews (and sometimes Muslims) often use Anglicized versions (Joshua rather than Yəhôšúªʼ, for instance.)\n\nWhile most such names are common to traditional Arabic translations of the Bible, a few differ; for instance, Arabic-speaking Christians use \"Yasūʻ\" instead of \"ʻĪsā\" for \"Jesus\".\n\nSuch Hebræo-Arabic names include:\n\n\nThe influence of Aramaic is observable in several names, notably ʼIsḥāq (Isaac), where the Syriac form is simply \"Îsḥāq\", contrasting with more Hebraic forms such as Yaʻqūb (Jacob).\n\nSome of these Arabic names preserve original Hebrew pronunciations that were later changed by regular sound shifts; \"migdal\", recorded in the New Testament as \"Magdal\"ene and in Palestinian Arabic as \"Majdala\", which turned \"a\" in unstressed closed syllables into \"i\".\n\nTypically, Hebrew אל \"-ʼēl\" was adapted as ـايل \"-īl\", and Hebrew יה \"-yāh\" as ـيا \"-yāʼ\".\n\nJames I of England commissioned a translation of the Christian Bible from the original languages, including a translation of the Tanakh or Old Testament from Hebrew into English. This became known as the King James Version of the Bible, often referred to today by the abbreviation \"KJV.\" \n\nEven so, many KJV Old Testament names were not entirely without New Testament Greek influence. This influence mostly reflected the vowels of names, leaving most of the consonants largely intact, only modestly filtered to consonants of contemporary English phonology. However, all KJV names followed the Greek convention of not distinguishing between soft and \"dāḡeš\" forms of ב \"bêṯ\". These habits resulted in multilingually fused Hebræo-Helleno-English names, such as Judah, Isaiah and Jeremiah. Additionally, a handful of names were adapted directly from Greek without even partial translations from Hebrew, including names such as Isaac, Moses and Jesse.\n\nAlong with names from the KJV edition of the New Testament, these names constitute the large part of Hebrew names as they exist in the English-speaking world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1156581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1156581", "title": "Jewish name", "text": "Jewish name\n\nThe Jewish name has historically varied, encompassing throughout the centuries several different traditions. This article looks at the onomastics practices of the Jewish people, that is, the history of the origin and forms of proper names.\n\nJews have historically used Hebrew patronymic names. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either ben- or bat- (\"son of\" and \"daughter of,\" respectively), and then the father's name. (Bar-, \"son of\" in Aramaic, is also seen). Permanent family surnames exist today but only gained popularity among Sephardic Jews in Iberia and elsewhere as early as the 10th or 11th century and did not spread widely to the Ashkenazic Jews of Germany or Eastern Europe until the 18th and 19th century, where the adoption of German surnames was imposed in exchange for Jewish emancipation. An exception was members of the Cohanim (priestly caste) and Levites (descendants of Levi) who performed certain religious duties, who had always appended the surname Cohen and Levi respectively (modern spelling in English may vary) which was usually preceded by \"ha\" meaning \"the\" in Hebrew.\n\nAlthough Ashkenazi Jews now use European or modern-Hebrew surnames for everyday life, the Hebrew patronymic form is still used in Jewish religious and cultural life. It is used in synagogue and in documents in Jewish law such as the ketubah (marriage contract).\n\nThe name conferred upon a person in early Biblical times was generally connected with some circumstance of that person's birth—several of Jacob's sons are recorded as having received their names in this manner (Genesis 30). Generally, it was the mother who chose the name, as in the case of Jacob's sons, but there were occasions on which the father chose the child's name, such as in Genesis 16:15, 17:19, and 21:2. Occasionally, persons other than the parents were the name-givers, as in the cases of Moses (Exodus 2:10) and Solomon (II Samuel 12:25).\n\nIt appears to have been the custom in early Biblical times to confer a name immediately upon birth, but in later periods a name was given to a boy at circumcision (compare Luke 1:59 to 2:21). Before the Babylonian exile, it was not common practice to name children after their relatives, even in the royal family—none of the twenty-one kings of Judah was named after a predecessor, or after David, the founder of the dynasty. On the other hand, a son of Jonathan and of King Saul were each named Meribaal (II Samuel 21:7 and following). Instead of repeating the exact name of an ancestor, however, it was customary to make use of one of the elements of the family name. Thus, Ahitub has two sons, Ahijah and Ahimelech. Three of Saul's family members have the element \"ba'al\" (in the altered form \"bosheth\") in their names. As a consequence of this avoidance of repetition, a single name was as a rule sufficient to identify a person. It became traditional to identify a son by his father's name and a chosen name, like Jaazaniah ben Shaphan (Ezekiel 8:11) only in later years of Hebrew history.\n\nIt is probable that, as in other ancient societies, a name carried spiritual significance. A large majority of the 2,800 personal names found in the Hebrew Bible (shared among about 15,000 persons) convey a specific meaning. The meanings of the remainder have been obscured either through textual corruption or insufficient current understanding of comparative philology. In addition, a considerable number of these names are probably eponyms. There is little doubt that this applies to the names of the Israelite clans, each of which was assumed to be descended from the descendants of Jacob, described in Numbers 26.\n\nNames may be derived from the order of birth, as in the cases of Akkub and Jacob, whose names probably mean \"posthumous.\" Jephthah implies \"first-born\", as does Becher, while names like Manasseh, Nahum, and Nehemiah refer probably to children who have come to take the place of others that have died in childhood. The idea of relationship is expressed in Ahab, probably originally Ahiab (Jeremiah 29:21).\n\nPersonal peculiarities may give rise to a name, as Laban (\"white\", or \"blond\"), Gideon (\"maimed\"), or Harim (\"with pierced nose\"). Personality may be referred to, as in the names Job (\"assailant\") and Barak (\"lightning\"). There are no occupational names in the Bible corresponding to Anglo-Saxon names like Smith of England or Müller of Germany, but names taken from objects are found, especially among females. The name Rebecca (\"Rivka\") seems to be derived from a sheep-rope, Peninnah from pearl, and Keren-happuch from a box of face-paint. Abstract names seem to have been given primarily to women, such as Manoah (\"rest\") and Michal (\"power\").\n\nJacobs gives eighty-four names (applied to 120 different persons) derived from animals and plants. Leah is generally known as a word for cow, and Rachel for ewe (appropriate since both are considered matriarchs). Oreb (\"raven\") and Ze'ev (\"wolf\") were princes of the Midianites (although Ze'ev was also an appellation of Benjamin), and Caleb (\"the dog\") was the founder of the chief Judean tribe. Achbor (\"mouse\") and Shaphan (\"coney\") also occur. Jonah is the equivalent of \"dove\", Zipporah of \"bird\", and Deborah of \"bee.\" Esther's Jewish name, Hadassah, means \"myrtle.\" Citing these animal-inspired names, Robertson Smith and others have attempted to find evidence of totemism among the ancient Hebrews.\n\nOther Jewish names taken from animals include Ari (lion), Ariel means (\"God is my lion\"), Dov (bear), and Tzvi or Zvi (deer).\n\nA distinctive characteristic of Bible onomastics is the frequency of composite names, which form at times even complete sentences, as in the case of Isaiah's son Shear-jashub (\"the remnant shall return\") and Hephzibah (\"my pleasure is in her\"). Sometimes these composites have a preposition as their first element, as Bishlam (= \"with peace\"; Ezra 4:7) and Lemuel (\"belonging to God\"; Proverbs 31:4); but in the majority of cases these composite names are theophorous, referring to, or actually mentioning, the Deity, either by the name of YHWH or by the name of El. The specific name of the Hebrew God appears at the beginning as \"Jo-\" and at the end as \"-iah\"; thus, \"Jonathan\" is a doublet of \"Elnathan\", and \"Joezer\" (\"YHWH is help\") is the same as \"Joazar\" (\"YHWH has helped\"). A whole theology may be deduced from the large number of Biblical names referring to acts, actions, and attributes of the deity; thus: YHWH \"gives\" (Elnathan, Jonathan, Nathaniel); \"increases the family\" (Eliasaph, Joseph); \"is gracious\" (Elhanan, Hananeel, John, Hananiah); \"has mercy\" (Jerahmeel); \"blesses\" (Barachel, Berechiah); \"loves\" (Jedidiah, Eldad); \"helps\" (Eleazar, Azareel, Azariah); \"benefits\" (Gamaliel); \"holds fast\" (Jehoahaz, Ahaziah); \"is strong\" (Uzziel, Azaziah, Uzziah); \"delivers\" (Elpalet, Eliphalet); \"comforts\" (Nehemiah); \"heals\" (Rephael); \"conceals\" (Elzaphan, Zephaniah); \"establishes\" (Eliakim, Jehoiakim); \"knows\" (Eliada, Jehoiada); \"remembers\" (Zechariah); \"sees\" (Hazael, Jahaziel); \"hears\" (Elishama, Hoshama); \"answers\" (Anaiah, Ananiah, Janai); \"speaks\" (Amariah); \"is praised\" (Jehaleel); \"is asked\" (Shealtiel); \"comes\" (Eliathah); \"lives\" (Jehiel); \"exalts/uplifts\" (Jeremiah); \"thunders\" (Raamiah; Nehemiah 7:7); \"gladdens\" (Jahdiel, Jehdeiah); \"judges\" (Elishaphat, Jehoshaphat, Shephatiah, Daniel); \"is just\" (Jehozadak, Zedekiah); \"is king\" (Elimelech, Malchiel); \"is lord\" (Bealiah); \"is great\" (Gedaliah); \"is perfect\" (Jotham); \"is high\" (Jehoram); \"is glorious\" (Jochebed); \"is incomparable\" (Michael, literally \"who is like God?\")\n\nBesides these distinct names of God other divine names are used, as \"Adoni\" in Adoniram, and \"Melech\" in Nathan-melech and Ebed-melech, and Baal in Esh-baal (changed for special reasons to Ishbosheth). In some cases names of relationship seem to be used as applied to the Deity (compare Abiel, Abijah, and Abimelech, signifying in each case the fatherhood of God), and in this way Abinadab would correspond to Jehonadab and Abiezer to Eliezer. The same applies to the elements \"aḥ-\" (\"brother\") and \"amm-\" (\"uncle\"). As, however, some of these words are applied to families, not individuals, the whole must be taken as a sentence: Avihud means \"my father is glorious\" (referring to God). On the same principle it must be assumed that some verbal names are theophorous, and refer to the action of the Deity, Nathan being the abbreviation of Elnathan (\"God gives\"), Shaphat of Jehoshaphat (\"God judges\"). Thus Ahaz appears in a form corresponding to Jehoahaz in an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III. Many of the theophorous endings are contracted into \"-a\", \"-i\", or \"-ai\", as in Shebna, Hosa, Talti, and Shemai. A few names are adjectival, and may contain references to the Deity: Baruch (\"blessed\"), David (\"beloved\"), Amos (\"strong\"). Some names have grammatical endings which it is difficult to interpret, as \"-oth\" in Shelomoth; the final \"-i\" in Omri and Barzilai probably refers to a tribal origin. Many names ending in \"-on\" are animal-names, as Ephron (\"small deer\"), Nahshon (\"small serpent\"); compare Samson (\"small sun\").\n\nAfter the Exile to Babylon there appeared a tendency toward the use of foreign names, the literal significance of which was disregarded, and this tendency became more and more prominent as time went on. Biblical names ending in \"-a\" (as in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah) are Aramaic. Shamsherai (I Chronicles 8:26), while Mordecai is probably derived from Marduk, or may be derived from \"pure myrrh\"), as are Belteshazzar (Daniel 10:1), Shenazar (I Chronicles 3:18), and Sheshbazzar (Ezra 1:8) from other deities. There is in this period a tendency also toward descriptive and adjectival names with the definite article prefixed, which easily gave rise to such surnames as Hakkaz, Hakkatan, and Hallosheth (Ezra 2:61; 8:12; Nehemiah 3:12; compare the form \"ha-Kohelet\" (Ecclesiastes 12:8, in the Hebrew). In the Hellenistic period Greek names became quite usual among the Jews, especially those of Alexander, Jason, and Antigonus. Even the name of a god like Apollo occurs (Acts 18:24). Other names are Apollonius, Hyrcanus, Lysimachus, Demetrius, Dosa, Nicanor, Pappus, Patroclus, Philo, Sosa, Symmachus, Tryphon, Zeno. The same occurs among women, as Alexandra and Priscilla. Roman names also occur, as Antonius, Apella, Drusus, Justinus, Justus, Marcus, Rufus, Tiberius, and Titus. It was during this period that the practice arose of giving a son the name of his grandfather, as was done in the high-priestly family, the members of which were named alternately Onias and Simon from 332 to 165 BCE. Similarly, a little later, in the family of the Hillelites, the names Gamaliel and Judah succeed each other with only an occasional occurrence of Simon and Hillel. Toward the end of the period, owing to the intermixture of foreign languages, the use of double names for the same person began to be adopted, as in the instances of Simon Peter, John Mark, Thomas Didymus, Herodes Agrippa, and Salome Alexandra.\n\nAmong the names in the Talmud there is a considerable proportion of Greek ones. A large number also are Aramaic, ending in \"-a\" or \"-ai\": Abba, Huna, and Papa are instances of the former. Even Bible names were transformed in this direction——Ḥanina instead of Hananiah, Abuya instead of Abijah; while others were shortened, as Lazar (for Eleazar). Many Biblical names received renewed popularity owing to the distinction of their bearers, as those of Gamaliel, Hillel, and Ulla. The tendency toward double names existed here, as Sarah Miriam, Johanan Joseph, and Mahaliel Judah. Converts to Judaism, like Aquila, Monabaz, and Helena, retained their pagan names (as was the custom also in the early Christian Church). There was some objection to foreign names among the Jews of this period, yet legend declares that the high priest Simon promised Alexander the Great that all the children of priestly families born in the year following his visit to Jerusalem would be named Alexander, after him.\n\nIn the adoption of double names during this early period an attempt was made to translate the Hebrew terms into corresponding Greek, as \"Ariston\" for \"Tobi\", \"Boethus\" for \"Ezra\", \"Justus\" for \"Zadok\", \"Philo\" for \"Jedidah\", \"Theodorus\" for \"Nethaneel\", and \"Zosimus\" for \"Ḥayyim\".\n\nIt was somewhat rare for the same name to be used by both sexes. In Biblical times this occurs with regard to the names \"Abigail\", \"Abijah\", \"Athaliah\", \"Chushan\", \"Ephah\", \"Micha\", \"Nahash\", \"Shelomith\", \"Zibiah\"; in Talmudic times, with regard to \"Ibu\", \"Johanan\", \"Nehorai\", \"Pasi\", \"Shalom\"; the only later instances that may be cited are \"Jeroham\", \"Mazal-Ṭob\", \"Neḥamah\", \"Menuḥah\", \"Simḥah\", \"Tamar\", \"Bongodas\", and \"Bien-li-Viengue\". To wear a man's name seemed as objectionable as wearing men's clothes.\n\nIt was already noticed in Talmudic times that the use of family names had died out. The name of Rabbi Meïr was said to be derived from an experience at school which was regarded as being of good omen. It is recommended not to name a child after enemies of the Jews, like Sisera and Pharaoh, but to use the names of the Patriarchs (i.e. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob).\n\nAs the Jews spread throughout the lands bordering the Mediterranean, they drew upon other languages for their personal names while still retaining Biblical ones, and they were especially prone to adopt names ending in \"-el\". These new names became exceptionally popular in Italy. To this source must be traced the new name \"Ḥushiel\", composed on the same plan as the Biblical ones ending in \"-el\". The kings of the Khazars, so far as their names are known, wavered between pure Biblical names, like Obadiah, and local names, like \"Bulan\". The Karaites in the same neighborhood adopted Tatar names, one of them being known as Toktamish; but elsewhere Karaite names are mostly Arabic and Persian.\n\nThe custom of calling one of the sons, generally the eldest, after the paternal (sometimes the maternal) grandfather, of which only nine instances are known during the Talmudic period, became more popular, especially in European states. Maimonides' grandfather was \"Joseph ben Isaac ben Joseph ben Obadiah ben Solomon ben Obadiah\", for instance, and certain families seem to have similarly confined themselves to a few chosen names. Thus, in the Kalonymus family there occurs \"Meshullam b. Moses b. Ithiel b. Moses b. Kalonymus b. Meshullam b. Kalonymus b. Moses b. Kalonymus b. Jekuthiel b. Moses b. Meshullam b. Ithiel b. Meshullam\"—only five names among fourteen persons throughout three centuries. As a consequence certain names became characteristic of certain districts: \"Japheth\" and \"Caleb\" in Greece, and hence among the Karaites; \"Kalonymus\" in south Italy; \"Sheshet\" and \"Joab\" in Rome; \"Sinai\" and \"Pesaḥ\" in Germany. Some of the older names were revived—\"Meïr\", for example, of which only two previous instances before, had been known, the tanna Meïr and the Meïr mentioned by Josephus. \"Samson\" was never used by Jews before the 11th century.\n\nThe most striking tendency of the post-Talmudic period is the general choice of local names by the Jews for their civic relations. This led to the adoption of two names, one for civic purposes, known as the \"kinnuy\" (probably from the Arabic \"kunyah\"), the other (\"shem ha-ḳodesh\") for use in the synagogue and in all Hebrew documents. The latter, the \"sacred\" name, was as far as possible associated with the former, and was often a translation of a civic one, e.g., \"Asael\" for \"Diofatto\", \"Manoah\" for \"Tranquillo\", \"Ḥayyim\" for \"Vita\"; at times the civic name was merely a contraction of the sacred one, e.g., \"Leser\" for \"Eliezer\", \"Sender\" for \"Alexander\". In other cases mere similarity in sound was sufficient to determine the sacred name, as \"Mann\" for \"Menahem\", \"Kalman\" for \"Kalonymus\", and the like. Especially noteworthy was the use made of Jacob's blessing to transfer a personal name from the civic to the sacred sphere. Judah being compared to a lion's whelp in Jacob's blessing, \"Judah\" became \"Leo\", or \"Löwe\", in lay relationship, and \"Ephraim\" became \"Fischlin\". Later on these name-equations became so usual that they formed doublets, which were almost invariably found together, as \"Dov Bär\", \"Naphtali Hirsch\", \"Solomon Zalman\", \"Judah\" or \"Aryeh Löb\", \"Binyamin Wolf\", and these again gave currency to similar correlative names, as \"Uri Phoebus\".\n\nIt was during the Middle Ages that the somewhat curious custom arose of combining the abbreviation of a title with the initials of a name to form a single personal name. This almost invariably implies frequency of mention, and, therefore, celebrity. The best-known examples are those of RaSHI and RaMBaM, who are hardly ever quoted in rabbinical texts except by these names; but there exists a large number of similar contractions.\n\nA somewhat similar use of a title is the combination with \"Messer\", as in the Italian \"Messer Leon\", while in Provence the honorary prefixes \"en-\", for men, and \"na-\", for women, are combined with the name to form \"Engusek\" (En-Joseph), \"Nabona\", etc.\n\nApart from these tendencies, the general trend of nomenclature among Jews in the Middle Ages was to adopt that of the countries in which they lived, the given names being often identical with those of the surrounding peoples, and other means of identification being derived mainly from localities or offices. Certain peculiarities of various countries may be taken separately.\n\nAmong the Mizrahim (Arabic-speaking Jews living in the Middle-East) it was quite common to replace their Hebrew names with relevant Arabic ones, whenever they bore a religious note and were deemed sacred to both Jews and Muslims, so Abraham turned into Ibrahim, Aharon into Haroun, David into Daoud, Moshe into Moussa, and Shlomo into Soliman and Salman.\n\nThe indication of a family's elevated religious status, which also gained its members the reverence of their non-Jewish neighbors, was expressed in Arabic through their name. One has to note that such names were often given by the surrounding non-Jewish communities, who confused the appropriate religious terms of the Halakhah. An example of this is the name Nader, which is the Arabic translation of Nazir: the Hebrew root word neizer (pronounced nay-zeer) means delineation or designation, and refers to the status of nezirut in which a person makes a vow to isolate himself from certain matters, such as intoxicating beverages, and other material luxuries (the absence of which would deaden his cravings for physical pleasures, as well as enhance his spiritual sensitivity and further his quest to attain spiritual heightenings), as well as things that are considered being tamea (spiritually unclean, such as corpses). Yet in the Arabic environment a family of Cohanim (descendents of Aaron and priests of the Beit haMiqdash), would often be described as such through the name Nazir, or Nader. The obvious reason behind the wrong usage of the term Nazir and its attribution to Cohanim, is the fact that the Mizrahi Cohanim had always strictly adhered to the relevant Halachic Laws which entail that they avoid coming into contact with corpses, lest they lose their status of purity, and which is similar to the rules that govern the status of nazarites, as well as their perception amongst their surrounding Arab neighbors, especially the Coptic Christians, as being consecrated (vowed) to the religious service of the Beit haMiqdash.\n\nPersonal peculiarities also gave rise to a Jew's name in the Arab world, as Abyad referred to fair skin, Afia possessor of strength, health or well being, Tawil to a tall person.\n\nIt was also quite usual that Hebrew names were translated into their corresponding meaning in the Arabic language, such as Adin into Latif, or Loutfi, Eleazar into Mansour, Gershom into Ghareeb, Mazliach into Maimun, Sameah into Said, and Tovia into Hassan, or Hassoun.\n\nCommon segments of Mizrahi society adopted local Arabic names, such as Abdallah, Abdela, Abdo and Aboudi (all meaning servant of the Lord), Farag (relief), Massoud (fortunate), Mourad (aspired to), Nessim (fresh breeze), Sabah (morning), Sahl (ease), Salama, Salem and Selim (all meaning unharmed), Zaki (well-smelling), because of their beautiful meanings, or the good fortune they seemed to evoke.\n\nAs had been the case within the Ashkenazi (Central and East European Jewish) cultural environment, Mizrahim bore names that related to their trades and occupations, such as Albaz (also Elbaz, Elvas meaning falconer), Aboutboul (Abitbol, Botbol all meaning drummer, drum maker, or seller), Hayek and Khayat (which both mean tailor), Hakim (physician, or sage), Naggar (carpenter), Sabbagh (dyer of cloth), Sabban (soap maker), Sannoua (labourer), Sarrouf or \"assaraf\" (money changer), Shenhav (also Chenhav, Shenhavy, Chenhavy) all referring to ivory and mean ivory craftsman or trader. Yemenite Jewish names were often adopted by place names such as Tzanani (from Sana'a), Taeizi (from Taiz), Harazi (from Jabal Haraz), and Damari (from Dhamar). Other family names indicate pre-Islamic Jewish origin such as Kahalani (Kahlan) and Chorath (Bnei Chorath). Additionally, some Yemenite Jewish was related to their occupation such as Tabib/Taviv (doctor) and Qafih (poet).\n\nMizrahim sought to avert the ein ha raa (evil eye) and envy by never calling the dearest of their children (especially, the firstborn son) by the real name. In their quest to protect a child, parents would even revert to such drastic measures as giving it a very unattractive nickname, such as Garboua (the one who is clad in rags), which has later become a family name.\n\nContrary to Ashkenazim, the Mizrahim applied the rulings of Talmud Shabbat 134, which provides that a child be called after a living relative. This led to the creation of another Mizrahi particularity, where a child could be named Sarah bat Sarah, or Abraham ben Abraham, which as per Ashkenazi customs, would only have been applied to a ger (gerim being convertites to Judaism, and thus, deemed having become bnai brith, that is to say children of the Covenant, holding the status of children of the Patriarch Abraham and the Matriarch Sarah).\n\nName giving also served as a social welfare tool, whereby poor parents sought to secure the support of a benefactor for their child, by naming him after a wealthy relative or employer, who would show his acceptance to look after the welfare of the child by presenting it with a first set of clothing, and later on support him with marriage expenses and the like.\n\nThe Mizrahim also reverted to this measure, as a means to strengthening the family ties between a married woman and her blood relatives, whereby a newly born child would be named after the elder of the mother's family, or one of its notables, and thus, retain his material benevolence, as well as underline the husband's expressed will to align himself to his spouse's family and gain their goodwill, or at least not to estrange his wife from her roots.\n\nA peculiarity of the Arabic onomatology is the kunyah, the by-name given to a father after the birth of his son, by which he is named after the latter (Abou, Abo, or Abu followed by the name of his son). It may be added here that Abu al-Walid is a kunyah or by-name for Jonah. Abu also forms family names, as in the case of Abudarham, or Aboab. Here it has to be noted, that the word Abou was sometimes used in the sense of \"owner\", especially when it was followed by an object that was of importance to the manner in which the surrounding community perceived the person in question. The most prominent example for this is Abou Hassira (owner of a straw mat), a descendant of a long line of kabbalists and pietists from Morocco (born 1807 in Morocco, died 1880 in Egypt, buried in the village of Demitiouh, near Damanhour, in the Governorate of Beheira), whose real name Yaccov Ben Massoud has almost been forgotten, as he has become identified as Rabbi Abou Hassira since his pilgrimage from his homeland to Jerusalem, during which the boat he was on sank, yet he was miraculously saved because he hung on to his straw mat (hassira), which had been his only possession. For this the Egyptian population venerated him from that day on as a holy man and miracle worker, whose life had been protected by the Lord through a frail mat.\n\nAkin to this is the use of the Arabic Ibn which is relaten to Hebraic \"ben\" like in \"benjamin\" or ben yamin, (meaning son of, also spelled Aben, Aven, Avin) to form a family name amongst Mizrahim who lived in the Eastern part of the Arab world. Among the best known of this formation are Ibn Aknin, Ibn Danan (hence Abendana), Ibn Latif, Ibn Migas, Ibn Verga. Those Jews who lived in the North Africa countries (especially Morocco) chose the use of the word O or sometimes spelled \"U\" (belonging to), which created the names Ou'Hanna, (son of Hanna, also spelled Bohana, Abuhana, Abuhenna), O'Hayon (son of Life), O'Knine (son of Yacob, also spelled Waknin, Ouaknin).\n\nThe Arabic article \"al\" appears in quite a number of names, as in \"Al-Ḥarisi\". Other names of interest, given by Steinschneider in a long list of eight hundred Arabic names in the \"Jewish Quarterly Review\" (ix. -xiii.), are \"Ghayyat\" (in Spanish \"Gayet\"), \"Ibn Danan\" and \"Ibn al-Dayyal\", \"Al-Haruni\" (\"the Aaronide\", the same as \"Cohen\"), \"Ibn Waḳar\", \"Ibn Zabara\" and \"Ibn Zimra\", \"Ḥaji\" (applied to Karaites who had performed the pilgrimage to Jerusalem), \"Yaḥya\" (equivalent to \"John\" or \"Judah\"). \"Morel\" is said to be derived from \"Samuel\"; \"Molko\" means \"royal\"; \"Mas'ud\" is equivalent to \"Baruch\"; \"Muḳattil\" (\"champion\") would be a proper origin for the family name \"Mocatta\"; \"Najar\" and \"Najara\" refer to carpentry; \"Sasun\" is merely a transcript of \"Sason\" (\"lily\"). The proper names \"Sa‘id\", \"Saad\", and \"Sa'dan\" are equally popular among Jews and Arabs. \"Abbas\" (\"lion\") corresponds to \"Judah\", as \"Leo\" and the like in Europe.\n\nVery many Judeo-Arabic names are compounded of\" 'abd\" (\"servant\"), as \"Abdallah\" and \"'Abd al-Walid\". \"Al-Faraj\" occurs as the name of the translator at \"Girgenti\", and it is possibly the remote origin of the curious name of Admiral Farragut, whose grandfather came from Menorca. It is considered doubtful whether the name of the \"Ḳimḥis\" is Hebrew in that form, or whether it should be pronounced as an Arabic word, \"Ḳamḥi\" (\"formed of wheat\").\n\nJews have historically used Hebrew patronymic names. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either ben- or bat- (\"son of\" and \"daughter of\", respectively), and then the father's name. (Bar-, \"son of\" in Aramaic, is also seen). Permanent family surnames exist today but only gained popularity among Sephardic Jews in Iberia as early as the 10th or 11th century and did not spread widely to the Ashkenazic Jews of Germany or Eastern Europe until the late 18th and mid 19th century, when laws were passed mandating they adopt surnames. Thus, while many European and North American Jews now use European and German surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in Jewish religious and cultural life, and is common in Israel. It is used in synagogue and in documents in Jewish law such as the ketubah (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic ibn instead of bat or ben when it was the norm. The Spanish family Ibn Ezra is one example.\n\nMany immigrants to modern Israel change their names to Hebrew names, to erase remnants of Diaspora life still surviving in family names from other languages. This is especially common among Ashkenazic Jews, because most of their European names do not go back far in history; surnames were imposed by the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires in the 18th century (explaining why many Ashkenazi Jews have German or European-sounding names). The newly-assumed Hebrew names were sometimes based on phonetic similarity with their former (European) surname: Golda Meyersohn became Golda Meir.\n\nA popular form to create a new family names is the false patronymic, using the prefix \"ben\" or \"bar\" followed by words who are not the name of a parent. Examples include patriotic themes, such as ben Ami (\"son of my people\"), or ben Artzi (\"son of my country\"), and terms related to the Israeli landscape, such as bar Ilan (\"son of the trees\", also similar phonetically to the bearer's original family name Berlin). Another famous person who used a false patronymic is the first Israeli Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. His former family name was Grün, and he adopted the name \"Ben-Gurion\" (\"son of Gurion\"), not \"Ben-Avigdor\" (his father's name). Gurion was a Jewish leader in the period of the First Jewish–Roman War.\n\nChange of name was not an unusual occurrence in Biblical times, if one may judge by the instances occurring among the Patriarchs, and it seems to have been not altogether unknown in later times. Thus, Moses Benveniste mentions a certain Obadiah who wandered from Germany to Turkey in 1654 and changed his name to Moses because the former name was unusual. Later in the Middle Ages a person who was dangerously sick would change his name in the hope that the Angel of Death, who summons persons by name, would be baffled thereby. This custom, known as \"meshanneh shem,\" is given in the Talmud and is mentioned by Judah Ḥasid. One of the names thus adopted was the appropriate one of \"Ḥayyim\". In order to prevent any misunderstanding at the resurrection the cabalists later recommended persons to learn a psalm the first and last verses of which began and ended with the first and last letters of their names. Particular care is to be taken in the writing of names in legal documents, the slightest error in which invalidates them. Hence there are quite a number of monographs on names, both personal and geographical, the first of which was that written by Simḥah Cohen; the best known is that of Samuel ben Phoebus and Ephraim Zalman Margulies entitled \"Ṭib Giṭṭin.\"\n\nIt was thought that Jews of the same name should not live in the same town or permit their children to marry into each other's families; this seems to have some reference to exogamy. It is even urged that one should not marry a woman of the same name as one's mother; or that she should be required to change it. Even to the present day it is considered unlucky in Russia for a father-in-law to have the same name as the bridegroom. In other parts of Russia it is considered bad luck to name a child after a living relative. When several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as \"Alter\" (, literally \"old\"), or \"Alterke\", the view being that the Angel of Death, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it. For a somewhat similar reason it is considered unlucky in Lithuania to call an only child by its true name.\n\nIt was customary for well-known authors of medieval times to be known by the titles of their works rather than by their own names. Thus, Jacob ben Asher is referred to as the \"Ṭur\" or the \"Ba'al ha-Ṭurim\"; Joseph Caro is known as the \"Bet Yosef\"; and Ezekiel Landau as \"Noda' bi-Yehudah\"; while even more frequently were authors known by contracted forms of their names, with the addition of some honorary prefix, as given above. Among contemporary Hebrew writers this practice is still more widely observed, though no honorary title is prefixed. A list is given by Moïse Schwab in his \"Repertoire\". Most Yiddish writers appear to prefer to write under some pen-name or pseudonym, and their example is at times followed by modern writers of Hebrew, though these, as a rule, prefer to give a name composed of their initials.\nOf course, other Jewish writers besides the above have adopted pen-names. I. Zangwill has written under the names \"J. Freeman Bell\" (in collaboration), \"Countess von S.\", and \"Marshallik\"; Mrs. Frankau is known as \"Frank Danby\"; and so on; but there is nothing specifically Jewish about this adoption of a pen-name.\n\n\n\n"}

As a student at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s, she became active in organizations working for civil liberties and the civil rights movement. She went on to do voter registration and community organization in Alabama and Mississippi and was an early organizer of the women's liberation movement. She authored several classic feminist articles as well as important papers on social movements and political parties. She has also written extensively about women, particularly on law and public policy toward women and women in mainstream politics.\n\nShe was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1945. Her mother Helen was from Hamilton, Alabama, and had served during World War II as a first lieutenant in the Women's Army Corps, stationed in England. Soon after Jo's birth she moved to Los Angeles, California where she taught junior high school until shortly before her death from emphysema. Freeman attended Birmingham High School, but graduated in the first class of Granada Hills High School in 1961. She received her BA with honors in political science from UC Berkeley in 1965. She began her graduate work in political science at the University of Chicago in 1968 and completed her PhD in 1973. After four years of teaching at the State University of New York she went to Washington, DC as a Brookings Fellow and stayed another year as an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow. She entered New York University School of Law in 1979 as a Root-Tilden Scholar and received her JD degree in 1982. She was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1983.\n\nAt Berkeley Freeman was active in the University Young Democrats and the campus political party, SLATE. SLATE worked to abolish nuclear testing, to eliminate the University's ban on controversial speakers, and to improve undergraduate education at Cal. It developed a guide to classes and professors entitled the \"SLATE Supplement to the General Catalog,\" for which Freeman wrote reviews of professors and their courses. One of SLATE's fundamental principles was that students should have the same rights to take stands on issues on campus that they had as citizens off campus. The University had restricted such activity since the 1930s. It became a major issue when the civil rights movement came to the Bay Area in the fall of 1963 because students wanted to support the movement on campus as well as off.\n\nIn the fall of 1964 the question was dramatized when student organizations set up tables on campus to solicit money and recruit students for off-campus political action in defiance of the ban. One person was arrested and several students were issued administrative citations. After a mass arrest was narrowly avoided by last minute negotiations with University president Clark Kerr, the Free Speech Movement (FSM) was formed by the student groups to continue the struggle. Freeman represented the University Young Democrats on the FSM executive committee. After two months of fruitless negotiations, Freeman was one of \"the 800\" students who were arrested for sitting in at the main administration building on December 2–3, 1964. This was the biggest mass arrest in California history. The publicity it generated compelled the Regents of the University to change the rules so that students could pursue political issues on campus.\n\nWhen the civil rights movement came to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1963, it picketed local employers who didn't hire blacks. Demonstrations were organized at Lucky supermarket and Mel's Drive-In to get them to sign hiring agreements. Success here was followed by unsuccessful negotiations with San Francisco's most elegant hotels and several automobile dealers. Freeman was one of 167 demonstrators arrested at the Sheraton-Palace Hotel in March 1964, and one of 226 arrested at the Cadillac agency in April. She was acquitted in her first trial and convicted in her second, resulting in a fifteen-day jail sentence. Her second trial kept her from attending the 1964 Freedom Summer project in Mississippi. After it ended she hitchhiked to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in August in Atlantic City, New Jersey to support the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party's petition to be seated in place of the all-white regular Mississippi delegation.\n\nFollowing graduation from UC Berkeley, Freeman joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's (SCLC) summer project, SCOPE (Southern Community Organization and Political Education). When the summer was over, she joined the SCLC staff as a field worker. For the next year she did voter registration in Alabama and Mississippi, spending a few days in jail in both states. In August 1966, when she was working in Grenada, Mississippi, the \"Jackson Daily News\" published an exposé of her work as a \"professional agitator\" on its editorial page, implying that she was a communist sympathizer. Accompanied by five photographs, including one taken at Cal during the FSM, this made her a potential target for Mississippi death squads. Thirty years later a federal court order disclosed that these were provided to the newspaper by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission. An informant had documented Freeman's participation in the FSM and recognized her in Grenada. Concerned for her safety, SCLC sent Freeman back to Atlanta, where she worked in the main office and also as Coretta Scott King's assistant for six weeks. In October she was sent to work with SCLC's Chicago project. As the SCLC 's Chicago project faded out, Freeman went to work for a community newspaper, the \"West Side TORCH\". When this job ended she tried to find jobs as a journalist and photographer in Chicago, where she was told that girls can't cover riots. Eventually she found work as a re-write editor for a trade magazine, later becoming a freelance writer.\n\nIn June 1967 Freeman attended a \"free school\" course on women at the University of Chicago led by Heather Booth and Naomi Weisstein. She invited them to organize a woman's workshop at the then-forthcoming National Conference of New Politics (NCNP), to be held over Labor Day weekend 1967 in Chicago. At that conference a woman's caucus was formed, and it (led by Freeman and Shulamith Firestone) tried to present its own demands to the plenary session. However, the women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion, and when through threatening to tie up the convention with procedural motions they succeeded in having their statement tacked to the end of the agenda, it was never discussed. When the National Conference for New Politics Director William F. Pepper refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about the American Indian, five women, including Firestone, rushed the podium to demand to know why. But William F. Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, \"Move on little girl; we have more important issues to talk about here than women's liberation,\" or possibly, \"Cool down, little girl. We have more important things to talk about than women's problems.\" Freeman and Firestone called a meeting of the women who had been at the \"free school\" course and the women's workshop at the conference; this became the first Chicago women's liberation group. It was known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman's apartment on Chicago's west side. After a few months Freeman started a newsletter which she called \"Voice of the women's liberation movement.\" It circulated all over the country (and in a few foreign countries), giving the new movement its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations, including the Chicago Women's Liberation Union.\n\nIn the fall of 1968 Freeman enrolled in graduate school in political science at the University of Chicago. However, she took courses outside the discipline which would give her an opportunity to explore the research on women, sex roles and related topics. Most of the term papers she wrote were later published in various magazines and in college textbooks. When consciousness about women at the University was raised by a sit-in prompted by the firing of a popular female professor, Freeman led efforts to examine women's experiences at the University and in academia. These included teaching a \"free course\" on the legal and economic position of women early in 1969, chairing the student subcommittee of the new Committee on University Women, and organizing a major campus conference on women the following fall.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association (APSA) in 1969, she helped to found the Women's Caucus for Political Science, eventually serving as its treasurer for one year. She also served on APSA's Committee on the Status of Women.\n\nAs a result of her publications, Freeman was invited to speak at many other colleges and universities, mostly in the Midwest. She spent the summers of 1970 and 1971 hitchhiking through Europe distributing feminist literature. Her lecture at the University of Oslo in 1970 is credited for sparking its first new feminist group. The literature she distributed was also a boon to feminists in the Netherlands.\n\nAlthough Freeman had not been active in Democratic Party politics since leaving California in 1965 (except for a brief stint on Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential campaign), she ran for delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention in order to put Shirley Chisholm's name on the ballot. She came in ninth out of 24 candidates in Chicago's first district and attended the convention as an alternate with the Chicago Challenge Delegation that unseated Mayor Daley's hand-picked slate. She later worked on California Senator Alan Cranston's 1984 Presidential campaign and became active in Democratic Party politics in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nFreeman wrote four classic feminist papers under her movement name \"Joreen\", which analyzed her experiences in the women's liberation movement. The most widely known is \"The Tyranny of Structurelessness,\" which argued there is no such thing as a structureless group; power is simply disguised and hidden when structure is unacknowledged. All groups and organizations need clear lines of responsibility for democratic accountability, a notion that underlies the theory of democratic structuring. Her 1969 \"BITCH Manifesto\" is considered an early example of language reclamation by a social movement, as well as a celebration of non-traditional gender roles. A third article, \"Trashing: The Dark Side of Sisterhood,\" illuminated an aspect of the women's movement that many participants experienced but few wanted to discuss openly. \"The 51 Percent Minority Group: A Statistical Essay\" appeared in the 1970 anthology \"\", edited by Robin Morgan.\n\nFreeman's 1973 dissertation analyzed the two branches of the women's movement, arguing that they were separated more by generation and experience than by ideology. What she called the \"younger branch\" was started by women with experience in civil rights, anti-war, and New Left student activism. The \"older branch\" was founded by women who had been members of or worked with the President's Commission on the Status of Women and related state Commissions. The latter branch gave rise to such organizations as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL). The resulting book, \"The Politics of Women's Liberation\", was published in 1975 and won the APSA's prize for the best scholarly work on women in politics. Freeman wrote The Bitch Manfesto in fall of 1968.In this work, Freeman notes that women are labeled as a bitch in society based on three principles, their personality, orientation, and physicality. Freeman argues that women that are labeled \"a bitch\" are often seen as aggressive or as a man hater. Jo Freeman asked women to embrace their inner bitch, noting that it is difficult to make societal change without angering people (and therefore receiving the bitch label). The Bitch Manifesto was disliked by many but, this made an impact on Feminism. \n\nIn 1977 Freeman became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP).\n\nFreeman is featured in the feminist history film \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\".\n\nBefore receiving her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1973, Freeman taught for four years at the State University of New York. She then spent two years in Washington, DC as a fellow at the Brookings Institution and then as an APSA Congressional Fellow. With an increasing interest in public policy, and unable to find a full-time appointment in academia, Freeman decided to study law after she was offered a Root-Tilden Scholarship at New York University School of Law. She received a J.D. degree in 1982 and was admitted to the New York State Bar the next year. She maintained a private practice in Brooklyn, New York for many years, serving as counsel to women running for political offices and to pro-choice demonstrators.\n\nFreeman has published 11 books and hundreds of articles. Most are on some aspect of women or feminism, but she also writes about social movements and political parties. Two of these are considered classics: \"On the Origins of Social Movements\" and \"The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties.\" \"Women: A Feminist Perspective\" went into five editions and for many years was the leading introductory women's studies textbook. \"A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics\" (2000) also won a prize for scholarship given at the APSA.\n\nShe has continued to attend the major party political conventions, but as a journalist. Many of her articles are posted to her webpage, as are some of her photographs of political events and a small selection from her button collection.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1786233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1786233", "title": "Kenelm Henry Digby", "text": "Kenelm Henry Digby\n\nKenelm Henry Digby (c. 1797 – 1880) was an Anglo-Irish writer, whose reputation rests chiefly on his earliest publication, \"The Broad-Stone of Honour, or Rules for the Gentlemen of England\" (1822), which contains an exhaustive survey of medieval customs. The work was subsequently enlarged and issued (1828–29) in four volumes entitled: \"Godefridus, Tancredus, Morus \"and\" Orlandus\". Digby's exposure to Walter Scott's \"Ivanhoe\" novels as a youth encouraged him to romanticize the Middle Ages. \"Broad-Stone\" contributed to the Young England movement’s feudalist ideology and influenced many of Digby's Cambridge contemporaries. The book inculcated readers with ideas of chivalry and staunch Catholicism and stressed the importance of the heart’s knowledge over intellectual learning by presenting historical figures as role models. Digby's revival of medieval principles helped young men of his day construct their idea of what being a \"gentleman\" means.\n\nBorn at Clonfert, he was 15 when his father died in 1812. He moved to England to attend Petersham High School near London. From 1816 to 1819, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where some members of the university advocated reform and even republicanism; Digby, however, favoured a strong monarchy, the Church, and chivalry. At Cambridge, he read Tennyson and Hallam; his close friends there were George Darby, Julius Hare, William Whewell, and Adam Sedgwick. In summer, he traveled across Europe sketching old castles and writing. \n\nEhrenbreitstein, a massive mediaeval fortress in Germany, gave him the title \"The Broad-Stone of Honour\". He published the book in a single volume in 1822, and the beliefs he explored while writing it seem to have contributed to his conversion to Catholicism in 1825. After that, he rewrote and expanded the one volume into four, published in 1828-29: \"Godfridus\", containing a general introduction (named after Godfrey of Boulogne, a Crusade hero); \"Tancredus\", discussing chivalry’s discipline and applauding Christianity (for Tancred of Hauteville, another Crusade hero); \"Morus\", bashing the Reformation as the death of chivalry and religion (after Sir Thomas More); and \"Orlandus\", which detailed Digby’s idea of chivalric behaviour (after Ariosto’s \"Orlando Furioso\"). \n\n \n"}
{"id": "1591307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1591307", "title": "Lash LaRue", "text": "Lash LaRue\n\nAlfred \"Lash\" LaRue (June 15, 1917 – May 21, 1996) was a popular western motion picture star of the 1940s and 1950s. He had exceptional skill with the bullwhip and taught Harrison Ford how to use a bullwhip for the Indiana Jones movies. LaRue was one of the first recipients of the Golden Boot Awards in 1983.\n\nBorn Alfred LaRue in Gretna, Louisiana in 1917, he was reared in various towns throughout Louisiana, but in his teens the family moved to Los Angeles, California, where he attended St. John's Military Academy. However, California death records show his father's last name as Wilson and that he was born in Michigan. He also attended the College of the Pacific.\n\nHe began acting in films in 1944 (at age 27) as Al LaRue, appearing in two musicals and a serial before being given a role in a Western film that would result in his being cast in a cowboy persona for virtually the rest of his career. He was given the name Lash because of the -long bullwhip he used to help bring down the bad guys. The popularity of his first role as the Cheyenne Kid, a sidekick of singing cowboy hero Eddie Dean, not just brandishing a whip but using it expertly to disarm villains, paved the way for LaRue to be featured in his own series of Western films. After appearing in all three of the Eddie Dean Cinecolor singing Westerns in 1945-46, he starred in quirky B-westerns from 1947 to 1951, at first for Poverty Row studio PRC, then for Eagle-Lion when they took over the studio, and later for producer Ron Ormond.\n\nHe developed his image as the cowboy hero Lash LaRue, dressed all in black, and inherited from Buster Crabbe a comic sidekick in the form of \"Fuzzy Q. Jones\" played by Al St. John. LaRue played the Cheyenne Kid sidekick in about 8 films, before he starred in his own film series, playing a character actually named \"Marshall Lash LaRue\". Those 11 films (from 1948-1951) are the ones that western movie fans refer to as the \"Lash LaRue\" film series (see Filmography below).\n\nHe was different from the usual cowboy hero of the era: dressed in black, he spoke with a \"city tough-guy\" accent somewhat like that of Humphrey Bogart, whom he physically resembled. His use of a bullwhip, however, was what set him apart from bigger cowboy stars such as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. His influence was felt throughout the dying medium of B-westerns; for example, he had an imitator, Whip Wilson, who starred in his own brief series, and even Roy Rogers started picking up and using a bullwhip in some of his Republic Studios Westerns made in the same period.\n\nHe also made frequent personal appearances at small-town movie theaters that were showing his films during his heyday of 1948-51, a common practice for cowboy stars in those days. However, his skillful displays of stunts with his whip, done live on movie theater stages, also convinced young Western fans that there was at least one cowboy hero who could do in real life the same things he did on screen. He continued working in films and television until he retired in 1990.\n\nThis is a chronological list of the eleven films in which he actually played the character named \"Marshal Lash LaRue\". They are all available on a single box set of DVDs (along with a bonus film called \"The Son of Billy The Kid\").\n\n\"Lash LaRue Western\" comic books were published first by Fawcett Comics and later by Charlton Comics between 1949 and 1961. They were among the most popular Western-themed comics of the era, running for more than 100 (usually monthly) issues.\n\nFor a time he was married to Reno Browne, a B-western actress, who together with Dale Evans was one of only two Western actresses ever to have their own comic book fashioned after her character. He later married Barbara Fuller, a radio, film and television actress. Their marriage lasted slightly over a year; they wed February 23, 1951 in Yuma, Arizona, and divorced June 2, 1952.\n\nLash LaRue comic books sold over one million copies each around the world, many of which featured Lash and Barbara's godson, J.P. Sloane.\n\nIn the later 1950s, LaRue was featured in archival footage numerous times on the children's program \"The Gabby Hayes Show\". He appeared several times on the syndicated television series \"26 Men\", true stories of the Arizona Rangers. LaRue also appeared on Jimmie Jackson's television show \"Memory Lane\" He appeared seven times in different roles in the 1956 TV western \"Judge Roy Bean\", starring Edgar Buchanan in the title role, with Jack Buetel and Jackie Loughery. One of his roles on \"Judge Roy Bean\" was as the outlaw John Wesley Hardin. He portrayed another real-life criminal, Doc Barker, in the TV series \"Gangbusters\", which was later recut into the film \"Guns Don't Argue\".\n\nLaRue and Steve Brodie shared the role (from 1959–61) of Sheriff Johnny Behan in Cochise County, Arizona, on ABC's \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", starring Hugh O'Brian. LaRue appeared five times; Brodie, nine times.\n\nA role as the villain in a pornographic western, \"Hard on the Trail\", in 1972, led him to repentance as a missionary for ten years, as he had not been informed of the adult nature of the film and would not have consented to appear in the film. He did not actually appear in any of the pornographic scenes. The film was later released without the pornographic scenes and re-titled \"Hard Trail\" in an attempt to eliminate the double entendre.\n\nLaRue often returned to Louisiana and East Texas, where he grew up. He became a regular at the jam sessions at the Dew Drop Inn in New Orleans and clubs in the Dallas area under the name Lucky LaRue. In his autobiography, \"Backbeat\", drummer Earl Palmer recalls:\n\nLots of white people wanted to come to the Dew Drop. Most were turned away, but they let a few in. Every time the cowboy actor Lash LaRue came in town, he came by. He played a hell of a guitar and was a regular guy that people liked.\n\nHe was a born-again Christian who was baptized at Shreveport Baptist Tabernacle by pastor Jimmy G. Tharpe. Tharpe initially met LaRue in Alexandria, the seat of Rapides Parish, when LaRue was visiting the home of his daughter. He and another minister, Don Chelette of Alexandria, were proselytizing door-to-door when they met LaRue and his daughter.\n\nTharpe thereafter declared a \"Lash LaRue Day\" at his church at which LaRue gave his Christian testimony: \"He came, and we had a wonderful service in our gymnasium. There were thirty-seven people saved in the gym that day. He cut paper from the mouth of Debbye, my daughter, with his whip. We all rejoiced over Lash LaRue and his testimony. I introduced Lash to others, and several churches invited him to give his testimony, and he accepted.\"\n\nLaRue later was an evangelist who worked with alcoholics in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was one of several people injured by a tornado while in attendance at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia, Missouri, on August 20, 1952.\n\nLaRue died of emphysema in 1996 (age 78) at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, and was cremated at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. He was survived by his wife, Frances Bramlett LaRue, three sons and three daughters.\n\nHis name was mentioned in the 1973 song \"Childhood - 1949\", which was written and recorded by Bobby Goldsboro as the B-side to his hit single \"Summer (The First Time)\".\n\nHe is one of many classic western stars mentioned in the 1974 Statler Brothers song \"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?\"\n\nWriter/singer/producer Bruce Blackman of the pop group Starbuck wrote and recorded the tribute song \"Lash LaRue,\" included on their 1976 album \"Moonlight Feels Right\".\n\nIn the 1994 film, \"Pulp Fiction\", Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel), refers to Vincent Vega, (John Travolta) as Lash LaRue.\n\nLaRue is seen on the 1986 Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings duet album Heroes (Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings album). LaRue holds the lash on the front cover and on the back cover of the album, LaRue is standing with Jennings and Cash.\n\nProfessional wrestler John LeRoux borrowed his ring name from LaRue, dubbing himself \"Lash LeRoux\" in 1999.\nIn the Rockford Files episode entitled, \"Material Difference\" 1978, Rockford confronts his notorious sidekick Angel Martin at an outdoor restaurant. Rockford asks the leather jacket-clad Angel, \"What are you a clone of Lash LaRue?\"\n\n\n"}

He was born in Ixtlahuaca, State of Mexico in 1859 and died in exile in Spain in 1922. He graduated from the Mexican Military Academy as an artillery officer in 1880. He designed Mexico's first semi-automatic rifle, the M1908 rifle, and a 75mm howitzer. General Mondragón was the father of a model, artist and poet Carmen Mondragón, better known as Nahui Ollin.\n\nAs an adolescent Mondragón entered the Military Academy of Chapultepec, where he specialised in artillery. Upon finishing his studies, he worked developing military materiel. He modified the French 75mm howitzer, earning a name for himself among Porfirist military circles. He perfected a repeating rifle and a 75mm howitzer (the \"Saint-Chamond-Mondragón\"), both of which still bear his name. In 1904 he wrote a manual \"Description and employment of the instruments for preparing and executing fires\", and in 1910 \"Description of rapid-fire 75mm materiel\". In 1907 he was named Director of the Department of Artillery.\n\nHe initiated a project on military organic law, based on mandatory military service, and as professor of the Military Academy released a work in 1910 entitled \"Defense of the Coasts\". The artillery at the ports of Salina Cruz on the Pacific and Puerto México on the Gulf are due to his efforts.\n\nAs a military officer during the Porfirato, he worked against the Maderista movement. In September 1911, he took leave from the Federal Army, but in 1913 returned, reincorporated in the army to support Gregorio Ruiz in the anti-Maderista rebellion of the \"Decena trágica\". He is suspected of having assassinated the Mexican President Francisco I. Madero and his Vice-President José María Pino.\n\nAt the side of Bernardo Reyes and Félix Díaz, Mondragón assisted in the start of the rebellion and coup against Francisco I. Madero. He allied with General Victoriano Huerta as Madero was obliged to renounce the presidency, thus frustrating the start of a new democratic direction in the country. Upon Huerta's assumption of the presidency, Mondragón was named Secretary of War and the Navy. He served in this position only a short time, as in June he resigned amid accusations from prominent Huertist politicians and public opinion of his culpability in the advance of revolutionary forces, due to his incompetence and poor planning in the campaign against them.\n\nFollowing these accusations, Victoriano Huerta expelled Mondragón from Mexico, heeding the rumor of a plot to overthrow him. Mondragón left for Spain, where the government of France awarded him the Légion d'honneur. General Manuel Mondragón died in San Sebastián in 1922.\n\n"}

He attended a German school in his native town, where he was trained to become a blacksmith. Often he indulged into travels (Montenegro, Serbia), and exceptionally in a few occasions to Bosnia. In 1841 he was back to Novi, practicing his craft and agriculture, but also engaging in literature and cultural issues in general. In 1847 he ended up in Vienna, in 1848 again in Bosnia (in Sarajevo, at the court of Fazli-paša Šerifija). At the end of 1848, in a latter addressed to his brothers he says: \"I don't know when I shall return home, for I have been, I'm afraid, created for this country. Turks are very fond of me for my prudence, they say, and rayah grows ever more trust in me, and therefrom there is no other outcome but mitre on the head or a stake in the arse\".

The travelogue intermixes author's views on the relationships between the Ottoman Turks and the Bosniaks, Islam and Christianity, with accounts of the customs of everyday life, images of vizier courts of agas and pashas, but also of folk meyhanes, contemplations on everyday life, love and death.\n\n"}
{"id": "58830771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58830771", "title": "Max Troll", "text": "Max Troll\n\nMax Troll (1902 – 7 April 1972) was a German communist-turned-informer who betrayed hundreds of Bavarian communists to the Bavarian Political Police, a forerunner of the Gestapo, between 1933 and 1936. Troll spent a short time in Dachau concentration camp and served in the German Army during World War II. After the war he was sentenced to ten years in jail for his role as informer and released after five, in contrast to his Gestapo handlers who were not prosecuted.\n\nTroll was never a Nazi, opposing the regime instead, but a number of factors have been cited for his betrayal, among them financial difficulties, his treatment while being held at Dachau and the threat of physical violence against his stepbrothers should he not cooperate.\n\nTroll, the son of a truck driver, and born in Lower Bavaria, grew up in Munich. Troll worked as a labourer on building sites and as a life guard for the city of Munich, but lost his job in 1931 because of his left-wing activities and thereafter remained unemployed until 1934. Troll lived in the working class suburb of Giesing, in public housing, an area dominated by unemployment and communist activities, and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1932.\n\nWith Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, the Nazis took power in Bavaria on 9 March 1933 and Troll was arrested the same day alongside his two stepbrothers and taken to Dachau concentration camp. He and his brothers were some of its first inmates. Troll was released in May and worked as an informer for the Bavarian political police, now under the control of Heinrich Himmler. The possibility exists that he either already worked as an informer when he joined the KPD in 1932, or that he may have been forced into cooperating after his release by the threat that his brothers would be killed or ill treated at Dachau should he refuse. His difficult financial situation as well as the fact that he was broken by ill treatment while at Dachau may also have been factors. In any case, from May 1933 Troll made a concentrated effort to establish the names of Bavarian communists who had gone underground. Because of the decentralized nature of the communist movements it had become very hard for the police to track the communist resistance.\n\nUnder the code name \"Theo\", Troll actively recruited members for the communist resistance. He was employed at a building site at the Deutsches Museum in Munich in 1934 and successfully recruited members there. Those as well as communists who distributed illegal leaflets and collected donations for the \"Rote Hilfe\", an organisation supporting family members of people arrested by the Nazis, were betrayed by Troll. He rose to become, in April 1935, the leader of the \"Rote Hilfe\" and, in early 1936, the leader of the KPD in Southern Bavaria. Troll travelled repeatedly to Switzerland and Czechoslovakia to obtain donations and instructions while also infiltrating the non-communist resistance in Bavaria with his informers.\n\nBecause of his work the Bavarian political police were able to wait until mid-1935 until initiating a wave of arrests, being in almost complete control of the communist resistance in Munich and able to direct it through Troll. By then, when suspicion started to fall on him, Troll had handed the names of 250 communists and sympathisers to the police as well as betrayed their organisational structure, bringing the communist resistance in Munich to an almost complete standstill. Some of the resistance members he betrayed were subsequently sentenced to death and executed. He was also involved in the destruction of the Munich cell of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany and made contact with Catholic and monarchist resistance groups as part of the aim of the KPD to create a united peoples front, the \"Volksfront\", to resist Hitler and the Nazis. \n\nTroll was withdrawn as an informer by the Gestapo in 1936 and subsequently worked in the Messerschmitt aircraft factory in Regensburg, courtesy to a glowing referral provided by Karl Brunner, the head of the Gestapo in Munich. \n\nWhile paid well during his times as police informer for his work, receiving up to 240 Reichsmark per month, Troll did not receive any further benefits once his role had been completed and the Gestapo actively tried to ensure that he would not be employed in any politically sensitive role. From 1940 to 1944 Troll served in the Wehrmacht until captured in 1944, and returned to Germany in 1946 after having been a prisoner of war in France. During his time in the German military his comrades noted that Troll was opposed to the Nazi regime and criticised it, something they testified to in his trial after the war.\n\nHe was tracked down by victims of his betrayal, who extracted a written confession from him, which led to his arrest in West Germany in May 1947. He was sentenced to ten years in a labour camp by a court in Regensburg, but released after five for health reasons. The sentence against Troll in Regensburg was one of the hardest for Nazi crimes there and also included confiscation of his assets, loss of the right to vote, and a ban from working. \n\nAttempts to prosecute him further for the death of communists he betrayed were unsuccessful as the court in Munich deemed the result of his actions as within the frame of the anti-communist laws in Germany at the time and the Cold War anti-communist attitude in the west after the war. His three former contacts in the Gestapo who he reported to were not prosecuted, although they did spend some compulsory time in detention for being members of the organisation. Some even re-entered Bavarian government service after the war.\n\nTroll died in Regensburg on 7 April 1972 without suffering any further repercussions for his actions as informer.\n\nThe destruction of the communist resistance in Munich and the role Troll played in it became part of the novel \"Verrat in München und Burghausen\" (Betrayal in Munich and Burghausen) by Max Brym, published in 2018, which tells the story a fictional protagonist in the back ground of the real events.\n\n"}
{"id": "8590200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8590200", "title": "Ned Christie", "text": "Ned Christie\n\nNed Christie (December 14, 1852 – November 3, 1892), also known as NeDe WaDe in Cherokee, was a Cherokee statesman. Ned was a member of the executive council in the Cherokee Nation senate, and served as one of three advisers to Chief Dennis Bushyhead. He was notable for holding off American lawmen in what was later called Ned Christie's War, after being accused, wrongfully according to testimony in 1918, of murdering a United States Marshal. This gave him notoriety as an outlaw, and he was eventually killed by lawmen.\n\nChristie was born at Wauhillau (located at ), Going Snake District, Cherokee Nation, in the present-day state of Oklahoma. He was the son of the Removal Era Trail of Tears survivors, Watt and Lydia (Thrower) Christie. They were of the Keetowah band, the most traditional of Cherokee peoples. \n\nAs a child and young man, Christie was a marble champion, stick ball player and a popular fiddle player.\n\nOne source says Ned was married first to Nannie Dick about 1871. Ned's second wife was said to be Peggy Tucker who he married in 1875. Third, he married Jennie Scraper (about 1877). Fourth, he married Nancy Greece (about 1888).\n\nChristie was a big man at , and became a blacksmith and gunsmith. In 1885, he was elected to the tribal Senate.\n\nBy religion Ned was a member of the Keetoowah Society. According to Hamilton, Keetowah translates into English as \"principle people\" or \"real people.\" His father, Watt, and grandfather (Lacy Christie), were Chiefs of their ceremonial ground near the family home at Wauhillau (present-day Adair County, Oklahoma).\n\nAlthough well-regarded by fellow Cherokees, Christie had a hot temper, especially after drinking whiskey. He had once been charged with manslaughter in the 1885 death of another Cherokee, William Palone. Tried in the tribal court at Talequah, he was found not guilty and released.\n\nOn May 3, 1887, U.S. Deputy Marshal Daniel Maples led a posse into Indian Territory seeking sellers of illegal whiskey. A principal culprit was Bud Trainer, who already had a record for selling whiskey and committing violent crimes. After spending the day unsuccessfully seeking Trainer, Maples and posse member George Jefferson started back to their camp near Spring Branch Creek. was shot from ambush in the Cherokee Nation by someone who escaped without being identified. Maples died of his wounds on the next day.\n\nAccording to Frates' version of the story, the other marshals suspected that Trainer was the man who shot Maples, and began arresting his associates. Christie was accused of the murder by a companion, John Parris, who was at first arrested for the crime. Parris told authorities that Christie had fired the shot that killed Maples. Friends convinced Christie to hide, but he also appealed to the United States Court of the Western District of Arkansas in Fort Smith for bail to allow time to prove his innocence. (This court also had oversight over the Indian Territory.) US Judge Isaac C. Parker did not believe he could comply with the request. Parker's sensational cases and record of executions dominate the period's history, although he also worked to rehabilitate offenders, reform the criminal justice system, and advocate the rights of the Indian nations in the territory.\n\nFearing a trial before white people in a U.S. court, Christie fortified his home to resist arrest. He learned that he had already been indicted for Maples' murder and that Judge Parker had sent more marshals to arrest him. Reportedly, he wrote a letter to Judge Parker, saying that he was willing to surrender if Parker would promise to release him on bail while he looked for evidence to prove his innocence. Parker never answered the letter, other than to send the marshals. He began a stand-off with the U.S. that would last almost five years. He was advertised as an outlaw \"wanted, dead or alive.\"\n\nIn 1889, Jacob Yoes became the U.S. Marshal in Fort Smith. Yoes assigned his top deputy, Heck Thomas, to lead the effort to bring in Christie. Thomas was assisted by Deputy Marshall L. P. Isbell of Vinita, two other marshals, plus the notorious Bud Trainer. In an attack in 1889, lawmen burned his house to the ground, but Christie escaped with friends, although he was wounded by a gunshot. Christie never went to trial.\n\nIn 1891 marshals served another warrant for Christie's arrest. He had moved to a more isolated area away from Talhequah, and built a fortified house at Wauhillau. Today it is often referred to as Ned's Fort. The \"fort\" was a double-log-thick home with sand poured between the logs. He made openings only large enough to see from and put a rifle through. Heck announced his demand for Christie's surrender using a traditional Cherokee war cry - the sound of a turkey gobbling. The only response was a gunfight that kept the posse away, and during which Marshal Isbell was seriously wounded. Thomas then decided to burn Christie out. First the marshals set fire to Christie's blacksmith shop. The flames then spread to the cabin. Christie's wife and his nephew, Little Arch Wolf, escaped the burning cabin, although the nephew was wounded by gunfire. Believing that Christie had been killed, Heck and the posse left the scene to obtain medical attention for Isbell, who had already lost a lot of blood. Nancy Christie returned to the burned-out cabin after the wreckage cooled and found her husband wounded but still alive. She dragged him to safety and got him and the Wolf boy to a local white doctor. The white doctor and a Cherokee medicine man saved the lives of Ned and Wolf. According to Frates, this was when Ned Christie declared his one-man war against the U.S. government and swore that he would never surrender.\n\nRecovering from his narrow escape, Ned and his friends built a fort for protection. The fort was double-walled with logs and had sand packed between the two walls. It also had gun ports for rifles and was amply stocked with food, water and ammunition to withstand a siege. During this time, the U.S. Government increased the reward for Ned Christie's capture from $500 to $1000. In October 1892, Marshal Yoes sent a posse of six deputies to Christie's known location. This group was forced to withdraw after two men were wounded in a firefight.\n\nYoes then proposed a military-style raid on the fort. It was led by Deputy Gideon S. “Cap” White, a former captain in the U.S. Cavalry during the Civil War. Gus York, a civilian who was familiar with the territory, was hired to assist White, along with 14 other men. An army post in Kansas agreed to loan White a cannon for the expedition. White's force surrounded the Christie fort on the morning of November 3, 1892. In addition to Ned, the fort was occupied that morning by his wife Nancy, her son Albert, Ned's daughter, Mary, his granddaughter, Charlotte, Little Arch Wolf, and Charles Hair, a young Cherokee. After the first exchange of rifle fire, the marshals allowed the women and children to leave for safety elsewhere.\nIn 1892, Christie was killed by a posse of lawmen, who attacked his fort with the cannon and dynamite. Frustrated that the cannon balls could not penetrate the fort walls, the lawmen loaded a double charge of powder into the cannon. The next shot instead blew up the cannon, rendering it useless by shattering the barrel. The attackers then managed to push a wagon load of dynamite against one wall. When the marshals detonated the dynamite, the explosion destroyed part of the fort and set the rest afire. Ned was shot and killed while running out of the ruined fort toward the posse. They tied his body to a door for transport by train to Fayetteville, Arkansas. There lawmen had themselves photographed with Christie's body as a trophy of their capturing the \"notorious outlaw\" who had held off the government for years. Then they transported the body by train to Fort Smith, Arkansas, to gain their reward. Again people had their pictures taken next to Christie's body. The Cook photography studio took a photo to reproduce and sell as postcards. Christie's body was released by authorities to his family, who took it to Wauhillau for burial. The body was interred at the Watt Christie Cemetery in Wauhillau, where its location is marked by a tombstone.\n\nIn 1918, a man named Dick Humphreys came forward to authorities and stated he had seen the killing of Marshal Maples. He said that Christie didn't shoot him, but that a man named Bud Trainer did. Humphries had not said anything earlier because he feared that Trainer would come back to kill him. Christie was cleared at last. Christie's opposition to railroad development in Indian Territory made him many powerful enemies. Some researchers believe that this may have contributed to him being falsely accused of the murder of Maples. \n\nToday Christie is honored by a plaque at the Cherokee Court House in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the oldest public building in the state. The memorial reads that he was \"assassinated by U. S. Marshals in 1892.\" The Fort Smith Historical Site also has material recognizing Christie's assassination.\n\nMany articles about Christie were published in newspapers and western magazines, as his story captured people's imaginations. Christie was also the subject of novels, such as \"Zeke and Ned\" by Larry McMurtry and Diana Osana, and \"Ned Christie's War\" by Robert Conley. Several non-fiction books have been written, including \"He Was a Brave Man\" by Lisa LaRue. Christie's great-great-nephew Roy J. Hamilton wrote a non-fiction account of his life, titled \"Ned Christie: Cherokee Warrior\".\n\n"}

Nicolas was the son of Joseph Rieussec, a merchant born in the 18th century in Lespinassière, in Languedoc, then one of the largest provinces in the kingdom of France. Today, Lespinassière is located in Aude, one of the five départements of the Languedoc-Roussillon region.\n\nJoseph Rieussec was in Paris at the end of 1778, although no one knows when he left his birthplace, the town of Lespinassière, for the kingdom's capital. His wife, Jeanne Michateau, was expecting. \nOn January 20, 1779, she gave birth to their first son, Nicolas Joseph. \nOn July 20, 1781, a few years before the outbreak of a revolution that was to lead to an upheaval in France and all of Europe, a younger brother arrived and was named Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec. The baby was baptised three days after his birth in the parish of Sainte-Marie du Temple. Nicolas Mathieu Bogganio, a banker residing on the Rue des Victoires in Paris, stood godfather, and the godmother was Marie Victoire Griveau, also residing on the Rue des Victoires. \nJoseph Rieussec held a literary salon. On an unknown date, probably between 1786 and 1788, he remarried Cécile Paillard. The family grew with the arrival of a third child, Lucile Clotilde Cécile, born on October 25, 1788. She died in 1818. Joseph Rieussec died in 1838.\nSome may be astonished that Nicolas Mathieu was born in Paris. It is true that several sources put his birth in Toulouse, sometimes on September 1, 1781, which is not supported by a single document. In contrast, the royal warrant naming Nicolas Mathieu a Watchmaker to the King, is accompanied by a baptismal certificate from the registry of the Sainte-Marie-du-Temple parish in Paris.\n\nStill a minor, young Rieussec was set up as a watchmaker at no. 14, Rue du Marché-Palu, on the Île de la Cité. \nThe Almanac du commerce de Paris pour l’an XIII (Paris Business Yearbook for Year XIII), i.e., 1805, lists 190 watchmakers, including the renowned Breguet. Rieussec does not appear. In contrast, five years later, he is listed among the 222 watchmakers in Paris. He did business at no. 14, Rue du Marché-Palu.\nMarried to Anne Marie Delan, he had a son named Joseph-Ferdinand, born on December 15, 1804, a few days after Napoleon was crowned Emperor of the French. Two years later, Rieussec became a widower. His wife, born July 21, 1780, died on May 1, 1806. Less than a year later, on February 7, 1807, Nicolas Mathieu married Marie Pierrette Flore Bourdin in Sainte-Marguerite church. Time passed. The year 1815 and Waterloo arrived, during which Napoleon and his Empire was swept away in defeat.\n\nWith the royalty restored, the throne passed to a Bourbon, Louis XVIII, brother of the late Louis XVI, who had been guillotined in 1793. All indications are that the new king did not consider Rieussec to be a loyal follower of Napoleon, or to have a black mark against his past. From 1817 on, Rieussec practiced his profession at no. 13, Rue Notre-Dame-des-Petits-Champs. Curiously, he also had a currency exchange there for an indeterminate period of time. That same year, the young watchmaker began to gain recognition when he was named a Watchmaker to the King in a royal warrant dated January 31, 1817.\n\n“On this thirty-first day of January, eighteen hundred and seventeen, the King at Paris, having been made fully aware of the good life and moral conduct of Sieur Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec, and of the distinguished reputation he has acquired in his profession of Watchmaker, desires to confer upon him a mark of his favour and of the protection with which he honours him; for this purpose, His Majesty has granted and does grant him the title of his Watchmaker so that said Sieur Rieussec can enjoy all the honours, prerogatives and other benefits thereunto appertaining; His Majesty desires and intends that he may use said Title at all gatherings and on all public documents […].”\n\nIn 1817, there were already five Watchmakers to the King in Paris: Lepaute, Le Roy, Lépine, Robin, and Lamygonge. Rieussec was the sixth. It was not by chance that this honour had been obtained. Since 1815/1816, Nicolas Mathieu had been entrusted with “maintenance of the clocks for the Minister of the King’s Household,” or in other words the Royal Furniture Depository. Created at the beginning of the 17th century, the Royal Furniture Depository was the government office responsible for managing furniture and artwork used to furnish and decorate the royal residences.\n\nAn ambitious man, Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec did not stop with this warrant. Scarcely had he been named a Watchmaker to the King when he sought another warrant as Watchmaker to the Crown's Furniture Depository. Between May and June 1817, Rieussec sent a letter to the Baron de la Ville d’Avray, the general superintendent of the Royal Furniture Depository. Having worked for the Depository for nearly two years, Rieussec considered that he had a right to this warrant. Such a request was astonishing, as witnessed by the following letter dated May or June 1817.\n\n“Now that Warrants as Watchmakers to the Royal Furniture Depository are being conferred, he feels that in asking for one, he is requesting only what is his due, since it is a consequence of his employment.\nSieur Rieussec believes he is all the more justified since, out of six warrants with this title that were just conferred, only four of the watchmakers are, like himself, employed by the Royal Furniture Depository, and two (Messrs. Leroy and Lépine) are not at all, and so have been better treated than him if his request is not granted.\nCould the Watchmaker to the King warrant be regarded as a favour that would cause the other to be refused him? He cannot convince himself of that, for he values possession of the former too highly to believe that anyone could consider it a precluding honour.\nHe therefore believes that the title of Watchmaker to the King does not influence the question of the other title in the slightest, and that that question is resolved by the legitimate rights conferred upon him by the duties he performs.\nSieur Rieussec does not seek to hold two titles; his ambition was satisfied when he was granted the Warrant as Watchmaker to the King.\nThis is a right that he is asserting now. It is a favour obtained by Messrs. Leroy and Lépine, who are not employed by the Royal Furniture Depository at all. In contrast, Sieur Rieussec is indeed one of [His Majesty’s] watchmakers.”\n\nHe had no choice but to wait, especially since the warrant list for 1817 was already closed. The wait was a short one. \nIn 1818, he was granted a warrant as Watchmaker to the Royal Furniture Depository.\n\nThe decade of the 1820s was one of the most prosperous in Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec's life. It certainly did get off to an auspicious start. September 1, 1821, found Rieussec at the Champ-de-Mars in Paris - not as a race spectator come to watch the Arrondissement de la Seine race, but as a watchmaker testing a “chronometer intended to consistently measure the time horses take to travel the prescribed race distances - not only the winning horse, but also all those that cross the line after it.“\nRieussec's presence at the Arrondissement de la Seine race was not by chance. His elder brother, Nicolas Joseph, was an important person in French equestrian circles, which at the time were growing rapidly. Sixteen years earlier, on August 31, 1805, an imperial decree had established horse racing. It was in this context that, before 1805, Nicolas Joseph had founded the Buc stud farm, prior to purchasing that of Viroflay a few years later in 1812. He is also considered the promoter of the thoroughbred in France. Horse racing was the fashion, and young watchmaker Nicolas Mathieu quickly saw it as an opportunity to use his skill. Running the horses and determining the winner was one thing. Being able to measure the time for each of the racers was quite another. At this time, early in the 19th century, the need was felt for an instrument that could accomplish this.\n\nOn September 1, 1820, many prominent figures had come to the Champ-de-Mars. A practised eye would have recognized Joseph Jérôme, Comte Siméon, Minister, Junior Minister in the Ministry of the Interior; and Gaspard de Chabrol, Prefect of the Seine [département].\n\nChabrol's support was doubtless unnecessary, since the Minister had expressed his “kindness” to Rieussec the same day, giving him reason to “hope for a patent on the basis of public utility.” Both the Race Jury's report and Prefect Chabrol's letter referred to Rieussec's invention as a “chronometer” or a “timer.” There was as yet no mention of a “chronograph.” The tests were judged to be satisfactory for the time being, as witnessed by the Race Jury's report. Rieussec's invention met a real need. Better yet, it was a comfortable and reliable way to measure the times. Henceforth, there was “no fear of any errors.” It seemed destined for a promising future!\n\nIn the minutes of its meeting held October 15, 1821, the French Academy of Sciences reports on Rieussec's invention, which he had presented to them two weeks earlier and which was examined by two of its members, Breguet and Prony. As Rieussec later wrote to Comte Siméon, it was this prestigious company that was the first to call his invention the “Chronograph with Seconds Indicator.” The expression caught on to such a point that it replaced “chronometer” and “timer.” Then and for all time to come, the term became “Rieussec’s chronograph.” Having the Academy's minutes is no small advantage. They provide a description of the chronograph and its operation that is among the most comprehensive in existence:\n\n”The volume and shape of this instrument are about those of a large pocket chronometer. The dial is movable and turns about an axis that is perpendicular to its plane and passes through its centre. When the Chronograph is operating, this dial makes one revolution per minute, and since its circumference is divided into 60 parts, the angular motion of one division corresponds to one second. A small window next to the hanging ring reveals a number, which is replaced by another number with each revolution of the dial and indicates the minutes; the Chronograph can run about three-quarters of an hour without stopping.\nTo use this instrument, when it is mounted and in a resting state, one first sets the divisions marking the time to the starting points by turning a knurled knob with one’s hand. Through the intermediary of a gear train, the knob causes the minute and second dials to move. Having done this, when the moment to start timing arrives, one presses a small button next to the knob to set the machine in motion. The observer can give full attention to the phenomena whose successive time intervals he wishes to measure, and as soon as one of the divisions of these intervals is reached, he presses a second button next to the one we have just mentioned. At the moment when it is pressed a small pen, or metal point, passing through the open tip of a cone filled with black oil ink and placed opposite the moving dial’s fixed zero point, marks a point on the circumference that is divided into seconds. This point then indicates the second and fraction of a second corresponding to the beginning or end of the period of time being measured.\nOperation of the pen trigger mechanism neither stops nor slows the moving dial’s motion, so the button can be pressed several times while this motion lasts, making a number of black points on the scale divided into 60 parts; each point indicates, by its position, the moment when it was marked.\nTo stop the chronograph quickly, one need only press the button that started it. The mechanism is arranged such that pressing this button abruptly changes the current state of the machine, making it pass from a resting state to movement or from movement to its resting state.\nWe did not examine the inside of the instrument, and we do not think that it offers anything particularly remarkable, given the current state of watchmaking. Its principal merit lies in its ability to instantly indicate the first and last moments of several successive time intervals by means of permanent, visible signs on a moving dial, without requiring the attention of the observer’s eyes or ears.\nA chronograph with such a property unquestionably offers precious resources to physicians, engineers and, in general, anyone who measures phenomena. A highly satisfactory trial was recently made at public horse races; but its use can obviously extend to an infinite variety of other kinds of observations, the testing of moving machines, gauging of running water, and almost all hydraulic operations. The passage of a star over the cross-hairs of a telescope, when the astronomer has only one free hand, will be very precisely indicated by this new means, which will either serve to verify the count of the seconds on a clock, or will replace such a count if the distant location of the clock or poor hearing keeps the escapement from being heard. […]\nWe think that Mr. Rieussec’s Chronograph deserves the Academy’s approval.\n\nIn summary, on October 14, 1821, Rieussec presented his invention to the Academy of Sciences, which christened it a \"chronograph\". The term was particularly well chosen: \"chronograph\" comes from the Greek words \"chronos\" and \"graphin\", which means “that which writes time”. This system works as follows: a nib places a black mark on the dial at the moment when the phenomenon being measured ends. So the user can read the duration of the phenomenon - a horse race or something else - on the dial thanks to the time \"written\" by the hand. The chronograph was born!\n\nArmed with the reports from the Race Jury and the Academy of Sciences, Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec sent a letter to “His Excellency, Comte Siméon, Minister, Junior Minister in the Ministry of the Interior.” Ambitious, he reminded the minister that the minister had given him cause to hope for “a Patent on the basis of public utility.” To support his request, he attached a copy of the previously mentioned reports and “the plans and designs for the component parts of the race Chronograph and of the one used for astronomy and for observation of phenomena requiring the strictest accuracy.” This last point is important. It tells that right from the beginning, Rieussec made two different chronographs - one tested at the 1821 Arrondissement de la Seine race, the other presented before the Academy of Sciences that same year.\nRieussec's application, recorded by the Ministry of the Interior's departments, was examined by the Advisory Committee for Arts and Factories at a meeting on December 22, 1821. \nAt its meeting on March 2, 1822, the Advisory Committee acknowledged the following facts: “Sieur Rieussec, Watchmaker to the King in Paris, requests a five-year patent for a timepiece that he calls a Chronograph. The description and design furnished by the petitioner were sufficiently clear and detailed; nothing stands in the way of granting the Patent.” One week later, on March 9, 1822, Rieussec obtained a five-year patent for a “Timepiece, or timer for distance covered, called a chronograph with seconds indicator, indicating the duration of several successive phenomena without requiring the observer’s attention.”\nIn his application packet, Rieussec justifies the improvements he believed he had made to his chronograph. The following text is an excerpt from his justification:\n\n“The first Chronographs, for which I obtained a Patent in 1821, were too large in size to be easily transportable as watches, due to the complicated parts that made up the mechanism.\n“Since that time I have attempted to simplify the mechanism enough so that chronographs could be incorporated into very small watches, and as will be seen in the description < >, I have even combined the chronograph movement and the watch movement in a single case, such that this instrument is always available to use. The simplifications that I have added are such that I can adapt this mechanism even to the most ordinary watches and put them on the market at a very moderate price.”\n\nHe was granted the patent on January 16, 1838. Apart from the simplifications noted above, Rieussec made another important modification to his chronographs. From that time on, they had a fixed dial and a moving hand.\n\nStill, it was not until the fall of 1837 that Rieussec filed a patent application for \"Improvements to Chronographs\". The wording of this application sounds like a manifesto: Ten-year patent for invention and various significant improvements made to chronographs, which he states he invented and improved.\nIn his application packet, Rieussec justifies the improvements he believed he had made to his chronograph. Here is an excerpt from his justification:\n\n”The first Chronographs, for which I obtained a Patent in 1821, were too large in size to be easily transportable as watches, due to the complicated parts that made up the mechanism.\nSince that time I have attempted to simplify the mechanism enough so that Cronographs could be incorporated into very small watches, and as will be seen in the description […], I have even combined the chronograph movement and the watch movement in a single case, such that this instrument is always available to use. The simplifications that I have added are such that I can adapt this mechanism even to the most ordinary watches and put them on the market at a very moderate price.”\n\nHe was granted the patent on January 16, 1838. Apart from the simplifications noted above, Rieussec made another important modification to his chronographs. From that time on, they had a fixed dial and a moving hand.\n\nOn the eve of 1830, Nicolas Mathieu's brother Nicolas Joseph Rieussec was interested in selling heating wood. It was in this context of a new business being developed by his brother that our watchmaker filed two new patents, both completely unrelated to watchmaking. On September 5, 1832, he drew up an application for “a cart for transporting heating wood to a residence [and called a] cart with measuring device [voiture porte mesure] or improved dray.”\nAn excerpt from one of the documents submitted with the file helps to imagine Rieussec's project:\n\n“This cart differs from those known as measuring carts [voitures mesures] mainly in that in these last, the frame that contains the wood to be transported, which is longer and more cumbersome, is placed above the axle and is part of the body of the cart, which necessitates the use of wheels with a small diameter to avoid having it be too high, but then one can see how difficult it is for the horse that has to pull the full cart, especially if it meets with an obstacle.\nIn contrast, the frame of the cart with measuring device is suspended beneath the axle, which allows for the use of large wheels […].”\nHe was granted a five-year patent on October 5, 1832. Some months later, Rieussec drew up a new application, again for an invention related to heating wood. This time, he claimed “a new and improved system of devices for sawing, weighing and measuring residential heating wood.” \nRieussec's interest in heating wood is astonishing, for being so much a part of another time. Yet he did express real concern for some of his contemporaries’ daily concerns. Rieussec's career as an inventor did not stop there. In 1860, at the age of 79, he filed another patent application, his last. This time, it was for a “snuffbox system called the Rieussec Snuffbox.” \nRieussec's last invention showed a concern for health that was before its time.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the French industrial sector was expanding rapidly. Its newness led public authorities to work toward encouraging a “copycat effect.” Consequently, industry lived by the rhythm of the expositions devoted to its products. From 1823 to 1855, Rieussec was a regular participant in these exhibitions, which initially were held every four years. The first world's fair was held in 1851, in London. Rieussec was there. In 1855, Paris hosted another world's fair, which gave the Second Empire an opportunity to celebrate industry and modernity.\nThese expositions were an opportunity for Rieussec to collect new honours. In 1823, he exhibited an “astronomical clock with seconds, and a watch of his own invention, which he calls a chronograph.” This earned him a bronze medal. He was also among the exhibitors in 1839, when he introduced a new-style chronograph, after having obtained a patent the year before. The jury awarded him the bronze medal, a repeat of the one received in 1823.\nRieussec was again present at the 1844 exposition. That year, “the jury [was] delighted to acknowledge how prolific Mr. Rieussec’s invention has been in terms of useful applications, and hasten[ed] to do him justice by awarding him a silver medal.” In 1851, he was in London exhibiting in the Crystal Palace. Once again, his products, attracted notice. “The ingenuity of the mechanical combinations used by Mr. Rieussec to conveniently and reliably obtain a result so valuable to experimenters so impressed the London jury that the creator of this mechanism was unanimously found worthy of the first prize, and - to the great regret of all the judges - was deprived of it only by the clause in the rules stipulating that the highest award could not be given to an invention more than twenty years old.” Which, however, did not prevent him from being awarded a prize medal. The 1855 world's fair was the crowning achievement of Rieussec's watchmaking career, as “this veteran of French watchmaking” was awarded a first-class medal.\n\nRieussec's work was not limited to sophisticated measuring instruments such as the chronograph, intended to make official measurements of time intervals, whether for horse races or scientific phenomena. His activity as Watchmaker to the Royal Furniture Depository gave him an opportunity to create movements for the clocks ordered to decorate certain rooms of the royal residences. In 1821, Rieussec delivered a clock called “Iris fastening on her wings” intended for the bedchamber of the Duke of Bordeaux, who was the grandson of the Count of Artois, brother of King Louis XVIII.\nBetween 1820 and 1825, Rieussec signed a movement for a clock depicting Saint Vincent de Paul. This object was brought to Saint-Cloud castle in early 1826. \nIn 1821, more active than ever, Rieussec delivered a superb clock representing “Sappho inspired by Love,” followed by a “Homer singing over the ruins of Troy”clock which he delivered to the Royal Furniture Depository that same year. During the last years of the Restoration (1815–1830) or the first years of the July Monarchy (1830–1848), Rieussec signed a movement for a clock representing the shepherd Belisarius, inspired by a painting shown by the painter Gérard at the Salon of 1795.\nThese few examples are an accurate reflection of Nicolas Rieussec's great productivity between 1820 and the end of the Restoration. Having been Watchmaker to Louis XVIII (1815–1824), then to his brother Charles X (1824–1830), Rieussec remained a Watchmaker to the King under the following regime. Louis-Philippe, who was king from 1830 to 1848, appreciated Rieussec's work enough to keep him in his service. It was also during this time that Rieussec became associated with another watchmaker, Chaudé.\n\nThe genealogies that were able to consult for this article repeatedly note that Joseph Ferdinand, the son of Nicolas Mathieu, born December 15, 1804, was a Watchmaker to the King. To date, there has not been found any document confirming this. It remains to be seen whether Joseph Ferdinand followed in his father's footsteps and became a watchmaker. One passage in the property inventory made after Nicolas Mathieu's death implies that the father left his business to his son. Here, again, there is no evidence attesting to the son's watchmaking activity. Everything there is to know about this is that when his father died, Joseph Ferdinand was a merchant and lived at no. 183, Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Germain, now Rue de Grenelle.\n\nNicolas Mathieu Rieussec died at his home at 60 Avenue du Bel-Air in Paris, in 1866. The declaration of succession drawn up after his death noted that he was a gentleman of independent means at the time. His heirs were his son Joseph Ferdinand and the daughters of his own daughter, Marie Clotilde, who had died young in 1842.\nThe inventory of Nicolas Mathieu's property, drawn up after his death, noted that the deceased was a Knight in the Order of the Legion of Honour. Unfortunately, there has been no trace of his file in the National Archives where the Legion of Honour's records are kept.\n\n"}
{"id": "21703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21703", "title": "Noah", "text": "Noah\n\nIn Abrahamic religions, Noah ( ) was the tenth and last of the pre-Flood Patriarchs. The story of Noah's Ark is told in the Bible's Genesis flood narrative. The biblical account is followed by the story of the Curse of Ham.\n\nIn addition to the Book of Genesis, Noah is mentioned in the Old Testament in the First Book of Chronicles, and the books of Tobit, Wisdom, Sirach, Isaiah, Ezekiel, 2 Esdras, 4 Maccabees; in the New Testament, he is mentioned in the gospels of Matthew, and Luke, the Epistle to the Hebrews, 1st Peter and 2nd Peter. Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the Quran (Surahs 71, 7, 1, and 21).\n\nThe primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the Book of Genesis.\n\nNoah was the tenth of the pre-flood (antediluvian) Patriarchs. His father was Lamech and his mother is not named in the biblical accounts. When Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth ().\n\nThe Genesis flood narrative makes up chapters 6–9 in the Book of Genesis, in the Bible. The narrative, one of many flood myths found in human cultures, indicates that God intended to return the Earth to its pre-Creation state of watery chaos by flooding the Earth because of humanity's misdeeds and then remake it using the microcosm of Noah's ark. Thus, the flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of creation. The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to destroy the world by the way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God's guarantee (the Noahic Covenant) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood.\n\nAfter the flood, Noah offered burnt offerings to God, who said: \"I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart \"[is]\" evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done\" ().\n\n\"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth\" (). They were also told that all fowls, land animals, and fishes would be afraid of them. Furthermore, as well as green plants, every moving thing would be their food with the exception that the blood was not to be eaten. Man's life blood would be required from the beasts and from man. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\" (9:6). A rainbow, called \"my bow\", was given as the sign of a covenant \"between me and you and every living creature that \"[is]\" with you, for perpetual generations\" (), called the Noahic covenant or the rainbow covenant.\n\nNoah died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950, the last of the extremely long-lived antediluvian Patriarchs. The maximum human lifespan, as depicted by the Bible, diminishes thereafter, from almost 1,000 years to the 120 years of Moses.\n\nAfter the flood, the Bible says that Noah became a husbandman and he planted a vineyard. He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay \"uncovered\" within his tent. Noah's son Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his brothers, which led to Ham's son Canaan being cursed by Noah. As early as the Classical era, commentators on have excused Noah's excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker; the first person to discover the effects of wine. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, and a Church Father, wrote in the 4th Century that Noah's behavior is defensible: as the first human to taste wine, he would not know its effects: \"Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink, fell into a drunken stupor\".\n\nPhilo, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, also excused Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners: (1) to drink wine in excess, a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or (2) to partake of wine as the wise man, Noah being the latter.\n\nIn Jewish tradition and rabbinic literature on Noah, rabbis blame Satan for the intoxicating properties of the wine.\n\nIn the field of psychological biblical criticism, J. H. Ellens and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\". A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at Canaan for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as and .\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as seen in and .\n\n sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood. Among Japheth’s descendants were the maritime nations. (10:2–5) Ham’s son Cush had a son named Nimrod, who became the first man of might on earth, a mighty hunter, king in Babylon and the land of Shinar. (10:6–10) From there Asshur went and built Nineveh. (10:11–12) Canaan’s descendants Sidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites spread out from Sidon as far as Gerar, near Gaza, and as far as Sodom and Gomorrah. (10:15–19) Among Shem’s descendants was Eber. (10:21)\n\nThese genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring. It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the Tower of Babel, which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.\n\nAccording to the documentary hypothesis, the first five books of the Bible (Pentateuch/Torah), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC. Two of these, the Jahwist, composed in the 10th century BC, and the Priestly source, from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah. The attempt by the 5th-century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took, and how long the flood lasted.\n\n\"The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible\" notes that this story echoes parts of the Garden of Eden story: Noah is the first vintner, while Adam is the first farmer; both have problems with their produce; both stories involve nakedness; and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse. However, after the flood, the stories differ. Noah plants the vineyard and utters the curse, not God, so \"God is less involved\".\n\nNoah appears in several non-canonical books.\n\nThe Book of Jubilees refers to Noah and says that he was taught the arts of healing by an angel so that his children could overcome \"the offspring of the Watchers\".\n\nIn 10:1–3 of the Book of Enoch (which is part of the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon), Uriel was dispatched by \"the Most High\" to inform Noah of the approaching \"deluge\".\n\nThere are 20 or so fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls that appear to refer to Noah. Lawrence Schiffman writes, \"Among the Dead Sea Scrolls at least three different versions of this legend are preserved.\" In particular, \"The Genesis Apocryphon devotes considerable space to Noah.\" However, \"The material seems to have little in common with Genesis 5 which reports the birth of Noah.\" Also, Noah's father is reported as worrying that his son was actually fathered by one of the Watchers.\n\nIndian and Greek flood-myths also exist, although there is little evidence that they were derived from the Mesopotamian flood-myth that underlies the biblical account.\n\nThe Noah story of the Pentateuch is almost identical to a flood story contained in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, composed about 2000 BC. In the Gilgamesh version, the Mesopotamian gods are enraged by the noise that man has raised from the earth. To quiet them they decide to send a great flood to silence mankind. Various correlations between the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh (the flood, the construction of the ark, the salvation of animals, and the release of birds following the flood) have led to this story being seen as the inspiration for the story of Noah. The few variations include the number of days of the deluge, the order of the birds, and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests. The flood story in Genesis 6–8 matches the Gilgamesh flood myth so closely that \"few doubt that [it] derives from a Mesopotamian account.\" What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale \"point by point and in the same order\", even when the story permits other alternatives.\n\nThe earliest written flood myth is found in the Mesopotamian Epic of Atrahasis and Epic of Gilgamesh texts. The \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" says \"These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark, its flotation, and the subsidence of the waters, as well as the part played by the human protagonist.\" The \"Encyclopedia Judaica\" adds that there is a strong suggestion that \"an intermediate agent was active. The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the Hurrians, whose territory included the city of Haran, where the Patriarch Abraham had his roots. The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia\".\nThe encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories: Noah is the tenth patriarch and Berossus notes that \"the hero of the great flood was Babylonia’s tenth antediluvian king.\" However, there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes. For the Mesopotamian antecedents, \"the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18,600 to nearly 65,000 years.\" In the Bible, the lifespans \"fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts.\" Also, the name of the hero differs between the traditions: \"The earliest Mesopotamian flood account, written in the Sumerian language, calls the deluge hero Ziusudra.\"\n\nGilgamesh’s historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC, shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish, two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.\n\nThe earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur (2100–2000 BC). One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh’s journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story. The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to ca. 2000–1500 BC. Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh’s journey to meet Utnapishtim. The \"standard\" Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC.\n\nNoah has often been compared to Deucalion, the son of Prometheus and Pronoia in Greek mythology. Like Noah, Deucalion is warned of the flood (by Zeus and Poseidon); he builds an ark and staffs it with creatures – and when he completes his voyage, gives thanks and takes advice from the gods on how to repopulate the Earth. Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch. Deucalion, in some versions of the myth, also becomes the inventor of wine, like Noah. Philo and Justin equate Deucalion with Noah, and Josephus used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that, therefore, Noah existed.\n\nThe righteousness of Noah is the subject of much discussion among rabbis. The description of Noah as \"righteous in his generation\" implied to some that his perfection was only relative: In his generation of wicked people, he could be considered righteous, but in the generation of a \"tzadik\" like Abraham, he would not be considered so righteous. They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed, as Abraham prayed for the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah. In fact, Noah is never seen to speak; he simply listens to God and acts on his orders. This led some commentators to offer the figure of Noah as \"the man in a fur coat,\" who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour. Others, such as the medieval commentator Rashi, held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over 120 years, deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent. Rashi interprets his father's statement of the naming of Noah (in Hebrew נֹחַ) \"This one will comfort us (in Hebrew– yeNaHamainu יְנַחֲמֵנו) in our work and in the toil of our hands, which come from the ground that the Lord had cursed\", by saying Noah heralded a new era of prosperity, when there was easing (in Hebrew – nahah – נחה) from the curse from the time of Adam when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat and that Noah then introduced the plow.\n\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"The Book of Genesis contains two accounts of Noah.\" In the first, Noah is the hero of the flood, and in the second, he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard. \"The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former.\" Perhaps the original name of the hero of the flood was actually \"Enoch\".\n\nThe Encyclopedia Judaica notes that Noah's drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior. Rather, \"It is clear that ... Noah’s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel’s Canaanite neighbors.\" It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father’s nakedness. Yet, \"Noah’s curse, ...is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham.\" (p. 288)\n\n2 Peter 2:5 refers to Noah as a \"preacher of righteousness\". In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, Jesus compares Noah's flood with the coming Day of Judgement: \"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.\"\n\nThe First Epistle of Peter compares the saving power of baptism with the Ark saving those who were in it. In later Christian thought, the Ark came to be compared to the Church: salvation was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship, as in Noah's time it had been found only within the Ark. St Augustine of Hippo (354–430), demonstrated in \"The City of God\" that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which corresponds to the body of Christ; the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the Anglican rite of baptism, which asks God, \"who of thy great mercy didst save Noah,\" to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised.\n\nIn medieval Christianity, Noah's three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known continents, Japheth/Europe, Shem/Asia, and Ham/Africa, although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society – the priests (Shem), the warriors (Japheth), and the peasants (Ham). In medieval Christian thought, Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa. So, in racialist arguments, the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races.\n\nIsaac Newton, in his religious works on the development of religion, wrote about Noah and his offspring. In Newton's view, while Noah was a monotheist, the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants.\n\nIn Mormon theology, Noah plays an important role, prior to his birth, as the angel Gabriel, and then lived in his mortal life as the patriarch-prophet Noah. Gabriel and Noah are regarded as the same individual under different names. Mormons also believe that Noah returned to earth as Gabriel after his earthly life and appeared to Daniel to teach him about the Second Coming; to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist; and to Mary, the mother of Jesus.\n\nNoah is considered the head of a dispensation along with Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Joseph Smith. A dispensation is a period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. Noah became the means by which the gospel of Jesus Christ— the plan of salvation —is revealed anew, the means by which divine transforming powers, including saving covenants and ordinances, are extended to people during an age of time called a dispensation.\n\nNoah is a highly important figure in Islam and he is seen as one of the most significant of all prophets. The Quran contains 43 references to Noah, or \"Nuḥ\", in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, \"Sūrat Nūḥ\" (), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the Deluge. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Qur'an, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).\n\nThe Qur'an focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a covenant with Noah just as he did with Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72–74). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. Noah prays to God, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels from the land: / For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels.\" The Qur'an narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an Ark, after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop Mount Judi ().\n\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.\n\nAccording to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his dispensation, which extended until the time of Ibrahim (Abraham, 950 years). The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress, which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah.\n\nAn important Gnostic text, the \"Apocryphon of John\", reports that the chief archon caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made, but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon's plans, and Noah informed the remainder of humanity. Unlike the account of Genesis, not only are Noah's family saved, but many others also heed Noah's call. There is no ark in this account. According to Elaine Pagels, \"Rather, they hid in a particular place, not only Noah, but also many other people from the unshakable race. They entered that place and hid in a bright cloud.\"\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic. In Bahá'í belief, only Noah's followers were spiritually alive, preserved in the ark of his teachings, as others were spiritually dead. The Bahá'í scripture \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\" endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had a large number of companions, either 40 or 72, besides his family on the Ark, and that he taught for 950 (symbolic) years before the flood.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "545253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=545253", "title": "Rick Perry", "text": "Rick Perry\n\nJames Richard \"Rick\" Perry (born March 4, 1950) is an American politician who is the 14th and current United States Secretary of Energy, serving in the Cabinet of Donald Trump. Prior to his cabinet position, Perry served as the 47th Governor of Texas from December 2000 to January 2015. A Republican, he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1998 and assumed the governorship in December 2000 when Governor George W. Bush resigned to become president. Perry was the longest-serving Governor in Texas history.\n\nPerry was elected three times to full gubernatorial terms and is the fourth Texas Governor (after Allan Shivers, Price Daniel and John Connally) to serve three terms. With a tenure in office of 14 years, 30 days, Perry was, at the time he left office, the second longest-serving current governor (after Terry Branstad of Iowa). Perry ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for president in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOn December 14, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Perry as his Secretary of Energy. On March 2, 2017, he was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 62–37 vote.\n\nA fifth-generation Texan, he was born on March 4, 1950, in Haskell, Texas, and raised in Paint Creek, Texas, the son of dryland cotton farmers Joseph Ray Perry and Amelia June Holt Perry. He has one older sister. Perry's ancestry is almost entirely English, dating as far back as the original Thirteen Colonies. His family has been in Texas since before the Texas Revolution.\n\nHis father, a Democrat, was a long-time Haskell County commissioner and school board member. Perry has said that his interest in politics probably began in November 1961, when his father took him to the funeral of U.S. Representative Sam Rayburn.\n\nPerry was in the Boy Scouts (BSA) and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. The BSA has honored Perry with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. Perry graduated from Paint Creek High School in 1968.\n\nPerry attended Texas A&M University where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets and the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. He was elected senior class social secretary, a member and redpot in Aggie Bonfire, and one of A&M's five \"yell leaders\". He graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree in animal science.\n\nIn 1989, he said that \"I was probably a bit of a free spirit, not particularly structured real well for life outside of a military regime, I would have not lasted at Texas Tech or the University of Texas. I would have hit the fraternity scene and lasted about one semester.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, Perry interned during several summers with Southwestern Advantage, as a door-to-door book salesman. \"I count my time working for Dortch Oldham [then president of the Southwestern family of companies] as one of the most important formative experiences of my life\", Perry said in 2010. \"There is nothing that tests your commitment to a goal like getting a few doors closed in your face.\" He said that \"Mr. Oldham taught legions of young people to communicate quickly, clearly and with passion, a lesson that has served me well in my life since then.\"\n\nUpon graduation from college in 1972, Perry was commissioned as an officer in the United States Air Force and completed pilot training in February 1974. He was then assigned as a C-130 pilot with the 772nd Tactical Airlift Squadron at Dyess Air Force Base, located in Abilene, Texas. Perry's duties included two-month overseas rotations at RAF Mildenhall, located in Mildenhall, England and Rhein-Main Air Base, located at Frankfurt am Main, Germany. His missions included a 1974 U.S. State Department drought relief effort in Mali, Mauritania and Chad, and two years later, earthquake relief in Guatemala. He left the United States Air Force in 1977 with the rank of Captain, returned to Texas, and went into business farming cotton with his father.\n\nIn 1984, Perry was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat from district 64, which included his home county of Haskell. He served on the House Appropriations and Calendars committees during his three two-year terms in office. He befriended fellow freshman state representative Lena Guerrero, a staunch liberal Democrat who endorsed Perry's reelection bid in 2006.\n\nPerry was part of the \"Pit Bulls\", a group of Appropriations members who sat on the lower dais in the committee room (or \"pit\") who pushed for austere state budgets during the 1980s. At one point, \"The Dallas Morning News\" named him one of the ten most effective members of the legislature.\n\nIn 1987, Perry voted for a $5.7 billion tax increase proposed by Republican governor Bill Clements. Perry supported Al Gore in the 1988 Democratic presidential primaries and worked for Gore's campaign in Texas. On September 29, 1989, Perry announced that he was switching parties, becoming a Republican.\n\nIn 1990, as a newly minted Republican, Perry challenged Jim Hightower, the incumbent Democratic Agriculture Commissioner. Karl Rove was Perry's campaign manager.\n\nIn the Republican primary on March 13, 1990, Perry polled 276,558 votes (47%), with Richard McIver garnering 176,976 votes (30%) and Gene L. Duke, who placed third, polling 132,497 votes (23%). Since Perry fell shy of the necessary 50% to win outright, a runoff was held between Perry and McIver set on April 10, 1990. In the runoff, he emerged victorious, garnering 96,649 votes (69%) to McIver's 43,921 votes (31%).\n\nDuring 1990, Hightower's office was embroiled in an FBI investigation into corruption and bribery. Three aides were convicted in 1993 of using public funds for political fundraising, although Hightower himself was not found to be involved in the wrongdoings. Perry narrowly defeated Hightower in November 1990, garnering 1,864,463 votes (49%) to Hightower's 1,820,145 votes (48%).\n\nRove raised $3 million to raise Perry's profile, \"while tarnishing the name of Jim Hightower\" resulting in Perry's name becoming a \"household name in Texas—and Hightower's name synonymous with corruption\".\n\nAs Agriculture Commissioner, Perry was responsible for promoting the sale of Texas farm produce to other states and foreign nations, and for supervising the calibration of weights and measures, such as gasoline pumps and grocery store scales.\n\nIn April 1993, Perry, while serving as Texas agriculture commissioner, expressed support for the effort to reform the nation's healthcare, describing it as \"most commendable\". The healthcare plan, first revealed in September, was ultimately unsuccessful due to Republican congressional opposition. In 2005, after being questioned on the issue by a potential opponent in the Republican governor primary, Perry said that he expressed his support only in order to get Clinton to pay more attention to rural healthcare.\n\nIn 1994, Perry was reelected Agriculture Commissioner by a large margin, getting 2,546,287 votes (62 percent) to Democrat Marvin Gregory's 1,479,692 (36 percent). Libertarian Clyde L. Garland received the remaining 85,836 votes (2 percent). Gregory, a chicken farmer from Sulphur Springs, Texas, was on the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority with Perry in the early nineties as a Republican, but became a Democrat before running against Perry in 1994.\n\nIn 1998, Perry ran for the powerful job of Lieutenant Governor. During this election, Perry had a notable falling out with his previous top political strategist Karl Rove, which began the much-reported rivalry between the Bush and Perry camps. Perry polled 1,858,837 votes (50.04 percent) to the 1,790,106 (48.19 percent) cast for Democrat John Sharp. Perry became the state's first Republican lieutenant governor since Reconstruction, taking office on January 19, 1999.\n\nPerry assumed the office of governor on December 21, 2000, following the resignation of George W. Bush—who was preparing to become President of the United States. He won the office in his own right in the 2002 gubernatorial election, where he received 58% of votes to Laredo oilman and businessman Tony Sanchez's 40%. He was re-elected in the 2006 gubernatorial election against three major opponents, polling 39% of votes against runner-up former U.S. Congressman Chris Bell of Houston with 30%. In the 2010 gubernatorial election, Perry became the first Texas governor to be elected to three four-year terms, polling 55% of votes to former Houston Mayor Bill White's 42%.\n\nAccording to Texans for Public Justice, in his three gubernatorial campaigns, Perry received hard-money campaign contributions of $102 million, half of which came from 204 donors.\n\nIn the 2001 legislative session, Perry set a record for his use of the veto, rejecting 82 acts, more than any other governor in any single legislative session in the history of the state since Reconstruction.\n\nIn 2003, Perry formed the non-profit organization, the OneStar Foundation, designed to connect non-profits with resources and expertise to accomplish their missions and to promote volunteerism. He tapped the state Republican chairman Susan Weddington, who stepped down from that position after six years, as the president of OneStar. She left in 2009, and he chose Elizabeth Seale as her successor.\n\nIn his presidential campaign, Perry highlighted the economic success Texas achieved under his governorship. The efficacy of Perry's economic policies has been questioned by some sources. \n\nA proclaimed proponent of fiscal conservatism, Perry often campaigned on job growth and tax issues, such as his opposition to creating a state income tax. In 2002, Perry refused to promise not to raise taxes as governor, and in the following years did propose or approve various tax and debt increases. In 2009, Perry signed Grover Norquist's pledge to \"oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes\".\n\nTexas began borrowing money in 2003 to pay for roads and was projected to owe $17.3 billion by the end of 2012, increasing total state debt from $13.4 billion in 2001 to $37.8 billion in 2011. The state's public finance authority sold $2 billion in bonds for unemployment benefits, and it was authorized to sell $1.5 billion more if necessary. Texas federal borrowing topped $1.6 billion in October 2010, before the bond sales.\n\nIn 2003, Perry signed legislation that created the Texas Enterprise Fund, which has since given $435 million in grants to businesses. \"The New York Times\" reported that many of the companies receiving grants, or their chief executives, have made contributions to Perry's campaigns or to the Republican Governors Association. (Perry became chairman of the group in 2008 and again in 2011.) Perry was criticized for supporting corporate tax breaks and other incentives, while the state government was experiencing budget deficits.\n\nAs Governor of Texas, Perry received grades of B in 2004, B in 2006, B in 2008, B in 2010, C in 2012, and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.\n\nAs governor, Perry was an opponent of federal health-care reform proposals and of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, describing the latter as \"socialism on American soil\". His focus in Texas was on tort reform, signing a bill in 2003 that restricted non-economic damages in medical malpractice judgments. Perry touted this approach in his presidential campaign, although independent analysts have concluded that it has failed to increase the supply of physicians or limit health-care costs in Texas.\n\nDuring Perry's governorship, Texas rose from second to first among states with the highest proportion of uninsured residents at 26%, and had the lowest level of access to prenatal care in the U.S. Perry and the state legislature cut Medicaid spending. The \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that under Perry, \"working Texans increasingly have been priced out of private healthcare while the state's safety net has withered.\"\n\nPerry's office said that Texas represents a model private-sector approach to health-care. His spokeswoman stated that \"Texas does provide an adequate safety net to those truly in need... and many individuals simply choose not to purchase healthcare coverage.\"\n\nPerry is anti-abortion and has signed bills with rules or restrictions for abortion procedures and funding for them.\n\nIn December 2011, Perry said he had undergone a \"transformation\" and now opposed all abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. The next day he clarified that he would allow an exception for abortions that would save a mother's life.\n\nIn February 2007, Perry issued an executive order mandating that Texas girls receive the HPV vaccine, which protects against some strains of the human papilloma virus, a contributing factor to some forms of cervical cancer. Following the move, news outlets reported various apparent financial connections between Perry and the vaccine's manufacturer, Merck. \n\nMerck's political action committee has contributed $28,500 since 2001 to Perry's campaigns. The order was criticized by some parents and social conservatives, and a lawsuit was filed later that month. In May 2007, the Texas Legislature passed a bill undoing the order; Perry did not veto the bill, saying the veto would have been overruled, but blamed lawmakers who supported the bill for the deaths of future Texan cervical cancer victims.\n\nOn July 1, 2011, Perry both had adult stem cell surgery in Houston and started \"laying the groundwork\" for the commercialization of the adult stem cell industry in Texas.\n\nPerry grew up in the United Methodist Church. He and his family were members of Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin until 2010, when they began attending Lake Hills Church, a non-denominational evangelical megachurch in western Travis County. Perry told the \"Austin American-Statesman\" that he began attending Lake Hills because it was close to the rental home where he and his wife lived while the Governor's Mansion was being renovated.\n\nIn 2006, Perry stated that he believes in the inerrancy of the Bible and that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior will go to hell. A couple of days later, he clarified, \"I don't know that there's any human being that has the ability to interpret what God and his final decision-making is going to be.\"\n\nIn his 2008 book \"On My Honor\", Perry expressed his views on the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \"Let's be clear: I don't believe government, which taxes people regardless of their faith, should espouse a specific faith. I also don't think we should allow a small minority of atheists to sanitize our civil dialogue of religious references.\"\n\nIn June 2011, Perry proclaimed August 6 as a Day of Prayer and Fasting, inviting other governors to join him in a prayer meeting hosted by the American Family Association in Houston. The event was criticized as going beyond prayer and fasting to include launching Perry's presidential campaign.\n\nPerry has called himself \"a firm believer in intelligent design as a matter of faith and intellect\", and has expressed support for its teaching alongside evolution in Texas schools, but has also said that \"educators and local school officials, not the governor, should determine science curriculum\".\n\nIn 2005, Perry said he would not \"approve an education budget that shortchanges teacher salary increases, textbooks, education technology, and education reforms. And I cannot let $2 billion sit in some bank account when it can go directly to the classroom\".\n\nFollowing a second rejection of Perry's bill, Perry asked John Sharp to head a task force charged with preparing a bipartisan education plan, which was subsequently adopted.\n\nIn 2001, Perry expressed his pride in the enactment of the statute extending in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants who meet Texas' residency requirements. It also required the undocumented students to pledge to apply for permanent residency or citizenship if this became a possibility for them. In September 2014, Gov. Perry stated during a debate his continuous support for the program.\n\nIn 2002, Perry described the Texas same-sex anti-sodomy law as \"appropriate\". The following year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the statute in \"Lawrence v. Texas\", determining that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nIn his 2010 book, Perry referenced the \"Lawrence\" decision, writing \"Texans have a different view of the world than do the nine oligarchs in robes.\" In 2011, Perry admitted that he did not know about the \"Lawrence\" decision; when told that the Supreme Court case had struck down Texas's anti-sodomy law, Perry said: \"I'm not taking the bar exam ... I don't know what a lot of legal cases involve ... [M]y position on traditional marriage is clear ... I don't need a federal law case to explain it to me.\"\n\nPerry supported Texas Proposition 2 in 2005, a ballot proposition that amended the Texas constitution by defining marriage as \"only a union between a man and a woman\" and prohibiting the state from creating or recognizing \"any legal status identical or similar to marriage\" (such as civil unions).\n\nIn 2011, after New York legalized same-sex marriage, Perry stated that it was their right to do so under the principle of states' rights in the Tenth Amendment. A spokesman later reiterated Perry's support for a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, saying that position was not inconsistent, since an amendment would require ratification by three-fourths of the states.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" in 2015 that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by the Constitution, Perry condemned the decision, saying: \"I'm a firm believer in traditional marriage, and I also believe the 10th Amendment leaves it to each state to decide this issue.\"\n\nIn his first book, \"On My Honor\", published in 2008, Perry drew a parallel between homosexuality and alcoholism, writing that he is \"no expert on the 'nature versus nurture' debate\" but that gays should simply choose abstinence.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, he criticized the repeal of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for the U.S. military. Perry said using foreign aid as a policy tool against foreign countries that violate the human rights of homosexuals was \"not in America's interests\" and was part of a \"war on traditional American values\".\n\nPerry, an Eagle Scout, has called on the Boy Scouts to continue their ban on homosexuality and blamed America for not living up to the ideals of the Scouts.\n\nPerry's campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor focused on a tough stance on crime. He has supported block grants for crime programs.\n\nJeff L. Blackburn, chief counsel of the Innocence Project of Texas, said of Perry that \"He has done more good than any other governor we've ever had ... unless, of course, it involves the death penalty. On the death penalty, Rick Perry has a profound mental block.\"\n\nIn 2007, Perry signed a law ending automatic arrest for cannabis possession.\n\nPerry supports the death penalty. In June 2001, he vetoed a ban on the execution of mentally retarded inmates. In 2011, during a televised debate for presidential candidates, he said he'd \"never struggled\" with the question of the possible innocence of any of the 234 inmates executed to date while he was governor.\n\nCases in which Perry has been criticized for his lack of intervention include those of Cameron Todd Willingham and Mexican nationals José Medellín and Humberto Leal Garcia.\n\nPerry commuted the death sentence of Kenneth Foster, who was convicted of murder despite evidence that he was only present at the scene of the crime. Foster was convicted under a Texas law that makes co-conspirators liable in certain cases of homicide. In this case, it tied Foster to the triggerman. Perry raised doubts about the law and urged the legislature to re-examine the issue. \"I believe the right and just decision is to commute Foster's sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment\", Perry said in a statement at the time.\n\nPerry also refused to grant a stay of execution in the case of Cameron Todd Willingham even though an investigation by the Texas Forensic Science Commission determined parts of the original investigation may not have looked at all of the evidence correctly. Perry called Willingham a \"monster\" and later replaced the chairman of the Science Commission.\n\nIn 2002, Perry proposed the Trans-Texas Corridor, a $175 billion transportation network that would include a 4,000-mile network of highways, rail, and utility lines and would be funded by private investors. Plans for the project were dropped in 2009 in favor of more incremental road projects.\n\nPerry has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association. He possesses a Concealed Carry License (CCL) and has signed a number of bills that increased CHL access.\n\nDuring a large surge in illegal immigration through the U.S. southern border in the summer of 2014, Perry criticized U.S. President Barack Obama, saying that the surge was \"a humanitarian crisis that he has the ability to stop.\" On July 21, 2014, Perry announced he would send in 1,000 National Guard troops to secure the border. Although illegal immigration levels declined over 70% after Perry deployed the National Guard, PolitiFact.com rated his claim that the decline resulted from the surge as \"mostly false.\"\n\nOn August 15, 2014, Perry was indicted by a Travis County grand jury. The first charge of the indictment was abuse of official capacity, which has since been ruled unconstitutional, for threatening to veto $7.5 million in funding for the Public Integrity Unit, a state public corruption prosecutors department. The second charge, which has also since been ruled unconstitutional, was coercion of a public servant, for seeking the resignation of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, after she was convicted of drunk driving, and incarcerated.\n\nPerry pleaded not guilty to both charges. Perry's supporters called the charges political and partisan, and several Democratic commentators, including David Axelrod, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait stated they believed the charges were either weak or unwarranted.\n\nIn February 2016, Perry was cleared of all charges. \n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that courts could not limit veto power and that prosecuting Perry over his action violates \"the separation of powers provision of the Texas Constitution\" and infringed on Perry's First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\n\nBy the end of his third full term, he had served more than 14 consecutive years in office. A University of Texas at Austin–\"Texas Tribune\" poll released in June 2013, showed Perry leading potential primary challenger Attorney General Greg Abbott by double digits, 45–19%. In February, the same poll had Perry leading by a 3-to-1 margin (49–17%) of 32 points over Abbott.\n\nHowever, Perry decided not to run for re-election to a fourth full term, announcing in front of family and supporters at the Holt Cat headquarters in San Antonio on July 8, 2013 that he would retire instead.\n\nPerry retired with the 10th longest gubernatorial tenure in United States history at the end of his term on January 20, 2015 at days as well as the record of the longest serving Texas Governor.\n\nPerry was considered as a potential candidate since as early as the 2008 presidential election, initially denying he was interested in the office but later becoming more open-minded. He formally launched his campaign on August 13, 2011, in Charleston, South Carolina. \n\nWhile he was initially successful in fundraising and was briefly considered a serious contender for the nomination, he struggled during the debates and his poll numbers began to decline. After finishing fifth with just over 10% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses on January 3, 2012, Perry considered dropping out of the presidential race but did not. After a poor showing in New Hampshire and with \"lagging\" poll numbers in South Carolina, Perry formally announced he was suspending his campaign on January 19, 2012.\n\nAlmost immediately following the 2012 election, Perry was mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidency in the 2016 presidential election, with a \"Time\" magazine article in July 2013 saying that \"everything is aligned for Rick Perry to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016.\"\n\nPerry officially launched his 2016 presidential candidacy on June 4, 2015, in Addison, Texas. A version of the Colt Ford song \"Answer To No One\" boomed from loudspeakers, as Perry took to the stage. He then announced his candidacy at the scheduled press conference.\n\nPerry withdrew on September 11, 2015—becoming the first in the field of major candidates to drop out—following poor polling after the first debate. In the weeks before he dropped out of the race, Perry's campaign was in dire financial straits, spending nearly four times as much as it raised.\n\nOn January 25, 2016, Perry endorsed United States Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) for president. On May 5, 2016, following the suspension of Cruz's presidential campaign, Perry endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency.\n\nOn December 12, 2016, multiple sources reported that Perry would be nominated by Trump to serve as Secretary of the United States Department of Energy. On December 14, 2016, it was officially announced that Perry would be nominated as Secretary of Energy by President-elect Donald Trump. He was heavily criticized when he was first nominated because, during a previous presidential campaign, Perry (after briefly forgetting which of the three departments he wanted to eliminate) said he intended to abolish the department. His nomination was approved by a 16–7 vote from the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on January 31, 2017.\n\nOn March 2, 2017, Perry was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 62–37 vote.\n\nIn April 2017, Perry ordered a study of the U.S. electric grid with particular consideration to coal power.\n\nIn a CNBC interview on June 19, 2017, he downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise of the Earth’s temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change.\n\nIn November 2017, Perry suggested that using fossil fuels to light dangerous places in Africa could reduce sexual assault, saying, \"When the lights are on, when you have light that shines the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts.\" Perry was criticized by the Sierra Club for \"exploiting the struggle of those most affected by climate change.\"\n\nPerry was mentioned as a possible challenger, in 2018, to U.S. Senator and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, whom Perry had initially endorsed after suspending his own campaign. Speculation about Cruz being challenged in the Republican primary arose in the wake of the 2016 Republican National Convention, when Cruz controversially refused to endorse Donald Trump, the eventual Republican presidential nominee, whom Perry had endorsed after Cruz suspended his campaign.\n\nIn a poll conducted from August 12 to 14 of that year by \"Public Policy Polling\", Perry had a 46%–37% lead over Cruz. Later that month, Trump stated that he had \"been hearing a lot about that, and I don’t know if he wants to do it, but boy, will he do well. People love him in Texas, and he was one great governor.\"\n\nOn February 2015, Perry announced that he would join the board of directors of Energy Transfer Partners, which owns and operates one of the largest energy asset portfolios in the United States, and Sunoco Partners, another major Dallas energy company. According to SEC filings, Perry resigned from the boards of both companies on December 31, 2016.\n\nOn August 30, 2016, Perry was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 23 of \"Dancing with the Stars\". He was partnered with professional dancer Emma Slater. Perry and Slater were eliminated on the third week of competition and finished in 12th place.\n\nPerry has written two books:\n\nHe has given a number of speeches, including one at the Heritage Foundation on his views of the proper role of the federal government and the military in disaster management.\n\nIn 1982, Perry married Mary Anita Thigpen, his childhood sweetheart whom he had known since elementary school. They have two adult children, Griffin and Sydney. Anita attended West Texas State University and earned a degree in nursing. She has spearheaded a number of health-related initiatives such as the Anita Thigpen Perry Endowment at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, which focuses on nutrition, cardiovascular disease, health education, and early childhood development. She helped develop and host the Texas Conference for Women.\n\nPerry played himself in minor roles for several feature films, including \"Man of the House\", \"Deep in the Heart\", and \"Hating Breitbart\".\n\nIn 2001, the American Cowboy Culture Association, based in Lubbock, handed Perry its \"The Top Cowboy of Texas\" award. In accepting the honor, Perry cited the importance of his father, Ray Perry, and a former neighbor in Haskell County, the late Watt R. Matthews (born 1899), who Perry said taught him \"not only about Texas and [its] history... but also about the importance of the values that we learned growing up in a rural environment\".\n\nPerry is a member of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and was awarded its Gold Good Citizenship Medal.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the Political Editor of ITV News and host of the weekly political discussion show \"Peston\" (previously \"Peston on Sunday\"). From February 2006 until March 2014, he was the Business Editor for BBC News and Economics Editor from March 2014 to November 2015. He became known to a wider public with his reporting of the late-2000s financial crisis, especially with his scoop on the Northern Rock crisis.\n\nPeston is from a Jewish family and is the son of the late Lord Peston, an economist and Labour life peer, and Helen Conroy. As the son of a life baron, he is entitled to the courtesy title \"The Honourable\", but does not use it. Peston attended Highgate Wood Secondary School, in Crouch End, North London, graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, and then studied at the Université Libre de Bruxelles.\n\nPeston briefly worked as a stockbroker at Williams de Broë, becoming a journalist in 1983 at the \"Investors Chronicle\" and joining \"The Independent\" newspaper on its launch in 1986. From 1989 to 1990, Peston worked for the short-lived \"Sunday Correspondent\" newspaper as Deputy City Editor, before being appointed City Editor of the \"Independent on Sunday\" in 1990.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2000, he worked for the \"Financial Times\". At the \"FT\", he was – at various times – Political Editor, Banking Editor and head of an investigations unit (which he founded). During his time as Political Editor, he memorably fell out with the then Downing Street Press Secretary Alastair Campbell, who regularly mimicked Peston's habit of flicking back his hair, and once responded to a difficult question with the words: \"Another question from the Peston school of smartarse journalism.\" He became close friends with fellow journalist, now PR man, Roland Rudd, where the two were known as the \"Pest and the Rat\". His last position at the \"FT\" was Financial Editor (in charge of business and financial coverage).\n\nIn 2000, he became editorial director of the online financial analysis service Quest, owned by the financial firm Collins Stewart. At the same time, he became a contributing editor of \"The Spectator\" and a weekly columnist for \"The Daily Telegraph\". In 2001, he switched allegiance from the \"Telegraph\" to the \"Sunday Times\", where he wrote a weekly business profile, Peston's People, and left \"The Spectator\" for the \"New Statesman,\" where he wrote a weekly column. In 2002, he joined \"The Sunday Telegraph\" as City editor and assistant editor. He became associate editor in 2005.\n\nIn late 2005, it was announced that Peston would succeed Jeff Randall as BBC Business Editor, responsible for business and City coverage on the corporation's flagship TV and radio news programmes, the BBC News Channel, its website and on Radio 4's \"Today\".\n\nWhile no impropriety on the part of Peston was implied, it was claimed in \"The Observer\" on 19 October 2008, that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) could enquire into the source of one of Peston's scoops which, in September 2008, in the fraught atmosphere of the global financial crisis, revealed that merger talks between HBOS and Lloyds TSB were at an advanced stage. In the minutes before the broadcast, buyers purchased millions of HBOS shares at the deflated price of 96p; in the hour following it, they could be sold for 215p. The Conservative MP Greg Hands had written to the SFO about this.\n\nOn 4 February 2009, Peston appeared as a witness at the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, along with Alex Brummer (City Editor, \"Daily Mail\"), Lionel Barber (editor of the \"Financial Times\"), Sir Simon Jenkins (\"The Guardian\") and Sky News Business Editor Jeff Randall to answer questions on the role of the media in financial stability and \"whether financial journalists should operate under any form of reporting restrictions during banking crises.\"\n\nOn 28 August 2009, Peston had a highly publicised row with James Murdoch, following the latter's MacTaggart lecture. More recently, he has repeatedly broken stories relating to News International's involvement with phone hacking at times which were perceived as advantageous to the company, leading to criticisms that he has become a Murdoch stooge.\n\nPeston is the founder of Speakers for Schools, a pro-bono education venture which organises speakers from the worlds of business, politics, media, the arts, science, engineering and sports to give talks for free in state schools.\n\nOn 17 October 2013, Peston was appointed Economics Editor of BBC News, replacing Stephanie Flanders who was appointed as Chief Market Strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. He continued as Business Editor, as well until his replacement Kamal Ahmed took over the post on 24 March 2014.\n\nOn 4 October 2015, it was announced that Peston would leave the BBC to join ITV News as their Political Editor, replacing Tom Bradby who became the main presenter of \"News at Ten\". Peston made his last appearance on BBC News on 25 November 2015, and his first appearance on ITV's \"News at Ten\" on 11 January 2016. He had a significant scoop in April 2016, when Prime Minister David Cameron stated in an interview he had profited from his father's offshore Blairmore Holdings trust, after information about the trust had been disclosed in the Panama Papers release.\n\nHe presents ITV's new weekly political discussion show, \"Peston on Sunday\", which started on 8 May 2016. In 2018, the programme moved to a Wednesday night timeslot, rebranded to \"Peston\".\n\nPeston has won the Harold Wincott Senior Financial Journalist of the Year Award (2005), the London Press Club's Scoop of the Year Award (2005), Granada Television's \"What the Papers Say\" award for Investigative Journalist of the Year (1994) and the Wincott Young Financial Journalist of the Year (1986).\n\nAt the Royal Television Society's Television Journalism Awards 2008/09 Peston won both \"Specialist Journalist of the Year\" and \"Television Journalist of the Year\" for his coverage of the credit crunch and a string of 'scoops' associated with it. Also, his scoop on Lloyds TSB's takeover of HBOS won the Royal Television Society's \"Scoop of the Year\" award. He was voted Best Performer in a Non-Acting Role in the Broadcasting Press Guild's 2009 awards and Business Journalist of the Year in the London Press Club's 2009 awards. In the 2008 Wincott Awards, he won the Broadcaster of the Year Award and he won the online award for his blog.\n\nIn 2009, he was named Political Journalist of the Year in the Political Studies Association Awards, and he topped polls of the general public and journalists carried out by \"Press Gazette\" to find the highest rated finance and business journalist.\n\nPeston's scoop on Northern Rock seeking emergency financial help from the Bank of England won the Royal Television Society's Television Journalism Award for Scoop of the Year in the 2007/8 awards and the Wincott Award for Business News/Current Affairs Programme of the Year. He was Journalist of the Year in the Business Journalism of the Year Awards for 2007/08, and also won in the Scoop category.\n\nPeston won the Work Foundation's Broadcast News Journalism Award and the Foundation's Radio Programme of the Year Award (for his \"File on 4\", \"The Inside Story of Northern Rock\"). His blog won the digital media category in the Private Equity and Venture Capital Journalist of the Year Awards.\n\nPeston received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2010. In 2011, he was honoured as a Fellow of Aberystwyth University in recognition of \"his success in journalism, his insightful writing and his contribution to the local community\".\n\nPeston's delivery on radio and television news has attracted comment. Richard Wenner complained of it being that of a \"verbal slug – leaving a trail of audio slime\". Tim Teeman in \"The Times\" described his \"intonation\" as \"raggedy [and] querulous\" in 2008, and Ann Treneman described Peston as \"excruciatingly hard to listen to\" in 2009. \"The Daily Telegraph\" identifies \"strangulated diction\" and \"repetition of small words\" among his traits; in the same article, maintaining he is \"loads better than [he] was\", Peston himself conceded he is \"still not as polished as some\". His characteristic mannerisms have been observed by impressionist Rory Bremner. Peston has stated \"I am not going to endeavour to become somebody hugely smooth and polished.\"\n\nPeston published his biography of Gordon Brown, \"Brown's Britain\", in January 2005. It details the rivalry between Brown and the then Prime Minister Tony Blair. \"Brown's Britain\" was described by Sir Howard Davies, former director of the London School of Economics, as \"a book of unusual political significance\". The cover of the book describes how \"Peston was given unprecedented access to Gordon Brown and his friends and colleagues.\" Having told Brown's side of the Blair/Brown power struggle, it is believed that Peston used the relationship then built up with Brown for many of his later financial news story \"scoops\" at the BBC.\n\nIn February 2008, Hodder & Stoughton published Peston's book \"Who Runs Britain? How the Super-Rich are Changing our Lives.\" In \"The Guardian\", Polly Toynbee said of it: \"Reading Peston's book, you can only be flabbergasted all over again at how Labour kowtowed to wealth, glorified the City and put all the nation's economic eggs into one dangerous basket of fizzy finance.\"\n\nIn September 2012, Hodder & Stoughton published \"How Do We Fix This Mess? The Economic Price of Having it All and the Route to Lasting Prosperity\". \"The Observer\" described it as \"A must read...mandatory reading for anyone who wants to have a voice in where we go from here.\"\n\nHis latest book \"WTF\" was published by Hodder & Stoughton in November 2017 and charts the events that led up to the 2016 Brexit referendum. Vernon Bogdanor in the \"Financial Times\" said it was \"a deeply thoughtful analysis that should be mandatory reading for anyone seeking to understand where we have gone wrong.\"\n\nPeston married the writer Siân Busby in 1998, with whom he had a son, Maximilian. Peston and Busby had known each other since their teens, and only rekindled their relationship after her friend, Peston's sister Juliet, was hospitalised after a road accident. In the meantime, Busby had married and been divorced from the Dutch film maker Kees Ryninks, with whom she also had a son, Simon. Busby died in September 2012 from lung cancer, after a long illness.\n\nHe lives in Muswell Hill, north London. After a domestic burglary in December 2012, Peston made an appeal for the return of rings that had belonged to his late wife. Peston said: \"It's an incredibly distressing time, especially so soon after losing Siân. It's not about the monetary value, it's about the sentimental value. The rings are irreplaceable and they mean a lot to me.\"\n\nIn September 2018, as part of an interview with \" The Sunday Times Magazine\", Peston described feeling \"desperately guilty\" after falling in love with another woman several years after his wife's death. Peston said that he was now in a relationship with Charlotte Edwardes, the diary editor of London's \"Evening Standard\". They met at a Christmas party, and had previously worked together briefly.\n\nHis family is of Jewish descent. Peston has described himself as \"culturally Jewish\". He supports Arsenal.\n\n\n\n"}

Dunn also hosted \"Homewrecker\" and \"Proving Ground\", and appeared in the feature films \"Blonde Ambition\" and \"Street Dreams\", as well as in Margera's films \"\" and \"\". Dunn died in a car crash in 2011.\n\nDunn took part in the characteristic stunts that made \"Jackass\" famous, and featured in three released films, \"\", \"Jackass Number Two\" and \"Jackass 3D\".\n\nIn 2006, Dunn and Bam Margera participated in the Gumball 3000 road rally in Margera's Lamborghini Gallardo. He later went on a tour with Don Vito called \"The Dunn and Vito Rock Tour\" for which the DVD was released on March 20, 2007. Dunn and Margera again participated in the rally in 2008.\n\nBam Margera stated during a December 2, 2008, radio interview with \"Big O and Dukes\" of 106.7 WJFK-FM, that he and Dunn would be going to Italy to film \"Where the F*%# Are My Ancestors\". That same month, Dunn appeared on the episode \"\" of \"\" in December 2008. He is also featured in a movie called \"Street Dreams\" which was released in spring 2009. He co-starred along with Rob Dyrdek and Paul Rodriguez Jr. Dunn was also featured on a show with fellow \"Jackass\" star Bam Margera about them traveling through Europe in a \"Viva la Bam\"-like show called \"Bam's World Domination\" for Spike. He appeared in \"Jackass 3D\", which was released on October 15, 2010.\n\nDunn co-hosted G4's \"Proving Ground\" along with Jessica Chobot, which made its premiere on June 14, 2011, six days before his death. However, according to a G4 spokesperson, the channel decided to postpone the airing of further episodes. The spokesperson added, \"The show is off the schedule as of today until we discuss next steps.\" On June 27, G4 announced they would air the remaining episodes starting on July 19, 2011. At the time of his death, Dunn was working on the film \"Welcome to the Bates Motel\". The film was later renamed \"The Bates Haunting\" and was released in 2013.\n\nDunn was born in Medina, Ohio and spent much of his childhood in Brecksville, Ohio. From 2002 to his death, Dunn was in a long-term relationship with Angie Cuturic, who had a part in Margera's directorial debut \"Haggard: The Movie\" and later \"Minghags\". Dunn had several tattoos of Cuturic, including in his inner arm and left ring finger.\n\nDuring shooting of the closing scenes for \"Jackass Number Two\" in 2006, Dunn injured his shoulder during one of his final bits, where he and co-star Bam Margera are pulled out of shot by a running horse by a rope tied around their feet. Dunn dropped straight onto his shoulder, causing damage to the muscles and leading to a blood clot that was at one point life-threatening, due to its proximity to his heart and brain. While seeking treatment for it and Lyme disease, Dunn became depressed, eventually cutting off all contact with his friends, co-workers, and others for nearly two years, and did not participate in \"\", or any subsequent events related to the films and series. He eventually returned to the Jackass cast in the production of \"Jackass 3D\" and \"Jackass 3.5\" later saying that he was happy to rejoin the cast and had more enjoyment working on \"Jackass 3D\" than any previous film endeavors.\n\nOn June 20, 2011, at around 3:30 a.m. EDT, Dunn and Zachary Hartwell, a production assistant on \"Jackass Number Two\", were killed when Dunn's Porsche 911 GT3 veered off the road, struck a tree, and burst into flames in West Goshen Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Dunn had turned 34 nine days prior. He was buried at Highland Drive Cemetery, Brecksville, Ohio.\n\nHours before the crash, Dunn had posted a photo to his Twitter account of himself and Hartwell drinking at a West Chester bar. Dunn was identified in the police report as the vehicle's driver, and a subsequent toxicology report showed Dunn had a blood alcohol level of 0.196 g/dL – more than twice the state's maximum legal limit of 0.08%. The police report stated \"speed may have been a contributing factor in the crash\" and preliminary investigations suggested the car had been traveling between in a zone.\n\nIn August 2012, the parents of Zachary Hartwell filed a civil suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, naming the co-administrators of Dunn's estate as defendants, along with Barnaby's West Chester, the Pennsylvania bar where Dunn drank prior to the fatal crash. The suit claims negligence and recklessness, as well as wrongful death in the incident that killed 30-year-old Hartwell.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that Dunn displayed negligence and recklessness in failing to have his vehicle under adequate and proper control, operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol, operating his vehicle at an excessive speed and violently veering off a road and into a tree, among other alleged transgressions. They are seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, as well as interest, court costs and \"delay damages as the law may allow.\"\n\nDunn is remembered by friends and fans alike as the \"go-to guy for outrageous stunts that even such stalwarts as Steve-O weren't willing to try\" and \"the kind of guy who would do anything for a friend,\" gaining the nickname \"Random Hero\".\n\nFollowing the news of his death, Dickhouse Productions and the producers of the show released the following statement:\n\nI don't really know what to say right now everybody, because the sadness is overwhelming, but today we lost one of our own. Our brother Ryan Dunn has passed. He died in a car wreck in West Goshen, Pennsylvania this morning at 3 a.m.\n\nMany celebrities expressed their grief and condolences on Twitter including Sofia Coppola, Tom Green, Carey Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Tony Hawk and his \"Jackass\" cast members.\n\nKings of Leon also paid homage to Dunn at their London Hyde Park concert by dedicating their song \"McFearless\" to him.

In December 2008, he suffered a brain injury which has left him with profound retrograde amnesia. Scott, along with Joan Bolzan and Caitlin Rother, have written a book titled \"My Life: Deleted\", which was published by Harper Collins and was released on October 4, 2011. \"My Life: Deleted\" appeared on The New York Times Best Seller List on October 8 at #16 for ebooks non-fiction and #29 for combined hardcover and ebooks non-fiction.\n\nScott Bolzan was born to Louis and Alice Bolzan in 1962. He grew up in Chicago, Illinois where he attended Northern Illinois University from 1980 to 1984 on a full athletic scholarship. It was there that he met his wife, Joan, whom he married in 1984.\n\nIn college, Bolzan played football for the Northern Illinois Huskies. After graduating, he went on to play professionally, though his career lasted only two years.\n\nBolzan was drafted in May 1984 by the New England Patriots in the 9th round. He was waived by the Patriots in August of that year.\n\nHe went on to play for the Memphis Showboats in the USFL in 1985.\n\nBolzan was then picked up by the Cleveland Browns in May 1985 and later waived in September 1985. He was re-signed later in the month and cut in October. Bolzan was signed by the Browns again in May 1986. He was injured in August 1986 and retired soon after.\n\nAfter his football career ended due to an injury, Bolzan entered the financial services field where he owned his own financial planning firm specializing in insurance and investments. After moving to Arizona in 1993, he took up aviation, and later developed West Jet Aircraft—a charter company specializing in the charter of Lear Jets and King Airs in the Scottsdale area of Arizona. West Jet grew to become the Number 1 Charter Operator in Arizona according to \"Arizona Ranking Magazine\" in 2007. He sold West Jet aircraft in February 2008 and opened the doors of Legendary Jets shortly after, where he is the CEO/Founder specializing in private jet management.\n\nOn December 17, 2008, Scott Bolzan slipped in the men's bathroom at his place of work. He says his last \"actual memory\" was \"my feet going above my head\". The fall caused a severe concussion. Bolzan was initially told his memory loss was normal and temporary, but as months passed by and he still did not remember any part of his life before the fall, he revealed his condition to his wife and they sought help from neurologists.\n\nA SPECT scan of Bolzan's brain showed that he had no blood flow to his right temporal lobe—the part of the brain that stores long-term memory. Blood flow to the front of his brain on both sides is also dramatically reduced. He suffered brain atrophy, which killed brain cells and damaged connections between them. The loss of blood flow caused Bolzan to suffer an unusually severe case of retrograde amnesia. Dr. Teresa Lanier, Bolzan's primary physician, has said \"It would basically have to be a miracle for him to one day wake up and have complete and intact memory of everything he has lost. That's probably just never going to happen.\"\n\nBolzan's wife has tried to help him remember parts of his life since his fall, showing him photographs of key events in his life in hopes of jogging his memory. Along with memories of his personal life, he has lost memories of historical events and basic interpersonal relationship concepts. He did not understand birthdays or the relationship between a husband and wife. He had no reference points. He did, however, remember basic life tasks, like using eating utensils and how to drive a car.\n\nScott has appeared on talk shows such as Dr. Phil, The View, Fox and Friends, Good Morning America, The Huckabee Show, The Doctors, Nightline, guest appearance on Couples Therapy. Scott has also been a guest on numerous syndicated radio shows and local news stations.\n\nThe New York Post published an article on October 9, 2011 reporting that a doctor who examined Bolzan after his fall stated that Bolzan was possibly \"feigning his alleged memory deficits\", explaining that it is questionable that an injury to one part of the brain could affect all the different memories distributed among the organ, while not damaging his cognitive abilities or his ability to form new memories. The article also cited other neurologists who, while having not examined Bolzan, stated that his amnesia violates fundamental knowledge of neurobiology, in that old memories are more resistant to brain damage than recent ones, in contrast to Bolzan's case.\n\n"}

The term refers to an exaggerated or caricatured portrayal of supposed Irish characteristics in speech and behaviour. The stage Irishman was generally \"garrulous, boastful, unreliable, hard-drinking, belligerent (though cowardly) and chronically impecunious.\" This caricature includes many cultural outlets, including the stage, Punch cartoons and English language cliché, such as the terms \"Paddywagon\" and \"hooligan.\" Collectively, this phenomenon is called \"Paddywhackery.\"\n\nThe early stage Irish persona arose in England in the context of the war between the Jacobites and Whig supporters of William of Orange at the end of the 17th century. Later, the stage Irish persona become more comic and less threatening. Irish writers also used the persona in a satirical way.\n\nThe character of Captain Macmorris in Henry V has been claimed to be the first example of the type. His line \"What ish my nation?\" was later appropriated by modern Irish writers, becoming a \"recurrent epigraph\". However, Macmorris is a loyal and valiant supporter of Henry V, quite different from later, generally lower-class, stage Irishmen. \"Ben Johnson's The Irish Masque at Court\" (29 December 1613; printed 1616) is another early example of the conventions.\n\nJames Farewell's poem \"The Irish Hudibras\" (1689) was published in the wake of William's invasion of Ireland to suppress the Jacobite uprising. It is considered to be the principal origin of the stereotype. This takes the form of a parody of book VI of Virgil's Aeneid, in which Aeneas descends into the underworld. In the poem, this is replaced by Fingal in County Dublin, in which Irish costume, behaviour, and speech-patterns are parodied as if they were denizens of Hades. A companion piece, \"Hesperi-Neso-Grapica or A Description of the Western Isle\" by \"W.M.\" was published in 1715. Pamphlets published under the title \"Bog witticisms\" also parodied the supposed illogicality and stupidity of the Irish.\n\nIrish characters appeared in a number of plays during the 18th century. These were not all negative stereotypes. Sometimes the Irishman could be a noble, or at least sympathetic character. In others he could outwit others. Thomas Sheridan's play \"Captain O'Blunder\" is about a naive Irishman who in the end triumphs over his English enemy. Lucius O'Trigger in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" is an excessively quick-tempered individual. The character had to be rewritten because of complaints that it was insultingly anti-Irish. All these characters were from the genteel social classes.\n\nBy the 19th century, the stage Irishman became more of a lower-class stereotype, associated with the emigrations of mid-century. Dion Boucicault's successful plays \"The Colleen Bawn\" (1860) and \"The Shaughraun\" (1874) included several Stage Irish characters.\n\nPatriotic inversions of the stereotype appeared in Ireland and it was commented upon by writers such as George Bernard Shaw in John Bull's Other Island and by John Millington Synge in \"The Playboy of the Western World\". The latter play was condemned by Irish nationalists, including Sinn Féin leader Arthur Griffith, who described the play as \"a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform\", and that it insulted Irish men and women.\n\n"}

A 1989 corporate takeover staged by the Posners led to fraud convictions for Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken levied by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for their role in improperly assisting the Posners in the attempted deal.\n\nPosner was born on January 11, 1943, in Baltimore and joined his father's business acquiring and managing corporations. In 1988, the SEC charged that the Posners had colluded with Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken to conceal their stock purchases during the 1984 Posner-led takeover of the Fischbach Corporation. While Boesky and Milken agreed to plead guilty to felony counts in relation to their activities in the Fischbach case, the Posners were required to relinquish the financial gains they had made in the deal and to relinquish ownership stakes they held in other companies.\n\nPosner sued his father in 1995, claiming that the senior Posner had overpaid himself while operating a firm in which his son had an ownership stake. The settlement amount was determined based on the result of a gold coin flipped in front of the judge. After his father's death in 2002, Steven took over the real estate investments that his father had controlled.\n\nIn 1966, he married Susan Goldman; they had three children: Kelly Posner Gerstenhaber (married to David Gerstenhaber, son of Murray Gerstenhaber); Sean Posner; and Jarrett Posner (married to Elana Waksal, daughter of Samuel D. Waksal). A resident of Miami, Posner died at the age of 67 on November 29, 2010, as a result of an accident in which his boat collided with another boat, killing him and another passenger and leaving a third passenger of the boat severely injured. The crash was described as the result of a mechanical failure in one of the boats as they were traveling next to each other in Biscayne Bay. He was survived by his wife, as well as by a daughter, two sons and five grandchildren.\n\nFamily member, Jillian Posner, has taken over Steven's charity roles and was recently awarded a Proclamation from the City of Miami Beach for her fluent work in philanthropy.\n"}

Until the 1940s, she worked as an ordinary weaver at one of Moscow's textile factories. She had been a minor party worker in Kursk and the Crimea, and was called to Moscow and sent to the Institute of Chemical Technology from where she graduated in 1941 as a chemical engineer.\nFurtseva's party career started under Joseph Stalin. Gradually, she became active in Komsomol affairs and rose to the position of Secretary of the Moscow City Council in 1950. She gave a speech at the 19th Congress of the CPSU in 1952, the last party congress of the Stalin era, where she was also elected a candidate member of the Central Committee of the CPSU. Under Nikita Khrushchev, who sympathized with her, Furtseva was the first secretary of Moscow Committee of the CPSU from 1954 to 1957.\n\nIn 1952, Furtseva attacked the leading filmstar, Boris Babochkin, who was famous since starring as Vasily Chapayev. This time Furtseva saw the actor starring in a stageplay, and was enraged by Babochkin's satirical portrayal of the Soviet communist leadership. Her angry article in the Soviet newspaper Pravda called for censorship of Babochkin, while Furtseva furthered her career in the Soviet elite. Then Furtseva personally ordered that all film studios and drama companies of the USSR should refuse Babochkin any jobs, keeping him unemployed.\n\nIn 1956 she was appointed a Secretary of the Central Committee and was elected a candidate member of Politburo. She became the first woman to join the Politburo the next year. In this capacity, she sided with Khrushchev in de-Stalinization during the Khrushchev's Thaw, and secured the downfall of Vyacheslav Molotov, Georgy Malenkov, and Lazar Kaganovich when they conspired to depose her patron.\n\nDuring that time she fell in love with Nikolay Firyubin, the Soviet ambassador in Yugoslavia. Furtseva scandalized the Soviet elite by her weekend trips abroad in order to meet her lover. As he married her and rose to become the Deputy Foreign Minister, they settled in Moscow, and their relations cooled down somewhat.\n\nDuring the following 14 years, remembered as the Age of Furtseva, she exerted immense influence on Soviet culture, both repressive and beneficent. As she became increasingly interested in manipulating theatre and cinema, many remarkable actors and directors tried to secure her friendship in order to further their own careers. According to the most intimate of her friends (such as the singer Lyudmila Zykina), she also became addicted to alcohol. On 19 June 1974, \"Pravda\" revealed that she had failed to be re-elected to the Supreme Soviet. Two months previous she had been disciplined by the Party for extravagance and fined 40,000 rubles. She died in Moscow a few months later, officially of heart failure. Yet there were rumors that she was implicated in illegal commercial dealings and, wishing to preclude the impending scandal and disgrace, committed suicide. Furtseva is buried at the Novodevichye Cemetery.\n"}
