He became assistant master at the Lycée Charlemagne, and subsequently at the École Normale. In 1812 he gained a prize from the Academy with an essay on Michel de Montaigne. Under the restoration he was appointed, first, assistant professor of modern history, and then professor of French eloquence at the Sorbonne. Here he delivered a series of literary lectures which had an extraordinary effect on his younger contemporaries.\n\nVillemain had the great advantage of coming just before the Romantic movement, of having a wide love of literature without being an extremist. Most of the clever young men of the brilliant generation of 1830 passed under his influence; and, while he pleased the Romanticists by his frank appreciation of the beauties of English, German, Italian, and Spanish poetry, he did not decry the classics—either the classics proper of Greece and Rome or the so-called classics of France.\n\nIn 1819 he published a book on Oliver Cromwell, and two years later he was elected to the Academy. Villemain was appointed by the restoration government \"Chef de l'imprimerie et de la librairie\", a post involving a kind of irregular censorship of the press, and afterwards to the office of master of requests. Before the revolution of July he had been deprived of his office for his liberal tendencies, and was elected deputy for Évreux in July 1830. Under Louis-Philippe he was made a Peer of France in 1832. He was a member of the council of public instruction, and was twice minister of that department, and he also became secretary of the Academy. During the whole of the July monarchy he was one of the chief dispensers of literary patronage in France, but in his later years his reputation declined. He died in Paris.\n\nHis wit was legendary; an anecdote has a fellow professor saying to him \"I have discovered a gallicism in Cicero.\" The professor had been a revolutionary during the revolution, a follower of Napoleon during the Empire and a royalist during the restauration. Villemain answered quickly to him: \"I found one too: «Quantae infidelitates! Quot amicorum fugae!»\"\n\nVillemain's chief work is his \"Cours de la littérature française\" (5 vols., 1828–1829). Among his other works are: \"Tableau de la littérature au Moyen Âge\" (2 vols., 1846); \"Tableau de la littérature au XVIII siècle\" (4 vols., 1864); \"Souvenirs contemporains\" (2 vols., 1856); \"Histoire de Grégoire VII\" (2 vols., 1873; Engl. trans., 1874).\n\nLautréamont assessed him thus: \"Villemain is thirty-four times more intelligent than Eugène Sue and Frédéric Soulié. His preface to the \"Dictionary of the Academy\" will outlive the novels of Walter Scott and Fenimore Cooper, and all the novels conceivable and imaginable.\"\n\nAmong notices on Villemain may be cited that of Louis de Loménie (1841), E. Mirecourt (1858), J.L. Dubut (1875). See also Sainte-Beuve, \"Portraits\" (1841, vol. iii), and \"Causeries du lundi\" (vol. xi, \"Notes et pensées\").\n"}

He died in a plane accident with Gardel when he was at the height of his career.\n\nLe Pera was born in São Paulo, Brazil, the son of Italian immigrants who moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1902. At the beginning of his career, he worked for several Argentinian periodicals as a journalist and theatre critic and in 1928 became involved in the film industry. He worked for Paramount Pictures while living in Paris and in 1932 the studio arranged for him to work with Carlos Gardel, at a time when the company was looking for ways to increase Gardel's international appeal . Le Pera wrote the scripts for a series of films, including \"Melodía de Arrabal\" (1933), \"Cuesta abajo\" (1934), \"El Tango en Broadway\" (1934), \"El día que me quieras\" (1935) and \"Tango Bar\" (1935), and also wrote the lyrics for tangos composed and performed by Gardel in these films.

Previously he served in the government of Egypt as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1991 to 2001. On 8 September 2013, he was elected president of the committee of 50 that will amend the Egyptian constitution.\n\nHe was born on 3 October 1936 in Cairo, Egypt, the son of former parliamentarian Muhammad Moussa. His father also had a son named Pierre during his studies in France in the 1920s. However, Moussa's half-brother Pierre is a French citizen and has no ties to Egypt.\n\nMoussa finished his education after earning a degree in law from Cairo University in 1957.\n\nMoussa then began his diplomatic career between 1958 and 1972 he worked in several missions, including Egypt's Embassy in Switzerland and the Egyptian mission to the United Nations. From 1974 to 1977 he was an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. From 1977 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1990, he was the Director of the Department of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1981 to 1983, Moussa was the Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, then from 1983 to 1986 Ambassador to India. In 1990, he was promoted Permanent Representative of Egypt to the United Nations. He was named Minister of Foreign Affairs by Prime Minister Atef Sedki on 20 May 1991. He was minister until 15 May 2001 when he was elected as Secretary-General of the Arab League.\n\nMoussa has been heavily involved with Egypt's foreign policy since 1958. He was Egypt's ambassador to the United Nations, India, and Switzerland for a total of 21 years. Moussa was among the many Arab and international diplomats who tried to resolve the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). After serving as Egypt's Foreign Minister from 1991 to 2001, he served as the Secretary General of the Arab League. Moussa has been an extremely popular political figure in Egypt due to his criticism of Israeli policies towards Gaza and the West Bank. At the Forum for New Diplomacy in February 2010, Moussa gave a speech in which he criticized the U.S. government's double standard supporting Israel's nuclear weapons policy but not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear energy. He also criticized Western countries, including the U.S., for not recognizing the results of the 2006 Palestinian election that brought Hamas into power. Like Mohamed El-Baradei and the Muslim Brotherhood, he supports opening the Gaza Strip/Egypt border. His criticisms have made Moussa extremely popular.\n\nOn 15 May 2001, Moussa was selected as Secretary-General of the League of Arab States and took office on 1 June 2001. Critics of former-President Hosni Mubarak allege that Moussa's appointment to the office of Secretary-General of the Arab League was motivated by Mubarak's desire to remove him from the public spotlight, and so he would not compete as a candidate in the 2005 presidential elections.\n\nOn 2003, he became a member of the United Nations High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change for International Peace and Security.\n\nOn 2009, he signed a memorandum of understanding with the Holy See and met with Pope Benedict XVI in order to strengthen joint projects and to promote peace and dialogue on a cultural and political level.\n\nOn 13 June 2010, Moussa visited Gaza in a move to pressure Israel to lift its economic blockade over Hamas-ruled Gaza. The visit by Moussa was the first by an official of the Arab League since the election of Hamas in 2007. Immediately after the Gaza flotilla raid, Moussa said the Arab League would go to the UN Security Council to demand the blockade be lifted. On 15 May 2011, Nabil Elaraby was elected as Secretary-General of the Arab League and succeeded Moussa on 1 July 2011.\n\nIn 2004 an online community gathered tens of thousands of signatures petitioning for Moussa to run in the 2005 elections, but there was no response. In a \"Doha Debate\" Forum televised by the BBC in 2006, Moussa was asked about his presidential hopes. Moussa merely replied that he hoped to continue the recent run of successes that have occurred under his leadership at the Arab League until the end of his term.\n\nWhen asked in October 2009 about rumours that he might run for the presidency in 2012, Moussa did not deny his intention to run for office or rule it out, leaving the door open to speculations. He argued that \"It's the right of every citizen that has the capacity and efficiency to aspire to any political office that would allow him to contribute to the service of his nation\". He further stated to the press that the qualities required to be the President of Egypt also apply to Gamal Mubarak, son of Hosni Mubarak. He also expressed appreciation \"for the confidence expressed by many people when they talk about his candidacy for the presidency and that the message reached him\".\n\nMoussa held talks with Mohamed El-Baradei after his return to Egypt. Many speculate that this meeting was held to discuss Constitutional reforms that will allow transparency in the election process as well as lifting restrictions on independent candidates. On 26 January 2011, at the Annual Horasis meeting in Zurich, Moussa shared strong views on the need for economic and political reforms in Egypt, and made it clear that he was considering a run.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, following the announcement by President Hosni Mubarak that he would not stand in the upcoming presidential elections, Moussa told CNN that he would seriously think about standing himself as a candidate in the next few weeks. On the 8 February broadcast of \"Al Jazeera\" English's Empire, well-connected American journalist Seymour Hersh stated that Moussa was considered the U.S.'s favored \"Plan B\" should Mubarak resign, \"whether he knows it or not.\" On 11 February 2011, Al Jazeera English Online read from a Reuters report that stated Moussa was resigning from his position with the Arab League; on the day that President Mubarak resigned the presidency this furthered rumours he might make a strong bid for president when elections are announced in Egypt. On 12 February 2011, the Egyptian daily newspaper \"Alwafd\" reported that a group of Egyptian youth met with Moussa to discuss a possible nomination for the presidential election. Moussa reportedly agreed to the nomination, but stated that he would await the currently proposed constitutional reforms.\n\nAmr Moussa announced that he would be running as a presidential candidate on 1 March 2011.\n\nA poll conducted during the 2011 protests asking \"who do you think should be the next President of Egypt?\" showed Moussa in the lead, with 26% of respondents naming him.\n\nMoussa placed fifth in the election with 11.13% of the first round vote. After the election, he formed the Conference Party with which a number of smaller opposition parties aligned.\n\nAlthough credited with shaking up the Arab League's bureaucracy, Moussa has been criticized by former and current staff members of the Arab League for his management of the organization. In his book, \"The League of the Arab States: what’s left of it\", former Arab League and Syrian diplomat Kawkab Najib El Rayess accused Moussa of favoritism and promoting his loyalists into the high ranks of the Arab League at the expense of the more-qualified diplomats.\n\n\n"}

She has a substantial discography primarily with EMI Classics and Decca and is especially known for her performances in the operas of Puccini.\n\nGheorghiu was born in 1965 in Adjud, Romania. Along with her sister Elena Dan, she sang opera music from an early age. At age 14, Gheorghiu began to study singing at the National University of Music Bucharest, primarily under Mia Barbu. Her graduation in 1990 followed the overthrow of Nicolae Ceaușescu the previous year, enabling her to seek an international career immediately. Her professional opera debut took place at the Cluj-Napoca Romanian National Opera as Mimì in \"La bohème\" in 1990, the same year she won third prize in the Belvedere International Competition.\n\nGheorghiu made her international debut in 1992 at the Royal Opera House as Zerlina in \"Don Giovanni\". She debuted at the Vienna State Opera as Adina in \"L'elisir d'amore\" and at the Metropolitan Opera as Mimì in \"La bohème\". In 1994, she was auditioned by the conductor Sir Georg Solti for a new production of \"La traviata\" at the Royal Opera House. Her debut as Violetta led her to international stardom.\n\nGheorghiu has concentrated her repertoire on several different roles: Violetta, Mimì, Magda, Adina, and Juliette. In 2003, she debuted as Nedda in \"Pagliacci\" and as Marguerite in \"Faust\". A soprano with a large range and a dark coloured voice, Gheorghiu is also able to sing \"spinto\" roles. She has recorded \"Tosca\" (also made into a film in 2001, directed by the French director Benoît Jacquot) and Leonora in \"Il trovatore\" for EMI and sang in her first Tosca at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 2006. Her performance was an overall success, although because the famous Zeffirelli production of 1964 was replaced by a new production (which premiered with her), there was comparison between the Toscas of Gheorghiu and Maria Callas, for whom the Zeffirelli production was designed.\n\nGheorghiu took part in many concerts, singing alone or together with her colleagues. Among the most important ones, the reopening of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden (1999) and Teatro Malibran in Venice (2001) and at the opening the new Opera House in Valencia, in the presence of the Queen Sofia of Spain (2005). She sang at the Prom at the Palace (2002), the event that marked the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, a concert that is available on DVD. In 2012, Gheorghiu was the guest of honor at a London Royal Opera House gala which was also attended by Elizabeth II. The Romanian soprano sang at the event, which was organized to raise funds for the Royal Opera House Foundation. She also sang at the Queen Beatrix's Jubilee Gala in Amsterdam (2005), at the New Year's Eve Concert at Palais Garnier in Paris (2006), at the Met Summer Concert in Prospect Park, New York (2008), and at the Memorial Concert for Luciano Pavarotti in Petra, where she also performed an unconventional duet of \"Là ci darem la mano\" from Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" with Sting (2008).\n\nIn 2009, Gheorghiu was invited to honor Grace Bumbry during the 32nd Annual Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC. She performed \"Vissi d'arte\" from Puccini's \"Tosca\" in the presence of Barack Obama.\n\nIn December 2000, Gheorghiu performed the title role in the film \"Tosca\", directed by Benoit Jacquot, together with Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. One year later, in 2002, Gheorghiu interpreted Juliette in the movie \"Roméo et Juliette\", alongside Roberto Alagna and Tito Beltrán, also released on DVD.\n\nIn November 2010, Gheorghiu made her debut in Francesco Cilea's \"Adriana Lecouvreur\", a new production of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. \"The Observer\" wrote, \"It's hard to imagine anyone bettering Angela Gheorghiu in this part. Her voice, feather-light and creamy yet with a core of steel, matches the liquid way she moves on stage. She's a natural actress and made the improbable death scene heartbreakingly believable and her signature aria 'Poveri fiori' simply unforgettable.\" \"The Telegraph\" wrote, \"\"Adriana\" is known as a nice, easy sing for ageing or challenged prima donnas (no difficult top notes, and a tame orchestra), so Gheorghiu, in her vocal prime, should have found it a doddle. But her first aria was bumpy and nervous, and she fudged the end of the second. Elsewhere, in duet and declamation, she often sang exquisitely.\"\n\nIn July 2011, Gheorghiu sang the title role in \"Tosca\" at the Royal Opera House conducted by Antonio Pappano, and the following September returned there for the revival of \"Faust\", which was broadcast live in cinemas all over the world. In April 2012, she appeared for the first time at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, in a concert of duets with Roberto Alagna.\n\nIn February 2012, Gheorghiu was the special guest at the Vienna Opera Ball, where she performed accompanied by conductor Georges Prêtre and the Vienna State Opera Orchestra.\n\nIn June 2012, Gheorghiu celebrated 20 years since her debut on the stage of the Royal Opera House, London, by performing in \"La bohème\" with Roberto Alagna. In July 2012, she held her first master class at the Georg Solti Accademia in Castiglione della Pescaia, Italy. She returned to Tuscany for a second masterclass at the Georg Solti Accademia in 2016. In November 2012 she returned to San Francisco Opera to perform in Puccini's \"Tosca\". In an interview with \"Kurier\" from February 2014, Gheorghiu expressed interest in performing the role of Norma and in recording the role of Desdemona (Otello). Her most recent role debut was as Charlotte in Massenet's \"Werther\" in March 2015 at the Vienna State Opera, to great critical acclaim. Gheorghiu also performed the role of Charlotte in August 2015 at the Salzburg Festival in a concert version with great success.\n\nIn July 2015, Gheorghiu made her debut at the Verbier Festival in Switzerland with guitarist Miloš Karadaglić in a special recital at The Église.\n\nIn October 2015, Gheorghiu appeared for the first time ever in Australia, performing in two exceptional gala concerts at the Sydney Opera House and at Hammer Hall, Arts Centre Melbourne. In November 2015, Gheorghiu performed at the Richard Tucker Opera Gala, \"opera world’s most highly anticipated event of the season\", at David Geffen Hall, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, in New York City. The gala was broadcast on February 5, 2016 on PBS. Gheorghiu also sang at the Richard Tucker Opera Gala in 1999. In November 2015, Gheorghiu sang at the Elena Obraztsova Opera Ball at Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia. On the 29 November 2015, Gheorghiu held a humanitarian concert at the Romanian Athenaeum to raise funds for the victims of the Colectiv nightclub fire. The concert was organized in partnership with the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir and conductor Tiberiu Soare. In December 2015, Gheorghiu sang together with Ramón Vargas and Ghiță Petean in a gala concert at Opéra de Monte-Carlo. All proceeds from this concert went to the Foundation established in the disappearance of Ramon Vargas's son, Eduardo, at the age of six (\"Fund in memory of Eduardo Vargas\").\n\nIn 2016, Gheorghiu returned in the title role of Puccini's \"Tosca\" at the Royal Opera House and received great critical acclaim. Gheorghiu was scheduled to appear in 5 performances, but sang in a total of 7 performances. She also returned as Tosca at the Wiener Staatsoper alongside Jonas Kaufmann and Bryn Terfel in April 2016. In September 2016, Gheorghiu performed in \"Tosca\" at the Staatsoper Berlin with \"loud and prolonged ovation\".\n\n2017 marks 25 years since Gheorghiu's international debut at the Royal Opera House in 1992. She performed there in \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" in February 2017. In October of that year she made her house debut at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, again as Adriana Lecouvrer.\n\nGheorghiu has recorded many recital albums and complete opera recordings and often appears on television and in concerts. Although Gheorghiu has not won an individual Grammy award, the EMI recording of Jules Massenet's \"Manon\" with Gheorghiu in the title role won the 2001 Gramophone Award for \"Best Opera Recording\" and was nominated for \"Best Opera Recording\" in the 2002 Grammy Awards. The EMI recording of \"Tosca\" with Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi in the title roles brought her the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis award in 2002.\n\nGheorghiu has won 5 Gramophone Awards, most recently for Madama Butterfly in 2009. She has also won \"Gramophone Awards\" in 1997 for Puccini's La rondine (Record of the Year), in 2000 for her album \"Verdi Heroines\" (Decca): Best Recital and Classic fM People's Choice Award in 2000 and 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Gheorghiu won the Echo Klassik Award for \"Female Singer of the Year\".\n\nShe also won Diapason d'Or Awards, Choc du Monde de la Musique in France, Cecilia Prize in Belgium, the Italian Musica e dischi, Foreign Lyric Production Award, the United States Critics' Award.\n\nGheorghiu won the title of Female Artist of the Year at the Classic Brit Awards in 2001 and 2010.\n\nIn 2004, Gheorghiu won the Victoires de la musique classique award for the best opera recording for Bizet's Carmen (EMI Classics).\n\nShe was honoured with \"La Medaille Vermeille de la Ville de Paris\" and she was appointed an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture and by her native country Romania.\n\nIn December 2010, Gheorghiu was named Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Arts in Iași (Romania) and the Star of Romania, the highest decoration given by the President of Romania.\n\nIn October 2012, Gheorghiu received the Nihil Sine Deo royal decoration from King Michael I, honoring her contribution to promoting Romanian culture in the world.\n\nIn 2013, the DVD of Adriana Lecouvreur released by Decca where Gheorghiu plays the title role won at the International Classical Music Awards for Best DVD Performance.\n\nIn October 2014, Gheorghiu received the honorary title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca.\nIn 2014, Gheorghiu was included in the Gramophone Hall of Fame that celebrates the men and women whose contributions to classical music recording have proved the most influential and inspiring.\n\nIn October 2015, Gheorghiu was awarded the European Cultural Award in a special gala ceremony in Dresden, Germany\n\nOn occasion, Gheorghiu has had difficult relationships with opera house managements and directors. Some, but not all, of them have stemmed from her opposition to directors who, as she put it in an interview with \"ABC\" \"want to express their own fantasies, forgetting about the characters. At times, she says, what they put on stage goes against both the story and the music.\" She has attributed her outspokenness to her upbringing in Romania under the totalitarian regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu:\n\"Because I grew up in a country where there was no possibility of having an opinion, it makes me stronger now. Lots of singers are frightened about not getting invited back to an opera house if they speak out. But I have the courage to be, in a way, revolutionary. I want to fight for opera, for it to be taken seriously. Pop music is for the body, but opera is for the soul.\"\n\nGheorghiu had a problematic relationship with former Metropolitan Opera General Manager Joseph Volpe after her debut there as Mimì in 1993. In 1996, Gheorghiu was cast as Micaela in a new production of Bizet's \"Carmen\", opposite Waltraud Meier and Plácido Domingo. The production by Franco Zeffirelli called for Micaela to wear a blonde wig, which Gheorghiu disliked. When the Met toured the production in Japan in 1997, she refused to wear it on the first night to which Volpe famously declared, \"The wig is going on, with you or without you\" and replaced her with an understudy.\n\nShe appeared at the Met again in 1998 for six performances of Gounod's \"Roméo et Juliette\" with her husband, tenor Roberto Alagna as Roméo. Volpe had planned to engage Gheorghiu in Violetta Valery for a new production of \"La traviata\", to premiere in November 1998 and directed by Zeffirelli. Alagna was to sing the role of Violetta's lover, Alfredo Germont. According to Volpe, Gheorghiu and Alagna argued with the staff and the director over production details and continually delayed signing the contract. They eventually signed their contracts, and faxed them to the Met one day past their deadline. Volpe refused to accept them. The production opened with Patricia Racette and Marcelo Álvarez as the lovers.\n\nDespite these issues, Gheorghiu and Alagna returned to the Metropolitan Opera for five performances of Donizetti's \"L'elisir d'amore\" in 1999 and for four performances of \"Faust\" in 2003. Gheorghiu also performed at the Met as Liù in Puccini's \"Turandot\" in 2000; as Violetta in \"La traviata\" opposite Jonas Kaufmann in 2006 and 2007; as Amelia in Verdi's \"Simon Boccanegra\" in 2007; as Mimì in \"La bohème\" in 2008; as Magda in the 2008/2009 season in the ROH/SFO production of \"La rondine\", the Met's first performance of the opera since 1936; and for the 2009/2010 season she appeared as Violetta, replacing her previous engagement as Marie Antoinette in a rare revival of John Corigliano's \"The Ghosts of Versailles\", which was replaced due to the recession.\n\nIn September 2007, Gheorghiu was dismissed from Lyric Opera of Chicago's production of \"La bohème\" by General Manager William Mason, for missing rehearsals and costume fittings, and generally \"unprofessional\" behavior. Gheorghiu said in a statement that she had missed some rehearsals to spend time with her husband, who was singing at the Met in \"Roméo et Juliette\" and rehearsing for Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" and added, \"I have sung \"Bohème\" hundreds of times, and thought missing a few rehearsals wouldn't be a tragedy. It was impossible to do the costume fitting at the same time I was in New York.\n\nSix weeks later, Gheorghiu made her debut at San Francisco Opera receiving favorable reviews for her Magda in that company's new production of \"La rondine\". The San Francisco Opera production originated with London's Royal Opera House, where it premiered on May 7, 2002 with Gheorghiu and Alagna as Magda and her lover Ruggero. It is one which she particularly admires: \"When the curtain opened on \"La rondine\" at Covent Garden, the audience gasped and applauded. People want to dream. If directors want to do something new with operas, why not do something beautiful?\"\n\nOn December 31, 2008, Gheorghiu premiered the new production of \"La rondine\" at the Metropolitan Opera, together with Roberto Alagna, Marius Brenciu, Lisette Oropesa and Samuel Ramey. The opera was last performed at the house over 70 years ago. She received some favorable reviews for her Magda: \"Gheorghiu embodies the part, as actress and singer, with her natural charisma.\" The \"New York Times\" opinion was more mixed: \"Vocally, both leads are somewhat disappointing. Ms. Gheorghiu, as Magda, sings with gleaming sound and wonderfully dusky colorings in the strong top register of her voice. But the earthy richness of her mid-range singing sometimes turns breathy, and her low voice is curiously weak.\"\n\nIn August 2009, Gheorghiu canceled all her scheduled 2010 Met performances of \"Carmen\", for \"personal reasons\". It was to have been her first public performance of the title role (written for and normally sung by a mezzo-soprano). This was later attributed to her separation from her husband, Roberto Alagna, who was scheduled to sing opposite her. She also cancelled other Met performances scheduled near the end of 2010. In March 2011 she cancelled all her scheduled performances of Gounod's \"Roméo et Juliette\" at the Met, citing illness. Only days later she cancelled all her performances in the scheduled new production of \"Faust\" during the Met's 2011/2012 season. According to her manager, \"She felt uncomfortable in the concept\". Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said that her frequent cancellations had become \"an increasingly difficult problem for (the Met).\" Gelb went on to say that, as of then, plans were still in place for Gheorghiu's return to the Met stage. He also said, \"This has nothing to do with wigs.\".\n\nGheorghiu returned to the Met in December 2014 to perform to great critical acclaim as Mimì in \"La bohème\", opposite Michael Fabiano.\n\nGheorghiu performed her first Met \"Tosca\" in the Luc Bondy production in the 2015/16 season with great reviews: \"the famous \"Vissi d'arte\" was easily the most poignant moment of the night from every angle...At the climax of the aria, her voice soared through the theater in painful anguish and her final notes were held out with seemingly endless breath\"; \"The color of her voice is gorgeous—her tone is smooth and full, mellow but with a hint of lemon\"; \"Her idiosyncratically alluring, sometimes maddening, always fascinating Floria Tosca inevitably became the evening’s unmissable raison d'être!\".\n\nDivorced from her first husband, Romanian engineer Andrei Gheorghiu, from whom she retained her surname, Gheorghiu married tenor Roberto Alagna in 1996. The couple have sung together often on stage and on studio recordings. She was once chosen the 74th \"sexiest woman in the world\" by the magazine \"FHM\". In October 2009, Alagna said in an interview in \"Le Figaro\" that he and Gheorghiu had separated.\n\nFollowing the separation, she declined to appear opposite Alagna in \"Carmen\" at the Metropolitan Opera in December 2009. The divorce, however, was called off in December 2009. In a March 2011 interview with the \"Daily Express\" she stated that she and Alagna were back together, and they were seen together in March 2011 backstage at London's Royal Opera House where Alagna was performing in \"Aida\". She also stated in the interview that although she still wanted to sing separately from her husband for a while, she was looking forward to the day when they could retire together and have their own pets. Later that year, they jointly opened a Greek amphitheatre in the Emirate of Qatar. In June 2012, they sang together in two performances of \"La bohème\" at The Royal Opera House to commemorate the 20 years since they had met in the very same production. They also sang at a joint concert in Buenos Aires, and planned to perform together in \"Manon Lescaut\" and \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" in future seasons. Gheorghiu said of their separation, \"It was stupid of us to be apart.\" However, in January 2013, she announced that they had agreed to divorce.\n\nGheorghiu's younger sister, Elena Dan, died in 1996 in an accident. She commented, \"she was more than a sister to me... She was only a year younger. We were inseparable almost like twins, although she was blonde and green-eyed. She was another me. But, of course, it's worse for my mother. She is really very badly hit.\" Elena Dan had married a doctor, Andrei Dan, and had a daughter called Ioana. After Andrei's death in 2001, Ioana was adopted by Gheorghiu and subsequently became a university student in the UK.\n\n"}

He was baptized with the name of John Baptist Joseph Fabian Sebastian, after the patron saint of the Tuscan capital. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph II as Holy Roman Emperor and his family moved from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to the Imperial court in Vienna. Only two years later, John's elder brother Francis II ascended the Imperial throne.\n\nJohn's native language was Italian, he learned to speak French and German fluently. Educated by the Swiss historian Johannes von Müller, he developed wide-ranging skills and interests, especially in the history and geography of the Alpine countries.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, John was given command of the Austrian army in September 1800, despite his personal reluctance to assume the position. He showed personal bravery in the War of the Second Coalition, but his troops were crushed at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December. Demoralized by defeat, the army nearly disintegrated in the subsequent retreat, which was only stopped by an armistice arranged on 22 December. After the Peace of Lunéville in 1801, Archduke John was made General Director of the Engineering and Fortification Service, and later commander of the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt.\n\nIn the War of the Third Coalition, John again fought the French and Bavarian forces. From 1805 he directed an able defence of several Tyrolean passes against the French and was awarded the Commander Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. However, according to the Peace of Pressburg, Austria had to cede Tyrol and Vorarlberg to Bavaria. John remained obliged to Tyrol and maintained friendly contact with Baron Joseph Hormayr who forged a resistance movement against the Bavarian occupation. In 1808, John pressed for the creation of Tyrolean Landwehr forces based on the success of the Prussian Landwehr, which played a vital role in the Tyrolean Rebellion led by Andreas Hofer.\n\nAt the commencement of the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809 he became commander of the Army of Inner Austria, fighting against the French forces of Eugène de Beauharnais in Italy. Under his command were the VIII Armeekorps led by Albert Gyulai and the IX Armeekorps headed by Albert's brother Ignaz Gyulai. After winning a significant victory at the Battle of Sacile on 16 April 1809, his army advanced almost to Verona. Having detached forces to besiege Venice and other fortresses, John's army was soon outnumbered by Eugène's heavily reinforced host. Worse, news of the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Eckmühl reached him and compelled him to order a retreat. Before withdrawing, he fought off Franco-Italian attacks at the Battle of Caldiero between 27 and 30 April. Attempting to blunt the Franco-Italian pursuit, he stood to fight on 8 May and was beaten at the Battle of Piave River. Trying to defend the entire border, he sent Ignaz Gyulai to defend Ljubljana (Laibach) in Carniola, while holding Villach in Carinthia with his own forces. Eugène's pursuit overran the frontier defenses at the Battle of Tarvis and wrecked a column of hoped-for reinforcements at the Battle of Sankt Michael. Forced to flee northeast into Hungary, John offered battle again but was defeated at Raab on 14 June 1809. Ordered to join his brother Archduke Charles at the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, John's small army arrived too late to avert an Austrian defeat. His brother criticized him for tardiness.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the campaign, John again evolved plans for a widespread rebellion. However, upon the Treaty of Schönbrunn Austrian policies under Minister Klemens von Metternich sought a rapprochement to France. John's friend Baron Hormayr and other conspirators were arrested, the archduke himself effectively was sidelined and retired to his estates in Thernberg.\n\nJohn, tired of warfare, turned away from the military and developed a great interest for nature, technology and agriculture. He collected minerals and was active as an alpinist and hunter in the Duchy of Styria. In his early days Archduke Johann and his brother Louis had the habit of travelling to France, where the latter married Madame de Gueroust. In 1815, on his visit to the United Kingdom, John received a \"Doctor honoris causa\" degree from the University of Edinburgh.\n\nIn the history of Styria, he is remembered as a great modernizer and became an important figure of identification for Styrians. His proximity to the people is given evidence to by his many contacts with the common man, by wearing the local Tracht, the \"Steireranzug\", and by collecting and promoting the material and spiritual culture of the country. \nIn 1811, he founded the Joanneum Museum in Graz and the predecessor of Graz University of Technology. Some other foundations were initiated by him, such as the Styrian State Archive 1817, the \"Steiermärkisch-Ständische Montanlehranstalt\", which was founded in 1840 in Vordernberg and later became the University of Leoben, the Styrian Society for Agriculture 1819, the Mutual Fire Insurance, the Styrian Building Society, the \"Landesoberrealschule\" in 1845 and the Society for Styrian History in 1850. His routing of the Austrian Southern Railway from Vienna to Triest over the Semmering Pass and through the Mura and Mürz valleys to Graz is particularly notable. The inheritance of his maternal uncle Duke Albert Casimir of Teschen enabled him to acquire a tin factory in Krems near Voitsberg and coal mines near Köflach, thereby he also became an industrialist. In 1840, he bought the Stainz dominion, where he was also freely elected as mayor in 1850. He was already the lord of the Brandhof manor in Mariazell.\n\nIn 1829, he married (1804-1885), the daughter of Jakob Plochl, postmaster of Aussee, and his wife Maria Anna Pilz, during a nocturnal ceremony in Brandhof. By this morganatic marriage, John was excluded from succession to the throne. Emperor Francis elevated Anna to a \"Baroness of Brandhofen\" in 1834 and in 1839 she gave birth to a son, Franz, the only child from the marriage. His descendants were styled \"Counts of Meran\" and \"Barons of Brandhofen\", Proprietors of Stainz and Brandhofen.\n\nJohn was also a passionate mountaineer in the Eastern Alps and attempted to be the first to climb the Großvenediger. For that reason, the Erzherzog-Johann-Hütte (\"Adlersruhe\") at the Grossglockner, and the Archduke John's Vanilla Orchid (\"Nigritella rubra\" subsp. \"archiducis-joannis\"), an orchid growing on mountain meadows, are named after him.\n\nEven though Johann did not consider himself a liberal, he promoted some liberal ideas. He was often in conflict with the Habsburg court, especially because of his morganatic marriage, though he never openly rebelled. He had earned great recognition in the Styrian lands, moreover he gained general acceptance by his jovial manners and his marriage with a middle-class woman.\n\nUpon the March Revolution of 1848, the Frankfurt Parliament discussed the appointment of an all-German government replacing the Federal Convention. On a proposal by the liberal politician Heinrich von Gagern, the assembly on 28 June 1848 voted for the establishment of a central authority (\"Provisorische Zentralgewalt\") and on the next day a broad majority elected Archduke John regent of the realm (\"Reichsverweser\").\n\nArchduke John accepted the nomination as head of the short-lived German Empire and on 12 July 1848 the delegates of the Federal Convention, in response to public pressure, ceded their powers to him. On July 15, he appointed the ministers Anton von Schmerling, Johann Gustav Heckscher and Eduard von Peucker to office, completed by Prince Carl of Leiningen as minister president and head of government. Nevertheless, his political office did not offer many opportunities, though all laws had to be signed by him. \n\nFirst attempts by the government to obtain supreme command of the German Federal Army faced entrenched resistance from the member states. To strengthen support, the left-wing politician Robert von Mohl joined the Leiningen Cabinet on August 9. Leiningen himself resigned on September 6, after the Frankfurt assembly rejected to ratify the armistice of Malmö, signed by Prussia during the First Schleswig War. Minister Anton von Schmerling acted as head of government, until from November 1848 the cabinet gradually lost the support of the centrist Casino faction and finally its majority in parliament. Schmerling was forced to resign and on December 17, Archduke John had to appoint Heinrich von Gagern new minister president, though he opposed his 'Lesser German' ideas. \n\nArchduke John did not take part in the draft of the Frankfurt Constitution, which was adopted on 28 March 1849 after lengthy negotiations led by Gagern, and he pronounced against the strong position of Prussia. Determined to resign, he was once more turned over by the ministers. When in April 1849 King Frederick William IV of Prussia disappointed Gagern's hopes and openly rejected the Constitution, Archduke John remained passive and Gagern handed in his resignation on May 10. John insisted that he would exert central authority out of a sense of obligation, nevertheless he departed for a prolonged stay at the health resort of Bad Gastein. After the final failure of the March Revolution, he finally resigned from his office on 20 December 1849.\n\nWhen Archduke Johann came back to Frankfurt on a visit in 1858, he openly regretted the failure of the German unification. He died in 1859 in Graz, where a fountain erected in his honour (\"illustration\") dominates the central square. He is buried in Schenna near Meran. He was the great-grandfather of noted conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1929–2016).\n\n"}
{"id": "741127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=741127", "title": "Basil D'Oliveira", "text": "Basil D'Oliveira\n\nBasil Lewis D'Oliveira CBE OIS (4 October 1931 – 19 November 2011) was an England international cricketer of South African Cape Coloured background, whose potential selection by England for the scheduled 1968–69 tour of apartheid-era South Africa caused the D'Oliveira affair. Nicknamed \"Dolly\", D'Oliveira played county cricket for Worcestershire from 1964 to 1980, and appeared for England in 44 Test matches and four One Day Internationals between 1966 and 1972.\n\nBorn into a religious Catholic family of Indian-Portuguese descent in Signal Hill, Cape Town, as a boy he would make his way down to the Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town, and climb the trees outside to watch the games.\n\nD'Oliveira captained South Africa's national non-white cricket team, and also played football for the non-white national side.\n\nWith the support of John Arlott, and the members and supporters of St Augustine's Cricket Club in Cape Town, he emigrated to England in 1960, where the journalist John Kay found him a place in his Central Lancashire League team of Middleton. D'Oliveira noted his surprise at seeing white people doing menial work, and waiting on him in restaurants. He joined the first-class county team Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 1964, and became a British citizen.\n\nIn 1966 he was selected for the England cricket team as an all-rounder to face the West Indians in the second Test. He made a solid debut, scoring 27 before being run out, and returning bowling figures of 1 for 24 and 1 for 46 in 39 overs. In the third Test he scored 76 and 54, while capturing 2 wickets for 51 and 2 for 77 at Trent Bridge; though the West Indies cantered to a 139-run victory. He contributed a fighting 88 in the fourth Test at Headingley, although England once again lost, by an innings and 55 runs. D'Oliveira was quietly efficient in the final Test as England turned the tables on the West Indies, winning by an innings and 34 runs to lose the series 3-1. Against India he hit 109 in the first Test where England won by six wickets and went on to win the series 3-0. Facing Pakistan he hit fifties in both innings of the first Test, in a series that England won 2-0. He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1967.\n\nNext up was an away series against the West Indies, early in 1968. D'Oliveira didn't turn in his best showing in the five matches, scoring only 137 runs at an average of 27.4. He did a lot of bowling, but picked up only three wickets, even though he was economical. Once back in England, it was time for a five-Test Ashes series. The Aussies crushed England by 159 runs in first Test as England crumbled in their second innings, despite D'Oliveira's top scoring effort of 87 not out. He was then dropped for the subsequent three Tests. He was recalled by the selectors for the final Test at the Oval, and 158 runs in the first innings against Australia seemed to have guaranteed his place in the side to play the 1968–69 Test series in South Africa. He was left out of the touring party under the pretext that his bowling would not be effective in his native country.\n\nHe was selected in June 1969 to face the West Indies, this time in a three-Test series. He followed that with a three-match series against New Zealand and then a seven-Test Ashes series in Australia, in which he scored 369 runs at an average of 36.9, including 117 in the fifth Test at the MCG.\n\nEngland then went to New Zealand for two Tests, with D'Oliveira scoring 100 in the first one and 58 and five in the second. Pakistan next visited England in 1971, and D'Oliveira enjoyed a fine series with the bat, making 241 runs at an average of 60.25. He was below par in the three-Test series against India that followed, but was in better form for the visit of Australia in June 1972.\n\nD'Oliveira completed his career having played 41 Tests. He scored 2484 runs at an average of 40.06, with five centuries and 15 fifties. He also captured 47 wickets at 39.55.\n\nD'Oliveira was a successful batsman with a low backlift and powerful strokes. He was also a tough competitor. When he toured Australia in 1970–71 on the night after they won the series 2–0 he pushed his forefinger into the chest of every Australian he met, saying \"We stuffed you.\"\n\nWanting to play international cricket, D'Oliveira was somewhat cagey about his date of birth. After his death, journalist Pat Murphy with whom he collaborated on his autobiography stated:\n\nSouth African cricket officials in 1968 realised that the inclusion of D'Oliveira in the England squad would lead to the cancellation of the tour, and probable exclusion of South Africa from Test cricket. This exerted pressure on the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) hierarchy leading to the decision not to pick him, which was felt by opponents of apartheid to be a way of keeping cricket links with South Africa open. There was dissent in the press to this course of events and when Warwickshire's Tom Cartwright was ruled out because of injury, D'Oliveira was called up into the squad. South African prime minister B. J. Vorster had already made it clear that D'Oliveira's inclusion was not acceptable, and despite many negotiations the tour was cancelled; South Africa was excluded from Test cricket for 22 years. This was seen as a watershed in the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa.\nThe D'Oliveira Affair had a massive impact in turning international opinion against the apartheid regime in South Africa. It prompted changes in South African sport and eventually in society. The events of 1968 were dramatized on BBC Radio 4 in April 2009 in a play by Christopher Douglas entitled \"Dolly\".\n\nIn 2000, he was nominated as one of 10 South African cricketers of the century, despite not having played for South Africa. In 2004, a perpetual trophy was struck for Test series between England and South Africa, and named the Basil D'Oliveira Trophy. In 2005, he was awarded a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours. In the same year, a stand at New Road, Worcester, was named in his honour.\n\nIn 1980 after the end of his playing career, he wrote an autobiography with the BBC's Pat Murphy, titled \"Time to Declare\". In it, he stated for the first time that he was glad that the proposed South African cricket tour to England in 1970 was called off, for fear of public disturbances. In 2004, journalist Peter Oborne wrote a biography entitled \"Basil D'Oliveira: Cricket and Conspiracy\" (), which was awarded the William Hill Sports Book of the Year and was accompanied by Paul Yule's RTS award-winning documentary \"Not Cricket—The Basil D'Oliveira Conspiracy.\"\n\nHe was married to Naomi, and their son Damian D'Oliveira also played first-class cricket for Worcestershire, while his younger brother Ivan played briefly for Leicestershire. His grandson Brett D'Oliveira is currently contracted with Worcestershire and made his debut for the county in 2011.\n\nD'Oliveira had Parkinson's disease in later life. He died aged 80 in England, on 19 November 2011.\n\nA farewell for D'Oliveira was written on the last 2011 issue of \"Time\" magazine by Trevor Manuel, South Africa's Minister in the Presidency for National Planning. It highlights the personal successes of the cricket player, together with the impact he had on South African sport and society.\n\nIn September 2018 he was posthumously awarded the Freedom of the City of Worcester in recognition of his contribution to the city. The award was accepted by his son Shaun at a ceremony in the Guildhall in Worcester on 14 September 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "224493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224493", "title": "Birla family", "text": "Birla family\n\nThe Birla family is a family connected with the industrial and social history of India.\n\nThe Birla family belongs to the Maheshwari subcaste of the Vaishya (trader) caste, and are Marwari since they hail from the Marwad region of present-day Rajasthan. Specifically, the family originates from the town of Pilani in the Shekhawati region lying between Marwad.\n\nIn Pilani during the early 19th century lived Seth Shobharam, grandson of Seth Bhudharmal, a local tradesman of modest means. It was his son, Seth Shiv Narayana (1840–1909), who first ventured outside Pilani. At this time, Ahmedabad was the railhead which serviced trade from a large region of northwest India. Goods (mainly cotton) would be brought from the hinterland to the city and sent from there by train to Bombay for export to England and other countries. Several cotton ginning units were also set up in Ahmedabad, to clean the cotton before shipment to England. Shiv Narayana Birla was one of the early Indian traders to participate in this cotton trade. Later, Britain vigorously fostered the trade of opium with China and developed the cultivation of poppy in India. The Ratlam-Mandsaur region (not far from Ahemdabad) became prime poppy cropland due to suitable soil and climate. Shiv Narayan Birla and his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, made an enormous fortune by trading opium with China, and this formed the basis of the family's fortune. With growing wealth and increasing confidence, Shiv Narayana Birla moved up the value chain and began chartering cargo ships in partnership with other Marwadi tradesmen to trade opium with China, thus by-passing British middlemen. To facilitate this, he moved to Bombay in 1863.\n\nShiv Narain Birla had one overwhelming sorrow in his life: he had no children. By the early 1880s, Shiv narayan (Narain) had passed on the baton of his business interests to his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, established Shivnarayan Baldevdas, a trading house based in Bombay. His son, Baldeo Das Birla moved to Calcutta set up Baldevdas Jugalkishor in 1887.\nBaldeo Das was succeeded by four sons – Jugal Kishore, Rameshwar Das, Ghanshyam Das and Braj Mohan.\n\nBaldeo Das was awarded the Raibahadur title in 1917. In 1920 he retired from business and started living in Banares pursuing religious studies. In 1925 he was awarded the title of \"Raja\" by the government of Bihar and Orissa. He was awarded D. Litt. by Beneras Hindu University.\n\nGhanshyam Das Birla laid the foundation of his industrial empire by establishing GM Birla Company, trading in jute, in 1911. The First World War began in 1914 greatly increasing the demand for jute sacks. During the war the Birla's worth is estimated to have risen from 2 million rupees to 8 million. In 1919, he became among the first group of Indian entrepreneurs to become owner of a Jute mill named Birla Jute. In the next few years he acquired several cotton mills. He later started several sugar mills. The publication Hindustan Times was co-founded by GD Birla in 1924 and fully acquired by him in 1933. Hindustan Motors was started in 1942. After India's independence in 1947 he started Grasim (Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing, 1948) and Hindalco (Hindustan Aluminium Company 1958) among others.\n\nBaldeo Das, as well his sons were among the key supporters of the swaraj movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, in addition to being dedicated Hindu activists. They were active supporters of the Banaras Hindu University founded by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya and were also financial supporters of activities initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. The landmark Laxminarayan Temple in Delhi was built by Jugal Kishore Birla and was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi and as asked by Mahatma, all Hindus, including harijans were welcomed in this temple.\n\nIn the few decades before India's independence, Indian merchants, including the Birlas, made successful attempts to enter and acquire industries in India which were once dominated by Scots from Britain. This became a part of Mahatma Gandhi's Swadeshi movement.\n\nBirlas remained close to some of the leaders of India, like Sardar Patel after India's independence. As leading industrialists, they were often accused by the leftists of exploiting their workers and aspiring to be among the richest in the world. Still when E. M. S. Namboodiripad became the chief minister of Kerala (1957–59), as a result of the first elected Marxist government anywhere, Birlas were invited to establish a pulp factory there.\n\nIn recent past, the Birlas, as well as several other Indian industrialists have expanded overseas.\n\nBirla philanthropy began in the 1880s, when the Birla family donated over 100,000 rupees for setting up goshalas (shelters for the protection of cows) in Kolkata. By early 1900, the Birla family began to support education, influenced by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. They supported educational charities in Kolkata and in Mumbai teaming up with Jamnalal Bajaj. In 1918, the family established the first high school in Pilani which evolved into BITS Pilani, which now has branches in Hyderabad, Goa and Dubai. They also opened a Sanskrit library in Benares and a library in Kolkata. It is well known for the financial support of Indian's freedom struggle and for building temples (see Birla Temple) in several major Indian cities.\n\nThe institutions founded by the Birlas include:\n\nIn a letter, Ghanshaym Das offered this advice to Aditya (his grandson) when he was studying at MIT: \n\nGD Birla instructed his son Basant Kumar to 'never utilize wealth only for fun and frolic,' to 'spend the bare minimum on yourself,' and to deride 'worldly pleasures.'\n\nThis advice symbolised the ethic of the rising Marwari community, with restraint and austerity its defining attributes.\n\nAlthough the Birlas are perceived as a single entity, the different branches of the family are now financially independent. However they have continued to maintain family relationships that go back to the times when \"Birla Brothers\" were an actual entity and Raja Baldevdas was still alive.\n\nBoth of GD Birla's wives died early because of tuberculosis (He remarried after the death of his first wife), a common affliction at that time. The families of his brothers Brij Mohan and Rameshwar Das Birla helped in raising his children. When Yash Birla's parents died in a plane crash, Priyamvada Birla, (\"Badi Ma\") helped take care of him.\n\nIt is reported that Kumar Mangalam Birla had dipped into his own resources to help his beleaguered relative Yash with his financial issues with creditors, in order to preserve the family name.\n\nFor many decades the extreme wealth in India was associated with the Tatas and Birlas. The words Tata-Birla were often used together. They were distantly followed by Dalmias (Dalmia-Sahu Jain group) for some time, however Tatas and Birlas have been able to sustain themselves as among the most prominent industrialists in India (for 1939-1997 data see) while others have declined.\n\nA plan for development of India was developed by a group of industrialists in 1944, which was termed the Tata-Birla plan or the Bombay plan, which is said to have served as a blueprint for India's first five-year plan.\n\nTwo South India comedy movies Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila and Tata Birla use the word pair. It also occurs in some songs.\n"}

Smaller communities (under 10,000 people) exist in Britain, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy. \n\nIn 2009 one scholar placed the total Coptic population of North America at more than 500,000.\n\nIn 1999, it was reported that there were \"over eighty Coptic churches, two theological colleges, and a monastery in the United States in Canada; twenty-five churches, a theological college, three schools, and two monasteries in Australia, and thirty churches and two monasteries in Europe.\"\n\nThere is also a Coptic presence in Lebanon and Jordan, and well as the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, such as the United Arab Emirates. There is also a Coptic presence (due to recent missionary work) in the sub-Saharan African countries of Zambia, Kenya, Zaire, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa.\n\nThe Coptic diaspora began primarily in the 1950s as result of discrimination, persecution of Copts and low income in Egypt. After Gamal Abdel Nasser rose to power, economic and social conditions deteriorated and many wealthier Egyptians, especially Copts, emigrated to Europe and the United States. Emigration increased following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and the emigration of poorer and less-educated Copts increased after 1972, when the World Council of Churches and other religious groups began assisting Copt immigration. Emigration of Egyptian Copts increased under Anwar al-Sadat (with many taking advantage of Sadat's \"open door\" policy to leave the country) and under Hosni Mubarak.\n\nMany Copts are university graduates in the professions, such as medicine and engineering.\n\n"}

A Maronite Christian, the younger son of former President Camille Chamoun and brother of Dory Chamoun, Chamoun was also a politician in his own right, and was known for his opposition to the occupation of Lebanese territory by foreign forces, whether Syrian or Israeli.\n\nChamoun was born in Deir el-Qamar on 26 August 1934. He was the younger son of the former President Camille Chamoun. He studied civil engineering in the United Kingdom.\n\nChamoun reported that he had not had any interest in politics before the Lebanon civil war. He became the National Liberal Party Secretary of Defense in January 1976, after the death of its predecessor Naim Berdkan. As Supreme Commander of the NLP's military wing, the Tigers, he also played a major role in the early years of the Lebanese Civil War.\n\nIn 1976, the NLP Tigers under Dany's command along with the Phalangist Kataeb Regulatory Forces, Al-Tanzim, and Guardians of the Cedars formed a joined militia command under the name Lebanese Forces.\n\nBy 1980, the Phalangist-dominated Lebanese Forces were under the command of Bachir Gemayel. Rivalry began to arise between Bashir and Dany. Dany's Tigers were eliminated as a military force in a massacre perpetrated on 7 July 1980 by the rival Phalangists. Chamoun's life was spared and he fled to the Sunni Muslim-dominated West Beirut. He then went into self-imposed exile.\n\nChamoun was a supporter of the nationalist Christian cause at heart, however, and he soon returned to the cause to which he, like his father, had dedicated his life. He served as General Secretary of the National Liberal Party from 1983 to 1985, when he replaced his father as the party leader. In 1988, he became President of the revived Lebanese Front—a coalition of nationalist and mainly Christian parties and politicians that his father had helped to found. The same year, he announced his candidacy for the Presidency of Lebanon to succeed Amine Gemayel (Bashir's brother), but Syria (which by this time occupied some 70 percent of Lebanese territory) vetoed his candidacy.\n\nGemayel's term expired on 23 September 1988 without the election of a successor. Chamoun declared his strong support for Michel Aoun, who had been appointed by the outgoing president to lead an interim administration and went on to lead one of two rival governments that contended for power over the next two years. He strongly opposed the Taif Agreement, which not only gave a greater share of power to the Muslim community than they had enjoyed previously, but more seriously, in Chamoun's opinion, formalized what he saw as the master-servant relationship between Syria and Lebanon, and refused to recognize the new government of the President Elias Hrawi, who was elected under the Taif Agreement.\n\nOn 21 October 1990, Chamoun, along with his German-born second wife Ingrid (forty-five), and his two sons, Tarek (seven) and Julian (five), were murdered. On 24 June 1995, the Lebanese Tribunal found Samir Geagea guilty of the assassination of Dany Chamoun and his family. Overwhelming evidence derived from investigations led to Geagea receiving a life sentence. The heavy sentence allegedly having been issued due to Syrian occupation influence on the tribunal, Geagea was released after the Syrian departure.\n\n"}

In 1984, he stormed into the National Assembly of Quebec building and opened fire with several firearms, killing three Quebec government employees and wounding 13 others. The National Assembly's Sergeant-at-Arms, René Jalbert, volunteered himself to serve as a hostage, and conversed with Lortie for several hours before convincing him to surrender to authorities. After a 1985 conviction of first-degree murder was overturned by the Quebec Court of Appeal, Lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987, for which he was convicted to life imprisonment with no parole for ten years. Lortie was granted day parole in 1995, then full parole in 1996, and has since kept a low profile.\n\nJoseph Laurent Paul Denis Lortie was born in Quebec, the youngest son of eight children, all of whom were physically and sexually abused by his father. Lortie's father reportedly fathered a child with one of his daughters. One of them finally went to the police and in 1969, Lortie's father was sentenced to three years in prison. Upon his release he did not return to his family.\n\nLortie joined the army and was stationed in Halifax, where he met and married Lisa Levesque in 1980. The couple had a son in 1982 and a daughter in 1983.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Lortie was stationed in CFS Carp, near Ottawa, was ranked a corporal, and worked as a supply technician in the Canadian Forces Logistics Branch.\n\nLortie was bilingual, but his English was relatively poor, and even when speaking French (his native language), he encountered pronunciation difficulties, resulting in irregular and halting speech. Lortie blamed his social and professional failures on his inability to speak English flawlessly, and was keenly aware that his poor English reinforced negative stereotypes of Francophones and Québécois. After the birth of his daughter, Lortie worried that he would become abusive in the manner of his father, and contemplated killing himself and his family before placing blame on the governing pro-sovereignty Parti Québécois for his problems (disliking the party's advocation of a \"Francophone identity\" for Quebec). Lortie planned the killing spree as a means of broadcasting his discontent.\n\nOn May 7, 1984, Lortie left the CFS Carp military base (originally built as a Diefenbunker during the Cold War), pretending that he needed time off to arrange a divorce with his wife. Instead, he rented a car, drove to Quebec City and took a guided tour of the Parliament Building. He then rented a room in a motel for the night.\n\nLortie had previously attempted to secure leave from his base, but was refused. It was during this encounter that Lortie later claimed he saw the face of his father on the face of the officer that denied his request.\n\nThe next day, May 8, 1984, at 9:30 a.m., Lortie walked into CJRP radio station in Quebec City, identified himself as \"Mr. D\", and dropped off a sealed envelope containing an audiotape for one of the station's hosts, André Arthur. He instructed the radio staff not to open the envelope until 10:30 a.m. but they opened it anyway, discovering that it was a statement of Lortie's plans, in which he declared, \"The government now in power is going to be destroyed.\" However, by the time radio staff contacted police, Lortie's plan had already been put into action.\n\nAt 9:45 a.m., Lortie entered the Parliament Building through a side door located on Grande-Allée. He was dressed in combat fatigues and armed with two C-1 submachine guns, an Inglis pistol, a duffel bag containing four hundred rounds of 9mm NATO ammunition, as well as a knife strapped to his leg. As he entered the building, he shot and mortally wounded a receptionist, then killed a messenger whom he encountered in a corridor. He then went into a smoking room and shot and wounded a person there before moving to the cafeteria, but finally found his way into the Assembly Chamber, outside of which dozens of armed Sûreté du Québec (SQ), as well as more than a dozen Groupe d'Intervention operatives and Quebec City Police (many carrying M2 carbines), helicopters, and snipers were taking position.\n\nBased on later testimony, it is clear that he intended to assassinate Premier René Lévesque and other members of the governing Parti Québécois. His plan was to enter the Assembly Chamber during the parliamentary committee meeting, which was starting at 10:00 that morning. However, instead of using a watch, Lortie timed his attack by listening to CJRP and waited for the station's host, André Arthur, to end his segment. Fortunately, on that day, Arthur ended his broadcast 20 minutes early, leading Lortie to enter the building and make his way to the Assembly Chamber while it was mostly empty. Lortie opened fire on the government employees still inside the Assembly Chamber, killing two and wounding 11 others. No politicians were killed or wounded.\n\nThe National Assembly's Sergeant-at-Arms, René Jalbert, was informed that there was a man in military uniform with a gun in the Assembly Chamber. Upon stepping out of the elevator, Lortie asked him why he came, and fired his C-1 Submachine gun inches from his face.\n\nJalbert proceeded to inform him that he too had been a soldier with the Van Doos (slang for the Royal 22nd Regiment), and that if Lortie would allow it, he would show him his discharge card. Lortie agreed, after which Jalbert persuaded him to show his own identification.\n\nAfter this exchange, Jalbert persuaded Lortie to come into his office to discuss the matter, and release the other civilians in the Assembly Chamber. Jalbert talked to Lortie for more than four hours, ultimately promising him that he would be able to surrender to military police (since he was unwilling to surrender to civilian police). At 2:15 PM, Lortie surrendered to officers of the SQ, Quebec City Police, and the National Assembly security.\n\nFor his heroic actions, which likely prevented further death, the Canadian government awarded Jalbert the Cross of Valour several months later, in the same National Assembly chamber that Lortie had burst into.\n\nThe following were killed in the shooting:\n\n\nOne of the contributing factors to the shooting was, allegedly, the easy access that Lortie had to both weapons and ammunition. Unlike other non-combat Canadian Forces Bases, CFS Carp, the base at which he was stationed, apparently did not have an armory, or even ammunition lockers.\n\nAccording to psychiatrist Pierre Mailloux, who was assigned to the case, Lortie suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and had organized his crime during a psychotic episode, believing that he was acting on instructions given to him from God. Nevertheless, in 1985, Lortie was convicted of first-degree murder, but a new trial was ordered when the Quebec Court of Appeal determined the trial judge had made errors while instructing jurors about how they should weigh testimony from psychiatrists heard in the case.\n\nLortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987.\n\nIn 1995, Lortie was released on day parole to a halfway house in Hull, Quebec, after being released from a minimum security correctional facility north of Montreal where he had been undergoing psychiatric treatment, classes to deal with aggression, and serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 10 years. According to officials from the Parole Board of Canada, Lortie no longer posed a threat to society, and \"patched his life together despite being responsible for one of the most notorious events in Quebec history\".\n\nUnder the release terms, Lortie was required to spend every night at the halfway house between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. He was also required to let parole board supervisors know where he was at all times, and was restricted to a 40 kilometer (24.8 mile) radius from the house. The relatives of some of Lortie's victims believed he was not punished severely enough, with some believing he should have been executed, a punishment that could not and cannot be applied as Canada abolished its death penalty in 1976.\n\nGranted full parole in July 1996 (the same year Jalbert died of cancer), he has since kept a low profile.\n\nHe is last known to have worked at a dépanneur in the Hull—Aylmer district of Quebec, and is now married, with a steady job and a house, and has reportedly been forthcoming with \"the people who monitor his case\".\n\n\n"}

The main Hiten probe lacked the fuel to enter lunar orbit using a conventional Hohmann transfer trajectory, but Belbruno was able to devise a ballistic capture trajectory that would put it in lunar orbit using only a negligible amount of fuel. The probe entered lunar orbit in 1991, the first time that Belbruno's ideas had been put to the test.\n\nBelbruno had first proposed using a low-energy transfer orbit for a JPL probe in 1988. However, he faced a great deal of skepticism, and found himself in conflict with engineers.

He also served as court painter to Emperor Menelik II and was a recipient of the Greek Military Cross.\n\nAt the age of fifteen he was working as an icon painter and attracted the attention of Hortense Wood, an English artist who was living near Smyrna. She gave him drawing lessons and presented his work to Nikiforos Lytras, who recommended Prokopiou to the Athens School of Fine Arts. He enrolled there in 1895, studying with Lytras and Georgios Roilos. In 1901, after completing his studies, he returned to Smyrna and held his first exhibition. Two years later, he travelled to Alexandria and Cairo, where he painted portraits of notable figures in the Greek communities there, including Pavlos Melas, who introduced him to the head of Ethiopia's diplomatic mission.\n\nThis resulted in an invitation to visit Addis Ababa to do a portrait of Emperor Menelik. He went there by caravan from Djibouti, accompanied by his brother Socrates, who would later write a book about the trip. After competing with several other painters, he was chosen to become the Court Painter in 1905. In addition to painting the Royal Family, he portrayed several ambassadors as well as landscapes and village scenes. Lavish with honors, the Emperor awarded him the Order of Solomon, the Order of the Star of Ethiopia and other lesser-known medals.\n\nIn 1907, he returned to Athens to marry, travelled extensively, and settled in Smyrna in 1913. The beginning of World War I found Smyrna blockaded by the Allies. Soon after, the Ottomans began persecuting Christians. This included setting up \"labor battalions\" which were soon revealed as actually being death battalions. Most of the Greek population, including Prokopiou and his family, went into hiding. Somehow, he found work as an art teacher for the daughter of an Ottoman official, which afforded him protection. It was at this time that he created his first war art; depictions of the campaign in the Dardanelles.\n\nAfter the war, Smyrna came under Greek control. The following year, General Leonidas Paraskevopoulos commissioned him to produce paintings, photographs and films of the Greek campaigns against the Turks during the Greco-Turkish War. Although they admired his courage, a few commanders complained that his activities interfered with military operations. After the Turkish recapture of Smyrna, he returned home to be with his family and remained to take photographs of the Great Fire.\nWhen the chaos had subsided, he was arrested and sentenced to death by a Turkish tribunal. Luckily, the prison commandant allowed him to say goodbye to his family. With the assistance of his neighbors and the French Consul, he and his family were able to escape aboard a French ship that took them to Piraeus. In 1925, he settled in Athens. He continued to paint military scenes from memory until 1928, after which he produced a variety of nudes, scenes of ruins and portraits, including one of Haile Selassie, who visited his studio shortly before becoming Emperor.\n\nIn 1940, the Greco-Italian War began when Greece refused to capitulate to the Axis Powers. Although Prokopiou was sixty-four years old and ill with bronchitis, he went to the War Ministry, begging to be sent to the front. Finally, he wrote to Prime Minister Metaxas, saying that he was ashamed to stay at home when his two sons were out fighting for Greece. Metaxas agreed to his request, and Prokopiou left for Albania to join the Greek counter-offensive. He met up with his son, Angelos, sketching and taking photographs almost immediately. One night, several weeks later, when the temperature fell below zero, he died of heart failure. He was given the posthumous rank of Colonel, brought back to Athens, and buried with full military honors.\n\n"}

He is protected by the powerful Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark, who also acts as his accomplice. Kevin lives at the Roark family farm, and uses the basement as an execution chamber for his victims; after he kills and eats them, he stuffs and mounts their heads on the walls like hunting trophies.\n\nWhile he appears harmless and unassuming, Kevin is a fierce, inhumanly fast fighter adept in martial arts; accordingly, the Roark family uses him as an assassin from time to time. He is usually accompanied by his pet wolf, which he feeds whatever parts of his victims he does not eat himself.\n\n\"The Hard Goodbye\" establishes Kevin's back story, as related by Cardinal Roark. He first meets Roark when going to him for confession, wracked with guilt over the murders he is committing. Roark eventually comes to believe that Kevin is doing God's work by consuming his victims' souls as well as their bodies, and eventually joins him in cannibalistic rituals. Roark also claims that Kevin is mute by choice, and when he speaks it is with \"the voice of an angel\".\n\nIn the main plot, Kevin kills Marv's one true love, Goldie, at Cardinal Roark's behest when she learns the truth about their murder spree; he then frames Marv for the crime. Marv swears revenge, and cuts a bloody swath through the city's underworld until he learns the identity of the killer he seeks.

{"id": "29767204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29767204", "title": "Olivia Shakespear", "text": "Olivia Shakespear\n\nOlivia Shakespear (née Tucker; 17 March 1863 – 3 October 1938) was a British novelist, playwright, and patron of the arts. She wrote six books that are described as \"marriage problem\" novels. Her works sold poorly, sometimes only a few hundred copies. Her last novel, \"Uncle Hilary\", is considered her best. She wrote two plays in collaboration with Florence Farr.\n\nOlivia was the daughter of a retired Adjutant General, and had little formal education. She was well-read however, and developed a love of literature. In 1885 she married London barrister Henry Hope Shakespear, and in 1886 gave birth to their only child, Dorothy. In 1894 her literary interests led to a friendship with William Butler Yeats that became physically intimate in 1896. He declared that they \"had many days of happiness\" to come, but the affair ended in 1897. They nevertheless remained lifelong friends and corresponded frequently. Yeats went on to marry Georgie Hyde-Lees, Olivia's step-niece and Dorothy's best friend.\n\nOlivia began hosting weekly salons frequented by Ezra Pound and other modernist writers and artists in 1909, and became influential in London literary society. Olivia's daughter Dorothy Shakespear married Pound in 1914, despite the less than enthusiastic blessing of her parents. After their marriage, Pound would use funds received from Olivia to support T. S. Eliot and James Joyce. When Dorothy gave birth to a son, Omar Pound, in France in 1926, Olivia assumed guardianship of the boy. He lived with Olivia until her death twelve years later, in 1938.\n\nOlivia's father, Henry Tod Tucker, was born in Edinburgh and joined the British Indian Army as an ensign at age 16. He rose to the rank of Adjutant General in Bengal, but retired in 1856 at age 48 owing to ill health. Within a year of returning to Britain he married Harriet Johnson (b. 1821) of Bath. The couple moved to the Isle of Wight where their two daughters were born: Florence in 1858 and Olivia on 17 March 1863. Soon after they relocated to Sussex where their third child, Henry, was born in 1866. In 1877 the family moved to London and raised their daughters in a social world that encouraged the pursuit of leisure. \n\nOlivia often visited her many Johnson relatives in the country, and became particularly fond of her cousin Lionel Johnson—the only one of many uncles and cousins not to join the military—who went on to become a poet and friend to W. B. Yeats. It is likely that Olivia received little formal education; she may have been educated by tutors, and appears to have become well-read as a young woman.\n\nIn 1885 Olivia married Henry Hope Shakespear, a man described by Terence Brown in \"The Life of W.B. Yeats: A Critical Biography\" as \"worthy\" but \"dull\". Born in India in 1849, he was descended from 17th-century East London ropemakers and, like Olivia, came from a military family, although of less prestige and wealth than the Tuckers and Johnsons.\n\nHenry had attended Harrow, studied law, and joined a law practice in 1875. The couple were married on 8 December 1885, and honeymooned in Boulogne and Paris. Olivia's father endowed them with a comfortable income in the form of a trust. Nine months after the wedding their only child, Dorothy, was born on 14 September 1886; Olivia realised soon that the marriage was devoid of passion. Yeats' biographer Alexander Jeffares writes, \"she was unselfcentered, unselfish, deeply imaginative and sympathetic and, until she met Yeats, she seems to have accepted the fact of her unhappy loveless marriage\".\n\nShakespear dissolved his legal partnership in the late 1880s—his partner may have been embezzling from clients' trusts—and formed his own practice. Harwood writes that Shakespear's attitude to the situation showed a certain amount of \"timidity\" on his part and a definite \"dislike of scenes\". During this period Olivia moved from socialising with military wives to literary women: Valentine Fox (unhappily married to a Kent brewer) and Pearl Craigie, a divorced American writer who published as John Oliver Hobbes.\n\nAccompanied by Pearl Craigie, on 16 April 1894, Olivia attended a literary dinner to launch \"The Yellow Book\". Olivia was seated opposite W. B. Yeats. Recently returned from visiting Maud Gonne in Paris, Yeats was in London for the production of his play \"The Land of Heart's Desire\". The two were not introduced that evening but Yeats, probably through Lionel Johnson (who became disruptively drunk at the dinner), enquired about the woman seated opposite. Yeats was deeply affected, later writing in his memoirs of the encounter: \"I noticed opposite me ... a woman of great beauty ... She was exquisitely dressed ... and suggested to me an incomparable distinction.\" \n\nSoon after, Olivia attended a showing of \"The Land of Heart's Desire\", and found herself moved by the performance. She wanted to meet the \"tall and black haired\" poet and asked Johnson to invite Yeats to tea on 10 May 1894, adding in her handwriting to the invitation, \"I shall be so glad to see you\". In his \"Memoirs\" Yeats referred to her as \"Diana Vernon\", writing, \"In this book I cannot giver her real name—Diana Vernon sounds pleasantly in my ears and will suit as well as any other\".\nThey quickly established a strong friendship, with Olivia listening sympathetically to his obsessive love for Maud. When Yeats later described their friendship, he wrote, \"I told her of my love sorrow, indeed it was my obsession, never leaving by day or night\". Writing in \"The Last Courtly Lover\", Gloria Kline suggests Olivia and Yeats began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work. \n\nJohn Unterecker, writing in \"Faces and False Faces\", sees friendship as the most important aspect in the relationship, explaining, \"she found in Yeats, as he in her, a person who could discuss literature and ideas ... she was one of the few persons with whom he could be completely relaxed\". Comparing the difference between Maud and Olivia he writes, \"Maud Gonne offered Yeats subject matter for poetry, the 'interesting' life he had hoped for, and Olivia Shakespear offered him repose\". \n\nAccording to Kline, Yeats compared Olivia to Diana and Maud to Helen; he was attracted to dark coloured women, describing Olivia's skin as \"a little darker than a Greek's would have been and her hair was very dark\". Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes that Yeats' impression of Olivia was one of a woman with \"a profound culture, a knowledge of French, English, and Italian and seemed always at leisure. Her nature was gentle and contemplative, and she was content, it seems, to have no more of life than leisure and the talk of her friends\". \n\nNevertheless, she was working on her third novel, \"Beauty's Hour\", and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, suggested revisions, and may have contributed to the characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.\n\nIn August Yeats returned to Ireland, continuing his correspondence with Olivia, writing to her about Maud who had recently given birth to a daughter, Iseult. In her letters Olivia may have been honest about her feelings toward him; in April 1895 he wrote to her, \"I no more complain of your writing of love, than I would complain of a portrait painter keeping to portraits\".\n\nYeats delayed visiting Olivia in London a month later; he instead tended to Johnson who was involved in the Wilde case and descending into the alcoholism that would kill him. Yeats appeared to have persuaded himself that Olivia and her cousin shared a flaw, writing, \"here is the same weakness I thought ... Her beauty ... dark and still, had the nobility of defeated things, and how could it help but wring my heart. I took a fortnight to decide what I should do\". He constructed a plan to reconcile his desire with what he believed to be her wickedness: he would ask that she leave her husband to live with him. Until then their friendship would remain platonic.\n\nYeats finally visited Olivia at her Porchester Square home a few weeks later to present his well-thought out intentions but, to his bewilderment, Olivia declared her love for him. Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing \"but after all if I could not get the woman I loved it would be a comfort for a little while to devote myself to another\". For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each seek advice from a friend (a \"sponsor\"). He probably chose Florence Farr to be his sponsor while Olivia chose Valentine Fox—Harwood speculates that the sponsors advised the two to go ahead with the affair, perhaps to Yeats' discomfort. \n\nOn 15 July 1895, Yeats and Olivia traveled to Kent to visit Valentine Fox; the trip Harwood says \"would have been, emotionally speaking a highly charged outing\". Of the railway trip, Yeats wrote in his memoirs, \"when on our first railway journey together—we were to spend the day at Kent—she gave the long passionate kiss of love, I was startled & a little shocked\". They went on to share more passionate kisses in art galleries and at her home.\n\nStill distressed about Lionel, Yeats turned to Arthur Symons for companionship, moving into a room adjacent to his in October 1895. One day while preoccupied and thinking about Maud he locked himself out for a visit just before Olivia and her sponsor arrived to visit; as soon as she left he stayed up all night telling Symons about Maud. She arrived in London a few weeks later for a brief visit. \n\nYeats was ambivalent about Olivia despite the advice of the sponsors; with no money to support her, he suggested she seek a legal separation (instead of a divorce), sparing her social ostracism and financial ruin. Ezra Pound biographer Jay Wilhelm suggests Shakespear knew that Olivia loved Yeats but seemed more concerned about the loss of social status in the event of divorce, causing Yeats and Olivia to decide that \"it was kinder to simply deceive him than totally abandon him\". \n\nIn January 1896 Yeats moved again, into a small flat in Woburn Place, so as to be nearer to her. Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats describing \"an embarrassed conversation upon the width\", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, \"at last she came to me in my thirtieth year ... and we had many days of happiness\". Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.\n\nSix months later he was in back in Ireland, and in August Olivia was visiting Valentine Fox with her husband where she received news of her father's death. She left for an extended stay in Torquay where she stayed until September before leaving for a visit to Scotland with her husband. Yeats left Ireland for Paris to visit Maud in November, and did not return to London until January 1897, with Maud following close behind and arriving in London in February. Yeats wrote of Maud's visit: \"Maud wrote to me ... she was in London & would I come to dine. I dined with her & my trouble increased—she certainly had no thought of the mischief she was doing – & at last one morning ... [Olivia] found my mood did not answer hers and & burst into tears—'There is someone else in your heart' she said. It was the breaking between us for many years\". The affair ended that spring when Yeats again returned to Ireland. Olivia did not visit him again at Woburn Place for many years, according to Yeats biographer Richard Ellmann.\n\nOlivia's life is not well documented between 1897 and 1908. She visited her cousin Lionel for the last time in 1897 before he was isolated by his alcoholism. He died alone of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1902. In 1899 the family suffered an unspecified financial setback that forced them to move into an apartment in Bayswater to Pembroke Mansions, which a friend described by as \"an uninviting Bayswater slum\". A few months later Olivia's mother died. Within a week Olivia received a letter of condolence from Yeats, which may have been the first letter she received from him in two years, since 1897. Several scholars and biographers speculate that they resumed their love affair at some point between 1903 and 1910; Pound biographer Wilhelm believes they reconciled as early as 1903, while Yeats biographers Jeffares and Ross suggest the affair likely reignited for a period in 1906.\n\nFor a short time in 1901 Olivia held a position as a book reviewer for \"The Kensington Review\", a small literary magazine, until it succumbed to poor sales. After, she dabbled in the occult and became friendly with prominent London occultists. In 1902 she co-wrote with Florence Farr — who for a time led the Order of Golden Dawn — two plays on the occult, \"The Beloved of Hathor\" and \"The Shrine of the Golden Hawk\", which were subsequently published as a pair.\n\nAlthough the family received an inheritance from Olivia's mother, they continued to live in Bayswater. For a period Dorothy was at boarding school, after which she was sent to a finishing school in Geneva. To save money, the family often left London during the summer, to take long visits to relatives in the country, in particular her brother Henry Tucker. Not until 1905 did the family lease a house in Brunswick Gardens, near Kensington Palace, when Dorothy returned home to live with her parents.\n\nRecords of Olivia's life resume through Dorothy's letters and diaries surrounding the arrival of the American poet Ezra Pound in London in 1909. Following her friends in Kensington society, Olivia opened her home once a week for a salon, beginning an important period in her life. When Yeats returned to London that year, Olivia became the centre of a blossoming literary movement. Yeats held a Monday evening salon; those who attended usually also visited Olivia's. She hosted, and became a nexus for, much of the pre-war literary activity in London. Notable attendees included Pound, Hilda Doolitle, Yeats, Wyndham Lewis, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Walter Morse Rummel, Richard Aldington, William Carlos Williams, T. E. Hulme and John Cournos. The gatherings were held in her drawing room, a place Pound described in a letter as \"full of white magic\". Olivia was by now a well-known occultist and hosted séances in her drawing room. She became well-versed in astrology and palmistry, passing on what she knew to Dorothy who shared her interest. Both read grimoires; Olivia was an expert at \"drawing occult symbols\" and quite familiar with the symbology of the occult. \n\nOlivia met Pound in January 1909 at a Kensington salon hosted by a friend; she invited him for tea on 16 February 1909, and, at his insistence, introduced Pound to Yeats in May 1909. Yeats had recently returned to London and began a thorough investigation of spiritualism and the occult, turning to Olivia for advice. She took the young American poet to Yeats' rooms at Woburn Place, fostering their relationship.\n\nDorothy soon fell in love with Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy attended his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain whether he intended to stay in New York or return to London.\n\nIn 1910 Yeats thought his horoscope suggested a return to Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to Pound. A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.\n\nPound returned from America in 1911 and resumed his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused on the basis of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once a week or every two weeks.\n\nOlivia became concerned about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You told me you were prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way ... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly \"decent\"! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see her ... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate ... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her!\n\nIn 1913, Olivia introduced Pound to vorticist sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska at an art exhibition at the Albert Hall. At the same exhibition the sculptor met Nina Hamnett, whom he subsequently used as a model for a series of nudes bronzes, one of which Olivia bought. In 1914, Olivia translated a grimoire for Yeats and Pound, who spent November 1913 to January 1914 in the countryside at Stone Cottage in Ashdown Forest—Pound acting as secretary to Yeats—researching the occult. They read several grimoires, and Olivia provided for them a translation of the Abbot of Villar's 1670 grimoire \"Le Comte de Gabalis\". Her translation was serialised in the literary magazine \"The Egoist\" later that year.\n\nBy 1914 Olivia seems to have realised that Dorothy was determined to marry Pound, and finally consented; ironically Pound was then earning less than he had in 1911. Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20 April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus drawings by Pablo Picasso.\n\nAfter Dorothy's wedding much of the documentation of Olivia's life ceases. She moved out of Brunswick Gardens in 1924, throwing away personal correspondence and giving away hundreds of books. Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in West Kensington, taking with her two maids who had been with the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy gave birth to a son, Omar Pound, who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.\nIn 1926 Yeats spent several weeks in London, likely visiting Olivia frequently. He showed regret for his behaviour in 1897, writing to her, \"I came across two early photographs of you yesterday ... Who ever had a like profile?—a profile from a Sicilian coin. One looks back to one's youth as to a cup that a mad man dying of thirst left half tasted. I wonder if you feel like that?\" The two maintained their correspondence, as they had for many years.\n\nOlivia continued to socialise and had many friends, one of whom, Wyndham Lewis, painted her portrait; he enjoyed her company despite finding it difficult to relate to others. She stopped writing but remained an avid reader, turning to detective stories for light relief although she also kept up with literary authors. She became friendly with Thomas MacGreevy, whom she invited for tea, later writing to him, \"WBY has given me the new edition of \"Reveries and the Veil\", & I am re-reading it all. It is very beautifully done. He was about 29 when I first knew him\". McGreevy told Yeats that Olivia was \"always a symbol of elegance, a kind of gold and ivory image\". Harwood writes of her, \"Olivia Shakespear was avant-garde in literature, agnostic in religion, and conservative in politics, at least later in life\".\n\nOlivia's correspondence with Pound continued throughout the 1920s and 1930s, when she acted in part as his agent in London. In 1924, at Pound's request, she welcomed George Antheil into her social circle, procured artwork and books that were sent on to Dorothy and Ezra in Rapallo, and mediated in a dispute between Pound and Lewis. She was uninterested in Pound's politics and economic views and particularly disliked his later Cantos. After her husband's death, Olivia's income was sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle. During the 1920s and 1930s she gradually increased Dorothy's income (which was also increased by various family bequests), and in the 1930s she made investments in Dorothy's name, sending the proceeds to Dorothy and Pound. In a very real sense, according to Harwood, Olivia Shakespear is the \"unsung heroine\" of the modernist period, because much of the money Ezra Pound generously used to support struggling writers such as T.S. Eliot and James Joyce came from her.\n\nOlivia died of complications brought on by gall bladder disease on 3 October 1938. The day before her death she wrote in a letter to Dorothy: \"On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went ... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck\". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman ... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude ... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.\n\nDorothy was ill when her mother died, unable to travel to London. She sent Pound to organise the funeral and to clear out the house. Ezra sorted through Olivia's correspondence and returned to Yeats many of her letters. Unterecker writes that Yeats made an effort to keep the correspondence private: \"Shortly before his death he methodically destroyed a large group of letters to Olivia Shakespear. These, returned to him after her death ... Yeats wanted no one to read\".\n\nOlivia had six novels published between 1894 and 1910, which as described by Foster are about women unhappy in love, with insipid and uninspiring male characters. The heroines—frequently orphaned, educated by elderly tutors, and depicted in country house libraries—fall in love with much older men in the later novels.\n\nThe first two novels were published in 1894 to mixed reviews. \"Love on a Mortal Lease\" (title from George Meredith) was released in June, followed in November by \"The Journey of High Honour\", at 30,000 words considerably shorter than the 355 pages of \"Love on a Mortal Lease\". Each novel sold only a few hundred copies. Harwood describes the early work such as \"Love on a Mortal Lease\" as showing stylistic similarities to contemporary women novelists such as Craighie and Rhonda Broughton, with witty dialogue in Craighie's style, although he thinks Olivia brought a more serious voice to her work. He describes \"Love on a Mortal Lease\" as a work in which the heroine is well-characterised but the background is weak.\n\nIn the summer of 1896, \"The Savoy,\" edited by Arthur Symons, published a two-part novella by Shakespear called \"Beauty's Hour\". Anne Margaret Daniel says that the story was inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1886), with the dilemma of good vs. evil translated here into that of an unattractive woman who longs for beauty. In 2016, Valancourt Books published Daniel's edition of \"Beauty's Hour\", marking the first return to print of Shakespear's fiction for many decades.\n\nShe dedicated \"The False Laurel\", published in 1896, to Lionel Johnson. The plot features a poetess who falls in love with and marries an insipid young poet, giving up her own writing to attend to his needs. She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. \"The False Laurel\" was the least successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from \"The Bookman\" but a good one from \"The Athenaeneum\".\n\n\"Rupert Armstrong\" was published in 1899 by Harper and Brothers, dedicated to Valentine Fox. In this, the fourth of her novels, Harwood believes her writing and voice became more original. The complicated plot—a mother and daughter struggle for \"possession of the [father's] artistic soul\"—shows hints of incestuous love, a theme found in her later work. Written during the affair with Yeats, Harwood sees the characters presented \"in a precise, bitter intensity unlike anything in the earlier work\".\n\n\"The Devotees\" was published by Heinemann in December 1900. Like \"Rupert Armstrong\", the plot of \"The Devotees\" depicts a mildly incestuous love: a young man and girl, raised together since childhood, devote themselves for decades to his drug-addicted mother before they marry. The reviews were mostly unkind.\n\nOlivia's final novel, \"Uncle Hilary,\" was published in 1910 and is considered her best work. Of \"Uncle Hilary\" Jane Eldridge Miller writes in \"Rebel Women: Feminism, Modernism, and the Edwardian Novel\", \"Shakespear demonstrates the ways in which that ideal leads to disillusionment and resentment\". In the complicated plot a young woman unwittingly marries her stepfather, leaves him, and accepts a marriage proposal from her guardian. Harwood believes her loveless marriage, the love affair with Yeats, the frustration with Dorothy, and Pound's unfaithfulness to Dorothy, built in her a strength and acceptance of life that bordered on the spiritual and she no longer needed to write. \n\nMiller writes that in the novel Olivia explores \"marriage laws, divorce, and bigamy\", with a focus on the nature of romantic love—rejected in favour of spiritual and intellectual pursuits. Leon Surette writes in \"The Birth of Modernism\", Olivia's \"Uncle Hilary\" highlights the ties between spiritualism, occultism and feminism, seeing \"Uncle Hilary\" as a feminist novel which he describes as \"quite readable\".\n\nJane Miller characterises the works as \"marriage problem\" novels in which the wife confronts the reality of marriage, its restrictions, and the need to achieve independence. By finding interests outside marriage the wife loses the overwhelming need for love within the marriage. Miller writes that in \"Uncle Hilary\" Olivia examines issues such as marriage laws, divorce, and bigamy, while focusing on the nature of romantic love. It was in \"Uncle Hilary\" that Olivia wrote of love: \"Love is the worst slavery that exists ... it is the most persistent of illusions\".\n\n\nReferences\nSources\n\n"}

He was born in the city of Eskentos in Cappadocia, in Eastern Asia Minor (modern day Turkey). His original name, \"Philopater\" (variant spellings include \"Philopateer\" and \"Philopatyr\"), means \"lover of the Father\". Saint Mercurius is also known by the name \"Abu-Seifein\" (أبو سيفين), which in Arabic means \"the holder [literally, owns/possess] of two swords,\" referring to a second sword given to him, by the Archangel Michael.\n\nSome accounts state that Philopater was born in Eskentos in Cappadocia. However, others refer to Rome as his place of birth. Philopater was the son of Yares, a Scythian officer in the Roman army. One day, while Yares was hunting in the forest with his father, the two were attacked by an animal. The animal jumped on Yares' father, causing Yares to faint. While Yares was unconscious, he had a vision with a brilliant light and a voice saying:Yares, I am your God who loves you. I know that you have a good heart and that you hate the pagan idols. I want to inform you that your son, Philopatyr, will become like a tree bearing good fruits, and because of him, I will bless you and your wife. Philopatyr will be my witness and will defy all prejudice in my name.\n\nYares, his wife, and his son were baptized shortly after. All three were given new names. Yares became \"Noah\", his wife became \"Saphina\", and Philopater became \"Mercurius\". News of their baptism spread quickly in the city and the prince ordered them to be arrested and thrown to wild animals. However, the animals did not harm them and the prince decided to release Noah and his family.\nWhen the Berbers attacked, Noah went to fight them. He was taken prisoner and was brought to their country where he was kept for seventeen months. When the war finally ended, he went back to his city and joined his family, but died shortly after.\n\nSt. Philopater Mercurius is also said to be the cousin of St. George of Cappadocia.\nAfter the death of Noah, the pagan Roman Emperor Decius (ruled 249-251) chose Mercurius to replace his father. Described as very strong and courageous, Mercurius earned the respect of his fellow soldiers and gained renown as a swordsman. When the Berbers attacked Rome, Decius went out to fight them but became afraid when he saw how many there were. Mercurius then came to him and said, \"Do not be afraid, because God will kill our enemies and will bring us victory.\"\n\nAfter several days of fighting, the Archangel Michael appeared to Mercurius holding a shining sword. The saint took the sword from the archangel, hence the name \"Abu-Seifein\" - \"the holder of two swords\": a military sword and a divine sword. He conquered the Berbers. When Decius heard news of the triumphant victory, he named Mercurius as a prince.\n\nNonetheless, in 249, Decius began his persecution of Christians, compelling everyone to offer sacrifices to his pagan gods. The Archangel Michael appeared to Mercurius and told him to remember God and not be fearful of persecution. The saint was encouraged and spent the whole night praying fervently, confessing his weakness to God.\n\nThe Emperor sent messengers to summon Mercurius to the palace, saying: \"Dear Mercurius, let us go offer incense to the gods who helped us attain victory in the war.\" As they were leaving, Mercurius slipped through the crowd and went away. However, one of the guards reported his absence, and the Emperor called Mercurius and asked him: \"Is it true that you refused to worship the idols who helped us during the war?\" Mercurius declared himself a Christian, saying, \"I do not worship anyone except my Lord and my God, Jesus Christ.\"\n\nThe Emperor tried to persuade him to give up his faith but failed. He then ordered Mercurius to be stripped of his rank and tortured. Fearing a revolt because the people loved Mercurius, the emperor had him bound in iron fetters and sent him to Caesarea. Mercurius was beheaded on 4 December 250 AD. He was only 25 years old.\n\nAfter the end of the first persecution, the place of the saint's burial was revealed. Mercurius appeared to a poor man in the city and told him that he was \"Mercurius, the Martyr of the Lord.\" \"My body is buried in Cappadocia Gardens, under the old house on the way to the royal palace. My body looks as white as snow, because Jesus was present at the time of my martyrdom,\" said the saint.\n\nThe next morning, the man went to dig under the old house. He began to smell the scent of perfume, seeing the body of the saint. The news spread quickly and many people came to take a look at the blessed body. They moved it temporarily to the local church until they built a new church bearing his name where Mercurius' body was buried with respect and devotion.\n\nA few years later, the Catholicos of Armenia and the Chief bishop of the Armenian Apostolic Church, visited Egypt and met with the Patriarch of Alexandria, the leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church. The latter asked him if Egypt could have part of the relics of Saint Mercurius to be placed in the church that bears his name in Egypt. On 9 Paoni (16 June), part of the blessed relics of Saint Mercurius were transferred to Egypt.\n\nAccording to one tradition, Saint Basil once prayed before an icon on which Mercurius was portrayed as a soldier carrying a spear. He asked God not to permit the emperor Julian the Apostate (361-363) to return from his war against the Persians and resume his oppression of Christians. The image of the holy Great Martyr Mercurius depicted on the icon became invisible, only to reappear later with a bloodied spear. Julian the Apostate, on his Persian campaign, was mortally wounded by the spear of an unknown soldier.\n\nThe nuns at the St. Mercurius Monastery in Cairo credit the saint's intercession for the reversal of a government decision to confiscate their property for the Defense Ministry.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "220986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220986", "title": "Sans-culottes", "text": "Sans-culottes\n\nThe sans-culottes (, literally \"without breeches\") were the common people of the lower classes in late 18th century France, a great many of whom became radical and militant partisans of the French Revolution in response to their poor quality of life under the \"Ancien Régime\". The name \"sans-culottes\" refers to their clothing, and through that to their lower-class status: \"culottes\" were the fashionable silk knee-breeches of the 18th-century nobility and bourgeoisie, and the working class \"sans-culottes\" wore \"pantaloons\", or trousers, instead. The \"sans-culottes\", most of them urban labourers, served as the driving popular force behind the revolution. Though ill-clad and ill-equipped, they made up the bulk of the Revolutionary army during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars.\n\nThe most fundamental political ideals of the \"sans-culottes\" were social equality, economic equality, and popular democracy. They supported the abolition of all the authority and privileges of the monarchy, nobility, and Roman Catholic clergy, the establishment of fixed wages, the implementation of price controls to ensure affordable food and other essentials, and vigilance against counter-revolutionaries. The height of their influence spanned roughly from the original overthrow of the monarchy in 1792 to the Thermidorian Reaction in 1794. Throughout the revolution, the \"sans-culottes\" provided the principal support behind the more radical and anti-bourgeoisie factions of the Paris Commune, such as the Enragés and the Hébertists, and were led by populist revolutionaries such as Jacques Roux and Jacques Hébert. The \"sans-culottes\" also populated the ranks of paramilitary forces charged with physically enforcing the policies and legislation of the revolutionary government, a task that commonly included violence and the carrying out of executions against perceived enemies of the revolution.\n\nDuring the peak of their influence, the \"sans-culottes\" were seen as the truest and most authentic sons of the French Revolution, held up as living representations of the revolutionary spirit. During the height of revolutionary fervor, such as during the Reign of Terror when it was dangerous to be associated with anything counter-revolutionary, even public functionaries and officials actually from middle or upper-class backgrounds adopted the clothing and label of the \"sans-culottes\" as a demonstration of solidarity with the working class and patriotism for the new French Republic.\n\nBut by early 1794, as the bourgeois and middle class elements of the revolution began to gain more political influence, the fervent working class radicalism of the \"sans-culottes\" rapidly began falling out of favor within the National Convention. It wasn't long before Maximilien de Robespierre and his now dominant Jacobin Club turned against the radical factions of the National Convention, including the \"sans-culottes\", despite their having previously been the strongest supporters of the revolution and its government. Several important leaders of the Enragés and Hébertists were imprisoned and executed by the very revolutionary tribunals they had supported. The execution of radical leader Jacques Hébert spelled the decline of the \"sans-culottes\", and with the successive rise of even more conservative governments, the Thermidorian Convention and the French Directory, they were definitively silenced as a political force. After the defeat of the 1795 popular revolt in Paris, the \"sans-culottes\" ceased to play any effective political role in France until the July Revolution of 1830.\n\nThe distinctive costume of typical \"sans-culottes\" featured:\n \nThe working class was especially hurt by a hail storm which damaged grain crops in 1788, which caused bread prices to skyrocket. While the peasants of rural France could sustain themselves with their farms, and the wealthy aristocracy could still afford bread, the urban workers of France, the group that comprised the \"sans-culottes\", suffered. In the city, division grew between the \"sans-culottes\" and these wealthy aristocrats; the former had a particular hostility “towards those with large private incomes.”\nThe faction known as the Montagnards expressed concern for the working classes of France. When the National Convention met to discuss the fate of the former king Louis XVI in 1792, the \"sans-culottes\" vehemently opposed a proper trial, instead opting for an immediate execution. The moderate Girondin faction voted for a trial, but the radical Montagnards sided with the \"sans-culottes\", deeming that a trial was not necessary, and won with a slim majority. Louis XVI was executed on January 17, 1793. \n\nThe demands of the \"sans-culottes\" did not stop with the execution of the King, and the Montagnards worked hard to fulfill their mounting orders. This increased pressure from the radical masses exacerbated the ideological split between the Montagnards and the Girondins, and tensions began to grow within the Convention. Eventually, by May of 1793, the Montagnards worked with the National Guard -- which was, at this time, mostly \"sans-culottes\" -- to depose many of the Girondin deputies. Jeremy Popkin writes, “[the Montagnards and the \"sans-culottes\"] surrounded the Convention, and two days later they intimidated assembly suspended twenty-nine Girondin deputies. The defeated Girondin leaders fled to the provinces. The Montagnards were left in control of the Convention, which itself was clearly at the mercy of whoever could command the armed \"sans-culottes\" battalions.” Now, whoever was in control of France’s destiny had to answer to the \"sans-culottes\", who “effectively exercised legislative power” in situations of unrest. Otherwise, they would risk a similar uprising and their own exile, or possibly even execution. This political shift towards radicalism would soon turn into the Reign of Terror.\n\nThe mass violence of the \"sans-culottes\" created a lasting impact on the Reign of Terror. These revolutionaries allied themselves most readily with those in power who promised radical change. The \"sans-culottes\" believed in a complete upheaval of the government, pushing for the execution of any that were considered corrupt by the leaders, even going as far as wanting “the enemies of the republic [to] hang-main and the guillotine to stand like the first patriots, the finisher of the law.” The support of the \"sans-culottes\" could be used as a political weapon to get rid of enemies of the Revolution. The key to Robespierre’s Terror lay in their willingness and ability to mobilize. Thus, the Committee leaders used speeches to gain their support. In a speech \"On the Principles of Political Morality.\" Robespierre proclaimed: “It has been said that terror was the mainspring of despotic government. Does your government, then, resemble a despotism? Yes, as the sword which glitters in the hands of liberty's heroes resembles the one with which tyranny's lackeys are armed.” Robespierre expressed a desire for liberty that the \"sans-culottes\" admired. They pushed the Committee for radical changes and often found a voice with Robespierre. Their desperate desire for immediate changes and their aptitude for violence made the \"sans-culottes\" a necessary group in implementing the Terror. \nThe popular image of the \"sans-culotte\" has gained currency as an enduring symbol for the passion, idealism and patriotism of the common man of the French Revolution. The term sans-culottism, \"sans-culottisme\" in French, refers to this idealized image and the themes associated with it. Many public figures and revolutionaries who were not strictly working class styled themselves \"citoyens sans-culottes\" in solidarity and recognition. However, in the period immediately following the Thermidorian Reaction the \"sans-culottes\" and other far-left political factions were heavily persecuted and repressed by the likes of the Muscadins.\n\nThe French Republican Calendar at first termed the complementary days at the end of the year \"Sansculottides\"; however, the National Convention suppressed the name when adopting the Constitution of the Year III (1795) and substituted the name \"jours complémentaires\" (\"additional days\").\n\nAccording to Sally Waller, part of the \"sans-culottes\" mantra was \"permanent anticipation of betrayal and treachery\". The members of the \"sans-culottes\" were constantly on edge and fearing betrayal, which can be attributed to their violent and radical rebellion tactics.\nMarxist historian Eric Hobsbawm observes that the \"sans-culottes\" were a 'shapeless, mostly urban movement of the labouring poor, small craftsmen, shopkeepers, artisans, tiny entrepreneurs and the like'. He further notes they were organised notably in the local political clubs of Paris and \"provided the main striking-force of the revolution\". Hobsbawm writes that these were the actual demonstrators, rioters and constructors of street barricades. However, Hobsbawm maintains, \"sans-culottism\" provided no real alternative to the bourgeois radicalism of the Jacobins; from Hobsbawm's Marxist perspective, the ideal of the \"sans-culottes\", which sought to express the interests of the 'little men' who existed between the poles of the bourgeois and the proletarian, was contradictory and ultimately unrealizable.\n\nThe Marxist historian Albert Soboul emphasized the importance of the \"sans-culottes\" as a social class, a sort of proto-proletariat that played a central role in the French Revolution. That view has been sharply attacked by scholars who say the \"sans-culottes\" were not a class at all. Indeed, as one historian points out, Soboul's concept has not been used by scholars in any other period of French history.\n\nIronically, given its origin as a term to describe men's breeches, the term \"culottes\" in French is now used to describe women's underpants, an article of clothing that has little or no relation to the historic culottes. The term \"sans-culottes\" has been used colloquially to mean not wearing underpants.\n\n\n"}

From the late 1970's to the mid-1980's he worked against the organisation from within as an intelligence agent for the Irish Government with the Garda Síochána's Special Branch. \n\nIn the mid-1980's he left the Provisional IRA and subsequently voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution for actions he had engaged in as a PIRA gunman in the 1970's. Following his release from imprisonment, he published a memoir detailing his life in Irish paramilitarism entitled \"The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man's War on Terrorism\" (1998). \n\nFormer Irish Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald described O'Callaghan as one of the Irish Government's most important spies operating within the Provisional IRA during the late 20th Century's paramilitary war in Ulster.\n\nO'Callaghan was born on 26 January 1954, into a family with a Fenian paramilitary history, in Tralee, County Kerry. His paternal grandfather had taken the Anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, and his father had been interned by the Irish Government at the Curragh Camp in County Kildare for IRA activity during World War II.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the teenaged O'Callaghan had ceased practising the Catholic faith, adopted atheism and had become interested in the theories of Marxist revolutionary politics, which found an outlet of practical expression in the sectarian social unrest in Ulster at that time, centred on the activities of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. In 1969, an outbreak of communal violence broke out in Ulster and believing that British imperialism was responsible, O'Callaghan joined the newly founded Provisional IRA at the age of 17. \n\nSoon afterwards, he was arrested by local Gardaí after he accidentally detonated a small amount of explosives, which caused damage to the homes of his parents and their neighbours. After demanding, and receiving, treatment as a political prisoner, O'Callaghan quietly served his sentence.\n\nAfter becoming a full-time paramilitary with the Provisional IRA, in the early to mid 1970's O'Callaghan took part in over seventy terrorist operations, including bomb materials manufacture, attacks on multiple PIRA targets in Ulster, and robberies to provide funding for the organisation. On 2 May 1974 he was part of an attack by a PIRA force on a lightly manned 6th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment facility at the village of Clogher in County Tyrone, with sustained automatic-rifle fire, anti-tank rockets, and rounds fired from an improvised mortar which was operated by O'Callaghan. During this attack a \"Greenfinch\" female U.D.R. recruit, the 28 year old Eva Martin, was killed. On 23 August 1974 O'Callaghan killed Detective Inspector Peter Augustine Flanagan, a 47 year old Ulster Catholic police officer and head of the Omagh Division of the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch, by shooting him repeatedly with a handgun in a two man PIRA attack in a public house in the town of Omagh in County Tyrone.\n\nIn 1976, aged 22, O'Callaghan ended his involvement with the Provisional IRA after becoming disillusioned with its activities, and what he perceived was an undercurrent of ethnic hatred in its rank and file, and he left Ireland and moved to London. In May 1978, he married a Scottish woman of Protestant unionist descent. During the late 1970s, he ran a successful mobile cleaning business. However, he was unable to fully settle in his new life, later recalling: \"In truth there seemed to be no escaping from Ireland. At the strangest of times I would find myself reliving the events of my years in the IRA. As the years went on, I came to believe that the Provisional IRA was the greatest enemy of democracy and decency in Ireland\".\n\nIn 1979 O'Callaghan was approached by the IRA seeking to recruit him again for its paramilitary terrorist campaign. In response, he decided to turncoat against the organization and become an agent within its ranks for the Irish Government. In his memoir, O'Callaghan described his reasoning as follows: \n\nI had been brought up to believe that you had to take responsibility for your own actions. If you did something wrong then you made amends. I came to believe that individuals taking responsibility for their own actions is the basis for civilisation, without that safety net we have nothing. \n\nSoon after being approached by the IRA to re-join he returned to Tralee from London, where he arranged a clandestine meeting with an officer of the Garda Special Branch in a local cemetery, at which O'Callaghan expressed his willingness to work with it to subvert the IRA from within. At this point, O'Callaghan was still opposed to working with the British Government. A few weeks later, O'Callaghan made contact with Kerry IRA leader Martin Ferris and attended his first IRA meeting since 1975. Immediately afterwards, he telephoned his Garda contact and said, \"We're in\". According to O'Callaghan, \"Over the next few months plans to carry out various armed robberies were put together by the local IRA. It was relatively easy for me to foil these attempts; an occasional Garda car or roadblock at the 'wrong time'; the routine arrest of Ferris or myself; or simple 'bad planning', such as a car arriving late – a whole series of random stratagems\".\n\nDuring the 1981 hunger strike in the Maze Prison, he attempted to start his own hunger strike in support of the Maze prisoners but was told to desist by the IRA for fear it would detract focus from the prisoners. O'Callaghan successfully sabotaged the efforts of republicans in Kerry from staging hunger strikes of their own.\n\nIn 1984, he notified the Garda of an attempt to smuggle in a fishing trawler named the \"Valhalla\" across the Atlantic seven tons of AK-47 assault rifles from the United States to Ireland for the arsenal of the Provisional IRA's units. The shipment had been organised by the Winter Hill Gang, an Irish-American crime family based in South Boston, Massachusetts. As a result, the cargo was intercepted by a combined force of the Irish Navy and the Garda Síochána.\n\nO'Callaghan claimed to have been tasked in 1983 by the IRA with placing 25lb of Frangex in the Dominion Theatre in London, to try to kill Prince Charles and Princess Diana who were due to attend a charity pop music concert there. A warning was phoned into the Garda, and the Royal couple were hurriedly ushered from the theatre by their police bodyguard during the concert. The theatre had been searched before the concert and a second search following the warning revealed no device.\n\nIn 1985, O'Callaghan was elected as a Sinn Féin councillor for Tralee Urban District Council, and unsuccessfully contested a seat on Kerry County Council.\n\nAfter becoming disillusioned with his work with the Irish Government after the murder of another of its agents within the Provisional IRA (Sean Corcoran in County Kerry in 1985), which it had failed to prevent despite O'Callaghan's warnings of the threat to him, and sensing a growing threat to himself from the organization which had become suspicious of aspects of his actions, O'Callaghan withdrew from the Provisional IRA and left Ireland to live in England, taking his wife and children with him. His marriage ended in a divorce in 1987, and on 29 November 1988 he walked into a police station in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, where, presenting himself to the officer on duty at the desk he confessed to the murder of UDR Greenfinch (female member) Eva Martin and the murder of D.I. Peter Flanagan during the mid-1970s, and voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution. \n\nAlthough the Royal Ulster Constabulary offered him witness protection as part of the informer policy, O'Callaghan refused it, and was prosecuted under charges of two murders and 40 other crimes, to all of which he pled guilty, committed in British jurisdiction with the Provisional IRA. Having been found guilty he was jailed for a total of 539 years. O'Callaghan served his sentence in prisons in Ulster and England. While in jail, he published his story in \"The Sunday Times\". He was released as part of a Prerogative of Mercy by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996.\n\nIn 1998 O'Callaghan published an autobiographical account of his experiences in Irish paramilitarism, entitled \"The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man's War on Terrorism\" (1998). In the book's text he stated (shortly before the death in Ulster of Eamon Collins, another former Provisional I.R.A. member who had prominently turned upon Irish paramilitarism);\n\nI know that the organisation led by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness would like to murder me. I know that that organisation will go on murdering other people until they are finally defeated. It is my belief that in spite of IRA/Sinn Féin's strategic cunning, and no matter how many people they kill, the people of the Irish Republic expect, because they have been told so by John Hume, that there will be peace. There may come a time when their patience runs out. If that were to happen there would be no place for IRA/Sinn Féin to hide. We must work tirelessly to bring that day forward.\n\nO'Callaghan lived relatively openly in London for the rest of his life, having refused to adopt a new identity. He was befriended in the city by the Irish writer Ruth Dudley Edwards, and worked as a security consultant, and also occasional advisor to the Ulster Unionist Party on how to handle Irish Republicanism in general, and Sinn Fein in particular. \n\nIn 2006, O'Callaghan appeared in a London court with regard to an aggravated robbery that had occurred in which he was the victim.\n\nIn 2015 O'Callaghan published \"James Connolly: My Search for the Man, the Myth & his Legacy\" (2015), a book containing a critique of the early 20th Century Irish revolutionary James Connolly, and what O'Callaghan considered to be his destructive legacy in Ireland's contemporary politics.\n\nSources in Sinn Féin have publicly denied aspects of the statements made by O'Callaghan with regard to his IRA career, particularly the claim that he had attained the leadership of the IRA's \"Southern Command\", and had been a delegate to the IRA Army Council, claims O'Callaghan made both in print and before a Dublin jury under oath. A 1997 article in \"An Phoblacht\", published by Sinn Féin, the political wing of the PIRA, alleged that O'Callaghan \"has been forced to overstate his importance in the IRA, and to make increasingly outlandish accusations against individual republicans\".\n\nHe claimed to have attended an IRA finance meeting in Letterkenny in 1980 alongside, among others, Pat Finucane and Gerry Adams. \n\nFinucane denied being an IRA member, and Adams has never acknowledged membership in any proscribed organisation. In Finucane's case, the RUC and the Stevens Report indicated he was not an IRA member, although he came from an Irish Republican background and three of his brothers (Dermot, John, and Seamus) were members of the IRA.\n\nO'Callaghan died by drowning after suffering a heart-attack at the age of 62 while in a swimming-pool in Kingston, Jamaica in August 2017, while visiting his daughter, Tara. His death was reported on 23 August 2017. A memorial service was held to his memory on 21 March 2018 at St Martin's in the Fields Church, in London, which was attended by representatives from Ulster Unionist parties and the Irish Government.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "868103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=868103", "title": "Shang Tsung", "text": "Shang Tsung\n\nShang Tsung (尚宗 - pinyin: \"shàng zōng\") is a fictional boss and player character from the \"Mortal Kombat\" series. A powerful evil warlock, he is a demonic shapeshifter who absorbs the living souls of those he defeats in order to maintain his youth and power and is able to change his appearance, including by morphing into other characters while retaining their abilities and movesets in-game. Shang Tsung is usually portrayed as the right-hand man of series archvillain Shao Kahn and the main rival and archenemy of Liu Kang. \n\nShang Tsung debuted in the original \"Mortal Kombat\", serving as the in-game tournament's grandmaster and the game's boss. He has since appeared in several games and other media spawned from the franchise, and was received positively by game critics.\nAccording to the first \"Mortal Kombat\" comic, Shang Tsung was cursed by his gods to steal souls, or he would age rapidly and die prematurely. However, stealing souls allowed him to absorb his victims' knowledge and fighting skills as well. He entered the Mortal Kombat tournament, overcoming all competition and becoming Grand Champion. After his defeat, he became the tournament's coordinator, unfairly tipping the scales in Outworld's favor for nine tournaments so that Shao Kahn could conquer Earth. He and his protege and champion Goro are defeated by the Shaolin Monk Liu Kang in the tenth tournament.\n\nIn \"Mortal Kombat II\", Shao Kahn restores Shang Tsung's youth and tries to lure Earth's warriors into Outworld to give the emperor the advantage. While Shang Tsung and his master are defeated, this plot is merely a distraction while Shang Tsung resurrects Shao Kahn's wife Sindel in Earthrealm. Kahn crosses the dimensional boundaries to claim her, which merges Earthrealm with Outworld and enslaves the souls of billions of people. Shang Tsung is assigned to hunt down survivors, but is defeated by Liu Kang again.\n\nIn , Shang Tsung joins forces with fellow sorcerer Quan Chi in a bid to conquer the realms by resurrecting the Dragon King's invincible army. Their plan goes awry when the Dragon King himself returns from the dead, reclaiming his army. When Raiden releases his godly essence in a last-ditch effort to defeat the Dragon King, Shang Tsung dies as well, but he is revived in \"Mortal Kombat Armageddon\" before the final battle between good and evil.\n\nHe is also featured as a playable character in \"Mortal Kombat\" (2011). As the game is a reboot of the first three titles in the series, his role is mostly consistent with these; however, near the story's end, Shao Kahn steals his soul and uses it to empower Sindel before sending her to kill the Earthrealm defenders.\n\nShang Tsung was not included in the roster of \"Mortal Kombat X\" (2015), but appears in Ermac's ending by stealing Ermac's souls in order to reconstitute himself, and in a flashback in Erron Black's ending that sees him slowing Black's aging process in exchange for his assassination of an Earthrealm warrior. He is additionally mentioned by name in several mirror-match introductions as a possible explanation as to why the characters fight themselves.\n\nShang Tsung (originally named \"Shang Lao\") was based on the Chinese sorcerer Lo Pan from the film \"Big Trouble in Little China\". A character named \"Kitsune\", which was later developed into Kitana, \"was going to fit into the story as Shang Lao’s (Tsung) princess daughter - the spoil of victory for winning the tournament\", who would betray her father after she fell for Liu Kang. \"Mortal Kombat\" art director Herman Sanchez said that as the series progressed he decided to emphasize Tsung's air of \"sinister regality.\"\n\nShang Tsung's design varies throughout the series. The initial history of the character was explained in the 1992 Midway-produced comic book based on the original \"MK\" game, in which he was the first-ever Mortal Kombat (then the Shaolin Tournament) champion over 500 years ago from the date of the then-current tournament depicted in the actual game, yet he was stricken with a curse that forced him to consume the souls of his defeated opponents in order to keep his youth. The book cited his \"failure to appease the gods\" as the reason for his premature aging to a withered old man, but he was noticeably younger in \"Mortal Kombat II\", in which Shao Kahn had restored Shang Tsung's youth and powers as part of his plan to take over Earthrealm by luring Liu Kang and his fellow Earth warriors into Outworld for the next MK tournament.\n\nAccording to \"GamePro\" magazine in 1993, the \"MKII\" version of Shang Tsung was nineteen years old, and an article about the game also included a rough sketch by \"Mortal Kombat\" co-creator John Tobias of Tsung's \"true form,\" a twisted demon, which has never actually appeared in the video games. Tobias wanted Shang Tsung's long hair to hang loose in \"Mortal Kombat 3\", but potential problems with it flopping about whenever he jumped resulted in it being tied back into a ponytail. Responding to player queries about how Shang Tsung's last name is pronounced, Acclaim Entertainment stated in 1994 that there is no one definitively correct way of pronouncing the character's name. \nIn the original \"Mortal Kombat\" game Shang Tsung is a computer-controlled boss. He fires flaming skull projectiles and can morph into other characters at will; this gives him access to all of the Kombatants' signature moves. As a player character, he retains his morphing ability, but can only transform into player characters. Also, his skull projectile's versatility is expanded: he can summon skulls from above or below the opponent as well as shoot multiple skulls from his hands.\n\nTsung's shapeshifting went mostly unused in \"Deadly Alliance\", \"Deception\", \"Armageddon\", and \"Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\". Ed Boon explained this was due to a lack of sufficient memory. It returns in the 2011 game, but its use is more limited; a player-controlled Shang Tsung can only morph into his current opponent.\n\nShang Tsung plays his original role of main villain in the first series of the Malibu Comics' \"Blood & Thunder\" miniseries, with his backstory mostly unchanged as an old man serving Shao Kahn to open the portal through 10 consecutive Mortal Kombat wins. He and Raiden share a bitter relationship, usually ending in either verbal assaults or draw fights. While Shang Tsung hosted the tenth tournament, he secretly planned to gain the powers of the mystical book Tao Te Zhan, which granted immense strength to whoever resolves its seven riddles. Shang Tsung and Raiden later join forces to stop Goro after he took the power of the book, since he cannot be trusted with such strength. During the \"Battlewave\" miniseries, it is implied that Shang Tsung resumed the tournament after his plans were foiled and lost it alongside Goro at the hands of Liu Kang. He is seen in the first pages of issue #1 being pursued and punished by Shao Kahn, Kintaro, and Gorbak (Goro's father). Even though Shao Kahn supposedly punished him, he later appears in the last page of issue #5 completely rejuvenated and still under Shao Kahn's servitude. Shang Tsung would later serve as leader of Shao Kahn's team during the tournament he prepared in the last issue of the series, \"Tournament Edition II\". Shang Tsung's last appearance is during the 1995 \"Kung Lao\" one-shot comic, in which he serves as antagonist, attempting to kill Kung Lao through deceptive tricks using his shapeshifting abilities. In the 2015 \"Mortal Kombat X\" prequel published by DC Comics, in which he has not appeared, his island is described as having been taken over by Reiko and Havik following his death.\n\nShang Tsung is also the prime villain of the animated film \"\", voiced by Jim Cummings. In this version, he is portrayed as having the ability to read his opponent's thoughts during battle (an ability which is not present in the game series), allowing him to predict their attacks and adapt his own strategy to exploit the opponent's greatest weakness.\n\nShang Tsung appeared in several episodes of the animated series \"\", voiced by Neil Ross.\n\nIn the \"\" TV series, Shang Tsung was portrayed by Bruce Locke as a sorcerer eager to take revenge on the Great Kung Lao, who had defeated him in Mortal Kombat. For most of the series, he was confined to Shao Kahn's cobalt mines for his failure in the Mortal Kombat tournament, although he occasionally escapes, since his powers are unaffected by the cobalt in the mines due to his human heritage. While in the mines, he keeps Kreeyan princess Vorpax as his personal slave (both literal and pleasure), and generally mistreats her until she receives her mother's powers.\n\nShang Tsung appeared briefly in the short film \"\", portrayed by James Lew, and in the third episode of the webseries \"\", played by Johnson Phan. Tagawa reprised his role from the movie for the second season.\n\nShang Tsung was featured along with Raiden, Ermac, Jax, and Scorpion in a 2014 animated short film parodying \"Mortal Kombat\" that was produced by Comedy Central and titled \"The Tournament of Fighting Styles.\" He was renamed \"Yao Zhang\" and was the host of a secret underground tournament that is halted when a match featuring \"Iron Shogun\" (Scorpion) goes awry after the tournament's other contestants are no-shows, leaving Zhang scrambling to find a replacement. Iron Shogun is eventually declared the tournament winner when he kills a pizza deliveryman who unwittingly enters the arena. Shang Tsung appeared in a 2012 episode of \"The Annoying Orange\", played by Bobby Jennings (Bobjenz).\n\nThe character was met with a positive critical reception. Shang Tsung was ranked 17th on GameDaily's 2009 list of top evil masterminds of all time, which noted his attack style and goals while stating he is \"one twisted freak.\" That same year, GamesRadar listed him as one of the top villains who will never stay dead. He was also sixth on GamesRadar's list of most misunderstood videogame villains. GamesRadar also listed his fatality where he morphs into Kintaro from \"Mortal Kombat II\" as one of \"ten greatest things about \"Mortal Kombat\"\". In 2010, Shang Tsung was ranked 97th in IGN's list of top video game villains, with a comment that \"considering Shang Tsung's devious powers and his cruel methods, his status as a reputable villain of the series is well deserved.\"\n\nHe was also ranked as third in Game Revolution's list of top old school \"Mortal Kombat\" characters for his ability to morph into other fighters during battles. Game Rant ranked Shang Tsung at number five on their list of \"most awesome\" \"Mortal Kombat\" characters, praising his ability to transform into other characters and adding \"despite Shang Tsung’s limited arsenal of unique special attacks, the character still provides experienced players with a stylish way to dispatch opponents.\" In 2011, GameFront ranked his moustache in \"MK2011\" as the fourth best moustache in video games. In UGO's 2012 list of top \"Mortal Kombat\" characters, Shang Tsung placed at 15th. \"Complex\" placed this \"cold-blooded mastermind\" at the top of their lists of the greatest wizards in games in 2012, calling him the \"coolest video game wizard ever, by far,\" and of the most brutal fighters in \"Mortal Kombat\" in 2013. In 2013, \"Complex\" also included his transformation into Kintaro and his \"Soul Purge\" in \"MK3\" among the best finishing moves in the series.\n"}

Hale (born Stephen Fowler Hale; January 31, 1816 – July 18, 1862) was an American politician who served as a Deputy from Alabama to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862. In July 1862, he died of wounds received at the Battle of Gaines' Farm, in Virginia.\n\nHale was born on January 31, 1816, in Crittenden County, Kentucky. His father was a Baptist minister, a South Carolinian, who married a Miss Manahan, of the same state. He was a graduate of Cumberland University, came to Alabama about 1837, and taught school in Greene County for a year. He read law while teaching school, and in 1839 graduated from the law school at Lexington, Kentucky. Locating in Eutaw, he practiced at different times in association with Alexander Graham and T.C. Clarke.\n\nIn 1843 he was elected to the State legislature from Greene County. After serving his term in the house, he met and married Mary Kirksey on June 12, 1844 and retired to private life until the outbreak of the Mexican War in 1846, when he volunteered and was elected lieutenant of a company. He served in Mexico until the conclusion of peace in 1848, he then returned to Eutaw to his law practice. He was the nominee of his party for congress in 1853, but was defeated; was elected to the legislature again in 1857; was re-elected in 1859; and was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Alabama in 1859.\n\nIn December 1860, Hale, who was Alabama's commissioner to State of Kentucky at the time, wrote to that state's governor of Alabama's justification for secession. In it, he voiced support for the \"Dred Scott\" decision, condemned the Republican Party, and stated that the state's secession, which would perpetuate slavery, was the only way to prevent prospective freedmen, whom Hale referred to as \"half-civilized Africans\", from raping southern \"wives and daughters\":\n\nWhen the secession ordinance was passed, he was appointed commissioner to Kentucky by Governor Moore and delivered an able address before the legislation at Frankford. That same year, he was elected to represent his district in the provisional congress of the Confederacy. While holding that position, he was chosen as a lieutenant colonel of the 11th Alabama Infantry Regiment, and repaired with it to Virginia. He remained with that command until after the battle of Seven Pines, when he was temporarily assigned to the Ninth Alabama regiment and led it into battle. The fall of Col. Moore obliged him to return to the Eleventh regiment, which he led at the Battle of Gaines' Mill, sometimes known as the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Battle of Chickahominy River on June 27, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia.\n\nThis was the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign, March–July 1862).

He is also considered to be ruler of Neno-Katasu-Kuni (根之堅洲國) (now Yasugi, Shimane-ken). He is married to Kushinadahime.\n\nIn Japanese mythology, Susanoo, the powerful storm god of Summer, is the brother of Amaterasu, the goddess of the Sun, and of Tsukuyomi, the god of the Moon. All three were born from Izanagi, when he washed his face clean of the pollutants of Yomi, the underworld. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye, and Susanoo from the washing of the nose. Susanoo used Totsuka-no-Tsurugi as his weapon.\n\nThe oldest sources for Susanoo myths are the ca. 712 CE \"Kojiki\" and ca. 720 CE \"Nihon Shoki\". They tell of a long-standing rivalry between Susanoo and his sister. When he was to leave Heaven by orders of Izanagi, he went to bid his sister goodbye. Amaterasu was suspicious, but when Susanoo proposed a challenge to prove his sincerity, she accepted. Each of them took an object of the other's and from it birthed gods and goddesses. Amaterasu birthed three women from Susanoo's Totsuka-no-Tsurugi while he birthed five men from her necklace. Claiming the gods were hers because they were born of her necklace, and the goddesses were his, she decided that she had won the challenge, as his item produced women. The two were content for a time, but Susanoo, the Storm God, became restless. In a fit of rage, he destroyed his sister's rice fields, hurled a flayed pony at her loom, and killed one of her attendants. Amaterasu, who was in fury and grief, hid inside the Ama-no-Iwato (\"heavenly rock cave\"), thus effectively hiding the sun for a long period of time.\n\nThough she was persuaded to leave the cave (with the help of a ceremony and a unique style of dancing), Susano-o was punished by being banished from Heaven. He descended to the province of Izumo, where he met an elderly couple who told him that seven of their eight daughters had been devoured by the eight-headed dragon Yamata no Orochi and it was nearing time for their eighth, . The Nihon Shoki, here translated by William George Aston in \"Nihongi\", gives the most detailed account of Susanoo and Amaterasu slaying Yamata no Orochi. Compare to that found in the Kojiki, translated by Basil Hall Chamberlain in \"The Kojiki\" (1919:71-3), where Susanoo is translated as \"His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness\":\nThen Susanoo no Mikoto descended from Heaven and proceeded to the head-waters of the River Hi, in the province of Idzumo. At this time he heard a sound of weeping at the head-waters of the river, and he went in search of the sound. He found there an old man and an old woman. Between them was set a young girl, whom they were caressing and lamenting over. Susanoo no Mikoto asked them, saying:-\"Who are ye, and why do ye lament thus?\" The answer was:-\"I am an Earthly Deity, and my name is Ashi-nadzuchi. My wife's name is Te-nadzuchi. This girl is our daughter, and her name is Kushi-nada-hime. The reason of our weeping is that formerly we had eight children, daughters. But they have been devoured year after year by an eight-forked serpent and now the time approaches for this girl to be devoured. There is no means of escape for her, and therefore do we grieve.” Sosa no wo no Mikoto said: \"If that is so, wilt thou give me thy daughter?\" He replied, and said: \"I will comply with thy behest and give her to thee.\" Therefore Sosa no wo no Mikoto on the spot changed Kushi-nada-hime into a many-toothed close-comb which he stuck in the august knot of his hair. Then he made Ashi-nadzuchi and Te-nadzuchi to brew eight-fold sake, to make eight cupboards, in each of them to set a tub filled with sake, and so to await its coming. When the time came, the serpent actually appeared. It had an eight-forked head and an eight-forked tail; its eyes were red, like the winter-cherry; and on its back firs and cypresses were growing. As it crawled it extended over a space of eight hills and eight valleys. Now when it came and found the sake, each head drank up one tub, and it became drunken and fell asleep. Then Susanoo no Mikoto drew the ten-span sword which he wore, and chopped the serpent into small pieces. When he came to the tail, the edge of his sword was slightly notched, and he therefore split open the tail and examined it. In the inside there was a sword. This is the sword which is called Kusa-nagi no tsurugi.\n\nThis sword from the dragon's tail, the \"Ama-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi\" (\"Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven\") or the \"Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi\" (\"Grasscutter Sword\"), was presented by Susanoo to Amaterasu as a reconciliation gift. According to legends, she bequeathed it to her descendant Ninigi along with the \"Yata no Kagami\" mirror and Yasakani no Magatama jewel or orb. This sacred sword, mirror and jewel collectively became the three Imperial Regalia of Japan.\n\nWhile Amaterasu is enshrined at the Honden of the Ise Grand Shrine, Susanoo is enshrined at Kumano Taisha located in Shimane (formerly the Izumo region), where he descended when banished from heaven.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a co-author of the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nHobson was dispatched from London in August 1839 with instructions to take the constitutional steps needed to establish a British colony in New Zealand. He was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor in Sydney (under George Gipps) and arrived in New Zealand on 29 January 1840. On 5 February 1840, Hobson met with Māori chiefs at Waitangi, where they signed a treaty by which the chiefs voluntarily transferred sovereignty to the British Crown in return for guarantees respecting their lands and possessions and their rights as British subjects. Three months later, Hobson proclaimed British sovereignty over the islands of New Zealand. He also selected the site for a capital in the North Island, which he named Auckland.\n\nIn May 1841, New Zealand was constituted as a separate Crown colony, with Hobson promoted to Governor and Commander in Chief. In his final months Hobson was dogged by poor health which left him detached from political affairs. He died in office in September 1842.\n\nWilliam Hobson was born in Waterford, Ireland, the son of Samuel Hobson, a barrister. He was raised in an Anglo-Irish, Anglican family. \n\nHe joined the Royal Navy on 25 August 1803 as a second-class volunteer. He served in the Napoleonic wars and was later involved in the suppression of piracy in the Caribbean. He became a midshipman in 1806 and some seven years later was a first lieutenant. He was promoted to commander in May 1824 and commanded between 1826 and 1828. In December 1834, he obtained a commission from Lord Auckland to the East Indies on .\n\nIn 1836, he was ordered to Australia, arriving at Hobart on 5 August 1836 and at Sydney 18 days later. On 18 September 1836, HMS \"Rattlesnake\" left for Port Phillip District (later Melbourne) conveying Captain Lonsdale and other officials to the new colony. During the next three months, Hobson and his officers thoroughly surveyed Port Phillip, the northern portion of which, by direction of Governor Sir Richard Bourke, was named Hobsons Bay, after him. His ship was involved in the founding of Williamstown. He was offered the position of Superintendent of the Bombay Marine at a salary of £2000 a year, but he had taken a liking to Australia and was a candidate for the governorship of Port Phillip, although the salary was not expected to be more than £800 a year.\n\nThe more recently created City of Hobsons Bay is also name after William.\n\nOn 26 May 1837 Hobson sailed to the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, in response to a request for help from James Busby, the British Resident, who felt threatened by wars between Māori iwi (tribes). For three months in 1837 Pōmare II (Whiria) fought with Tītore until a peace agreement was negotiated by Tareha. On his return to England in 1838, Hobson submitted a report on New Zealand, in which he proposed establishing British sovereignty over the islands in small pockets similar to the Hudson's Bay Company in Canada.\n\nAt the time, the British government recognised the sovereignty of the Māori people, as represented in the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand of October 1835. Hobson was appointed Lieutenant Governor under the Governor of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps (ratified on 30 July 1839) and British consul to New Zealand (confirmed on 13 August 1839). On 14 August 1839 Lord Normanby issued him with detailed instructions, giving reasons for intervention in New Zealand and directions for the purchase of land \"by fair and equal contracts\". (The land was later resold to Pākehā settlers at a profit to provide for further operations.)\n\nHobson arrived in the Bay of Islands aboard HMS \"Herald\" on 29 January 1840 (which northern New Zealanders mark as Auckland Anniversary Day) with a small group of officials, including an Executive Council consisting of Colonial Secretary Willoughby Shortland, Colonial Treasurer George Cooper and Attorney-General Francis Fisher. The Legislative Council comprised the above officials and three Justices of the Peace. Hobson appointed as three Magistrates, Messrs. Shortland, Johnson, and Matthew.\n\nThe Treaty of Waitangi was first proposed by Hobson on his return to Britain from his first visit to New Zealand. Upon arrival in New Zealand, Hobson almost immediately drafted the Treaty of Waitangi together with his secretary James Freeman and James Busby. Busby had previously drafted the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand.\n\nHobson headed the British signatories. Of the 40 or so Māori chiefs, the Ngapuhi chief Hōne Heke was the first to sign the treaty. As each chief signed, Hobson said \"He iwi tahi tātou\", meaning \"We are [now] one people\". To enhance the authority of the treaty eight further copies were made and sent around the country to gather additional signatures. After obtaining signatures to the Treaty at the Bay of Islands (6 February 1840), he travelled to Waitematā Harbour to obtain more signatures and to survey a suitable location for a new capital (he also sent the Deputy Surveyor-General, William Cornwallis Symonds, to other areas to obtain more signatures). After suffering a stroke on 1 March 1840, he was taken back to the Bay of Islands, where he recovered sufficiently to continue work.\n\nOn 21 May 1840, in response to the creation of a \"republic\" by the New Zealand Company settlers of Port Nicholson (later Wellington), who were laying out a new town under the flag of an independent New Zealand, Hobson asserted British sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand, despite the incompleteness of the treaty signing. He sent Willoughby Shortland and some soldiers to Port Nicholson on 25 May 1840, and the council of the settlers was disbanded. Their leader, William Wakefield, later travelled to the Bay of Islands to pledge allegiance to the Crown. His suggestion to make Port Nicholson the capital was rejected in favour of Hobson's plan for a new town on Waitematā Harbour, to be named Auckland after the Earl of Auckland.\n\nOn 11 July 1840 the French frigate \"L'Aube\" arrived at the Bay of Islands on its way to Banks Peninsula as part of the settlement plan of the Nanto-Bordelaise Company. Hobson immediately sent two magistrates to the area to establish the British claim to sovereignty by holding courts.\n\nNear the end of 1840, the Port Nicholson settlers sent a petition to Queen Victoria calling for Hobson's dismissal over his treatment of them. Hobson responded on 26 May 1841 to the Foreign Secretary.\n\nIn November 1840, the Queen signed a royal charter for New Zealand to become a Crown colony separate from New South Wales. Hobson was sworn in by the Chief Justice as Governor and Commander in Chief on 3 May 1841.\n\nHobson travelled to Wellington in August 1841, where he heard the complaints of settlers and selected magistrates. He then visited Akaroa to settle the French claims. Back in Auckland, he had some difficulty with the Māori, and his government was ridiculed by journalists in Wellington and Auckland. He responded by closing down the \"New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette\". With his government low on funds, he resorted to issuing unauthorised bills on the British Treasury in 1842. Hobson faced opposition from the \"Senate clique\" radicals who sent a petition to the Foreign Secretary to have Hobson recalled. One of Hobson's last actions was to declare an Auckland Anniversary Day, to mark the anniversary of his arrival in the Bay of Islands.\n\nHobson suffered a second stroke and died on 10 September 1842, prior to being recalled from office. He was buried in the Symonds Street cemetery in Auckland. The Waitakere suburb of Hobsonville is named after him.\n\n\nThe \"Dictionary of New Zealand Biography\" cites:\n\n\n"}
