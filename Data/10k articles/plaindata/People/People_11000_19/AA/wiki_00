The military intelligence under Douba was the single most important security agency in Syria, handling security within the army, but also dealing with the general safeguarding of the regime.\n\nDouba was born to a small landowning family from the Alawite tribe of Matawira, in the village of Qurfays in the Jableh District south of Latakia. He joined the Ba'ath Party in the early 1950s while studying the Holy Land Secondary School in Latakia.\n\nDouba joined the Syrian Army in 1955 and became the deputy head of internal security in Damascus five years later. He served as military attaché at the Syrian embassy in Great Britain between 1964 and 1966, and in Bulgaria between 1967 and 1968. He returned to Syria and became the head of military intelligence for the Latakia region. In November 1970, he was appointed the head of military intelligence for the city of Damascus, where he supported Hafez al-Assad's coup d'état. In 1971, he was made deputy to the head of military intelligence, Hikmat al-Shihabi. Three years later he was made head of this department. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1978, and promoted to general in 1981. Douba took part in suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood revolt in Hama during February 1982. In December 1983, when President Hafez al-Assad was ill, Duba was a member of the committee responsible for governing the state in the interim. In 1985, the Syrian president put him in charge of the Lebanon dossier, along with al-Shihabi and Ghazi Kanaan. Douba was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed deputy chief of the General Staff in January 1993, in addition to his role as head of the military intelligence. In 1999 he was pushed aside by Bashar al-Assad over fears that he could be a rival for the presidency, and was made to retire in February 2000. He is still living in Syria.\nEU Council Regulation 36/2012 places him on a list of persons whose funds are frozen.\n"}

His mother died during childbirth and his father died before he was born. He ran away and went to sea at the age of 13, and changed his name to Alvin. In his early years he worked as a steelworker, steeplejack, high diver, boxer and movie double. He was also a licensed pilot who performed aerial stunts. He served as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Auxiliary Reserve during World War I, serving from May 1918 to September 1921. During the war he served on the USS \"Edgar F. Luckenbach\".\n\nAccording to one account,Kelly climbed his first pole at the age of seven, and at nine he performed a \"human fly\" trick, climbing up the side of a building. He is credited with popularizing the pole-sitting fad after sitting atop a flagpole in 1924, either in response to a dare from a friend or as a publicity stunt to draw customers to a Philadelphia department store. In January of that year he sat on a pole for 13 hours and 13 minutes to publicize a movie.\n\nIn 1926, Kelly set a record by sitting atop a flagpole in St. Louis, Missouri for seven days and one hour; in June 1927, he planned to beat that record by sitting for eight days in Newark, New Jersey. He would end up sitting atop the Newark pole for twelve days, and on a pole in Baltimore's Carlin's Park for 23 days in 1929. In 1930 he set a world record by sitting on a flagpole on top of the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, high, for 49 days and one hour.\n\nAt the height of his fame as a latter-day stylite, he toured 28 cities, charging admission to people who wanted to stand on roofs to see his performance stunts. He also earned an income from endorsements, personal appearances and books about his life. He called himself \"the luckiest fool in the world.\" He once calculated that over two decades he spent 20,613 hours sitting on flagpoles, of which 210 were in sub-freezing weather and 1400 hours in the rain. In one 1927 stunt, he climbed on a pole on a speeding biplane, sitting on a iron crossbar as the plane flew high. \"The New York Times\" reported that \"he didn't get around to hanging by one hand, as he promised he would.\"\n\nWhile pole sitting, Kelly was said to have subsisted mainly on coffee and cigarettes. He learned how to nap while sitting upright, and never was secured by more than a simple leg strap. He once claimed that he doesn't \"take as many chances as a window cleaner.\" Journalist Jay Maeder wrote that \"The newspapers were regularly full of pictures of Shipwreck Kelly, matter-of-factly brushing his teeth and shaving his face, hundreds of feet in the air.\" He said that he was able to sleep while pole sitting by putting his thumbs in holes in the pole shafts. If he swayed, the pain in his thumbs would force him to right himself without waking him up.\n\nHis career began to decline after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and in 1934 he was working as a gigolo at a Broadway dance hall, Roseland, then a \"dime a dance\" hall. Journalist H. Allen Smith found him \"wearing a tail coat and silk hat, sitting on a plush divan.\" By then, Kelly said, 17 people were claiming to be him, because few people knew what he looked like. In the 1930s there was less tolerance for such stunts, and police took a dim view of the disruption it caused. In 1935 he attempted to break his Atlantic City record by sitting on a pole in the Bronx, but was aloft for less than a day before he was arrested as a public nuisance. He only climbed down from the pole after police threatened to cut it down.\n\nOne of his last major public appearances was on October 13, 1939: Kelly celebrated National Donut Dunking Week by sitting on a pole atop the Chanin Building on East 42nd Street in Manhattan and eating 13 donuts dunked into a coffee cup and fed to him while he stood on his head. But by then that kind of work had pretty much dried up, He served in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II.\n\nAccounts vary as to how Kelly acquired his nickname. He claimed to have survived during his lifetime five shipwrecks, two airplane and three automobile accidents, and one train wreck, all without injury. His wife told reporters that he was a survivor of the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\". However, there were only three \"Titanic\" survivors named Kelly and all were women, and \"there is no reason to believe that he ever came near the \"Titanic\".\" He is also said to have gained the nickname as a boxer, because \"he was so often adrift in the ring that the handle became inevitable.\"\n\nHe was described in a 1939 article as a \"stocky, blue-eyed, battered little Irishman\" with \"sparse red hair.\"\n\nKelly's last flagpole-sitting appearance was at an Orange, Texas event sponsored by the Lion's Club on October 4, 1952, one week before his death. Two heart attacks forced him to come down from the 65-foot pole, and the club refused to let him go back up. He retired as a result of the heart attacks, saying \"This is it. I'm through.\"\n\nKelly married an elevator operator, Frances Vivian Steele of Dallas, Texas, whom he met while pole sitting. They had a son, Alvin Kieran Kelly, who became a laborer for the Clyde Beatty Circus. In June 1973, the son was killed at the age of 45 by an elephant during a performance in Tenafly, New Jersey. A female Asiatic elephant lifted him in the air and then put him down and stepped on his chest, crushing him to death before a horrified crowd.\n\nAt the time of his death in October 1952, Kelly had become a \"grizzled old man\" – penniless and all but forgotten. He was by then a widower who had been on home relief for six months, and his son was in the U.S. Army overseas. He had been suffering from an asthmatic heart and hardening of the arteries.\n\nKelly died on October 11, 1952 when he was struck by a car while walking on Manhattan's West 51st Street, near the rooming house where he lived and not far from his birthplace. For a time his body was unclaimed at the morgue, but he was buried at Long Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.\n\nBelongings found in Kelly's room included a duffel bag still packed with ropes and flagpole-sitting gear, \"in case any fresh jobs came along.\" At the time of Kelly's death a scrapbook of his exploits was under his arm. He had titled the scrapbook \"The Luckiest Fool on Earth.\"\n"}
{"id": "367704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367704", "title": "Ben Linder", "text": "Ben Linder\n\nBenjamin Ernest \"Ben\" Linder (July 7, 1959 – April 28, 1987), was an American engineer. While working on a small hydroelectric dam in rural northern Nicaragua Linder was killed by the Contras, a loose confederation of rebel groups funded by the U.S. government. Coming at a time when U.S. support for the Contras was already highly controversial, Linder's death made front-page headlines around the world and further polarized opinion in the United States.\n\nThe California-born Linder graduated from Adams High School in Portland, Oregon in 1977. While in College at the University of Washington, Linder enjoyed juggling and was often seen around Seattle riding a unicycle. He graduated in 1983, with a degree in mechanical engineering. He left his Oregon home that summer and moved to Managua, the capital of Nicaragua.\n\nLinder felt inspired by the 1979 Sandinista revolution, and wanted to support its efforts to improve the lives of the country's poorest people. The Reagan administration, however, saw the Sandinistas as a beachhead of Soviet Communism in the Western Hemisphere, and was determined to cripple the revolution. Beginning in 1981, the Central Intelligence Agency secretly trained, armed and supplied thousands of Contra rebels. A major element of the Contras' strategy was to launch attacks on government cooperatives, health clinics and power stations — the very things that most exemplified the improvements that had been brought about by the revolution.\n\nIn 1986, Linder moved from Managua to El Cuá, a village in the Nicaraguan war zone, where he helped form a team to build a hydroelectric plant to bring electricity to the town. While living in El Cuá, he participated in vaccination campaigns, using his talents as a clown, juggler, and unicyclist to entertain the local children, for whom he expressed great affection and concern.\n\nOn 28 April 1987, Linder and two Nicaraguans were killed in a Contra ambush while traveling through the forest to scout out a construction site for a new dam for the nearby village of San José de Bocay. The autopsy showed that Linder had been wounded by a grenade, then shot at point-blank range in the head. The two Nicaraguans — Sergio Hernández and Pablo Rosales — were also killed at close range. Linder was posthumously awarded the Courage of Conscience award on September 26, 1992.\n\nLinder's death quickly inflamed the already-polarized debate inside the United States, with opponents of U.S. policy decrying the use of taxpayers' dollars to finance the killing of an American citizen as well as thousands of Nicaraguan civilians.\n\nThe administration fought back, with White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted in \"The New York Times\" as saying that U.S. citizens working in Nicaragua had \"put themselves in harm's way\". Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, an ardent proponent of the Contra War, echoed that view, saying that Linder should have known better than to be in a combat zone.\n\nLinder's mother Elisabeth, in Nicaragua for her son's funeral, said, \nMy son was brutally murdered for bringing electricity to a few poor people in northern Nicaragua. He was murdered because he had a dream and because he had the courage to make that dream come true. ... Ben told me the first year that he was here, and this is a quote, \"It's a wonderful feeling to work in a country where the government's first concern is for its people, for all of its people.\"\n\nDuring a Congressional hearing in May 1987, some defenders of U.S. policy in Nicaragua responded, launching personal attacks on Linder's family and other witnesses. The \"Village Voice\" reported one exchange between Republican Congressman Connie Mack of Florida and Elisabeth Linder, who had just given emotional testimony about her son's work and motivations. Mack accused Mrs. Linder of using her grief \"to politicize this situation\", adding, \"I don't want to be tough on you, but I really feel you have asked for it.\" \n\nThe death of Linder, coming as Congressional hearings investigated the Iran-Contra Affair, fueled the debate in the U.S. over the covert war in Nicaragua. The next year, Congress refused to renew aid to the Contras. But the civil war, conscription into the army, the collapse of the economy, and the curtailment of civil liberties in the mid-1980s all combined to cause the defeat of the FSLN government in February 1990 elections.\n\nIn July 1996, American journalist Paul Berman published an article in \"The New Yorker\" featuring an interview with a man who claimed to have killed Linder. Linder's parents and their lawyers publicly denounced the article and disputed the veracity of the man Berman interviewed. In 2001 journalist Joan Kruckewitt, who lived in Nicaragua from 1983 to 1991 and covered the war between the Sandinistas and the Contras for ABC Radio, wrote a book entitled \"The Death of Ben Linder\" giving a more sympathetic portrait of Linder's life, work, and death.\n\nThe song \"Fragile\" on Sting's 1987 album, \"...Nothing Like the Sun\", is a tribute to Ben Linder. Singer-songwriter Dean Stevens wrote and recorded \"The Children Knew Ben\" on his 1989 CD, Seeds, for Volcano Records. The 1990 book \"Animal Dreams\" by Barbara Kingsolver is also dedicated to his memory, as was the (now closed) Ben Linder Cafe in Leon, Nicaragua, which was adorned with his photo and memories of his life's work.\n\n\n\n"}

The crimes were committed over a period of 59 days between February and April 1991 in the children's ward at Grantham and Kesteven Hospital, Lincolnshire, where Allitt was employed as a State Enrolled Nurse. She administered large doses of insulin to at least two victims and a large air bubble was found in the body of another, but police were unable to establish how all the attacks were carried out. In May 1993, at Nottingham Crown Court, she received thirteen life sentences for the crimes. Mr. Justice Latham, sentencing, told Allitt that she was \"a serious danger\" to others and was unlikely ever to be considered safe enough to be released. She is detained at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.\n\nBeverley Allitt was born on 4 October 1968 and grew up in the village of Corby Glen, near the town of Grantham. She had two sisters and a brother. Her father, Richard, worked in an off-licence, and her mother as a school cleaner. Allitt attended Charles Read Secondary Modern School, having failed the test to enter Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. She would often volunteer for baby-sitting jobs and left school at the age of 16, taking a course in nursing at Grantham College.\n\n\n\nAllitt had attacked thirteen children, four fatally, over a 59-day period before she was brought up on charges for her crimes. It was only following the death of Peck that medical staff became suspicious of the number of cardiac arrests on the children's ward and police were called in. It was found that Allitt was the only nurse on duty for all the attacks on the children and she also had access to the drugs.\n\nFour of Allitt's victims had died. She was charged with four counts of murder, eleven counts of attempted murder and eleven counts of causing grievous bodily harm. Allitt entered pleas of not guilty to all charges. On 28 May 1993 she was found guilty on each charge and sentenced to thirteen concurrent terms of life imprisonment, which she is serving at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.\n\nOn 6 December 2007, Mr Justice Stanley Burnton, sitting in the High Court of Justice, London, confirmed that Allitt must serve the original minimum sentence of thirty years. It was reported that some families of Allitt's victims had previously mistakenly believed that her minimum tariff had been set at forty years.\n\nAllitt's motives have never been fully explained. According to one theory, she showed symptoms of factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome or Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This controversial disorder is described as involving a pattern of abuse in which a perpetrator ascribes to, or physically falsifies illnesses in, someone under their care to attract attention to themselves.\n\nIn 2005, the BBC made a dramatisation of the story, \"Angel of Death\", in which Charlie Brooks played Allitt. Allitt's story was depicted in episodes of the true crime documentaries \"Crimes That Shook Great Britain\", \"Born To Kill?\", \"Evil Up Close\", and \"Nurses Who Kill\".\n\n"}

Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album \"TheFutureEmbrace\" in 2005 and a collection of poetry (\"Blinking with Fists\") before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nThe new version of The Smashing Pumpkins, consisting of Corgan and a revolving lineup, has released and toured new albums extensively since 2007. In October 2017, he released his first solo album in over a decade, \"Ogilala\".\n\nIn 2011, Corgan entered the world of professional wrestling, founding Chicago-based Resistance Pro Wrestling. He later joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (now known as Impact Wrestling) in 2015, becoming its president in August 2016. After leaving TNA in November 2016, Corgan purchased the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), gaining its ownership in October 2017.\n\nWilliam Patrick Corgan, Jr. was born at Columbus Hospital in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood on March 17, 1967 as the oldest son of William Corgan Sr., a blues/rock guitarist, and Martha Louise Maes Corgan Lutz. He was raised Catholic. His parents had one more son, Ricky, before divorcing in 1970. His father was soon remarried to a flight attendant, and Corgan and his brother went to live with them in Glendale Heights, Illinois. During this time, Corgan alleges that his stepmother physically and emotionally abused him. Corgan also developed a protective bond with his younger paternal half-brother, who had special needs as a child. When Corgan's father and stepmother separated, all three boys would live alone with their stepmother, with both of Corgan's birth parents living separately within an hour's drive.\n\nCorgan, who grew much faster than his fellow students, was a strong athlete in elementary school. In addition to being a member of his Marquardt Middle School baseball team, he collected baseball cards (amassing over 10,000) and listened to every Chicago Cubs game. However, by the time he began attending Glenbard North High School in Carol Stream, Illinois, he had become only an average athlete. He decided to start playing guitar when he went over to a friend's house and saw his friend's Flying V. Corgan gave his savings to his father, who bought him a used Les Paul knock-off. Corgan Sr. steered his son stylistically, encouraging him to listen to Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix, but offered little other support, and the younger Corgan taught himself to play the instrument. His musical interests in his formative years included hard rock like \"Guts\"-era John Cale, heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, and mainstream rock like Queen, Boston, ELO, Rush, and Cheap Trick. In high school, Corgan discovered alternative rock through Bauhaus and The Cure.\n\nCorgan performed in a string of bands in high school, and graduated as an honor student. Despite grant and scholarship offers from a number of schools, and a tuition fund left by his grandmother, Corgan decided to pursue music full-time. Not finding the Chicago music scene to his liking, he moved from Chicago to St. Petersburg, Florida in 1985 with his first major band, The Marked (so named for the conspicuous birthmarks of both Corgan and drummer Ron Roesing). Not finding success in St. Petersburg, the band dissolved; Corgan moved back to Chicago to live with his father.\n\nCorgan performed with Wayne Static in Static's first band, Deep Blue Dream, in 1987/88.\n\nUpon his return to Chicago, Corgan had already devised his next project – a band that would be called The Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan met guitarist James Iha while working in a record store, and the two began recording demos, which Corgan describes as \"gloomy little goth-pop records.\" He then met bassist D'arcy Wretzky after a local show, arguing with her about a band that had just played, The Dan Reed Network. Soon after, the Smashing Pumpkins were formed. The trio began to play together at local clubs with only a drum machine for percussion. To secure a show at the Metro in Chicago, the band recruited drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, and played for the first time as a quartet on October 5, 1988.\nThe addition of Chamberlin drove the band in a heavier direction almost immediately. On the band's inaugural album, \"Gish\" (1991), the band integrated psychedelic rock and heavy metal into their sound. \"Gish\" fared better than expected, but the follow-up, \"Siamese Dream\", released on Virgin Records in 1993, became a multi-platinum hit. The band became known for internal drama during this period, with Corgan frequently characterized in the music press as a \"control freak\" due to rumors that Corgan played all the guitar and bass parts on \"Siamese Dream\" (a rumor that Corgan later confirmed as true). Despite this, the album was well received by critics, and the songs \"Today,\" \"Cherub Rock, and \"Disarm\" became smash hits.\n\nThe band's 1995 follow up effort, the double album \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\", was even more successful, spawning a string of hit singles. According to Jon Pareles from \"The New York Times\", Corgan wanted to \"lose himself and find himself...\" in this album. The album was nominated for seven Grammy awards that year, and would eventually be certified ten times platinum in the United States. The song \"1979\" was Corgan's biggest hit to date, reaching No. 1 on \"Billboard\"'s modern rock and mainstream rock charts. Their appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" on November 11, 1995, to promote this material (their second appearance on the show overall) was also the television debut appearance of Corgan's shaved head, which he has maintained consistently ever since.\n\nOn July 12, 1996, touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin died in a Manhattan hotel room of a heroin overdose after he and Chamberlin used the drug together. Chamberlin was later arrested on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. The Smashing Pumpkins made the decision to fire Chamberlin and continue as a trio. This shakeup, coupled with Corgan going through a divorce and the death of his mother, influenced the somber mood of the band's next album, 1998's \"Adore\". Featuring a darker, more subdued and heavily electronic sound at a time when alternative rock was declining in mainstream cachet, \"Adore\" divided both critics and fans, resulting in a significant decrease in album sales (it sold 1.3 million discs in the US).\n\nChamberlin was reunited with the band in 1999. In 2000, they released \"Machina/The Machines of God\", a concept album on which the band deliberately played to their public image. Critics were again divided, and sales were lower than ever; \"Machina\" is the second lowest-selling commercially released Smashing Pumpkins album to date, with U.S. sales of 583,000 units up to 2005. During the recording for \"Machina\", Wretzky quit the band and was replaced for the upcoming tour by former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur. In 2000 the band announced they would break up at the end of the year, and soon after released \"Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music\" free over the Internet. The Smashing Pumpkins played their last show on December 2, 2000, at the Cabaret Metro.\n\nFollowing a brief stint touring with New Order in the summer, Corgan reunited with Chamberlin to form the band Zwan with Corgan's old friend Matt Sweeney in late 2001. According to Neil Strauss of New York Times, during his few live performances with the band, Corgan says \"is still a work in progress.\" The lineup was completed with guitarist David Pajo and bassist Paz Lenchantin. The band had two distinct incarnations, the primary approach being an upbeat rock band with a three-guitar-driven sound, the second, a folk and gospel inspired acoustic side with live strings. The quintet performed throughout 2002, and their debut album, \"Mary Star of the Sea\", was released in early 2003 to generally positive reviews. In the midst of their supporting tour for the album, mounting conflict between Corgan and Chamberlin, and the other band members led to the cancellation of the rest of the tour as the band entered an apparent hiatus, formally announcing a breakup in September 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky \"a mean spirited drug addict,\" and criticizing his former Zwan bandmates' fixation with \"indie cred\" and calling them \"filthy\", opportunistic, and selfish.\n\nOn September 17, 2003, Billy first presented his poetry at the Art Institute of Chicago's Rubloff Auditorium. In late 2004, Corgan published \"Blinking with Fists\", a book of poetry. Despite mixed reviews, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. Around this time, he began posting autobiographical writings online under the title \"The Confessions of Billy Corgan\".\n\nAlso in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, \"TheFutureEmbrace\", co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. Released on June 21, 2005, through Reprise Records, it garnered mixed reviews from the press and only sold 69,000 copies. Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. Prior to recording \"TheFutureEmbrace\", Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic \"ChicagoSongs\" project, which have yet to be released.\n\nIn 2005, Corgan took out a full-page ad in Chicago's two major newspapers (\"The Chicago Tribune\" and \"The Chicago Sun-Times\") revealing his desire to re-form the Smashing Pumpkins. Several days later, Jimmy Chamberlin accepted Billy Corgan's offer for a reunion.\n\nOn April 20, 2006, the band's official website confirmed that the group was indeed reuniting. The re-formed Smashing Pumpkins went into studio for much of 2006 and early 2007, and performed its first show in seven years on May 22, 2007, with new members Ginger Pooley (bass) and Jeff Schroeder (guitar) replacing Wretzky and Iha. The new album, titled \"Zeitgeist,\" was released in the United States on July 10, 2007, and debuted at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" charts. Corgan and the rest of the Pumpkins toured extensively throughout 2007 and 2008, also releasing the EP \"American Gothic\" and the singles \"G.L.O.W.\" and \"Superchrist\". Chamberlin left the band in March 2009, and Corgan elected to continue under the name.\n\nIn summer 2009 Corgan formed the band Spirits in the Sky to play a tribute concert to the late Sky Saxon of the Seeds. He then toured with the band, composed of ex-Catherine member and \"Superchrist\" producer Kerry Brown, the late Electric Prunes bassist Mark Tulin, Strawberry Alarm Clock keyboardist Mark Weitz, frequent Corgan collaborator Linda Strawberry, flautist Kevin Dippold, \"Superchrist\" violinist Ysanne Spevack, saxist Justin Norman, new Pumpkins drummer Mike Byrne, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, playing covers and new Pumpkins material at several clubs in California. At the end of the tour, Corgan, Byrne, Tulin, and Brown headed back to Chicago to begin work on the new Smashing Pumpkins album, \"Teargarden by Kaleidyscope.\" The lineup at the time which included new bassist Nicole Fiorentino, toured through much of 2010, then spent 2011 recording the \"album-within-an-album\" \"Oceania\" and mounting tours of the United States and Europe. However, Byrne and Fiorentino would later leave the band in 2014.\n\nIn April Corgan announced a new solo record of \"experimental\" recordings he made in 2007, via the Smashing Pumpkins' website. The album, which he titled \"AEGEA,\" was slated to be released exclusively on vinyl, with 250 copies being made; 200 of those copies would be sold online, through Madame Zuzu's Tea House's online store, 30 would be sold at Madame Zuzu's Tea House itself, 10 would be sold by way of famed Vintage Vinyl, in Evanston, Illinois, and 10 were set aside for promotion. The album was released on May 15.\n\nOn July 25, 2014, Corgan announced that the tapes from his \"Siddhartha\" show from March 2014 were being transferred for sale, much in the vein of \"AEGEA.\" The set was expected to contain between 5 and 6 discs.\n\nDuring the summer 2014, Corgan recorded The Smashing Pumpkins's tenth studio album, \"Monuments to an Elegy,\" with Tommy Lee and Jeff Schroeder. The album was released in early December 2014.\n\nIn September 2015, Corgan started a blog of vintage photographs that he himself curated, and which he called \"People and Their Cars.\" The website also included an email listing for the blog, titled \"The Red Border Club.\" This list was to be used for information on upcoming People and Their Cars and \"Hexestential\" books and merchandise, along with access to additional images.\n\nOn September 8, 2016, Corgan announced, in a Facebook live video, that he had recorded a new solo album with producer Rick Rubin, and it would consist of 12 or 13 tracks. He described work on the album as being near completion, though a release date was not given.\n\nOn August 22, 2017, he announced the solo album, giving its title as \"Ogilala.\"\n\nOn February 16, 2018, Corgan announced a reunion tour for The Smashing Pumpkins. The lineup consists of himself, James Iha, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Jeff Schroeder. It is rumored that former bassist D'arcy Wretzky was not a part of the lineup due to unresolved tension between her and Corgan. However, she has stated that after offering her a contract, Corgan retracted it, saying that \"we also have to balance the forces at play... there is no room for error.\" After Wretzky released text messages between her and Corgan, a feud ensued, which each party attacking with biting remarks.\n\nCorgan has struggled with depression for much of his life, and has endured bouts of self-harm, obsessive-compulsive disorder and suicidal ideation. Corgan attributes these problems to the abuse he endured as a child as well as personal anxieties and other issues. Corgan has since become an advocate for abuse support networks.\n\nHis mother Martha died in December 1996. The song \"For Martha\", from \"Adore\", was written in her memory. In the early 2000s Corgan named his label Martha's Music after her as well. A picture of Martha as a little girl sitting on a fake moon at Riverview Park is featured on the flipside of the \"Siamese Dream\" booklet.\n\nCorgan is an avid sports fan. A fan of the Chicago Cubs, he is an occasional commentator on that team for WXRT DJ Lin Brehmer, and sporadically, in interviews. He has appeared at Cubs games many times, occasionally throwing the ceremonial first pitch or singing \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\". He was a devoted fan of the Bulls and Blackhawks in the 1990s, and became personal friends with Dennis Rodman and Chris Chelios.\n\nHe is a fan of professional wrestling and self-described \"wrestlemaniac\", and appeared at an Extreme Championship Wrestling event wielding an acoustic guitar as a weapon. In 2008, the Pumpkins song \"Doomsday Clock\" was used by Ring of Honor for promotional videos. On April 26, 2010, Corgan appeared live on the SIRIUS Satellite Radio program \"Right After Wrestling\" with Arda Ocal to discuss his love for pro wrestling and the importance of unique theme songs for characters. On August 26, 2010, Corgan took part in a professional wrestling storyline with wrestlers from the Mexican promotion AAA during a concert for MTV World Stage. He also ran his own professional wrestling company called Resistance Pro based in Chicago. As far as other entertainment, Corgan once commented that all he watches on TV are \"sports and Three Stooges.\" In March 2008, he was spotted in the crowd at the final day of the cricket test match between New Zealand and England in Wellington. In early 2014, it was rumoured through many wrestling news sites that AMC were picking Resistance Pro up for a backstage and in-ring look at Corgan's promotion. In May 2017, it was announced Corgan through his production company, Lightning One, had agreed to purchase the National Wrestling Alliance as part of a deal that was eventually finalized on October 1.\n\nHe incorporates elements of Catholicism and Buddhism into his spiritual philosophy even though he has not publicly aligned himself with any one faith. In 2009, he launched Everything From Here to There, an interfaith website that is devoted to \"Mind-Body-Soul\" integration. He mentions praying each morning and night to be able to see through Jesus Christ's eyes and feel with his heart. A recent analysis of the symbolism of Corgan's lyrics considered the blend of beliefs he has cited in various interviews, which include various ideas about religion, multiple dimensions and psychic phenomena. He has claimed to experience multiple encounters witnessing people with the ability to shapeshift.\n\nIn 1993, he married his longtime on-again, off-again girlfriend Chris Fabian, an art conservator and artist. They were married at a small ceremony at his house in Wrigleyville. Corgan and Fabian separated in late 1995, and divorced in 1997. Corgan refused to discuss the subject in interviews, saying \"There is not and will not be any public record on my marriage – that's one thing I have to draw lines around.\" He nevertheless described the circumstances of his marriage in his online \"Confessions\" in 2005.\n\nIn late 1995, he started dating photographer Yelena Yemchuk, who later contributed to several Smashing Pumpkins videos and album art. He continued to date Yemchuk until around 2004. According to Corgan, his breakup with her contributed to the themes of his 2005 solo release \"TheFutureEmbrace\". In 2008, Corgan said, \"I've had a bad marriage and seven bad girlfriends in a row\", a perspective he attributes to his dedication to music.\n\nIn 2005, Corgan dated musician Emilie Autumn for a number of months. The pair collaborated on multiple occasions during this time, with Autumn providing vocals and violin on his solo album and costume for a supporting music video.\n\nIn early 2006, Corgan moved in with Courtney Love and her daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. According to Love, he had his own wing in her new Hollywood Hills mansion. Two years later, Love criticized Corgan publicly over the latter's alleged refusal to attend Frances' sweet 16 birthday party. In March 2010, Corgan stated in an interview in reference about Love \"I have no interest in supporting her in any way, shape or form. You can't throw enough things down the abyss with a person like that\" and said he parted ways with her. Shortly after, when Hole's \"Nobody's Daughter\" was released, Corgan unleashed on Twitter a set of anger-filled words against her in reference to including two songs he wrote, \"Samantha\" and \"How Dirty Girls Get Clean\", that ended up on the new album without his permission. Love then wrote an apology to him on her Facebook account, but the feud continued nevertheless. Corgan took to Twitter again in six parts, attacking her again. Love responded to Corgan on Twitter, saying \"All i am is nice about you so if you wanna be mean be mean i don't feel anything. i have too much to feel dear.\"\n\nIn 2009, Corgan was linked with pop star Jessica Simpson. He started dating Jessica Origliasso from The Veronicas in 2010, and remained in a relationship with her until early June 2012 when the pair broke up. \"It's one of those things. It's really difficult when you spend so much time apart\", said Origliasso of the split.\n\nCorgan has been a pescetarian since 2013, which he has mentioned on the official Smashing Pumpkins website. In 2017, while filming the documentary \"Thirty Days,\" Corgan stated he is now vegan and gluten free.\n\nIn 2012, he opened a tea house in his native Highland Park called Madame Zuzu's Tea House.\n\nCorgan's girlfriend Chloe Mendel gave birth to their son named Augustus Juppiter Corgan on November 16, 2015. On October 2, 2018, their second child, a daughter, Philomena Clementine Corgan was born.\n\nIn 2011 Corgan formed a Chicago-based independent wrestling promotion called Resistance Pro. Two years later, in 2013, he starred in a commercial for Walter E. Smithe Furniture, using the platform to promote his wrestling company.\n\nIn March 2014 it was reported that Corgan was in discussions with American television channel AMC to develop an unscripted reality series about Resistance Pro. The premise being a behind-the-scenes look at the promotion as Corgan \"takes over creative direction for the independent wrestling company.\" The show was given the green light by AMC, under the working title of \"Untitled Billy Corgan Wrestling Project,\" the same month.\n\nIn April 2015 Corgan was announced as the new Senior Producer of Creative and Talent Development for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where his role was to \"develop characters and create story lines\", which he has called \"a dream come true.\" In August 2016, Corgan took over as the promotion's new president.\n\nIn November 2016 Corgan had left TNA after disputes about not being paid on time, and subsequently, Anthem Sports & Entertainment Corp and Impact Ventures, parent company of TNA Impact Wrestling, announced that Anthem has provided a credit facility to TNA to fund operations.\n\nOn November 11, Corgan signed a settlement with Anthem – TNA and Anthem announced that they would be repaying TNA's loan from Corgan.\n\nNewly appointed TNA/Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Matt Hardy \"Broken\" gimmick to Jeremy Borash, Dava Lagana and Billy Corgan. While Borash specifically had the most input into the gimmick of the three aside from Matt, the Hardy family deny that Borash was the sole person behind the gimmick.\n\nOn May 1, 2017, it was reported that Corgan had agreed to purchase the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), including its name, rights, trademarks and championship belts. The purchase was confirmed by NWA president Bruce Tharpe later that same day. Corgan's ownership took effect on October 1, 2017.\n\nCorgan said after the 2008 election, \"I'm very proud of my country right now for doing the right thing.\" He has since said that he has been disappointed with Barack Obama's presidency, and lacks faith in both major political parties. In 2009, he posted a transcript of a webcast by political activist Lyndon LaRouche to the official Smashing Pumpkins forum. In 2016, he characterized progressive political campaigners as \"social justice warriors\", compared them to Maoists, cult members and the Ku Klux Klan, and called them a threat to freedom of speech. In 2018, Corgan revealed that he is a \"free-market libertarian capitalist\" and added that he has not voted since 1992 when he voted for Bill Clinton.\n\nOn March 10, 2009, Corgan testified in front of Congress on behalf of the musicFIRST Coalition. Corgan spoke in favor of H.R. 848, the Performance Rights Act, which gives musicians and artists their share of compensation when their music is played on music radio stations.\n\nCorgan has in recent years increasingly espoused conspiracy theories, voiced his admiration for radio host Alex Jones and frequently appeared as a guest on the latter's radio show, where he has endorsed conspiracy theories such as the chemtrail conspiracy theory, and the connection between vaccines and autism, that swine influenza was an \"Obama conspiracy\" and \"propaganda\" and decried the \"emasculation\" of men in contemporary society.\n\nIn addition to performing, Corgan has produced albums for Ric Ocasek, The Frogs, and Catherine. He shared songwriting credit on several songs on Hole's 1998 album \"Celebrity Skin\"; the title track became Corgan's second No. 1 modern rock hit. He also acted as a consultant for Marilyn Manson during the recording of the album \"Mechanical Animals\". He has produced three soundtracks for the movies \"Ransom\" (1996), \"Stigmata\" (1999) and \"Spun\" (2002) in which he appeared as a doctor.\n\nCorgan appeared at the 1996 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremonies. He inducted one of his biggest musical influences, Pink Floyd. He played acoustic guitar during the ceremony with Pink Floyd, when they performed their song \"Wish You Were Here\".\n\nIn particular, Corgan guided and collaborated with three bands in the 2000s—Breaking Benjamin (during sessions for 2004's \"We Are Not Alone\"), Taproot (for \"Blue-Sky Research\", 2005), and Sky Saxon.\n\nIn 2010, Corgan claimed co-writing credit (with ex-girlfriend Courtney Love) on at least two of the songs on Hole's final album \"Nobody's Daughter\" and tried to assert a right of approval before the album could be released. Corgan had helped develop the album during its early stages. The album was released without the writing controversy ever being litigated or publicly resolved.\n\nCorgan appeared as a guest vocalist on the song \"Loki Cat\" on Jimmy Chamberlin's first solo album, \"Life Begins Again\", and Chamberlin played drums for the song \"DIA\" on Corgan's solo debut, where Robert Smith from The Cure teamed up with Corgan to do a cover of the Bee Gees' \"To Love Somebody\". In 2007, Corgan provided vocals on the Scorpions' song \"The Cross\", on their album \"\". In 2010 Corgan featured on Ray Davies' album See My Friends on the album's closer, a mash-up of the Kinks songs \"All Day and All of the Night\" and \"Destroyer\". He also contributed his guitar work on \"Did You Miss Me\" by The Veronicas. Corgan has also collaborated with Tony Iommi, Blindside, David Bowie (singing \"All the Young Dudes\" with Bowie at Bowie's 50th birthday party), New Order and Marianne Faithfull.\n\nWhen asked in a 1994 \"Rolling Stone\" interview about his influences, Corgan replied:\n\nCorgan wrote six articles for \"Guitar World\" in 1995, and his solos for \"Cherub Rock\" and \"Geek U.S.A.\" were included on their list of the top guitar solos of all time. AllMusic said \"Starla\" \"proves that Corgan was one of the finest (and most underrated) rock guitarists of the '90s\", while \"Rolling Stone\" called him and his Smashing Pumpkins bandmates \"ruthless virtuosos\". His solo for \"Soma\" was No. 24 on \"Rolling Stone\"&apos;s list of the top guitar solos. He is a fan of Eddie Van Halen and interviewed him in 1996 for \"Guitar World\". Other guitarists Corgan rates highly include Uli Jon Roth, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Leslie West, Dimebag Darrell and Robin Trower.\n\nHis bass playing, which has featured on nearly every Smashing Pumpkins album, was influenced by post-punk figures like Peter Hook and Simon Gallup.\n\nCorgan has praised Radiohead, saying \"if they're not the best band in the world, then they're one of the best\". He is also a fan of Pantera. Other favorites include Depeche Mode, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Rush, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Queen, Electric Light Orchestra, Dinosaur Jr., Breaking Benjamin, My Bloody Valentine, and Spiritualized. Corgan stated in 1997 that upon hearing the U2 song 'New Years Day', at 16, \"[U2] quickly became the most important band in the world to me.\" Corgan particularly went out of his way to praise Rush in his interview for \"\", a documentary on the band, where he criticized mainstream reviewers for consciously marginalizing the band and their influence, and highlighted the fact that many of his musical peers were influenced by Rush.\n\nHe has listed his artistic influences as William S. Burroughs, Pablo Picasso, Jimi Hendrix, Jack Kerouac, and Philip K. Dick.\n\nCorgan played (during the \"Gish\"-\"Siamese Dream\" era) a customized '57 Reissue Fender Stratocaster equipped with three Fender Lace Sensor pickups (the Lace Sensor Blue in the neck position, the Lace Sensor Silver in the middle position, and the Lace Sensor Red at the bridge position). It also has a five-position pickup selector switch which he installed himself. This battered Strat became his number one guitar by default. He owned a '74 Strat that was stolen shortly after \"Gish\" was completed.\n\nCorgan also used a wide variety of guitars on \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\". On \"Where Boys Fear to Tread\", Corgan used a Les Paul Junior Reissue, and on \"Tonight Tonight\" he used a '72 Gibson ES-335. He is also known to use a '74 Strat which has since been painted baby blue. That guitar was used on the recordings for \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\" and also \"Muzzle\", because the heavier wood gave it the basic Strat sound with a bit more bottom.\n\nDuring the recording and tour of the album \"Zeitgeist\", Corgan used a Schecter C-1 EX baritone, finished in black with Tony Iommi signature pickups.\n\nCorgan also endorsed Reverend Guitars in his Zwan era, most notably playing a Reverend Slingshot.\n\nIn 2008 Corgan released to the market his own Fender Stratocaster. This new guitar was made to Corgan's exact specs to create his famous mid-'90s buzzsaw tone; the instrument features three DiMarzio pickups (two custom for this instrument), a string-through hardtail bridge and a satin nitrocellulose lacquer finish. When playing live, he uses both his signature Strats as well as two other Fender Strats, one in red with a white pick guard and one in silver-grey with a black pick guard; a Gibson Tony Iommi signature SG; and his Schecter C-1 (only used on the \"Zeitgeist\" song \"United States\").\n\nA video called 'Stompland' on the official Smashing Pumpkins YouTube channel is informative on Corgan's choice of effects pedals. In the video he reveals an extensive collection of pedals used throughout his career with the Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan's tone is often characterized by his use of fuzz pedals, particularly vintage versions of the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff \n\nIn 2016 Reverend Guitars released the BC-1 Billy Corgan signature guitar featuring Railhammer Billy Corgan signature pickups.\n\nThe Reverend Billy Corgan Signature Terz was launched at the 2018 NAMM show—an electric version of a 19th-century instrument that is played as if the guitar is capoed at the third fret, and tuned G-g standard. Corgan often uses the capo at the third fret and asked for a higher-register guitar.\n\nCorgan is noted for having used Marshall and Diezel amps. He has also used modular preamps based off many different amps in conjunction with Mesa Boogie poweramps. The preamps were built custom built by Salvation Mods.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "181376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181376", "title": "Bret Easton Ellis", "text": "Bret Easton Ellis\n\nBret Easton Ellis (born March 7, 1964) is an American author, screenwriter, and short story writer. His works have been translated into 27 languages. He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack, which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney. He is a self-proclaimed satirist whose trademark technique, as a writer, is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style. Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common, recurring characters.\n\nAt the age of 21, his first novel, the controversial bestseller \"Less Than Zero\" (1985), was published by Simon & Schuster. His third novel, \"American Psycho\" (1991) was his most successful; upon release, the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic. Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster, the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year. In later years, Ellis' novels have become increasingly metafictional. \"Lunar Park\" (2005), a pseudo-memoir and ghost story, received positive reviews. \"Imperial Bedrooms\" (2010), marketed as a sequel to \"Less Than Zero\", continues in this vein.\n\nFour of Ellis's works have been made into films. \"Less Than Zero\" was adapted for screen in 1987 with a film of the same name, however the film bore little resemblance to the novel. Mary Harron's adaptation of \"American Psycho\" was released to generally positive reviews in 2000. Roger Avary's 2002 adaptation \"The Rules of Attraction\" made modest box office returns. 2008's \"The Informers\", based on Ellis's collection of short stories, was critically panned. Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film \"The Canyons\".\n\nEllis was born in Los Angeles and raised in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. His father, Robert Martin Ellis, was a property developer, and his mother, Dale (Dennis) Ellis, was a homemaker. They divorced in 1982. Ellis stated, during the initial release of his third novel \"American Psycho,\" that his father was abusive, and he became the basis of that book's best-known character Patrick Bateman. Later, Ellis claimed the character was not in fact based on his father, but on Ellis himself, saying that all of his work came from a specific place of pain he was going through in his life during the writing of each of his books. Ellis claims that while his family life growing up was somewhat difficult due to the divorce, he mostly had an \"idyllic\" California childhood.\n\nEllis was educated at The Buckley School in California; he then attended Bennington College in Vermont, where he originally studied music then gradually gravitated to writing, which had been one of his passions since childhood. There he met and befriended Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem, who both would later become published writers. Bennington College was also where Ellis completed a novel he had been working on for many years. That book, \"Less Than Zero\", went on to be published while Ellis was just 21 and still in college, thus propelling him to instant fame.\n\nAfter the success and controversy of \"Less Than Zero\" in 1985, Ellis became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer Jay McInerney: the two became known as the \"toxic twins\" for their highly publicized late night debauchery.\n\nEllis became a pariah for a time following the release of \"American Psycho\" (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its 2000 movie adaptation. It has now been regarded as Ellis' \"magnum opus\", garnering acknowledgement from a number of academics. \"The Informers\" (1994) was offered to his publisher during \"Glamorama\"'s long writing history. Ellis wrote a screenplay for \"The Rules of Attraction\"s film adaptation, which was not used. Ellis records a fictionalized version of his life story up until this point in the first chapter of \"Lunar Park\" (2005). After the death of his lover Michael Wade Kaplan, Ellis was spurred to finish \"Lunar Park\" and inflected it with a new tone of wistfulness.\n\nEllis was approached by young screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki to adapt \"The Informers\" into a film; the script they co-wrote was cut from 150 to 94 pages and taken from Jarecki to give to Australian director Gregor Jordan, whose light-on-humor vision of the film was met with unanimously negative reviews when the film was released in 2009.\n\nDespite setbacks as a screenwriter, Ellis teamed up with acclaimed director Gus Van Sant in 2009 to adapt the \"Vanity Fair\" article \"The Golden Suicides\" into a film of the same name, depicting the paranoid final days and suicides of celebrity artists Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake. The film, as of 2014, has never been made. When Van Sant appeared on \"The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast\" on February 12, 2014, he stated that he was never attached to the project as a screenwriter or a director, merely a consultant, claiming that the material seemed too tricky for him to properly render on screen. Ellis and Van Sant mentioned that Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling were approached to star as Duncan and Blake, respectively. Ellis confirmed that he and his producing partner Braxton Pope are still working on the project, with Ellis revisiting the screenplay from time to time. As of April 2014, radical filmmaker Gaspar Noé was officially attached to direct if the film went into production, but he proved troublesome to work with due to his erratic behavior.\n\nIn 2010, Ellis released \"Imperial Bedrooms\", the sequel to his début novel. Ellis wrote it following his return to LA and fictionalizes his work on the film adaptation of \"The Informers\", from the perspective of Clay. Positive reviews felt it was a culmination of the themes begun respectively in \"Less Than Zero,\" \"American Psycho\" and \"Lunar Park\". Negative reviews noted the novel's rehashed themes and listless writing.\n\nEllis expressed interest in writing the screenplay for the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" film adaptation. He discussed casting with his followers, and even mentioned meeting with the film's producers, as well as noting he felt it went well. The job eventually went to Kelly Marcel, Patrick Marber and Mark Bomback.\n\nIn 2012, Ellis wrote the screenplay for the independent film \"The Canyons\" and helped raise money for its production. The film was released in 2013 and although critically panned, was a small financial success, with the performance of Lindsay Lohan in the lead role earning some positive reviews.\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 2002 whether he was gay, Ellis explained that he does not identify himself as gay or straight; he is comfortable being thought of as homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual, and enjoys playing with his persona, identifying variously as gay, straight, and bisexual to different people over the years.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, the author suggested that his reluctance to definitively label his sexuality is for \"artistic reasons\". He commented: \"if people knew that I was straight, they'd read [my books] in a different way. If they knew I was gay, \"Psycho\" would be read as a different book.\" In an interview with Robert F. Coleman, Ellis said his was an \"indeterminate sexuality,\" that \"any other interviewer out there will get a different answer and it just depends on the mood I am in.\" In a 2011 interview with James Brown, Ellis again stated that his answers to questions about his sexuality have varied from interviewer to interviewer, and he cited an example where his reluctance to refuse the label \"bi\" had him labelled as such by a \"Details\" interviewer. \"I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long,\" he clarified. \"But I still use it, I still say it.\" Responding to Dan Savage's It Gets Better campaign, aimed at preventing suicide among LGBT youth, Ellis tweeted: \"Not to bum everyone out, but can we get a reality check here? It gets worse.\" In a 2012 op-ed for \"The Daily Beast\", while apologizing for a series of controversial tweets, Ellis identified himself as a gay man.\n\n\"Lunar Park\" was dedicated to his lover, Michael Wade Kaplan, and Ellis' father, Robert Ellis, who died in 1992. In one interview, Ellis described feeling a liberation in the completion of the novel that allowed him to come to terms with unresolved issues regarding his father. In the \"author Q&A\" for \"Lunar Park\" on the Random House website, Ellis comments on his relationship with Robert, and says he feels that his father was a \"tough case\" who left him damaged. Having grown older and having \"mellow[ed] out\", Ellis describes how his opinion of his father changed since 15 years ago when writing \"Glamorama\" (in which the central conspiracy concerns the relationship of a father and son). Even earlier in his career, Ellis based the character of Patrick Bateman from \"American Psycho\" on his father. In a 2010 interview, however, he claims to have lied about this explanation. Explaining that \"Patrick Bateman was about me,\" he confesses \"I didn't want to finally own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman, so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street.\" In reality, the book had been \"about me at the time, and I wrote about all my rage and feelings.\" To James Brown, he clarified Bateman was based on \"my father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle; my father wasn't in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to.\"\n\nEllis named his first novel and his latest after two Elvis Costello references: \"Less Than Zero\" and \"Imperial Bedroom\" respectively. Ellis named Bruce Springsteen his \"musical hero\" in a 2010 interview with \"NME\".\n\nEllis's first novel, \"Less Than Zero\", is a tale of disaffected, rich teenagers of Los Angeles written and re-written over a five-year period from Ellis's second year in high school, earlier drafts being \"... more autobiographical and read like teen diaries or journal entries—lots of stuff about the bands I liked, the beach, the Galleria, clubs, driving around, doing drugs, partying\", according to Ellis. The novel was praised by critics and sold well (50,000 copies in its first year). He moved back to New York City in 1987 for the publication of his second novel, \"The Rules of Attraction\" – described by Ellis as \"... an attempt to write the kind of college novel I had always wanted to read and could never find\" – which follows a group of sexually promiscuous college students. Influenced heavily by James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and its stream-of-consciousness narrative technique, \"... Attraction\" sold fairly well, though Ellis admits he felt he had \"fallen off\" after the novel failed to match the success of his debut effort, Ellis reflecting in 2012 \" I was very obsessive, very protective about that book, perhaps overly so.\" His most controversial work is the graphically violent \"American Psycho\", which Ellis states \"...came out of a place of severe alienation and loneliness and self-loathing. I was pursuing a life—you could call it the Gentlemen's Quarterly way of living—that I knew was bullshit, and yet I couldn't seem to help it.\" The book was intended to be published by Simon & Schuster, but they withdrew after external protests from groups such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and many others due to the allegedly misogynistic nature of the book. The novel was later published by Vintage. Some consider this novel, whose protagonist, Patrick Bateman, is both a cartoonishly materialistic yuppie and a serial killer, to be an example of transgressive art. \"American Psycho\" has achieved considerable cult status.\n\nEllis's collection of short stories, \"The Informers\", was published in 1994. It contains vignettes of wayward Los Angeles characters ranging from rock stars to vampires, mostly written while Ellis was in college, and so has more in common with the style of \"Less Than Zero.\" Ellis has said that the stories in \"The Informers\" were collected and released only to fulfill a contractual obligation after discovering that it would take far longer to complete his next novel than he'd intended. After years of struggling with it, Ellis released his fourth novel \"Glamorama\" in 1998. \"Glamorama\" is set in the world of high fashion, following a male model who becomes entangled in a bizarre terrorist organization composed entirely of other models. The book plays with themes of media, celebrity, and political violence, and like its predecessor \"American Psycho\" it uses surrealism to convey a sense of postmodern dread. Although the reactions to the novel were mixed, Ellis holds it in high esteem among his own works: \"... it's probably the best novel I've written and the one that means the most to me. And when I say \"best\"—the wrong word, I suppose, but I'm not sure what else to replace it with—I mean that I'll never have that energy again, that kind of focus sustained for eight years on a single project. I'll never spend that amount of time crafting a book that means that much to me. And I think people who have read all of my work and are fans understand that about Glamorama—it's the one book out of the seven I've published that matters the most.\" Ellis's novel \"Lunar Park\" (2005), uses the form of a celebrity memoir to tell a ghost story about the novelist \"Bret Easton Ellis\" and his chilling experiences in the apparently haunted home he shares with his wife and son. In keeping with his usual style, Ellis mixes absurd comedy with a bleak and violent vision.\n\nIn 2010, Ellis released a follow-up to \"Less Than Zero\" entitled \"Imperial Bedrooms\" (2010). Taking place 25 years after the events of Ellis' debut novel, it combines the postmodernism of \"Lunar Park\" with the unaltered ennui of \"Less Than Zero.\" The book was met with disappointing sales.\n\nFor writing the original screenplay for the Paul Schrader directed film \"The Canyons\", Ellis won the 'Best Screenplay' award at the 14th Melbourne Underground Film Festival, with the film also winning 'Best Foreign Film,' 'Best Foreign Director' for Schrader and 'Best Female Actor' for Lindsay Lohan.\n\nEllis often uses recurring characters and settings. Major characters in one novel may become minor ones in the next, or vice versa. Camden College, a fictional New England liberal arts college, is frequently referenced. It is based on Bennington College, which Ellis himself attended, where he met future novelist Jonathan Lethem and befriended fellow writers Donna Tartt and Jill Eisenstadt. In Tartt's \"The Secret History\" (1992), her version of Bennington is given as \"Hampden College,\" although there are oblique connections between it and Ellis' \"Rules of Attraction.\" Eisenstadt and Lethem, however, use 'Camden' in \"From Rockaway\" (1987) and \"The Fortress of Solitude\" (2003), respectively. Though his three major settings are Vermont, Los Angeles and New York, he doesn't think of these novels as about these places; they are intentionally more universal than that.\n\nCamden is introduced in \"Less Than Zero,\" where it is mentioned that both protagonist Clay and minor character Daniel attend it. In \"The Rules of Attraction\" (1987), where Camden is the setting, Clay (referred to as \"The Guy from L.A.\" before being properly introduced) is a minor character who narrates one chapter; ironically, he longs for the Californian beach, where in Ellis' previous novel he had longed to return to college. On \"the guy from L.A.'s door someone wrote \"Rest in Peace Called\"; R.I.P., or Rip, is Clay's dealer in \"Less Than Zero\"; Clay also says that Blair from \"Less than Zero\" sent him a letter saying she thinks Rip was murdered. Main character Sean Bateman's older brother Patrick narrates one chapter of the novel; he would be the infamous central character of Ellis' next novel, \"American Psycho.\" Ellis includes a reference to Tartt's forthcoming \"Secret History\" in the form of a passing mention of \"that weird Classics group ... probably roaming the countryside sacrificing farmers and performing pagan rituals.\" There is also an allusion to the main character from Eisenstadt's \"From Rockaway.\"\n\nIn \"American Psycho\" (1991), Patrick's brother Sean appears briefly. Paul Denton and Victor Johnson from \"The Rules of Attraction\" are both mentioned; on seeing Paul, Patrick wonders if \"maybe he was on that cruise a long time ago, one night last March. If that's the case, I'm thinking, I should get his telephone number or, better yet, his address.\" Camden is referred to as both Sean's college and the college a minor character named Vanden is going to. Vanden was referred to (but never appeared) in both \"Less Than Zero\" and \"The Rules of Attraction.\" Passages from \"Less Than Zero\" reappear, almost verbatim, here, with Patrick replacing Clay as narrator. Patrick also makes repeated references to Jami Gertz, the actress who portrays Blair in the 1987 film adaptation of \"Less Than Zero.\" Allison Poole from Jay McInerney's 1988 novel \"Story of My Life\" appears as a torture victim of Patrick's. 1994's \"The Informers\" features a much-younger Timothy Price, one of Patrick's co-workers in \"American Psycho,\" who narrates one chapter. One of the central characters, Graham, buys concert tickets from \"Less Than Zero\"s Julian, and his sister Susan goes on to say that Julian sells heroin and is a male prostitute (as shown in \"Zero\"). Alana and Blair from \"Zero\" are also friends of Susan's. Letters to Sean Bateman from a Camden College girl named Anne visiting grandparents in LA comprise the eighth chapter.\n\nPatrick Bateman appears briefly in \"Glamorama\" (1998); \"Glamorama\"'s main characters Victor Ward and Lauren Hynde were first introduced in \"The Rules of Attraction\". As an in-joke reference to Bateman being portrayed by Christian Bale in the then-in-production 2000 film adaptation, the actor himself briefly appears as a background character. The book also includes a spy called Russell who is physically identical to Bale, and at one point in the novel impersonates him. Jaime Fields, who has a major role in the book, was first briefly mentioned by Victor in \"The Rules of Attraction.\" Bertrand, Sean and Mitchell, all from \"The Rules of Attraction,\" appear in Camden flashbacks and several other \"Rules\" characters are referenced. McInerney's Alison Poole makes her second appearance in an Ellis novel as Victor's mistress. \"Lunar Park\" (2005) is not set in the same \"universe\" as Ellis' other novels, but contains a similar multitude of references and allusions. All the author's previous works are heavily referenced, in keeping with the book-within-a-book structure. Jay McInerney cameos. Donald Kimball from \"American Psycho\" questions Ellis on a series of \"American Psycho\"-inspired murders, Mitchell Allen from \"Rules\" lives next door to and went to college with Ellis (Ellis even recalls his affair with Paul Denton, alluded to in \"Rules\"), and Ellis recalls a tempestuous relationship with Blair from \"Zero.\" \"Imperial Bedrooms\" (2010) establishes the conceit that the Clay depicted in \"Zero\" is not the same Clay who narrates \"Bedrooms.\" In the world of \"Imperial Bedrooms,\" \"Zero\" was the close-to-non-fiction work of an author friend of Clay's, and its film adaptation (featuring actors Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz and Robert Downey, Jr.) exists within the world of the novel, too.\n\n\nUpcoming Novels:\n\nOn his podcast, Ellis stated that he is always working on a new novel, but does not know which ones will ever end up getting published.\n\nNon-Fiction:\n\n\"White\" (2019) published by Penguin Random House\n\nFeature Films:\n\n\nShort Films:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2014, Bravo announced that it had teamed up with \"The Rules of Attraction\" feature film adaptation writer/director Roger Avary and producer Greg Shapiro to develop a limited-run series based on Ellis' novel. The plot of the show will stray from the source material and is described as follows: \"Inspired by the book and film of the same name, the high concept series takes the students and faculty at the fictional Camden College and unravels a murder mystery by telling the same story through 12 different points of view. Children of the 1%-ers live as unhinged and wild adults in a Bret Easton Ellis world with seemingly no rules to hold these privileged few down.\" Titled \"Rules of Attraction\" the series will be written by Roger Avary (\"The Rules of Attraction\", \"Beowulf\") for Lionsgate TV with Greg Shapiro (\"Zero Dark Thirty\") serving as an Executive Producer.\n\nA remake of \"American Psycho\" is in the works, without Ellis' involvement, Ellis confirmed this on his Twitter page in early 2014. Ellis stated in a 2013 interview with Film School Rejects that the original \"American Psycho\" doesn't really work as a movie.\n\n\nAs of the spring of 2014, Ellis has been filming in and around Los Angeles. On his Podcast he had stated that he writes scenes and then when certain locations, equipment and his actors are available, they will spontaneously shoot the material, with Ellis directing. He has also stated via his Podcast, his Twitter, his Instagram and his Facebook that he does not know what form this project will take when they complete it. It could be a feature film or a web-series. The project's producer, and Ellis' producing partner, Braxton Pope, has been regularly posting updates and pictures from the production on his Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nOn November 18, 2013, Ellis launched a podcast with PodcastOne Studios. The aim for the show, which delivers 1 hour segments, is to have Ellis engage in open and honest conversation with his guests about their work, inspirations, life experiences as well as music and movies. Ellis, who has always been averse to publicity, has been using the platform to engage in intellectual conversation and debate about his own theoretical observations on the media, the film industry, the music scene and the analog vs. digital age in a generational context. Notable guests have included Kanye West, Marilyn Manson, Judd Apatow, Chuck Klosterman, Kevin Smith, Michael Ian Black, Matt Berninger, Brandon Boyd, BJ Novak, Gus Van Sant, Joe Swanberg, Ezra Koenig, Stephen Malkmus, John Densmore, Fred Armisen & Carrie Brownstein, Ivan Reitman, and Adam Carolla.\nIn April 2018, The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast began a Patreon in order to get instant access to new episodes. $1.00+ is charged per episode. It is unclear whether episodes will be released to non-patrons.\n\nThe Official Synopsis for the \"Bret Easton Ellis Podcast\":\n\n\"Controversial best-selling author and screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis delivers a weekly glimpse into one of popular culture's most fascinating minds. The entertainment industry's top writers, directors, actors and musicians will join Bret to discuss the issues and complexities that keep the creative world turning as we experience this intriguing period in our planet's history. The same sensibilities that have formed Bret's impressive catalog in literature and film will be on display with each and every new episode of The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast.\"\n\n\n"}

She lost the general election to Republican incumbent John Kline.\n\nRowley grew up in New Hampton, Iowa and graduated valedictorian of her high school class in 1973. Her father was a letter carrier for 31 years. She received her B.A. degree in French and with honors from Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa in 1977. In 1980, she received her J.D. degree from the University of Iowa College of Law and passed the Iowa Bar Exam that summer.\n\nIn January 1981, Rowley became a Special Agent with the FBI and was assigned to the Omaha, Nebraska and Jackson, Mississippi divisions. Beginning in 1984, she spent six years working in the New York City field office on investigations involving Italian organized crime and Sicilian heroin. During this time she served three temporary assignments in the U.S. embassy in Paris and the consulate in Montreal. In 1990, she was transferred to the FBI's Minneapolis field office, where she became Chief Division Counsel. There she taught constitutional law to FBI agents and police officers, and oversaw the Freedom of Information, Asset Forfeiture Program, Victim-Witness and community outreach programs.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Rowley wrote a paper for FBI Director Robert Mueller documenting how FBI HQ personnel in Washington, D.C., had mishandled and failed to take action on information provided by the Minneapolis, Minnesota Field Office regarding its investigation of suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui. Moussaoui had been suspected of being involved in preparations for a suicide-hijacking similar to the December 1994 \"Eiffel Tower\" hijacking of Air France 8969. Failures identified by Rowley may have left the U.S. vulnerable to the September 11, 2001, attacks. Rowley was one of many agents frustrated by the events that led up to the attacks, writing:During the early aftermath of September 11th, when I happened to be recounting the pre–September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to other FBI personnel in other divisions or in FBIHQ, almost everyone's first question was \"Why?—Why would an FBI agent(s) deliberately sabotage a case? (I know I shouldn't be flippant about this, but jokes were actually made that the key FBI HQ personnel had to be spies or moles like Robert Hanssen who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis's effort.)\nIn May 2002 Rowley testified to the Senate and the 9/11 Commission about the FBI's pre-9/11 lapses due to its internal organization and mishandling of information related to the attacks. Mueller and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) pushed for and achieved a major reorganization, focused on creation of the new Office of Intelligence at the FBI. This reorganization was supported with a significant expansion of FBI personnel with counterterrorism and language skills.\n\nIn February 2003, Rowley wrote a second open letter to Mueller, in which she warned her superiors that the bureau would not \"be able to stem the flood of terrorism that will likely head our way in the wake of an attack on Iraq\". In April 2003, Rowley stepped down from her legal position to return to being a FBI Special Agent. At the end of 2004 she retired from the FBI after serving for 24 years.\n\nRowley jointly held the \"TIME\" \"Person of the Year\" award in 2002 with two other women credited as whistleblowers: Sherron Watkins from Enron and Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom.\nShe also received the 2002 Sam Adams Award.\n\nIn May 2005, Rowley announced that she was considering running against incumbent Representative John Kline for Minnesota's 2nd District seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2006. At the time of her announcement, she had been living in Apple Valley, Minnesota for 15 years. Rowley had formerly voted and identified as a Republican, but on June 27, 2005, she announced that she was entering the race as a DFLer, and on July 6 officially kicked off her campaign at her home.\n\nOn August 18, 2005, Rowley attended a vigil in Crawford, Texas, outside President George W. Bush's ranch requesting that the president meet with Cindy Sheehan to answer Sheehan's questions about the War in Iraq and the death of Sheehan's son, Casey.\n\nOn January 3, 2006, an unauthorized professionally retouched image appeared on Rowley's campaign website. This image depicted Kline, a retired Marine Corps colonel, as Colonel Klink from \"Hogan's Heroes\". Kline objected to the photo, and the Rowley campaign removed the image the same day and initiated an investigation. Rowley apologized quickly.\n\nRepresentative John Murtha (D-PA) endorsed Rowley. He visited the district during the campaign and held a rally for Rowley at the local VFW in Rosemount, while veterans protested outside. The Rowley campaign subsequently focused efforts on veterans' groups and others with direct experience of the war in Iraq. Financing her campaign proved difficult. Opposing an incumbent conservative such as Kline in a conservative district did not attract money from the most robust Democratic resources, such as the DNC.\n\nKline's campaign achieved a 2–1 advantage in raising funds, and he easily retained his seat.\n\nSince 2003 Rowley has spoken publicly on ethics and ethical decision-making to various groups. She is a writer and blogger. She joined other whistleblowers on the June 2015 speaking tour \"Stand Up for Truth\" which went through London, Oslo, Stockholm and Berlin. She returned to lecture at her alma mater three times, in 2003, 2004 and 2015.\n\nRowley is married and has four children. During her time in the FBI she was \"the sole breadwinner of a family of six\".\n\nRowley authored a chapter in \"Patriotism, Democracy, and Common Sense: Restoring America's Promise at Home and Abroad\". edited by Alan Cutis and Kevin Phillip (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2005, 496 pages, ).\n\nShe has been a regular contributor at the \"Huffington Post\" since January 2006 and written for \"The Guardian\".\n\n\n"}

He was then captured and served with the Allied forces in Italy, in an anti-tank unit of the II Corps of the Polish armed forces, which was under British command.\n\nAfter moving to England just after the Second World War, Trebus married Jozefa Noga in 1949. He and his wife had five children. After Trebus's wife died, his children seldom visited.\n\nTrebus had been \"a collector\" all his life and he was often seen pushing a hand cart filled with his latest acquisitions, which he would carefully sort into separate piles in his garden and home. One of Trebus's major loves was Elvis Presley, and he managed to collect and store away a copy of almost every single record recorded by the artist.\n\nIn his eighties, living alone in a run-down house in Crouch End in north London, he was constantly in trouble with the environmental health department of the London Borough of Haringey, because of complaints about the rubbish surrounding his home. He lived in a tiny area on the ground floor in his house, surrounded by piles of rubbish, because he never threw anything away. In the BBC documentary series \"A Life of Grime\", Trebus was repeatedly shown arguing with council workers who had been instructed to clear his house of the of rubbish it contained. He was eventually re-housed at the Trentfield Nursing Home in Southgate, where he died at the age of 83. Following his death, the BBC broadcast an hour-long tribute, \"Mr Trebus: A Life of Grime\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3415151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3415151", "title": "Elmo Patrick Sonnier", "text": "Elmo Patrick Sonnier\n\nElmo Patrick \"Pat\" Sonnier (February 21, 1950 – April 5, 1984) was a convicted American murderer and rapist in Louisiana who was executed by electrocution at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Louisiana on April 5, 1984. Sonnier was sentenced to death and his younger brother, Eddie, to life on April 25, 1978, for the November 5, 1977, rape and murder of Loretta Ann Bourque, 18, and the murder of David LeBlanc, 17. \n\nSister Helen Prejean was asked to write to death row inmates as part of her Order's community outreach program and happened to write to Sonnier. She became his spiritual adviser and eventually wrote \"Dead Man Walking\" (1993) about her experience and her belief that the death penalty was morally wrong. \n\nOn November 4, 1977, 17-year-old David LeBlanc and his girlfriend 18-year-old Loretta Ann Bourque attended the Homecoming football game at Catholic High School in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. After the game, the couple drove to an isolated area in St. Martin Parish, a type of lovers' lane. At around 1 a.m., the couple were approached by two men, 27-year-old Elmo Patrick \"Pat\" Sonnier and his younger brother, 20-year-old Eddie James Sonnier. The brothers had been in the area hunting rabbits and were armed with 22-caliber rifles.\n\nThe Sonniers identified themselves as police officers and presented a badge that one of the brothers acquired while working as a security guard. The brothers entered LeBlanc's car. They told the couple that they were trespassing on private property and were under arrest. The brothers took LeBlanc's and Bourque's driver's licenses, handcuffed the couple, and moved them to the back seat. They then told the couple that they were going to drive them to the home of land's owner to see if the owner wished to press trespassing charges. \n\nThe Sonniers drove the couple to an oilfield in Iberia Parish and parked by the road. They handcuffed LeBlanc to a tree in a nearby wooded area. They took Bourque from the car and Elmo raped her. The brothers told her they would release both her and LeBlanc unharmed if she had sex with Eddie James Sonnier. Bourque agreed. Afterward, the brothers took the couple back to the car and removed their handcuffs. Elmo Sonnier decided against releasing them, as he feared the couple would report the incident and he would be reincarcerated at Angola. The brothers forced the couple to lie face down in a ditch and fatally shot them several times. \n\nThe brothers returned LeBlanc's car to St. Martin Parish. When they reached Elmo's 1961 Dodge Dart, they discovered they had a flat tire. They used a jack from LeBlanc's car to change their tire. The jack was later found in Elmo Sonnier's car. The following day, the brothers disposed of LeBlanc's and Bourque's driver's licenses and buried the weapons they used in the killings.\n\nThe Sonnier brothers were arrested on December 5, 1977. Elmo voluntarily confessed to police that he abducted LeBlanc and Bourque, raped Bourque, and killed both. He made a second statement admitting his guilt while being transported to jail, and a third confession the following day. Police searched his home, where they found handcuffs in his bedroom that had been used to restrain LeBlanc and Bourque. They also found LeBlanc's car jack in Elmo's car. Later they discovered the buried guns that had been used in the murders. A bullet from one of the victims matched the guns, which belonged to the Sonnier brothers; another match was made from casings found at the crime scene. Police located a witness who saw Elmo Sonnier's car in St. Martin Parish.\n\nBoth brothers were indicted on two counts of first degree murder. Elmo Sonnier entered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nDuring the trial, the brothers traded accusations as to who did the killings (under Louisiana law, any person who participates in the killing of another human being may be subject to the death penalty, but the extent of participation may be considered when imposing penalty). They were said to have been under the influence of drugs when they committed the crimes. \n\nIn April 1978, Elmo was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Eddie Sonnier was also found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After their first appeal, the court reversed their death sentences due to procedural errors. New sentencing hearings were scheduled. During his brother's second penalty hearing, Eddie James Sonnier recanted his previous testimony, claiming that he was responsible for the killings, not his brother. He also sent a letter to Governor Edwin W. Edwards asserting the same position. \n\nThe prosecution attacked the younger brother's credibility, establishing Elmo Sonnier's lead in the crimes and responsibility for the murders. The state of Louisiana again sentenced Elmo to death. Eddie Sonnier was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole because he was a minor at the time of the crime.\n\nWhile on death row at Louisiana State Prison, Elmo Sonnier was contacted by an outreach effort setting up communication with inmates on Death Row. Sister Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun, was assigned to him. After they started a correspondence, she began to visit him and became his spiritual adviser. He was the first of many death row inmates whom she counseled. Sr. Prejean subsequently became a nationally prominent anti-death penalty activist. \n\nSister Helen Prejean later said that the younger brother, Eddie Sonnier, was guilty of killing LeBlanc and Bourque. She claimed that Elmo was innocent but he felt guilt over his criminal past and for participating in the rape of not only Bourque, but other teenage girls at \"lover's lane\", who had come with their boyfriends. The two brothers had frequently posed as police officers and accosted such couples. They offered to let them go if the girl had sex with both brothers. Elmo told Prejean that he and his brother had pulled the same ruse the night they encountered LeBlanc and Bourque, but his brother lost control and killed the teens.\n\nSonnier's execution date was set for April 5, 1984. On April 4, Sonnier's lawyer attempted to get a stay of execution from the United States Supreme Court, claiming that a former cellmate of Eddie Sonnier's had overheard him confess to the murders. The Supreme Court rejected the request despite information that suggested the wrong person was being executed.\n\nSister Helen Prejean, Elmo Sonnier's spiritual adviser, was permitted to visit with Sonnier during his final hours and to witness his execution. Godfrey Bourque and Lloyd LeBlanc, the fathers of Loretta Bourque and David LeBlanc, respectively, were also granted permission to witness the execution. \n\nIn the execution chamber, Sonnier directed his last statement to Lloyd LeBlanc, saying \"I can understand the way you feel. I have no hatred in my heart. As I leave this world, I ask God to forgive...me for what I did. I also ask your forgiveness for what I did.\" LeBlanc nodded, and then Bourque remarked quietly \"He didn't ask me.\" Sonnier was strapped in what was known as \"Gruesome Gertie\", the state's oak electric chair. After electrical currents were administered, Elmo Patrick Sonnier was pronounced dead at 12:15 a.m. Six hours later, convicted child murderer, Arthur Frederick Goode III, was executed in Florida. It was the first time since 1976 that two convicts were executed on the same day in the United States.\n\nSr. Prejean and other Catholic nuns took responsibility to ensure a proper Catholic burial for Elmo Sonnier. The service, presided over by the bishop of Baton Rouge, Stanley Joseph Ott, was held at a Baton Rouge-area funeral home. Sonnier was buried in Roselawn Memorial Park, in a burial plot normally reserved for nuns. Eddie James Sonnier died in December 2013 at the age of 57, after a short illness, at Louisiana State Prison . He is buried in the prison cemetery.\n\nSister Helen Prejean published a book, \"Dead Man Walking\" (1993), about her relationship with Elmo Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie, another inmate on Death Row whom she counseled. The book was adapted as a 1995 film of the same name directed by Tim Robbins and starring Susan Sarandon as Sister Prejean and Sean Penn as Matthew Poncelett, an amalgam of Sonnier and Willie. Her book was also adapted as an opera of the same name, first produced in 2000 by the San Francisco Opera.\n\n"}
{"id": "2621420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2621420", "title": "Frederic Clay", "text": "Frederic Clay\n\nFrederic Emes Clay (3 August 1838 – 24 November 1889) was an English composer known principally for his music written for the stage. Clay, a great friend of Arthur Sullivan's, wrote four comic operas with W. S. Gilbert and introduced the two men.\n\nWhile working as a civil servant in the Treasury department, Clay began composing seriously in the early 1860s. His first big success was \"Ages Ago\" (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert, for the small Gallery of Illustration. Other pieces with Gilbert and others followed, and Clay turned to composing full-time after his father died in 1873. That year, he composed a successful opera-bouffe version of \"The Black Crook\" for the Alhambra Theatre. Clay's last piece with Gilbert was \"Princess Toto\" (1875). He also composed two cantatas. His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, \"The Merry Duchess\" and \"The Golden Ring\". He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at age 44.\n\nClay was born in Paris to English parents, James Clay (1804–1873), a member of parliament, and his wife, Eliza Camilla Woolrych. Clay was the fourth of six brothers and sisters. His father was celebrated as a player of whist and the author of a treatise on that subject, as well as an amateur composer. His mother also had a musical background, as her mother had been an opera singer. Clay was educated at home by private tutors in London, studying piano and violin, and then music composition under Bernhard Molique and, in 1863, with Moritz Hauptmann in Leipzig, Germany. He then worked as a civil servant in the Treasury department while also pursuing composing.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1873, his inheritance enabled him to become a full-time composer. With the exception of some songs, hymns, instrumental pieces and two cantatas, his compositions were nearly all written for the stage. In the mid-1860s, Clay and his friend Arthur Sullivan became frequent guests at the home of John Scott Russell. By about 1865, Clay became engaged to Scott Russell's youngest daughter Alice, and Sullivan wooed the middle daughter Rachel. The Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, but he broke it off.\n\nClay wrote his first short play for the amateur stage in 1859 called \"'The Pirate's Isle\", and completed the short comic play \"Out of Sight\" the following year. His first professionally produced piece was an opera entitled \"Court and Cottage\", with a libretto by Tom Taylor, which was produced at Covent Garden Theatre in 1862. In 1865, for the same theatre, he composed another opera, the unsuccessful \"Constance\" (1865), with a libretto by Thomas William Robertson. With B. C. Stephenson, he wrote three pieces played by amateurs: \"The Pirate's Isle\", \"Out of Sight\" and \"The Bold Recruit\" (1868), and with W. S. Gilbert he wrote \"Ages Ago\" (1869) for Thomas German Reed's Gallery of Illustration. This piece ran for 350 performances and was revived several times. Clay introduced Gilbert to Arthur Sullivan during a rehearsal for \"Ages Ago\". \"The Bold Recruit\" was revived at a benefit by German Reed at the Gallery of Illustration in 1870 as a companion piece to \"Ages Ago\".\n\nThese were followed by \"The Gentleman in Black\" (1870, also with Gilbert), \"In Possession\" (1871, also for German Reed), \"Happy Arcadia\" (1872, with Gilbert), \"Oriana\" (1873, with a libretto by James Albery), \"Green Old Age\" and \"Cattarina\" (both 1874, with libretti by Robert Reece), \"Princess Toto\" (1875, the last collaboration between Clay and Gilbert), and \"Don Quixote\" (1876). \"Ages Ago\" (a one-act piece) and \"Princess Toto\" (a three-act comic opera) are considered to be among Clay's most tuneful and attractive works. \"The Times\" wrote that the music of \"Princess Toto\" \"is probably surpassed by no modern English work of the kind for gaiety and melodious charm.\"\n\nClay also composed part of the score for the spectacle \"Babil and Bijou\" (1872, also for German Reed) and the successful opera-bouffe version of \"The Black Crook\" (1873 based on the same source material as the earlier American musical of the same name and starring Kate Santley), both of which were produced with success at the Alhambra Theatre. He also furnished incidental music for a revival of \"Twelfth Night\".\n\nClay's two cantatas were \"The Knights of the Cross\" (1866) and \"Lalla Rookh\" (containing perhaps Clay's best-known song, \"I'll sing thee songs of Araby\" and also \"Still this golden lull\"), which was produced successfully at the Brighton Festival in 1877. Clay had difficulty finding work in London and moved to America. There he met with only mixed success and returned to England in 1881. His last works were \"The Merry Duchess\" (1883) at the Royalty Theatre, starring Kate Santley and in which Louie Henri also appeared, and \"The Golden Ring\" (starring Marion Hood) (1883), both with words by G. R. Sims. The latter was written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned to the ground the year before. These shows were both successful and showed an artistic advance upon Clay's previous work.\n\nClay's friend, Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote: \"In all his works Clay showed a natural gift of graceful melody and a feeling for rich harmonic colouring. [His songs included] 'She wandered down the mountain side,' 'Long ago' and 'The Sands of Dee'\". Other songs that achieved popularity are \"Gipsy John\" and \"Who Knows\".\n\nAfter conducting the second performance of \"The Golden Ring\" in December 1883, Clay suffered a stroke that paralysed him and cut short his productive life. In 1889 at the age of 51, he was found drowned in his bath at the home of his sisters in Great Marlow, England, presumably a suicide. He was buried in Brompton cemetery.\n\n\n"}

He is the father of Friedrich Oskar Wannieck.\n\nHe was an Armanist and supporter of List's Armanen runes system. He was also an ardent spiritualist and a firm believer in the Theosophical mahatmas, Morya and Koot Hoomi.\n\nWannieck founded Friedrich Wannieck & Co. in 1864. He was also chairman of the Prague Iron Company and the First Brno Engineering Company, both major producers of capital goods in the Habsburg empire. He was also president of the organisation and publishing house Verein \"Deutsches Haus\" (\"German House\" Association) in Brno. This was a nationalist association for German inhabitants of the city, who knew it by the name of \"Brünn\" and felt encircled by the overwhelming Czech population of South Moravia (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 37).\n\nIn 1888 the \"Verein \"Deutsches Haus\"\" published an historical work entitled \"Der altdeutsche Volksstamm der Quaden [The Ancient German Quadi Tribe]\" by Heinrich Kirchmayr. Wannieck was impressed by the parallels between List's clairvoyant account of the Quadi and the academic study of Kirchmayr. Between Wannieck and List there developed a regular correspondence that laid the basis of a lasting friendship. The \"Verein \"Deutsches Haus\"\" later published three of List's works in its own book-series of nationalist studies of history and literature (\"ibid.\").\n\nWannieck's munificence eventually led to the foundation of the \"Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft\" (Guido von List Society) twenty years later. Around 1905, he and his son Friedrich Oskar were among the signatories to the initial announcement endorsing the formation of the Society. This came to fruition with an official founding ceremony in 1908. The Society's assets came mostly from the Wanniecks, who put up more than 3000 crowns at the inauguration (\"ibid.\", 43-44).\n\nFriedrich Oskar Wannieck (died July 6, 1912) was an Austrian/German and the son of Friedrich Wannieck. He, along with his father, were two of the initial signatories creating the Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft in support of their good friend, Guido von List.\n\nHe was an Armanist and supporter of the Armanen runes system.\n\n"}

He was a congressional nominee in 1984 and 1986, and a presidential candidate in 2004, 2012, and 2016. He has published papers on the hydrogen economy, solar power, and photobiology.\n\nBraun was born November 6, 1948 in Compton, California. A graduate of Arizona State University, Braun lived in Arizona for 42 years. He and his wife Dorothy now reside in Canton, Georgia. In 2002, Braun was the principal of Mesa Wind LLC, which developed wind energy (and solar energy) projects.\n\nBraun received a bachelor's degree in history and general science from Arizona State University in 1971. Since then, he has done independent research in the fields of energy technologies and resources, photobiology, molecular biology, and protein evolution. Braun is an Advisory Board Member of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.\n\nBraun is the founder and senior scientist of the Phoenix Project Foundation (PPF), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, which advocates for a hydrogen-based energy economy rather than the current fossil-fuel-based economy. The foundation promotes ideas outlined in Braun's book, \"Phoenix Project\", initially published in 1990 and revised in 2000.\n\nBraun's published papers and books include material on solar power, the hydrogen economy, and photobiology; he has also published several versions of his book about using renewable energy to generate hydrogen, entitled \"The Phoenix Project\".\n\nBraun has not been elected to office, but was the nominee of the Democratic party for two congressional races in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1984, Braun was the Democratic nominee for Congress in the 1st congressional district of Arizona, losing to incumbent Republican congressman John McCain. According to \"The Arizona Republic\", \"A key element of Braun's energy platform is what he calls the 'Phoenix Project,' a plan to mass produce hydrogen with electrolysis by using solar power to produce the electricity.\" Major political problems of the 1980s that the plan could conceivably address included nuclear weapons, pollution, energy scarcity, and deficit spending. Braun received 22% of the vote.\n\nIn 1986, Braun ran again, and was again the Democratic nominee for Arizona's 1st congressional district, losing to Republican nominee Jay Rhodes. Energy policy in general, and solar power plus the hydrogen economy in particular, was again a key platform-plank of Braun's campaign. Braun also campaigned on a broader set of issues during October 1986, including irrigation and water-use policy. Braun improved on his 1984 performance, and received 29% of the vote.\n\nIn 2004, Braun ran an independent campaign for President, with the campaign-slogan of \"Making America Energy Independent & Pollution Free with Windship Hydrogen Production Systems.\" Braun's energy policy was distinct from the hydrogen economy proposed by George W. Bush, in that Braun wanted to generate hydrogen from seawater via electrolysis (using renewable energy), as opposed to generating hydrogen from coal and nuclear power plants. Braun participated in a Presidential Candidates Forum in 2004 in New Hampshire that was covered by C-Span.\n\nBraun did not run in 2008, but did run again in 2012, against incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama. Braun's 2012 campaign included stops in Iowa.\n\nBraun ran for the Democratic nomination again in 2016.\n\nBraun announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination again in 2020.\n\nBraun has proposed an amendment to the United States Constitution which he calls the Democracy Amendment. It reads \"We the People, hereby empower the majority of American citizens to approve all laws, federal legislation, presidential executive orders, and judicial decisions that impact the majority of citizens.\" His plan is for the amendment to be ratified directly by voters through constitutional conventions. He has made this amendment a focus of past presidential campaigns.\n\n"}

{"id": "171625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171625", "title": "James, son of Zebedee", "text": "James, son of Zebedee\n\nJames, son of Zebedee (Hebrew: , \"Yaʿqob\"; Greek: Ἰάκωβος; ; died 44 AD) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, traditionally considered the first apostle to be martyred. Note that the following relationships are approximate. The Hebrew word אח might be translated as \"brother\", but could also mean a \"cousin\", or, a \"fellow\", meaning a beloved friend. (Giving the parents' names was the best way to make a translation into English clear.) \n\nThe James who was a son of Zebedee and Salome, thus a brother of John the Apostle,is also called James the Greater or James the Great. This is to distinguish him from James, son of Alphaeus (James the Less) and James the brother or cousin or fellow of Jesus (James the Just). James the son of Zebedee is the patron saint of Spain. He is the one often identified as Santiago.\n\nThe son of Zebedee and Salome, James is styled \"the Greater\" to distinguish him from the Apostle James \"the Less\". He was the brother of John, the beloved disciple, probably the elder of the two.\n\nHis parents seem to have been people of means. Zebedee, his father, was a fisherman of the Sea of Galilee, who probably lived in or near Bethsaida, in Galilee, Israel, perhaps in [[Capernaum]. He had some boatmen. Salome, his mother, was one of the pious women who afterwards followed Jesus Christ and \"ministered unto him of their substance\". [[John the Apostle|John]] was personally known to the high-priest. He may have had the wherewithal to provide for the Mother of Jesus.\n\nIt is probable that James' brother, John, had not received the technical training of the rabbinical schools. In this sense, they were unlearned, without any official position among the Jews. According to the social rank of their parents, they must have been men of ordinary education, in the common walks of Jewish life. James is described as one of the first disciples to join Jesus. The [[Synoptic Gospels]] state that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to follow him. James was one of only three apostles whom Jesus selected to bear witness to his [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. James and John (or, in another tradition, their mother) asked Jesus to grant them seats on his right and left in his glory. Jesus rebuked them, and the other ten apostles were annoyed with them. James and his brother wanted to call down fire on a [[Samaritan]] town, but were rebuked by Jesus. The [[Acts of the Apostles]] records that \"Herod the king\" (traditionally identified with [[Herod Agrippa]]) had James executed by the sword. He is the only apostle whose martyrdom is recorded in the New Testament. He is, thus, traditionally believed to be the first of the twelve apostles martyred for his faith. Nixon suggests that this may have been caused by James's fiery temper, for which he and his brother earned the nickname \"[[Boanerges]]\" or \"Sons of Thunder\". [[F. F. Bruce]] contrasts this story to that of the [[Liberation of Saint Peter]], and notes that \"James should die while Peter should escape\" is a \"mystery of [[divine providence]]\".\n\nThe English name \"[[James (name)|James]]\" comes from the Italian \"Giacomo\", a variant of \"Giacobo\" derived from \"Iacobus\" ([[Jacob]]) in [[Latin language|Latin]], itself from the Greek \"Ἰάκωβος\" \"Iakōbos\", from Hebrew יַעֲקֹב.\n\n[[File:Rembrandt - Sankt Jakobus der Ältere.jpg|thumbnail|\"Saint James the Elder\" by [[Rembrandt]]He is depicted clothed as a [[pilgrim]]; note the [[Shell of Saint James|scallop]] shell on his shoulder and his staff and [[pilgrim's hat]] beside him.]]\n\nSaint James is the [[patron saint]] of [[Spain]] and, according to legend, his remains are held in [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. (The name \"Santiago\" is the local evolution of Vulgar Latin \"Sanctu Iacobu\", \"Saint James\".) The traditional [[pilgrimage]] to the grave of the saint, known as the \"[[Way of St. James]]\", has been the most popular pilgrimage for Western European Catholics from the [[Early Middle Ages]] onwards, although its modern revival and popularity stems from [[Walter Starkie]]'s 1957 book, \"The Road to Santiago. The Pilgrims of St. James\". Some 237,886 pilgrims registered in 2014 as having completed the final 100 km walk (200 km by bicycle) to Santiago to qualify for a [[Camino de Santiago#Compostela|Compostela]]. When 25 July falls on a Sunday, it is a \"Jubilee\" year (an \"Año Santo Jubilar Compostelano\" or \"Año Santo Jacobeo\") and a special east door is opened for entrance into Santiago Cathedral. Jubilee years fall every 5, 6, and 11 years. In the 2004 Jubilee year, 179,944 pilgrims received a Compostela. In 2010 the number had risen to 275,135.\n\nThe [[feast day]] of St. James is celebrated on 25 July on the [[liturgical calendar]]s of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]] and certain [[Protestant]] churches. He is commemorated on 30 April in the [[Orthodox Christian liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 30 April currently falls on 13 May of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). The \"[[national day]]\" of Galicia is also celebrated on 25 July, being St James its patron saint.\n\nThe site of martyrdom is located within the [[Cathedral of St. James, Jerusalem|Armenian Apostolic Cathedral of St. James]] in the [[Armenian Quarter]] of [[Jerusalem]]. The Chapel of St. James the Great, located to the left of the sanctuary, is the traditional place where he was martyred, when King Agrippas ordered him to be beheaded (Acts 12:1-2). His head is buried under the altar, marked by a piece of red marble and surrounded by six votive lamps.\n\n[[File:Santiago.de.Compostela.Catedral.Noche.jpg|thumb|According to Catholic tradition, Apostle James, son of Zebedee, spread Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula. In the year 44, he was beheaded in Jerusalem and his remains were later transferred to Galicia in a stone boat, to the place where stands [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]].]]\nThe 12th-century \"[[Historia Compostelana]]\" commissioned by [[bishop]] Diego Gelmírez provides a summary of the legend of St. James, as it was believed at Compostela. Two propositions are central to it: first, that St. James preached the gospel in Iberia, as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his [[martyrdom]] at the hands of Herod Agrippa, his disciples carried his body by sea to Iberia, where they landed at [[Padrón]] on the coast of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], then took it inland for burial at [[Santiago de Compostela]].\n\nThe [[translation (relics)|translation]] of his relics from [[Judea]] to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was done, in [[legend]], by a series of [[Miracle|miraculous]] happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to [[Iria Flavia]] in Iberia, where a massive rock closed around his relics, which were later removed to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]].\n\nAccording to ancient local tradition, on 2 January AD 40, the [[Virgin Mary]] appeared to James on the bank of the [[Ebro River]] at [[Caesaraugusta]], while he was preaching the Gospel in [[Iberia]]. She appeared upon a pillar, [[Nuestra Señora del Pilar]], and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]], in [[Zaragoza]], Spain. Following that apparition, St. James returned to Judea, where he was beheaded by King [[Herod Agrippa I]] in the year 44.\n\nThe tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] (791-842) and of bishop Theodemir of [[Iria Flavia|Iria]]. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the [[shrine]] dedicated to James at [[Santiago de Compostela]], in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in Spain, became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world. The [[Way of St. James]] is a trio of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain. Eventually James became the [[patron saint]] of Spain.\n\nJames suffered martyrdom in AD 44. According to the tradition of the early Church, he had not yet left Jerusalem at this time. An argument supporting this assertion is based on St Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]], written after AD 44, in which he expressed his intention to avoid \"building on someone else's foundation\" by visiting Spain, suggesting that he knew of no previous evangelisation in Hispania.\n\nThe suggestion began to be made from the 9th century that, as well as evangelizing in Iberia, James' body was brought to and is buried in [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]]. No earlier tradition places the burial of St. James in Spain. A rival tradition places the relics of the apostle in the church of [[Saturnin|St. Saturnin]] at [[Toulouse]]; if any physical relics were ever involved, they might plausibly have been divided between the two.\n\nThe tradition of Saint James' burial in Compostela was not unanimously accepted, and numerous modern scholars, following [[Louis Duchesne]] and T. E. Kendrick, reject it. (According to Kendrick, even if one admits the existence of miracles, James' presence in Spain is impossible.) The \"[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]\" (1908) registered several \"difficulties\" or bases for doubts of this tradition, beyond the late appearance of the legend:\nThe [[Bollandist]]s, however, defended it. (Their \"[[Acta Sanctorum]]\", July, VI and VII, gives further sources.) A belief in the authenticity of the relics at Compostela was also asserted by [[Pope Leo XIII]], in his 1884 [[Papal bull|bull]] \"[[Omnipotens Deus]]\".\n\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - St Jacobus in Budapest.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint James as the Moor-killer by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] ([[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Budapest]]). His mantle is that of his military order.]]\n\nAn even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the legendary [[battle of Clavijo]], and was henceforth called \"Santiago Matamoros\" (Saint James the [[Moors|Moor]]-slayer). \"[[Santiago y cierra España|¡Santiago, y cierra, España!]]\" (\"St. James and strike for Spain\") was the traditional [[battle cry]] of medieval Spanish (Christian) armies. [[Cervantes]] has [[Don Quixote]] explaining that \"the great knight of the russet cross was given by God to Spain as patron and protector\".\n\nA similar miracle is related about [[Emilian of Cogolla|San Millán]]. The possibility that a cult of James was instituted to supplant the Galician cult of [[Priscillian]] (executed in 385) who was widely venerated across the north of Iberia as a martyr (at the hands of the local bishops, rather than as a heretic) should not be overlooked. This was cautiously raised by Henry Chadwick in his book on Priscillian; it is not the traditional Roman Catholic view. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" of 1908, however, is quite cautious about the origins of the cult (see above at [[#Controversy|\"Controversy\"]]).\n\n[[File:Cross Santiago.svg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Cross of Saint James]], the symbol of the [[Order of Santiago]]; the hilt is surmounted with a scallop.]]\nJames' emblem was the [[Shell of Saint James|scallop]] shell (or \"cockle shell\"), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes. The French used it for a scallop is \"coquille St. Jacques\", which means \"cockle (or mollusk) of St. James\". The German word for a scallop is \"Jakobsmuschel\", which means \"mussel (or clam) of St. James\"; the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word is \"Jacobs schelp\", meaning \"the shell of St. James\".\n\nThe military [[Order of Santiago]], named after James, was founded in Spain in the 12th century to fight the [[Moors]]. Later, as in other [[orders of chivalry]], the membership became a mark of honor.\n\nJames had a special place in the [[Central Africa]]n [[Kingdom of Kongo]], because of his association with the founding of Christianity in the country in the late 15th century. Portuguese sailors and diplomats brought an appreciation of the saint to Kongo when they first reached the country in 1483. When King [[Afonso I of Kongo]], whose Kongo name was Mvemba a Nzinga, the second Christian king, was facing a rival, his brother Mpanzu a Kitima, in battle, he reported that a vision of Saint James and the Heavenly Host appeared in the sky, frightened Mpanzu a Kitima's soldiers, and gave Afonso the victory. As a result, he declared that Saint James' feast day (25 July) be celebrated as a national holiday.\n\nOver the years, Saint James day became the central holiday of Kongo. Taxes were collected on that day, and men eligible for military duty were required to appear armed. There were usually regional celebrations, as well as one at the capital. In some cases, Kongolese slaves carried the celebration to the New World. There are still celebrations of Saint James Day in Haiti and Puerto Rico.\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that James has been resurrected and that in 1829 he—along with the resurrected [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and the [[Translation (Mormonism)|translated]] [[John the Apostle|John]]—visited [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] and restored the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority with [[apostolic succession]] to earth.\n\n\n\n[[Category:1st-century Christian martyrs]]\n[[Category:44 deaths]]\n[[Category:Angelic visionaries]]\n[[Category:Christian martyrs executed by decapitation]]\n[[Category:Christian saints from the New Testament]]\n[[Category:Fishers]]\n[[Category:Marian visionaries]]\n[[Category:Roman-era Jews]]\n[[Category:Saints from the Holy Land]]\n[[Category:Twelve Apostles]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]"}
{"id": "198753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198753", "title": "Jannes and Jambres", "text": "Jannes and Jambres\n\nIn Jewish and Christian traditions, Jannes and Jambres (Hebrew: יניס Yoḥanai, ימבריס \"Yambres\") are the names given to magicians mentioned in the Book of Exodus. This naming tradition is well-attested in ancient and medieval literature. In Latin manuscripts of the New Testament, and in Latin writing traditions, their names are known as Jamnes and Mambres.\n\nJannes and Jambres are not specifically mentioned in the Tanakh (\"Hebrew Bible\"), but the Egyptian \"wise men and sorcerers\" (two of whom were identified with Jannes and Jambres in Jewish and Christian traditions) are mentioned in Exodus 7:10-12 (KJV)\n\nAnd Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.\nThe names Jannes and Jambres (Greek: Ἰάννης, Ἰαμβρῆς; \"Iannēs, Iambrēs\") appear in 2 Timothy in the New Testament. Origen says that there was an apocryphal book called \"The Book of Jannes and Jambres\", containing details of their exploits, and that Paul the Apostle was quoting from it. This book, known as \"The Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres the magicians\", exists in some Greek fragments present in the Chester Beatty Papyri No XVI (which has been edited and translated by Albert Pietersma ), and in an extensive Ethiopic fragment which was discovered in 2014. It was also probably known to the Qumran community, since the Qumran community refers to one of the magicians by the name of Jannes. The Testament of Solomon also refers to the magicians by the name of Jannes and Jambres.\n\nThe name of Jannes as one of the magicians against Moses occurs in Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\"; Pliny refers to Moses and Jannes as famous magicians of antiquity; Pliny's citation is also referred to in Apuleius. Numenius of Apamea, a Neopythagorean philosopher, called them sacred Egyptian scribes. The Gospel of Nicodemus also refers to the magicians by the name of Jannes and Jambres.\n\nTwo \"wise men\" are referred to by the names \"Johana and Mamre\" in the Babylonian Talmud in Menachoth 85a. \"Jannis and Jambres\" are mentioned by name in the Targum of Pseudo-Jonathan in sections Exodus 1:15, Exodus 7:10-12, and Numbers 22:2. Jewish traditions in the Targums preserve other legendary lore about the pair. They are called the sons of Balaam, the unwitting non-Jewish prophet of Peor. It was also claimed that they converted to Judaism, and that they left Egypt at the Exodus to accompany Moses and the Israelites; however, they perished on the way, either at the Red Sea, or the destruction of the Golden Calf, or at the slaughter of Korah and his followers.\n\nApart from their opposition to Moses there are other aggadic lore and legends about Egyptian sorcerers; it was said that during the end of their days they had necessary occult knowledge to embark on a journey to the Jewish world to come. They were not welcomed and the angels of the first few heavens fought them vigorously but they could not evict them due to the potent talismans that were worn by the wizards. As they entered the fourth heaven they were met by Michael and Gabriel; legends say that the battle was very evenly balanced, but in the end it was the angels who had to fall back. Upon entering the fifth heaven they were met by none other than Metatron, who did not come at them with defiance or anger, but appeared accommodating, considering the circumstances; after conversing for a short time the angel was successful in convincing Jannes and Jambres to remove their talismans, leaving them thus vulnerable. Metatron was quick to act and threw them out of heaven with a wave of his hand.

He is the Chief Rabbi of the Czech Republic, and former Chief Rabbi of the city of Prague.\n\nBorn in Prague during the war, Karol Sidon is a distant relative of rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld. His Jewish father Alexander Sidon came from Trnava, where his great-uncle Shimon Sidon was the first rabbi after a long expulsion of Jews from the city. Alexander was arrested in 1944 and imprisoned by the Gestapo in Pankrác and in Terezin, where he was tortured to death in the same year. Karol was then hidden away in the country until the end of the occupation. Mother raised him alone until 1948 when she remarried a Jew. His stepfather repeatedly escaped from the Terezin ghetto, Kladno mines, from Warsaw, Treblinka and the last of the Soviet gulag.\n\nHe began studying at the \"Academy of Musical Art\" in Prague in 1960 where he began writing film scripts, and radio plays for Czech public radio - Český rozhlas. Until 1968 he worked as a producer for Czech puppeteer Jiří Trnka. In the same year, Sidon's first book, which became a cult book \"Sen o mém otci\" (\"Dream about my father\") was published, in which the author deals with his being brought up without his Jewish father Alexander Sidon, who perished in the Terezín ghetto (his wife was a Christian). In 1977 he was a signatory to Charter 77. He received the Jiří Kolář prize in 1978. He was married to Marcela Třebická, he is the father of the actors Daniel Sidon and Magdalena Sidonová.\n\nIn 1983 he emigrated to West Germany and he studied Jewish studies at the Heidelberg university. He became ordained as a Rabbi after studying for a time in Israel. He returned to the Czech Republic in 1992, where he became chief rabbi of Prague.\n\nRabbi Sidon restored the Jewish Orthodox community. To help get invited many young rabbinical families from Israel. He founded the Lauder School (elementary school named Gur Aryeh and a grammar school named Or Chadash), the construction of a mikveh, the establishment of a midrash Tiferet Uzi (named after his teacher Uzi Kalchheim), Beit Din or kosher shop and Certificates.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Sidon and his supporters had a conflict with city of Prague's Jewish Community Council. This led to Sidon's brief ouster as Chief Rabbi of the city and of his position as rabbi of the city's landmark \"Altneuschul\". It did not affect his status as Rabbi of the Czech Republic, as he retained support of the Federation of Jewish Communities.\n\nIn April, 2004, a coalition headed by Tomáš Jelínek succeeded in installing new leadership of the Prague community. Their goal was to change the way the community worked, being more open to less traditional Jews. In June, in a controversial move, they ousted Sidon from his position as head of the community and its main synagogue, the Altneuschul. Jelinek explained that Sidon failed to fulfill his duties properly, but Sidon and the Roth group countered that the move was politically motivated, and an attempt to change the Orthodox nature of the community's practices.\n\nThe council appointed the local Chabad rabbi, an American named Manis Barash, to lead the synagogue, with other communal rabbinic duties split between Barash and two other local rabbis. Sidon took Jelinek to an Israeli rabbinical court. It ruled that Barash should continue to head the synagogue, but Sidon claimed that Jelinek gave false testimony, negating the ruling. Others in the community ran a grassroots campaign called \"Community for All,\" to remove the new leadership, over several dismissals and violation of privacy. A general assembly vote succeeded in November, replacing Jelinek and his group with another group, led by Jakub Roth. Jelinek refused to leave the office; he and others barricaded themselves in the offices, with hired bodyguards. The ouster was confirmed by another vote on December 20. The second vote's validity was contested by Jelinek's group, but the national Federation of Jewish Communities recognized and accepted it in January 2005.\n\nBarash continued to lead the synagogue. Deputy chairman of the community Jakub Roth told the press: \"this is part of the local Chabad's striving to take over the community's religious life. We have seen an ugly foray of Chabad in their attempt to take over the Old-New synagogue.\" On April 15, 2005 the two factions brawled, when Sidon was offered an honor at the synagogue's Sabbath services, by the \"gabbai\" Jacob Svab. The synagogue in the ancient Jewish Quarter became the scene of an emotional dispute between members of the Chabad movement and followers of Sidon, who had moved his services to the High Synagogue. Tensions were finally resolved toward the end of the year, with all sides agreeing to new elections. The Community for All platform won three-quarters of the vote on December 8, while Jelinek's Coalition for a Democratic Community secured three seats on the board. The last three seats went to community members who did not join either group Sidon was promptly restored to his position the next day.\n\n\n\n\nHis doctrinal works can be found in the magazine Rosh Chodesh and the Jewish Yearbook. From this perspective, it is unquestionably the most important Czech translation of the Five Books of Moses, which was published Sefer. Important is also further translation activity. Translated New Prague Passover Haggadah, sidur (yet unpublished translation of the prayer book) or Machzor on high holidays.\n\nPseudonym Chaim Cigan is the name of one of his ancestors. \n\"Altschulova Metoda,\" Atschul's Method is the first of four books (Piano live, Puzzle, Outsider) in a science fiction series \"mixing politics, prison cells and the secret police with the Middle Ages, Moses and Jewish history – a science fiction thriller told across continents and epochs,\"\n\n\n\n"}

She was one of those that helped organize the great fair in 1863, at Chicago, when nearly US$100,000 was raised, and for which she obtained the original draft of the Emancipation Proclamation from President Lincoln, which was sold for $3,000.\n\nWhen the war was over she instituted a paper called the \"Agitator\", which was afterwards merged in the \"Woman's Journal\". Of this, she was editor for two years and a frequent contributor thereafter. On the lecture platform, she had a remarkable career, speaking mostly in behalf of women's suffrage and the temperance movements. Many years, she traveled annually, speaking five nights each week for five months of the year.\n\nHer printed volumes included: \"Thirty Years Too Late,\" first published in 1847 as a prize temperance tale, and republished in 1878 ; \"Pen Pictures; or, Sketches from Domestic Life\", \"What Shall We Do with Our Daughters? Superfluous Women, and Other Lectures\", \"My Story of the War. A Woman's Narrative of Four Years' Personal Experience as Nurse in the Union Army, and in Relief Work at Home, in Hospitals, Camps and at the Front during the War of the Rebellion\". For \"Women of the Day\", she wrote the sketch of the sculptress, Miss Anne Whitney; and for the \"Centennial Celebration of the First Settlement of the Northwestern States, at Marietta, Ohio, July 15, 1788\", she delivered the historical address.\n\nMary Ashton Rice was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 19, 1821 to Timothy Rice and Zebiah Vose (Ashton) Rice. She was a direct descendant of Edmund Rice, an early Puritan immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony. Livermore came from a military family: her father fought in the War of 1812 and her mother was a descendant of Captain Nathaniel Ashton of London. Livermore was incredibly intelligent, graduating from Boston public schools at age 14. Because there were no public high school or college options for women of that time, she attended school at an all-female seminary in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and read the entire Bible every year until the age of 23. \n\nAfter graduating from the seminary in 1836, she stayed there as a teacher for two years. In 1839, she started a job as a tutor on a Virginia plantation, and after witnessing the cruel institution of slavery, she became an abolitionist. She also began work with the temperance movement at this time, identified with the Washington Temperance Reform and an editor for a juvenile temperance paper. In 1842, she left the plantation to take charge of a private school in Duxbury, Massachusetts, where she worked for three years. She also taught at Charlestown, Massachusetts.\n\nShe married Daniel P. Livermore, a Universalist minister in May 1845, and in 1857, they moved to Chicago. In that year, her husband established the \"New Covenant\", a Universalist journal of which she became associate editor for twelve years, during which time she frequently contributed to periodicals of her denomination and edited the \"Lily\". \n\nAs a member of the Republican party, Livermore campaigned for Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election. In the Chicago Wigwam in 1860, Livermore was the only woman reporter assigned a location for work amidst over hundreds of male reporters. She published a collection of nineteen essays entitled \"Pen Pictures\" in 1863. \n\nDuring the Civil War, she volunteered as an associate member of the United States Sanitary Commission at 40 years old. As agent of its Chicago branch, later named the Northwestern branch, she attended a council of the National Sanitary Commission at Washington in December 1862, organized many aid societies, visited army posts and hospitals, and in 1863, organized the North-western Sanitary Fair in Chicago which raised $86,000. President Lincoln donated his own copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, which was auctioned off at $10,000. Livermore eventually became the co-director of the Chicago branch with Jane Hoge, another soldier's aid advocate. The two women completed a hospital inspection tour across Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri. With a thorough understanding of the needs of the hospitals, Hoge and Livermore sent $1 million worth of food and supplies to hospitals and battlefields most in need.\n\nLivermore, like many other nurses, came up against the issue of women disguised as male soldiers. On a visit to the camp of the 19th Illinois Infantry, a captain pointed out a soldier to Livermore, asking if she noticed anything odd about them. Livermore confirmed the captain's suspicions that the soldier was indeed a woman. The captain called the soldier for questioning, and though she pleaded to stay in service near her beloved, Livermore escorted her out of camp. The soldier escaped Livermore, however, and fled. \n\nIn addition to her nursing services, Livermore was also a prolific writer. She authored numerous books of poetry, essays, and stories, and was a recognized member of the literary guild. Though Livermore had to sacrifice much of her social justice work for nursing, she still managed to publish some kind of content once a week throughout the entirety of the war.\n\nAfter the war, Livermore devoted herself to the promotion of women's suffrage (along with Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe ) and the temperance movement, founding in Chicago in 1869 \"The Agitator\", which in 1870, after she moved to Boston, was merged into the \"Woman's Journal\", of which she was an associate editor until 1872. Livermore became the first president of the Association for Advancement of Women, as well as president of American Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nLike many Universalists of the time, she was interested in spiritualism, and following her husband's death in 1899, she became convinced that he had communicated with her through a medium. Livermore died in Melrose, Massachusetts on May 23, 1905.\n\nThe Mary A. Livermore School in Melrose, operational from 1891 to 1933, was an elementary school named for Livermore. In 1943, nearly four decades after her death, she became the namesake of a World War II Liberty ship, the SS \"Mary A. Livermore\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "762588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762588", "title": "Matthew Nathan", "text": "Matthew Nathan\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Sir Matthew Nathan, (3 January 1862 – 18 April 1939) was a British soldier and colonial administrator, who variously served as the Governor of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, Hong Kong, Natal and Queensland. He was Under-Secretary for Ireland from 1914 to 1916, and was responsible, with the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell, for the administration of Ireland in the years immediately preceding the Easter Rising.\n\nNathan was born in Paddington, England. He was of Jewish descent and the second son of businessman Jonah Nathan and Miriam Jacob Nathan. His brothers were Colonel Sir Frederick Nathan, an officer of the Royal Artillery and sometime Superintendent of Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, and Sir Nathaniel Nathan, a colonial judge in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nNathan was educated at Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he was the winner of the Pollock Medal (1880) before being gazetted to Royal Engineers in 1880. He continued his training at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham from 1880 to 1884.\n\nNathan was sent to military expeditions to Sudan (1884–1885) and to Lushai, India (1889–1894). He was promoted to the position of captain in 1889 and became the secretary to the Colonial Defence Committee between 1896 and 1898. Nathan was promoted to major in 1898.\n\nNathan was appointed acting governor of Sierra Leone from 1899 to 1900. Late that year, he was appointed as Governor of Gold Coast, a position he occupied until 1903. In 1902, Nathan imported into the Gold Coast a £543 French Gardner-Serpollet, paraffin-fired, steam-driven car for his use on the roads around Accra.\n\nIn 1903, Nathan was appointed as Governor of Hong Kong, a position he would serve until 1907. During his tenure, Nathan was credited with the establishment of a central urban planning and reconstruction policy, which regulated the growth of Hong Kong and built major thoroughfares in the Kowloon Peninsula. The construction of Kowloon-Canton Railway started under this period.\n\nIn 1907, Nathan was made Governor of Natal (until 1909). In that same year, he was raised to a higher rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1909 he returned to England and took up an appointment as secretary to the General Post Office, a position he served until 1911. He was chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue between 1911 and 1914.\n\nNathan was appointed Under-Secretary for Ireland in August 1914, just after the outbreak of World War I and the signing into law of the Home Rule Act 1914. His immediate superior was the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell. At this time the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was largely a ceremonial position, and the Chief Secretary spent much of his time in London where he was a member of the cabinet, so the Under-Secretary was effectively the head of the administration in Ireland. Nathan's job involved liaising with the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) to prepare them for self-government. He was also concerned with recruiting in Ireland, and received regular reports from the police and military about anti-recruiting and pro-independence activity, including the threat of a German invasion or arms landing in support of an Irish rising. Alarmed at the growing numbers of separatists in the Civil Service, Nathan wrote to the authorities to have them transferred to England, and eventually got cabinet approval for a letter warning civil servants that they would be dismissed if they continued as members of the Irish Volunteers. He used the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 to suppress newspapers he considered seditious, against the advice of the IPP In general, however, he avoided any action that might provoke violence.\n\nOn Good Friday, 21 April 1916, Nathan was informed that a German boat had been stopped off the coast of County Kerry carrying arms and ammunition, and that a man had been arrested after coming ashore from another vessel. The man arrested was subsequently identified as Sir Roger Casement A mobilization of the Irish Volunteers fixed for Easter Sunday was cancelled the day before. Nathan, believing that a rising had been averted, discussed with the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Wimborne, the necessity of raiding premises associated with the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army and arresting their leaders. Nathan cabled Birrell, the Chief Secretary, in London to obtain authorisation for these actions. On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, while he was in his office in Dublin Castle awaiting Birrell's response, the Easter Rising broke out and Dublin Castle itself was attacked. The Castle gates were closed and the rebels did not press the attack, but Nathan was a virtual prisoner until troops arrived from the Curragh Camp on Monday evening. Nathan remained in the Castle for the rest of the week (being moved to the stables to accommodate the military) where he kept in contact with London, keeping the government up to date with the situation and helping to answer questions in Parliament. The Rising came to an end on 30 April. The same day Birrell offered his resignation, and on 3 May, at Birrell's request, Nathan also resigned. The Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion (the Hardinge commission) was critical of Birrell and Nathan, in particular their failure to take action against the rebels in the weeks and months before the Rising.\n\nAfter his resignation Nathan was appointed secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, a position he held until 1919. In 1920, he was appointed Governor of Queensland and served in that position until 1925. It was to be his last post in the Colonial Service. During his tenure, Nathan actively promoted British migration to Queensland. In 1922 he founded, along with Henry Caselli Richards, the Great Barrier Reef Committee. He was chancellor of the University of Queensland in 1922-25 and was awarded an honorary LL.D. in 1925. After his appointment as Governor expired, Nathan left Queensland for retirement in Somerset, England. He died in England in 1939.\n\n\nNathan Road, the main commercial artery in the Kowloon Peninsula (otherwise known as the Golden Mile), was named after him. In Australia, Nathan and Nathan Heights in Brisbane (the capital city of Queensland) and Nathan Street in the Canberra suburb of Deakin were named after him. Nathan House, a boarding house for Form 2 learners at Maritzburg College in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa is named in his honour. Scottburgh, South Africa also have a street named after Sir Matthew Nathan.\n\n\n"}

He was Vice-Chancellor of Thames Valley University in the 1990s.\n\nFitzgerald grew up on Merseyside.He attended Catholic grammar school in Crosby, Merseyside and gained entry to the University of Cambridge to read Social Sciences, graduating in the early 1970s. In 1977 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Leicester for \"Prisoners in Revolt\" a study which looked at the attempt by the organisation Preservation of the Rights of Prisoners to organise prisoners into a union.\n\nHe was married as a student, later divorced, and has two children. He currently resides in Amsterdam.\n\nFitzgerald began an academic career in the 1970s at Leicester University sociology department as a tutorial assistant for two years. In 1975, he went to the Open University, as a lecturer in Social Policy. He helped build the social sciences faculty into one of the best in the UK, persuading Stuart Hall and other well known sociologists to take up posts there. He was involved in the OU's innovative teaching modes and joint publications. He was expert in the sociology of prisons and policing in Britain and internationally, publishing several books on these topics\n\nFitzgerald latterly became Dean and Director of Studies in the Faculty of Social Sciences at the Open University, then left in 1987/8 to become Deputy Director for Academic Development at Coventry Polytechnic.\n\nHe was appointed Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of Thames Valley University (TVU) in 1991, at 41 years of age the youngest VC in Britain. TVU had been a college of higher education, then became a polytechnic and quickly applied for and received full university status.\n\nHis personal characteristics came to define the image and policies of the new university. He was known for his flamboyant style, sporting an earring, peroxide hair, Armani suits and drove a car with an M4TVU numberplate. His office had no desk, but a sofa and a jukebox. He was the first person ever to use a swearword on the front page of \"Times Higher Education\" in 1996. He was elected vice chair of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals in 1996. \"At 45 he believes he is the youngest vice chancellor, but after five years at TVU – seeing it through a transformation from institute of higher education to polytechnic to university – he is far from the least experienced. Peer respect for the sharp mind behind a laddish exterior was signalled last week when the CVCP council chose him as vice chair in succession to David Melville of Middlesex University.\" \n\nFitzgerald was a passionate advocate for widening participation in higher education. In the mid-1990s, less than a third of eighteen-year-olds went into UK higher education. Fitzgerald used his experience at the Open University and in the polytechnic sector to create a new learning environment to support and sustain a mass system of higher education. As he had experienced at Cambridge and learnt at the Open University, assessment was a key vehicle for teaching itself, and so he argued for continuous, student-driven learning. He envisaged a \"student driven university\" led by a \"New Learning Environment\", which sought to use new media along with some traditional teaching, and whose learning outcomes were career-driven rather than classically academic and disciplinary in nature. He said: \"Just as you need students to be active learners, so you need teachers to be active tutors. A lecture-driven model renders both teachers and learners passive.\" \"...education is something you do; it's not something that happens to you. It is an active process\". He initiated the Paul Hamlyn Learning Resource Centre at the Slough campus (now sold), and introduced new areas of study including courses in performance rock music, and digital technologies, computer animation and games. Though such courses are now commonplace, at the time they were held up as examples of \"dumbing down\" and lowering of standards.\n\nFitzgerald's changes, while prescient in many ways, were instituted rapidly. They were opposed by the staff union of TVU because they led to negative terms and conditions for employees, and poorer and rapidly changing conditions for academics. There were only two years during his tenure that no industrial action was held. He was frustrated that some academic staff were not on board with his vision of a \"New Learning Environment\".\n\nPoor relations with some of the teaching staff, combined with the very rapid pace of change and reliance on new computer technologies, created the greatest problems for his management. A scandal over low pass marks for resit exam candidates was quickly redressed by Fitzgerald in October 1997. He also called in the Quality Assurance Agency. The industrial disputes with staff clearly had a negative impact on meeting marking deadlines, and thus on student progression. The QAA report gave negative evaluations of TVU's academic standards in many areas – registration, timetabling, validation, student support and assessment systems. The report said \"The University chose to implement this vision of a New Learning Environment at the same time as it completely recast the underpinning academic-related administration. As we believe might have been anticipated, this subjected the institution, its staff and its systems, to stresses which it was not able to bear.\" Despite widespread suspicion that the QAA had sought to exercise its authority by exaggerating what had been an administrative crisis rather than finding any genuine loss of academic credibility, Fitzgerald resigned in 1998 after the QAA report was published and a management team led by first Sir William Taylor then Ken Barker took over, ironically initiating more staff redundancies and closures.\n\nFitzgerald worked as an education consultant, but in 2001 he underwent heart surgery, and has not worked since. He is no longer in the public eye, and the only mention of him in recent years has been as an occasional theatre critic at the Edinburgh Festivals.\n\nFitzgerald was well connected with Britain's 'New' Labour Party led by Tony Blair. Tony Blair and David Blunkett opened the Paul Hamlyn Learning Resource Centre on the Slough campus in 1996 with the rejoinder: 'Why, I wonder, can't every university be like TVU?'.\n\nFitzgerald made frequent appearances on British television. He also published regular columns on education policy.\n\n\"Private Eye\" magazine ran a column about a \"trendy Vice Chancellor\" in the 1990s, based on Fitzgerald.\n"}

He made aliyah to Mandatory Palestine in 1924, and worked in building and road construction. He joined Poale Zion movement, later becoming one of its leading figures. In the same year that he immigrated he became a member of the Tel Aviv-Jaffa workers council that year, serving on it until 1935. In 1926 he was elected onto Tel Aviv's city council.\n\nIn 1935 he was sent to the United States as a Poale Zion emissary, working there for two years. In 1937 he was invited to Spain (during the civil war) by the republican government. He also served on the Zionist Executive Committee and the Histadrut's executive committee, and worked in the Organisation department of the Jewish Agency in the 1940s.\n\nIn the 1949 elections he was voted into the Knesset on the Mapam list. He retained his seat in the 1951 elections, but on 23 August 1954, left the party alongside Israel Bar-Yehuda, Yitzhak Ben-Aharon and Aharon Zisling to re-establish Ahdut HaAvoda - Poale Zion as an independent party. He was re-elected on the new party's list in the 1955 elections, but lost his seat in 1959. He failed to win a seat in the 1961 elections, but entered the Knesset on 4 May 1965 as a replacement for the deceased Bar-Yehuda. He retained his seat in the November 1965 elections, by which time Ahdut HaAvoda had entered an alliance with Mapai, known as the Alignment. Following a formal merger of the two (with the addition of Rafi), in 1968 this became the Labor Party, and, following the addition of Mapam to the alliance, was again renamed the Alignment in 1969. Erem lost his seat in the elections that year. He died in 1978.\n"}
{"id": "13084372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13084372", "title": "Mustapha Harun", "text": "Mustapha Harun\n\nTun Datu Haji Mustapha bin Datu Harun, or Tun Mustapha for short (31 July 1918 – 2 January 1995), was the first governor of the Malaysian state of Sabah. He was also the third chief minister of the state from 1967 to 1975, and was the president for the political party United Sabah National Organisation (USNO). He is considered by some to be one of the founding leaders of Sabah and was an important party in the negotiations leading to the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963.\n\nHe is known to some as the \"father of Sabah's independence\" and also the \"father of Sabah's development\". However, he is also considered by many Sabahan opposition leaders who later formed the new party BERJAYA as a dictator and alleged to misappropriated huge sums of money from the state's coffers (primarily through timber concessions) to support his lavish lifestyle.\n\nMustapha was not born in anywhere in the Sulu Archipelago, but he is a distant relative of the Sultan of Sulu. He was born in Kampung Limau-limauan, Kudat. He is of Suluk-Bajau origin (Bajau Bannaran/Bajau Kudat and not Bajau Ubian).\n\nDuring World War II, he was wanted by the Japanese forces because of the rebellions he led against them, mainly in Kudat during the Japanese occupation. But when they could not find him, they caught his younger brother and eventually killed him because his brother would not reveal where he was hiding. Albert Kwok invited Mustapha to join in the Jesselton Revolt but he advised Kwok to wait and prepare, saying the time wasn't right for insurrection. However, Kwok was forced to launch the revolt ahead of schedule because the Chinese were going to be subjected to conscription by the Japanese. Kwok was joined in the revolt along with Suluks and Bajaus under Panglima Ali. The revolt failed and the Japanese engaged in large scale massacres of indigenous civilians, including women and children especially from the Suluks community.\n\nMustapha founded the party United Sabah National Organisation, better known by the acronym USNO. He, together with Donald Stephens, are often credited as important figures in Sabah in bringing forth Sabah's independence and in the formation of Malaysia in 1963. When Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963, he became the first Yang di-Pertua Negara (governor) of Sabah.\n\nIn the 1967 state election, USNO won, and Mustapha became the third Chief Minister of Sabah.\n\nWhen he was Chief Minister, his relationship with the Malaysian central government was not very good. Although the central government, represented by the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, was a partner of USNO, they were worried about certain stances taken by Mustapha, in particular, his intention or threat to secede Sabah from Malaysia. Mustapha also refused to sign an oil agreement with the federal government which stated that only 5% of Sabah's oil revenue will be given to the state. Mustapha demanded at least 30% for the development of Sabah where it will be drilled.\n\nMustapha also succeeded in converting a significant number of non-Muslim indigenous people in Sabah into Muslim. Aside from his involvement in politics and religion (Islam), he also made contributions in the education of Sabah. He mooted the idea of forming Sabah Foundation (\"Yayasan Sabah\") and was responsible in setting up the first university, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Sabah Campus, and also the setting up of ITM (Institut Teknologi Mara).\n\nHe was also the Deputy Head of PERKIM, when the late Tunku was the President and also the time of Patinggi Taib. He was also the head of United Sabah Islamic Association (USIA) and a member of RISEAP.\n\nIn 1975, USNO secretary-general Harris Salleh left the party to form BERJAYA. This party was backed up by the federal government thru the oil lobby. In the 1976 state election, BERJAYA won and Mustapha was ousted from power.\n\nSince his ouster in 1976, Tun Mustapha had been trying to initiate a merger of his party USNO with peninsular-based United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in a bid to return to the corridors of power in Sabah. However, the UMNO supreme council was hesitant on a merger because their party did not accept non-Malay/non-muslim members. Besides, the UMNO president at that time, Tun Hussein Onn was uneasy with Tun Mustapha's close relationship with UMNO's anti-Hussein faction. Mustapha remained active in politics, leading USNO and contesting in four subsequent state elections (1981, 1985, 1986, and 1990). Although they never won again, they still managed to win several seats in the state assembly. They also remained a partner of BN at the federal government level (as opposed to the state level). After the 1990 state election, he teamed up with Harris Salleh again, after BERJAYA themselves were ousted by Parti Bersatu Sabah. This resulted in a merger of USNO and BERJAYA to create the Sabah chapter of UMNO. Mustapha became its first chief of UMNO Sabah.\n\nMustapha is remembered by the Catholics of Sabah for imposing to the letter the immigration laws by denying foreign priests who have not obtained permanent residency on the extension of their visas. All the priests who object to their expulsion for doing religious works among the Catholics were arrested by using his powers as the Chairman of the State Security Operation Committee and CM of Sabah State Government.\n\nUnder his orders, on 2 December 1972, the police made a raid at the missions at Tambunan, Papar, Bundu Tuhan and Kuala Penyu. The raids at Tambunan and Papar were successful, timed early in the morning with the church bell ropes cut to prevent it from being used to warn the people. The priests were at Kapayan long before the parishioners were aware of it. The raid at Kuala Penyu was initially a fiasco with a reception committee of 600 Catholics. To avoid clashes, by 11 am reinforcements were flown in to arrest one priest. On 15 December more priests were arrested at Keningau, Tenom and Limbahau. The rest of the priests who only had temporary residence permits, on hearing this has no choice but to say goodbye to their parishioners and went home or were given new assignments to nearby countries. As reported in local news such as \"Daily Express\" (p. 2, 11 November 2009), the Malaysian home ministry informed in parliament that a biography of Mustapha's political opponent who died in the Double Six Crash plane crash, Peter Mojuntin, is banned. The reason was that the book \"allegedly\" recorded that Peter exposed Mustapha's attempt to stop Catholism in Sabah by deporting and arresting foreign missionary priests who were serving their local parishes in the state.\n\nPeter's house was also surrounded by the police after all the priests were arrested because only he dared to voice his opposition to the prosecution of the priests. He was not arrested because of his strong political support from the Kadazan people of Penampang.\n\nWhile the 20-point agreement had provided that “there should be no any state religion in North Borneo”, Mustapha party of USNO including himself is very active in propagating Islam and amend a bill to make Islam as the official religion of the state. He actively sponsored the creation of United Sabah Islamic Association (USIA) on 14 August 1969 which modelled from similar agencies that already existing in West Malaysia. He actively campaigned to persuade non-Muslims to convert to Islam due to what he perceive that the unity can only be achieved through a common religion and language, where he also make the Malay language as the official language of Sabah by limiting the importance of English language. By February 1974, around 75,000 non-Muslim Sabahans had been converted to Islam which rapidly increase to 95,000 in 1975.\n\nDuring Mustapha term as a Chief Minister of Sabah, he has a vision to make Islam as the majority religion in the state. Thus to achieve it, he was actively harbouring Muslim refugees from the Philippines more so with his similar ethnic background relations with the Muslim refugees. Mustapha was also believed to have aiding the Moro in their struggle for independence by providing arms and training facilities in Malaysia. His action were tolerated by the Malaysian government because he was consistent in delivering Muslim votes as well for his continuous backing for the Malaysian government which he was later succeeded in making Islam as the main religion of Sabah. However, as Malaysian government wanted to maintain good relations between Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with the Philippine central government, the Malaysian government cannot raise the plight of Muslim minority in the Philippines. Due to this, Mustapha planned to secede the state of Sabah from Malaysia but his intention failed after he was removed from his position in 1975. The Philippine central government then retracted the Sabah claim in 1977 as a reward for Malaysian government action to stop supporting the southern Philippines Muslim rebels.\n\nHe died on 2 January 1995 at Sabah Medical Centre, Teluk Likas, Kota Kinabalu, at the age of 76. He was buried at the Muslim cemetery in Kampung Ulu/Ulu Seberang, Putatan District which was formerly used as a fortress by the late Paduka Mat Salleh and the State Government has named the cemetery \"Taman Memorial Tun Datu Haji Mustapha\". His memorial is not in Tambunan. The Tun Datu Mustapha Memorial in Tambunan is meant for the distant uncle, Paduka Mat Salleh.\n\nDuring the 8th Convocation Ceremony of UMS (Universiti Malaysia Sabah) held on 2–3 September 2006, he was conferred the Honorary Degree-Doctor of Philosophy (Social Development)\n\nThe state government renamed the Sabah Foundation Building to Tun Mustapha Tower, as a token of appreciation for his contributions to the state.\n\nTun Mustapha Marine Park, a marine park in Kudat, Sabah was named after him.\n\n"}

He won a scholarship to the Queen's College, Oxford in 1940.\n\nDuring the Second World War, as an undergraduate, Hilton was obliged to enroll in training with the Royal Artillery, and was scheduled for conscription in summer 1942. Instead, he was interviewed by a team touring universities looking for mathematicians with knowledge of German, and was offered a position in the Foreign Office without being told the nature of the work. The team was, in fact, recruiting on behalf of the Government Code and Cypher School. He accepted, and, aged 18, arrived at wartime codebreaking station Bletchley Park on 12 January 1942.\n\nHe was initially put to work on Naval Enigma in Hut 8. In late 1942, he transferred to work on German teleprinter ciphers. A special section known as the \"Testery\" had been formed in July 1942 to work on one such cipher, codenamed \"Tunny\", and Hilton was one of the early members of the group. His role was to devise ways to deal with changes in Tunny, and to liaise with another section working on Tunny, the \"Newmanry\", which complemented the hand-methods of the Testery with specialised codebreaking machinery. Occasionally the same message was sent repeated, a major security blunder which Bletchley park called a \"depth.\" Hilton derived great satisfaction from being able to look at the encoded texts coming from two separate teleprinter messages, combine them and extract two messages in clear German.\nHilton obtained his DPhil in 1949 from Oxford University under the supervision of John Henry Whitehead. His dissertation was titled, \"Calculation of the Homotopy Groups of \"A\"-polyhedra\".\n\nIn 1958, he became the Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Birmingham. He moved to the United States in 1962 to be Professor of Mathematics at Cornell University, a post he held until 1971. From 1971 to 1973, he held a joint appointment as Fellow of the Battelle Seattle Research Center and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington. 1 September 1972, he was appointed Louis D. Beaumont University Professor at Case Western Reserve University. 1 September 1973, he took up the appointment. In 1982, he was appointed Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Binghamton University, becoming Emeritus in 2003. Latterly he spent each spring semester as Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the University of Central Florida.\n\nHilton constructed the 51-letter palindrome \"Doc note, I dissent.

Holcomb is best known for his groundbreaking work in HIV Prevention when he founded 'Project Weber', a program for male sex-workers in Rhode Island, The program is named after Roy Weber, a 22-year-old male sex worker who was murdered on Christmas Day, 2003. Holcomb has done extensive research on male prostitution in the United States, Canada and Europe, and has been featured in several films on this subject.\nHolcomb is a recovering addict who began his career in HIV prevention in November 2007. The Project Weber outreach team he leads provides condom distribution, needle exchange, substance abuse referrals and HIV testing. He cited the lack of data available on male commercial sex workers in the region as his reason for helping develop a 2010 survey to assess the needs of this population. Project Weber recruited and surveyed 50 male sex workers living on the streets of Providence. Holcomb also cited that the fact that he and members of his team are former sex workers themselves as one of the primary reasons why they were able to gain access to the men in order to conduct this survey.\n\nThe project says they have gleaned valuable data on male sex workers who work and live on the streets of Providence. Holcomb and his team were the first to gather data on this population in Rhode Island history. Prostitution in Rhode Island was legal until 2009. His work has generated interest from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has received national attention.\n\nHolcomb has provided the general public with educational trainings regarding male sex workers in the U.S. and abroad. He presented Project Weber for the first time on a national level at the 2010 HIV Prevention Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C..\n\nOne of his most notable presentations was on January 29, 2011 in Providence, Rhode Island. Holcomb brought experts from different countries together to raise awareness and advocate for services and support. Following the testimonies of the sex workers in recovery, the highlight of the event was a presentation by actor Mirek Caslavka from the Czech Republic. Caslavka introduced the award-winning film he starred in titled Mandragora, a drama about male prostitution in Prague.\n\nHolcomb received a \"hero's recognition\" in the September 2012 issue of POZ magazine and is featured in the documentary film \"Invisible: The Unseen World of Male Prostitution\".\n\nOn October 1, 2013, Holcomb became Project Director of the first peer support drop-in center for male sex workers in the United States.

The members of the cult, dubbed by the media as The Narcosatanists (Spanish: \"Los Narcosatánicos\"), called her The Godmother (\"La Madrina\"), with Constanzo as “The Godfather” (\"El Padrino\"). The cult was involved in multiple ritualistic killings in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, including the murder of Mark Kilroy, an American student killed in Matamoros in 1989.\n\nBorn in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, she attended high school in Brownsville, Texas, United States while still living south of the border, and gained resident alien status so she could attend Texas Southmost College. She was known among her peers as a good student. She is tall and studied physical education, preparing to transfer to a university to earn a teaching certification in physical education.\n\nAdolfo Constanzo, a Cuban American fortune-teller and religious cult leader, introduced her to witchcraft and dark magic. He gave her the nickname \"La Madrina\", Spanish for \"godmother\", and initiated her into his cult, which was a conglomeration of Santería, Aztec warrior ritual, and Palo Mayombe, complete with blood sacrifices. Constanzo sexually assaulted and killed drug dealers and used their body parts for religious sacrifice ceremonies in an old warehouse near Matamoros. Many of his victims' body parts were cooked in a large pot called a \"nganga\". Constanzo made Sara Aldrete second-in-command of his cult, and directed her to supervise his followers while he was shipping marijuana over the border into the U.S.\n\nIn 1989, the killings grew more frequent and gained attention when American tourist Mark J. Kilroy, a University of Texas student on Spring Break, was abducted. Constanzo, Aldrete and the rest of the cult went on the run when detectives discovered their 'shrine'. They found human hair, brains, teeth and skulls at the site of the murders. Eventually, the police found their hideout in Mexico City on May 6, 1989. After a shootout, Constanzo and one of his accomplices were shot and killed by another member of the cult, apparently at Constanzo's behest. Aldrete was convicted of criminal association in 1990 and jailed for six years. In a second trial, she was convicted of several of the killings at the cult's headquarters, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. If Aldrete is ever released from prison, American authorities plan to prosecute her for the murder of Mark Kilroy.\n"}
{"id": "38168864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38168864", "title": "Signare", "text": "Signare\n\nSignare was the name for the Mulatto French-African women of the island of Gorée in French Senegal during the 18th and 19th centuries. These women of color managed to gain some individual assets, status, and power in the hierarchies of the Atlantic Slave Trade.\n\nSignares commonly had power in networks of trade and wealth within the limitations of slavery. The influence held by these women led to changes in gender roles in the family structure archetype. Some owned masses of land as well as slaves. European merchants and traders, especially the French and British, would settle on coastal societies inhabited by signares in order to benefit from the increased proximity to the sources of African commerce. The earliest of these merchants were the Portuguese. These merchants were given the name \"lançados\", because \"they threw themselves\" among Africans, and they would establish relationships with the most influential signares who would accept them in order to obtain commercial privileges. \n\nMany signares were wed under “common local law” that was recognized by priests of the Catholic faith. These marriages were for economic and social reasons. Both signares and their husbands gained from these partnerships. Europeans passed their names down to the offspring and with it their lineage.\nWhen some of the signares became too powerful, leaders like the Portuguese Crown sought ways to remove the women from their wealth. Different crimes that the Portuguese Crown sought to accuse the women of were crimes against the state or crimes against Christianity. An example of this appears with Bibiana Vuz de França. She was a prominent signare who over the years accumulated a lot of wealth and slaves. After realizing how powerful that she was, the Crown wanted to find a way dismantle her influence and power. “Accused of rebellion, trading with foreigners, and tax evasion, she was imprisoned with her younger brother and another co-conspirator and taken to Cape Verde Islands”. \n\nShe was able to receive a royal pardon and free her younger brother after leading a coup against the Crown’s representatives. Due to her power, the Crown sought to criminalize Bibiana Vuz de França. However, once they realized that she was too powerful and too influential, all charges against her were dropped and she was once more considered loyal to the crown. Bibiana Vuz de França’s confrontation with the Portuguese Crown represents the strength that the signares in this time period had, and also the Portuguese growing inability to control the people.\n\nThe social status of signares also allowed for greater social mobility in Gorée than in other parts of Africa. Though there is limited documentation on the origins of most of the signares, it seems likely that at this time the people of Gorée were divided into several social classes: the \"jambor \"or freeborn; the \"jam\" or people of slave descent; the \"tega \"and \"uga \"or blacksmiths and leatherworkers and \"griots \"or storytellers. \n\nMany signares were of the \"jam \"or \"griot\" class, and were often married by European men because they were considered especially beautiful. Once married to European men, women helped them handle many of their trading affairs and transactions, and gained economic and social stature in the community themselves. In this way women of lower social status could gain power in the community and become important traders through their marital status.\n\nMarriages between African women and European men were governed by local law. Given the fact that many European men would not stay in Gorée permanently, marriages were often in a state of flux. If a European man left Gorée and intended to return, the African woman would wait for him. When the man got on the boat to go back to Europe, signares would scoop up the sand where his last footprints were and put it a handkerchief, which she'd hang on her bedpost it until he returned. Signares would often wait years for men to return without remarrying. \n\nIf European men left without planning to return, or if a signare learned that her European husband was not going to return to Gorée, women would remarry. This was not considered shameful in any way, and signares would not lose any of their social status, and would often retain much of the trading power that they gained through their prior marital status. Remarried signares would often raise their children from their European husbands alongside their new African husbands, and these children would receive inheritance from their mothers, not their fathers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24076840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24076840", "title": "Techno Viking", "text": "Techno Viking\n\nTechno Viking is an internet phenomenon or meme based on a video from the 2000 Fuckparade in Berlin, Germany.\nThe 4-minute video shot by experimental video artist Matthias Fritsch at the Fuckparade on 8 July 2000 begins with the title \"Kneecam No. 1\". The camera is on a group of dancing people with a blue-haired woman in front. A man stumbles into the scene grabbing the woman. A bare-chested man (known colloquially as the Techno Viking) wearing a Mjölnir pendant enters the scene while turning to that man. He grabs him by the arms and the camera follows, showing the confrontation. The bare-chested man pushes the guy back in the direction he came. He looks at him sternly and then points his finger at him, ensuring he behaves. Then the camera follows the bare-chested man as the techno parade continues. Another observer comes from the back of the scene offering an inverted bottle of water to him. As the situation calms down, the bare-chested man starts to dance down Rosenthaler Straße () to techno music.\nFritsch uploaded the video to the internet in 2001. Fritsch intended to raise questions of whether the action was real or staged. In 2006 an unknown user re-published it to YouTube, and it went viral in 2007. According to Fritsch, its popularity began on a Central American pornography site. After being posted on Break.com, it peaked on 28 September at more than 1 million views per day and was watched by over 10 million people over 6 months. More than 700 responses and edited versions were posted. It was the #1 clip on \"Rude Tube\"'s series-three episode \"Drink and Drugs\". Mathew Cullen and Weezer wanted to include Techno Viking in their compilation of Internet memes for the \"Pork and Beans\" music video but were unable to. Techno Viking was also rendered in oils as part of a series on internet memes. By mid-2010, the video had generated over 20 million hits on YouTube alone; , the original version had more than 16 million views. Techno Viking has a Know Your Meme page, which documents aspects of the meme including derived images such as Techno Viking with his finger raised and the word \"Obey\", and an Encyclopedia Dramatica page.\n\nFritsch mounted an installation and the online Techno Viking Archive \"to research the strategies of participatory practice in digital social networks\" and presented lectures on the reception of the video. His \"Music from the Masses\" project was suggested by the Techno Viking experience: it explores web collaboration by providing silent films for artists to provide soundtracks. In response to legal action by the man featured in the video, access to the Techno Viking video itself has been restricted and annotations on YouTube blocked since late 2009.\n\nFritsch did not know the man's name at the time of filming. There was speculation about his identity, for example on Encyclopedia Dramatica. A man who appeared in the 2009 \"Bodybuilding\" broadcast of the German television show segment \"Raab in Gefahr\" was taken to be Techno Viking in a YouTube upload. In 2008, fans claimed MMA fighter Keith Jardine was Techno Viking. The lawyer of the Techno Viking asserts that his client had never been a public figure and that he did not want to become one.\n\nThe unnamed man's court case against Fritsch concerning infringement of personality rights opened in Berlin on 17 January 2013. In June, a decision was reached for the plaintiff and Fritsch was ordered to pay the man €13,000 in damages, almost all he had made from YouTube ads and sales of Techno Viking merchandise, plus €10,000 in court costs, and to cease publication of his image.\n\nThe legal decision put Fritsch into debt. He raised money with a crowdfunding campaign to make a documentary film about the case, \"The Story of Technoviking\", which was released in 2015.\n\n"}

At a young age, Wheeler had an interest in natural history, first being when he observed a moth ensnared in a spiders web; such observation interested Wheeler that he became importunate for more nature lore. Wheeler attended public school, but, due to \"persistently bad behavior\", he was transferred to a local German academy which was known for its extreme discipline. After he completed his courses in the German academy, he attended a German normal school. In both institutions, Wheeler was trained in a variety of subjects: he was given training in languages, philosophy and science. By this time, he could read fluently in French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin and Spanish. While he was a student at the German academy, Wheeler would frequently observe the old museum of natural history at the institution.\n\nIn 1884, Henry August Ward, proprietor of the Ward's Natural Science Establishment, brought a collection of stuffed and skeletonized mammals, birds and reptiles, and also a series of marine invertebrates to the academy. This was to persuade the city fathers to purchase them and combine them with the present collection at the academy, in which it would lay the foundation for a free municipal museum\nof natural history. Wheeler, who had familiarized himself with the museum since childhood, volunteered to spend the nights in helping to unpack and install the specimens. Impressed by his enthusiasm, Ward offered Wheeler a job in his Rochester, New York establishment. His first duties were to identify and list birds and mammals and the preparation of catalogues. He was later made as a foreman and spent most of his time identifying and arranging the collection of shells, echinoderms, and sponges, as well as preparing catalogues and price lists of these specimens for publication.\n\nIn 1885, Wheeler returned to Milwaukee to teach German and physiology at a high school. At the time, George W. Peckham was the principal of the school, in which Wheeler and Peckham formed a close working relationship. Wheeler collaborated with some of Peckham's published papers by illustrating the palpi and epigynes of spiders, and by assisting him and his wife with their field work on wasps. Wheeler was also under the influence of professors C.O. Whitman and Dr. William Pattern, who were embryologists at the Allis Lake Laboratory in Milwaukee. He was inspired by Pattern to study insect embryology and did so for several years. During this time, Wheeler left the high school in 1887 and become a custodian at Milwaukee Public Museum, a position he held until 1890. He studied embryology at home and after work hours, in which he had set up a small laboratory. He left Milwaukee after leaving the museum to assist Whitman at Clark University, and, by 1892, secured a doctorate in philosophy; his dissertation was \"Contribution to Insect Embryology\". At the same time, Wheeler commenced his work on insects and published around 10 entomological papers, which presented himself as a candidate for the degree of Ph.D. After receiving a call from the University of Chicago, Whitman subsequently accepted their offer, followed by Wheeler who was appointed under him as instructor in embryology in 1892. He held this position until 1897, where he became the assistant professor in his chosen field. Before he began his duties at Chicago, Wheeler was given a year's absence, allowing him to study in Europe between 1893 and 1894. There, he first spent time at the Zoological Institute at the University of Wiirzburg as a student, and also at the Naples Zoological Station. Enamoured by the fauna of Naples, Wheeler studied the sex life of \"Myzostoma\", a subject he further studied at the Institut Zoologique at Liege, Belgium. His monograph on \"Myzostoma\" was published in 1897 by professor E. Van Beneden in the \"Archives de Biologie\".\n\nWheeler returned to Chicago in 1894 and was a teacher of embryology for five years. He continued to publish more papers, half of which involved insects. Wheeler married his wife Dora Bay Emerson in 1898, where they both met each other in Chicago previously. In 1899, he was offered the \"Professorship In Zoology\" following the death of professor Norman of the University of Texas. There, he took the opportunity to reorganize the department as professor of zoology. He remained there until 1903, but during this period was when Wheeler developed an interest in the behavior and classification of ants. The ants would eventually become the predominant group of insects he studied. His two children were also born in Rockford, Illinois while he was staying in Texas.\n\nA number of students sought to study under Wheeler; notable entomologists such as C. T. Brues and A. L. Melander made their way to Austin and spent several years studying there in his labaratory. This began an influx of young students, both who were pupils and scientific associates, to study and research for long periods of time under his guidance. Other students include C. L. Metcalf, T. D. Mitchell, O. E. Plath, George Salt, Alfred C. Kinsey, George C. Wheeler, Frank M. Carpenter, William S. Creighton, Neal A. Weber, J. G. Myers, William M. Mann, Marston Bates and Philip J. Darlington.\n\nIn 1903, Wheeler resigned from his position at the University of Texas and accepted the position \"Curator of Invertebrate Zoology\" at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\n\nA close contact of the British myrmecologist and coleopterist Horace Donisthorpe, it was to Wheeler whom Donisthorpe dedicated his first major book on ants in 1915. Donisthorpe and Wheeler also frequently exchanged specimens, leading the latter to first develop the idea that the Formicinae subfamily had its origins in North America.\n\nFor his work, \"Ants of the American Museum Congo Expedition\", Wheeler was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1922. He was professor of applied biology at Harvard University's Bussey Institute, which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States.\n\nIn 1924 he spent about two months in Panama with Dr. Nathan Banks, collecting invertebrates around Barro Colorado and along the railroad in the vicinity of Panama City.\nWheeler led the Harvard Australian Expedition (1931–1932) on behalf of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, a six-man venture sent for the dual purpose of procuring specimens - the museum being \"weak in Australian animals and...desires[ing] to complete its series\" - and to engage in \"the study of the animals of the region when alive.\" The mission was success with over 300 mammal and thousands of insect specimens returning to the United States.\n\nA species of gecko, \"Nephrurus wheeleri\", is named in his honor.\n\nHis work includes 467 titles.\n\n\n"}
