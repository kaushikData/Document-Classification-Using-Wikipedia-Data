Al-Salam is a U.S. Department of the Treasury labeled Specially Designated Global Terrorist and was added to the United Nations and European Union sanctions lists for his association to the al-Qaeda network. Al-Salam has been fighting in Syria since early 2014.\n\nAshraf Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam is a Jordanian national born in Iraq in 1984. Ashraf al-Salam also holds a national identification card from Qatar. It is believed that the founder of Jund al-Aqsa, Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam, is his father and that al-Nusra Front and al-Qaeda supporter ‘Abd al-Malik Muhammad Yusuf Uthman ‘Abd al-Salam is his brother. Ashraf al-Salam’s brother ‘Abd al-Malik al-Salam is also known as Umar al-Qatari.\n\nThe man thought to be his father, Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam, was a Jordanian national of Palestinian descent who was born in Iraq and lived in Qatar. While in Qatar, the suspected father Muhammad al-Salam provided material and logistical support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor group of ISIS. Before founding Jund al-Aqsa, Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam was a longtime veteran of al-Qaeda and is believed to have worked closely with Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Abdullah Azzam.\n\nAshraf al-Salam’s brother, ‘Abd al-Malik al-Salam is also a citizen of Jordan and a holder of Qatari identification.\n\nAshraf al-Salam began working with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2005 while the group was under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. According to the U.S. Treasury, Ashraf supported AQI by opening “stores to facilitate the communications of AQI officials” and assisting in the transfer of thousands of dollars to support AQI operations. Al-Qaeda in Iraq is widely referred to as the predecessor of ISIS.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in early 2012 Ashraf al-Salam facilitated the travel of “associates” to Syria in order to provide training to Syria-based al-Nusra Front members. Also during early 2012, Ashraf al-Salam worked with al-Nusra Front and an “Iraqi explosives expert” in an effort to commit acts of terrorism with explosives.\n\nIn mid-2012, al-Salam worked with Qatari al-Qaeda financier Khalifa Muhammad Turki al-Subaiy to facilitate the transfer of funds intended for al-Qaeda in Pakistan. In 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury listed al-Subaiy in its press release entitled “Gulf-Based al Qaida Financiers” while the UN listed al-Subaiy in 2008 as being associated with al-Qaeda.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Treasury, al-Salam worked with al-Subaiy “to facilitate the transfer of hundreds of thousands of dollars” to Pakistan-based al-Qaeda. The Telegraph covered al-Salam’s connections to al-Subaiy in October 2014. The Telegraph article was later covered in Arabic and appeared on the e-newspaper Bahrain Mirror.\n\nIn September 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice designated Ashraf al-Salam a Specially Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to .\n\nOn January 23, 2015, the UN added Ashraf al-Salam to its ISIL (Da’esh) & Al-Qaida Sanctions List. As a result, al-Salam has been subject to a UN assets freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo as specified in the 2012 Security Council resolution 2083 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter.\n\nIn February 2015, the European Union added al-Salam and three other individuals to a sanctions list against persons and entities associated with the al-Qaeda network.\n\nIn each of the three designations, Ashraf’s brother, ‘Abd al-Malik Muhammad Yusuf Uthman ‘Abd al-Salam, was also listed.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury and UN, Al-Salam has been “a fighter” in Syria since early 2014. It has been presumed that al-Salam is a member of the al-Nusra Front in Syria for his ties to the group.\n"}

Razgon graduated from Lomonosov University in 1948. He was a student and later an associate of N. Rubinstein, a renowned Soviet historian and specialist in the historiography of Russian history.\n\nHe worked as a Senior scientific officer (1952-1962) and later as the Deputy Director for Science (1962-1972) in the Research Institute for Museum Studies in Moscow.\n\nRazgon was the head of the Museum Studies sector at the \"Museum of Revolution\" from 1972 to 1974. He headed the Department of cartography of the State Historical Museum, Moscow, from 1974 to 1988. In 1984, he founded the Department of Museum Studies at the \"All-Union Institute of improvement of professional skills of workers of art and culture\", and was the head of the Department until 1989. He was also lecturing on Museology in the Faculty of History at Lomonosov University and in the Department of Museum Studies of the \"Moscow State Historico-Archival Institute\". In the USSR, he was the first academic to attain the rank of Professor in the Department of Museum Studies (1986).\n\nRazgon was one of the founders of ICOM’s International Committee for museology (ICOFOM) and from 1977 to 1983 was ICOFOM’s Vice President. He participated in the creation of the international Glossary of museum terms \"Dictionarium museologicum\" published in 1983 and 1986.\n\nTogether with museologists from the GDR, Razgon led an international project to write the book “Museum Studies: Historical museums” which was published in 1988 and which was, for many years, the main textbook on museology. In the last decades of his life, Razgon put a lot of energy into the development of the theoretical and methodological foundations of the education of professional museologists.\n\nThe State Historical Museum and other heritage institutions have organized a number of conferences to commemorate his work and ideas for the purpose of the further development of museum theory and practice.\n\nRazgon authored over 100 scientific papers on economic history and museology. His research was based on both printed and archival sources as well as on objects from museum collections, and his writings were devoted to the history of historical, archaeological, military and local lore museums and to the protection of monuments of history and culture in the context of the history of society and development of scientific knowledge. Summarizing these observations, his doctoral dissertation \"Historical museums in Russia in 1861-1917\" (1973) became an important work in the historiography of Russian museology. He directed the preparation of collective writings on the history of museum work entitled: “Essays on the History of museums in Russia and the USSR” (1960-1971) and were among those Razgon published about the state of historical museums and monuments from the 18th century to the year 1917.\n\nSince the mid1970s, Razgon’s scientific interests lay mainly in the field of history and the theory of museum work. Razgon considered that museology was showing “features of an independent scientific branch” that was studying the processes of the preservation of social information, a knowledge of the world and the transfer of knowledge and emotion through museum objects. Razgon was promoting the idea of “museum sources studies”, i.e. museum objects analyzed as a source of information. He was also interested in determining the place of museology in relation to other sciences and fields of knowledge and in the improvement of museological terminology.\n\nRazgon’s idea of “museum sources studies” as a separate area of knowledge was later developed in the writings of Nina P. Finyagina (1930-2000) and Natalia G. Samarina (1958-2011). From their point of view, the main difference between the “museum sources studies” and “historical source studies” lay in the emphasis on semantic information that a museum object carries.\n\n\n"}

He served as the Regent of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha during the minority of his wife’s cousin, Duke Charles Edward, from 1900 to 1905.\n\nBorn in Langenburg, Kingdom of Württemberg on 13 September 1863, Ernst was the oldest of three children, and the only son, of Hermann, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and Princess Leopoldine of Baden, daughter of Prince William of Baden. He was also the grand-nephew of Queen Victoria: i.e., his paternal great-grandmother was Victoria (of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and later by her first marriage of Leiningen), the mother of Queen Victoria, and his grandmother was Feodora of Leiningen, Queen Victoria's half-sister. He married the Queen's granddaughter, Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh, daughter of The Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, on 20 April 1896 at the Ehrenburg Palace (\"Schloss\" Ehrenburg) in Coburg, Germany.\n\nAfter finishing high school in Karlsruhe, the young prince studied law in Paris, Bonn, Tübingen and Leipzig, where he graduated in 1885 with the first legal exam in Naumburg. He also gained membership in the Corps Suevia Tübingen (1st Class) in 1884, when he was at the University of Tübingen and Borussia Bonn in 1886, because he had gone to the University of Bonn. After his officer training in Berlin-Lichterfelde (1886-1891), he passed the diplomatic examination (1890-1891) with the appointment as Secretary of the Imperial German Embassy in St. Petersburg and London (1891-1894). In the following years he worked in Strasbourg as an assistant for his father, Prince Hermann, the Imperial Governor of Alsace-Lorraine, and prepared himself for his future as a Peer of the Kingdom of Württemberg.\n\nBecause his wife was the daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Ernst became the Regent of the Duchy after the death of the Duke. From 30 July 1900 to 18 July 1905, he governed Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on the behalf of the still immature successor, Charles Edward. In 1901, Ernst was awarded with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Württemberg. Afterwards, he made several unsuccessful attempts to gain a foothold in the politics of the German Empire. He served as the Head of the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office (1906–1906) and the Deputy (1907–1911) and Vice President (1909–1910) of the \"Reichstag\". In 1913, on the death of his father, Ernst became the Prince of Hohelohe-Langeburg, entitling him to sit in the \"Kammer der Standesherren\" [House of Lords] of Württemberg, where he had already been serving as his father’s deputy since 1895. He would keep his seat until the November Revolution of 1918. During the First World War, the Prince was active as a volunteer in the military hospitals as well as the General Delegate to the Eastern Front and Imperial Commissioner and military inspector. He was also sent in 1915 as a special envoy to Constantinople and the Balkans.\n\nAfter Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Ernst joined his son (who had already entered in 1931) in the Nazi Party with the membership number of 3726902.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Ernst retired to private life. His wife, who suffered from various illnesses died in 1942. Ernst was dedicated to church and nursing activities and was a member of the German Evangelical Church Assembly (the \"Kirchentag\"), Commander of the \"Württemberg-Badenschen Genossenschaft\" (Württemberg-Baden Cooperative), Governor of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg Order of St. John, Honorary President of the Württemberg State Association of the Red Cross as well as of the Evangelical People’s League of Württemberg (\"Evangelischen Volksbund für Württemberg\"). On 11 December 1950, Ernst died at the age 87 at Langenburg, Baden-Württemberg, in what was then West Germany.\n\nThe children of Prince Ernst and Princess Alexandra of Hohelohe-Langenburg were descended from both Queen Victoria and Victoria's half-sister Feodora of Leiningen.

{"id": "152640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152640", "title": "Fan (person)", "text": "Fan (person)\n\nA fan, or fanatic, sometimes also termed aficionado or supporter, is a person who is enthusiastically devoted to something or somebody, such as a singer or band, a sports team, a genre, a politician, a book, a movie or an entertainer. Collectively, the fans of a particular object or person constitute its fanbase or fandom. They may show their enthusiasm in a variety of ways, such as by promoting the object of their interest, being members of a fan club, holding or participating in fan conventions, or writing fan mail. They may also engage in creative activities (\"fan labor\") such as creating fanzines, writing fan fiction, making memes or drawing fan art.\n\nMerriam-Webster, the Oxford dictionary and other sources define \"fan\" as a shortened version of the word \"fanatic\". \"Fanatic\" itself, introduced into English around 1550, means \"marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense uncritical devotion\". It comes from the Modern Latin \"fanaticus\", meaning \"insanely but divinely inspired\". The word originally pertained to a temple or sacred place [Latin \"fanum\", poetic English \"fane\"]. The modern sense of \"extremely zealous\" dates from around 1647; the use of \"fanatic\" as a noun dates from 1650. However, the term \"fancy\" for an intense liking of something (a usage attested by 1545), while being of a different etymology, coincidentally carries a less intense but somewhat similar connotation to \"fanatic\". Use of \"the fancy\" to mean avid sports enthusiasts emerged as an Americanism in the mid-19th C. \"The Dickson Baseball Dictionary\" cites William Henry Nugent's work asserting that it was derived from \"the fancy\", a term referring to the fans of a specific hobby or sport from the early 18th century to the 19th, especially to the followers of boxing. According to that theory, it was originally shortened to \"fance\" then just to the homonym \"fans\". \"The Great American Baseball Scrapbook\" attributes the term to Chris Von der Ahe, owner of the Saint Louis Brown Stockings in 1882. Von der Ahe sold tickets for 25 cents, hoping the many patrons would purchase his beer; the low ticket price helped him lead the stats in attendance. He called the fanatics filling his stands \"fans\". \n\n\"Supporter\" is a synonym to \"fan\" that predates the latter term and is still commonly used in British English, especially to denote fans of sports teams. However, the term \"fan\" has become popular throughout the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom. The term \"supporter\" is also used in a political sense in the United States, to a fan of a politician, a political party, and a controversial issue.\n\nFans usually have a strong enough interest that some changes in their lifestyles are made to accommodate devotion to the focal object. Fans have a desire for external involvement – they are motivated to demonstrate their involvement with the area of interest through certain behaviors (attending conventions, posting online, displaying team banners outside their homes, etc.). Fans often have a \"wish to acquire\" material objects related to the area of interest, such as a baseball hit by a famous slugger or a used guitar pick from their musical hero. As well, some fans have a desire for social interaction with other fans. This again may take many forms, from casual conversation, e-mail, chat rooms, and electronic mailing lists to regular face-to-face meetings such as fan club meetings and organized conventions.\n\nThere are several groups of fans that can be differentiated by the intensity level of their level of involvement or interest in the hobby (level of fanaticism) The likelihood for a subject of interest to be elevated to the level of fandom appears to be dictated by its complexity. Complexity allows further involvement of fans for a longer period of time because of the time needed to work the subject of interest 'out.' It also contributes to a greater sense of belonging because of the mental effort invested in the subject.\n\nThese fans will often hold a crush on a major movie star, pop star, athlete or celebrity (see teen idol). The groupie is an example, a fan of a particular band or musician, who will follow them on concert tours. The degree of devotion to celebrities can range from a simple crush to the deluded belief that they have a special relationship with the star which does not exist. In extreme cases, this can lead to celebrity worship syndrome, stalking behavior. This can easily switch to hatred of the previously loved celebrity, and result in attempts at violent attacks, one notable incident being the death of Rebecca Schaeffer by a stalking fan in 1989.\n\nThis is somewhat related to the concept of parasocial interaction where audiences develop one-sided relationships with media characters and celebrities.\n\nGaming fans, or \"gamers\", are fans focused on playing non-sport games, usually role-playing games, board games, miniature wargames, collectible card games or video games.\n\nMusic fans can differ somewhat from fans of particular musicians, in that they may focus on a genre of music. Many of the trade journals around music, such as \"Rolling Stone\", were created by music fans. A notable music fan was groupie Cynthia Plaster Caster, famous for making numerous plaster casts of rock stars' penises. Another was Pamela Des Barres, author of the book \"\". Fans who are not groupies prefer the term \"supporter\".\n\nPopular musicals have their own particular sets of fans. \"Rent\" has boasted a sizable number of 'Rentheads' since its Broadway debut, and likewise those devoted to \"The Phantom of the Opera\" dub themselves 'Phans'.\n\n\"Otaku\" is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests. In Japan, the term is normally derogatory, a connotation lacking in English, where it generally refers to people in the anime and manga fandom.\n\nPeople who approve of or associate themselves with certain politicians or political groups are generally called \"supporters\" rather than \"fans\", although there are politicians with official or unofficial \"fan clubs\". Intense and organized support for a politician may be referred to as a personality cult, particularly in authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\n\nFans of professional wrestling can be divided into two groups: marks and smarks. Derived from the same term for the prey of conmen, a mark is a fan who believes that everything associated with professional wrestling is real. In contrast, a \"smark\" is a fan who recognizes that they are witnessing a stage-managed work (\"kayfabe\"), but appreciates it nonetheless, including its backstage aspects.\n\nSince the 1920s, an increasingly elaborate sub-culture of organized science fiction fandom has arisen, initially among correspondents to the letter columns of science fiction magazines. This non-centralized movement has given birth to science fiction fanzines (and amateur press associations), science fiction conventions, the Hugo Awards (and various imitators/derivatives), filk music, \"fan funds\" such as the Trans Atlantic Fan Fund, and a variety of other institutions, jargon and customs. It has nurtured writers and artists such as Ray Bradbury, Roger Ebert, Lenny Kaye, Michael Moorcock and Trina Robbins; and has generated such spin-offs as comic book fandom, media fandom, the Society for Creative Anachronism, gaming fandom, and furry fandom, sometimes collectively referred to as \"fringe fandoms\".\n\nScience fiction fandom developed its own slang, known as fanspeak after the \"Newspeak\" of the novel \"Nineteen Eighty-four\". Fanspeak is made up of acronyms, blended words, obscure in-jokes, puns, coinages from science fiction novels or films, and archaic or standard English words used in specific ways relevant or amusing to the science fiction community. Some fanspeak terms, like fanzine have become standard English. Some fanspeak terms relate to fans themselves:\n\nSpecific sub-groups of science fiction fandom are often known by a collection term. For example:\n\nA sports fan can be an enthusiast for a particular athlete, team, sport, or all of organized sports as a whole. Sports fans often attend sporting events in stadiums, in sports bars, or watch them at home on television, and follow news through newspapers, websites, and social media.\n\nThe mentality of the sports fan is often such that they will experience a game, or event while living vicariously through players or teams whom the fan favors. This behavior manifests itself in a number of different ways, depending on the venue. At a stadium or arena, sports fans will voice their pleasure with a particular incident, player, or team by cheering, which consists of clapping, fist-pumping, or shouting positive exclamations toward the field of play and ultimately, the favorable object. Likewise, displeasure toward a particular incident, player, or team may be met by fans with booing, shouting of expletives, and sometimes throwing of objects onto the field. This violent type of fan reaction is often called hooliganism.\n\nLighter, more harmless objects are also occasionally thrown onto certain fields of play as a form of celebration of a favorable sports feat. This is most common when a member of the home team scores a hat trick in hockey. Other, more mild forms of displeasure shown by sports fans at sporting events involve simple groans of disappointment, and silence. These actions often denote that the favored home team is being outperformed by, or has lost to the much less-favored road team.\n\nIn North America, extremely enthusiastic fans are often called \"superfans\": fans who dress up in outrageous and ostentatious costumes or outfits showing their devotion. Fanbases well known for their tenacious love and undying support are called \"rabid fans\" or fanatics. These fans often congregate hours before kickoff in what is known as a tailgation or tailgating.\n\nAt sports bars, sports fans will gather together, often while consuming food and alcoholic beverages, with the purpose of following a particular sporting event on television as a group. Sports bars often advertise in hopes of drawing fans of a particular player or team to watch together to increase bonds between fans and prevent fights. This can create the sense of unity in a sports bar as all cheers and boos will appear to be synchronized due to similar feelings and reactions by nearly all fans at the fortunes and misfortunes of the favored team or athlete. Due to the level of devotion and intensity of feeling towards the favored team or athlete by sports bar patrons, as well as partially due to the alcohol being served, behavior that would be seen as unruly or fanatical outside a sports bar is generally more common inside of one. The intensity of cheering and jeering at a sports bar by sports fans can often range from equal to stronger than that of fans actually at the sporting event for particularly significant games and matches.\n\nAt home, sports fans may have few fellow fans but also more freedom. This is sometimes where the most intense cheering or jeering will take place. In the fan's own home, unbridled and lengthy screaming, crying, acts of destruction to household objects, and other manifestations of joy or anguish, are perhaps seen as most acceptable in comparison to the sports bar or sporting venue simply because such acts taken to such an extreme can be seen as disruptive to a large number of fellow fans even if they share the same sentiment if it is of less intensity. The greatest variables of the reaction of a sports fan in their own home are the intensity of the fan's desire to see their team win or perform well, and the presence of another: often a wife, children, or friends who may be significantly less ardent sports fans or not sports fans at all, which may significantly temper the fan's reaction to a highly positive or negative moment due to the fear of causing a scene or scaring those close to the fan, or alienating themselves from said others. Often sports fans will invite other fans of relatively similar rooting intensity over to their house to experience a sporting event together so that all involved can voice pleasure or displeasure to their heart's content and increase shared bonds in the process. It is becoming common for this type of bonding to take place over sports-related social networks like eFans.\n\nThe drivers that make people fans, and in particular sports fans, have been studied by psychologists, such as Dan Wann at Murray State University, and communication scholars, such as Adam Earnheardt at Youngstown State University.\n\nThey attribute people becoming fans to the following factors: One element is entertainment, because sports spectatorship is a form of leisure. Sports is also a form of escapism, and being a fan gives one an excuse to yell at something, an activity that may be constrained in other areas of one's life. Fan activities give participants a combination of euphoria and stress (about the potential for their team to lose) for which they coin the name \"eustress\". Fans experience euphoria during moments when play is going well for their team, and stress when play is going against their team. This tension between the two emotions generates an unusual sense of pleasure or heightened sensations.\n\nAesthetics are another draw for some fans, who appreciate the precision or skill of play, or of the coordinated movement of the players during a pre-planned \"play\". Family bonding is a reason for some fan activities. Some families watch televised sports on a regular basis and go to sports games as a family outing to watch events and form a psychological bond with one another and as a family. Going to sports events can create a borrowed sense of self-esteem if fans identify with their teams to the extent that they consider themselves to be successful when their teams have been successful (e.g., as seen in the phrase \"we have won\"). If a fan identifies strongly with a favorite team, they will respond to the performance of the team as if team success were a personal success and team failure a personal failure.\n\nFan loyalty is the loyalty felt and expressed by a fan towards the object of his/her fanaticism. Allegiances can be strong or weak. The loyalties of sports fans have been studied by psychologists and have often been reviewed.\n\nFangirls and fanboys in fandoms sometimes, with various meanings, consider their fandom to be their \"family,\" and feel very loyal to it, usually.\n\nA stan is a particularly (perhaps excessively) avid fan and supporter of a celebrity, TV show, group, or a film or film series. The object of the stan's affection is often called their \"fave\". Based on the 2000 song \"Stan\" by American rapper Eminem, the term has frequently been used to describe artist devotees whose fanaticism matches the severity of the obsessive character in the song. The word has been described as a blend of \"stalker\" and \"fan\". A website known as \"Stan Wars\" or \"stanipedia\" sprouted up to host discussions and flame wars between rival fanbases.\n\nColloquially, the term can be used as both a noun or a verb. Stans of a particular singer are often given more detailed names, such as \"Arianators\" for fans of Ariana Grande and \"Belieber\" for fans of Justin Bieber. Some artists, however, do not have specific titles attributed to their stans; fans of Kylie Minogue have been called Kylie Stans. Even for fandoms with specific titles, the \"artist stan\" formula still applies.\n\nSome of these monikers are almost universally known and used by fans of the artists as well as outsiders. Other nicknames are not commonly used, neither by outsiders nor by the concerning fan-base, such as Kylie Minogue's so called \"Kylie Stans\", Madonna's so called \"Madonna Fans\" Maroon 5's so called \"Maroon 5 Stans\" or Nick Jonas's so called \"Nick Jonas Fans\" usually appearing on social media networks such as Twitter and Tumblr, The term \"stan\" is also used to describe fans of K-pop. The term is not to be confused with Sasaeng fans, which are overly obsessed fans who stalk and sometimes bring harm to idols. Stans, however, are merely highly dedicated fans.\n\nThe term was added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 2017.\n\nCelebrities have positively reacted to their \"stan\" followings. Notably, English singer-songwriter Jessie J had this to say about her stans, \"They support me and buy my albums and singles, and they stand outside hotels, and they come to shows, and they get tattoos of my lyrics and they cut their hair like me. You have to love your fans. That's why I call them my Heartbeats, because without them I wouldn't be here\". In 2012, a stan for Jessie J broke her leg to emulate her own leg injury. The fan tracked down Jessie J's personal address and sent her a photograph of the self-inflicted injury. The singer was horrified and decided to increase her security.\n\nSinger-songwriter Lorde has a different opinion on the matter of giving her followers a nickname. She discouraged it by saying \"I find it grating to lump everyone into a really awkward, pun-centric name\" and affirmed she will never name her fanbase.\n\nFanboys are frequently portrayed as \"angry nerds\", over-aggressive, derogatory, and protective of the object of their obsession, or as bespectacled, geekoid, obsessive male fans. The term nerd, defined as \"[an] insignificant, foolish, or socially inept person; a person who is boringly conventional or studious; a person who pursues an unfashionable or highly technical interest with obsessive or exclusive dedication,\" as well as the term geek, defined as \"[a] person […] who is regarded as foolish, offensive, worthless; an overly diligent, unsociable student; any unsociable person obsessively devoted to a particular pursuit,\" are often used to describe stereotypical fanboys. In regards to chosen fandoms, they are typically associated with comic books, video games, science fiction movies or television series, or technology (such as computer or smartphone brands).\n\nAn exception to this portrayal is the sports fan, who is expected to be overtly sexual, and aggressive. This portrayal is particularly dominant within the sports arena, which provides a legitimate site for men to act in hyper masculinized ways. According to Williams, \"Many [men] want to be overtly sexist and racist. They need to have this exaggerated sense of their sexuality to defend themselves from potential accusations that they are not real men.\"\n\nAccording to Jackson Katz in the documentary \"Tough Guise 2\", boys are taught early on that to be \"real men\" they need to be tough and not to show their feelings.\n\n[Men] can't show any emotion except anger. We can't think too much or seem too intellectual. We can't back down when someone disrespects us. We have to show we're tough enough to inflict physical pain and take it in turn. We're supposed to be sexually aggressive with women. And then we're taught that if we step out of this box, we risk being seen as soft, weak, feminine, or gay.\n\nHe later elaborates, stating that, \nQualities like compassion, caring, empathy, intellectual curiosity, fear, vulnerability, even love – basic human qualities that boys have inside them every bit as much as girls do – get methodically driven out of them by a sexist and homophobic culture that labels these things as 'unmanly,' 'feminine,' 'womanly,' and 'gay,' and teaches boys to avoid them at all costs.\n\nAnd, most importantly, they're taught that real men turn to violence not as a last resort, but as the go-to method of resolving disputes – and also as a primary means of winning respect and establishing masculine credibility.\n\nIn the predecessor to this documentary, \"Tough Guise\", Katz also addresses the issue of body image, using multiple movies, such as \"Terminator\" and \"Rambo\", as well as action figures like GI Joe, to illustrate how 'real men' are defined as big, strong, and muscular.\n\nFanboy portrayals, by definition, do not fit into this mold of a 'real man', with the exception of sports fans. In a study by Gerard Jones on comic book fans, he described the comic book fanboys as \"small, anxious, withdrawn, and terrified of the opposite sex.\" Quite the opposite of the 'real man' previously described by Katz. Their interests may also be considered as a deviation from societal gender roles, according to Noah Berlastsky, such as playing \"Dungeons and Dragons\" instead of football. This lack of traditional masculine traits warrants them much teasing from peers, parental figures, coaches, or older male role models for not conforming to these ideas of masculinity. A popular example of such treatment in mainstream media is shown on the sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\", where, multiple times throughout the show's run, the four main characters, portrayed as 'nerdy fanboys', are humiliated by larger 'real men'. For instance, in the show pilot, the two main characters, Leonard and Sheldon, get their pants taken by the main female character's ex-boyfriend, who is portrayed as big, strong, tough, confident, and successful with women.\n\nFurthermore, fanboys also deal with issues of gender discrimination in relation to their fandom interests. For example, Bronies, a group of young men enthralled by the TV show \"\", a show typically geared towards young girls, are often the target of ridicule. Their interest in a 'feminine' media item can be the cause of great shame, causing many to become 'private' bronies, enjoying the show in secret out of fear.\n\nFanboys are often portrayed as quite angry, violent, and offensive while defending the objects of their affection, such as the smartphone fanboys who frequently verbally attack anybody saying anything the slightest bit offensive about their chosen technological product through online anonymous sites. In fact, the term 'fanboy' is often used as an insult towards other fans, deemed unreasonable, arrogant, or overly loyal to their chosen token of affection.\n\nSuch defensiveness is particularly prominent against women who are interested in their chosen fandoms or who pose a \"threat\" to their community. For example, in 2012, male gamers created a Flash game in which players could physically assault Anita Sarkeesian, a woman who launched a Kickstarter to create a series of documentaries on women tropes in video games.\n\nThese violent acts against Sarkeesian continued in 2014, during the controversial event or movement known as GamerGate, during which Sarkeesian received numerous threats by fanboys due to her Tropes vs Women series on YouTube, where she analyzes the alleged limited and sexist female roles available in video games. These threats escalated dangerously, requiring her to leave her home in fear for her safety, as well as cancel a speaking engagement at Utah State University after there were threats of a mass shooting on campus due to her presence. Such discriminatory acts of violence towards women are not isolated cases. For instance, male comic book fans frequently harass women frequenting comic book shops, either by demeaning them or by hitting on them, causing them to feel uncomfortable and excluded from the fan community.\n\nFangirls are often portrayed as teenagers obsessed with something to a frightening degree. The term is often used in a demeaning, derogatory fashion to describe the fans that give \"normal\" fans a bad name. In fact, the term \"fangirling\" is used to describe anyone who obsessively follows a certain fandom to the point where it interferes with their daily lives. Such a trend of 'authentic' versus 'inauthentic' fan is common within fan communities, and is particularly pertinent to gender discrimination and misogynistic ideals. However, on the other hand of the spectrum, some fangirls have embraced the title, considering it a compliment rather than a derogatory term.\n\nWomen tend to be \"more restricted in their leisure choices and opportunities than men,\" and their experiences within fandoms are typically demeaned to a more sexualized, emotional, or bodily experience, as opposed to intellectual interests. For example, in music, women are more predominant, and accepted, within pop music fandoms, which Diane Railton describes as evoking an emotional and physical response, in contrast with the 'masculine' rock music, which is defined as 'serious' music with a 'meaning', focusing on political, cultural, and psychological discussion. Due to this, women are rarely given space or voice within the intellectual realm of music. According to Frank Zappa, \"men come to hear the music and chicks come for the sex thrills,\" implying that women's involvement in fan communities is purely sexual, and that they are incapable of displaying intellectual or artistic interest in the music itself. Those who do manage to become involved within the world of 'serious' music are often relegated to the realm of a 'groupie'. A groupie, according to Cheryl Cline, is\n\n[A] person (a woman, usually), who 'chases after' rock stars, as my mother would say. But 'groupie' is also used more or less synonymously with 'girl Rock fan', 'female journalist', and 'woman Rock musician'; it's used to mean anyone working in the music field who isn't actually a Rock musician; it's used as an all-purpose insult and a slut on one's professionalism; it's used as a cute term for 'hero worship'; and it's used interchangeably with 'fan'.\n\nIn other words, the term 'groupie' (used synonymously with the term 'fan' or 'fangirl') is frequently used to shame women involved within the music community, restricting their involvement to sexual relations with band members or worshipping male rock stars.\n\nThis trend can also be observed within other fan communities, such as comic book fandoms, where women are frequently portrayed as \"Fake Geek Girls\", only interested in comic books to impress guys or to view the attractive men present within their content, or sports communities, where women are often made uncomfortable at live sporting events due to the overt sexism and aggressive masculinity displayed by male spectators, and then labelled as 'inauthentic' for viewing the games via television instead. Within hockey, female fans are often called \"Puck Bunnies\", defined as,\n\n[S]omeone who hangs around the players, always on the lookout for the chance to get that autograph / photograph / quick pint [drink] / quick knee trem-bler round the back of the Arena from the player or players (or even coach) of their choice, heck let's face it even the water carrier is in with a chance here.\n\nSuch discrimination against female fans can become violent at times in an effort to police \"authenticity\". The recent events known as GamerGate provide a good example of such attacks, whereby multiple women working within the gaming industry were victims of sexual harassment and violent threats, some even forced to leave their homes for fear of a physical confrontation.\n\nIn terms of their involvement within fandoms, fangirls are typically portrayed as losing all control, fainting, sobbing, and dashing about in mobs. For instance, while describing the phenomenon of Beatlemania, fan activity is described by stating that: \nThe appropriate reaction to contact with [the Beatles] – such as occupying the same auditorium or city block – was to sob uncontrollably while screaming, 'I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die,' or, more optimistically, the name of a favorite Beatle, until the onset of either unconsciousness or laryngitis. Girls peed in their pants, fainted, or simply collapsed from the emotional strain.\n\nThe fangirls' so-called 'hysteria' is described as the product of sexual repression. However, while it is expected for women to be involved in certain fandoms for physical or sexual reasons, this is also viewed as undesirable and driven by hormonal changes.\n\nThese acts of adoration are societally limited to adolescent youth, or menopausal women, in both instances blaming \"these two periods of hormonal lunacy\" on the irrational, overtly sexual behaviour. For instance, Cheryl Cline, in her text entitled \"Essays from Bitch: The Women's Rock Newsletter with Bite\", discusses how women need to keep their interests hidden once they pass adolescence. In her own words, \"[i]t's a sign of maturity to pack up all the posters, photos, magazines, scrapbooks, and unauthorized biographies you so lovingly collected and shove them in the back of the closet. Furthermore, while discussing Beatlemania and the crazed Beatles fangirl behaviour, Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Heiss, and Gloria Jacobs mention how the 'only cure' for what was at the time considered an affliction was age, and that similarly to \"the girls who had screamed for Frank Sinatra,\" the Beatles fangirls would \"[grow] up to be responsible, settled housewives.\"\n\nThese conflicting accounts of fangirl behaviour are due to the belief that women are not supposed to express such sexual fantasies unless influenced by some hormonal induced craziness, while for men it is normal to be sexual regardless of age. As Cheryl Cline summarizes, \nIt's much easier for a man to be indulgent about the crushes of teenage girls than it is for him to be fair-minded about the sexual fantasies of the woman he loves when they're about someone else. And the same guy who'll leave \"Penthouse\" in the bathroom will yell, 'No woman of mine is gonna hang a poster of Prince naked to the waist on the inside of the closet of the spare room where no one will see it!' […] [U]ntil you reach the age when everybody thinks you're crazy anyway, so why not admit to an intense hankering to run your fingers through Willie Nelson's whiskers?\n\n\n\n"}

They are the patron saints of Milan and of haymakers and are invoked for the discovery of thieves. Their feast day in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church is 19 June, the day marking the translation of their relics. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and in the Eastern Rites of the Catholic Church, their feast takes place on 14 October (O.S.)/24 October (N.S.), the traditional day of their death. In Christian iconography their emblems are the scourge, the club and the sword.\n\nThe \"acta\" may have been expanded from a letter (\"Epistle\" liii) to the bishops of Italy, falsely ascribed to Saint Ambrose. They are written in a very simple style; it has not been possible to establish the date of their composition. According to these, Gervasius and Protasius were the twin sons of martyrs. Their father, Saint Vitalis of Milan, a man of consular dignity, suffered martyrdom at Ravenna, possibly under Nero. Their mother, Saint Valeria, died for her faith at Milan. Gervasius and Protasius were imprisoned, and visited in prison by Saint Nazarius.\n\nThe sons are said to have large hands and had been scourged and then beheaded, during the reign of the Emperor Nero, under the presidency of Anubinus or Astasius, and while Caius was Bishop of Milan. Some authors place the martyrdom under the Emperor Diocletian, but others object to this time, because it is not clear how, in that case, the place of burial, and even the names, could be forgotten by the time of Saint Ambrose, as is stated. It probably occurred during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180).\n\nSaint Ambrose, in 386, had built a magnificent basilica at Milan, now called the Basilica Sant'Ambrogio. Asked by the people to consecrate it in the same solemn manner as was done in Rome, he promised to do so if he could obtain the necessary relics. In a dream, he was shown the place where such relics could be found. He ordered excavations to be made outside the city, in the cemetery Church of Saints Nabor and Felix, who were at the time the primary patrons of Milan, and there found the relics of Saints Gervasius and Protasius. In a letter, St Ambrose wrote: \"I found the fitting signs, and on bringing in some on whom hands were to be laid, the power of the holy martyrs became so manifest, that even whilst I was still silent, one was seized and thrown prostrate at the holy burial-place. We found two men of marvelous stature, such as those of ancient days. All the bones were perfect, and there was much blood.\"\n\nSt Ambrose had their relics removed to the Basilica of Fausta (now the Church of Saints Vitalis and Agricola), and on the next day into the basilica, accompanied in the texts by many miracles, emblematic of divine favor in the context of the great struggle then taking place between St Ambrose and the Arian Empress Justina. Of the vision, the subsequent discovery of the relics and the accompanying miracles, St Ambrose wrote to his sister Marcellina.\n\nSaint Augustine, not yet baptized, witnessed these facts, and relates them in his \"Confessions\" (IX, vii), and in \"De Civitate Dei\" (XXII, viii) as well as in his \"Sermon 286 in natal. Ss. Mm. Gerv. et Prot.\". They are also attested by Saint Paulinus in his life of Saint Ambrose. The latter died in 397 and by his own wish was buried in his basilica by the side of these martyrs. It has been suggested that the Brescia Casket was made for or used to hold the relics.\n\nJ. Rendel Harris, in \"The Dioscuri in the Christian Legends\" (London, 1903), addressed the subject of twin saints in Christian legend, who seem to be connected with the Dioscuri, whose cult was tenacious, surmised from an oration decrying their veneration by Dio Chrystostom (\"Orations\" 61.11). The historicity of Gervasius and Protasius was defended in the \"Analecta Bollandist.\" (1904), XXIII, 427.\n\nImmediately after the discovery of the relics by Saint Ambrose, the cult of Saints Gervasius and Protasius was spread in Italy, and churches were built in their honor at Pavia, Nola and other places. In Gaul (modern-day France), about 400 churches were dedicated to them, at Mans, Rouen and Soissons. At the Louvre in Paris, there is now a famous picture of the saints by Lesueur (d. 1655), which was formerly in their church at Paris. According to the \"Liber Pontificalis,\" Pope Innocent I (402-417) dedicated a church to them at Rome. Later, the name of St Vitalis, their father, was added to the title of this church (Basilica of San Vitale). Very early on, their names were inserted into the Litany of the Saints.\n\nIn 835, Angilbert II, Bishop of Milan, placed the relics of the three saints in a porphyry sarcophagus, where they were found in January 1864.\n\nA tradition claims that, after the destruction of Milan by Frederick Barbarossa, his chancellor, Rainald of Dassel, had taken the relics from Milan and deposited them at Breisach in Germany, whence some came to Soissons. The claim is rejected by Milan.\n\nNevertheless, they were venerated by farmers in Germany and a German saying amongst harvesters was: \"Wenn's regnet auf Gervasius / es vierzig Tage regnen muss\" (\"When it rains on St Gervasius' Day / forty days of rain will follow\"). Thus, as with the cults of Saint Swithun, Saint Medard, the Seven Sleepers, and Saint Godelieve, that of Sts Gervasius and Protasius was connected with the weather.\n\nA famous series of tapestries of the \"Life of Gervasius and Protasius,\" donated to the Cathedral of Antwerp in 1509, is displayed in the cathedral's choir.\n\n\n\n"}

He began his career playing dashing juvenile leads, later specialising in Shakespearean roles, modern comedy and melodrama. His most famous role was as Bob Brierley in Tom Taylor's \"The Ticket-of-Leave Man\". As the manager of the Olympic Theatre from 1873 to 1879, he presented numerous successful productions. In later years, he became a respected character actor.\n\nNeville was born in Manchester, England, son of John Garside Neville and his second wife Mary Anna, \"née\" Gartside (died 1895). He was the twentieth child of his father, an actor and the manager of Queen's Theatre, Spring Gardens, Manchester, who himself was the twentieth child of \"his\" father. Though Neville senior was in the theatre, there were strong military traditions on both sides of the family, and John Neville was opposed to his son's decision to pursue a theatrical rather than a military career and refused to help him. Neville had one brother, George (born c. 1839), one sister, Josaphine (c. 1838–1895), and nineteen half-brothers and sisters.\nFrom 1857 to 1860 Neville acted in the English provinces and Scotland. When the tragedian John Vandenhoff made his farewell performance in 1858 at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, Neville played Cromwell to Vandenhoff's Wolsey in Shakespeare's \"King Henry VIII\". He made his London debut in 1860 as Percy Ardent in Dion Boucicault's \"The Irish Heiress\" at the Lyceum Theatre. \"The Observer\" said of his performance: \"Mr Henry Neville, a new importation from Liverpool, was gentlemanly and easy, of good manners and dashing appearance; and he promises to fill a dreary gap in the London theatrical world – the line of \"jeunes premières\".\" He attracted further good notices for his next role, in \"The Love Chase\", receiving encouragement from \"The Times\" \"as a representative of young men of something like rank and position.\" The same year, he played Victor Savignie in \"Arrienne\" at the Lyceum and, at the Olympic Theatre, he played Ivan in \"Serf\" and Valjean in an adaptation of \"Les Miserables\".\n\nIn May 1863, still at the Olympic, Neville created the role of Bob Brierley in Tom Taylor's drama about the dismal life of a released convict, \"The Ticket-of-Leave Man\", a character in which he made the success of his career. He played in its long first run and revivals for a total of about 2000 performances. In 1865, he played the title role in Taylor's \"Henry Dunbar\" at the Olympic opposite Kate Terry, and in 1867 was her chosen Romeo to her Juliet in her farewell London performances at the Adelphi Theatre. 1867 had been a busy year for Neville at the Adelphi, where he played Job Arnroyd in \"Lost in London\", Benedick in \"Much Ado About Nothing\", Dunbar again, Farmer Allan in \"Dora\", Richard Watt in \"His First Champagne\", Claude Meinotee in \"Lady of Lyons\", Walter Maidenblush in \"Little Treasure\", Sir Thomas Clifford in \"Hunchback\", and George Vendale in \"No Thoroughfare\", another notable success. The next year at the Adelphi, he played the title role in \"Hamlet\" and repeated Robert Brierley. In 1869, still at the Adelphi, he portrayed the role of Vernon Wainwright in \"Eve\". At the Gaiety Theatre in the same year, he played an important role in W. S. Gilbert's early comedy, \"An Old Score\".\n\nNeville continued building his reputation on the London stage in the 1870s as actor and also as the manager of the Olympic Theatre from 1873 to 1879, where his company included rising actors such as Rutland Barrington, Helen Ernstone, Emily Fowler and Johnston Forbes-Robertson. In 1870, he played Henry Little in \"Put Yourself in His Place\" at the Adelphi. In 1872 he had a great success in \"The School for Scandal\" of which \"The Times\" said, \"Mr Henry Neville is the leading actor in the class of characters in which Charles Surface is comprised.\" This was followed, at the Olympic, by \"The School for Intrigue\", in which he played the part of Almaviva. Other successes during the 1870s, both as manager and actor, included his portrayal of Lord Clancarty in Taylor's \"Lady Clancarty\", Pierre in John Oxenford's \"The Two Orphans\" in 1874, an 1874–75 revival of \"The Ticket-of-Leave Man\", and Franklin Blake in a dramatisation of Wilkie Collins's \"The Moonstone\" in 1877. In the same year he produced and starred in a revival of \"Lady Audley's Secret\" by Robert Walters. He also produced W. S. Gilbert's plays \"The Ne'er-do-Weel\" in 1878 and \"Gretchen\" in 1879.\nIn 1878, Neville opened a successful drama school which he managed for many years. By the 1880s, he had become famous in melodrama roles, playing the romantic lead. His Shakespeare roles included Jaques in \"As You Like It\", produced by Madame Modjeska (1882) and Leonato in \"Much Ado About Nothing\". In 1888, he played Count Heidegger in \"Handsome Is that Handsome Does\", a comedy by C. J. Ribton Turner at the Vaudeville Theatre. At the Olympic that year, he reprised the role Pierre in \"The Two Orphans\" and appeared in \"Hands Across the Sea\" by Henry Pettitt.\n\nIn 1890, Neville went to America with Augustus Harris's company, appearing for 200 nights as Captain Temple in \"Human Nature\", renamed \"The Soudan\" for its U.S. production. On his return to England he resumed his successful place in the autumn melodramas at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nThe last phase of Neville's career was with Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company at His Majesty's Theatre, where his roles included Leonato and, in \"Richard II\", John of Gaunt. His last engagement was in Tree's revival of \"The School for Scandal\" in 1909. By this stage in his career, Neville had moved to the role of Sir Oliver Surface, with Robert Loraine in Neville's old role as Sir Oliver's nephew, Charles. \"The Manchester Guardian\" found Neville \"admirably sonorous\" in the part. \"The Observer\" wrote: \"the weighty Sir Oliver of Mr Henry Neville, so well remembered as the dashing Charles Surface of thirty years ago, is exactly in tune with the quietly humorous Moses of Mr Lionel Brough\".\n\nNeville wrote six plays, all melodramas. He also published some short books on the theatre, entitled \"The Stage, its Past and Present, in Relation to Fine Art\"; \"Gesture; Her First Appearance\"; and \"His First and Last Benefit,\"\n\nNeville died at Seaford, Sussex, one day short of his 73rd birthday, of a heart attack induced by a minor accident and was buried at Christ Church in Denshaw, Saddleworth, Yorkshire. He left four sons, from his marriage to Harriet Jane Waddell (c. 1837–1903). \"The Times\" concluded its obituary notice of Neville: \"He had troops of friends, and there are not two opinions as to his reputation for fair dealing with his fellow men. As well as an actor, he was a man of business, with a fund of common sense, fond of sport, and a glutton for outdoor exercise. He was well known as a Freemason and generally respected by all with whom he was associated, and beloved by those who knew him intimately.\"\n\n"}

He is best known for \"Nemoe Karma\", a 1931 novel which is considered the first Balinese-language novel.\n\nLittle has been uncovered about Gobiah's life, despite efforts by several researchers. However, it is known that Gobiah was born in approximately 1898 to a poor family in Panjer village, Badung Regency, Bali (now part of southern Denpasar). Gobiah's father was a manservant to King Tjokorda at Denpasar Palace; the family received land on which to live from the palace in exchange for Gobiah's father's work.\n\nDuring the Dutch intervention in 1906, Gobiah was tasked to accompany Prince Ida Tjokardo Alit Ngurah to exile in nearby Lombok. By order of the prince, Gobiah was schooled until the third year in a local school. After finishing his time there, he was sent to Singaraja to continue his studies in 1910. In Singaraja, he studied to be a teacher under Mas Nitisastro; Nitisastro, who also worked as a writer, used Balinese-language short stories he had written to interest his students and introduce them to the world of literature. By 1912 Gobiah was reportedly working as a teacher in Denpasar, at the age of 14.\n\nWhile working as a teacher, Gobiah developed an interest in theatre, including traditional dance and singing. By 1919 he was working as the principal of an elementary school in Mengwi, Badung. While in Mengwi, he married Si Luh Rupek; together the couple had one child. However, not long after the birth of their child, Si Luh Rupek fell ill and died. She was followed by their child several years later.\n\nAlone again, Gobiah began reading heavily. Through his school and contacts with Mas Nitisastro, he subscribed to Balai Pustaka-published periodicals such as \"Pandji Poestaka\" and \"Seri Poestaka\". He also read novels, such as \"Sitti Nurbaya\" (1922), published by the state-owned publishing house. According to Balinese literary scholars I Gusti Ngurah Bagus and I Ketut Ginarsa, this reading influenced his literary work.\n\nBy 1922 Gobiah had begun rewriting traditional stories to be more accessible to his students; this was followed by translating works into Balinese. In 1923 he published an illustrated fable entitled \"Satua Lutung Mungil\" (\"A Favourite Monkey\"), written with Balinese script. This was published by Balai Pustaka. \"Satua Lutung Mungil\" was followed by a retelling of Rare Angon in \"geguritan\" form in 1926. Although Gobiah is known to have received money from Balai Pustaka for this work, it is unknown if it was ultimately published. Not long afterwards he remarried. \n\nGobiah's seminal work, \"Nemoe Karma\", was published by Balai Pustaka in 1931. The first Balinese language novel, it dealt with themes of forced marriage and love.\n\n"}

He then acted alongside Sean Penn and Adrien Brody in the war film \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998). After playing supporting roles in \"Black and White\" and \"Girl, Interrupted\", Leto portrayed Angel Face in \"Fight Club\" (1999), which has since became a cult film.\n\nIn 2000, Leto played Paul Allen in the psychological thriller \"American Psycho\". The same year, he starred as heroin addict Harry Goldfarb in \"Requiem for a Dream\", directed by Darren Aronofsky. His acting in the addiction drama received praise from film critics. During this period Leto focused increasingly on his band Thirty Seconds to Mars, returning to acting in 2002 in the David Fincher-directed thriller \"Panic Room\", which was well-received both critically and commercially. Following the lead role in the independent film, \"Highway\" (2002), he co-starred with Colin Farrell in the historical drama \"Alexander\" (2004) as Hephaestion. Leto then starred together with Nicolas Cage in the political crime thriller \"Lord of War\" (2005) and acted alongside Salma Hayek in the crime drama \"Lonely Hearts\" (2006) as Raymond Fernandez. He also began to direct music videos for Thirty Seconds to Mars, with the first being \"The Kill\" (2006). The following year, he portrayed Mark David Chapman in the biopic \"Chapter 27\". Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Leto's performance was widely praised.\n\nIn 2009, he starred in the science fiction drama \"Mr. Nobody\" directed by Jaco Van Dormael. Critics praised the film's artistry and Leto's acting. He later directed the music videos for \"Kings and Queens\" (2009) and \"Hurricane\" (2010), which were both nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction. The latter garnered controversy upon release and was initially censored due to its elements of violence. In 2012, Leto made his directorial debut with the documentary film \"Artifact\". After a six-year hiatus, he returned to film acting in the 2013 drama \"Dallas Buyers Club\" starring together with Matthew McConaughey, for which he received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and a variety of film critics' circle awards. Leto premiered the documentary series \"Into the Wild\" in 2014. He then played the Joker in the superhero film \"Suicide Squad\" (2016), which was unfavorably reviewed by critics, though Leto's performance received raves.\n"}

The Karen and Burmese army had fought at various times for over fifty years, but in the early 1990s the Burmese army launched a major operation to secure the route of an oil pipeline through the area. In March 1997, a local pastor brought the two illiterate nine-year-olds to the local military chief and said the Lord had spoken to them and they would save the Karen people. According to the legend among followers, the twins then rallied defenders of their village by shouting \"God's Army!\", leading them to a victory over Burmese troops. Various legends claimed that the brothers had numerous magical powers, including invulnerability to bullets and mines, and that they could hand out magical bullets. Supposedly, they could kill by pointing a rifle at the ground and concentrating. One tale claims that Johnny turned himself into an old man and back when bathing in a river. The legend of the boys was embraced by locals who viewed the existing Karen National Union as corrupt and ineffective. A new rebel group called God's Army of the Holy Mountain, or God's Army for short, was thus formed under the nominal leadership of the Htoo twins.\n\nGod's Army was situated in mountainous rainforests along the border between Burma and Thailand. They were a band of Christian guerrillas who maintained an austere lifestyle, including abstinence from sexual intercourse, alcohol, milk, eggs and pork. The boys, called \"Bu Lu\" and \"Bu Joh\" by their followers, were both chain smokers and were said to know the Bible by heart although they had never studied it.\nIn October 1999, a group calling themselves Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors seized the Burmese embassy in Bangkok and the situation ended with their departure, at which point they were taken in by God's Army.\n\nThe Htoos came to worldwide attention in January 2000 when 10 members of God's Army seized a hospital in Ratchaburi, Thailand. The group held 700 to 800 patients and staff members hostage for 22 hours. They demanded the Thai government stop shelling Karen positions in Burma and treatment for their wounded. Thai security forces stormed the hospital, killing all 10 of the gunmen. A photograph taken by Associated Press photographer Apichart Weerawong of a long-haired Johnny posing next to his tougher-looking, cigar-puffing brother was circulated around the world after the hospital raid. After the raid, God's Army were strenuously pursued by the Tatmadaw (Burmese armed forces) and shunned by other Karen rebels. Luther claimed at the time he had 250,000 invisible soldiers in his command while Johnny had 150,000 of his own. Their flesh-and-blood followers was estimated to be around 500 in 1998, but gradually declined to between 100 and 200 men by early 2000 after many left to find work to support their refugee families. Meanwhile, the Burmese army had 21,000 troops in the area.\n\nThe twins surrendered to Thai soldiers in January 2001 and requested sanctuary. By that time the number of their followers had dwindled to less than 20. They repudiated the stories about being invulnerable but insisted that God had helped them to survive over the years. They were reunited with their family. In July 2006, Johnny Htoo surrendered in Burma's military government with eight other members of God's Army in two groups.\n\nLuther Htoo now lives in Sweden. Johnny Htoo lives in a Thai refugee camp and has been attempting to go to New Zealand to join his mother and sister.\n\n"}

Among his siblings was the artist John Martin and the philosopher William Martin. Jonathan was tongue tied and spoke with an impediment. He was brought up by his aunt, Ann Thompson, a staunch Protestant with a vivid image of hell.\n\nAfter he witnessed the murder of his sister by a neighbour, he was sent to his uncle's farm to recover from the shock. He was apprenticed to a tanner but was press ganged in London in 1804. He served in the Royal Navy ship HMS \"Hercule\" for six years, including the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. He was noted among his shipmates for his religious obsession.\n\nHe left the Navy when his ship was broken up in 1810, returning to Norton, County Durham, where he married, and his son Richard was born in 1814. After his parents died, he became a Wesleyan preacher in 1814, strongly denouncing the Church of England. He gained a reputation for disrupting church services.\n\nAfter threatening to shoot the Bishop of Oxford, Edward Legge at a confirmation service in Stockton in 1817, he was arrested, tried, and was sent to a private lunatic asylum in West Auckland. He was later moved to the public asylum in Gateshead. He escaped in June 1820, but was soon recaptured.\n\nHis wife died of breast cancer in 1821, and he escaped from the asylum for a second time, returning to work as a tanner and preacher. The Wesleyan Church refused to take him back, and he was turned away by the Primitive Methodists. He published his autobiography at Lincoln in 1826, with further editions published in 1828, 1829 and 1830, and he made a living by selling his book.\n\nHe remarried in Boston, Lincolnshire in 1828, to Maria Hudson, and the couple moved to York.\n\nA year later, Martin had another mental breakdown. On Sunday 1 February 1829, he became upset by a buzzing sound in the organ while attending evensong at York Minster. He hid in the building, and then lit a lamp in the belltower. The cathedral watchman had been discharged, and the light was ignored by anyone who saw it. Later that night, he set fire to the woodwork in the choir before escaping through a window. Smoke was seen coming out of the building at 7am on 2 February, and the fire was raging through the organ and choir by 8am. The fire was brought under control that afternoon and extinguished on 3 February, when the extent of the damage became apparent. A section of the roof of the central aisle approximately long was destroyed, stretching from the lantern tower towards the east window, together with much of the internal woodwork from the organ screen to the altar screen, including the organ, medieval choir stalls, the bishop's throne, and the pulpit. The cause – arson – soon became apparent, and the culprit was identified from threatening placards Martin had left on the Minster railings in previous days, including his initials and address.\n\nMartin was captured near Hexham on 6 February. He was tried at York Castle in March 1829, before Baron Hullock and a jury. The case was a national cause célèbre, coming only two months after the trials of Burke and Hare in Edinburgh. Martin was defended by Henry Brougham, who had gained notoriety for defending Queen Caroline in 1821. Despite the jury ruling that he was guilty on a capital charge, which should have resulted in a death sentence, the judge declared him not guilty on the grounds of insanity. He was detained in Bethlem Royal Hospital, where he remained until he died 9 years later. During this period of detention, he made a number of drawings, including self-portraits and an apocalyptic picture of the destruction of London. His son, Richard, from his first marriage, was brought up by Jonathan's brother John. Richard committed suicide in September 1838, three months after his father's death.\n\nProfessor Herschel Prins has described Martin as \"probably the most well-known example of a manic depressive arsonist\".\n\n"}

{"id": "544455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=544455", "title": "Kenneth Copeland", "text": "Kenneth Copeland\n\nKenneth Max Copeland (born December 6, 1936) is an American author, musician, public speaker, and televangelist associated with the Charismatic Movement. Copeland has been identified with preaching a prosperity and abundance message, commonly referred to as the prosperity gospel, which has been criticized by various denominations. His Tarrant County, Texas-based Kenneth Copeland Ministries (KCM) advocates daily application of the \"Word of God\", meaning the Bible. KCM specializes in biblical teaching that focuses on faith, love, healing, prosperity and restoration through diverse media, such as television, internet, books, CD and DVD. KCM's motto is \"Jesus is Lord\" based upon Romans 10:9.\n\nKenneth Max Copeland was born in Lubbock, Texas, to Aubrey Wayne and Vinita Pearl (née Owens) Copeland. He was raised in West Texas near a United States Army Air Forces airfield, which inspired him to become a pilot.\n\nCopeland married Ivy Bodiford in October 1955 and were the parents of Terri Copeland Pearsons. They divorced in 1958. Kenneth married Gloria (née Neece) on April 13, 1963. They are the parents of John Copeland and Kellie Copeland Swisher. Gloria and the Copeland children work for KCM. Kellie preaches at various meetings throughout the United States, as does Terri, who also preaches at Eagle Mountain International Church, pastored by her husband, George Pearsons.\n\nPrior to his conversion to Christianity in November 1962, Copeland was a recording artist on the Imperial Records label, having one \"Billboard\" Top 40 hit (\"Pledge of Love\", which charted in the Top 40 on April 20, 1957, stayed on the charts for 15 weeks, and peaked at #17).\n\nFollowing his conversion, Copeland turned the rest of his life over to the gospel and ministry work. In the fall of 1967, he enrolled in Oral Roberts University, where he soon became the pilot and chauffeur for Oral Roberts.\n\nHistorically, Copeland's ministry held a number of conventions across the United States which lasted anywhere from three to six days. The number of longer set conventions has waned in recent years, although KCM still holds an annual Believer's Convention in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas, during the week of July 4. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, along with ministry friends including some family members, also preach at other conventions and conferences throughout the world. These events stream live on Copeland's website, kcm.org, as well as being shown on Christian television stations such as God TV and the Daystar Television Network. Portions of recorded conferences are shown Sundays. The Monday through Friday television broadcasts feature a Copeland family member, either alone or with another minister, discussing subjects from The Holy Bible.\nMost of these episodes are available on BVOV.tv. In July 2015, KCM launched the Believer's Voice of Victory Network on channel 265 of Dish TV.\n\n\nKenneth Copeland Ministries is located at 14355 Morris Dido Road, Fort Worth, TX 76192 on 33 acres (13 ha) and was valued at $554,160 in 2008 by Tarrant Appraisal District. The site includes the Eagle Mountain International Church, television production and audio recording facilities, warehouse and distribution facilities, residences for the Copeland family, and Kenneth Copeland Airport. Approximately 500 people are employed by KCM. John Copeland is the ministry's chief operating officer.\n\nKCM also owns a 1998 Cessna 550 Citation Bravo, which it received from a donor in October 2007 and is used for domestic flights, and a 2005 Cessna 750 Citation X, which it uses for international flights. It also is restoring a 1962 Beech H-18 Twin, which the ministry plans to use for disaster relief efforts.\n\nIn February 2007, Copeland was accused of using his ministry's Citation X for personal vacations and friends. The Copelands' financial records are not publicly available, and a list of the board of directors is not accessible as these details are protected but known confidentially by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Responding to media questions, Copeland pointed to what he asserted was an accounting firm's declaration that all jet travel complies with federal tax laws. In December 2008, KCM's Citation Bravo was denied tax exemption after KCM refused to submit a standardized Texas Comptroller form that some county appraisal districts use to make determinations, which would have required making public the salary of all ministry staff. KCM subsequently filed suit with the Tarrant Appraisal District in January 2009 and its petition to have the aircraft's tax-exempt status restored was granted in March 2010.\n\nKenneth Copeland Ministries has taken advantage of a Federal Aviation Administration program that keeps flights private from tracking websites, and the ministry owns five such aircraft whose flights are kept private, including the Cessna 750 Citation X note above and a North American T-28 Trojan. United States Senator Chuck Grassley has questioned some of the flights taken by these aircraft, including layovers in Maui, Fiji, and Honolulu. The ministries say that the stopovers were for preaching or for allowing pilot rest.\n\nAccording to the Washington Times, Kenneth Copeland (and another televangelist Jesse Duplantis), has defended his use of private jets as a luxury means of travel, arguing that commercial planes are full of \"a bunch of demons.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Christian Post\", Kenneth Copeland Ministries was criticized in 2010 for failing to fly disaster relief missions to Haiti after allegedly promising an aviation relief assistance program called Angel Flight 44. The Angel Flight 44 ministry was announced by Kenneth Copeland Ministries in 2006 and the ministry attempted to raise money to fund it. Richard Vermillion, co-author of a book on Angel Flight 44 commissioned by Kenneth Copeland Ministries, said that Copeland promised to form the aviation ministry but now believes it was never created. A spokesperson for Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Stephen Swisher, told \"The Christian Post\", \"This was not a specific promise with a time line attached\", and said that the money was spent on airplane repairs, and that the airplane was \"not in airworthy condition\" and had \"structural issues.\".\n\nIn late November 2007, Mike Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential primary candidate, made six appearances on Copeland's daily television program \"Believer's Voice of Victory\", discussing \"Integrity of Character.\" Huckabee, an ordained Baptist minister, was appearing on Copeland's daily broadcast to promote his book, \"Character IS the Issue: How People with Integrity Can Revolutionize America\". Through the years, Copeland has invited many church pastors and evangelists to appear on his daily program to discuss their respective books. Subsequently, in January 2008, the Huckabee campaign paid for use of Kenneth Copeland Ministries' facilities for a fundraiser. The fundraising at the church was criticized by the Trinity Foundation.\n\nAs a result of the Huckabee appearances, Kenneth Copeland Ministries was one of six approached by the United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations. The Copelands responded with a financial statement and created a website, \"Believers Stand United\", to help explain their perspective.\n\nIn 2013, a measles outbreak (20 confirmed cases as of August 26) in Tarrant County was attributed in the press to anti-vaccination sentiments expressed by members of the Copeland Ministries. The church denied making any such statements and urged members to get vaccinations, even offering free immunizations through the church itself. Pastor Terri Copeland Pearsons, who is Kenneth Copeland's daughter, offered free vaccination clinics and advised those who did not attend one of the clinics to quarantine themselves at home for two weeks. In a statement on the church website, Pearsons said she was not against immunizations, but also raised concerns about them.\n\n\"Some people think I am against immunizations, but that is not true,\" the statement said. \"Vaccinations help cut the mortality rate enormously. I believe it is wrong to be against vaccinations. The concerns we have had are primarily with very young children who have family history of autism and with bundling too many immunizations at one time. There is no indication of the autism connection with vaccinations in older children. Furthermore, the new MMR vaccination is without thimerosal (mercury), which has also been a concern to many.\"\n\nKenneth Copeland and his wife, Gloria Copeland, were featured in a 2015 episode of \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" that gained media attention. Comedian John Oliver criticized the Copelands for using tax laws to live in a $6.3 million mansion as the parsonage allowance for their home is not subject to income taxes, for using church donations to buy a $20 million jet that was used for trips to a ski resort and a private game ranch, and for promotion of healing through faith and skepticism of medicine, which Oliver highlighted with a video of Gloria Copeland saying that doctors give patients \"poison that will make you sicker\" and that the church is an alternative to medical treatment: \"Which do you want to do? Do you want to do that,\" Copeland asked of the doctor's \"poison\" treatment, \"or do you want to sit here on a Saturday morning, hear the word of God, and let faith come into your heart and be healed?\"\n\nIn 2009, Copeland's $3.6 million jet was denied tax-exempt status, opening up a possible investigation into the church's expenses; Copeland failed to disclose the salaries of his directors. In 2008 the ministry stated it owned five airplanes, one of which is valued at $17.5 million.\n\nCopeland's ministry bought a multi-million Gulfstream V jet airplane and Copeland thanked his followers and Jesus for buying it when it was delivered at the Fort Worth airstrip, wearing a pilot jacket and sunglasses. The jet was bought from filmmaker and businessman Tyler Perry. Copeland had earlier stated that flying commercial was like entering \"a long tube with a bunch of demons\", and defended the use of private jets as it was important, it lets for prayer in privacy 'as the Lord leads' and avoids unnecessary demons. Now, the church is asking another $17 or $19.5 million for the building of a hangar, upgrading the runway and maintenance.\n\nCopeland's and other televangelists' use of private jets and other lavish houses and vehicles has been criticized.\n\n\n\n"}

She attended the School of the Holy Spirit of Quezon City during her elementary and high school years and went for her collegiate studies at the University of Santo Tomas where she obtained her degree in physical therapy. She is also a licensed Physical Therapist for the state of Indiana in the United States. Before her Binibining Pilipinas stint, Quiambao had a thriving career as a therapist for St. Luke's Hospital in Manila. Also, she worked as an instructor for a local gym.\n\nIn 1999, Quiambao joined the Binibining Pilipinas pageant. She received several awards, including Miss Photogenic, and captured the Binibining Pilipinas World 1999 title. However, controversy soon erupted when the Binibining Pilipinas Universe titleholder \"Janelle Bautista\" was dethroned due to questionable citizenship. She was then asked to take over the title and be the Philippine representative to the Miss Universe 1999 pageant to be held that year in Trinidad and Tobago. Binibining Pilipinas International 1999, \"Lalaine Edson\" took over Quiambao's previous title.\n\nBefore arriving at the host country, Quiambao trained in Venezuela under the guidance of Osmel Sousa for a week.\n\nShe was one of the strongest and most visible contenders for the crown. She consistently placed second during the pageant's preliminaries and bested a composite score of 9.52, just trailing behind the score of Sonia Raciti, the South African candidate. At the semifinals, she once again placed second overall in the swimsuit and evening gown competitions, racking up scores as high as 9.32 and 9.42 respectively. It was Spain's candidate, Diana Nogueira that dominated the semifinals with a marginal lead over Quiambao of 9.33 for the swimsuit event and 9.45 for the evening gown competition.\n\nDuring the preliminary round of the evening gown competition, Quiambao slipped and fell on stage. As she walked, the heel of one of her shoes got caught in the trail of her evening gown and she slipped on the floor. Despite this incident she collected herself, regained composure, walked graciously, finished her walk, and drew applause from the audience. At the finals, Quiambao referred to the incident during an interview portion. She said \"she felt she represented those women who have fallen both on and off the stage\" and hopes to be \"an example to the rest of the women in the world\".\n\nEarly at the competition she received the Clairol Herbal Essences Style Award, the only Asian candidate at the pageant to do so. She was called as one of the final three delegates, alongside Misses Botswana and Spain. Quiambao faltered during the final question, which tackled the debate of whether a Miss Universe should continue her reign even if she gets pregnant. Spain's Diana Nogueira placed as 2nd Runner-Up. It all came down to Philippines' Quiambao and Botswana's Mpule Kwelagobe, and in the end, Quiambao placed as 1st Runner-up, with Mpule Kwelagobe of Botswana win the Miss Universe 1999 title.\n\nAfter her triumphant stint at the pageant, Quiambao began a new career working as a TV Host/Correspondent for GMA Network back in the Philippines. In December 1999, she co-hosted Unang Hirit\" with Arnold Clavio, Lyn Ching-Pascual, Suzi Entrata-Abrera, Mickey Ferriols and Ryan Agoncillo. Quiambao hosted a lifestyle segment of the show called \"Istayl\".\n\nQuiambao then joined Paolo Bediones on hosting the show \"Extra, Extra\", which eventually evolved into a reality program called \"Extra Challenge\". Upon leaving the show in December 2003, a nationwide search was made for her replacement. She briefly hosted \"All About You\", a show about women and good values, and fulfilled her dream of having her own talk show.\n\nIn January 2004, she got married to Italian businessman Claudio Rondinelli but the two-year marriage eventually fell apart and Quiambao went back to the Philippines in 2006. She resumed her TV hosting career, working alongside again with Paolo Bediones, this time presenting a travel show, \"Pinoy Meets World\".\n\nShe also co-host for the show \"Palaban\" on GMA 7 with Winnie Monsod and Malou Mangahas tackling current events, socio-economic and political issues in the Philippines in 2007. Also, she became the host for QTV 11's \"Dahil Sa Iyong Paglisan\", a made for TV show highlighting the experiences, trials and success of Overseas Filipino Workers or OFW.\n\nDuring the first anniversary of \"100% Pinoy\", she was one of the new host together with Joaquin Valdez. She was also the co-host for \"The Beat\" (formerly Sapulso) on QTV with journalist/newscaster Ivan Mayrina.\n\nOn the second half of the year 2009, she went on to test her acting skills by appearing in a Philippine horror movie Patient X as the Nurse Betty and the comedy movie Kimmy Dora as Gertrude. Once again, she appeared on television through the TV series \"Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo\" as Aludra, the guest villain for the series.\n\nIn 2011, she played Josie/Alonah in the Fantasy series Bangis on TV5. She played as \"Maxene\" in notable sitcom \"The Jose and Wally Show Starring Vic Sotto\" on the said network. In that same year, she had a cameo role as Ryan Agoncillo's boss for the movie \"House Husband: Ikaw Na!\".\n\nQuiambao was criticized by the LGBT community in the Philippines in early 2012 over remarks she made about homosexuality while being a guest on the current affairs talk show \"The Bottomline with Boy Abunda\". It was followed by her taking her stand to a Twitter post, saying: \"Homosexuality is not a sin but it is a lie from the devil.\" Her words have caused a huge backlash with openly gay Filipino celebrities and the rest of the entertainment industry criticizing her for such a \"closed-minded\" statement. She has since apologized for \"not being sensitive\" with her choice of words on a Twitter post.\n\n\nQuiambao was previously married to Italian businessman Claudio Rondinelli in 2004 and lived with him in Hong Kong.

{"id": "140389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140389", "title": "Mitanni", "text": "Mitanni\n\nMitanni (; Hittite cuneiform\n\nAt the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite Empire, Mitanni and Egypt struck an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, Mitanni had outposts centred on its capital, Washukanni, whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the headwaters of the Khabur River. The Mitanni dynasty ruled over the northern Euphrates-Tigris region between c. 1475 and c. 1275 BC. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks and was reduced to the status of a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire.\n\nWhile the Mitanni kings were Indo-Aryan, they used the language of the local people, which was at that time a non-Indo-European language, Hurrian. Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the Levant of a distinct pottery type.\n\nThe Mitanni controlled trade routes down the Khabur to Mari and up the Euphrates from there to Carchemish. For a time they also controlled the Assyrian territories of the upper Tigris and its headwaters at Nineveh, Erbil, Assur and Nuzi. Their allies included Kizuwatna in southeastern Anatolia, Mukish which stretched between Ugarit and Quatna west of the Orontes to the sea, and the Niya which controlled the east bank of the Orontes from Alalah down through Aleppo, Ebla and Hama to Qatna and Kadesh. To the east, they had good relations with the Kassites. The land of Mitanni in northern Syria extended from the Taurus mountains to its west and as far east as Nuzi (modern Kirkuk) and the river Tigris in the east. In the south, it extended from Aleppo across (\"Nuhashshe\") to Mari on the Euphrates in the east. Its centre was in the Khabur River valley, with two capitals: Taite and Washshukanni called \"Taidu\" and \"Ushshukana\" respectively in Assyrian sources. The whole area supports agriculture without artificial irrigation and cattle, sheep and goats were raised. It is very similar to Assyria in climate, and was settled by both indigenous Hurrian and Amoritic-speaking (\"Amurru\") populations.\n\nThe Mitanni kingdom was referred to as the Maryannu, Nahrin or Mitanni by the Egyptians, the Hurri by the Hittites, and the Hanigalbat by the Assyrians. The different names seem to have referred to the same kingdom and were used interchangeably, according to Michael C. Astour. Hittite annals mention a people called \"Hurri\" (\"\"), located in northeastern Syria. A Hittite fragment, probably from the time of Mursili I, mentions a \"King of the Hurri\". The Assyro-Akkadian version of the text renders \"Hurri\" as \"Hanigalbat\". Tushratta, who styles himself \"king of Mitanni\" in his Akkadian Amarna letters, refers to his kingdom as Hanigalbat.\n\nEgyptian sources call Mitanni \"nhrn\", which is usually pronounced as \"Naharin/Naharina\" from the Assyro-Akkadian word for \"river\", cf. \"Aram-Naharaim\". The name \"Mitanni\" is first found in the \"memoirs\" of the Syrian wars (c. 1480 BC) of the official astronomer and clockmaker Amenemhet, who returned from the \"foreign country called \"Me-ta-ni\"\" at the time of Thutmose I. The expedition to the Naharina announced by Thutmosis I at the beginning of his reign may have actually taken place during the long previous reign of Amenhotep I. Helck believes that this was the expedition mentioned by Amenhotep II.\n\nThe ethnicity of the people of Mitanni is difficult to ascertain. A treatise on the training of chariot horses by Kikkuli contains a number of Indo-Aryan glosses. Kammenhuber (1968) suggested that this vocabulary was derived from the still undivided Indo-Iranian language, but Mayrhofer (1974) has shown that specifically Indo-Aryan features are present.\n\nThe names of the Mitanni aristocracy frequently are of Indo-Aryan origin, but it is specifically their deities which show Indo-Aryan roots (Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatya), though some think that they are more immediately related to the Kassites. The common people's language, the Hurrian language, is neither Indo-European nor Semitic. Hurrian is related to Urartian, the language of Urartu, both belonging to the Hurro-Urartian language family. It had been held that nothing more can be deduced from current evidence. A Hurrian passage in the Amarna letters – usually composed in Akkadian, the \"lingua franca\" of the day – indicates that the royal family of Mitanni was by then speaking Hurrian as well.\n\nBearers of names in the Hurrian language are attested in wide areas of Syria and the northern Levant that are clearly outside the area of the political entity known to Assyria as \"Hanilgalbat\". There is no indication that these persons owed allegiance to the political entity of Mitanni; although the German term \"Auslandshurriter\" (\"Hurrian expatriates\") has been used by some authors. In the 14th century BC numerous city-states in northern Syria and Canaan were ruled by persons with Hurrian and some Indo-Aryan names. If this can be taken to mean that the population of these states was Hurrian as well, then it is possible that these entities were a part of a larger polity with a shared Hurrian identity. This is often assumed, but without a critical examination of the sources. Differences in dialect and regionally different pantheons (\"Hepat/Shawushka, Sharruma/Tilla\" etc.) point to the existence of several groups of Hurrian speakers.\n\nNo native sources for the history of Mitanni have been found so far. The account is mainly based on Assyrian, Hittite, and Egyptian sources, as well as inscriptions from nearby places in Syria. Often it is not even possible to establish synchronicity between the rulers of different countries and cities, let alone give uncontested absolute dates. The definition and history of Mitanni is further beset by a lack of differentiation between linguistic, ethnic and political groups.\n\nIt is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of Babylon due to its sacking by Hittite king Mursili I, and the Kassite invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo (Yamhad), the weak middle Assyrian kings who succeeded Puzur-Ashur III, and the internal strife of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper Mesopotamia. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni.\n\nKing Barattarna of Mitanni expanded the kingdom west to Halab (Aleppo) and made the Canaanite king Idrimi of Alalakh his vassal. The state of Kizzuwatna in the west also shifted its allegiance to Mitanni, and Assyria in the east had become largely a Mitannian vassal state by the mid-15th century BC. The nation grew stronger during the reign of Shaushtatar but the Hurrians were keen to keep the Hittites inside the Anatolian highland. Kizzuwatna in the west and Ishuwa in the north were important allies against the hostile Hittites.\n\nAfter a few successful clashes with the Pharaohs over the control of Syria, Mitanni sought peace with Egypt and an alliance was formed. During the reign of Shuttarna in the early 14th century BC the relationship was very amicable, and he sent his daughter Gilu-Hepa to Egypt for a marriage with Pharaoh Amenhotep III. Mitanni was now at its peak of power.\nHowever, by the reign of Eriba-Adad I (1390–1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between Tushratta and his brother Artatama II and after this his son Shuttarna II, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.\nKing Ashur-Uballit I (1365–1330 BC) of Assyria attacked Shuttarna and annexed Mittani territory in the middle of the 14th century BC, making Assyria once more a great power.\n\nAt the death of Shuttarna, Mitanni was ravaged by a war of succession. Eventually Tushratta, a son of Shuttarna, ascended the throne, but the kingdom had been weakened considerably and both the Hittite and Assyrian threats increased. At the same time, the diplomatic relationship with Egypt went cold, the Egyptians fearing the growing power of the Hittites and Assyrians. The Hittite king Suppiluliuma I invaded the Mitanni vassal states in northern Syria and replaced them with loyal subjects.\n\nIn the capital Washukanni, a new power struggle broke out. The Hittites and the Assyrians supported different pretenders to the throne. Finally a Hittite army conquered the capital Washukanni and installed Shattiwaza, the son of Tushratta, as their vassal king of Mitanni in the late 14th century BC. The kingdom had by now been reduced to the Khabur Valley. The Assyrians had not given up their claim on Mitanni, and in the 13th century BC, Shalmaneser I annexed the kingdom.\n\nAs early as Akkadian times, Hurrians are known to have lived east of the river Tigris on the northern rim of Mesopotamia, and in the Khabur Valley. The group which became Mitanni gradually moved south into Mesopotamia before the 17th century BC.\n\nHurrians are mentioned in the private Nuzi texts, in Ugarit, and the Hittite archives in Hattushsha (Boğazköy). Cuneiform texts from Mari mention rulers of city-states in upper Mesopotamia with both \"Amurru\" (Amorite) and Hurrian names. Rulers with Hurrian names are also attested for Urshum and Hashshum, and tablets from Alalakh (layer VII, from the later part of the old-Babylonian period) mention people with Hurrian names at the mouth of the Orontes. There is no evidence for any invasion from the North-east. Generally, these onomastic sources have been taken as evidence for a Hurrian expansion to the South and the West.\n\nA Hittite fragment, probably from the time of Mursili I, mentions a \"King of the Hurrians\" (\"LUGAL ERÍN.MEŠ Hurri\"). This terminology was last used for King Tushratta of Mitanni, in a letter in the Amarna archives. The normal title of the king was 'King of the Hurri-men' (without the determinative \"KUR\" indicating a country).\n\nIt is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of Babylon due to the Hittite sack by Mursili I and the Kassite invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo (Yamkhad), the weak middle Assyrian kings, and the internal strifes of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper Mesopotamia. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni. The legendary founder of the Mitannian dynasty was a king called Kirta, who was followed by a king Shuttarna. Nothing is known about these early kings.\n\nKing Barattarna is known from a cuneiform tablet in Nuzi and an inscription by Idrimi of Alalakh. Egyptian sources do not mention his name; that he was the king of Naharin whom Thutmose III fought against in the 15th century BC can only be deduced from assumptions. Whether Parsha(ta)tar, known from another Nuzi inscription, is the same as Barattarna, or a different king, is debated.\n\nUnder the rule of Thutmose III, Egyptian troops crossed the Euphrates and entered the core lands of Mitanni. At Megiddo, he fought an alliance of 330 Mitanni princes and tribal leaders under the ruler of Kadesh. See Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC). Mitanni had sent troops as well. Whether this was done because of existing treaties, or only in reaction to a common threat, remains open to debate. The Egyptian victory opened the way north.\n\nThutmose III again waged war in Mitanni in the 33rd year of his rule. The Egyptian army crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish and reached a town called Iryn (maybe present day Erin, 20 km northwest of Aleppo.) They sailed down the Euphrates to Emar (Meskene) and then returned home via Mitanni. A hunt for elephants at Lake Nija was important enough to be included in the annals. This was impressive PR, but did not lead to any permanent rule. Only the area at the middle Orontes and Phoenicia became part of Egyptian territory.\n\nVictories over Mitanni are recorded from the Egyptian campaigns in \"Nuhashshe\" (middle part of Syria). Again, this did not lead to permanent territorial gains. Barattarna or his son Shaushtatar controlled the North Mitanni interior up to \"Nuhashshe\", and the coastal territories from Kizzuwatna to Alalakh in the kingdom of Mukish at the mouth of the Orontes. Idrimi of Alalakh, returning from Egyptian exile, could only ascend his throne with Barattarna's consent. While he got to rule Mukish and Ama'u, Aleppo remained with Mitanni.\n\nShaushtatar, king of Mitanni, sacked the Assyrian capital of Assur some time in the 15th century during the reign of Nur-ili, and took the silver and golden doors of the royal palace to Washshukanni. This is known from a later Hittite document, the Suppililiuma-Shattiwaza treaty. After the sack of Assur, Assyria may have paid tribute to Mitanni up to the time of Eriba-Adad I (1390–1366 BC). There is no trace of that in the Assyrian king lists; therefore it is probable that Ashur was ruled by a native Assyrian dynasty owing sporadic allegiance to the house of Shaushtatar. While a sometime vassal of Mitanni, the temple of Sin and Shamash was built in Ashur.\n\nThe states of Aleppo in the west, and Nuzi and Arrapha in the east, seem to have been incorporated into Mitanni under Shaushtatar as well. The palace of the crown prince, the governor of Arrapha has been excavated. A letter from Shaushtatar was discovered in the house of Shilwe-Teshup. His seal shows heroes and winged geniuses fighting lions and other animals, as well as a winged sun. This style, with a multitude of figures distributed over the whole of the available space, is taken as typically Hurrian. A second seal, belonging to Shuttarna I, but used by Shaushtatar, found in Alalakh, shows a more traditional Assyro-Akkadian style.\n\nThe military superiority of Mitanni was probably based on the use of two-wheeled war-chariots, driven by the 'Marjannu' people. A text on the training of war-horses, written by a certain \"Kikkuli the Mitannian\" has been found in the archives recovered at Hattusa. More speculative is the attribution of the introduction of the chariot in Mesopotamia to early Mitanni.\n\nDuring the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep II, Mitanni seems to have regained influence in the middle Orontes valley that had been conquered by Thutmose III. Amenhotep fought in Syria in 1425 BC, presumably against Mitanni as well, but did not reach the Euphrates.\n\nLater on, Egypt and Mitanni became allies, and King Shuttarna II himself was received at the Egyptian court. Amicable letters, sumptuous gifts, and letters asking for sumptuous gifts were exchanged. Mitanni was especially interested in Egyptian gold. This culminated in a number of royal marriages: the daughter of King Artatama I was married to Thutmose IV. Kilu-Hepa, or Gilukhipa, the daughter of Shuttarna II, was married to Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled in the early 14th century BC. In a later royal marriage Tadu-Hepa, or Tadukhipa, the daughter of Tushratta, was sent to Egypt.\n\nWhen Amenhotep III fell ill, the king of Mitanni sent him a statue of the goddess Shaushka (Ishtar) of Nineveh that was reputed to cure diseases. A more or less permanent border between Egypt and Mitanni seems to have existed near Qatna on the Orontes River; Ugarit was part of Egyptian territory.\n\nThe reason Mitanni sought peace with Egypt may have been trouble with the Hittites. A Hittite king called Tudhaliya conducted campaigns against Kizzuwatna, Arzawa, Ishuwa, Aleppo, and maybe against Mitanni itself. Kizzuwatna may have fallen to the Hittites at that time.\n\nArtashumara followed his father Shuttarna II on the throne, but was murdered by a certain UD-hi, or Uthi. It is uncertain what intrigues that followed, but UD-hi then placed Tushratta, another son of Shuttarna, on the throne. Probably, he was quite young at the time and was intended to serve as a figurehead only. However, he managed to dispose of the murderer, possibly with the help of his Egyptian father-in-law, but this is sheer speculation.\n\nThe Egyptians may have suspected the mighty days of Mitanni were about to end. In order to protect their Syrian border zone the new Pharaoh Akhenaten instead received envoys from the resurgent powers of the Hittites and Assyria. From the Amarna letters we know how Tushratta's desperate claim for a gold statue from Akhenaten developed into a major diplomatic crisis.\n\nThe unrest weakened the Mitannian control of their vassal states, and Aziru of Amurru seized the opportunity and made a secret deal with the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I. Kizzuwatna, which had seceded from the Hittites, was reconquered by Suppiluliuma. In what has been called his first Syrian campaign, Suppiluliuma then invaded the western Euphrates valley, and conquered the \"Amurru\" and \"Nuhashshe\" in Mitanni.\n\nAccording to the later Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, Suppiluliuma had made a treaty with Artatama II, a rival of Tushratta. Nothing is known of this Artatama's previous life or connection, if any, to the royal family. He is called \"king of the Hurri\", while Tushratta went by the title \"King of Mitanni\". This must have disagreed with Tushratta. Suppiluliuma began to plunder the lands on the west bank of the Euphrates, and annexed Mount Lebanon. Tushratta threatened to raid beyond the Euphrates if even a single lamb or kid was stolen.\nBy the reign of Eriba-Adad I (1390–1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between Tushratta and his brother Artatama II and after this his son Shuttarna III, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs\n\nSuppiluliuma then recounts how the land of Ishuwa on the upper Euphrates had seceded in the time of his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it had failed. In the time of his father, other cities had rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have defeated them, but the survivors had fled to the territory of Ishuwa, that must have been part of Mitanni. A clause to return fugitives is part of many treaties between sovereign states and between rulers and vassal states, so perhaps the harbouring of fugitives by Ishuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion.\n\nA Hittite army crossed the border, entered Ishuwa and returned the fugitives (or deserters or exile governments) to Hittite rule. \"I freed the lands that I captured; they dwelt in their places. All the people whom I released rejoined their peoples, and Hatti incorporated their territories.\"\n\nThe Hittite army then marched through various districts towards Washukanni. Suppiluliuma claims to have plundered the area, and to have brought loot, captives, cattle, sheep and horses back to Hatti. He also claims that Tushratta fled, though obviously he failed to capture the capital. While the campaign weakened Mitanni, it did not endanger its existence.\n\nIn a second campaign, the Hittites again crossed the Euphrates and subdued Halab, Mukish, Niya, Arahati, Apina, and Qatna, as well as some cities whose names have not been preserved. The booty from Arahati included charioteers, who were brought to Hatti together with all their possessions. While it was common practice to incorporate enemy soldiers in the army, this might point to a Hittite attempt to counter the most potent weapon of Mitanni, the war-chariots, by building up or strengthening their own chariot forces.\n\nAll in all, Suppiluliuma claims to have conquered the lands \"from Mount Lebanon and from the far bank of the Euphrates\". But Hittite governors or vassal rulers are mentioned only for some cities and kingdoms. While the Hittites made some territorial gains in western Syria, it seems unlikely that they established a permanent rule east of the Euphrates.\n\nA son of Tushratta conspired with his subjects, and killed his father in order to become king. His brother Shattiwaza was forced to flee. In the unrest that followed, the Assyrians asserted themselves under Ashur-uballit I, and he invaded the country; and the pretender Artatama/Atratama II gained ascendancy, followed by his son Shuttarna. Suppiluliuma claims that \"the entire land of Mittanni went to ruin, and the land of Assyria and the land of Alshi divided it between them\", but this sounds more like wishful thinking. Although Assyria annexed Mitanni territory, the kingdom survived. Shuttarna wisely maintained good relations with Assyria, and returned to it the palace doors of Ashur, that had been taken by Shaushtatar. Such booty formed a powerful political symbol in ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nThe fugitive Shattiwaza may have gone to Babylon first, but eventually ended up at the court of the Hittite king, who married him to one of his daughters. The treaty between Suppiluliuma of Hatti and Shattiwaza of Mitanni has been preserved and is one of the main sources on this period. After the conclusion of the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, Piyashshili, a son of Suppiluliuma, led a Hittite army into Mitanni. According to Hittite sources, Piyashshili and Shattiwaza crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish, then marched against Irridu in Hurrian territory. They sent messengers from the west bank of the Euphrates and seemed to have expected a friendly welcome, but the people were loyal to their new ruler, influenced, as Suppiluliuma claims, by the riches of Tushratta. \"Why are you coming? If you are coming for battle, come, but you shall not return to the land of the Great King!\" they taunted. Shuttarna had sent men to strengthen the troops and chariots of the district of Irridu, but the Hittite army won the battle, and the people of Irridu sued for peace.\n\nMeanwhile, an Assyrian army \"led by a single charioteer\" marched on the capital Washshukanni. It seems that Shuttarna had sought Assyrian aid in the face of the Hittite threat. Possibly the force sent did not meet his expectations, or he changed his mind. In any case, the Assyrian army was refused entrance, and set instead to besiege the capital. This seems to have turned the mood against Shuttarna; perhaps the majority of the inhabitants of Washshukanni decided they were better off with the Hittite Empire than with their former subjects. In any case, a messenger was sent to Piyashshili and Shattiwaza at Irridu, who delivered his message in public, at the city gate. Piyashshili and Shattiwaza marched on Washukanni, and the cities of Harran and Pakarripa seem to have surrendered to them.\n\nWhile at Pakarripa, a desolate country where the troops suffered hunger, they received word of an Assyrian advance, but the enemy never materialised. The allies pursued the retreating Assyrian troops to Nilap_ini but could not force a confrontation. The Assyrians seem to have retreated home in the face of the superior force of the Hittites.\n\nShattiwaza became king of Mitanni, but after Suppililiuma had taken Carchemish and the land west of the Euphrates, that were governed by his son Piyashshili, Mitanni was restricted to the Khabur River and Balikh River valleys, and became more and more dependent on their allies in Hattarsus. Some scholars speak of a Hittite puppet kingdom, a buffer-state against the powerful Assyria.\n\nAssyria under Ashur-uballit I began to infringe on Mitanni as well. Its vassal state of Nuzi east of the Tigris was conquered and destroyed. According to the Hittitologist Trevor R. Bryce, Mitanni (or Hanigalbat as it was known) was permanently lost to Assyria during the reign of Mursili III of the Hittites, who was defeated by the Assyrians in the process. Its loss was a major blow to Hittite prestige in the ancient world and undermined the young king's authority over his kingdom.\n\nThe royal inscriptions of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari I (c. 1307–1275 BC) relate how the vassal king Shattuara of Mitanni rebelled and committed hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara was related to the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars think that he was the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza's one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. This must have happened during the reign of the Hittite King Mursili II, but there is no exact date.\n\nDespite Assyrian strength, Shattuara's son Wasashatta attempted to rebel. He sought Hittite help, but that kingdom was preoccupied with internal struggles, possibly connected with the usurpation of Hattusili III, who had driven his nephew Urhi-Teshup into exile. The Hittites took Wasashatta's money but did not help, as Adad-nirari's inscriptions gleefully note.\n\nThe Assyrians expanded further, and conquered the royal city of Taidu, and took Washshukannu, Amasakku, Kahat, Shuru, Nabula, Hurra and Shuduhu as well. They conquered Irridu, destroyed it utterly and sowed salt over it.\nThe wife, sons and daughters of Wasashatta were taken to Ashur, together with much booty and other prisoners. As Wasashatta himself is not mentioned, he must have escaped capture. There are letters of Wasashatta in the Hittite archives. Some scholars think he became ruler of a reduced Mitanni state called Shubria.\n\nWhile Adad-nirari I conquered the Mitanni heartland between the Balikh and the Khabur from the Hittites, he does not seem to have crossed the Euphrates, and Carchemish remained part of the Hittite kingdom. With his victory over Mitanni, Adad-nirari claimed the title of Great King (\"sharru rabû\") in letters to the Hittite rulers.\n\nIn the reign of Shalmaneser I (1270s–1240s) King Shattuara of Mitanni, a son or nephew of Wasahatta, rebelled against the Assyrian yoke with the help of the Hittites and the nomadic Ahlamu (Arameans) around 1250 BC. His army was well prepared; they had occupied all the mountain passes and waterholes, so that the Assyrian army suffered from thirst during their advance.\n\nNevertheless, Shalmaneser I won a crushing victory for Assyria over the Hittites and Mitanni. He claims to have slain 14,400 men; the rest were blinded and carried away. His inscriptions mention the conquest of nine fortified temples; 180 Hurrian cities were \"turned into rubble mounds\", and Shalmaneser \"…slaughtered like sheep the armies of the Hittites and the Ahlamu his allies…\". The cities from Taidu to Irridu were captured, as well as all of mount Kashiar to Eluhat and the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates. Another inscription mentions the construction of a temple to the Assyrian god Adad/Hadad in Kahat, a city of Mitanni that must have been occupied as well.\n\nA part of the population was deported and served as cheap labour. Administrative documents mention barley allotted to \"uprooted men\", deportees from Mitanni. For example, the Assyrian governor of the city Nahur, Meli-Sah received barley to be distributed to deported persons from Shuduhu \"as seed, food for their oxen and for themselves\".\nThe Assyrians built a line of frontier fortifications against the Hittites on the Balikh River.\n\nMitanni was now ruled by the Assyrian grand-vizier Ilī-padâ, a member of the royal family, who took the title of king (\"sharru\") of Hanigalbat. He resided in the newly built Assyrian administrative centre at Tell Sabi Abyad, governed by the Assyrian steward Tammitte. Assyrians maintained not only military and political control, but seem to have dominated trade as well, as no Hurrian or Mitanni names appear in private records of Shalmaneser's time.\n\nUnder the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1243–1207 BC) there were again numerous deportations from Hanigalbat (east Mitanni) to Ashur, probably in connection with the construction of a new palace. As the royal inscriptions mention an invasion of Hanigalbat by a Hittite king, there may have been a new rebellion, or at least native support of a Hittite invasion. The Mitanni towns may have been sacked at this time, as destruction levels have been found in some excavations that cannot be dated with precision, however. Tell Sabi Abyad, seat of the Assyrian government in Mitanni in the times of Shalmaneser, was deserted between 1200 and 1150 BC.\n\nIn the time of Ashur-nirari III (c. 1200 BC, the beginning Bronze Age collapse), the Phrygians and others invaded and destroyed the Hittite Empire, already weakened by defeats against Assyria. Some parts of Assyrian-ruled Hanigalbat was temporarily lost to the Phrygians also; however, the Assyrians defeated the Phrygians and regained these colonies. The Hurrians still held Katmuhu and Paphu. In the transitional period to the Early Iron Age, Mitanni was settled by invading Aramaeans.\n\nSome theonyms, proper names and other terminology of the Mitanni exhibit close similarities to Indo-Aryan, suggesting that an Indo-Aryan elite imposed itself over the Hurrian population in the course of the Indo-Aryan expansion. In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni, the deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya (Ashvins) are invoked. Kikkuli's horse training text includes technical terms such as \"aika\" (\"eka\", one), \"tera\" (\"tri\", three), \"panza\" (\"pancha\", five), \"satta\" (\"sapta\", seven), \"na\" (\"nava\", nine), \"vartana\" (\"vartana\", turn, round in the horse race). The numeral aika \"one\" is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has \"aiva\") in general.\n\nAnother text has \"babru\" (\"babhru\", brown), \"parita\" (\"palita\", grey), and \"pinkara\" (\"pingala\", red). Their chief festival was the celebration of the solstice (\"vishuva\") which was common in most cultures in the ancient world. The Mitanni warriors were called \"marya\", the term for warrior in Sanskrit as well; note mišta-nnu (= miẓḍha,~ Sanskrit mīḍha) \"payment (for catching a fugitive)\".\n\nSanskritic interpretations of Mitanni royal names render Artashumara (artaššumara) as Arta-smara \"who thinks of Arta/Ṛta\", Biridashva (biridašṷa, biriiašṷa) as Prītāśva \"whose horse is dear\", Priyamazda (priiamazda) as Priyamedha \"whose wisdom is dear\", Citrarata as citraratha \"whose chariot is shining\", Indaruda/Endaruta as Indrota \"helped by Indra\", Shativaza (šattiṷaza) as Sātivāja \"winning the race price\", Šubandhu as Subandhu \"having good relatives\", Tushratta (tṷišeratta, tušratta, etc.) as *tṷaiašaratha, Vedic Tvastr \"whose chariot is vehement\".\n\nAll dates must be taken with caution since they are worked out only by comparison with the chronology of other ancient Near Eastern nations.\n\nWithin a few centuries of the fall of Washshukanni to Assyria, Mitanni became fully Assyrianized and linguistically Aramaized, and use of the Hurrian language began to be discouraged throughout the Neo-Assyrian Empire. However, Urartean, a dialect closely related to Hurrian seems to have survived in the new state of Urartu, in the mountainous areas to the north in their Armenian Highlands. \nIn the 10th to 9th century BC inscriptions of Adad-nirari II and Shalmaneser III, \"Hanigalbat\" is still used as a geographical term.\n\n\n\n"}

She is a biology graduate student, investigating the BRCA1 breast cancer gene.\n\nSeif grew up in a family of activists, and politics was a constant topic of discussion during her childhood. Her father, Ahmed Seif, who died in 2014, was a human rights attorney and opposition leader who spent five years in prison during the Mubarak regime. During his detention, he was tortured. Her mother, Laila Soueif, is also an activist and a mathematics professor. She helped organize demonstrations against the Mubarak regime over the decades before his downfall. Her mother is \"known on the streets as brash and courageous, and has on numerous occasions faced down baton-wielding policemen with nothing but her scolding, scathing, booming voice and steely eyes\".\n\nSeif's brother Alaa Abd El-Fattah co-created the Egyptian blog aggregator \"Manalaa\" and in 2005 began to document abuses by the Mubarak regime. Alaa was arrested at a demonstration in 2006 and imprisoned for 45 days, during which Mona and his wife Manal helped organize an online campaign to free him. Seif's younger sister, Sanaa Seif, has also been an opposition activist and protester.\n\nSeif is a graduate student in cancer biology. She is studying the BRCA1 breast cancer gene and its mutation pattern in Egyptian patients. She says she has two full-time careers: one in cancer research, and another in human rights activism.\n\nIn the year leading up to the revolution Mona became involved in the dissident movement, spreading awareness and attending demonstrations. Between January 25 and February 5, the members of her immediate family and many members of their extended family participated in the Tahrir Square protests. Mona recalls \"It was a life-changing moment for most of the people in Tahrir Square. You could see the gunshots at people...\".\n\nSeif is a founding member of \"No to Military Trials for Civilians\", a group pushing for the release of those detained during the revolution; and end to trials of civilians by military courts; transfer of all such civilian facing trial to the jurisdiction of civilian courts; and the investigation of torture allegations involving military police. Seif wrote on her blog \"Ma3t\", about the military police during crackdowns on Tahrir protesters, requesting people come forward with their stories.\n\nShe has been critical of the actions of Egypt's interim ruling body the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) saying, of the release of protesters without full exoneration: “The fact that they have suspended sentences does not give them the pride they deserve as revolutionaries who did nothing wrong.\"\n\nSeif estimates that military courts have sentenced 7,000 civilians since former Hosni Mubarak's ouster in February, 2011. She notes that there has been a shift in the SCAF's approach since March and that protesters are now getting suspended sentences rather than the 3-5-year sentences they were previously getting. She speculates that this may be an attempt to stop the regular marches and may also be due to the pressure applied by international human right groups.\n\nShe has continued to criticize tactics of the SCAF: \"We have evidence that the military right now is targeting protesters. ... They selected known figures of the Tahrir protest. They selected people who were known and they tortured and beat them up...and if you read or listen to the testimonies of those who were released, which are a few, we still have a lot of people detained unconstitutionally. And you see that it's not just that they're getting tortured or beaten up, but there's an element of the Army trying to break the revolutionary spirit.\"\n\nPart of Seif's project involves asking detainees who have been released to record what happened to them. In some cases she says she has managed to get their testomies immediately after their release and so record bruise marks and burns. It is Seif's opinion that with these cases the only way to fight them is via the internet.\n\nIn 2012, she was a finalist for the Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk, which ultimately went to Syrian blogger Razan Ghazzawi.\n\nWhen it was announced in April 2013 that Seif was a finalist for the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders presented by Human Rights Watch, both she and HRW were criticised for what some considered taking a firm pro-Palestinian stance. The specific accusations, made by the pro-Zionist UN WATCH were that she tweeted support for violence in the form of attacks on the Egypt-Israel-Jordan gas pipeline; invasion of the Israeli embassy in Cairo and missile attacks on Israel. The accusations were examined and dismissed in detail by Scott Long, who denied the 3 tweets, of 93,000 examined, showed any evidence whatsoever of support for violence.\n\n\n"}

The disease left him with an atrophied leg and a permanent limp on his walk, which prevented him from playing. However, he did not give up his dream of being part of the footballing world, and decided to learn other aspects of the game. Autuori worked as a physical coach for clubs such as Portuguesa (RJ), and Nacional in Portugal. At Nacional, Paulo Autuori was promoted to manager of the main team, and has enjoyed a successful coaching career ever since.\n\nAutuori graduated in Physical Education at Universidade Castelo Branco; and attended a Sport Admninstration course at PUC-RJ and a Soccer Coach Course at UERJ.\n\nAutuori coached some teams from Portugal: Nacional, Vitória de Guimarães, Marítimo and Benfica; from Brazil: Portuguesa (RJ), Botafogo, Cruzeiro, Flamengo, Internacional, Santos and São Paulo; and from Peru: Alianza Lima, Sporting Cristal and the Peru national team.\n\nTowards the end of April 2005, just before quitting Peru, he was hired by São Paulo FC to replace Émerson Leão, who had just gone to Japan. In that year, he won the Copa Libertadores 2005 and the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship.\n\nOn 29 December 2005, he resigned São Paulo to sign with Kashima Antlers, from Japan. At the end of 2006 he announced his new club as Cruzeiro E.C., this was his third time at the club.\n\nOn 12 November 2009, Paulo Autuori has decided to leave Gremio, after have reached an agreement with the club. Gremio decided to let free the manager, because they can't win the championship title.\n\nOn 21 November 2009, Qatar League side Al Rayyan have replaced Brazilian coach Marcus Paqueta with his compatriot Paulo Autuori. The latter only left the club six months ago to join Gremio in his homeland, but has made a swift return after signing a three-year contract.\n\nPaulo Autuori became the coach of the Qatar Olympic team on 27 August 2011.

In 2005, as coach for \"Tricolor\", he won two important titles: Copa Libertadores 2005 and 2005 FIFA Club World Championship. This time, however, Autuori is arriving in São Paulo to solve a crisis, the club losing its five last games.\n\nOn the following day, Autuori was introduced as the new coach despite the preference of many fans, who wanted Muricy Ramalho's return. The new coach of São Paulo said that, if the choice were his he would have signed Ramalho who Autuori considered a \"winner\". Autuori affirmed that he felt \"a lot of satisfaction to return to this glorious institution, with big aims.\" The former \"vascaíno\" coach said that \"I have not come to be loved; I have come to be champion.\"\n\nEven in a middle of a crisis, Autuori has improved the ambient in São Paulo FC, a bad one in comparison to period that Ney Franco was the coach. The Lúcio's removal from staff, according some people of club, was essential for this.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, Autuori was dismissed by directors of São Paulo FC after the 2–0 loss against Coritiba FC, a result that kept the club in relegation zone of Brazilian League. In a report from official site of club, there is a praising about his work. His substitute is Muricy Ramalho, that, ironically, also replaced him in 2006 in club from Morumbi Stadium.\n\nOn 5 June 2018 Autuori was announced as the new Director of football in the Bulgarian champion Ludogorets Razgrad, but on the next day he was presented as the new manager of the team, since Dimitar Dimitrov wanted to leave the club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He received the Medal of Honor for his actions on March 9, 1951.\n\nHarvey enlisted in the United States Army on August 16, 1939.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the 79th Infantry Division, landing in Normandy, France one week after the Invasion of Normandy and participating in the division's campaigns in northern France and Germany. Harvey was decorated for valor several times, earning the Distinguished Service Cross (second only to the Medal of Honor), two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts.\n\nAfter World War II ended, Harvey entered the Army's Organized Reserve, and returned to active duty in 1948. He was serving with the 7th Infantry Division in 1950 when the Korean War began, and landed with the division at Inchon, Korea in September 1950. Shortly after the landing, and before the Chinese counterattack in November 1950, Harvey took command of the division's Company C, 17th Infantry Regiment.\n\nHarvey was in command of the company the following March, when it led the attack of 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment on Hill 1232 near Taemi-Dong, where Harvey would earn the Medal of Honor. On that day, Harvey commanding Company C of the 17th Infantry Regiment, received orders to lead the attack on Hill 1232 overlooking Taemi-dong. But North Korean machine gun nests canvassed the hillside inside fortifications. Harvey and his men were soon pinned down under a hail of North Korean machine gun fire.\n\nSuddenly, Harvey charged up the hill alone in the face of enemy fire. Harvey tossed grenades into the first pillbox he got to, killing those inside. Then Harvey advanced on the next entrenchment and dispatched all five occupants with his M1 carbine. The men of Company C eventually joined Harvey, only to watch their commander charge the next machine gun nest. He single-handedly wiped out gunners in another fortification while taking a bullet to the chest.\n\nEyewitnesses then saw Harvey, bleeding and probably moving on adrenaline, crawl toward another enemy stronghold disguised with logs. He burst upon them with his carbine. Unable to move, he ordered his men to complete the mission with a final push. Harvey refused medical care until Hill 1232 had been taken.\n\nWounded in the battle, Harvey was presented a third Silver Star while in the aid station, for bravery in the fall 1950 campaign after the Inchon landings. On July 5, 1951, Harvey was presented the Medal of Honor by President Harry S Truman at a White House ceremony. Truman called them the \"backbone of the government\" and the \"reason we will win the Cold War.\" He then added with a touch of reverence that he would rather have that Medal of Honor than be president.\n\nRank and organization: Captain, U.S. Army, Company C, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division\n\nPlace and date: Vicinity of Taemi-Dong, Korea, March 9, 1951\n\nEntered service at: Pasadena, Calif.

Harvey Company C, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. When his company was pinned down by a barrage of automatic weapons fire from numerous well-entrenched emplacements, imperiling accomplishment of its mission, Capt. Harvey braved a hail of fire and exploding grenades to advance to the first enemy machine gun nest, killing its crew with grenades. Rushing to the edge of the next emplacement, he killed its crew with carbine fire. He then moved the 1st Platoon forward until it was again halted by a curtain of automatic fire from well fortified hostile positions. Disregarding the hail of fire, he personally charged and neutralized a third emplacement. Miraculously escaping death from intense crossfire, Capt. Harvey continued to lead the assault. Spotting an enemy pillbox well camouflaged by logs, he moved close enough to sweep the emplacement with carbine fire and throw grenades through the openings, annihilating its 5 occupants. Though wounded he then turned to order the company forward, and, suffering agonizing pain, he continued to direct the reduction of the remaining hostile positions, refusing evacuation until assured that the mission would be accomplished. Capt. Harvey's valorous and intrepid actions served as an inspiration to his company, reflecting the utmost glory upon himself and upholding the heroic traditions of the military service.\n\nHarvey was assigned by the U.S. Army to be military technical adviser to Samuel Fuller for his Korean War film \"Fixed Bayonets!\" (1951). The two of them struck up a friendship with Harvey also acting as technical advisor on Fuller's \"Verboten!\" (1958) and accompanied Fuller and his wife to Europe at the end of the 1950s to scout locations for a projected filming of \"The Big Red One\" for Warner Bros. that did not eventuate. Harvey remained in the Army after the Korean War and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel before retiring in 1962. After retirement, he was employed by the Northrop Corporation, then worked as an investment banker, and then served as Director of Indian Affairs for the Arizona Division of Emergency Services. He retired fully after a stroke in 1981.\n\nHe died in 1996 at the age of 76 and is buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia.\n\nRaymond Harvey's military awards include individual decorations for combat he received from the U.S. Army: the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, three Silver Stars, three Bronze Star Medals and three Purple Hearts, makes him one of the most highly decorated infantry soldiers in U.S Army history.

German society has been affected by a Catholic-Protestant divide since the Protestant Reformation, and the same effect is visible in this list of German Chancellors. It is largely dominated by Roman Catholics and Lutherans as these remain the main confessions in the country.\n\nThe current German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is a Lutheran Protestant within the Evangelical Church.\n\nMost of Germany's chancellors have been either Lutherans or Roman Catholics. A significant portion of Protestant chancellors belonged to the Prussian Union of churches, which united the Reformed and Lutheran confessions throughout the Kingdom of Prussia, and was in force since 1817. Some Roman Catholic chancellors came from the Catholic Centre Party. The Christian Democratic Union, a party of both Roman Catholics and Protestants, produced both kinds of chancellors. One chancellor, namely Philipp Scheidemann, was Reformed (Calvinist).\n\nAlthough there were some religiously sceptic chancellors, most never officially renounced their faith and were given a Christian funeral. Hermann Müller, a Social Democrat heavily influenced by his father-an advocate of Ludwig Feuerbach's views, is the only one notable for not having been a member of any confession at all. Friedrich Ebert was baptised a Roman Catholic, but later officially left the denomination. Gustav Bauer is on record as unaffiliated to any recognised religion at least from 1912 to 1924 (thus including his term of office), but he was buried on a Protestant cemetery.\n\nAs some chancellors' views are uncertain or causing confusion among researchers, such as these of Adolf Hitler or Joseph Goebbels, the official religion they were brought up in is only mentioned with a further information on their worldviews, if available. For issues pertaining to Nazi stance on religion, see Religion in Nazi Germany, Religious aspects of Nazism, and Religious views of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThis table doesn't include Walter Scheel, a Lutheran who served as acting Chancellor in May 1974.\n\n"}

Running with the support of the Tea Party movement, he defeated six-term incumbent U.S. Senator Richard Lugar in the May 2012 Republican primary election. He lost the November 6, 2012, general election for Lugar's seat to Democratic U. S. Representative Joe Donnelly.\n\nMourdock was born in Wauseon, Ohio, the son of Dolores Elaine (Bobel) and David Lee Mourdock. He grew up in Bucyrus, Ohio. His father worked as an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper. Richard graduated from Wynford High School in Bucyrus in 1969, earned a Bachelor of Science in natural systems from Defiance College in 1973 and a Master of Arts in geology from Ball State University in 1975.\n\nAfter completing his education, Mourdock took a position as a field geologist with AMAX Coal Company and was working as Surface Mine Geology Project Coordinator the time of his departure from the company in 1979. From 1979 to 1984, Mourdock was employed by Standard Oil of Ohio as a senior geologist and ultimately became chief geologist for the company. In 1984, Mourdock accepted a position with Koester Companies in Evansville, Indiana. For sixteen years, Mourdock served as Vice President of the company's coal subsidiary and eventually became Vice President of Business Development for the parent company. In addition, Mourdock served as a trustee for the company's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). After leaving Koester, Mourdock founded and ran his own environmental consulting business, R. E. Mourdock & Associates.\n\nMourdock ran in 1988, 1990 and 1992 for the U.S. House of Representatives, seeking to represent Indiana's 8th congressional district. In 1988, he was defeated in the Republican primary. In 1990 and 1992, he won the Republican nomination but was defeated by Democrat Frank McCloskey in the general election, 55–45% and 53–45%, respectively.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2002, Mourdock served two terms as an elected member of Vanderburgh County Board of Commissioners, the county's executive governing body. In 2002, Mourdock sought the Republican nomination for Indiana Secretary of State—a position chosen at the party's convention. In the three-way contest, Mourdock and fellow conservative Mike Delph split the conservative vote, with the result that the more moderate Todd Rokita won the nomination In 2004, Mourdock unsuccessfully sought a seat on the Vanderburgh County Council.\n\nIn 2006, he ran for Indiana treasurer, winning most of the counties in the northern portion of the state, and defeating Michael W. Griffin, 52%–48%. Mourdock began his first four-year term in February 2007. In 2009, in his role as state treasurer, he sued to stop the federal bailout of Chrysler, contending that the bailout plan violated U.S. bankruptcy law by giving more funds to unsecured creditors than it did secured creditors including three Indiana pension funds. Though the suit was unsuccessful, it helped Mourdock gain national recognition.\n\nMourdock was re-elected in November 2010 against naval officer Pete Buttigieg, 62%–38%, receiving more than 1,000,000 votes.\n\nMourdock resigned from his position as treasurer on August 29, 2014, effective immediately. Governor Mike Pence appointed chief financial officer and chief operating officer of the Indiana Finance Authority Daniel Huge to serve as interim treasurer. Mourdock's resignation came on the last day that state employees could retire before cuts to pension benefits took effect in September 2014.\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Mourdock announced he would challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Richard Lugar in the 2012 Republican primary. At the announcement, Mourdock criticized Lugar for his support of the auto bailouts, his votes in favor of the DREAM Act and the START treaty and his opposition to earmark reform. He said Indiana needed a senator who would return home to hold town halls, and not \"a globe-trotting Senator\", like Lugar. Mourdock later criticized Lugar's record on bipartisanship, his authorship of the 1991 Nunn-Lugar Act to secure and dismantle weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union, and the 2006 expansion of the legislation to cover conventional weapons stockpiles and secure loose nukes. He called Lugar \"President Obama's favorite Republican\", referring to an October 2008 MSNBC article titled, \"Barack Obama's favorite Republican?\", which had described Lugar as a \"loyal Republican\" while reporting on a 10-day international trip Lugar and then-Senator Obama had taken in 2005 to inspect weapons sites.\n\nAt the time he announced his candidacy, Mourdock released a list of 12 Republican state central committee members and 67 GOP county chairs who endorsed him; he soon began gathering tea party support as well. He spoke at over two dozen local tea party gatherings across Indiana where he gained name recognition and support. At a 2011 local tea party convention in Greenfield, Indiana, Mourdock received 96 of the 97 straw poll votes cast. In the week before the primary, political action groups such as FreedomWorks, the NRA, National Right to Life, and 45 local tea party groups held a get-out-the-vote rally for Mourdock that was attended by 500 tea party members along with Reverend C.L. Bryant and FOX News political commentator Michelle Malkin. Mourdock addressed the rally praising the support he had been given by FreedomWorks and similar groups, and adding that the tea party movement was very much alive \"showing up to work for campaigns.\"\n\nDuring the primary campaign, tea party-backed organizations such as Liberty News Network and America ReFocused campaigned door to door, sent out mailers and helped sponsor TV and radio ads. Mourdock's largest contributor was the Club for Growth which accounted for 40% of all outside spending, contributing $2.2 million. According to campaign finance records, some of Mourdock's other top donors and the respective amounts they have contributed are the NRA, $491,000; Citizens United Political Victory Fund, $96,300; and FreedomWorks For America, $437,184.\n\nOn May 8, 2012, Mourdock defeated Lugar in the primary, capturing just over 60% of the vote. Mourdock's victory was attributed in part to voter dissatisfaction with Lugar's moderate record as well as his absence from Indiana; he had not had a residence in the state since 1977. During his concession speech, Lugar criticized Mourdock for having an \"unrelenting partisan mind-set\" and predicted he would be an ineffective legislator; Mourdock in turn, praised Lugar's record of public service. Indiana political analyst Brian Howey ascribed Mourdock's primary win to Republican voters' belief that Lugar was too old and that he had been in Congress too long. Howey also said that \"Just 15% ... voted for Mourdock because of his Tea Party ideology.\"\n\nMourdock faced Democratic nominee Joe Donnelly and Libertarian nominee Andy Horning in the general election. Mourdock said that if elected to the Senate, he would limit himself to two terms.\n\nMourdock had been endorsed by several conservative interest groups, including the Americans for Prosperity, Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, Citizens United and the Tea Party Express, the National Rifle Association (NRA), and Indiana Right to life. During the general election campaign, millions of dollars were spent by outside groups supporting both Mourdock and his opponent, Donnelley. Only three other US Senate races reportedly attracted more outside money.\n\nAlthough heavily favored to win in a GOP stronghold state, Mourdock lost to Democratic nominee Joe Donnelly in the general election after the media attention over his comment that \"life is that gift from God that I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"\n\nMourdock has questioned the constitutionality of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, saying to a group of supporters: \"I challenge you in of the United States Constitution where those so-called Enumerated powers are listed. I challenge you to find words that talk about Medicare or Medicaid or, yes, even Social Security.\" Mourdock does not support cutting benefits for current Medicare beneficiaries, but he does support a new voucher plan for those under age 55. Mourdock also believes the age of eligibility for Medicare should be increased from 65 to 67. Mourdock believes Social Security should be reformed to allow younger workers to invest in personalized retirement accounts. and that it will be necessary to increase the retirement age to collect Social Security benefits.\n\nAs a candidate for Congress in 1992, Mourdock stated that he supported legal abortion in the case of some \"crisis pregnancies\", but did not believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control. During his 2012 U.S. Senate race, he reiterated that he opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother. At an October 23, 2012, candidate debate, Mourdock explained why he is opposed to abortion even when the pregnancy is the result of rape:\n\nI, too, certainly stand for life. I know there are some who disagree, and I respect their point of view. But I believe that life begins at conception. The only exception I have, to have an abortion, is in that case of the life of the mother. I've struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"\n\nDan Parker, chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party, immediately attacked Mourdock, saying that, \"I'm stunned and ashamed that Richard Mourdock believes God intended rape\", and that he is an \"extremist\" who is out of touch with Indiana. Speculation that Mourdock's remark could affect the outcome of the Senate race centered on attempts to liken his comments to those of Todd Akin.\n\nResponding to Parker, Mourdock issued a statement saying: \"God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick.\" He later added, \"I believe God controls the universe. I don't believe biology works in an uncontrolled fashion.\" A number of Republican officials and candidates, including Sen. John McCain, called for him to issue an apology, but Mourdock refused. He instead aired a television ad titled \"Leadership\" several days after the comments stating that Democrats and Democratic PACs were \"mocking Richard Mourdock's religious faith and twisting his words(...) playing politics and distracting from the real issues\". One week after the remark, Mourdock was greeted enthusiastically by the attendees of a semiannual dinner for prominent Indiana Republican officials and supporters.\n\nMourdock lost to Donnelly by almost 6 percent in the general election.\n\nMourdock has called for cuts in federal spending and for a balanced budget. On his website, Mourdock has said that he supports the Ryan Path to Prosperty Plan. However, Mourdock has also said that \"'Ryan's overall budget proposal might not go far enough, fast enough\"; Mourdock would like to shrink government spending by $7.6 trillion in 10 years, (as opposed to Ryan's budget which would cut $5.5 trillion). Mourdock said he would not have supported the Troubled Assets Relief Program and opposed the bailout of GM and Chrysler which included measures causing losses to secured bondholders in retirement funds he managed as treasurer. He would abolish earmarks.\n\nMourdock opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants and opposes the DREAM Act.\n\nIn February 2012, Murdoch told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) that bipartisanship has nearly bankrupted the country, and that confrontation, not collegiality was needed. In an interview on MSNBC in May 2012 Murdoch said, \"bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view...If we win the House, Senate, and White House, bipartisanship means they have to come our way\". In the same interview he said, \"To me, the highlight of politics, frankly, is to inflict my opinion on someone else.\" Republican 2012 Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan later expressed his disagreement with Mourdock's statement, saying, \"I obviously don't agree with that.\"\n\nMourdock is a pilot, motorcyclist and an avid runner who has completed nine marathons, including one on his 60th birthday. He first began entering marathons at age 49. He formerly built open-wheel modified race cars and raced them on dirt roads. He is a history buff who has been a speaker on the subjects of early U.S. politics and Abraham Lincoln. Mourdock is a longtime active member of the non-denominational evangelical Christian Fellowship Church in Evansville and has made a number of Christian missionary trips through his church to Bolivia. He resides in Darmstadt, Indiana, a small town near Evansville, with his wife, Marilyn.\n\n"}

He was operated on by a team of volunteers at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA) in Sydney, Australia, headed by senior plastic surgeon, Dr David Pennington. Safari spent almost twelve months in Australia, in and out of hospital, for his 14 operations. Before his surgery he was malnourished and only able to eat mashed bananas and milk because of severe contractures of his mouth and neck. His plight was discovered by Lesley Coverdale who was visiting with a friend in the area where Safari lived. She returned to Australia and began raising funds for his treatment. In a chance meeting with Ms Coverdale, Pennington, the Head of RPA's Department of Plastic Surgery, offered to operate on Safari gratis. Further funds to accomplish this were raised through the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and after nearly a year he was flown to Australia for treatment. At the end of his twelve-month treatment program in 2000, he was able to eat normally and was enabled to use his arm and hand for day-to-day activities.\n\nHis case was brought to the attention of the Australian public primarily through the television series \"RPA\" which was filmed at the hospital, and covered Safari's rehabilitation over the course of a year. Safari became a household name as the large RPA audience followed his progress from week to week. Safari's travel and accommodation expenses were paid for by ADRA, which also raised funds to assist Safari's village in Kenya. Channel Nine assisted in his return to Kenya.\n\nSafari lives with foster parents in Australia. He is studying at St. Philip's Christian College.\n\nSafari is from Kasaala, a small village in the Ikutha Division of Kitui District, in the Eastern Province of Kenya, a country in East Africa. The village is located by the Tsavo National Park. He was born around the year 1994.\n\nThe book \"Let the Journey Begin: Safari's Story\", was published in 2001.\n\nAfter Safari returned to Africa, his mother tragically died in 2003 from a snakebite.\n\nAs of 2007, Safari lives with foster parents Janet Seath and Frank Scaysbrook in the town of Buttaba, in the City of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, Australia. The couple has published the book \"Safari: I Won't Cry, Mother\".\n\nIn 2001, Seath and Scaysbrook criticised the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), a major sponsor, for allegedly not providing promised funds to Safari's village and for his education (ADRA had raised $180,000). On January 7, 2001, Seath & Scaysbrook's criticisms were aired on Channel 7's television program, \"Today Tonight\" (rival to Nine's \"A Current Affair\") and on Sydney radio station 2GB. In response, ADRA rejected the charges, and quoted a formal NSW state government investigation that had found the complaint to be unjustified. Dr. David Pennington, the head of plastic surgery at the RPA hospital, and who led the surgical team, also rejected the charges. The reason why funds were slow to be disbursed was that they had to pass through Kenyan government channels in order to fund an upgrade of the Kasaala Medical Clinic and extensions to the Kasaala school. However, these funds eventually did flow to the benefit of the Kasaala community.\n\n"}

His nation lived in an area extending from Lake of Two Mountains to modern-day Pembroke, Ontario.\n\nTessouat lived in L'Isle-aux-Allumettes, in a neck of the Ottawa River. He was described by the French settlers as having a strong character. He was also blind in one eye (in French, borgne) and was dubbed \"le Borgne de l'isle\". His position was highly strategic, as the Ottawa River was the safest way to go from the St. Lawrence River to Hudson Bay and to Huronia, near Georgian Bay. Tessouat took advantage of his position to impose some sort of customs duties on the French fur traders navigating on the Ottawa River, as well as to impose some of his authority. For example, in 1633, he refused to let the Jesuits go to Huronia, fearing he would lose authority in the region. To maintain the economic supremacy of the Kitchisipirini, he made great efforts to keep his French, Wendat (Huron), and Odawa allies from trading with each other directly, preferring that they trade through Algonquin middlemen.\n\nAt that time, the Algonquins, Wendats, and several other Great Lakes First Nations were at war with the Iroquois Confederacy. Yet, Tessouat initiated peace talks with the Mohawk nation and, in 1634, they agreed to a peace treaty. The alleged motive behind this political move was to gain access to the Dutch settlers in what is now known the New York State, perhaps in order to be in a better negotiating position with the French traders. Peace with the Mohawks only lasted two years and Tessouat died a few months after bloody fights against the Mohawks.\n\nIn 1641, after Tessouat's death, in the fashion of an Algonquian custom, a new Tessouat was reborn. The custom consisted of bringing back to life an important dead chief in a highly spectacular ritual. The new Tessouat was brought to life to save the Kitchesipirini nation, which was by then afflicted by death, caused by the European diseases, and isolated after several losses to the Iroquian confederation. Strangely enough, the new Tessouat was also blind in one eye. This fact probably contributed to muddle the French, who sometimes did not distinguish the new Tessouat from the old one. To save his nation, the new Tessouat decided to move from the Ottawa River area to a place nearby the French. After going to Sillery (nearby Quebec), where the Wendats refused their hospitality, Tessouat decides to bring his nation to Montreal island, where he agrees to receive the Christian baptism. In 1647, fearing an attack from the Iroquois and suspecting that the French would not defend them, Tessouat and his nation moved again. The new Tessouat finally died at Trois-Rivières, in 1654.\n\n\n"}

In person, he went by Charles Criswell King, and was sometimes credited as Jeron King Criswell.\n\nCriswell was flamboyant, with spit curled hair, a stentorian style of speaking, and a sequined tuxedo. He owned a coffin in which he claimed to sleep. He grew up in a troubled family in Indiana with relatives who owned a funeral home, and said that he became comfortable with sleeping in caskets in the storeroom. He appeared in two of Ed Wood's films.\n\nCriswell said he had once worked as a radio announcer and news broadcaster. He began buying time on a local Los Angeles television station in the early 1950s to run infomercials for his Criswell Family Vitamins. To fill the time, he began his \"Criswell Predicts\" part of the show. This made him a minor off-beat celebrity in Los Angeles and around Hollywood, and his friendship with old show-business people such as Mae West and rising fringe celebrities such as Korla Pandit made Criswell an entertaining presence at parties. His fame brought him appearances on \"The Jack Paar Show\" (1957–1962) which allowed him to publish his predictions in three publications of Spaceway Magazine (February 1955, April 1955, and June 1955), as well as run a weekly syndicated newspaper article starting on September 6, 1951. He later published three books of predictions; \"From Now to the Year 2000\", \"Your Next Ten Years\", and \"Forbidden Predictions\". He also recorded a long playing record, \"Your Incredible Future\" (which was later released on CD), featuring 84 minutes of his predictions in his own voice. Criswell appeared in the movies of writer and director Ed Wood. After Criswell's death, his longtime friend Paul Marco released Criswell's song \"Someone Walked Over My Grave\" on a 7\" record which was recorded by Criswell as a memorial song that he wanted released posthumously.\n\nCriswell's predictions were nationally syndicated and he appeared on the television show \"Criswell Predicts\" on KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13) in Los Angeles as well as being recorded for syndication. His announcer was Bob Shields, who later played the judge on \"Divorce Court\". Criswell wore heavy makeup in public after his live program was broadcast in Los Angeles. Only selected people were allowed in the KCOP studio during his broadcast.\n\nCriswell wrote several books of predictions, including 1968's \"Criswell Predicts: From Now to the Year 2000.\" In it, he claimed that Denver, Colorado would be struck by a ray from space that would cause all metal to adopt the qualities of rubber, leading to horrific accidents at amusement parks. He predicted mass cannibalism and the end of planet Earth, which he set as happening on August 18, 1999. Neither became reality.\n\nCriswell was a student of history. He believed history repeated itself, that the United States were the \"modern Romans\". Each day, he read the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" looking for clues for his predictions.\n\nSome sources claim Criswell's most famous prediction was on \"The Jack Paar Program\" (1962–65) in March 1963, when he predicted that US President John F. Kennedy would not run for reelection in 1964 because something was going to happen to him in November 1963.\n\nSources say that Criswell never claimed to be a real psychic; however, those who knew him, including actress and fellow \"Plan 9\" alumna Maila Nurmi (\"Vampira\"), believed he was. According to writer Charles A. Coulombe, whose family rented an apartment from him, Criswell told Coulombe's father \"[I] had the gift, but ... lost it when I started taking money for it.\"\n\nCriswell married a former speakeasy dancer named Halo Meadows, who once appeared on \"You Bet Your Life\", and whom Coulombe describes as \"quite mad\": \"Mrs Criswell had a huge standard poodle (named \"Buttercup\") which she was convinced was the reincarnation of her cousin Thomas. She spent a great deal of time sunbathing ... which, given her size, was not too pleasing a sight.\"\n\nMae West used Criswell as her personal psychic; he once predicted her rise to President of the United States, whereupon she, Criswell and George Liberace, the brother of showman Liberace, would take a rocket to the Moon. Criswell and West were great friends and she would lavish him with home-cooked food which she had delivered to the studio that he shared with Maila Nurmi (\"Vampira\"). It is said that West sold Criswell her old luxury cars for five dollars.\n\nHe died in 1982.\n\n\n"}

According to others Tirimüjgan Kadınefendi was born in historical Circassia in the Caucasus (present-day western Russia), and belonged to the Shapsug tribe of the Circassians. Her father was Bekhan Bey and her mother was Almaş Hanım.\n\nShe was given the name \"Tirimüjgan\" in the Ottoman Empire. She was among the longest serving kalfas at the palace for her refinement, her politeness, and her beauty. In her memoirs, Ayşe Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, depicts Tirimüjgan Kadınefendi as having \"green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet.\" Ayşe Sultan adds that \"Old Circassian women at the palace used to tell that she [Tirimüjgan] was from the Shapsug tribe, and I also remember my father [Abdul Hamid II] referring to every Shapsug Adyghe [Circassian] girl as \"Our Valide's (\"mother\") kind\".

Sultan Abdul Hamid II was her second child, while her third child was Şehzade Mehmed Abid Efendi, who died in May 1848 around the age of one month.\n\nWhenever Sultan Abdülhamid II would speak of his mother, he would say: \"My poor mother left this world at such a young age, but I can still picture her.

Originally a business manager for other theatre licensees in the 1880s, he branched out as an independent manager in the 1890s and was associated with various London theatres, principally the Lyric, the Savoy and the Adelphi Theatres.\n\nGreet was the seventh child and eldest son of Captain Wiliam Greet R.N., commander of the recruiting ship H.M.S. Crocodile, and the former Sarah Vallance Barling. Greet's younger brother was the actor-manager Ben Greet. Greet was born on his father's ship, christened at St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London, and educated at the Royal Naval School, New Cross. He served as a Lieutenant of the Royal Marine Artillery from 1871 to 1877. \n\nHe worked first as a farmer and then began working in theatre management in the 1880s. Between 1884 and 1890, Greet was successively business manager at the Toole's Theatre under its licensee, J. L. Toole, the Novelty Theatre (licensee, Willie Edouin), the Royalty Theatre (licensee, Kate Santley), the Prince of Wales's Theatre (licensee, Horace Sedger), and from 1890 to 1894 the Lyric Theatre, also for Sedger, with whom Greet's wife collaborated on a stage adaptation of the novel \"The Little Squire\".\n\nGreet became a producer and theatre manager in his own right in 1894, as licensee of the Avenue Theatre, starting successfully with the long-running \"Dandy Dick Whittington\" by George R. Sims and Ivan Caryll and a popular comedy by F. C. Burnand, \"Mrs Ponderbury's Past\" (later billed as \"Mrs Ponderbury\"), directed by and starring Charles Hawtrey. In 1896, Greet gave up the licence at the Avenue and moved to the Lyric, where he presented the long-running \"The Sign of the Cross\" by Wilson Barrett, also producing an American tour of the play. He followed that success with another, \"Dandy Dan the Lifeguardsman\" by Basil Hood and Walter Slaughter, starring Arthur Roberts and W. H. Denny. Greet sat on the Board of Directors of The Lyceum Theatre Ltd. from 1899 until 1902.\n\nIn 1901, Greet leased the Savoy Theatre from Helen Carte, the widow of Richard D'Oyly Carte. He then managed the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of \"Iolanthe\" at the Savoy and its production of several new comic operas including \"The Emerald Isle\", \"Merrie England\" (1902) and \"A Princess of Kensington\" (1903), both at the Savoy and on tour. At the same time, he also leased the Lyric Theatre in London, producing \"Mice and Men\" in 1902, \"The Light that Failed\" in 1903 and the musical comedies \"The Medal and the Maid\" (1903), and \"The Duchess of Dantzic\" (1904). He also leased the Comedy Theatre in London, where he produced the hit musicals \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" and \"Morocco Bound\", both in 1902.\n\nGreet continued to produce musical comedies and operettas, many of them very successful, including \"The Earl and the Girl\" at the Adelphi Theatre (1903), \"The Talk of the Town\" (1905, Lyric Theatre), \"Blue Moon\" (1905, Lyric), \"The Sign of the Cross\" (Terriss Theatre), \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1908), \"A White Man\" (1908, Lyric), \"Little Hans Andersen\" (1909, by Basil Hood), \"The Fires of Fate\" (1909, Lyric), \"The Rivals\" (1910, Lyric), \"The Chocolate Soldier\" (1910, Lyric), \"Baby Mine\" (1911, Vaudeville Theatre), \"Nightbirds\" (1911, Lyric), and \"The Girl in the Taxi\" (1912, Lyric).\n\nGreet died in Bournemouth at the age of 62 and was buried at Shillingford.\n\n\n"}

They are generally employed by wineries or , where their work includes:\n\nToday, these duties require an increasing amount of scientific knowledge, since laboratory tests are gradually supplementing or replacing traditional methods. Winemakers can also be referred to as oenologists as they study oenology – the science of wine.\n\nA vintner is a wine merchant. In some modern use, particularly in American English, the term is also used as a synonym for winemaker.\n\nThe term started in Middle English, superseding the earlier term \"vinter\".\n\nDue to the close political and commercial ties between Bordeaux and England during the 14th and early 15th centuries, vintners were among the more important people in London with winemakers being four times mayor of the city under the reign of Edward II.\n\nA vigneron is someone who cultivates a vineyard for winemaking. The word connotes or emphasizes the critical role that vineyard placement and maintenance has in the production of high-quality wine. The term, French for someone who grows grapes or makes wine, is often used in Australia to describe a winemaker who is also involved as an owner or manager as opposed to a person who is employed only to make wine, who is generally referred to as a winemaker. It is also used when referring to a winemaker from France.\n\nVincent of Saragossa is the patron saint of vignerons.\n\nA négociant is the French term for a wine merchant who assembles the produce of smaller growers and winemakers and sells the result under its own name.\n\nNégociants buy everything from grapes to grape must to wines in various states of completion. In the case of grapes or must, the \"négociant\" performs virtually all the winemaking. If he buys already fermented wine in barrels or \"en-vrac\"—basically in bulk containers, he may age the wine further, blend in other wines or simply bottle and sell it as is. The result is sold under the name of the \"négociant\", not the name of the original grape or wine producer.\n\nSome \"négociants\" have a recognizable house style.\n\n\"Négociants\", who are also called wine merchants/traders, were the dominant force in the wine trade until the last 25 years for various reasons:\n\nMany \"négociants\" are also vineyard owners in their own right. In Burgundy for instance, \"négociants\" as Bouchard Père et Fils and Faiveley are among the largest owners of vineyards. Well-known \"négociants\" in Burgundy are Maison Louis Jadot, Joseph Drouhin, and Vincent Girardin; in Beaujolais, Georges Duboeuf; in Province, Mirabeau; and in the Rhône region, Guigal, Jaboulet, Jean-Luc Colombo, Chapoutier, and Famille Perrin\".\n\n\n"}
