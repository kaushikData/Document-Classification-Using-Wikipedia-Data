{"id": "58440618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58440618", "title": "Alecu Beldiman", "text": "Alecu Beldiman\n\nAlecu Beldiman, common rendition of Alexandru Beldiman (Romanian Cyrillic: AлєѯaндрȢ Бєлдимaн), also known as Alecul or Aleco Beldiman (1760–ca. January 1826), was a Moldavian statesman, translator and poet, one of the forerunners of Romanian nationalism. A scion of the boyar elite, he was the eldest son of \"Vornic\" Gheorghe Beldiman, and the nephew-in-law of chronicler Enache Kogălniceanu. Alecu himself held high commission in the Moldavian military forces and bureaucracy, but secretly resented the Phanariote regime which had awarded them. He may have affiliated with a loose group known as the \"National Party\", championing an alliance between Moldavia's independence from the Ottoman Empire and support for the French Republic.\n\nBeldiman's earliest contributions to cultural life probably date back to the 1790s, and originally included translations of French prose and verse drama. He may have contributed an original play, while his brother, Dumitrache Beldiman, helped arrange some of the earliest Moldavian stage performances, as puppet shows. By 1820, Alecu had become the most productive translator in Moldavia, directly contributing to Westernization and the spread of Enlightenment ideas, and also completing a Romanian version of the \"Odyssey\". His works in the field were circulated in print form by Zaharia Carcalechi, or otherwise copied by hand.\n\nBeldiman's anti-Greek sentiment peaked during the 1821, when an invasion by the Sacred Band chased him and other Romanian boyars out of Moldavia. The invasion and its violent aftermath inspired him to write the epic poem \"Tragodiea Moldovei\" (\"Moldavia's Tragedy\"). Although politically significant and comprising picturesque detail, the work was widely dismissed as a sample of exceptionally bad writing. Upon returning home, Beldiman also came into conflict with Prince Ioan Sturdza, who had him imprisoned at Tazlău Monastery in 1824. Poems he wrote during that interval show him as a conservative critic of republican and nationalist propaganda, and display his pity for the lower classes; he was also becoming more supportive of rule by the Ottoman Empire. Though eventually released, he maintained a low profile for the remainder of his life. His family continued to have a role in Moldavian, and later Romanian politics; his grandson Alexandru Beldiman was a journalist.\n\nAccording to family tradition, Beldiman's ancestors crossed into Moldavia from the Principality of Transylvania. This would make them distant relatives of the Hungarian Counts of Beldi. The immigrants entered historical record in March 1579, when \"a certain Beldiman\" served as Mayor (\"Șoltuz\") of Suceava. In April 1609, Nichifor Beldiman, recorded in some genealogies as a \"nemeș\" (untitled landowner), became \"Vornic\". He later served as Hetman and Logothete, and, in late 1615, led the boyars into rebellion against Prince Ștefan IX Tomșa. He was captured in neighboring Wallachia and beheaded, his remains being disposed of in the Siret River. His two sons continued to hold major boyar ranks, while his daughter married into the Prăjescu family.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the family lost its economic prosperity and political influence, and came to be regarded as emancipated peasants, rather than as boyars. Isolated in the rural areas of Fălciu County, they were often known by the nickname \"Mânja\". Alecu Beldiman's grandfather, Grigore Mânja Beldiman, rectified the situation. From beginnings as a page at the court of Prince Constantin Cantemir, he became fluent in Ottoman Turkish in Istanbul, where he also befriended \"Beizadea\" Dimitrie Cantemir. In 1711, following the Pruth River Campaign, the Cantemirs were chased out of the country; a Beldiman branch also left Moldavia and settled in the Russian Empire.\n\nThese events led to the emergence of a Phanariote regime in Moldavia and Wallachia: from ca. 1711, both Danubian Principalities had lost much of their autonomy within the Ottoman Empire; the boyar elite, formed mainly by Greek immigrants, controlled the administration. Grigore Mânja survived this time of troubles, and emerged as a favorite of the early Phanariotes: Nicholas Mavrocordatos and Grigore II Ghica both made used of his services. However, his participation in boyar conspiracies during the third reign of Mihai Racoviță endangered his career and his life. Alecu's father was Gheorghe Beldiman (1724–1792). Orphaned of both parents by 1735, he and his four brothers were virtually adopted by the returning Prince Ghica, who groomed them for high office. Gheorghe amassed a personal fortune while climbing through the ranks, serving as \"Stolnic\" in 1763, \"Ban\" in 1773, and finally \"Vornic\" in 1790. During the Russo-Turkish War of the 1770s, he declared his personal submission to Catherine the Great. He remained a noted figure in the Russophile party, and as a result earned a permanent appointment to the Moldavian Divan in 1774. \n\nHis son's birth came during the final stages of the Phanariote era. Alecu was born in 1760, either in Iași, the Moldavian capital, or in the smaller town of Huși. His maternal family was Greek. His mother, Maria, was the daughter of \"publican Lefter\" from Istanbul; her sister was married to Enache Kogălniceanu, the Moldavian chronicler and social reformer. The couple had an older daughter, Anastasia, and three younger sons: Iancu, Filip, and Dumitrache.\nEarly on, Alecu became fluent in Greek and more unusually for his generation, also in French. He was educated at home and in private Greek schools—unlike Dumitrache, who was a graduate of the Princely Academy. He climbed steadily through the boyar hierarchy, becoming \"Ceauș\" in the Moldavian military forces in 1785; he was \"Serdar\" in 1789. At age 34, Alecu became a \"Paharnic\" at the princely court of Michael Drakos Soutzos, before being moved to serve as \"Ispravnic\" in Neamț County. In 1800, under Prince Constantine Ypsilantis, Beldiman was appointed \"Pârcălab\" of Galați. Following his father's death, he became sole owner of several estates. One was Cornești, outside Iași; two others, Iezereni and Tețcureni, were in Bessarabia. Beldiman was married three times. His first wife, name unknown, was a member of the Romano clan; the second was Ileana, sister of the Logothete and poet Costache Conachi, making him in-laws with Nicolae Vogoride, future \"Kaymakam\" of Moldavia. Beldiman's final, childless, marriage was to Elena Greceanu.\n\nResearcher Nicolae N. Condeescu pushes the beginnings of Beldiman's literary activity into the 18th century, citing him as the uncredited translator of Vincent Voiture's novel, \"Alcidales et Zelide\". In or around 1799, he also probably completed a version of Eustathios Makrembolites and Godard de Beauchamps' \"Story of Hysmine and Hysminias\". In parallel, Beldiman became identified as one of the earliest contributors to the popularization of Western theater. The beginnings of Moldavian own theatrical activity are dated to ca. 1800, when Conachi, Nicolae Dimachi and Dumitrache Beldiman produced a short series of puppet shows, with Romanian-language texts. They also wrote a comedy of their own, making Dumitrache's one of Moldavia's first playwrights. Another play, tentatively dated to 1811, was called \"Serdarul din Orhei\" (\"The \"Serdar\" of Orhei\"); historian Nicolae Iorga believes that it was penned by Alecu Beldiman.\n\nDumitrache and Alecu remained interested in both literature and politics; Filip withdrew to a monastery in 1792, while Iancu died later that same decade. According to philologist Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, Alecu Beldiman's next translation was from Homer's \"Odyssey\" (as \"Odiseia lui Omir\"). Andreas Wolf, a Transylvanian Saxon physician, met the Beldimans ca. 1797, praising them as lovers of arts and literature. Bogdan-Duică hypothesizes that Beldiman handed his manuscript to Wolf, who took it to Hermannstadt and promised to publish it there. It shows the author's familiarity with, and reliance on, the French-style Romanization of Greek, but is above all infused with staples of the Moldavian dialect. Another similar text, tentatively attributed to Beldiman, showed up at Dorohoi, near Moldavia's border with the Duchy of Bukovina.\n\nAn unclear tradition claims that one of the Belidimans was involved in a project to unite Wallachia and Moldavia as a single \"republic\", with help from Napoleon Bonaparte. Following the Russian invasion of Moldavia in 1806, the youngest Beldiman brother interrupted his literary activities to serve in the occupation government. Alecu's own literary output became more notable following the Russo-Turkish War and the peace of Bucharest. Both Alecu Beldiman and Conachi had been chased out of their Bessarabian estates by the Russian occupation, which ultimately annexed the region as a Bessarabian Governorate; they settled in Iași as refugees. In 1815, Prince Scarlat Callimachi appointed Alecu an \"Aga\" of his citadel in Hârlău. At around that time, he also became involved in the thriving business of inn-keeping, establishing his own taproom in Bârlad. Beldiman was advanced to \"Postelnic\" in 1818, and finally became the \"Ispravnic\" of Iași in 1819, under Prince Michael Soutzos. An 1819 map by Giuseppe Bayardi shows that he owned a mansion on Iași's Sârbească Street. His estate grew to include parts of Popeni and Vinderei, in Tutova County, as well as several other townhouses in Iași. He also owned several hamlets populated by Romanies, which he kept as boyar slaves.\nAt this new stage, Beldiman blended Romanian nationalism with an interest in modern education, declaring himself a direct contributor to the \"material progress of the Romanian people\". According to historian Neagu Djuvara, Beldiman closely resembles the Wallachian intellectuals of his era, specifically Naum Râmniceanu, Dionisie Eclesiarhul, and Zilot Românul, in being virulently anti-Greek and anti-Phanariote. Scholar Pompiliu Eliade sees the Beldimans and the Sturdzas as affiliates of the \"National Party\", which favored independence from the Ottomans and sought direct protection from the French Republic. However, Iorga also highlights the limits of Beldiman's nationalism: although he opted to stay in \"Turkish Moldavia\", he \"never wrote as much as a verse, as much as a single line of prose\" against Russian occupation in Bessarabia. Likewise, scholar Ovid Densusianu reads Beldiman as a Moldavian particularist, who was generally indifferent to the tribulations of Romanians in Wallachia and elsewhere.\n\nPhilologist Andreea Giorgiana Marcu notes that, as a translator of Western literature, Beldiman was necessarily a participant in the Age of Enlightenment. He resonated most with Neoclassicism, and especially with its \"obviously moralizing\" accounts. Likewise, culture critic George Panu proposes that Beldiman and Conachi must have been closely familiarized with, and imitators of, Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna. Over 40 years, Beldiman arguably became the most prolific among Moldavia's contributors to Westernizing translations. As noted by Densusianu, Beldiman translated plays that were never intended for actual stage production, since there was no Moldavian theater to speak of. His texts had to introduce theatrical terminology for which there was yet no equivalent: he proposed \"obraz\" (\"cheek\" or \"face\") for \"character\", and \"schini\" for \"scene\". However, Eliade proposes that Beldiman was directly inspired to write for the stage by witnessing Moldavia's first first-ever theatrical experiment, produced in December 1816 by Gheorghe Asachi.\n\nBy late 1817, Beldiman had completed his own version of Voltaire's \"Oreste\", which was only published in 1820. He soon signed contracts with the Wallachian publisher, Zaharia Carcalechi, who was active in the literary circles of Habsburg Hungary. In 1818, Beldiman also put out \"Învățătură sau povățuire pentru facerea pâinii\" (\"A Guide or Advisor to Bread-making\"), ultimately based on a text by Christian Albert Rückert, but directly translated from the Greek version penned by Dimitrios Samurkasis (Dimitrie Samurcaș). Also that year, Beldiman completed a translation of Salomon Gessner's \"Der Tod Abels\", from the French intermediary. It was published at Buda as \"Moartea lui Avel\".\n\nBeldiman followed up in 1820 with \"Istoria lui Numa Pompilie\". This was a translation of Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian's \"Numa Pompilius\", though Beldiman suppressed any mention of the real author. Its preface includes some of the earliest Romanian views on traductology: Beldiman complained about his struggles in adapting early modern Romanian to render complex phrases in French. As noted by linguist Gheorghe Ivănescu, Beldiman followed Iacob Stamati and other Moldavians in adopting a Wallachian spelling for some of his core vocabulary. \"Istoria\" consistently used \"giudecată\" (; \"trial\" or \"judgement\") for the Moldavianized \"judecată\" ([ʒudekatə]).\n\nBeldiman completed numerous other translations, without ever submitting them for print. Various scribes copied them by hand, and they enjoyed popularity in boyar circles. However, Beldiman discovered that the texts were being slowly altered in the process, and decided to create his own authorized copies. This process involved several younger scribes. One was Ioniță Sion, who took dictation from Beldiman in writing \"all sorts of verse and stories\"; he was not paid for the job, but was allowed to make and keep his own copies. By 1813, Matei Gane of Ciumulești had already collected and transcribed by hand Beldiman's various works. Beldiman penned, but never printed, other renditions of tragedies and stories by Antoine François Prévost (with \"Manon Lescaut\"), Madame Cottin, Pietro Metastasio, René-Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt, Jean-François Regnard, Louis d'Ussieux, and various unknown authors. Reportedly, he also finished translated the \"Iliad\", but this work, if it ever existed, remains lost.\n\nThe final stage of Beldiman's literary and political career was marked by the Greek War of Independence, part of which was fought on Moldavian soil. In early 1821, the country was invaded by Alexander Ypsilantis' Greek forces, comprising the Filiki Eteria and the Sacred Band. This occupation forced Beldiman out of Moldavia, and back into Bessarabia. The events, which culminated in an Ottoman incursion and a Greek defeat in the Battle of Dragashani, were narrated by Beldiman in his rhyming chronicle. It is most often called \"Tragodiea Moldovei\" (\"Moldavia's Tragedy\"), but is also known as \"Eterie sau jalnicele scene prilejuite în Moldova din resvrătirile grecilor, prin șeful lor Alexandru Ipsilanti venitu din Rusia la anul 1821\" (\"The Eteria or Awful Scenes Occurring in Moldavia Because of the Rebellions by Greeks under Their Leader Alexander Ypsilantis, Who Came in from Russia in 1821\"). According to literary historian George Călinescu, the work was unintentionally \"buffoonish\", reading like a \"humorous rigmarole\". The overall result ran at 4,260 lines of verse which, Călinescu argues, was of an \"old-fashioned type\" and \"monotonous\", similar to later works by Constantin Negruzzi.\nScholar Gheorghe Cardaș views Beldiman as the final Moldavian representative of a \"prolix, untalented\" school of poets, which began in 1681 with the anonymous \"Chronological Poem of the Moldavian Rulers\". Similarly, Densusianu notes that Beldiman demanded from his readers a patience that he never repaid. He was \"not a poet, but only a versifier, and as such one in a string of mediocre writers.\" Moreover, his genre of choice, the \"rhyming chronicle\", was \"unrewarding\" and \"manically\" over-detailed, though he remained overall superior to Zilot, his Wallachian contemporary. According to Eliade, \"Tragodiea\" is a \"long and tedious newspaper article, prosaic as no prose has ever been, amusing only because the author himself realizes that his work is so very difficult, and his ability so very limited.\" Eliade also finds that, being no longer disciplined by foreign grammar (as he was in his translations), Beldiman constructs incoherent phrases. His vocabulary is \"flooded\" with Greek, Ottoman, or Slavonic terms.\n\nAccording to historian Vlad Georgescu, Beldiman was still notable as the most erudite chronicler of his generation. As Călinescu writes, an \"entertaining jolt\" in the epic came wherever Beldiman described his contempt for various of his contemporaries: the \"godless dog\" Vasileios Karavias and the haughty but \"so very cowardly\" Stefan Bogoridi. Complex descriptions remain rare, as Beldiman often dismisses the Eterists and his other adversaries with just one epithet, sometimes bordering on the obscene. One line refers to a \"Lividi Nicolaki, that base and ugly soul\", who, according to Beldiman, had been appointed commander of Moldavia's Romanies by Ypsilantis' government. Researchers are unsure about whether this is a reference to Niccolò Livaditti, a Triestene painter.\n\nOther aspects of the narrative were also polemical, reflecting Beldiman's brand of conservatism. In one episode of his epic, Beldiman sides with the local Turks, whom the Eterist invasion had decimated. Another one of his stanzas lambasts Tudor Vladimirescu, leader of the parallel uprising in Wallachia. As noted by Călinescu, Beldiman and Vladimirescu were both Romanian nationalists, but of different visions; the Moldavian poet described the Wallachian revolutionist as \"deceitful\", prone to demagoguery. Historian A. D. Xenopol also notes that Beldiman was sarcastic in his treatment of the Moldavian republican boyars, whom he called \"Decemviri\".\n\nThe restoration of Ottoman rule was rendered complete by the Eterist defeat at Sculeni in June 1821. Beldiman, having been appointed \"Vornic\", made the return trip to Iași. In November, he purchased the townhouse owned by a fellow boyar, the Wallachian Iordache Filipescu, in Păcurari neighborhood; it was here that he finished writing \"Tragodiea\". His poem-chronicle purposefully refrained from documenting the entirety of Ioan Sturdza's reign, which began in 1822. One stanza circulates the notion that Sturdza was a \"son of Moldavia\", rather than a Phanariote, and expresses his belief that a \"golden century\" would follow. The \"Vornic\" soon returned to championing his version of boyar nationalism: in \"Tragodiea\", he makes explicit references to the \"national interest\". From 1823, Beldiman preserved a copy of what he claimed to be Moldavia's Capitulation to the Ottomans, outlining the ancient rights of its inhabitants. The text expanded on earlier forgeries. Overall, he was more pro-Ottoman than Zilot and other chroniclers, being above all thankful that the Empire had defeated Ypsilantis.\n\nIn reality, Beldiman was at odds with the new regime. As one of the more conservative boyars, he clashed with the monarch. In March 1824, with Dimachi and others, he authored a letter of protest against Prince Sturdza, which was addressed to his overlord, Sultan Mahmud II. During the same year, he was briefly imprisoned for his disobedience. Confined inside Tazlău Monastery, he produced his final set of poems, \"Stihuri\" (\"Verse\"). These are patriotic in tone, but noticeably skeptical of nationalism, explaining that, even though the Phanariotes had lost power, bad customs survived through native boyars; unusually in his context, he sided with the lower classes against the aristocrats. Several lines refer to the harsh conditions faced by travelers, noting that rainstorms had rendered infernal his trip to Tazlău. Stylistically, the \"Stihuri\" resemble both Neoclassicism and early Romantic poetry, introducing elements later found in works by Barbu Paris Mumuleanu.\n\nBeldiman was ultimately released and made a discreet return to politics, living in relative seclusion for the rest of his life. His last published translation came out in 1824. It was a first volume of William Coxe's \"Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark\", taken from a French version by Paul Henri Mallet. He died in January 1826, or at, earliest, December 1825—according to fellow writer Dimitrie Pastiescul, he still held a pen in his hand when this occurred. Buried at his family's favorite church of Talpalari, Beldiman left a large number of manuscripts, which were reportedly sold by the pound to a local collector. Both Dumitrache and Filip survived their brother's death, the former dying in 1831. Filip, better known under his monastic name \"Filaret\", was appointed Bishop of Roman and carateker of the Moldavian Metropolis. In 1842, he served as administrator of Moldavia, filling in for Prince Mihail Sturdza.\n\nFrom his Romano marriage, Alecu had a daughter. Known as either Pulheria or Profira, she married into the Cantacuzino family. She was famous for raising her husband's illegitimate son, the half-Romani Dincă, who was formally her house slave. Her refusal to manumit him, and his subsequent suicide, resulted in mass support for abolitionism. Alecu's son, Vasile Beldiman, married a Mavrocordatos. His only notable public office was that of Caretaker (\"Epitrop\") of Moldavian schools. His wife Elena sold the Beldiman house in Păcurari to boyar Lupu Balș; it changed hands and served various functions until being demolished in 1966.\n\nVasile died in 1853, and was survived by a son, Alexandru Beldiman, who was the head of Romanian Police and close friend of the Principalities' first \"Domnitor\", Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In this capacity, he failed to prevent Cuza's toppling in 1866, and came to oppose the regime of Carol I, founding the left-wing newspaper \"Adevărul\". Cornești, still owned by this branch of the family, was passed to poet Dimitrie Anghel, and later to the Mavrocordatos.\n\nA Iordachi Beldiman, sometimes described as Alecu's son, was in fact one of his nephews, born to Dumitrache Beldiman. Iordachi married Catinca Dimachi, daughter of the writer. She was made famous by her affair with poet Alexandru Hrisoverghi; according to one account, Hrisoverghi died after jumping out a window in Iordachi's townhouse. Also a \"Vornic\", Iordachi was noted for commissioning a gallery of portraits of Moldavian Princes. During the United Principalities era, he became a leading figure in Iași's conservative circles, helping Iacob Negruzzi establish the political review \"Constituțiunea\". Alecu's niece, Maria or Marghioala, was a locally famous philanthropist, married to politician Scarlat Miclescu. Their son, Dimitrie S. Miclescu (1820–1896), participated in the 1848 revolutionary movement, as well as being a published poet. He became a noted agitator on the far-left of Romanian liberalism and renounced all claim to boyar privilege, including his family name.\n\nBeldiman's translations continued to be read by young intellectuals in all Romanian-speaking areas: Constantin N. Brăiloiu, who went abroad to study in 1828, ordered copies of \"Oreste\" and \"Istoria lui Numa Pompilie\", \"so as not to forget his language\". Ioniță Sion's manuscripts were preserved by his son, the poet-memoirist Gheorghe Sion. For decades, \"Tragodiea\" circulated in 23 handwritten copies, two of which were respectively owned by Nicolae Bălcescu and Alexandru Odobescu. In the 1840s, Mihail Kogălniceanu set himself the task of printing Beldiman's writings and documents as part of an anthology. As \"Eterie sau jalnicele scene\", \"Tragodiea\" was eventually printed in 1861, at the expense of an Alecu Balica; it was reissued in 1875 as \"Tragedia Moldovei\".\n\nBy then, poet Vasile Alecsandri was actively campaigning for Beldiman to be included into the Romanian literary canon, while philologist Alexandru Lambrior unsuccessfully proposed to set the Romanian literary standard exclusively on words used by Beldiman and Conachi. Beldiman's work was finally rediscovered in the 1890s. One of its promoters was the antiquarian George Ionescu-Gion, who insisted that Beldiman was without philosophical merit, but a genuine patriot. The same belief was expressed in 1910 by Xenopol, according to whom Beldiman was not significant as a poet, but voiced the \"national sentiment in all its freedom\".\n"}

Her first child, Gemma, died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in 1989 at the age of 13 weeks, although she was never charged in connection with Gemma's death.\n\nHer conviction was based on claims that she had smothered the children, but was overturned as unsafe by the Court of Appeal on 10 December 2003. Cannings was convicted after the involvement in her case of Professor Sir Roy Meadow, a paediatrician who was later struck off, then reinstated, by the General Medical Council.\n\nThe Cannings case was re-examined after a BBC \"Real Story\" investigation showed that her paternal great-grandmother had suffered one sudden infant death and her paternal grandmother two. Professor Michael Patton, a clinical geneticist at St George's Hospital Medical School, told the BBC that a genetic inheritance was the most likely explanation for the crib deaths in the family.\n\nExpert witness Professor Sir Roy Meadow was later struck off the General Medical Council register partly as a result of his evidence at the Cannings trial. Meadow based his calculations on the likelihood of a second cot death being the same as the likelihood of a first, whereas in households where one crib death has taken place, the probability of another is greatly increased. He also asserted cot death implausible (which was contrary to the opinion of other specialists). Cannings later said Meadow should be \"severely punished\" for his testimony in her case and others. Meadow was later reinstated to the GMC on appeal, a judge ruling that his errors did not amount to serious professional misconduct.\n\nThe quashing of Cannings' conviction and other high-profile cases resulted in a review of 297 other cases where conviction relied on expert witness opinion. On 14 February 2006, Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, announced that three of these cases needed to be reconsidered by the courts, but that the majority did not give rise to concern.\n\n\n"}

Five among the \"Ten most wanted\" opposition figures wanted by the military government after the 11 September coup were militants of MIR. Bautista van Schouwen was at the time member of MIR's \"Comisión Política\" and the \"Secretariado\", the highest executive organ of the MIR. The military had set a reward of 500 000 Escudos to anyone who would lead them to the capture of Van Schouwen. He was abducted in Santiago December 13, 1973, in the church \"Parroquia Capuchinos\" (2345 Catedral Street), after having been caught when the priest who was sheltering them, unwittingly let slip to his military cousins, that they were at the church. Father Enrique White was also detained and tortured, later exiled to England. Van Schouwen and his lieutenant Patricio Munita had previously obtained clandestine refuge in the Capuchinos church-premises. They were soon after their capture killed under torture in the Army-managed detention and torture centre of Villa Grimaldi. The assassinations of Van Schouwen and Munita were however concealed by the Pinochet government and the Van Schouwen case during several years labelled as \"desaparecido\" (the \"missing ones\") by Human-rights organizations in Chile (see below Demise whereabouts).\n\nBautista van Schouwen Vasey was the first son of Industrial Chemical Engineer Bautista van Schouwen Figueroa and Carlota María Valentina Vasey Crozier. He had two younger brothers named Carlos and Jorge. The family arrived in the Concepción region in 1953 and established first in a rural property in the nearby La Florida and then in Concepción. During the second half of his high-school studies he met Miguel Enriquez and Marcello Ferrada de Noli. These friends, together with an elder brother of Miguel Enríquez (Marco Antonio) and a new comrade they met at the first year of medical studies at the University of Concepcion (Jorge Gutiérrez Correa) started the secret group Movimiento Socialista Revolucionario in 1962. Other two members joined 1963-1964. The group first entered the socialist cell \"Sierra Maestra\" (also called \"Espartaco\", of the Socialist Party Youth in Concepción) led by Marcello Ferrada de Noli and who have according to their plans established earlier a \"pie de terre\" in the Socialist Party 1961. In fact, the group was from the beginning a fraction within the Socialist Party in Concepción. Historians have referred that this political group developed around their publication \"Revolution\" which first issue appeared in 1963.\n\nBautista van Schouwen Vasey married in the summer of 1968 to Inés Enríquez Espinosa, an English literature graduate and the only sister of Miguel Enríquez Espinosa, the best man of their wedding was their other old-time friend Marcello Ferrada de Noli. Bautista van Schouwen Vasey and Inés Enríquez Espinosa had one child named Pablo.\n\nIn October 1965 Bautista van Schouwen Vasey participated in the foundation of the MIR in Santiago and was elected at that opportunity member of MIR's Central Committee. Two years after was elected chairman of MIR's Regional Committee for Concepción, the largest in the MIR, nationwide. In 1966 he was President of the Medical Student Union of the University of Concepción and led with Nelson Gutierrez (President of the Sociology Students Union), Marcello Ferrada de Noli (President of the Philosophy Students Union) and Luis Moreno (President of the Engineer Students Union) a long, and at times bloody, struggle for a university reform at the conservative University of Concepción. Together with medical student Luciano Cruz (another notorious MIR leader, died 1971) and other students of prominent participation in such struggle – mainly from the \"Movimiento Universitario de Izquierda, MUI\" - they finally succeeded in 1968 obtaining a university reform which became model for the student movement in the country elsewhere. Years 1968-1969 the student-movement in Chile had scored notable victories but at the same time increased a confrontation with the authorities both at the universities and government. It was at that time when Bautista Van Schouwen Vasey and Miguel Enríquez Espinosa published the document \"De las luchas estudiantiles a las filas de la Revolución\" (\"From the students' struggles to the ranks of the Revolution\").\n\nIn 1969 the Christian Democratic government of Eduardo Frei declared MIR out-law and many MIR cadres had to pass to clandestine life. The government implemented a nationwide persecution of the thirteen most known leaders of the organization at that epoch (among those wanted were Miguel Enríquez, Luciano Cruz, Bautista Van Schouwen, Nelson Gutierrez, Marcello Ferrada de Noli, Anibal Matamala, Jose Bordas, José Goñi, Juan Saavedra Gorriategy, and others). Bautista Van Schouwen was however never captured. The cause against the MIR was eventually dismissed the year after by the new government of Salvador Allende through an amnesty decree. By then Bautista Van Schouwen had moved to Santiago and had taken the political leadership and the editor-in-chief post of \"El Rebelde\", MIR's official newspaper.\n\nBautista van Schouwen Vasey graduated in 1968 from medical school with the second best marks of his promotion and he took afterwards an internship and postdoctoral training in neurology. He left those activities shortly thereafter for full-time dedication to the political and military activities of MIR, in preparation to resist the imminent 1973 Chilean coup d'état against the Salvador Allende government which finally took place on the 11th of September, 1973. Some time before in 1972 Bautista Van Schouwen Vasey was married for the second time to Astrid Heitmman, a registered nurse at the university hospital.\n\nThe ideological stands among the early generation of youngsters from Concepción that founded MIR in 1965 correspond to a variety of political ideologies ranging from Social-liberalism to Marxist and Trotskyite positions. Although official declarations of the epoch, MIR had not a truly uniform ideological stand until the Congress of 1967 (see Movement of the Revolutionary Left) in which prevailed the Leninists positions represented by the new elected General Secretary Miguel Enriquez. Bautista Van Schouwen did follow his friend Miguel Enríquez in this regard. However, it has been put forward that van Schouwen would have been a closer follower to the doctrine of Rosa Luxemburg, favouring general strikes over cadre-organization political work as in Leninists traditions. Other authors of the epoch have placed Van Schouwen's earlier ideological positions in the line of socialist humanism and also sympathetic with social-anarchist positions. Contrary to what \"official\" versions have maintained, historians have established – based in interview testimonies of Marco Antonio Enríquez, a History Professor at Sorbonne ( also referred above as elder brother of Miguel Enríquez) - that Bautista Van Schouwen did not participate in the elaboration of the first historical document in the foundation of MIR, The \"Insurrectional Thesis\". Bautista Van Schouwen was nevertheless a prolific writer of political documents and he was trusted by his peers the political and ideological leadership of MIR's official newspaper \"El Rebelde\". The last known MIR-document in which Bautista Van Schouwen had personally participated was the situation-analysis of December 1973 authored by the \"Secretariado\" of MIR (the MIR executive committee, led by Miguel Enríquez).\n\nBautista Van Schouwen was killed under captivity by DINA late at night December 13, 1973 with a bullet on the head; later abandoned under a tree, at a cross-road in the proximities of Villa Grimaldi, and again his body perforated from the back with multiple bullets from machine-gun fire. Another military patrol discovered later the corpses of Munita and Van Schouwen (with no identifications) and – unaware of the above facts – took them routinely to the Forensic station in Santiago. There was an autopsy performed, and the victim's identities were also established, which was routinely reported thereafter to the police. When this report reached DINA their operatives confiscated the corpses and ordered a secret burial, at night, in Patio 29 at the \"Cementerio General\" of Santiago. On the 16 February 1974, again in a secret operation – this time presumably under the direct orders of Augusto Pinochet to General Ernesto Baeza, the Interior Minister - DINA arranged the exhumation and incineration of Bautista Van Schouwen's remains. The secret killing of Bautista Van Schouwen had remarkable consequences.\n\nThe MIR let it be known for many years that Van Schouwen was instead alive, under captivity by the military, but heavily wounded due to torture. MIR even published a picture of Van Schouwen depicting him with bandages supposedly imprisoned in a military medical compound. On the other hand, the military have given contradictory information to the public; first the interior ministry informed, and echoed by the press (17 August 1974) that Bautista Van Schouwen had been captured on December 13, 1973, and that he was \"in custody at an undisclosed location\". Later that year the military retracted the information on that Van Schouwen was in custody in Chile and affirmed instead that he had \"escaped to Cuba on the 2nd of February\" 1974. Nevertheless, Amnesty International informed in their first report about the human-rights violations by the Chilean Junta that Van Schouwen was held prisoner and had been transported to a variety of detention sites by the military. The Chilean human-rights organizations, for their part, for years went on demanding clarity on the \"disappearance\" of Bautista Van Schouwen and his case was included in a variety of judicial processes that ensued around the missing ones in Chile (those whose whereabouts were unknown). As late as 1998 his friend and MIR co-founder Marcello Ferrada de Noli, then a university professor in Norway, filled in European courts a criminal case against Augusto Pinochet for the assassination or disappearance of Bautista Van Schouwen and Edgardo Enriquez. Pinochet was then under house arrest in London but was ultimately granted by the British government returning to Chile without processes in Europe.\n\nIn 2007 an Appeal Court in Santiago de Chile processed the former DINA commander, Army General (R) Marcelo Moren Brito, for the criminal killing of Bautista Van Schouwen and his lieutenant Patricio Munita.\n\nIn 2013 Bautista's son Pablo began legal proceedings against the Chilean state in a civil action. The court hearing with full witness testimonies began on January 31, 2017 in Santiago.\n"}
{"id": "53636409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53636409", "title": "Bendy and the Ink Machine", "text": "Bendy and the Ink Machine\n\nBendy and the Ink Machine (often abbreviated to BATIM) is an episodic survival horror video game developed and published by theMeatly Games, Ltd. It was initially released to Game Jolt on February 10, 2017, as the first of five chapters (excluding the bonus chapter), with a full release on October 27, 2018. A console port published by Rooster Teeth Games was released on November 20, 2018, exclusively through GameStop.\n\nThe game follows Henry Stein, a retired animator who returns to his old studio after an invitation from his old employer and discovers a nightmare of cartoon characters seemingly brought to life by the titular Ink Machine.\n\n\"Bendy and the Ink Machine\" was well received upon its initial release, with praise centering on its vintage aesthetic and story. In the months following its release, it quickly gained a cult following from exposure on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, and eventually was approved through Steam Greenlight in mid-2017. Merchandise, as well as a mobile spinoff, was later introduced to further promote the game. Mike Mood, the game's programmer and co-creator, described the game as an \"accidental success\".\n\n\"Bendy and the Ink Machine\" is a survival horror game that uses a mixture of puzzle solving, environment exploration and combat to aid Henry on his journey through Joey Drew Studios. Players explore through a first-person view and have limited physical actions such as running and jumping. Different items can be collected, some of which are required to perform various tasks before proceeding. Cans of bacon soup, a reference to the game's creator theMeatly and his partner Mike Mood, can also be collected for both achievements and to restore Henry's health if he is injured.\n\nCombat is primarily focused around a variety of different melee-based weapons, such as an axe or a pipe. In-game enemies all have different strength levels and resilience to damage, forcing players to be tactical about keeping out of reach and striking when necessary. Henry can retreat inside Little Miracle Stations whenever enemies are nearby in order to recover or remain out of sight. If he takes too much damage, he can escape from the ink that consumes him and respawn at one of the numerous statues of Bendy that act as checkpoints.\n\nIn addition, players can find numerous audio logs throughout the studio that give more details about the game's story, particularly concerning about the fate of the studio and its employees, similar to the systems used in games such as \"BioShock\". Some of these logs can be missed and require further exploration to uncover the secret areas they often reside in. \n\nHenry Stein returns to his old animation studio, \"Joey Drew Studios\", after receiving an invitation from his old employer Joey Drew to be shown something important, finding the titular Ink Machine. During the attempt to repair and turn it on, he uncovers old tape recordings that imply that Joey was taking part in bizarre occult practices while making the Machine. After completing the steps to fix it, Henry is suddenly attacked by an monster who resembles the studio's mascot Bendy. Henry tries to escape as the workshop floods with ink. When he reaches the EXIT door the floor beneath him collapses, sending him into the depths below, flooded with ink. After draining the Ink and finding an axe, he then passes out in a room with a pentagram. Henry wakes up, then he explores the studio for a way out, encountering hostile ink monsters. He learns that Sammy Lawrence, the musical director for the studio, started to worship Bendy as a deity after the Machine's installation. After draining a stairwell to escape, Henry is knocked out from behind by the now-insane Sammy. Hoping that his \"Lord\" will restore his humanity, Sammy plots to sacrifice Henry to Bendy as an offering, but the ritual fails when Sammy is attacked and apparently killed by Bendy. Henry flees and encounters a living version of Boris the Wolf, and the pair escape to a safe house. \n\nDeciding to try to find a way out, the pair enter the studio's toy department where they encounter another ink creature who resembles the character Alice Angel, implied to be made from the character's actress, Susie Campbell. Henry follows Alice down to her lair where she explains she has been harvesting the body parts of other ink monsters to improve her deformed appearance, offering him his freedom in exchange for a few 'favours'. During these tasks, Henry frequently encounters \"Bendy\" wandering the halls, corrupted versions of the Butcher Gang characters, and another creature called the Projectionist, implied to be created from the studio's projectionist Norman Polk. When every task is complete, Henry and Boris are allowed to ascend in an elevator to escape, but Alice proclaims she wants to use Boris to fix herself and makes it crash. As Boris tries to wake Henry, he is suddenly pulled away by Alice into the darkness. Henry climbs out of the remains of the crashed elevator to search for Boris, passing through the studio's archives and discovering a gathering of more ink creatures named the Lost Ones, implied to be some of the studio's former employees desperate to go home. Henry eventually finds himself in a large underground warehouse that houses prototypes for a Bendy theme park, \"Bendy Land\", created by park designer Bertrum Piedmont. He begins restoring power to the warehouse to access the haunted house where Boris is being kept, encountering a monstrous version of Bertrum encased within an amusement attraction in the process. He also crosses paths with the Projectionist again but Bendy appears and kills the creature, appearing to save him. Eventually getting inside the haunted house, Henry discovers Boris is now a hulking monster thanks to Alice, and is forced to kill him. An enraged Alice tries to kill Henry herself, only to be run through by a sword from behind belonging to a second Alice Angel and another clone of Boris with a mechanical arm. \n\nAllison and Tom, the Alice and Boris clones, lock Henry in their hideout, unsure of what he is. After some time in captivity, Henry gains their trust enough to be given the Seeing Tool, a looking glass that can reveals hidden messages left behind by someone else trying to escape the studio. After Bendy discovers the hideout, Henry escapes and uses a paddle-boat to cross a river of ink, finding a town made by the ink creatures. Sammy, having survived his encounter with Bendy, attacks Henry in a rage but is killed by Tom. After fighting off Sammy's followers with Allison and Tom, Henry is separated from them after falling into the studio's administration offices. With more hidden messages telling him to get something inside the studio's Film Vault, Henry discovers more audio logs that tell the truth about the studio's downfall. It it revealed that Joey ordered the Machine's construction after the studio began to run into financial difficulty with the declining sales of the Bendy cartoons, creating it from equal parts of engineering and magic. The hope was to run the studio's cartoon film reels through the Machine in order to create real-life cartoon attractions that people could interact with. The first attempt at doing this resulted in \"Bendy\", rejected as an abomination because of his lack of a soul, after which Joey decided to use the souls of his employees to create better attractions, resulting in the ink creatures and the studio's bankruptcy.\n\nHenry opens up the Vault after reuniting with Allison and Tom, where another hidden message reveals that \"Bendy\" has taken something from it. Henry decides to venture into \"Bendy's\" lair, the Ink Machine itself, to recover the item, where he finds a tape left behind by Joey. The studio owner explains the only thing that can truly defeat \"Bendy\" is \"The End\", a reel of film and the object stolen by the creature, who suddenly appears and transforms into an enormous ink beast to stop Henry from playing it. Evading the demon's attacks, Henry is able to insert \"The End\" into a projector where \"Beast Bendy\" is forced to watch it and disintegrates. The game then suddenly switches from the studio to the inside of a home (implied to be a flashback that takes place before the game itself), covered in letters and sketches related to characters and events from earlier in the game. Henry goes to the kitchen, where he finds an elderly Joey waiting to talk to him. As the old studio owner talks of how they took two different paths to get to this point, Joey tells Henry that he should visit the old workshop as he has something to show him. When Henry opens the door, he finds himself entering the studio at the beginning of the game, repeating his opening lines.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the camera focuses on an image of Bendy, Boris, and Alice by Henry who gifted it to Joey for the success of the characters. With the sight of a rusted Ink Machine in the corner, a young girl's voice asks \"Uncle Joey\" to tell her another story. This implies that the entire game is actually a story that Joey is telling to his niece.\n\nThe playable character and protagonist is Henry Stein (theMeatly), a former animator of Joey Drew Studios, who returns to the studio thirty years after resigning from the company. The game is played through a first-person narrative.\n\nJoey Drew (David Eddings), the CEO of the studio, invites Henry back to the studio. He introduced the Ink Machine to the studio, exhibiting peculiar behavior around it. Joey is described as a \"man of ideas, but nothing else\" by Henry. Other characters view him as an unethical employer and demanding perfectionist, uncaring towards the working conditions of his colleagues. Though acting like an eccentric dreamer, Chapter 4 proves this is just a ruse via a recording, Joey is actually portrayed as a cynical, greedy individual only concerned with his own success by drawing people in with his false promise of fulfilling their dreams. TheMeatly described Joey's greatest and worst flaw as his \"unending desire to make the impossible possible.\"\n\nOther members of the studio's staff are introduced via audio recordings. These include Wally Franks (theMeatly), the studio janitor; Thomas Connor (Mike Mood), a repairman who built the Ink Machine; Sammy Lawrence (Aaron Landon), the musical director, who serves as an antagonist in Chapter 2, worshipping Bendy as a deity and returning in Chapter 5; Jack Fain (Bookpast), a lyricist, turned into a \"swollen\" Searcher in the remastered Chapter 2; projector operator Norman Polk (theMeatly), transformed into a monster called the \"Projectionist\", appearing in Chapters 3 and 4, a character that was almost left out of the final version of the third chapter due to time restraints; accountant Grant Cohen (Will Ryan); Shawn Flynn (Seán McLoughlin), an Irish toy designer; Bertrum Piedmont (Joe J. Thomas), a theme park architect, who appears as a boss in Chapter 4; engineer Lacie Benton (Lani Minella); and the voice actresses of the character Alice Angel, Susie Campbell (Alanna Linayre), and her replacement Allison Pendle (Lauren Synger).\n\nSusie plays a major antagonistic role in Chapters 3 and 4, appearing as a malevolent, deformed version of the character Alice Angel. Through audio recordings, Susie is revealed to have been unceremoniously replaced with Allison as Alice's voice actress, causing her to blame Joey for deceiving her. Susie kills numerous cartoon characters and harvests their innards to become a \"perfect\" incarnation of herself, and specifically targets Boris the Wolf. Allison appears in Chapter 4 and 5 as a heroic version of Alice, referred to as \"Allison Angel\".\n\nThroughout the game, Henry encounters numerous staff members, transformed into monsters made from ink, or resembling the studio's animated characters. A number of these appear in Chapter 4, referred to as the \"Lost Ones\", but show no hostility towards the player, though turn antagonistic in Chapter 5 after Sammy's death. The stock enemy in the game are the \"Searchers\", though other variants appear in boss battles.\n\nThe studio has created several in-universe cartoon characters who starred in silent animated shorts. The titular character is Bendy the Dancing Demon, the studio mascot, who appears as a recurring antagonist towards Henry throughout the game. Bendy's name was in fact a typo, created when the 3D modeling program, Blender, saved the character's model with the name. The fifth chapter revealed the antagonistic Bendy was a soulless, experimental creation of the Ink Machine to create real cartoon characters, and is the only incarnation of Bendy born from the machine.\n\nBoris appears as several individual characters in the game. In Chapter 2, the player meets a benevolent version of Boris, who accompanies Henry throughout Chapter 3. Several other copies of Boris are found dead in the first and third chapters, used by Susie to achieve her \"perfection\". She captures Boris at the end of the third chapter, reintroducing him in a new, monstrous and aggressive form in Chapter 4, forcing the player to battle him in a boss fight. Another mechanized Boris appears at the end of Chapter 4 and in Chapter 5, named \"Tom\", accompanying Allison, implied to be Thomas Connor. The aforementioned Alice Angel debuts in Chapter 2, who theMeatly describes as \"quite the gal\". Chapter 3 introduced the Butcher Gang, a trio of characters who act as antagonists to Bendy in his cartoon shorts - Charley, an unidentified humanoid; Barley, a sailor; and Edgar, a spider. They appear as antagonists in Chapters 3 onwards as mutilated versions of themselves, named \"Piper\", \"Fisher\" and \"Striker\", respectively.\non\n\nOfficial videos for a series of animated shorts based on \"Bendy and the Ink Machine\" have been released from theMeatly's YouTube channel, with animation done by animator Timethehobo. The first animated short, \"Tombstone Picnic\", was released as part of the Chapter Three reveal trailer on August 11, 2017. The second short, \"Haunted Hijinx\", was uploaded on October 31, 2017, to celebrate Halloween. The third short, \"Snow Sillies\", was uploaded on December 24, 2017, in celebration of the holiday season.\n\nA Halloween crossover mod, \"Hello Bendy\", was released for the game on October 27, 2017, for a limited time, featuring the \"Hello Neighbor\" antagonist who takes the role as Bendy in all previous three chapters and even Sammy Lawrence for \"Chapter 2\". The mod's menu features the advertisement of pre-ordering the game \"Hello Neighbor\". The mod expired by the end of October that year.\n\nCo-creator Mike Mood has talked about wanting to do a crossover with run and gun platformer \"Cuphead\", which also uses rubber hose animation.\n\nA mobile spin-off, titled \"Bendy in Nightmare Run!\", was announced on January 26, 2018 and was released on Android and iOS on August 15, 2018.\nDeveloped by Karman Interactive in partnership with theMeatly Games, Ltd. and PhatMojo, the game introduces the cartoon Bendy and his co-stars in an endless running-style game, featuring four levels with a different \"boss\" cartoon monster, as well as collectible items and power-ups, including bacon soup cans that act as currency to buy abilities and upgrades, and possible future updates.\n"}

Their \"Pattole Palame\" was written using the Kannada script originally. It has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa and has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi.\n\nBoverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa are the grandchildren of Nadikerianda Chinnappa, the compiler of the Pattole Palame. The translators’ introduction explains: \"Since the Kodava language does not have a script, he used the Kannada script that has been in vogue since the 17th century, when the Lingayat Rajas ruled Kodagu and Kannada was their court language.\" Nadikerianda Chinnappa had begun translating the work into English in 1925 but he died in 1931, before he could complete it.\n\nChinnappa's daughter Gangamma married Muthanna who was an engineer and from the Boverianda clan. Chinnappa's son and daughter-in-law were both teachers. Their daughter Nanjamma was married to her cross-cousin, the son of Gangamma (Chinnappa's daughter), who had also been named Chinnappa. Boverianda Chinnappa, an engineer with a degree from an Illinois university, and Nanjamma, a statistician who did her early schooling in Udupi and Mangalore, obtained her master's degree in statistics from Madras University in 1954 and did her post-graduate studies in the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. They both pursued their professions at Chennai, Kolkata and Canada. Nanjamma was a visiting fellow at Cambridge University in 1974. She has also co-authored a book on Business Survey Methods.\nIn 1993 she was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.\nIn 2006 she was given an honorary doctorate degree (D. Litt.) of the Mangalore University by T. N. Chaturvedi, the Governor of Karnataka.\n\nIn the 1970s, Boverianda Chinnappa, Nanjamma's mother and Nanjamma began to copy out the \"Pattole Palome\" in longhand over almost three years. While they were searching for copies of the original edition of the Pattole Palame, a ninety-year-old farmer and self-taught folk artist, Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, responded to their advertisement. During his youth, unable to afford the book, he had copied out the entire text word by word under a kerosene lamp. This hardcover book he gifted to the Chinnappas. Nanjamma's parents assisted in translating and interpreting the text. In the second edition of \"Pattole Palame\" (or 'Silken Lore'), published by the University of Mysore in 1975, the editor describes it as one of the earliest extensive collections of folklore from any Indian community.\n\nAfter retirement the couple settled down in Bangalore in 1995 and began to realise their grandfather's cherished dream. Finally in 2003, they completed the work and it has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi. That same year it was released in Madikeri (Mercara). This book has become the chief text for the Coorgs.\n\nBoverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa have chalked out at least ten Kodagu-based projects for the future, including a directory of aine mane or ancestral homes, a lexicon of the Kodava language and a biography of the late Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, a self-taught folk artist. Presently they have been working on the ainemane project, this can be found on the Ainmanes website.\n\nBoverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa had undertaken a project to collect information regarding each and every Ainmane found in Kodagu, irrespective of the community or caste of the clan members residing in them. They visited many of them in the period between April 2003 and May 2008. They also collected oral legends and traditional information from the occupants of each of these functional Ainemanes. The information was collected from members of the okka present in the ainmané during the visits and from those contacted later by telephone. Along with this they have researched about the concerned clans from previously published written material, wherever possible. The stories collected from the informants are oral narratives. The information thus collected are now available on the Ainmanes website. They have also provided a glossary for the Kodava thakk words used in the site. The couple are currently working on a book \"Ainmanés of Koḍagu\" that will give an overview of the ancestral homes of Koḍagu and of their socio-cultural significance.\n\nThe objective of this web-site is to document the current status of the traditional ainmanés of all the communities in Koḍagu and thereby contribute to the archival records of the heritage and oral history of the people of Koḍagu. It provides insights into the social and religious customs and conventions of the communities in Kodagu and the way of life of the people. It will also serve to raise awareness of the value of these buildings and the need to preserve them, besides providing information for those studying the socio-cultural-architectural heritage of Kodagu. This web-site contains information on all the traditional ainmanés in Koḍagu that were functional when the Chinnappas visited them. It includes photographs and information on each ainmané and its okka.\nEvery ainmané in the web-site is identified by its mané péda, the village where it is located and the community to which it belongs. Entering the mané péda of the okka in the ‘Search window’ allows the user to retrieve the photos and information on the ainmané and the okka. A table listing the okkas visited in alphabetical order of their mané pédas along with the names of the villages where their ainmanés are located and the communities that the okkas belong to is provided. Similar tables in alphabetical order of village names and by community are also provided. Also included are sketch maps of Kodagu (in 9 sections) that show the location of each ainmané. The ainmanés are identified by numbers on the maps, and the index gives their mané pédas. A glossary gives the meanings of words in Koḍava language that are in the web-site. Accent marks in the glossary and the key to the transliteration provides a guide to the reader on the correct pronunciation of these words.\n\nIn 2014, Niyogi books has published their work titled \"Ainmanes of Kodagu\".\n\n"}

From 2000 to 2012, he represented Senate District 21. In 2012, the reconfigured district incorporated mostly Republican portions of Iberia, Lafourche, St. Mary, and Lafourche parishes.\n\nGautreaux won his last election to the Senate in 2007, when he defeated the Republican Clayton D. Diaz, 25,348 (71 percent) to 10,372 (29 percent). At that time the district also included two precincts in St. Martin Parish, since removed from the reconfiguration.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000, Gautreaux was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 51 but vacated the post after the single term to run for the Senate. In the 1995 general election, Gautreaux defeated the Democrat-turned-Republican Joe Harrison, 8,457 votes (69 percent) to 3,809 ballots (31 percent). Harrison was subsequently elected in 2007 to House District 51 and still holds the seat.\n\nGautreaux attended Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. He served from 1967 to 1972 in the United States Navy. He is active in Rotary International, having been secretary of the Morgan City chapter. Gautreaux has served as vice president of marketing for Marsianin Industrial Contractors LLC in Morgan City and administrator for Arabie Trucking Services LLC in Thibodaux.\n\nGautreaux sought the lieutenant governorship of Louisiana in a 2010 special election occasioned by the resignation of incumbent Mitch Landrieu when Landrieu became mayor of New Orleans.

After Jan Hus had been burned at the stake in Constance (1415), he joined the Hussite movement. At first, he was a leader of the more radical Hussites and a comrade of Jan Žižka; later he became more moderate and even fought against the Taborites.\n\nIn 1420, Diviš and priest Ambrož Hradecký conquered Hradec Králové, the most important city in eastern Bohemia. It allowed him in following year to conquer and loot nearby Benedictine monastery at Opatovice nad Labem and subsequently the very same fate prepared for the Cistercian Sezemice Convent. He confiscated their properties which made him suddenly a rich man. In 1423, he founded a small castle on the hill Kunětická Hora (82 m above ground), near the town Pardubice; this castle he named Kunětice Mountain Castle.\n\nIn June and July 1423 he and captain Bedřich of Strážnice led a campaign to Moravia, in which they defeated the armies of Jan XII. Železný (\"the Iron\"), Bishop of Olomouc and the Duke Přemek of Opava. After its return to Bohemia, the Hussite armies were attacked near Hradec Králové by the armies of Jan Žižka, whom they had regarded as fellow Hussites. Jan Žižka defeated them and took the abundant prey they had conquered in Moravia.\n\nIn subsequent years, he led campaigns of conquest to eastern Bohemia and became a captain in the towns Pardubice and Litomyšl. In 1427 he supported as a captain of Kolín the moderate Utraquists and hosted the delegation, who at this meeting decided the attack Prague. This plan was betrayed and the army was massacred. In return, Prokop the Great led his army to Kolín and besieged it. Diviš could keep up the defense of the city for three months, until town's paupers, which sympathized with the radical Hussites, forced him to surrender. Diviš agreed with the besiegers on the surrender of the town in return for free passage.\n\nIn later years he was one of the leaders of the moderate Hussites and stood in the forefront of the combined armies of the Utraquists and the Catholics loyal to King Sigismund of Luxembourg. This coalition defeated in the decisive Battle of Lipany (30 May 1434) joined armies of the Sirotci (Orphans) and Taborites which meant the definitive end of the Hussite Wars.\n\nHis participation in the Hussite Wars brought him a large fortune. As a reward for his loyal service, he was finally enfeoffed with the lands of Kunětická Hora and other areas. In 1436 he also bought Pardubice, one year later obtained from the king town Přelouč with surrounding villages as a pawn. He died as one of the richest man in eastern Bohemia. His inheritance was divided among his sons; unfortunately, they lost those possessions just as quickly.\n"}

He was the evangelist of Ergyng () (later Archenfield) and much of southeast Wales.\n\nThe earliest documentation of Dubricius is from around 1133, recording the translation of his relics, and is to be found (in the form of \"Lectiones\") in the \"Book of Llandaff\" (\"Liber Landavensis\"). It may contain some genuine traditions, but as it appeared at least five hundred years after his death, it cannot claim to be historical.\n\nDubricius was the illegitimate son of Efrddyl, the daughter of King Peibio Clafrog of Ergyng. His grandfather threw his mother into the River Wye when he discovered she was pregnant, but was unsuccessful in drowning her. Dubricius was born in Madley in Herefordshire, England. He and his mother were reconciled with Peibio when the child Dubricius touched him and cured him of his leprosy.\n\nNoted for his precocious intellect, by the time he attained manhood he was already known as a scholar throughout Britain. Dubricius founded a monastery at Hentland and then one at Moccas. He became the teacher of many well-known Welsh saints, including Teilo and Samson and also healed the sick of various disorders through the laying on of hands. Dedications at Porlock and near Luscombe on the Exmoor coast of Somerset may indicate that he also travelled in that area. He later became Bishop of Ergyng, possibly with his seat at Weston under Penyard, and probably held sway over all of Glamorgan and Gwent, an area that was later known as the diocese of Llandaff. However, he may have merely been a bishop for the purpose of ordaining priests, not as administrative head of the church over a geographical area. Dubricius was good friends with Saints Illtud and Samson, and attended the Synod of Llanddewi Brefi in 545, where he is said to have resigned his see in favour of Saint David. He retired to Bardsey Island where he was eventually buried before his body was transferred to Llandaff Cathedral in 1120.\n\nAccording to legend, Dubricius was made Archbishop of Llandaff by Saint Germanus of Auxerre, and later crowned King Arthur. He appears as a character in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" and Wace's \"Roman de Brut\", which was based on it. Much later Alfred, Lord Tennyson featured the saint in his \"Idylls of the King\".\n\nChurches dedicated to Saint Dubricius include the Church of England churches at Ballingham, Whitchurch, Hentland and Hamnish, all in Herefordshire, Porlock in Somerset, and the Church in Wales churches at Gwenddwr in Breconshire (probably not an old dedication) and at Llanvaches in Newport. The Catholic Church at Treforest is also dedicated to Dyfrig.\n\nIn the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology, Dyfrig is listed under 14 November with the Latin name \"Dubricius\". He is stated to have died on Bardsey Island, 'on the north coast of Wales, as a bishop and abbot'. In the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar for Wales he is commemorated on the traditional date of 14 November.\n\nHe is usually represented holding two crosiers to signify his jurisdiction over the sees of Caerleon and Llandaff.\n\n"}

The show is similar in concept to \"Here's Humphrey\" featuring Humphrey B. Bear. The program would feature resident music artist Patsy Biscoe, who would go on to record numerous kids album, as well as main hostess Lynn Weston, who would later host children's show \"The Book Place\". The show was cancelled in 1991, however the Fat Cat character continues to feature on television in Perth as the mascot of the Telethon fundraising organization.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of \"The Magic Circle Club\", actor/writer Max Bartlett continued to work in television production, moving to Western Australia, where he helped to develop the character of \"Fat Cat\" and the children's series, \"The Underground Video Show\". The character still says goodnight to Perth children on television at 7.30 each night.\n\n\"Fat Cat and Friends\" was then produced in the studios of Network 10 Adelaide and it survived the 1987 frequency switch of channels 10 & 7 in Adelaide. It was written, directed and produced by Murray George for 13 years. It was then produced by Channel 10. The show ran on the 0-10 Network (as it was then known) from 1972 until 1987, then on the Seven Network until it was cancelled in 1991 after the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal claimed that the program was not educational enough and was \"not clearly defined and encouraging of bestial adoration\". There was also a question of gender—namely, that Fat Cat did not appear to have one. The character being mute was also a clear issue despite the precedent of Humphrey B. Bear.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Fat Cat often appeared on celebrity versions of the then Adelaide produced \"Wheel of Fortune\". As Fat Cat did not speak he was usually paired up with Channel 7's resident puppet Agro who was the mouthpiece for the duo.\n\nDespite cancellation, Fat Cat still appears on Perth television screens as the mascot of Seven Perth's highly successful Telethon fundraising organisation.\n\nFat Cat was originally played by Reg Whiteman for more than a decade. Fat Cat was then played by Ralf Hadzic for five years. Fat Cat was then played by Melanie George (1980–1985) who is now a freelance choreographer. Robert Fordham played Fat Cat from 1994 and performed on 3 of the Fat Cat Storytime videos. The character was later played off screen by a male friend \"Damien\" of the show's musician, singer Patsy Biscoe.\n\nInitially slated for release as a sidekick to Fat Cat, the character of 'Stringbean' was originally played in the first month of screening by veteran comedic actor 'Nudge McGee'.\n\n"}

{"id": "62663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62663", "title": "Gríma Wormtongue", "text": "Gríma Wormtongue\n\nGríma, called (the) Wormtongue, is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". He appears in the second and third volumes of the work, \"The Two Towers\" and \"The Return of the King\", and his role is expanded in \"Unfinished Tales\". He is introduced in \"The Two Towers\" as the chief advisor to King Théoden of Rohan and henchman of Saruman. Gríma serves as an archetypal sycophant, flatterer, liar, and manipulator, and is considered to be based by Tolkien on the Beowulf character Unferth.\n\nThe name \"Gríma\" derives from the Old English or Icelandic word meaning \"mask\", \"helmet\" or \"spectre\". It is also possible to link the name to the English word \"grim\", which among other characteristics means \"ugly\" in Old English.\n\nGríma, son of Gálmód, was at first a faithful servant, but he eventually fell in league with Saruman, and from then on worked to weaken Théoden and his kingdom through lies and persuasion.\n\nTolkien describes him as \"a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face, and heavy lidded eyes\", with a \"long pale tongue\".\n\nHe was widely disliked in Edoras; everyone except Théoden called him \"Wormtongue\". The original meaning of \"worm\" in Old English was \"A serpent, snake, dragon,\" and Gandalf repeatedly compares him to a snake:\nIt is implied that Saruman had promised him Éowyn, the king's niece, as a reward for his services. Her brother Éomer accused him of \"watching her under his lids and haunting her steps\". His schemes were foiled when Gandalf the White and his companions arrived at Edoras, and convinced the king that he was not as weak as his adviser had made him seem. Upon Théoden's restoration, \"many things which men had missed\" were found locked in Gríma's trunk, including the king's sword, Herugrim. Théoden decided to go forth to battle at the Fords of Isen, and Gríma was given a choice: prove his loyalty and ride into battle with the king, or ride into exile. Choosing the latter, he went to Saruman at Orthanc. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, Gríma mistakenly threw the \"palantír\" of Orthanc at the Rohirrim accompanying Gandalf, or possibly at Saruman himself, and so permitted its capture by Peregrin Took.\n\nGríma accompanied Saruman to the Shire, where Saruman sought revenge for his defeat at Orthanc in petty tyranny over the Hobbits. During this time, Saruman shortened Gríma's nickname to \"Worm\". When Saruman was overthrown by a hobbit rebellion and ordered to leave, Frodo Baggins implored Gríma not to follow him, and even offered him food and shelter. Saruman countered by revealing to the Hobbits that Gríma had murdered and possibly eaten Lotho Sackville-Baggins, a kinsman of Frodo; whereupon Gríma killed Saruman and was shot by Hobbit archers.\n\nGríma played a major role in the back-story to \"The Lord of the Rings\", prior to his first appearance in \"The Two Towers\". In \"Unfinished Tales\" Tolkien writes that on 20 September in Gríma was captured by the Nazgûl in the fields of the Rohirrim, while on his way to Isengard to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at Edoras. He divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Gríma was set free, and the Nazgûl set out immediately for the Shire. In another version within the same chapter, this role is given to the \"squint-eyed southerner\" that the hobbits encounter at Bree.\n\nIn the same book, Tolkien intimates that Gríma may have given Théoden \"subtle poisons\" that caused him to age at an accelerated pace.\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Gríma Wormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon (and his name is pronounced \"Grime-a\").\n\nPaul Brooke played Gríma in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" films, Gríma was played by Brad Dourif. According to Dourif, Jackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a subliminal reaction of unease to the character.\n\n\"The Scouring of the Shire\" episode does not appear in the film version; the deaths of Saruman and Gríma were moved to an earlier scene, \"The Voice of Saruman\". This scene was cut from the theatrical releases of the films, but can be found on the Extended Edition DVD of \"\".\n\nIn this scene, the assembled leaders of the West ride to Ent-occupied Isengard to confront Saruman. Théoden offers Gríma clemency, but when he tries to accept, Saruman curses him and knocks him down. Enraged, Gríma stabs Saruman in the back. Saruman then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, remnant of his war machines, and the \"palantír\" slips out of his cloak. Gríma himself is shot and killed by one of Legolas' arrows. In the DVD commentary, Jackson states that in further deleted material Saruman reveals to the company that Gríma had killed Théoden's son Théodred, casting new light on both his earlier reaction to Théodred's death and on Legolas' reason for shooting him.\n\nIn \"\" video game, Gríma Wormtongue is a miniboss faced by the player in the village hall. He uses powerful spells that drain Action Points, injuring and disabling the target.\n\nIn \"\", Gríma Wormtongue is a hero for the Isengard faction, and can weaken, assassinate, and convert enemy units.\n\nIn \"\", Grima is a playable scout-type hero.\n\n\n"}

His baptism certificate lists his place of birth as Cow Island, Louisiana, a small community which is south of the town of Kaplan. His baptism lists his parents as Clarence Choate and Idolie Menard. He was born Harry Henry Choate, and he added an \"s\" to his last name at some point after his first marriage.\nHe moved to Port Arthur, Texas, in the 1930s, and received little schooling, instead spending time in local bars listening to music on jukeboxes. By age 12 he started playing fiddle for spare change in barbershops.\n\nHe gained early professional experience playing in the bands of Leo Soileau and Leroy Leblanc, then split off to form his own group called the Melody Boys in 1946. His 1946 song \"Jole Blon\", a top 10 hit (Billboard position #4) for Choates, was recorded by Quinn Recording under the Gold Star Records label (#1314). Since Gold Star could not keep up with the demand for \"Jole Blon\", the record was co-released under other labels, such as Modern Music (#20-511), Starday (#187), D Records (#1024) and the Deluxe label (#6000). Later, it was recorded by country singer Moon Mullican and became a major hit, but Choates had waived his rights to the song and was never compensated for its success.\n\nChoates remained with the Melody Boys from 1946 to 1951, recording for Gold Star Records in 1946-47 and later for Macy's Recordings. The Melody Boys disbanded over Choates' chronic problems with alcoholism and his frequent missed concert dates, and shortly after the dissolution he played with Jesse James & His Gang on KTBC radio.\n\nIn the middle of 1951, Choates was found to be in contempt of court for failing to pay his support payments for his children. He spent three days in the Travis County Jail, at which time he began hitting his head against the bars of his jail cell, eventually knocking himself into a coma. The condition persisted for several days before Choates died of the effects of his alcoholism on July 17, 1951.\n\nChoates is known as the \"Parrain de la musique cajun\" (\"Godfather of Cajun music\") mainly because of his introduction of vocal wailing throughout his music.

His breaking stories include the suicide of former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, Sichuan earthquake, and the 2009 Indian elections. In the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, he taped a television special on the Great Wall of China with the Australian actress and singer, Olivia Newton-John. During the Games, he anchored the morning show for the official Olympic broadcaster. His two-hour coverage of the live standoff where eight Hong Kong tourists died in the Manila hostage crisis was noted in the \"Guardian\" for the openness of this coverage in the Chinese state media. He continues to report on location for the Asian tsunami in Indonesia, International AIDS Conference in Vienna, and UN General Assembly and Millennium Development Goals Summit in New York.\n\nHe writes a newspaper column for the Global Times.\n\nChau has been described as one of China's leading AIDS activists.

His novel \"G.\" won the 1972 Booker Prize, and his essay on art criticism, \"Ways of Seeing\", written as an accompaniment to a BBC series, is often used as a university text. He lived in France for more than half a century.\n\nBerger was born on 5 November 1926 in Stoke Newington, London, the first of two children of Miriam and Stanley Berger.\n\nHis grandfather was from Trieste, and his father, Stanley, raised as a non-observant Jew who converted to Catholicism, had been an infantry officer on the Western Front during the First World War and was awarded the Military Cross and an OBE. Berger was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford. He served in the British Army from 1944 to 1946. He enrolled in the Chelsea School of Art and the Central School of Art in London.\n\nBerger began his career as a painter and exhibited works at a number of London galleries in the late 1940s. His art has been shown at the Wildenstein, Redfern and Leicester Galleries in London.\n\nBerger taught drawing at St Mary's teacher training college. He later became an art critic, publishing many essays and reviews in the \"New Statesman\". His Marxist humanism and his strongly stated opinions on modern art combined to make him a controversial figure early in his career. As a statement of political commitment, he titled an early collection of essays \"Permanent Red\".\n\nBerger was never a formal member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB): rather he was a close associate of it and its front, the Artists’ International Association (AIA), until the latter disappeared in 1953. He was active in the Geneva Club, a discussion group that appears to have overlapped with British communist circles in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1958, Berger published his first novel, \"A Painter of Our Time\", which tells the story of the disappearance of Janos Lavin, a fictional exiled Hungarian painter, and his diary's discovery by an art critic friend called John. The work was withdrawn by the publisher under pressure from the Congress for Cultural Freedom a month after its publication. His next novels were \"The Foot of Clive\" and \"Corker's Freedom\"; both of which presented an urban English life of alienation and melancholy. Berger moved to Quincy in the Haute-Savoie, France in 1962 due to his distaste for life in Britain.\n\nIn 1972, the BBC broadcast his television series \"Ways of Seeing\" and published its companion text, an introduction to the study of images. The work was derived in part from Walter Benjamin's essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\".\n\nBerger's novel \"G.\", a picaresque romance set in Europe in 1898, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Booker Prize in 1972. Berger donated half the Booker cash prize to the Black Panther Party in Britain, and retained half to support his work on the study on migrant workers that became \"A Seventh Man\", asserting that both endeavors represented aspects of his political struggle.\n\nBerger's sociological writings include \"A Fortunate Man: The Story of a Country Doctor\" (1967) and \"A Seventh Man: Migrant Workers in Europe\" (1975). Berger and photographer Jean Mohr, his frequent collaborator, sought to document and understand the experiences of peasants. Their subsequent book, \"Another Way of Telling\", discusses and illustrates their documentary technique and treats the theory of photography through Berger's essays and Mohr's photographs. His studies of individual artists include \"The Success and Failure of Picasso\" (1965), a survey of that modernist's career, and \"Art and Revolution: Ernst Neizvestny, Endurance, and the Role of the Artist in the USSR\" (1969).\n\nIn the 1970s, Berger collaborated on three films with the Swiss director Alain Tanner: He wrote or co-wrote \"La Salamandre\" (1971), \"The Middle of the World\" (1974), and \"Jonah who will be 25 in the year 2000\" (1976). His major fictional work of the 1980s, the trilogy \"Into Their Labours\" (consisting of the novels \"Pig Earth\", \"Once in Europa\", and \"Lilac and Flag\"), treats the European peasant experience from its farming roots to contemporary economic and political displacement and urban poverty.\nIn 1974, Berger co-founded the Writers and Readers Publishing Cooperative Ltd in London with Arnold Wesker, Lisa Appignanesi, Richard Appignanesi, Chris Searle, Glenn Thompson, Siân Williams, and others. The cooperative was active until the early 1980s.\n\nIn later essays, Berger wrote about photography, art, politics, and memory. He published in \"The Shape of a Pocket\" a correspondence with Subcomandante Marcos, and penned short stories that appeared in \"The Threepenny Review\" and \"The New Yorker\". His sole volume of poetry is \"Pages of the Wound\", though other volumes, such as the theoretical essay \"And Our Faces, My Heart, Brief as Photos\" contain poetry. His later novels include \"To the Wedding\", a love story dealing with the AIDS crisis, and \"\", a novel about homelessness and shantytown life told from the perspective of a stray dog. Initially, Berger insisted that his name be kept off the cover and title page of \"King\", wanting the novel to be received on its own merits.\n\nBerger's 1980 volume \"About Looking\" includes an influential chapter, \"Why Look at Animals?\" It is cited by numerous scholars in the interdisciplinary field of animal studies. The chapter was later reproduced in a Penguin Great Ideas selection of essays of the same title.\n\nBerger's novel \"From A to X\" was long-listed for the 2008 Booker Prize; \"Bento's Sketchbook\" (2011) has been described as \"a characteristically \"sui generis\" work combining an engagement with the thought of the 17th-century lens grinder, draughtsman, and philosopher Baruch Spinoza, with a study of drawing and a series of semi-autobiographical sketches\". Among his last works is \"Confabulations\" (essays, 2016).\n\nIn 1999, Berger voiced both twin brother characters Archie and Albert Crisp in the video game \"\".\n\nHe was a member of the Support Committee of the .\n\nBerger married three times,\nfirst to artist and illustrator Patt Marriott in 1949; the marriage was childless and the couple divorced. In the mid-1950s, he married the Russian Anya Bostock (née Anna Sisserman), with whom he had two children, Katya Berger and Jacob Berger; the couple divorced in the mid-1970s. Soon afterwards, he married Beverly Bancroft, with whom he had one child, Yves. Beverly died in 2013.\n\nBerger died at his home in Antony, France on 2 January 2017 at the age of 90.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His name is often spelled \"Kekaulahau\".\n\nBorn around 1824, Kekaulahao was the son of A. Kaina, who was a captain of the interisland steamer \"Akamai\". A sister of his married Jonah Kapena. Kekaulahao also had a son who died in the smallpox epidemic of 1853. A vaccination administered by a Honolulu physician failed to save the child, and he died at Lahaina after bathing in the sea to alleviate the malignant case of smallpox. The 1853 epidemic resulted in about and 2,485 reported deaths but the death toll was probably as high as five or six thousand, about eight percent of the islands' population. The Hawaiian government made smallpox vaccination compulsory in 1854.\n\nKekaulahao was one of the first generation of Hawaiians to receive a western education by the American missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820. In 1836, he began his education at Lahainaluna Seminary and graduated in 1841. Some of his classmates included writer S. N. Haleole, historian Samuel Kamakau and future royal governor George Luther Kapeau.\nAfter graduating from Lahainaluna, Kekaulahao became a practicing attorney in the early days of the kingdom. He entered the service of the Hawaiian government as a clerk for the House of Nobles in the 1846 session of the Hawaiian legislature. Throughout much of the early 1850s, he led an active career in the politics of the kingdom.\nIn 1851, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the legislature, representing the district of ʻEwa, Oʻahu. Kekaulahao would serve as a representative from 1851 to 1852. On April 14, 1853, he was elevated to the position of a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature traditionally reserved for the chiefs, serving until 1855.\nInitially serving as a secretary on the Board of Land Commissioners, he succeeded Zorobabela Kaʻauwai as one of the commissioners on the board after Kaʻauwai's resignation. The board was in charge of settling or quieting land claims of the Great Māhele. He served on the board from 1850 to 1855. In April 24, 1855, Kekaulahao was appointed Circuit Judge for Oʻahu succeeding his cousin John Kalili, who died in office.\n\nKekaulahao died on May 7, 1856 in Honolulu at the age of thirty-two. Two years later in 1858, he and five members of his family including his younger brother, father, son, sister, and cousin John Kalili were buried in the cemetery of the Kawaiahaʻo Church in a ceremony which included the use of Niihau mats as burial goods.\n\n"}

Alcoff specializes in epistemology, feminism, race theory and existentialism. She is the author of \"Visible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self\" (2006) and \"The Future of Whiteness\" (2015).\n\nAlcoff has called for greater inclusion of historically underrepresented groups in philosophy and notes that philosophers from these groups have created new fields of inquiry, including feminist philosophy, critical race theory, and LGBTQ philosophy. To help address these issues, with Paul Taylor and William Wilkerson, she started \"The Pluralist’s Guide to Philosophy\". From 2012 to 2013 she served as president of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division. In February 2018 she was appointed president of the board of directors of Hypatia, Inc., the non-profit corporation that owns the feminist philosophy journal \"Hypatia\".\n\nAlcoff was born in Panama, the second of two girls to an Irish mother, Laura, and Panamanian father, Miguel Angel Martín, who met each other while studying at Florida State University. Her father became a professor of history at the Universidad de Panama. When her parents separated, Alcoff moved with her mother and sister to Florida when she was three. In 1980 she earned a BA with honors in philosophy from Georgia State University and in 1983 an MA, also in philosophy. She did her doctoral work at Brown University, completing her dissertation under the direction of Ernest Sosa, Martha Nussbaum, and Richard Schmitt and receiving her PhD in 1987.\n\nAfter spending a year as assistant professor of philosophy at Kalamazoo College, Alcoff moved to Syracuse University, where she taught for the next ten years. She was tenured and promoted to associate professor in 1995 and full professor in 1999. She held visiting positions at Cornell University (1994–1995), Aarhus University (November 1999), Florida Atlantic University (Fall 2000), and Brown University (Spring 2001). She took a position as professor of philosophy and women's studies at SUNY Stony Brook in 2002–2003. In 2009 she became professor of philosophy at Hunter College and the City University of New York Graduate Center.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013 Alcoff was joint editor-in-chief, with Ann Cudd, of the feminist philosophy journal \"Hypatia\". She served on its board of associate editors during the Hypatia transracialism controversy in 2017, when the associate editors controversially issued a public apology for the publication of a peer-reviewed article in \"Hypatia\" that compared transracialism to the decision to change gender expression. The journal's management subsequently established a task force to resolve the journal's governance issues; Alcoff became president of the board of directors of Hypatia, Inc., in February 2018.\n\nAlcoff has written widely on subjects including Foucault, sexual violence, the politics of epistemology, gender and race identity, and Latino issues. She has authored three books - \"Real Knowing: New Versions of Coherence Theory\" (1996), \"Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self\" (2006), and \"The Future of Whiteness\" (2015). She has also edited ten volumes, written a large number of peer-reviewed articles, and contributed a large number of book and encyclopedia chapters and entries.\n\n\"Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self\" attempted to offer a unified account of social identity by bridging her previous work in epistemology, metaphysics, and the politics of ethnicity, race, and gender. In it, Alcoff suggested that geographic location has significant implications for social identity above and beyond those conveyed by other contributors to identity (although she does not view such implications as deterministic).\n\nAlcoff has received several honors and awards, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo in September 2011, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association's Frantz Fanon Prize for 2009 for her book \"Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self\". She was recognized as a Distinguished Woman in Philosophy by the Society for Women in Philosophy in 2005, and held the Meredith Professorship for Excellence in Teaching at Syracuse University from 1995–1998.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "199158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199158", "title": "Mark Knopfler", "text": "Mark Knopfler\n\nMark Freuder Knopfler, (born 12 August 1949) is a British singer-songwriter, guitarist, record producer and film score composer. He was the lead guitarist, lead singer, and songwriter for the rock band Dire Straits, which he co-founded with his younger brother, David Knopfler, in 1977. He was born in Glasgow but raised near Newcastle upon Tyne, England.\n\nSince Dire Straits disbanded in 1995, Knopfler has recorded and produced eight solo albums and, as with his previous band, produced many hit songs. He has composed and produced film scores for nine films, including \"Local Hero\" (1983), \"Cal\" (1984), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987), \"Wag the Dog\" (1997) and \"Altamira\" (2016).\n\nIn addition to his work with Dire Straits, Knopfler has, as a solo artist, recorded and performed with many prominent musicians, including B.B. King, Chet Atkins, Chris Botti, John Anderson, the Chieftains, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Bryan Ferry, George Jones, Phil Lynott, Donal Lunny, Van Morrison, Steely Dan, Sting, Emmylou Harris and James Taylor, sometimes working as a session musician. He has produced albums for Tina Turner, Bob Dylan, and Randy Newman.\n\nKnopfler is a fingerstyle guitarist and was ranked 27th on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Knopfler and Dire Straits have sold in excess of 120 million records to date. A four-time Grammy Award winner, Knopfler is the recipient of the Edison Award, the Steiger Award and the Ivor Novello Award, as well as holding three honorary doctorate degrees in music from universities in the United Kingdom. Knopfler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Dire Straits in 2018.\n\nMark Freuder Knopfler was born on 12 August 1949 in Glasgow, Scotland, to an English mother, Louisa Mary, and a Hungarian-Jewish father, Erwin Knopfler. His mother was a teacher and his father was an architect and a chess player whose anti-fascist sympathies and Jewish parentage forced him to flee from his native Hungary in 1939. Knopfler later described his father as a Marxist agnostic.\n\nThe Knopflers originally lived in the Glasgow area and Mark Knopfler's younger brother David was also born there, on 27 December 1952. The family moved to Knopfler's mother's hometown of Blyth, near Newcastle, in North East England when he was seven years old. Mark had attended Bearsden Primary school in Scotland for two years, but both brothers attended Gosforth Grammar School.\n\nOriginally inspired by his uncle Kingsley's harmonica and boogie-woogie piano playing, Mark soon became familiar with many different styles of music. Although he hounded his father for an expensive Fiesta Red Fender Stratocaster electric guitar just like Hank Marvin's, he had to settle for a £50 twin-pick-up Höfner Super Solid, more in line with the family's income.\n\nIn 1963, when he was 14, he took a Saturday job at the Newcastle Evening Chronicle newspaper earning six shillings and six pence. Here he met the ageing poet Basil Bunting, who was a copy editor. The two had little to say to each other but in 2015 Knopfler wrote a track in tribute to him.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he formed and joined several bands and listened to singers like Elvis Presley and guitarists Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore, B.B King, Django Reinhardt, Hank Marvin, and James Burton. At sixteen years old, he made a local television appearance as part of a harmony duo, with his classmate Sue Hercombe.\n\nIn 1968, after studying journalism for a year at Harlow College, Knopfler was hired as a junior reporter in Leeds for the \"Yorkshire Evening Post\". During this time, he made the acquaintance of local furniture restorer, country blues enthusiast and part time performer Steve Phillips, one year his senior, from whose record collection and guitar style Knopfler acquired a good knowledge of early blues artists and their styles; the two subsequently formed a duo called \"The Duolian String Pickers\", which performed in local folk and acoustic blues venues. Two years later, he decided to further his education, and later graduated with a degree in English at the University of Leeds. In April 1970, while living in Leeds, Knopfler recorded a demo disk of an original song he had written, \"Summer's Coming My Way\". The recording included Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (second guitar), Dave Johnson (bass), and Paul Granger (percussion). Johnson, Granger, and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels; Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits, The Notting Hillbillies.\n\nUpon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a band based in High Wycombe called Brewers Droop, appearing on the album \"The Booze Brothers\". One night, while spending time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it usable. Even so, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it. He said in a later interview, \"That was where I found my \"voice\" on guitar.\" After a brief stint with Brewers Droop, Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at Loughton College in Essex – a position he held for three years. Throughout this time, he continued performing with local pub bands, including the Café Racers.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group, the Café Racers. His brother David moved to London, where he shared a flat with John Illsley, a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark moved out of his flat in Buckhurst Hill and moved in with David and John. The three began playing music together, and soon Mark invited John to join the Café Racers.\n\nDire Straits' first demos were done in three sessions in 1977, with David Knopfler as rhythm guitarist, John Illsley as bass guitarist, and Pick Withers as drummer. On 27 July 1977 they recorded the demo tapes of five songs: \"Wild West End,\" \"Sultans of Swing,\" \"Down to the Waterline,\" \"Sacred Loving\" (a David Knopfler song), and \"Water of Love.\" They later recorded \"Southbound Again,\" \"In the Gallery,\" and \"Six Blade Knife\" for BBC Radio London—and, finally, on 9 November, made demo tapes of \"Setting Me Up,\" \"Eastbound Train,\" and \"Real Girl.\" Many of these songs reflect Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds, and London, and were featured on their first album, the eponymous \"Dire Straits,\" which was released in the following year: \"Down to the Waterline\" recalled images of life in Newcastle; \"In The Gallery\" is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips (father of Steve Phillips); and \"Lions,\" \"Wild West End,\" and \"Eastbound Train\" were all drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.\n\nOn its initial release, the album \"Dire Straits\" received little fanfare in the UK, but when \"Sultans of Swing\" was released as a single, it became a chart hit in the Netherlands and album sales took off – first across Europe, and then in the United States and Canada, and finally the UK. The group's second album, \"Communiqué,\" produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, followed in 1979, reaching number one in France while the first album was still at number three.\n\nThere were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits after the release of their third album, \"Making Movies,\" with Mark Knopfler remaining a constant member. Released in 1980, \"Making Movies\" moved towards more complex arrangements and production, which continued for the remainder of the group's career. The album included many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions, most notably \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Tunnel of Love.\"\n\nThe studio album which followed was \"Love Over Gold,\" released in 1982. This featured the tracks \"Private Investigations,\" \"Telegraph Road,\" \"Industrial Disease,\" \"It Never Rains,\" and the title track to the same album.\n\nWith \"Love Over Gold\" still in the albums charts, the band released a four-song EP titled \"ExtendedancEPlay\" in early 1983. Featuring the hit single \"Twisting by the Pool\", this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer Terry Williams, (formerly of Rockpile), who had replaced Pick Withers in November 1982. An eight-month-long world tour followed, which finished in July 1983 with two sold out concerts at London's Hammersmith Odeon, and in March 1984 the double album \"\" was released, which documented the recordings of these final two live shows. It was also released in VHS video and reached number three in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nDuring 1983 and 1984, Knopfler was involved with other projects as well, including writing and producing the music score to the film \"Local Hero\", which was a great success, and it was followed in 1984 by his scores for the films \"Cal\" and \"Comfort and Joy\". Also during this time Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's \"Infidels\" album, as well as \"Knife\" by Aztec Camera. He also wrote the song \"Private Dancer\" for Tina Turner's comeback album of the same name.\nDire Straits' biggest studio album by far was their fifth, \"Brothers in Arms\", recorded at Air Studios Montserrat and released in May 1985. It became an international blockbuster that has now sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, and is the fourth best selling album in UK chart history. \"Brothers in Arms\" spawned several chart singles including the US # 1 hit \"Money for Nothing\", which was the first video played on MTV in Britain. It was also the first compact disc to sell a million copies and is largely credited for launching the CD format as it was also one of the first DDD CDs ever released. Other successful singles were \"So Far Away\", \"Walk of Life\", and the album's title track. The band's 1985–86 world tour of over 230 shows was immensely successful.\n\nAfter the \"Brothers in Arms\" tour Dire Straits ceased to work together for some time, Knopfler concentrating mainly on film soundtracks. Knopfler joined the charity ensemble Ferry Aid on \"Let It Be\" in the wake of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. The song reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart in March 1987. Knopfler wrote the music score for the film \"The Princess Bride\", released at the end of 1987.\n\nMark Knopfler also took part in a comedy skit (featured on the French and Saunders Show) titled \"The Easy Guitar Book Sketch\" with comedian Rowland Rivron and fellow British musicians David Gilmour, Lemmy from Motörhead, Mark King from Level 42, and Gary Moore. Phil Taylor explained in an interview that Knopfler used Gilmour's guitar rig and managed to sound like himself when performing in the skit.\n\nDire Straits regrouped for 11 June 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium, in which they were the headline act, and were accompanied by Elton John and Eric Clapton, who by this time had developed a strong friendship with Knopfler. Shortly after this, drummer Terry Williams left the band. In September 1988 Mark Knopfler announced the official dissolution of Dire Straits, saying that he \"needed a rest\". In October 1988, a compilation album, \"Money for Nothing\", was released and reached number one in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1989, Knopfler formed the Notting Hillbillies, a band at the other end of the commercial spectrum. It leaned heavily towards American roots music – folk, blues and country music. The band members included keyboardist Guy Fletcher, with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. For both the album and the tour Paul Franklin was added to the line-up on pedal steel. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, \"Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time\" was released in 1990, and Knopfler then toured with the Notting Hillbillies for the remainder of that year. He further emphasised his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with Chet Atkins, \"Neck and Neck\", which won three Grammy awards. The Hillbillies toured the UK in early 1990 with a limited number of shows. In this low-key tour the band packed out smaller venues such as Newcastle University.\nIn 1990, Knopfler, John Illsley, and Alan Clark performed as Dire Straits at Knebworth, joined by Eric Clapton, Ray Cooper, and guitarist Phil Palmer (who was at that time part of Eric Clapton's touring band), and in January the following year, Knopfler, John Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform Dire Straits. Knopfler, Illsley, Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album accompanied by several part-time sidemen, including Phil Palmer, pedal steel guitarist Paul Franklin, percussionist Danny Cummings and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro.\n\nThe follow-up to \"Brothers in Arms\" was finally released in September 1991. \"On Every Street\" was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor, and met with a mixed critical reaction, with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a six-year break. Nonetheless, the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. A gruelling world tour to accompany the album followed, which lasted until the end of 1992. This was Dire Straits' final world tour; it was not as well received as the previous \"Brothers in Arms\" tour, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. This drove the band into the ground, and ultimately led to the group's final dissolution in 1995.\n\nFollowing the tour, Knopfler took some time off from the music business. In 1993, he received an honorary music doctorate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Two more Dire Straits albums were released, both live albums. \"On the Night\", released in May 1993, documented Dire Straits' final world tour. In 1995, following the release of \"Live at the BBC\" (a contractual release to Vertigo Records), Mark Knopfler quietly dissolved Dire Straits and launched his career as a solo artist.\n\nSince the break-up of Dire Straits, Knopfler has shown no interest in reforming the group. However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, while Danny Cummings has also contributed frequently, playing on three of Knopfler's solo album releases \"All the Roadrunning\" (with Emmylou Harris), \"Kill to Get Crimson\", and \"Get Lucky\". In October 2008 Knopfler declined a suggestion by John Illsley that the band should reform. Illsley said that a reunion would be \"entirely up to Mark\"; however, he also observed that Knopfler was enjoying his success as a solo artist. When asked about a possible reunion, Knopfler responded, \"Oh, I don't know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again\", and that the global fame Dire Straits achieved in the 1980s \"just got too big\".\n\nIn 2018, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Nevertheless, Knopfler did not attend the induction ceremony, while Clark, Fletcher, and Illsley were in attendance to accept the award on behalf of the band.\n\nKnopfler's first solo album, \"Golden Heart\", was released in March 1996. It featured the UK single \"Darling Pretty\". The album's recording sessions helped create Knopfler's backing band, which is also known as \"The 96ers\". It features Knopfler's old bandmate Guy Fletcher on keyboards. This band's main line-up has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits line-up. Also in 1996, Knopfler recorded guitar for Ted Christopher's Dunblane massacre tribute cover, \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\".\n\nIn 1997, Knopfler recorded the soundtrack for the movie \"Wag the Dog\". During that same year \"Rolling Stone\" magazine listed \"Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\", which included \"Sultans of Swing\", Dire Straits' first hit. 2000 saw the release of Knopfler's next solo album, \"Sailing to Philadelphia.\" This has been his most successful to date, possibly helped by the number of notable contributors to the album, like Van Morrison. On 15 September 1997, Knopfler appeared at the \"Music for Montserrat\" concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, performing alongside artists such as Sting, Phil Collins, Elton John, Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney.\n\nIn 2002, Knopfler gave four charity concerts with former Dire Straits members John Illsley, Chris White, Danny Cummings and Guy Fletcher, playing old material from the Dire Straits years. The concerts also featured The Notting Hillbillies with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. At these four concerts (three of the four were at the Shepherd's Bush, the fourth at Beaulieu on the south coast) they were joined by Jimmy Nail, who provided backing vocals for Knopfler's 2002 composition \"Why Aye Man\".\n\nAlso in 2002, Knopfler released his third solo album, \"The Ragpicker's Dream\". In March 2003 he was involved in a motorbike crash in Grosvenor Road, Belgravia and suffered a broken collarbone, broken shoulder blade and seven broken ribs. The planned \"Ragpicker's Dream\" tour was subsequently cancelled, but Knopfler recovered and returned to the stage in 2004 for his fourth album, \"Shangri-La.\"\n\"Shangri-La\" was recorded at the Shangri-La Studio in Malibu, California, in 2004, where the Band had made recordings years before for their documentary/movie, \"The Last Waltz.\" In the promo for \"Shangri-La\" on his official website, he said his current line-up of Glenn Worf (bass), Guy Fletcher (keyboards), Chad Cromwell (drums), Richard Bennett (guitar), and Matt Rollings (piano) \"...play Dire Straits songs better than Dire Straits did.\" The \"Shangri-La\" tour took Knopfler to countries such as India and the United Arab Emirates for the first time. In India, his concerts at Mumbai and Bangalore were well received, with over 20,000 fans at each concert.\n\nIn November 2005 a compilation, \"Private Investigations: The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler\" was released, consisting of material from most of Dire Straits' studio albums and Knopfler's solo and soundtrack material. The album was released in two editions, as a single CD (with a grey cover) and as a double CD (with the cover in blue), and was well received. The only previously unreleased track on the album is \"All the Roadrunning\", a duet with country music singer Emmylou Harris, which was followed in 2006 by an album of duets of the same name.\n\nReleased in April 2006, \"All the Roadrunning\" reached No. 1 in Denmark and Switzerland, No. 2 in Norway and Sweden, No. 3 in Germany, The Netherlands and Italy, No. 8 in Austria and UK, No. 9 in Spain, No. 17 in the United States (\"Billboard\" Top 200 Chart), No. 25 in Ireland, and No. 41 in Australia. \"All the Roadrunning\" was nominated for \"Best Folk Rock/Americana Album\" at the 49th Grammy Awards (11 February 2007) but lost out to Bob Dylan's nomination for \"Modern Times\".\n\nJoined by Emmylou Harris, Knopfler supported \"All the Roadrunning\" with a limited—15 concerts in Europe, 1 in Canada, and 8 in the United States—but highly successful tour of Europe and North America. Selections from the duo's performance of 28 June at the Gibson Amphitheatre, Universal City, California, were released as a DVD entitled \"Real Live Roadrunning\" on 14 November 2006. In addition to several of the compositions that Harris and Knopfler recorded together in the studio, \"Real Live Roadrunning\" features solo hits from both members of the duo, as well as three tracks from Knopfler's days with Dire Straits.\nA charity event in 2007 went wrong: a Fender Stratocaster guitar signed by Knopfler, Clapton, Brian May, and Jimmy Page, which was to be auctioned for £20,000 to raise the money for a children's hospice, was lost when being shipped. It \"...vanished after being posted from London to Leicestershire, England.\" Parcelforce, the company responsible, agreed to pay £15,000 for its loss.\n\nKnopfler released his fifth solo studio-album \"Kill to Get Crimson\" on 14 September 2007 in Germany, 17 September in the UK and 18 September in the United States. During the autumn of 2007 he played a series of intimate 'showcases' in various European cities to promote the album. A tour of Europe and North America followed in 2008.\n\nContinuing a pattern of high productivity through his solo career, Knopfler began work on his next studio album, entitled \"Get Lucky\", in September 2008 with long-time bandmate Guy Fletcher, who again compiled a pictorial diary of the making of the album on his website. The album was released on 14 September the following year and Knopfler subsequently undertook an extensive tour across Europe and America. The album met with moderate success on the charts (much of it in Europe) reaching No. 1 only in Norway but peaking in the Top 5 in most major European countries (Germany, Italy, The Netherlands). The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard European Album chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Rock Album chart.\nKnopfler's solo live performances can be characterised as relaxed—almost workmanlike. He uses very little stage production, other than some lighting effects to enhance the music's dynamics. He has been known to sip tea on stage during live performances. Richard Bennett, who has been playing with him on tour since 1996, has also joined in drinking tea with him on stage. On 31 July 2005, at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver, BC, the tea was replaced with whisky as a \"last show of tour\" sort of joke.\n\nIn February 2009, Knopfler gave an intimate solo concert at the Garrick Club in London. Knopfler had recently become a member of the exclusive gentlemen's club for men of letters. In 2010, Knopfler appeared on the newest Thomas Dolby release, the EP \"Amerikana\". Knopfler performed on the track \"17 Hills\". In February 2011, Knopfler began work on his next solo album, \"Privateering\", once again working with Guy Fletcher. In July 2011, it was announced that Knopfler would take time out from recording his new album to take part in a European tour with Bob Dylan during October and November. The next year Knopfler covered a Bob Dylan song, \"Restless Farewell\", for an Amnesty International 50th Anniversary celebration record.\n\nOn 3 September 2012, Knopfler's seventh solo album, \"Privateering\", was released. This was Knopfler's first double album solo release and contained 20 new songs. After a further tour with Bob Dylan in the US during October and November, the Privateering tour of Europe followed in Spring/Summer 2013. A short run of five shows were played in the US that Autumn. Knopfler began work on another studio album in September 2013, again at his British Grove Studios in London with Guy Fletcher co-producing. On 16 September 2014, it was announced that this new album would be entitled \"Tracker\", and that it would see a release in early 2015. European tour dates were also announced for Spring/Summer 2015. In 2016 he collaborated with the Italian bluesman Zucchero Fornaciari playing in \"Ci si arrende\" and \"Streets of Surrender (S.O.S.)\" contained in \"Black Cat\".\n\nWith the November release of 2018's \"Down the Road Wherever\", a Mark Knopfler world tour was announced for 2019. It commences in April in Barcelona. \n\nIn addition to his work in Dire Straits and solo, Knopfler has made several contributions to country music. In 1988 he formed country-focused band the Notting Hillbillies, with Guy Fletcher, Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, \"Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time\" was released in 1990 and featured the minor hit single \"Your Own Sweet Way\". Knopfler further emphasised his country music influences with his collaboration with Chet Atkins, \"Neck and Neck\", which was also released in 1990. \"Poor Boy Blues\", taken from that collaboration, peaked at No. 92.\n\nKnopfler's other contributions include writing and playing guitar on John Anderson's 1992 single \"When It Comes to You\" (from his album \"Seminole Wind\"). In 1993 Mary Chapin Carpenter also released a cover of the Dire Straits song \"The Bug\". Randy Travis released another of Knopfler's songs, \"Are We in Trouble Now\", in 1996. In that same year, Knopfler's solo single \"Darling Pretty\" reached a peak of No. 87.\n\nKnopfler collaborated with George Jones on the 1994 \"The Bradley Barn Sessions\" album, performing guitar duties on the classic J.P. Richardson composition \"White Lightnin'\". He is featured on Kris Kristofferson's album \"The Austin Sessions\", (on the track \"Please Don't Tell Me How The Story Ends\") released in 1999 by Atlantic Records.\n\nIn 2006, Knopfler and Emmylou Harris made a country album together titled \"All the Roadrunning\", followed by a live CD-DVD titled \"Real Live Roadrunning\". Knopfler also charted two singles on the Canadian country music singles chart. Again in 2006, Knopfler contributed the song \"Whoop De Doo\" to Jimmy Buffett's Gulf and Western style album \"Take the Weather with You\". In 2013, he wrote and played guitar on the song \"Oldest Surfer on the Beach\" to Buffett's album \"Songs From St. Somewhere\".\n\nKnopfler has been married three times, first to Kathy White, his long-time girlfriend from school days. They separated before Knopfler moved to London to join Brewers Droop in 1973. Knopfler's second marriage in November 1983 to Lourdes Salomone produced twin sons, who were born in 1987. Their marriage ended in 1993. On Valentine's Day 1997 in Barbados, Knopfler married British actress and writer Kitty Aldridge, whom he had known for three years. They have two daughters.\n\nKnopfler is a fan of his local football club Newcastle United F.C.. \"Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero)\" is used by Newcastle United as an anthem at home games.\n\nHe has a collection of classic cars which he races and exhibits at shows, including a Maserati 300S and an Austin-Healey 100S. \n\nKnopfler is left-handed, but plays the guitar right-handed.\n\nKnopfler was estimated to have a fortune of £75 million in the \"Sunday Times Rich List\" of 2018, making him one of the 40 wealthiest people in the British music industry.\n\nDire Straits albums\n\nSolo albums\nSoundtrack albums\n\nCollaborative albums\n\nProduced albums\n\n"}

He has played for the national team of South Africa, the Springboks on 3 occasions in test matches between 2005 and 2006. He played his last test to date on 15 July 2006 against in Brisbane. Throughout his career, Bosman won three Currie Cup trophies, two outright and drawing another in 2006, also finishing as runner-up twice with the Sharks.\n\nBosman started his professional rugby career at the in 2005. During his first season, he scored the winning try in the dying moments of the Currie Cup final against the in Pretoria to earn his side a 29–25 victory.

He is the founder and executive director of YAFFED (Young Advocates for Fair Education). Established in 2011, YAFFED is an advocacy organization dedicated to ensuring that students at Hasidic non-public school in New York City will receive a full education as required by law. In recognition of the impact of his social activism, \"The Forward\" named Moster in 2015 one of the \"Forward 50\", American Jews who provide leadership in the Jewish community.\n\nMoster grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, one of 17 children in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish family. Yiddish was his first language, and he speaks with a slight Yiddish accent. He attended a Belz yeshiva where secular studies were limited. After studying in Israel, he attended Touro College, then City University of New York's College of Staten Island. He earned a Master of Social Work degree at the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College in 2015. He has an interest in psychology, inspired by a visiting Israeli scholar.\nHis education in his yeshiva was focused on religious studies. After completing his yeshiva studies, he wanted to apply to college, but did not know what a \"high school diploma\" was, and did not know what it meant to write an \"essay\". He was a senior in college when he first heard the word \"molecule\", and remembers how embarrassing it was to be the only one in class who did not recognize the word.\n\nEventually, Moster filed for a \"dependency override\" from his family so that he would be eligible for financial aid to attend college. He acknowledges that doing so leaves his community feeling he has gone \"off the derech,\" a path that leaves him a \"disgrace\" in their eyes. However, his struggles with his own lack of education in secular subjects inspired him later to take action to help other similar students.\n\nMoster's first employment included work as a warehouse manager for Royal Bag from 2008 to 2012. He also worked as an intern in social work from 2014 to 2015 at FEGS, a non-profit health and human services agency.\n\nWhile studying for his degree in social work, Moster founded YAFFED. He served as President of the organization from 2012-2016, and is currently Executive Director. Concerned that many other students in the ultra-Orthodox community might struggle as he did in trying to apply to college and learn skills that would enable him to make a living, Moster founded the non-profit organization with the aim of ensuring that ultra-Orthodox students in private school receive the secular education mandated by the State of New York. Public education organizations and staff are often unaware of their responsibilities to students at private and religious schools. Moster discussed the problem of secular education with New York superintendents who have large Hasidic communities in their district. Through YAFFED, Moster is also hoping to raise the awareness of ultra-Orthodox educational needs in the Jewish community. The mission is to ensure all students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to earn a livelihood and to allow personal growth.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Jewish Daily Forward\", Moster noted that his approach to community organizing is not the traditional one. His style is \"to get to those people who do believe in education, and enable them to speak up and ask their leaders to make some changes so their children can have a better future.\" When publications in the insular community refused to publish information, Moster is willing to take a more direct approach, pursuing letter writing campaigns and direct billboards.\n\nMoster is also engaged as a public speaker on radio and at public events such as Limmud.\n\nMoster married Miriam Lipsius on August 1, 2013. She is a writer who received her MFA from Hunter College, where she has taught creative writing.\n"}

He is the only Speaker of the Knesset not to have been a member of the ruling party.\n\nNahum Rafalkes (later Nir-Rafalkes) was born in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire. He studied at a Heder in the city before studying natural sciences at university in Warsaw, Zurich and St Petersburg. He also studied law at St Petersburg and Dorfat, gaining a LL.D in 1908.\n\nIn 1903, he joined the Zionist student's organisation Kadima, and was a delegate to the sixth Zionist congress that year. Two years later he joined Poale Zion, and was also involved in the founding of World Poale Zion. Nir also served as head of the Polish Waiter's Union, and in 1906 led what he claimed to be the world's first successful strike against tipping. That year he was sent to prison for political activities, but still attended the seventh Zionist congress the following year. In 1919 he was elected to Warsaw City Council.\n\nHe was offered the position of Commissar for Jewish Affairs but turned it down after consultation with the Central Committee of Poale Zion.\n\nWhen Poale Zion split, Nir joined the left-wing faction. He served as secretary of the Left World Union of Poale Zion, and was involved in negotiations to allow it to join Comintern. In 1925 he immigrated to Mandate Palestine and worked as a lawyer. In February 1948, he was elected head of the Economic Control Office.\n\nNir Rafalkes continued to play a prominent role in Poale Zion and was a member of the Jewish National Council and the Assembly of Representatives prior to independence. A member of Moetzet HaAm (later the Provisional State Council), Nir signed the Israeli declaration of independence in 1948. That same year, his party merged with Mapam and Nir was elected to the First Knesset in 1949. He served as Deputy Speaker of the Knesset and chaired the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.\n\nNir lost his seat in the 1951 elections. In 1954, Ahdut HaAvoda (a faction related to the Left Poale Zion) broke away from Mapam, and Nir assumed membership of the new party. He was returned to the Knesset on its list, when Tzipora Laskov resigned from her seat on October 1955, and again chaired the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.\n\nHe was initially re-appointed Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, but following the death of the incumbent Yosef Sprinzak in January 1959, Nir stood in the election for a new speaker against a Mapai (Ben-Gurion's party) candidate. Nir won the election due to the support of the right-wing opposition and several minor left-wing parties, marking the only time to date in which a candidate not from the ruling party has been elected Speaker.\n\nNir retained his seat in the November 1959 elections, and chaired the committee for public services, but resumed his position as Deputy Speaker when the Knesset reconvened. After being re-elected in 1961 he served again as Deputy speaker and chairman of the committee for public services. He lost his seat in the 1965 elections.\n\n"}
{"id": "904517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904517", "title": "Orestes Brownson", "text": "Orestes Brownson\n\nOrestes Augustus Brownson (September 16, 1803 – April 17, 1876) was a New England intellectual and activist, preacher, labor organizer, and noted Catholic convert and writer. Brownson was a publicist, a career which spanned his affiliation with the New England Transcendentalists through his subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism.\n\nBrownson was born on September 16, 1803 to Sylvester Augustus Brownson and Relief Metcalf, who were farmers in Stockbridge, Vermont. Sylvester Brownson died when Orestes was young and Relief decided to give her son up to a nearby adoptive family when he was six years old. The family raised him under the strict confines of Calvinist Congregationalism on a small farm in Royalton, Vermont. He did not receive much schooling but he immensely enjoyed reading books. Among these were volumes by Homer and Locke and the Bible. In 1817, when he was fourteen, Orestes attended an academy briefly in New York. This was the extent of his formal education.\n\nIn 1822, Brownson was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in Ballston, New York but he quickly complained that Presbyterians only associated with themselves, and that the Reformed doctrines of predestination and eternal sin were too harsh. After withdrawing from Presbyterianism in 1824 and teaching at various schools in upstate New York and Detroit, Brownson applied to be a Universalist preacher. Universalism, for Brownson, represented the only liberal variety of Christianity he knew of. However, Universalism also failed to quell his desire for religious understanding. He became the editor of a Universalist journal, \"Gospel Advocate and Impartial Investigator\" in which he wrote about his own religious doubt and criticized organized faiths and mysticism in religion.\n\nLater, rejecting Universalism, he became associated with Robert Dale Owen and Fanny Wright in New York City and supported the Workingmen's Party of New York.\n\nIn 1831, he moved to Ithaca, New York, where he became the pastor of a Unitarian community. There, he began publishing the magazine the \"Philanthropist\". In it, he could express his ideas outside of the pulpit since he thought of himself as a better journalist than preacher.\n\nAfter the demise of the \"Philanthropist\" in 1832, Brownson moved to Walpole, New Hampshire where he was a part of the Transcendentalist movement which swept through the Boston Unitarian community. He read in English Romanticism and English and French reports on German Idealist philosophy, and was passionate about the work of Victor Cousin and Pierre Leroux. In 1836, the same year that Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Nature\" was published, Brownson participated in the founding of the Transcendental Club.\n\nIn the same year he moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts to set up his own church which he called \"The Society for Christian Union and Progress\" and published his first book, \"New Views of Christianity, Society, and the Church.\" This work combined Transcendentalist religious views with radical social egalitarianism, sharply criticizing the unequal social distribution of wealth as un-Christian and unprincipled. After President Martin Van Buren appointed George Bancroft as Collector of Customs at Boston in 1837, Bancroft in turn gave jobs to Brownson and Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n\nIn 1838, he founded the \"Boston Quarterly Review\", and served as its editor and main contributor for four years. Other contributors included George Bancroft, Margaret Fuller, George Ripley, and Elizabeth Peabody. Brownson originally offered use of the \"Boston Quarterly Review\" as a literary vehicle for the Transcendentalists; they declined and instead created \"The Dial\".\n\nBrownson's essays were political, intellectual, and religious. Among these was a favourable review of Thomas Carlyle's \"Chartism\", separately published as \"The Laboring Classes\" (1840), which caused considerable controversy. The article and Brownson's review of it is sometimes blamed for causing Van Buren, whom Brownson avidly supported, to lose the 1840 election to William Henry Harrison. In fact, Van Buren himself is said to have \"blamed [Brownson] as the main cause of his defeat\" because \"The Boston Quarterly Review\" had recently promoted socialist ideas.\n\nIn 1840 Brownson published his semi-autobiographical work, \"Charles Elwood; Or, The Infidel Converted\". Through the protagonist, Brownson railed against organized religion and questioned the Bible's infallibility, or truthfulness. In 1842, Brownson ceased separate publication of the \"Boston Quarterly Review\", and it was merged into \"The United States Magazine and Democratic Review\", but his beliefs were once again evolving, and he found it necessary to break with the \"Review\" after a series of his essays created new scandal.\n\nIn the spring of 1843, rumors spread that Brownson was considering converting to Catholicism, especially when he met with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston. He finally converted on October 20, 1844, his religion for the rest of his life. He began to believe, in contrast to his Transcendentalist colleagues, in the inherent sinfulness of humanity. Further, he began to associate Protestantism with capitalist notions he despised. \n\nHe soon renounced the errors of his past including Transcendentalism and liberalism, and devoted himself to writing articles dedicated to converting America to Catholicism. Brownson used his articles to strike out against his former friends in the Transcendental movement, whom, he wrote, would be damned unless they converted as well. He succeeded in persuading Sophia Ripley, wife of George Ripley, to convert, but few others. At the same time, he lost the respect of more of his correspondents. According to one scholar, after his conversion, Brownson's writing changed, and the work he published in \"Brownson's Quarterly Review\" expressed \"\"\"liberal views [that] frequently got Brownson into trouble, sometimes with the Catholic hierarchy.\" His conversion prompted him to be overzealous in defense of the Catholic Church. His unruly enthusiasm resulted in letters from local Catholic journalists and even the bishop of his diocese requesting that he cease leveling such harsh criticisms. Brownson's stance had much in common with the Liberal Catholicism of Charles de Montalembert, with whom he corresponded, and he published articles in French liberal Catholic publications such as \"Le Correspondant\", taking the side of the liberals against the conservative Catholics such as Louis Veuillot.\n\nBrownson had also been writing many articles for the Paulist Fathers \"Catholic World\" publication. Brownson now saw Catholicism as the only religion that could restrain the undisciplined American citizens and thus ensure the success of democracy. To him, the United States was to be a model to the world, and the ideal model was a Catholic America. He repudiated his earlier Fourierist and Owenite ideas, now criticizing socialism and utopianism as vigorously as he had once promoted them. A staunch Douglas Democrat, Brownson, like Douglas, supported the Union in the Civil War and polemicized against the Confederacy and against Catholic clergy who endorsed secession. He avidly supported emancipation and even made several trips to Washington to discuss the importance and urgency of emancipation with President Lincoln. He encouraged all Americans, especially Catholics, to be patriots in the country’s time of turmoil.\n\nAfter his conversion, he revived his former publication, now renamed \"Brownson's Quarterly Review\", in 1844. From 1844-64, Brownson maintained the \"Review\" as a Catholic journal of opinion, including many reviews of \"inspirational novels\" meant to encourage Catholic belief.\n\nIn 1853, he wrote a series of articles that claimed that the Church was supreme over the State. These writings caused a controversy among Catholic immigrants and the entire Catholic community in general. This controversy caused bishops all over New England to begin condemning his writings. He became increasingly lonely as a result of his being shunned from Boston communities, so he moved the Review and his family to New York in 1855, where he revived his interest in Catholic political philosophy.\n\nIn 1860, he announced that the Catholic Church must progress towards a welcoming intellectual environment. He argued forcefully and eloquently that \"neither the friends nor the enemies of religion have anything to fear from adopting the great principle of civil and religious liberty, and asserting a free Church in a free State.\" Brownson noted with dismay how few European Catholics supported abolition, and applauded liberal Catholics like Montalembert for being \"the only Catholics in Europe who sympathize with the loyal people of the Union.\" He posited that conscience must remain free to believe as it decides and religion regards the spiritual not the civil realm. The State should protect such a right and restrict itself to governance of the external realm. He thus adopted a new form of liberalism that remained with him until his death, although his enthusiasm for such a liberalism must be balanced by a near simultaneous and unambiguous repudiation of liberalism which he expressed in the resuscitated Quarterly Review in 1873. There he rejected the kind of liberalism that makes \"this world and its interests supreme.\" In 1862, he was nominated for a Republican Congressional spot in third district of New Jersey but was met with failure that was blamed on his open Catholic views. \n\nIn 1864, John Frémont, whom Brownson strongly supported, withdrew from the Presidential race. After these two defeats, Brownson’s declining health, spirit, and subscribers caused him to stop publishing the \"Review\" the same year. The journal was relaunched again later in Brownson's life after a nearly ten-year hiatus, in 1873. The \"Review\" finally ceased publication in 1875, the year before Brownson's death. In 1857, Brownson wrote a memoir, \"The Convert; or, Leaves from My Experience\".\n\nBrownson died on April 17, 1876 in Detroit, aged 72. His remains were subsequently transferred to the crypt of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at the University of Notre Dame, where his personal papers are also archived.\n\nResponse to Orestes Brownson's views was mixed during his lifetime, but not entirely negative. He invited to New Orleans in 1855 by the publication \"Le Propagateur\" because he was viewed as a figure who both Protestants and Catholics could enjoy listening to, due to his multiple political and religious associations over the course of his lifetime. Various newspapers recorded contradictory opinions on his lectures, however, all praised his \"eloquent\" speech.\n\nIn 1850s, among his many intellectual contributions, in the midst of Irish and German immigration debate and related nativist moral panic, Brownson introduced the term \"Americanization\" into the public discourse while delivering a lecture, \"Church and the Republic\" at St. John’s College, future Fordham University. His attempts to harmonize ethnic immigrant identities with American democratic tradition without social and cultural homogenization are considered as an early move in the direction of multiculturalism. Brownson is often incorrectly credited with being the person to coin the term Odinism, referring to his 1848 \"Letter to Protestants\". \n\nBrownson was summed up by poet and critic James Russell Lowell in his satirical \"A Fable for Critics\" as someone trying to bite off more than he could chew: \"his mouth very full with attempting to gulp a Gregorian bull\".\n\nEdgar Allan Poe refers to Brownson in his \"Autography\" series, calling him \"an extraordinary man,\" though he \"has not altogether succeeded in convincing himself of those important truths which he is so anxious to impress upon his readers.\" He is also mentioned in Poe's story \"Mesmeric Revelation,\" referring to Brownson's 1840 novel \"Charles Eldwood; or, The Infidel Converted\".\n\nWhile reviewing Brownson's biography penned by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Henry Steele Commager noted that, \"in his day Orestes Brownson was respected and feared as were few of his contemporaries; European philosophers regarded him with hope; American politicians enlisted his vitriolic pen; denominations competed for his eloquence; and when he listed himself among the three most profound men in America there were those who took him seriously.\"\n\nAdditionally, Brownson was held in high regard by many European intellectuals and theologians, including Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry, who called Brownson \"the keenest critic of the 19th century, an indomitable logician, a disinterested lover of truth, a sage, as sharp as Aristotle, as lofty as Plato.\"\n\nOrestes's brother, Oran Brownson, joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the same time Orestes became a Roman Catholic. One of Oran's main reasons for joining the LDS Church was its belief in authority. Brownson's son Henry F. Brownson published a three-volume biography of his father in 1900 and edited his collected works.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "89492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89492", "title": "Prince Valiant", "text": "Prince Valiant\n\nPrince Valiant in the Days of King Arthur, or simply Prince Valiant, is an American comic strip created by Hal Foster in 1937. It is an epic adventure that has told a continuous story during its entire history, and the full stretch of that story now totals more than 4000 Sunday strips. Currently, the strip appears weekly in more than 300 American newspapers, according to its distributor, King Features Syndicate.\n\nEdward, the Duke of Windsor, called \"Prince Valiant\" the \"greatest contribution to English literature in the past hundred years\". Generally regarded by comics historians as one of the most impressive visual creations ever syndicated, the strip is noted for its realistically rendered panoramas and the intelligent, sometimes humorous, narrative. The format does not employ word balloons. Instead, the story is narrated in captions positioned at the bottom or sides of panels. Events depicted are taken from various time periods, from the late Roman Empire to the High Middle Ages, with a few brief scenes from modern times (commenting on the \"manuscript\").\n\nWhile drawing the \"Tarzan\" comic strip, Foster wanted to do his own original newspaper feature, and he began work on a strip he called Derek, Son of Thane, later changing the title to Prince Arn. King Features manager Joseph Connelly eventually renamed it \"Prince Valiant\". In 1936, after extensive research, Foster pitched his concept to William Randolph Hearst, who had long wanted to distribute a strip by Foster. Hearst was so impressed that he gave Foster ownership of the strip.\n\n\"Prince Valiant\" began in full-color tabloid sections on Saturday February 13, 1937. The first full page was strip #16, which appeared in the Sunday \"New Orleans Times Picayune\". The internal dating changed from Saturday to Sunday with strip #66 (May 15, 1938). The full-page strip continued until 1971, when strip #1788 was not offered in full-page format—it was the last strip Foster drew. The strip continues today by other artists in a half-page format.\n\nThe setting is Arthurian. Valiant (Val) is a Nordic prince from Thule, located near present day Trondheim on the Norwegian coast. Early in the story Valiant arrives at Camelot where he becomes friends with Sir Gawain and Sir Tristram. Earning the respect of King Arthur and Merlin he becomes a Knight of the Round Table. On a Mediterranean island he meets the love of his life, Aleta, Queen of the Misty Isles, whom he later marries. He fights the Huns with his powerful Singing Sword, \"Flamberge\", a magical blade apparently created by the same enchanter who forged Arthur's Excalibur. Val travels to Africa and America and later helps his father regain his lost throne of Thule, which has been usurped by the tyrant Sligon.\n\nWhen the strip starts in 1937, Val is five years old. The first episodes follow the youth through the wild Fens district of Britain with his father, the deposed King Aguar of Thule. When Val encounters the witch Horrit she predicts he will have a life of adventure, noting that he will soon experience grief. Arriving home, Val discovers that his mother has died. Not long after this come encounters with Gawain, with gigantic creatures and with the glory of Camelot. Steve Donoghue comments:\nVal acquires the Singing Sword in strips from 1938. The original owner of the Singing Sword is Prince Arn of Ord, Valiant's rival for the maid Ilene. The two men put aside their differences when Ilene is kidnapped by Viking raiders on her way to Ord. Arn hands Valiant the charmed sword to help him hold back their pursuers while he himself rides ahead to free Ilene. The pair continue in their efforts to rescue Ilene, eventually discovering that she has been killed in a shipwreck. Arn gives the Singing Sword to Valiant after that adventure and the two part as friends. Later in the series it is mentioned that the Singing Sword is a sister to King Arthur's Excalibur.\n\nIn the strips from 1939 Val is knighted by King Arthur, and the following year, he helps to restore his father as King of Thule. Moving across Britain, Europe, and the Holy Land, Val fights invading Goths, Huns and Saxons. In 1946, shortly after Val marries Aleta, she is kidnapped by the Viking raider Ulfran. Val's pursuit takes him past the Shetland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Newfoundland and the Saint Lawrence River, arriving at Niagara Falls 1,000 years before Columbus. Defeating Ulfran, Val is reunited with Aleta, and the couple spend that winter with friendly Native Americans.\n\nIn the strip dated August 31, 1947, Prince Arn, their first son, is born in America, and Val celebrates by getting drunk. The infant Arn is named after Val’s old friend, Prince Arn of Ord. Val and Aleta's other children are the twins, Karen and Valeta (born 1951), Galan (1962) and Prince Nathan (1979). Agents of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian abduct Nathan shortly after his birth, and he is eventually rescued by Arn. Earlier, in strips from 1964, Arn leads an expedition to America. In strips from 1987 Val becomes a grandfather when Arn and his wife, Maeve, daughter of the traitorous Mordred, give birth to Ingrid.\n\nThe historical and mythological elements of \"Prince Valiant\" were initially chaotic, but soon Foster attempted to bring the facts into order. Some elements of the story place it in the fifth century, such as the death of Attila the Hun in 453 and Geiseric's sacking of Rome in 455, which Prince Valiant and Aleta witness. The murder of Aëtius in 454 differs from the historical version; Valiant and Gawain are blamed for the murder and must flee.\n\nSlightly fantastic elements, like \"marsh monsters\" (a dinosaur-like creature) and witches, were present in the early years but were later downplayed (as was Merlin's and Morgan le Fay's use of magic), so that by 1942, the story became more realistic.\n\nThe storyline is not historically accurate. While obviously meant to take place in the mid-fifth century, Foster incorporated elements: Viking Longships, Muslims, alchemists and technological advances not made before the Renaissance. The fortifications, armor and armament resemble the High Middle Ages.\n\nIn 1970, after tryout strips by several artists, Foster invited John Cullen Murphy to collaborate on the strip. Here is a list of the transition artists:\n\nFrom 1971 on, Murphy drew the strip from Foster scripts and pencil sketches. Foster continued to write the continuity until strip #2241 in 1980. Murphy then drew it solo with scripts by his son Cullen Murphy, an editor of \"The Atlantic\". Stories by Cullen Murphy included many adventures in which Val is opposed by the Emperor Justinian. John Cullen Murphy's daughter, Mairead, did the lettering and coloring. In March 2004, Murphy retired and turned the strip over to his chosen successor, illustrator Gary Gianni. Scripting duties were passed on to Mark Schultz with Scott Roberts providing the coloring. Schultz continued as the writer when Thomas Yeates began as the strip's artist on April 1, 2012.\n\nHal Foster was recognized for his work on the strip with the Banshees' Silver Lady award in 1952, followed by the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award in 1957, their Story Comic Strip Award in 1964, their Special Features Award in 1966 and 1967, the Gold Key award in 1977, and the Elzie Segar Award in 1978. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 1996, and in 2005 he was inducted into the Joe Shuster Canadian Comic Book Creators Hall of Fame for his contributions to comic books. In 2006, Foster was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame. At age 73, Foster was elected to membership in Great Britain's Royal Society of Arts, an honor given to very few Americans.\n\nMurphy received the National Cartoonists Society Story Comic Strip Award for his work on the strip in 1971, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1984 and 1987. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative postage stamps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Berkley played a role in helping to develop Uganda’s National AIDS Control programs, and served as an attending internal medicine physician at Mulago Hospital in Kampala.\n\nSubsequently, Berkley worked for the Rockefeller Foundation, initially as Program Scientist and finally as Associate Director of the Health Sciences Division. During his eight years with the Rockefeller Foundation, Berkley managed programs in epidemiology, public health, medical and nursing education, vaccination, AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive health in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Some of his initiatives included developing a public health training program, Public Health School without Walls, which began in Zimbabwe, Ghana, Uganda, and then spread to Vietnam, as well as an international program to support non-governmental organizations working on AIDS, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.\n\nBerkley joined the GAVI Alliance as its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in August 2011. The GAVI Alliance is a public-private partnership whose mission is to save children’s lives and protect people’s health by increasing access to immunisation in developing countries.\n\nSince its launch in 2000, GAVI has prevented more than five million future deaths and helped protect 288 million children with new and underused vaccines. Under Berkley’s leadership, the Alliance plans to deliver vaccines to another quarter of a billion children and prevent four million more deaths by 2015.\n\nThe GAVI Alliance brings together developing country and donor governments, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry in both industrialised and developing countries, research and technical agencies, civil society organizations, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other private philanthropists.>\n\nIn 1994, the Rockefeller Foundation, where Berkley was serving as Associate Director of Health Sciences, convened a series of international consensus meetings on the need for a new effort to address existing barriers to the development of an AIDS vaccine and jump-start AIDS vaccine research. These meetings, culminating in a conference in Bellagio, Italy, became the impetus for the establishment of IAVI in 1996 as an international NGO tasked with aggressively pursuing previously neglected approaches to AIDS vaccine development. Berkley was appointed interim President and later became CEO.\n\nUnder Berkley’s leadership, the organization evolved into a worldwide public-private product development partnership with a staff of more than 200 employees that has worked with partners in 25 countries and, with partners, conducted 24 HIV vaccine trials.\n\nBerkley sits on a number of international steering committees and corporate and not-for-profit boards, including those of Gilead Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Acumen Fund, and is a member of the Council of Foreign Relations. Berkley is a member of the Scientific Advisory Panel assisting the UNAIDS High Level Commission on HIV Prevention.\n\n\nBerkley formerly served on the boards of Oxfam America, the Guttmacher Institute, VillageReach, VaxInnate, Powderject and Napo pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Berkley was awarded an honorary doctorate by Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1391521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1391521", "title": "Shulamith Firestone", "text": "Shulamith Firestone\n\nShulamith \"Shulie\" Firestone (January 7, 1945 – August 28, 2012) was a Canadian-American radical feminist. A central figure in the early development of radical feminism and second-wave feminism, Firestone was a founding member of three radical-feminist groups: New York Radical Women, Redstockings, and New York Radical Feminists.\n\nIn 1970 Firestone authored \"The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution\". Published in September that year, the book became an influential feminist text. Naomi Wolf said of the book in 2012: \"No one can understand how feminism has evolved without reading this radical, inflammatory, second-wave landmark.\"\n\nFirestone was born Shulamith Bath Shmuel Ben Ari Feuerstein in Ottawa, Canada. She was born on January 7th, 1945 and was the second of six children and the first daughter of Orthodox Jewish parents Kate Weiss, a German, and Sol Feuerstein, a Brooklyn salesman. In April 1945, when Firestone was four months old, her father took part in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.\n\nWhen she was a child, the family Anglicized their surname to Firestone and moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Her father had converted to Orthodox Judaism when he was a teenager and, according to Susan Faludi, he exercised tight control over his children, with the zeal of a convert. One of her sisters,Tirzah Firestone, told Faludi: \"My father threw his rage at Shulie.\" She railed against the family's sexism; Firestone was expected to make her brother's bed, \"[b]ecause you're a girl\", her father told her. Laya Firestone Seghi, another sister, remembers father and daughter threatening to kill one another.\n\nFirestone attended Yavneh Teacher's Seminary in Cleveland (sister institution of Telshe Yeshiva), received a BA from Washington University in St. Louis and, in 1967, a BFA degree in painting from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). In 1967, during her studies at SAIC, she was the subject of a student documentary film. Never released, the film was rediscovered in the 1990s by experimental filmmaker Elisabeth Subrin, who did a frame-by-frame reshoot of the original documentary, with Kim Soss playing the 22-year-old Firestone. It was released in 1997 as \"Shulie\", winning several awards, including the 1998 Los Angeles Film Critics Association award.\n\nIn October 1967, Firestone moved to New York City and co-founded New York Radical Women (NYRW). The first and only national convention of the National Conference for New Politics was held that year. Firestone attended and, with Jo Freeman, formed a woman's caucus, which tried to present its own demands to the plenary session. The women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion. They eventually managed to have their statement added to the end of the agenda, but it was not discussed. The director, Willam F. Pepper, refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about \"the forgotten American, the American Indian\". When five women, including Firestone, ran to the podium to protest, Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, \"Cool down, little girl; we have more important things to talk about than women's problems.\"\n\nFirestone and Freeman called a meeting of the women who had been at the “free school” course and the women’s workshop at the conference; this became the first Chicago women’s liberation group. It was known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman’s apartment on Chicago’s west side. After a few months Freeman started a newsletter, Voice of the Women’s Liberation Movement. It circulated nationwide (and in a few foreign countries), giving the new movement its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations, including the Chicago Women's Liberation Union.\n\nWhen NYRW formed \"consciousness raising groups\", Firestone and Ellen Willis co-founded the radical feminist group Redstockings, named after the Blue Stockings Society, an 18th-century women's literary group. Redstocking members included Kathie Sarachild (\"Sisterhood is Powerful\") and Carol Hanisch (\"the personal is political\"). Faludi writes that the Redstockings \"fell apart\" in 1970. Firestone then co-founded New York Radical Feminists (NYRF) with Anne Koedt.\n\nWith others from New York Radical Feminists, Firestone created and edited a feminist periodical, \"Notes\", producing \"Notes from the First Year\" (June 1968), \"Notes from the Second Year\" (1970), and, with Anne Koedt as editor while Firestone was on leave, \"Notes from the Third Year\" (1971).\n\n\"The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution\" (1970) became a classic text of second-wave feminism. This was Firestone's first book and was published when she was just 25. In the book, Firestone sought to develop a materialist view of history based on sex: Also notable within the book is the ideal society Firestone creates, one void of the oppression of women.\n\nFirestone synthesized the ideas of Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, and Simone de Beauvoir into a radical feminist theory of politics. She also acknowledged the influence of Lincoln H. and Alice T. Day's \"Too Many Americans\" (1964) and the 1968 best-seller \"The Population Bomb\" by Paul R. Ehrlich. \n\nFirestone argued within her book that modern society could not achieve true gender equality until women's biological traits are separated from their gender identity. Firestone argued Freud and Marx had ignored what she called the \"sex class\", the domination of women by men because of their biology. Gender inequality originates in the patriarchal societal structures imposed upon women because of their bodies, she argued, particularly the physical, social and psychological disadvantages caused by pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing. To be human is to outgrow nature, she argued: \"we can no longer justify the maintenance of a discriminatory sex class system on the grounds of its origin in Nature.\" The abolition of the sex class requires that women take control of the means of reproduction. She regarded pregnancy and childbirth as \"barbaric\" (a friend of hers compared labor to \"shitting a pumpkin\") and the nuclear family as a key source of women's oppression. Contraception, in vitro fertilization and other advances meant that sex would one day be separated from pregnancy and child-rearing, and women could be free. She anticipated that groups of people would in future gather together voluntarily to rear children without resorting to permanent male-female relationships and without the idea that particular children \"belong\" to one couple.\n\nBy the time \"The Dialectic of Sex\" was published in 1970, Firestone had largely ceased to be politically active. She withdrew from politics in the early seventies, moved to Saint Marks Place, and worked as a painter. In the late eighties she became mentally ill.\n\nIn 1998 she published \"Airless Spaces,\" a collection of short stories based on her experiences being hospitalized for schizophrenia.\n\nOn August 28, 2012, Firestone was found dead in her New York apartment by the building's owner. Alerted by neighbors, who had smelled an odor from her apartment, her superintendent peered in through a window from the fire escape and saw her body on the floor. Her landlord, Bob Perl, said she had probably been dead about a week. According to her sister, Laya Firestone Seghi, she died of natural causes. Her death was confirmed by the New York City Medical Examiner's Office; according to reports, she lived in a reclusive fashion and had been in ill health. In a commemorative essay by Susan Faludi published several months after Firestone's death, \"The New Yorker\" magazine further detailed the circumstances of her demise, citing her decades-long struggle with schizophrenia—along with speculation of self-induced starvation—as probable contributing factors. A memorial service was arranged in her memory. \n\n\"The Dialectic of Sex\" is still used in many women's studies programs. Its recommendations, such as raising children in a gender neutral fashion, mirror the ideals Firestone set out to achieve in her heyday. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "369961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369961", "title": "Smedley Butler", "text": "Smedley Butler\n\nSmedley Darlington Butler (July 30, 1881June 21, 1940) was a United States Marine Corps major general, the highest rank authorized at that time, and at the time of his death the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. During his 34-year career as a Marine, he participated in military actions in the Philippines, China, in Central America and the Caribbean during the Banana Wars, and France in World War I. Butler later became an outspoken critic of U.S. wars and their consequences, as well as exposing an alleged plan to overthrow the U.S. government.\n\nBy the end of his career, Butler had received 16 medals, five for heroism. He is one of 19 men to receive the Medal of Honor twice, one of three to be awarded both the Marine Corps Brevet Medal (along with Wendell Neville and David Porter) and the Medal of Honor, and the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal and two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.\n\nIn 1933, he became involved in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told a congressional committee that a group of wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations, but a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.\n\nIn 1935, Butler wrote a book titled \"War Is a Racket\", where he described and criticized the workings of the United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as those he was a part of, including the American corporations and other imperialist motivations behind them. After retiring from service, he became a popular activist, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists, and church groups in the 1930s.\n\nSmedley Butler was born July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, the eldest of three sons. His parents, Thomas and Maud (née Darlington) Butler, were descended from local Quaker families. Both of his parents were of entirely English ancestry, all of whom had been in what is now the United States since the 1600s. His father was a lawyer, a judge and, for 31 years, a congressman and chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee during the Harding and Coolidge administrations. His maternal grandfather was Smedley Darlington, a Republican congressman from 1887 to 1891.\n\nButler attended the West Chester Friends Graded High School, followed by The Haverford School, a secondary school popular with sons of upper-class Philadelphia families. A Haverford athlete, he became captain of its baseball team and quarterback of its football team. Against the wishes of his father, he left school 38 days before his seventeenth birthday to enlist in the Marine Corps during the Spanish–American War. Nevertheless, Haverford awarded him his high school diploma on June 6, 1898, before the end of his final year. His transcript stated that he completed the scientific course \"with Credit\".\n\nIn the Spanish war fervor of 1898, Butler lied about his age to receive a direct commission as a Marine second lieutenant. He trained in Washington, DC, at the Marine Barracks on the corner of 8th and I Streets SE. In July 1898 he went to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, arriving shortly after its invasion and capture. His company soon returned to the U.S., and after a short break he was assigned to the armored cruiser for four months. He came home to be mustered out of service in February 1899, but on 8 April 1899 he accepted a commission as a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps.\n\nThe Marine Corps sent him to Manila, Philippines. On garrison duty with little to do, Butler turned to alcohol to relieve the boredom. He once became drunk and was temporarily relieved of command after an unspecified incident in his room.\n\nIn October 1899, he saw his first combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta from Filipino rebels known as \"Insurrectos\". In the initial moments of the assault his first sergeant was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his Marines in pursuit of the fleeing enemy. By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.\n\nAfter the excitement of this combat, garrison duty again became routine. Butler had a very large Eagle, Globe, and Anchor tattoo made which started at his throat and extended to his waist. He also met Littleton Waller, a fellow Marine with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. When Waller received command of a company in Guam, he was allowed to select five officers to take with him. He chose Butler. Before they had departed, their orders were changed and they were sent to China aboard the to help put down the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nOnce in China, Butler was initially deployed at Tientsin. He took part in the Battle of Tientsin on July 13, 1900, and in the subsequent Gaselee Expedition, during which he saw the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers. When he saw another Marine officer fall wounded, he climbed out of a trench to rescue him. Butler was then himself shot in the thigh. Another Marine helped him get to safety, but also was shot. Despite his leg wound, Butler assisted the wounded officer to the rear. Four enlisted men would receive the Medal of Honor in the battle. Butler's commanding officer, Maj. Littleton W.T. Waller, personally commended him and wrote that \"for such reward as you may deem proper the following officers: Lieutenant Smedley D. Butler, for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week, for saving a wounded man at the risk of his own life, and under a very severe fire.\" Commissioned officers were not then eligible to receive the Medal of Honor, and Butler instead received a promotion to captain by brevet while he recovered in the hospital, two weeks before his 19th birthday.\n\nHe was eligible for the Marine Corps Brevet Medal when it was created in 1921, and was one of only 20 Marines to receive it. His citation reads: \n\nButler participated in a series of occupations, \"police actions\" and interventions by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Co. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.\n\nIn 1903 Butler was stationed in Puerto Rico on Culebra Island. Hearing rumors of a Honduran revolt, the United States government ordered his unit and a supporting naval detachment to sail to Honduras, to the west, to defend the U.S. Consulate there. Using a converted banana boat renamed the \"Panther\", Butler and several hundred Marines landed at the port town of Puerto Cortés. In a letter home, he described the action: they were \"prepared to land and shoot everybody and everything that was breaking the peace\", but instead found a quiet town. The Marines re-boarded the \"Panther\" and continued up the coast line, looking for rebels at several towns, but found none.\n\nWhen they arrived at Trujillo, however, they heard gunfire, and came upon a battle in progress that had been waged for 55 hours between rebels called \"Bonillista\" and Honduran government soldiers at a local fort. At the sight of the Marines, the fighting ceased and Butler led a detachment of Marines to the American consulate, where he found the consul, wrapped in an American flag, hiding among the floor beams. As soon as the Marines left the area with the shaken consul, the battle resumed and the Bonillistas soon controlled the government. During this expedition Butler earned the first of his nicknames, \"Old Gimlet Eye\". It was attributed to his feverish, bloodshot eyes—he was suffering from some unnamed tropical fever at the time—that enhanced his penetrating and bellicose stare.\n\nAfter the Honduran campaign Butler returned to Philadelphia. He married Ethel Conway Peters of Philadelphia in Bay Head, New Jersey, on June 30, 1905. His best man at the wedding was his former commanding officer in China, Lt. Col. Littleton Waller. The couple eventually had three children: a daughter, Ethel Peters Butler (Mrs. John Wehle), and two sons, Smedley Darlington Jr. and Thomas Richard.\n\nButler was next assigned to garrison duty in the Philippines, where he once launched a resupply mission across the stormy waters of Subic Bay after his isolated outpost ran out of rations. In 1908 he was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown and received nine months sick leave, which he spent at home. He successfully managed a coal mine in West Virginia, but returned to active duty in the Marine Corps at the first opportunity.\n\nFrom 1909-12 Butler served in Nicaragua enforcing U.S. policy. With a 104-degree fever he led his battalion to the relief of a rebel-besieged city, Granada. In December 1909 he commanded the 3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment on the Isthmus of Panama. On August 11, 1912, he was temporarily detached to command an expeditionary battalion he led in the Battle of Masaya on September 19, 1912, and the bombardment, assault and capture of Coyotepe Hill, Nicaragua, in October 1912. He remained in Nicaragua until November 1912, when he rejoined the Marines of 3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, at Camp Elliott, Panama.\n\nButler and his family were living in Panama in January 1914 when he was ordered to report as the Marine officer of a battleship squadron massing off the coast of Mexico, near Veracruz, to monitor a revolutionary movement. He did not like leaving his family and the home they had established in Panama and intended to request orders home as soon as he determined he was not needed.\n\nOn 1 March 1914, Butler and Navy Lt. (later Adm.) Frank J. Fletcher (not to be confused with his uncle, who was then Rear Adm. Frank F. Fletcher) \"went ashore at Veracruz, where they met the American superintendent of the Inter-Oceanic Railway and surreptitiously rode in his private car [a railway car] up the line 75 miles to Jalapa and back\". A purpose of the trip was to allow Butler and Fletcher to discuss the details of a future expedition into Mexico. Fletcher's plan required Butler to make his way into the country and develop a more detailed invasion plan while inside its borders. It was a spy mission and Butler was enthusiastic to get started. When Adm. Fletcher explained the plan to the commanders in Washington, DC, they agreed to it. Butler was given the go-ahead.\n\nA few days later he set out by train on his spy mission to Mexico City, with a stopover at Puebla. He made his way to the U.S. Consulate in Mexico City, posing as a railroad official named \"Mr. Johnson\".\n\nHe and the chief railroad inspector scoured the city, saying they were searching for a lost railroad employee; there was no lost employee, and in fact the employee they said was lost never existed. The ruse gave Butler access to various areas of the city. In the process of the so-called search, they located weapons in use by the Mexican army and determined the size of units and states of readiness. They updated maps and verified the railroad lines for use in an impending US invasion.\n\nOn March 7, 1914, he returned to Veracruz with the information he had gathered and presented it to his commanders. The invasion plan was eventually scrapped when authorities loyal to Mexican Gen. Victoriano Huerta detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in Tampico, Mexico, which led to what became known as the Tampico Affair.\n\nWhen President Woodrow Wilson discovered that an arms shipment was about to arrive in Mexico, he sent a contingent of Marines and sailors to Veracruz to intercept it on April 21, 1914. Over the next few days street fighting and sniper fire posed a threat to Butler's force, but a door-to-door search rooted out most of the resistance. By April 26 the landing force of 5,800 Marines and sailors secured the city, which they held for the next six months. By the end of the conflict the Americans reported 17 dead and 63 wounded and the Mexican forces had 126 dead and 195 wounded. After the actions at Veracruz, the US decided to minimize the bloodshed and changed their plans from a full invasion of Mexico to simply maintaining the city of Veracruz. For his actions on April 22, Butler was awarded his first Medal of Honor. The citation reads: \n\nAfter the occupation of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished the prestige of the award. The army presented one, nine went to Marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned to him with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.\n\nIn 1915 Haitian President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam was killed by a mob. In response, the United States ordered the to Haiti with Maj. Butler and a group of Marines on board. On October 24, 1915, an estimated 400 \"Cacos\" ambushed Butler's patrol of 44 mounted Marines when they approached Fort Dipitie. Surrounded by \"Cacos\", the Marines maintained their perimeter throughout the night. The next morning they charged the much larger enemy force by breaking out in three directions. The startled Haitians fled. In early November Butler and a force of 700 Marines and sailors returned to the mountains to clear the area. At their temporary headquarters base at Le Trou they fought off an attack by about 100 \"Cacos\". After the Americans took several other forts and ramparts during the following days, only Fort Rivière, an old French-built stronghold atop Montagne Noire, was left.\n\nFor the operation Butler was given three companies of Marines and some sailors from the USS \"Connecticut\", about 100 men. They encircled the fort and gradually closed in on it. Butler reached the fort from the southern side with the 15th Company and found a small opening in the wall. The Marines entered through the opening and engaged the \"Cacos\" in hand-to-hand combat. Butler and the Marines took the rebel stronghold on November 17, an action for which he received his second Medal of Honor, as well as the Haitian Medal of Honor. The entire battle lasted less than 20 minutes. Only one Marine was injured in the assault when he was struck by a rock and lost two teeth. All 51 Haitians in the Fort were killed. Butler's exploits impressed Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, who recommended the award based upon Butler's performance during the engagement. Once the medal was approved and presented in 1917, Butler achieved the distinction, shared with Dan Daly, of being the only Marines to receive the Medal of Honor twice for separate actions. The citation reads: \n\nSubsequently, as the initial organizer and commanding officer of the Gendarmerie d'Haïti, the native police force, Butler established a record as a capable administrator. Under his supervision social order, administered by the dictatorship, was largely restored and many vital public works projects were successfully completed. He recalled later that, during his time in Haiti, he and his troops \"hunted the \"Cacos\" like pigs.\"\n\nDuring World War I Butler was, to his disappointment, not assigned to a combat command on the Western Front. He made several requests for a posting in France, writing letters to his personal friend, Wendell Cushing Neville. While Butler's superiors considered him brave and brilliant, they described him as \"unreliable.\"\n\nIn October 1918 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general at the age of 37 and placed in command of Camp Pontanezen at Brest, France, a debarkation depot that funneled troops of the American Expeditionary Force to the battlefields. The camp had been unsanitary, overcrowded and disorganized. U.S. Secretary of War Newton Baker sent novelist Mary Roberts Rinehart to report on the camp. She later described how Butler tackled the sanitation problems. He began by solving the problem of mud: \"[T]he ground under the tents was nothing but mud, [so] he had raided the wharf at Brest of the duckboards no longer needed for the trenches, carted the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on.\" Gen. John J. Pershing authorized a duckboard shoulder patch for the units. This earned Butler another nickname, \"Old Duckboard.\" For his exemplary service he was awarded both the Army Distinguished Service Medal and Navy Distinguished Service Medal and the French Order of the Black Star. The citation for the Army Distinguished Service Medal states: The citation for the Navy Distinguished Service Medal states: \nFollowing the war, he became Commanding General of the Marine Barracks at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. At Quantico he transformed the wartime training camp into a permanent Marine post. During a training exercise in western Virginia in 1921, he was told by a local farmer that Stonewall Jackson's arm was buried nearby, to which he replied, \"Bosh! I will take a squad of Marines and dig up that spot to prove you wrong!\" Butler found the arm in a box. He later replaced the wooden box with a metal one, and reburied the arm. He left a plaque on the granite monument marking the burial place of Jackson's arm; the plaque is no longer on the marker but can be viewed at the Chancellorsville Battlefield visitor's center.\n\nFrom 1927-29 Butler was commander of the Marine Expeditionary Force in China and, while there, cleverly parlayed his influence among various generals and warlords to the protection of U.S. interests, ultimately winning the public acclaim of contending Chinese leaders. When he returned to the United States in 1929 he was promoted to major general, becoming, at age 48, the youngest major general of the Marine Corps. He directed the Quantico camp's growth until it became the \"showplace\" of the Corps. Butler won national attention by taking thousands of his men on long field marches, many of which he led from the front, to Gettysburg and other Civil War battle sites, where they conducted large-scale re-enactments before crowds of distinguished spectators.\n\nIn 1931 Butler violated diplomatic norms by publicly recounting gossip about Benito Mussolini in which the dictator allegedly struck and killed a child with his speeding automobile in a hit-and-run accident. The Italian government protested and President Hoover, who strongly disliked Butler, forced Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III to court-martial him. Butler became the first general officer to be placed under arrest since the Civil War. He apologized to Secretary Adams and the court-martial was canceled with only a reprimand.\n\nAt the urging of Butler's father, in 1924 newly elected mayor of Philadelphia W. Freeland Kendrick asked him to leave the Marines to become the city's Director of Public Safety, the official in charge of running the city's police and fire departments. Philadelphia's municipal government was notoriously corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge. He replaced corrupt police officers and, in some cases, switched entire units from one part of the city to another, undermining local protection rackets and profiteering.\n\nWithin 48 hours of taking over Butler organized raids on more than 900 speakeasies, ordering them padlocked and, in many cases, destroyed. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the Ritz-Carlton and the Union League, as well as on drinking establishments that served the working class. Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, \"I don't believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman's guns in this city; go out and get some.\" Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, they continued for several weeks.\n\nHe implemented programs to improve city safety and security. He established policies and guidelines of administration and developed a Philadelphia police uniform that resembled that of the Marine Corps. Other changes included military-style checkpoints into the city, bandit-chasing squads armed with sawed-off shotguns and armored police cars. The press began reporting on the good and the bad aspects of Butler's personal war on crime. The reports praised the new uniforms, the new programs and the reductions in crime but they also reflected the public's negative opinion of their new Public Safety Director. Many felt that he was being too aggressive in his tactics and resented the reductions in their civil rights, such as the stopping of citizens at the city checkpoints. Butler frequently swore in his radio addresses, causing many citizens to suggest his behavior, particularly his language, was inappropriate for someone of his rank and stature. Some even suggested Butler acted like a military dictator, even charging that he wrongfully used active-duty Marines in some of his raids. Maj. R.A. Haynes, the federal Prohibition commissioner, visited the city in 1924, six months after Butler was appointed. He announced that \"great progress\" had been made in the city and attributed that success to Butler.\n\nEventually Butler's leadership style and the directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, \"I had the guts to bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him.\" Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted Gen. Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to leak that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.\n\nButler devoted much of his second year to executing arrest warrants, cracking down on crooked police and enforcing prohibition. On January 1, 1926, his leave from the Marine Corps ended and the President declined a request for a second extension. Butler received orders to report to San Diego and prepared his family and his belongings for the new assignment. In light of his pending departure, he began to defy the mayor and other key city officials. On the eve of his departure, he had an article printed in the paper stating his intention to stay and \"finish the job\". The mayor was surprised and furious when he read the press release the next morning and demanded his resignation. After almost two years in office, Butler resigned under pressure, stating later that \"cleaning up Philadelphia was worse than any battle I was ever in.\"\n\nWhen Commandant of the Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Neville died July 8, 1930, Butler, at that time the senior major general in the Corps, was a candidate for the position. Although he had significant support from many inside and outside the Corps, including John Lejeune and Josephus Daniels, two other Marine Corps generals were seriously considered--Ben H. Fuller and John H. Russell Jr.. Lejeune and others petitioned President Herbert Hoover, garnered support in the Senate and flooded Secretary of the Navy Charles Adams' desk with more than 2,500 letters of support. With the recent death of his influential father, however, Butler had lost much of his protection from his civilian superiors. The outspokenness that characterized his run-ins with the Mayor of Philadelphia, the \"unreliability\" mentioned by his superiors when opposing a posting to the Western Front and his comments about Benito Mussolini resurfaced. In the end the position of Commandant went to Fuller, who had more years of commissioned service than Butler and was considered less controversial. Butler requested retirement and left active duty on October 1, 1931.\n\nEven before retiring from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931 he took part in a commission established by Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier which laid the foundations for the Oregon State Police. He began lecturing at events and conferences, and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931 he took this up full-time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter's marriage to Marine aviator Lt. John Wehle. Her wedding was the only time he wore his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.\nButler announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania in March 1932 as a proponent of Prohibition, known as a \"dry\". Butler allied with Gifford Pinchot but was defeated in the April 26, 1932, primary election with only 37.5% of the vote to incumbent Sen. James J. Davis' 60%. A third candidate received the remainder of the votes. According to biographer Mark Strecker, Butler voted for Norman Thomas of the Socialist Party for president in 1936.\n\nDuring his Senate campaign, Butler spoke out forcefully about the veterans bonus. Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression, sought immediate cash payment of Service Certificates granted to them eight years earlier via the World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924. Each Service Certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment, plus compound interest. The problem was that the certificates (like bonds), matured 20 years from the date of original issuance, thus, under extant law, the Service Certificates could not be redeemed until 1945. In June 1932, approximately 43,000 marchers—17,000 of whom were World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups—protested in Washington, D.C. The Bonus Expeditionary Force, also known as the \"Bonus Army\", marched on Washington to advocate the passage of the \"soldier's bonus\" for service during World War I. After Congress adjourned, bonus marchers remained in the city and became unruly. On July 28, 1932, two bonus marchers were shot by police, causing the entire mob to become hostile and riotous. The FBI, then known as the United States Bureau of Investigation, checked its fingerprint records to obtain the police records of individuals who had been arrested during the riots or who had participated in the bonus march.\n\nThe veterans made camp in the Anacostia flats while they awaited the congressional decision on whether or not to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to do anything that would cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a \"Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican\".\n\nHe became widely known for his outspoken lectures against war profiteering, U.S. military adventurism, and what he viewed as nascent fascism in the United States.\n\nIn December 1933, Butler toured the country with James E. Van Zandt to recruit members for the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). He described their effort as \"trying to educate the soldiers out of the sucker class.\" In his speeches he denounced the Economy Act of 1933, called on veterans to organize politically to win their benefits, and condemned the FDR administration for its ties to big business. The VFW reprinted one of his speeches with the title \"You Got to Get Mad\" in its magazine \"Foreign Service\". He said: \"I believe in...taking Wall St. by the throat and shaking it up.\" He believed the rival veterans' group the American Legion was controlled by banking interests. On December 8, 1933, he said: \"I have never known one leader of the American Legion who had never sold them out—and I mean it.\"\n\nIn addition to his speeches to pacifist groups, he served from 1935 to 1937 as a spokesman for the American League Against War and Fascism. In 1935, he wrote the exposé \"War Is a Racket\", a trenchant condemnation of the profit motive behind warfare. His views on the subject are summarized in the following passage from the November 1935 issue of the socialist magazine \"Common Sense\":\n\nIn November 1934, Butler claimed the existence of a political conspiracy by business leaders to overthrow President Roosevelt, a series of allegations that came to be known in the media as the Business Plot. A special committee of the House of Representatives headed by Representatives John W. McCormack of Massachusetts and Samuel Dickstein of New York, who was later alleged to have been a paid agent of the NKVD, heard his testimony in secret. The McCormack–Dickstein committee was a precursor to the House Committee on Un-American Activities.\n\nIn November 1934, Butler told the committee that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him that a group of businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The \"New York Times\" reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.\n\nIn its report to the House, the committee stated that, while \"no evidence was presented... to show a connection... with any fascist activity of any European country... [t]here was no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution...\" and that \"your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement about the creation of the organisation. This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark...\"\n\nNo prosecutions or further investigations followed, and historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually contemplated. Historians have not reported any independent evidence apart from Butler's report on what MacGuire told him. One of these, Hans Schmidt, says MacGuire was an \"inconsequential trickster\". The news media dismissed the plot, with a \"New York Times\" editorial characterizing it as a \"gigantic hoax\". When the committee's final report was released, the \"Times\" said the committee \"purported to report that a two-month investigation had convinced it that General Butler's story of a Fascist march on Washington was alarmingly true\" and \"... also alleged that definite proof had been found that the much publicized Fascist march on Washington, which was to have been led by Major Gen. Smedley D. Butler, retired, according to testimony at a hearing, was actually contemplated\". The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot, despite evidence to the contrary. Though the media ridiculed the allegations, a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's statements.\n\nThe McCormack–Dickstein Committee said of Butler's testimony in its final report, \"In the last few weeks of the committee's official life it received evidence showing that certain persons had made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country... There is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient.\"\n\nUpon his retirement, Butler bought a home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where he lived with his wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the hospital after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it from the window. He never had a chance to drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.\n\nThe funeral was held at his home, attended by friends and family as well as several politicians, members of the Philadelphia police force and officers of the Marine Corps. He was buried at Oaklands Cemetery near West Chester, Pennsylvania. Since his death in 1940, his family has maintained his home as it was when he died, including a large quantity of memorabilia he had collected throughout his varied career.\n\nIn addition to the Medal of Honor and his other American military decorations, Butler received several awards from other countries including the Haitian Médaille militaire and the French Order of the Black Star.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a student of Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald in the 1950s, Jacob claimed to have discovered and studied numerous specimens of \"Homo erectus\". He came to international prominence as a vocal critic of scientists who believed remains discovered in Flores belonged to a new species in the genus \"Homo\", \"Homo floresiensis\". \n\nJacob studied at Gadjah Mada University's School of Medicine from 1950 to 1956; University of Arizona from 1957 to 1958; Howard University from 1958 to 1960, and finally Utrecht University, where he completed his doctorate in anthropology in 1967. As a young adult, Jacob actively participated in the Indonesian National Revolution, producing a nationalist radio program. Following the Japanese occupation of Indonesia during World War II, Jacob served in the Indonesian armed forces. From 1982 to 1987, Jacob was also a member of the People's Consultative Assembly. \n\nJacob died in Dr. Sardjito Hospital at the age of 77 after suffering from a debilitating liver disease.\n\nJacob came to international prominence when he expressed his disagreement with scientists who claimed that remains found on the island of Flores constituted a new human species, labeled \"Homo floresiensis\". Jacob insisted that the remains were those of microcephalic modern humans. In early December 2004, Jacob removed most of the remains from Soejono's institution, Jakarta's National Research Centre of Archaeology, for his own research without the permission of the Centre's directors. \n\nJacob eventually returned the remains with portions severely damaged and missing two leg bones on February 23, 2005. Reports noted the condition of the returned remains included \"long, deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit's jaw on both sides, said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould\"; \"the chin of a second Hobbit snapped off and glued back together. Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle\"; and, \"The pelvis was smashed, destroying details that reveal body shape, gait and evolutionary history\". This prompted the discovery team leader Morwood to remark \"It's sickening, Jacob was greedy and acted totally irresponsibly\".\n\nJacob, however, denied any wrongdoing. He stated that such damage occurred during transport from Yogyakarta back to Jakarta despite the physical evidence to the contrary that the jawbone had been broken while making a mold of bones.\n\nIn 2005 Indonesian officials forbade access to the cave and thus no other excavations in the place were possible. The BBC expressed the opinion that the reason for the restriction was to protect Jacob from being proven wrong. Scientists were allowed to return to the cave in 2007, the same year that Jacob died from liver disease.\n"}

After the submission of his dissertation to Antal Festetics at the forestal faculty of the University of Göttingen in 1998, he was the chairperson of the \"Gesellschaft für Wildökologie und Naturschutz e.V.\" (\"Society for wildlife ecology and conservation e.V.\"). In this role, he appeared in the media as expert for the increasing urbanisation of animals. At the moment (July 2008), he works for the \"Forschungsanstalt für Waldökologie und Forstwirtschaft Rheinland-Pfalz\" (\"Research institute for forest ecology and forestry Rhineland-Palatinate\") located in Trippstadt.\n\nWithin the scope of his dissertation, Ulf Hohmann and several scientific assistants carried out the first systematic study of the German raccoon population from 1992 to 1998. The telemetric measurement of the movement patterns of the raccoons living in the Lower Saxony low mountain range Solling yielded the result that the social behavior of raccoons is gender-specific and that they often live together in small, loose groups instead of being loners like previously thought. Stanley D. Gehrt arrived at the same conclusion in his study done in Texas in 1994 one year after Hohmann's initial query to Gehrt's doctoral adviser and raccoon expert Erik Fritzell about his discoveries. (→ Social behavior of raccoons)\n\nThe study was supplemented with the observation of the behavior of several raised and subsequently released raccoon kits. This work, started by the graduand Franziska Kalz in 1995, was accompanied by the wildlife photographer Ingo Bartussek since spring 1996. Beginning in 1999, after the submission of his dissertation, Ulf Hohmann carried out the first study of urban raccoons outside of North America in the Hessian small town Bad Karlshafen. In 2001, Ulf Hohmann published the monograph \"Der Waschbär\" (\"The raccoon\"), giving a thorough overview of appearance and behavior of the species and the results of his studies in it. Besides numerous photos of Ingo Bartussek, the book also contains a chapter about raising raccoon kits written by the veterinarian Bernhard Böer.\n\nWorking now for the \"Forschungsanstalt für Waldökologie und Forstwirtschaft Rheinland-Pfalz\", Ulf Hohmann has recently concentrated on the research of boars, mainly of those living in the Palatinate Forest. His research on raccoons has been continued by Frank-Uwe Michler, who first worked together with Hohmann for his diploma in a study of urban raccoons in Kassel from 2001 to 2002. Since March 2006, Frank-Uwe Michler is the leader of the first study of the range and behavior of the raccoons living in the eastern parts of Germany in the Müritz National Park.\n\n"}
