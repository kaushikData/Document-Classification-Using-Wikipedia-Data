He was one of the last of the old-style Camorra godfathers.\n\nOriginally from San Cipriano d'Aversa in the Italian province of Caserta, Bardellino was an important \"Cosa Nostra\" affiliate in the region of Campania. \"Bardellino was the reference point of all Camorra clans, even the ones that could not stand him. With his charisma he managed to maintain a certain equilibrium in Campania\", according to the \"pentito\" Pasquale Galasso. He was the founder of the Casalesi clan, around which for almost a decade moved a united confederation of families (Schiavone, Bidognetti, Zagaria, Iovine, Venosa) rooted in a large territory which extended from southern Lazio through the \"agro aversano\" (countryside near Aversa), to Naples.\n\nBardellino had close and powerful contacts within the Sicilian Mafia, initially with the Porta Nuova family of Pippo Calò. He was one of the few Camorra bosses who were also initiated into \"Cosa Nostra\". Together with Lorenzo Nuvoletta and Michele Zaza, he was sworn in to seal a pact on cigarette smuggling in 1975.\n\nIn contrast to the Nuvoletta brothers, who were allied with the Corleonesi headed by Luciano Leggio and Salvatore Riina, Bardellino was allied with Rosario Riccobono, Stefano Bontade, Gaetano Badalamenti, and Tommaso Buscetta, all heads of fallen Palermo families which were defeated by the Corleonesi in the Second Mafia War and forced to flee.\n\nIt is believed that Bardellino was the initiator of the Casalesi clan in the area of Casal di Principe and San Cipriano d'Aversa, especially due to the transformation he implemented within the clan. The rituals of affiliation remained as well as the rate of murders, but the leap in quality was the continued infiltration of the legitimate economy with the proceeds of illicit drug trafficking. This was favoured by the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and the subsequent reconstruction, which prompted the families to create a consortium for their companies that performed the work of earth-moving and construction. Another factor was the great entrepreneurial ability of Bardellino himself. He owned an fish flour import-export business together with other clans, which in fact covered up a Brazilian cocaine smuggling operation. Besides trafficking cocaine, he was involved in the heroin trade with Lorenzo Nuvoletta and Ciro Mazzarella, supplying the Sicilian Mafia.\n\nIn the 1980s, Bardellino realized that cocaine, not heroin, would become the more profitable drug and organized a trafficking operation smuggling it from Latin America to Aversa via his front business. Heroin was smuggled as well, and shipments to the Gambino crime family were concealed inside espresso filters. When one shipment was intercepted by the authorities, Bardellino reportedly called John Gotti and told him; \"Don't worry, now we're sending twice as much the other way\".\n\nBardellino was the main exponent of the Nuova Famiglia (NF), a confederation of clans that was formed to contrast the growing power of the predominant Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO), led by Raffaele Cutolo. The NF consisted of Bardellino, Michele Zaza (a Camorra boss with strong ties with Cosa Nostra), the Gionta clan (from Torre Annunziata), the Nuvoletta clan from Marano, the Alfieri clan of Saviano led by Carmine Alfieri, the Galasso clan of Poggiomarino (led by Pasquale Galasso), the Giuliano clan from Naples' quarter Forcella (led by Luigi Giuliano and the Vollaro clan from Portici (led by Luigi Vollaro).\n\nThe resulting war between the NF and the NCO resulted in a large number of victims from both sides, and ended with the NCO's defeat and the victory of the NF. However, with Cutolo and the NCO out of the picture, the NF alliance soon disintegrated, with a war breaking out between the Bardellino and Nuvoletta clans towards the end of 1983.\n\nWhile the Second Mafia War between the Corleonesi and the Bontade-Buscetta-Inzerillo-Badalamenti faction was being fought in Sicily, its effects were being felt on the Campanian underworld. The Corleonesi boss, Salvatore Riina, mandated Lorenzo Nuvoletta to order the murder of Tommaso Buscetta. Nuvoletta, in turn, passed the order to Bardellino. The order was not brought to an end, because Bardellino had been good friends with Buscetta in Sicily, and had once shared the same house with Buscetta in Brazil when the latter was absconding. He also deeply distrusted the Nuvolettas and was unwilling to accept the supremacy of the Nuvoletta brothers with the interference of the Corleonesi. Bardellino's attitude soon marked him for death, and he would spend the last years of life in hiding outside Italy, including Spain, Brazil and Santo Domingo.\n\nTowards the end of 1982, thanks to a tip off from the local police, Antonio Bardellino managed to evade capture in his Rio de Janeiro apartment. Despite this setback, a meeting was soon arranged between Bardellino and the Nuvolettas in Zurich, but Aniello Nuvoletta was arrested at the rendezvous. Many other leaders of the Nuvoletta clan would have been arrested had they not suffered a chance accident in northern Italy, near the Swiss border. Bardellino was arrested in Barcelona in Spain in November 1983, but he was inexplicably released on bail and disappeared soon afterwards.\n\nThe clash with the Nuvoletta clan resulted in Bardellino's victory. An attack was made at the Nuvoletta family's farm in Marano which resulted in the death of Ciro Nuvoletta, one of the brothers. Two months later, events culminated with an attack at Torre Annunziata, an area infamous for its illegal activities, which led to the massacre of eight members of the Gionta clan allied with the Nuvolettas at the Circolo dei Pescatori (fisherman's club). Another twenty four were wounded. This episode was known as the Torre Annunziata massacre in the local press, and is perhaps the worst gangland massacre to ever take place in Italy.\n\nThis victory further allowed Antonio Bardellino to expand his sphere of control and influence to include almost the entire province of Caserta and Naples. In spite of being a fugitive sought by Interpol, Bardellino could exercise his power and coordinate criminal activities unhindered, but the disagreements came with the Casalesi itself.\n\nAccording to the official version of the story, on May 26, 1988, Antonio Bardellino was murdered by his right-hand man, Mario Iovine in his Brazilian home at Búzios, a beach side resort for the rich and famous in the State of Rio de Janeiro, as part of an internal feud within the Casalesi. However, this story has never been verified because his body was never found and the alleged assassin, Iovine, was himself murdered in Portugal in 1991 while using a phone booth. These circumstances have fuelled a legend that Bardellino is still alive, and has left power in the hands of the other families within the Casalesi clan in order to ensure the survival of his family.\n\nWhen his old friend, Tommaso Buscetta who later became a \"pentito\" was asked about the status of Bardellino during a testimony before the Antimafia Commission, he replied: \"Is it already obvious that Bardellino died? I do not know, but I do not believe that he is dead.\" After the news of Bardellino's death spread, his family left their homes and native areas to take refuge in Formia where they still reside. After the disappearance of Antonio Bardellino, the five families (Schiavone, Iovine, Bidognetti, De Falco and Zagaria) took control, each with their own army.\n\nHis former ally Umberto Ammaturo, who turned state witness (pentito), also said Bardellino was still alive when he gave a rare interview to La Repubblica newspaper in May 2010.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11836806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11836806", "title": "Book of Mormon witnesses", "text": "Book of Mormon witnesses\n\nThe Book of Mormon witnesses are a group of contemporaries of Joseph Smith who saw the golden plates from which Smith translated the Book of Mormon. The most significant witnesses are the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses, all of whom allowed their names to be used on two separate statements included with the Book of Mormon. Each of the witnesses never denied what they saw.\n\nThe Three Witnesses were a group of three early leaders of the Latter Day Saint movement who wrote in a statement of 1830 that an angel had shown them the golden plates from which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon and that they had heard God's voice testifying that the book had been translated by the power of God.\n\nThe Three Witnesses were Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and David Whitmer, whose joint testimony, in conjunction with a separate statement by Eight Witnesses, has been printed with nearly every edition of the Book of Mormon since its first publication in 1830. All three witnesses eventually broke with Smith and were excommunicated from the church. In 1838, Joseph Smith called Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer \"too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them.\" In 1839 Cowdery published a tract rejecting the Latter Day Saints and in 1840 become a member of the Methodist Protestant Church. In later years, all three testified to the divine origin of the Book of Mormon, and near the end of their lives rejoined one denomination or another of the Latter Day Saint movement. Harris and Cowdery rejoined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shortly before their deaths, and Whitmer founded the Church of Christ (Whitmerite).\n\nThe Eight Witnesses were the second of the two groups of \"special witnesses\" to the Book of Mormon's golden plates. They were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Jr., John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith, Sr., Hyrum Smith, and Samuel Harrison Smith. Joseph Smith Sr. was Joseph's father, and Hyrum and Samuel H. Smith were his brothers. Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were David Whitmer's brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.\n\nUnlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified they were shown the plates by Joseph Smith rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses. Christian Whitmer died in 1835 and his brother Peter Whitmer, Jr. died the following year. In 1838, the surviving Whitmers became estranged from Joseph Smith during a leadership struggle in Far West, Missouri, and all were excommunicated with other dissenters, never to rejoin Smith's church. None of the Eight Witnesses is known to have denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the golden plates.\nMary Musselman Whitmer (1778–1856), the mother of five Witnesses who took care of the household in Fayette, New York, where much of the translation occurred, said that an angel showed her the plates and thus made her more content to continue her daily labors. Joseph Smith made no mention of this visitation in his journal.\n\nCritics of the Latter Day Saint movement—from late nineteenth-century clergymen to Mark Twain to modern agnostics, evangelical Christians, and even some unorthodox (\"Big Tent\") Mormons—argue that the testimonies of the witnesses cannot be taken at face value.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2289104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289104", "title": "Charles-François Galand", "text": "Charles-François Galand\n\nCharles-François Galand (1832–1900) was a French gunsmith who worked in Liege and Paris, France. He manufactured many revolvers for civilian and military use, including the Galand Revolver (also called the Galand-Sommerville or Galand-Perrin), the Tue Tue, and the tiny Le Novo. The Velo-dog, developed from the Tue Tue and the Novo, was designed by Charles-François' son René in 1904.\n\nThe original Galand revolver was a double-action, open frame (no strap across the top of the cylinder) revolver patented in 1868. Military versions were produced in 9 mm while civilian versions were made in 12 mm. The gun is easily recognizable due to its long extraction lever, which stretches under the gun to form the trigger guard. Pulling the lever forward separates the barrel and cylinder from the rest of the gun. At the same time the extractor plate is blocked which catches any cartridges in the cylinder, thereby extracting them.\n\nThe first model was manufactured both in Liege and in Birmingham, England by the British arms firm Braendlin and Sommerville, and is therefore sometimes referred to as the Galand-Sommerville. Sommerville shared the patent for the case extracting system with Galand. The Galand-Perrin is an identical model which uses the Perrin cartridge (7 mm, 9 mm, and most famously 12 mm).\n\nThe Galand's double-action mechanism allowed for rapid firing but the longer trigger pull made this less accurate than single-action fire. The Galand's self-extracting system made loading the revolver much faster than contemporary gate-loaded pistols such as the Colt Peacemaker.\n\nFirst distributed in October 1868, the Galand revolver sold briskly in France, at least in part due to fears over the looming Franco-Prussian War of 1870.\n\nDespite France's loss to the Germans the Galand performed successfully and the Imperial Russian Navy adopted the Galand model 1870 revolver in 1871. This revolver was manufactured under contract by Nagant and Goltiakoff in Russia in 1878. The Romanian Army also adopted the Galand.\n\nIn 1872 Galand improved the design with a closed frame, but failed to win a French military contract and began aiming most of his production at the civilian market. In 1893 Galand introduced the 8 mm Tue Tue (kill kill) hammerless pocket revolver, which continued in production until about 1935. Later versions were also sold in .32 S&W and .38 ACP, and some had an external hammer. The tiny Le Novo revolver, with a hinged trigger and no trigger guard, also featured a folding grip.\n\nAfter Charles-François Galand's death in 1900 his son, René, continued the business until 1942. He created the Velo-dog, a truly peculiar conceit in personal defence weapons. The name is a contraction of \"vélocipède\" (bicycle) and dog. The weapon was originally marketed as a defence for bicyclists during the bicycle craze which started at the end of the 19th century. Like the Le Novo the Velodog originally used a 5.5 mm center fire cartridge; it was also available in .22 caliber and 6.35 mm.\n\n"}

They were most prominent in areas of England and continental Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries.\n\nThose employed for the position were given a three-foot-long whip and a pair of dog tongs with which to remove the animals. They were given the task of keeping stray animals away from the church and preventing communion bread and priests from being assaulted. The whip was utilized both for enforcement and as a deterrent while the tongs enabled the whipper to clasp a problematic animal from a safe distance.\n\nIt was not uncommon for household dogs to accompany — or at least follow — their owners to church services at this time. If at any point they became loud, fought with other animals, attacked congregation members, or were otherwise disruptive, it was the job of the dog whipper to remove them from the church as well to allow the service to continue in peace.\n\nDog whippers were generally paid for their services, and records of payments to the local dog whipper exist in old parish account books in many English churches. In some areas a portion of village land was made available for the use of the dog whipper, the small park named 'Dog Acre' in Birchington-on-Sea is the remnant of such a grant.\n\nSome villages employed dog whippers in a more general capacity, dealing with stray and disruptive dogs throughout the village. In this sense dog whippers were precursors of modern animal control officers, much like church 'bang beggars' were to today's police officer. In addition, churches that found their coffers lacking had the option of hiring out their services or giving their staff other tasks to complete. The role was similar to the 'Sluggard Waker' that entailed poking or hitting drowsy members of the congregation on the head with a long, outfitted pole.\n\nDog whippers became less common from the late 18th century onwards, presumably because animals were increasingly unwelcome at church services. One of the last recorded dog whippers to perform the original function was one John Pickard, who was appointed to Exeter Cathedral in 1856. A small room in Exeter Cathedral is still known as the Dog Whipper's Room. Exeter still has a Dog Whipper, now a purely ceremonial role, for processions and other significant occasions. \n\nA dog whipper's whip survives in St. Anne's Church, Baslow, Derbyshire and a dog whipper's pew is preserved in St. Margaret's Church in Wrenbury, Cheshire. A notable carving of a dog whipper removing a dog with his whip can be seen in the Great Church of St. Bavo in Haarlem.\n\nWith the advent of animal shelters, this job became largely obsolete.\n\n\n"}

He trained several animals for movies, including the dogs in the Benji series and the cat Orangey. He also trained the dog in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.\n\nElias Franklin Freeman was born in Camby, Indiana, to a Quaker family. He left home at age 17, changed his name to Frank Inn, and sought his fortune in Hollywood. He learned to train animals while recovering from a serious automobile accident in Culver City, California.\n\nInn was married to the former Juanita Heard for 50 years, from 1946 until her death in 1996. They had three children. After Juanita's death, Inn retired and devoted his time to writing poetry, assembling a museum of memorabilia from his long career, and training a new generation of animal wranglers.\n\nInn died on July 27th, 2002 at the age of 86 after a brief illness. He kept the ashes of many of his beloved animals after they had died, and it was his wish to have these buried with him at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills). He had a special coffin made to accommodate the animal urns. Unable to be interred with him, the animal ashes remain with his daughters.\n\nInn's career as an animal trainer spanned more than 50 years. His first professional work was as an assistant trainer of Skippy, the dog who played Asta in the \"Thin Man\" movie series.\n\nIn 1943, he assisted Rudd Weatherwax in the training of Pal, the dog who originated the movie role of Lassie. \n\nIn the early 1950s, Inn left the Weatherwax animal training organization and began to work as an independent trainer. His animal stars included Orangey, a cat who was in the films \"Rhubarb\" (1952), \"The Incredible Shrinking Man\" (1957), \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" (1959), and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961), and appeared in the television series \"Our Miss Brooks\" with Eve Arden; Cleo, a basset hound who was in the film \"Bell, Book and Candle\" (1957) and in Jackie Cooper's 1950s television show, \"The People's Choice\"; Arnold Ziffel, the pig from \"Green Acres\"; the chimps from \"Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp\", the dog and two cats from \"The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty\", Tramp the dog of \"My Three Sons\" and many of Elly May Clampett's exotic \"critters\" on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\".\n\nPossibly his most famous animal was Higgins, a fluffy brown mutt he rescued from an animal shelter in Burbank, California. The dog, which Inn believed to be a cross between a miniature poodle, a cocker spaniel, and a small terrier (either a miniature Schnauzer or a Border terrier), starred in \"Petticoat Junction\" in the 1960s, and in the feature films \"Mooch Goes to Hollywood\" (1971) and \"Benji\" (1974). A sequel, \"For the Love of Benji\" (1977), starred Higgins's daughter Benjean, also trained by Inn. Benjean portrayed the title role in the following three Benji movies.\n\nIn addition to his assistant trainers Gerry Warshauer and Karl Miller, Juanita Inn also helped Frank with animal training; she was listed in the opening credits of \"Benji\" and given credit as an animal trainer in \"Oh! Heavenly Dog\", a 1980 movie starring Benjean.\n\nFrank Inn also took on small character roles in films that featured his trained animals. He portrayed a studio security guard (uncredited) in \"Mooch Goes to Hollywood\" in 1971, appeared as himself in \"Benji the Hunted\" in 1987, and played a cook in the 1976 camel comedy \"Hawmps!\". He can also be seen working as Benjean's trainer in the 1980 documentary \"Benji at Work\", and the voice of Juanita Inn can be heard calling Benjean from off-camera during the behind-the-scenes description of a complex multi-part stunt that required the dog to approach a building, try to enter, and then run away as if driven off.\n\nA true animal lover, Inn could not bear to see healthy animals euthanized, so he took them in. Those with acting ability he and his assistants kept and trained; the others he gave to friends and admirers as pets. Inn said that at one time he and his helpers had one thousand animals under their care, and the feeding bills alone came to $400 per day.\n\nThe International Association of Canine Professionals honored Frank Inn as their first inductee into the IACP Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Patsy Award (Picture Animal Top Star of the Year) was originated by the Hollywood office of the American Humane Association in 1939 to honor animal performers in four categories: canine, equine, wild and special. During his career, Inn's animals won 40 Patsy Awards, two of them multiple times: Orangey the cat won three times, for \"Rhubarb,\" \"The Incredible Shrinking Man,\" and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\"; and Arnold the Pig won for three successive years on \"Green Acres\" from 1966 to 1968.\n\n"}
{"id": "476217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476217", "title": "Guerrilla Girls", "text": "Guerrilla Girls\n\nGuerrilla Girls is an anonymous group of feminist, female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world. The group formed in New York City in 1985 with the mission of bringing gender and racial inequality into focus within the greater arts community. The group employs culture jamming in the form of posters, books, billboards, and public appearances to expose discrimination and corruption. To remain anonymous, members don gorilla masks and use pseudonyms that refer to deceased female artists. According to GG1, identities are concealed because issues matter more than individual identities, \"[M]ainly, we wanted the focus to be on the issues, not on our personalities or our own work.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1985, seven women launched the Guerrilla Girls in response to the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition \"An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture\" [1984), whose roster of 165 artists included only 13 women. Inaugurating MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, this exhibition claimed to survey that era's most important painters and sculptors from 17 countries. The proportion of artists of color was even smaller, and none of them were women. \nA comment by the show's curator, Kynaston McShine, further highlights that era's explicit art world gender bias: \"Kynaston McShine gave interviews saying that any artist who wasn't in the show should rethink his career.\" In reaction to the exhibition and McShine's overt bias, they protested in front of MoMA. Thus, the Guerrilla Girls were born.\n\nWhen the protests yielded little success, the Guerrilla Girls wheat-pasted posters throughout downtown Manhattan, particularly in the SoHo and East Village neighborhoods.\n\nSoon after, the group expanded their focus to include racism in the art world, attracting artists of color. They also took on projects outside of New York, enabling them to address sexism and racism nationally and internationally. Though the art world has remained the group's main focus, the Guerrilla Girls' agenda has included sexism and racism in films, mass and popular culture, and politics. Tokenism also represents a major group concern.\n\nDuring its first years, the Guerrilla Girls conducted \"weenie counts,\" such that members visited institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and counted artworks' male-to-female subject ratios. Data gathered from the Met's public collections in 1989 showed that women artists had produced less than 5% of the works in the Modern Art Department, while 85% of the nudes were female.\nEarly organizing was based around meetings, during which members evaluated statistical data gathered regarding gender inequality within the New York City's art scene. The Guerrilla Girls also worked closely with artists, encouraging them to speak to those within the community to bridge the gender gap where they perceived it.\n\nWhen asked about the masks, the girls answer \"We were Guerrillas before we were Gorillas. From the beginning the press wanted publicity photos. We needed a disguise. No one remembers, for sure, how we got our fur, but one story is that at an early meeting, an original girl, a bad speller, wrote 'Gorilla' instead of 'Guerrilla.' It was an enlightened mistake. It gave us our 'mask-ulinity.'\" In an interview with New York Times the Guerrilla Girls were quoted, \"Anonymous free speech is protected by the Constitution. You'd be surprised what comes out of your mouth when you wear a mask.\"\n\nSince 1985, the Guerrilla Girls have worked for an increased awareness of sexism and greater accountability on the part of curators, art dealers, collectors and critics. The group is credited, above all, with sparking dialogue, and bringing national and international attention to issues of sexism and racism within the arts.\n\nMany feminist artists in the 1970s dared to imagine that female artists could produce authentically and radically different art, undoing the prevailing visual paradigm. The pioneering feminist critic, Lucy Lippard curated an all-women exhibition in 1974, effectively protesting what most deemed a deeply flawed approach, that of merely assimilating women into the prevailing art system. Shaped by the 1970s women's movement, the Guerrilla Girls resolved to devise new strategies. Most noticeably, they realized that 1970s-era tools such as pickets and marches proved ineffective, as evidenced by how easily MoMA could ignore 200 protestors from the Women's Caucus for Art. \"We had to have a new image and a new kind of language to appeal to a younger generation of women,\" recalls one of the founding Guerrilla Girls, who goes by \"Liubov Popova.\" The Guerrilla Girls sought an alternative approach, one that would defeat views of the 1970s Feminist movements as man-hating, anti-maternal, strident, and humorless: Versed in poststructuralist theories, they adopted 1970s initiatives, but with a different language and style. Earlier feminists tackled grim and unfunny issues such as sexual violence, inspiring the Guerrilla Girls to keep their spirits intact by approaching their work with wit and laughter, thus preventing a backlash.\n\nThroughout their existence, the Guerrilla Girls have gained the most attention for their bold protest art.\nThe Guerrilla Girls' projects (mostly posters at first) express observations, concerns, and ideals regarding numerous social topics. Their art has always been fact-driven, and informed by the group's unique approach to data collection, such as \"weenie counts.\" To be more inclusive and to make their posters more eye-catching, the Guerrilla Girls tend to pair facts with humorous images. Although the Guerrilla Girls gained fame for wheat-pasting provocative campaign posters around New York City, the group has also enjoyed public commissions and indoor exhibitions.\n\nIn addition to posting posters around downtown Manhattan, they passed out thousands of small handbills based on their designs at various events. The first posters were mainly black and white fact-sheets, highlighting inequalities between male and female artists with regard to number of exhibitions, gallery representation and pay. Their posters revealed how sexist the art world was in comparison to other industries and to national averages. For example, in 1985 they printed a poster showing that the salary gap in the art world between men and women was starker than the United States average, proclaiming \"Women in America earn only 2/3 of what men do. Women artists earn only 1/3 of what men do.\" These early posters often targeted specific galleries and artists. Another 1985 poster listed the names of some of the most famous working artists, such as Bruce Nauman and Richard Serra. The poster asked \"What do these artists have in common?\" with the answer \"They allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10% of women or none at all.\"\nThe group were also activists for equal representation of women in institutional art, and highlighted artist Louise Bourgeois in their \"Advantages to Being a Women artist,\" poster in 1988 as one line read, \"Knowing your career might not pick up till after you're 80.\" Their pieces are also notable for their use of combative statements such as \"When racism and sexism are no longer fashionable, what will your art collection be worth?\"\"\n\nDearest Art Collector (1986)\nDearest Art Collector is a 560x430 mm screen-print on paper. This is one of thirty posters published in a portfolio entitled Guerrilla Girls Talk Back. This print is unusual in the portfolio in that it takes the form of an enlarged handwritten letter on baby pink paper. The extremely rounded cursive script crowned with a frowning flower exudes femininity, symbolizing the biting sarcasm for which the Guerrilla Girls were known for. The Guerrilla Girls sent this poster to well- known art collectors across the United States, pointing out how few works they owned by women artists. This send up of femininity is aimed at the expectation that, even when presenting a serious complaint, women should do so in a socially acceptable 'nice' way. \"We know that you feel terrible about this\" appeals to the feelings of the recipient. This piece was a commentary on how hard it is for female artists, and what lengths they must go through in order to be recognized and taken seriously. Women are constantly expected to perform a certain way and this print is the embodiment of how tumultuous it is for women all around the world to be recognized in the eyes of men with power. The group later transcribed it into other languages and sent it to collectors outside the U.S. A practical joke with serious implications, this poster is now (somewhat ironically) a collector's item.\n\nThe posters were rude; they named names and they printed statistics (and almost always cited the source of those statistics at the bottom, making them difficult to dismiss). They embarrassed people. In other words, they worked.\n\nThe Guerrilla Girls' first color poster, which remains the group's most iconic image, is the 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster, which used data from the group's first \"weenie count.\" In response to the overwhelming amount of female nudes counted in the Modern Art sections, the poster asks, sarcastically, \"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?\". Next to the text is an image of the Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres painting La Grande Odalisque, one of the most famous female nudes in Western art history, with a gorilla head placed over the original face.\n\nIn 1990, the group designed a billboard featuring the Mona Lisa that was placed along the West Side Highway supported by the New York City public art fund. For one day, New York's MTA Bus Company also displayed bus advertisements with Met. Museum poster. Stickers also became popular calling cards representative of the group.\n\nThe Guerrilla Girls infiltrated the bathrooms of the newly opened Guggenheim Soho, placing stickers regarding female inequality on the walls. \nIn 1998, Guerrilla Girls West protested at the San Jose Museum of Art, over low representation of women artists.\n\nIn addition to researching and exposing sexism in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have received commissions from numerous organizations and institutions, such as The Nation (2001), Fundación Bilbao Arte (2002), Istanbul Modern (2006) and Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art (2007). They have also partnered with Amnesty International, contributing pieces to a show under the organization's \"Protect the Human\" initiative.\n\nIn 2005, the group exhibited large-format posters \"Welcome to the Feminist Biennale\" at the Venice Biennale (the first in 110 years to be overseen by women), scrutinizing 101 years of Biennale history in terms of diversity. \"Where Are the Women Artists of Venice?\" explored the fact that most works owned by Venice's historical museums are kept in storage.\n\nSince 2005, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to produce special projects for international institutions, sometimes for the very institutions they have criticized. Offers that pose a dilemma are carefully considered, so as to avoid censure, since one way to improve institutions is to criticize them from inside.\n\nTheir 2006 poster \"The Future For Turkish Women Artists as Revealed by the Guerrilla Girls\", commissioned by Istanbul Modern, demonstrated that the status of women artists in Turkey was better than in Europe. In 2007, the Washington Post published their \"Horror on the National Mall!\", a one-page newspaper spread attacking the absence of diversity among tax-payer supported museums on the Mall in Washington, DC. During the 2007 ART-ATHINA, the Guerrilla Girls projected \"Dear Art Collector\" in Greek onto the entrance's façade. In 2015, they projected their \"Dear Art Collector\" animation onto a museum façade, taking on collectors who fail to pay employees a living wage.\nTo commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the École Polytechnique massacre, the University of Quebec commissioned their \"Troubler Le Repos\" (Disturbing The Peace) poster, whose texts addressed anti-women hate-speech since Ancient Greece to Rush Limbaugh.\n\nIn 2009, they launched \"I'm not a feminist, but If I were this is what I'd complain about ... \", an interactive graffiti wall that enables women who don't see themselves as feminists the means to target gender issues with the hope that active participation will broaden their perspectives. In 2012, this traveled to Krakòw's Art Boom Festival.\n\nIn 2012, an advertising truck towed \"Do women Have To Be Naked To Get Into Boston Museums?\" around Boston. Invited by Yoko Ono to participate in the 2013 Meltdown Festival, the Guerrilla Girls updated their 2003 \"Estrogen Bomb\" poster, which had premiered in The Village Voice in 2003.\n\nDuring Winter 2016, they participated in \"Twin City Takeover,\" art exhibitions and art projects organized by a consortium of local art organizations sited around Minneapolis and St. Paul.\n\nTo protest the dearth of female directors, the Guerrilla Girls distributed stickers during the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. The Nation invited them to \npresent \"Birth of Feminism\", which they updated and presented in 2007 as a banner outside Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts. Since 2002, Guerrilla Girls Inc. have designed and installed billboards during the Oscars that address white male dominance in the film industry, such as: \"Anatomically Correct Oscars,\" \"Even the Senate is More Progressive than Hollywood,\" \"The Birth of Feminism,\" \"Unchain the Women Directors.\"\n\nDuring the 2015 Reykjavik Arts Festival, the Guerrilla Girls displayed \"National Film Quiz\", a billboard criticizing the fact that 87% of national funding for films goes to men, despite women playing an important part of Iceland's public and private sectors. \nIn light of 2016's #Oscarssowhite campaign, the Guerrilla Girls updated the above billboards, presenting them on downtown Minneapolis streets for \"Twin City Takeover.\"\n\nAlthough the Guerrilla Girls' protest art directed at the art world remains their most well-known work, throughout their existence the group has periodically targeted politicians, specifically conservative Republicans. Those criticized have included George Bush, Newt Gingrich, and most recently Michele Bachmann. In 1991, the Artist and Homeless Collaborative invited them to work with homeless women to create posters in response to homelessness and the first Gulf War. \nBetween 1992 and 1994, Guerrilla Girl posters addressed the 1992 Presidential election, reproductive rights (done for march on Washington in 1992), gay and lesbian rights, and the LA riots. During the 2012 election, they displayed their \"Even Michele Bachman believes. ... \" on a billboard adjacent a football stadium to advertise her plan to: ban same-sex marriages, require Voter Id Checks, and spend money implementing statewide voter IDs. Their 2013 posters discussed the Homeland Terror Alert system and Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign.\n\nIn 2016, the Guerrilla Girls launched the \"President Trump Announces New Commemorative Months\" campaign in the form of stickers and posters, which they distributed during the \"Women's March on Washington\" in LA and NYC, as well as the J20 event at the Whitney Museum of Art and the Fire Fink protest at MoMA.\n\nTo shed light on inequality in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have published numerous books. In 1995, they published their first book, \"Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls,\" a compilation of 50 works plus a self-interview. In 1998, they published \"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\", a consciousness-raising comic book that sold 82,000 copies, as it explores how art history's male domination constrained several female artists' careers. In 2003, they published \"Bitches, Bimbos and Ballbreakers\", a down and dirty catalogue of \"The Top Stereotypes from Cradle to Grave.\" Offering thumbnail histories for cultural clichés ranging from \"Daddy's Girl,\" \"the Girl Next Door,\" \"the Bimbo/Dumb Blonde\" to \"the Bitch /Ballbreaker\", each is given \"trademark Guerrilla Girl treatment: pointed factoids and cool graphics.\"\n\nTheir 2004 book \"The Guerrilla Girl's Museum Activity Book\" (reissued in 2012) parodies children's museum activity books. Meant to teach children how to both appreciate and critique museums, this book provides activities that reveal the problematic aspects of museum culture and major museum collections. In 2009, they published a history of hysteria, \"The Hysterical Herstory Of Hysteria And How It Was Cured From Ancient Times Until Now\". MFC-Michèle Didier reprinted it in 2011 and 2016.\n\nAn important part of Guerrilla Girls' outreach since 1985 has been presentations and workshops at colleges, universities, art organizations and sometimes at museums. The presentations, known as \"gigs\", attract hundreds and sometimes thousands of attendees. In the gig, they play music, videos, show slides and talk about the history of their work, how it has evolved. At the end the GGs interact with audience members. New work is always included and gig material changes all the time. They have done hundreds of these events and have travelled to nearly every state as well as Europe, South America and Australia.\n\nIn recognition of their work, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to give talks at world-renowned museums, including a presentation at the MoMA's 2007 \"Feminist Futures\" Symposium. They have also been invited to speak at art schools and universities across the globe, and gave a 2010 commencement speech at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\nTo mark the 30th anniversary of the Guerrilla Girls, Matadero Madrid hosted \"Guerrilla Girls: 1985-2015,\" an exhibition featuring most of the collective's production accompanied by a series of events including a talk/performance by Guerrilla Girl members Frida Kahlo and Käthe Kollwitz. The exhibition also showed the 1992 documentary \"Guerrilla in Our Midst\" by Amy Harrison.\nThree Guerrilla Girls appeared on the Stephen Colbert show on January 14, 2016.\n\nEarly solo exhibitions included: \"The Night the Palladium Apologized\" (1985), Palladium (New York City); \"Guerrilla Girls Review the Whitney\" (1987), Clocktower PS1; and \"Guerrilla Girls\" (1995), Printed Matter, Inc\n\nCareer surveys include: \n\nOn the heels of \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" were: \n\nDespite having routinely challenged art institutions to display more artists of color, both members and critics want the Guerrilla Girls to be more diverse. Zora Neale Hurston recalls Guerrilla Girl membership as \"mostly white\" and largely mirroring the art world demographics that they critiqued. Despite sporting gorilla masks to downplay personal identity, some members attribute Guerilla Girl interests to the fact that de facto leaders \"Frida Kahlo\" and \"Kathe Kollwitz\" are both white. (\"Frida Kahlo\" has also been criticized for her appropriation of a Latina artist's name.) However, any precise information on the demographics of the Guerrilla Girls is impossible, for they have \"staunchly, and problematically, resisted being surveyed as to the makeup of their own membership.\"\n\nSeveral Guerrilla Girls who are people of color have faced numerous challenges. Despite the Guerrilla Girls' stance against tokenism, some artists of color abandoned Guerrilla Girl membership due to tokenism, silencing, disrespect, and whitewashing. As a woman of color, \"Alma Thomas\" describes having felt uncomfortable wearing the Guerrilla Girls' signature gorilla mask. \"Thomas\" recalls little effort being devoted to understanding the challenges of artists of color. \"Their whiteness was such that they. ... didn't understand that blacks were being put in a completely separate world in the art world, that black male artists and black female artists are completely separated, completely segregated to this day.\" Ultimately, this widespread antagonism led to many \"artists of color [leaving] after a few meetings because they could sense the unspoken hierarchy in the group.\"\n\nEmerging at the tail end of the second-wave feminist movement, the Guerrilla Girls navigated the differences between established and emerging feminist theory during the 1980s. \"Alma Thomas\" describes this grey-area that the Guerrilla Girls occupied as \"universalist feminism,\" bordering on essentialism. Art Historian Anna Chave considers the Guerrilla Girls' essentialism much more profound, leading the group to be \"assailed by ... a rising generation of women wise in the ways of poststructuralist theory, for [their] putative naiveté and susceptibility to essentialism.\" Essentialist views are most clearly exhibited in two Guerrilla Girl books:\"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\" (1998) and the controversial \"Estrogen Bomb\" (2003–13) campaign. Regarding the former, \"Alma Thomas\" worried that \"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\" \"was so embedded in that second-wave feminist and even pre-second-wave essentialism\" that it fulfilled some assumption that all women artists are feminist artists.\n\nStudents at Minneapolis College of Art and Design criticized their \"Estrogen Bomb\" poster campaign, describing it as insensitive towards transgender people since it ties the female gender to estrogen, the same sort of essentialist link the Guerilla Girls aim to critique. Aside from essentialism, the Guerrilla Girls have also been critiqued for failing to integrate intersectionality into their work.\n\nLeading up to a highly publicized 2003 lawsuit, there was increasing animosity toward \"Frida Kahlo\" and \"Käthe Kollwitz.\" Despite founding members' initial intention to create a non-hierarchal, equitable power structure, there was an increasing sense that two people were making \"the final decisions no matter what you said.\" Several Guerrilla Girls felt that their second book, \"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\", primarily represented the views of \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\". Some even felt that \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" completely controlled the book, despite their having selected material created collectively by all Guerrilla Girls. There was even suspicion that these two not only claimed all the credit, but took all of the profits. Some members condemned the book as \"undemocratic and ... against the spirit of the [Guerrilla] Girls.\"\n\nAs the Guerilla Girls gained in popularity, tensions led to what the Girls later called the \"banana split,\" as five members actually split from the collective. Soon after several members stepped aside to form Guerrilla Girls Broadband, \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" moved to trademark the name \"Guerrilla Girls, Inc.\" to distinguish their realm from those of Guerrilla Girls BroadBand and Guerrilla Girls On Tour!, whose focus is discrimination in the theater world. Even though their former colleague \"Gertrude Stein\" was in the on-tour group, \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" charged them with copyright and trademark infringement and unjust enrichment. Many members of the group felt especially betrayed that \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" had launched their lawsuit under their real names, Jerilea Zempel and Erika Rothenberg.\n\nThis prompted negative reactions from both current and former Guerrilla Girls, who objected to \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" claiming responsibility for having created the collective effort, as well as the flippancy with which they exchanged their anonymity for legal standing.\n\nJudge Louis L. Stanton, who handled the case, rejected the \"bizarre\" suggestion that defendants sporting gorilla masks be allowed to testify in his courtroom. He also stated that \"Mundane court procedures for adjudicating legal rights and the ownership of property require direct and cross-examination of real persons with real addresses and attributes.\"\n\nIn their forty-five page complaint, \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" described themselves as the group's \"guiding forces,\" even though the Guerrilla Girls were \"informally organized, [and] had no official hierarchy.\" Initially, they asked the court to stop Guerrilla Girls Broadband from calling themselves Guerrilla Girls and sought millions of dollars in damages. In 2006, they settled with the theatre group who agreed to go by Guerrilla Girls on Tour.\n\nUpon their 1985 debut, the Guerrilla Girls were \"lauded by the very establishment they sought to undermine.\" They have since exhibited at Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, Centre Pompidou, MoMA, which additionally grants them a broader audience for their concerns. Since then, this relationship has only intensified, as the Guerrilla Girls presented their exhibitions in museums and even allowed their works to be collected by hegemonic institutions. Although some have questioned the efficacy, if not hypocrisy, of the group's working within the system that they originally denigrated, few would challenge their decision to let the Getty Institute house their archives.\n\nMembership in the New York City group is by invitation only, based on relationships with current and past members, and one's involvement in the contemporary art world. A mentoring program was formed within the group, pairing a new member with an experienced Guerrilla Girl to bring them into the fold. Due to the lack of formality, the group is comfortable with individuals outside of their base claiming to be Guerrilla Girls; Guerrilla Girl 1 stated in a 2007 interview: \"It can only enhance us by having people of power who have been given credit for being a Girl, even if they were never a Girl.\" Men are not allowed to become Guerrilla Girls, but may support the group by assisting in promotional activities.\n\nGuerrilla Girls names are pseudonyms generally based on dead female artists. Members goes by names such as Kathe Kollwitz, Alma Thomas, Rosalba Carriera, Frida Kahlo, Alice Neel, Julia de Burgos, and Hannah Höch. Guerrilla Girls' \"Carriera\" is credited with the idea of using pseudonyms as a way to not forget female artists. Having read about Rosalba Carriera in a footnote of \"Letters on Cézanne\" by Rainer Maria Rilke, she decided to pay tribute to the little-known female artist with her name. This also helped to solve the problem of media interviews; the group was often interviewed by phone and would not give names, causing problems and confusion amongst the group and the media. Guerrilla Girl 1 joined in the late 1980s, taking on her name as a way to memorialize women in the art community who have fallen under the radar and did not make as notable as an impact as the names takes on by other members.\n\nThe idea to adopt the gorilla as the group's symbol stemmed from a spelling error. One of the first Guerrilla Girls accidentally spelled the group's name at a meeting as \"gorilla.\" Despite the fact that the idea of using a gorilla as group symbol might have been accidental, the choice is nevertheless pertinent to the group's overall message in several key ways.\n\nTo begin with, the gorilla in popular culture and media is often associated with King Kong, or other images of trapped and tamed apes. In the 2010 SAIC Commencement, the comparison between institutionalized artists and tamed apes was explicitly made:\n\nThe gorilla is also typically associated with masculinity. The Met. Museum poster is in part shocking because of its juxtaposition of the eroticized female odalisque body, and the large, snarling gorilla head. The addition of the head detracts from the male gaze and changes the way in which viewers are able to look at or understand the highly sexualized image. Further, the addition of the gorilla questions and modifies stereotypical notions of female beauty within Western art and popular culture, another stated goal of the Guerrilla Girls. \n\nGuerrilla Girls, who wear the masks of big, hairy, powerful jungle creatures whose beauty is hardly conventional ... believe all animals, large and small, are beautiful in their own way.\n\nThough this goal has never been explicitly stated by the group, in the history of Western art, primates have often been associated with the visual arts, and with the figure of the artist. The idea of \"ars simia naturae\" (\"art the ape of nature\") maintains that the job of art is to \"ape\", or faithfully copy and represent nature. This was an idea first popularized by Renaissance thinker Giovanni Boccaccio who alleged that \"the artist in imitating nature only follows Nature's own command.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He began publishing fiction as an adolescent, and put out his first book of stories in 1903; his work centered on the fading provincial milieu dominated by old class structures. Meanwhile, after a break with Maiorescu, he drew toward \"Viața Românească\" and Garabet Ibrăileanu. In 1907, Brătescu-Voinești entered the Romanian parliament, where he would serve for over three decades while his written output declined. In his later years, he became an outspoken anti-Semite and fascist, a stance that, following his country's defeat in World War II, gave way to anti-communism near the end of his life.\n\nBorn in Târgoviște, his parents were Alexandru Brătescu, a low-ranking \"boyar\" and the son of a \"pitar\" (bread supplier), and Alexandrina, daughter of Ion Voinescu, a major in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. He was the second of four children. His childhood took place amidst the traditional environment of old Târgoviște and at the Brătești estate. He attended primary school in his native town from 1875 to 1879, then at the Cocorăscu boarding school and finally at Saint Sava High School in Bucharest from 1879 to 1883. One theory, unsupported by documentary evidence, is that his literary debut occurred with a poem in Târgoviște's \"Armonia\" magazine in 1883; a likelier scenario is that it took place in \"România\" magazine in 1887, when he published the short story \"Dolores\" with the help of Alexandru Vlahuță. He attended the medical faculty of Bucharest University from 1889 to 1890, but switched to law. At the same time, he audited the logic and history of philosophy course taught by Titu Maiorescu, entered Bucharest's \"Junimea\" circle, and in 1890 began contributing to its \"Convorbiri Literare\". His father died in 1890, and Maiorescu took on the role of father figure in the young man's life. After graduating in 1892, he was appointed a judge through his mentor's intervention, serving at Bucharest, Pitești, Craiova and Târgoviște. Living in his native town for nearly two decades after arriving there in 1896, he practiced as a lawyer after leaving the bench. Brătescu-Voinești found life there rather constraining: he had to sell the Brătești property at a loss, and lived on the irregular income earned from lawyer's fees. He lacked a literary discussion circle, largely editing his own work, and would eventually enter politics out of boredom.\n\nHe married Brăila native Penelope Popescu, who was beautiful but poor; the couple had two children. His choice of wife perturbed Maiorescu, who surmised the union would reduce the social standing of Brătescu-Voinești, and in 1896 invited him on a trip to Great Britain (the two had already journeyed to Switzerland and twice to Italy, on Maiorescu's money). While abroad, the younger man engaged in bizarre behavior; upon his return home, the critic asked his brother whether he had not lost his mind. He also steadfastly refused to marry the niece of Maiorescu's wife. The cumulative effect of these transgressions was to prompt the mentor to cut off ties that were never renewed, in spite of the younger man's attempts to restore relations. A postscript took place in 1903, when Brătescu-Voinești submitted the short story \"Neamul Udreștilor\" (later published in \"Voința națională\") for Maiorescu's review. Although some critics have speculated that the changes suggested by the latter caused their break, the writer in fact accepted nearly all of them. In either case, after that date, he split with \"Junimea\" and became affiliated with the \"Viața Românească\" group. Alongside Mihail Sadoveanu, he was one of the magazine's most valued contributors, and entered the public eye thanks to his appearance in its pages. Moreover, its patron Garabet Ibrăileanu somewhat filled in the gap left by the break with Maiorescu.\nHis first book was the 1903 \"Nuvele și schițe\", enlarged and re-edited as \"În lumea dreptății\" (1906), followed by \"Întuneric și lumină\" (1912), after which his fiction gave way to opinion journalism, collected as \"În slujba păcei\" (1919). In 1912, he served as interim director of the National Theatre Bucharest. In 1913, he served as a platoon commander in the Second Balkan War; he was amused by the respect his troops showed due to his white hair, but also became a vehement pacifist thanks to the experience. This caused a break with \"Viața Românească\", which he believed was leading public opinion in the wrong direction. He was credited with co-writing the 1915 play \"Sorana\" alongside A. de Herz, but later claimed the latter had not contributed a single line. He reissued the play in 1920 without Herz' name on the cover, prompting the latter to sue and win the case. From 1918 to 1919, he worked on \"Dacia\" and \"Lamura\", magazines he headed together with Vlahuță and, following the latter's death, alone from 1919 to 1922. His task at \"Dacia\", communicated from government sources, was to discredit those who had collaborated with the country's German occupiers during World War I (of which Herz was emblematic). Brătescu-Voinești and his chief declined to do so, but nevertheless received warnings from potential targets such as Tudor Arghezi.\n\nBrătescu-Voinești evoked the medium of the crumbling ancient \"boyar\" class and its uncomplicated structure, of small-time provincial clerks; his characters are unable to adapt to the modern world, their souls filled with candor, hurt when they come into contact with the brutal bourgeois world, incapable of withstanding the impact of lies and injustice. Although romantic, his material is handled using a classic, direct, simple, often confessional tone. His sympathetic participation in the destinies he narrates gives his prose an intensely lyrical flavor, which helps account for its charm and popularity.\n\nAfter entering political life, he was a member of parliament continuously from 1907 until 1940, and served as secretary of the Assembly of Deputies from 1914 to 1940. He was a member of the National Liberal Party from 1907 to 1914. Elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1908, he advanced to titular member in 1918. Between 1920 and 1940, he published only sporadically: \"Rătăcire\" (1923), \"Firimituri\" (1929), \"Cu undița\" (1933) and \"Din pragul apusului\" (1935). Between 1920 and 1932, he wrote school textbooks in collaboration with other authors.\n\nStarting in 1937, he veered toward fascism, setting forth his theories in programmatic pamphlets: \"Huliganism?\" (1938), \"Strigăte de alarmă în chestia evreiască\" (1940) and \"Germanofobie?\" (1942). His transition was somewhat surprising: other than his pacifist essays of 1919, Brătescu-Voinești had heretofore not made waves within his conservative circles. But beginning with an anti-Semitic press campaign of 1937, he passed through all the stages of Romanian anti-Semitism, from \"popular\" and traditional form to the politically and ideologically radical variant. A declared follower of Mihail Eminescu's nationalism and an unreserved admirer of A. C. Cuza, he proudly called himself a \"hooligan\", praised Hitlerism and stood beside Ion Antonescu during World War II, backing racial laws and deportation of the Jews. Brătescu-Voinești was friends with Antonescu, who in March 1943 granted him an interview in which he thanked Germany for supporting his efforts to rid the country of parasites and internal enemies, and pledged to continue the fight until Jewish Bolshevism was eradicated.\n\nIn his 1942 \"Originea neamului românesc și a limbii noastre\", he built on discredited pre-World War I theories of Nicolae Densușianu to claim that all Romance languages were of Dacian origin, that the Romans were descended from Geto-Dacians, with Latin a literary form of Dacian, and that Italian, French and Spanish had \"Romanian\" roots. Near the end of his life, he engaged in a polemic against the rising Romanian Communist Party: eschewing the invective and incitement of other Romanian fascists, he adopted a feeble biologism, claiming that Marxist doctrine is contradicted by the example of wasps, bees, ants and termites. Concurrently, \"Scînteia\" and other newspapers affiliated with the party hurled copious epithets at the aging figure, denouncing his wartime collaborationism and printed output.\n\n"}

He spent some of his childhood and youth in Viipuri.After divorcing his parents, Jaakko took up his mother's maiden name when he was 16 years old. He translated it from Hallman to Hallama.\n\nHe graduated from Kuopio lyceum in 1936, studied at Cambridge University in 1938 and graduated in Finland as a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1941. In 1960 he received a Special Envoy and a Plenipotentiary Minister.\n\nHallama has been employed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs since 1941. He served as Assistant to the Ministry from 1941 to 1943, Assistant to Bern in 1943-1945 and as a Chamber Secretary in 1945-1948.\n\nHallama served as Secretary of State in Brussels from 1948 to 1949 and in Washington from 1949 to 1952 and then as a Division Officer in 1952-1954 and as Counselor in Moscow 1954-1958.\n\nHe served as Director General for Political Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1959 to 1962, Secretary of State (Secretary of State) from 1962 to 1967, Ambassador to Moscow in 1967-1970 and 1974-1982 and Copenhagen (1970-1974).\n\nAs Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Hallama was forced into resign at the middle of a Note crisis in the fall of 1961, and his role in the settlement was later a huge controversy. Hallama first visited with Foreign Minister Ahti Karjalainen in Moscow and eventually with President Urho Kekkonen in Novosibirsk.Hallama received in Novosibirsk information about the ousting of Chancellor of Justice Olavi Honka from candidate in presidential nomination.\n\nAccording to the history of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by historian Timo Soikkanen, Hallama would immediately have turned to the US Embassy in Helsinki to inform NATO in order to receive moral support to Finland. According to Soikkanen, Hallama secured the matter from the president and the government and thus took a huge risk for his career.\n\nMost other historians, however, have considered Soikkanen's views of Hallama's action as unfounded and imaginative. Among other things, Ilkka Pastinen, who has acted as UN ambassador to Finland, said that, on the contrary, Hallama was extremely cautious. \nAt about 40 years of age, Hallama became ill with Parkinson's disease, which was attempted in 1963 to improve her condition at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm by surgery by the world-famous Swedish brain surgeon Herbert Olivecrona. However, the operation did not succeed, as a result of which Hallama lost his speech almost completely. Despite his illness, Urho Kekkonen relied on his Soviet knowledge so much that he named Hallama as an important ambassador to Moscow in 1967.\n\nAfter four years as an ambassador in Copenhagen, Hallama returned to Moscow as Ambassador in 1974. When Mauno Koivisto became a new president in 1982, Hallama was called home from Moscow and moved from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to retire in 1983 after working for more than 40 years.\n\nJaakko Hallama was married since 1947 with Anita Hallama (\"née\". Weber) and had two sons. Anita Hallama became known for her long-term relationship with President Urho Kekkonen.\n"}

Starting at the young age, he rose to fame for his roles of female impersonator in early Gujarati plays. He retired from acting in 1932 but returned to theatre direction in 1948. He directed and acted in several successful plays. He was awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1971.\n\nHe was born in the family of Bhojak, the performing caste of Brahmins, in Undhai near Visnagar on 30 January 1889. However, his family members were traditionally involved in performing arts and singing. He studied up to second standard. He was trained in performing arts and singing by his grandfather, Tribhuvandas who himself was trained by Ustad Fakhruddin. He was also trained in music by Pandit Vadilal Nayak.\n\nHe started his career by joining Dadabhai Thunthi's Urdu performing art company in Calcutta in 1897. He worked in a chorus of girls for a salary of six rupees a month. He returned to Bombay and joined Chotalal Kapadia's Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali in 1901. Along with Gujarati, he also performed in Hindi and Urdu languages. He mainly performed as a female impersonator as females were not allowed in theatres in those times. He played role of Desdemona as a female impersonator in \"Saubhagya Sundari\", an adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Othello\" by Parsi theatre in Bombay. It was successful and Jaishankar received his sobriquet \"Sundari\" (). He performed female lead opposite Bapulal Nayak several times including in \"Jugal Jugari\" (Jugal the Gambler), \"Kamlata\" (Lovestruck Girl, 1904), \"Madhu Bansari\" (Sweet Flute) and \"Sneh Sarita\" (River of Affection), \"Vikrama Charitra\" (Vikrama's Life, 1902). He along with Bapulal brought Govardhanram Tripathi's \"Saraswatichandra\", Nrisinh Vibhakar's nationalistic plays and plays of Mulshankar Mulani to stage. He retired in 1932 and returned to Visnagar. In \"Vikrama Charitra\", he played a character of Rambha, a Dairy-maid. This play continued for 3 years and was performed 160 times, every Saturday nights.\n\nHe was active in Ahmedabad from 1948 to 1962 as the director in theatre. He joined Gujarat Vidhya Sabha in 1948 in Ahmedabad to perform in Ramanbhai Neelkanth's \"Raino Parvat\" in 1950 on the occasion of its centenary. Later he organised a performing troupe and theatre school, \"Natamandal\" with Rasiklal Parikh and Ganesh Mavlankar. He revived Bhavai, the traditional performing art form, by directing \"Mithyabhiman\" (False Vanity, 1955), a satirical play by Dalpatram. They produced several plays like \"Mena Gurjari\" (Mena of Gujarat) in 1953 which he synthesized Bhavai and Beijing Opera. He trained several actors including Jaswant Thaker, Dina Pathak, Pransukh Nayak and Kailash Pandya.\n\nHe died on 22 January 1975 at Visnagar, Gujarat.\n\nHe received the Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1951; which is considered the highest literary award in Gujarati literature. In 1957, Rajendra Prasad presented him with the highest Indian recognition given to practicing artists - the President's award, now called the Sangeet Natak Akademi award for drama direction. In 1963, he was elected chairman for the Department of Arts at Gujarati Sahitya Parishad. He was felicitated by Gujarat Rajya Sangeet Nrutya Akademi in 1967. He was awarded Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award, by the Government of India in 1971.\n\nHis autobiography \"Thoda Aansu, Thoda Ful\" was in part written and in part dictated to his son Dinkar Bhojak and Somabhai Patel over a period of four years. It was first published in 1976. It was adopted as part of the syllabus at the Master of Arts course level at the Gujarat University. \"Thoda Aansu, Thoda Ful\" was reprinted in 1989 in an expanded version. In 2002, the older edition was translated into Hindi as \"Kuchh Aansu, Kuchh Phool\" by Dinesh Khanna and published by the National School of Drama. In 2011, it was translated into English as \"Some Blossoms, Some Tears\".\n\nIn his memory, Jaishankar Sundari Natyagrah - a drama theatre was named after him in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The Bhavai Government Museum in Vadnagar, North Gujarat contains his exhibition and a description of his work. His oil painted portrait was unveiled by the Kala Mandal of Morbi and adorns the halls of the Kala Mandir in Saurashtra.\n\nThe play \"Sundari : An Actor Prepares\" based on his autobiography was produced in 1998.\n\n"}
{"id": "186932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186932", "title": "Japanese people", "text": "Japanese people\n\nThe Japanese language is a Japonic language that is related to the Ryukyuan languages and was treated as a language isolate in the past. The earliest attested form of the language, Old Japanese, dates to the 8th century. Japanese phonology is characterized by a relatively small number of vowel phonemes, frequent gemination, and a distinctive pitch accent system. The modern Japanese language has a tripartite writing system using hiragana, katakana, and kanji. The language includes native Japanese words and a large number of words derived from the Chinese language. In Japan the adult literacy rate in the Japanese language exceeds 99%. Dozens of Japanese dialects are spoken in regions of Japan.\n\nJapanese religion has traditionally been syncretic in nature, combining elements of Buddhism and Shinto (Shinbutsu-shūgō). Shinto, a polytheistic religion with no book of religious canon, is Japan's native religion. Shinto was one of the traditional grounds for the right to the throne of the Japanese imperial family, and was codified as the state religion in 1868 (State Shinto), but was abolished by the American occupation in 1945. Mahayana Buddhism came to Japan in the sixth century and evolved into many different sects. Today, the largest form of Buddhism among Japanese people is the Jōdo Shinshū sect founded by Shinran.\n\nA large majority of Japanese people profess to believe in both Shinto and Buddhism. Japanese people's religion functions mostly as a foundation for mythology, traditions, and neighborhood activities, rather than as the single source of moral guidelines for one's life.\n\nAbout one million, or slightly under 1%, of Japan's population are Christians. A larger proportion of members of the Japanese diaspora practice Christianity; about 60% of Japanese Brazilians and 90% of Japanese Mexicans are Roman Catholics, while about 37% of Japanese Americans are Christians (33% Protestant and 4% Catholic).\n\nCertain genres of writing originated in and are often associated with Japanese society. These include the haiku, tanka, and I Novel, although modern writers generally avoid these writing styles. Historically, many works have sought to capture or codify traditional Japanese cultural values and aesthetics. Some of the most famous of these include Murasaki Shikibu's \"The Tale of Genji\" (1021), about Heian court culture; Miyamoto Musashi's \"The Book of Five Rings\" (1645), concerning military strategy; Matsuo Bashō's \"Oku no Hosomichi\" (1691), a travelogue; and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki's essay \"In Praise of Shadows\" (1933), which contrasts Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nFollowing the opening of Japan to the West in 1854, some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan; they include \"\" by Nitobe Inazō (1900), concerning \"samurai\" ethics, and \"The Book of Tea\" by Okakura Kakuzō (1906), which deals with the philosophical implications of the Japanese tea ceremony. Western observers have often attempted to evaluate Japanese society as well, to varying degrees of success; one of the most well-known and controversial works resulting from this is Ruth Benedict's \"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\" (1946).\n\nTwentieth-century Japanese writers recorded changes in Japanese society through their works. Some of the most notable authors included Natsume Sōseki, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Osamu Dazai, Fumiko Enchi, Akiko Yosano, Yukio Mishima, and Ryōtarō Shiba. Popular contemporary authors such as Ryū Murakami, Haruki Murakami, and Banana Yoshimoto have been translated into many languages and enjoy international followings, and Yasunari Kawabata and Kenzaburō Ōe were awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nDecorative arts in Japan date back to prehistoric times. Jōmon pottery includes examples with elaborate ornamentation. In the Yayoi period, artisans produced mirrors, spears, and ceremonial bells known as \"dōtaku.\" Later burial mounds, or \"kofun,\" preserve characteristic clay \"haniwa,\" as well as wall paintings.\n\nBeginning in the Nara period, painting, calligraphy, and sculpture flourished under strong Confucian and Buddhist influences from China. Among the architectural achievements of this period are the Hōryū-ji and the Yakushi-ji, two Buddhist temples in Nara Prefecture. After the cessation of official relations with the Tang dynasty in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China. Extravagant art and clothing was commissioned by nobles to decorate their court, and although the aristocracy was quite limited in size and power, many of these pieces are still extant. After the Tōdai-ji was attacked and burned during the Genpei War, a special office of restoration was founded, and the Tōdai-ji became an important artistic center. The leading masters of the time were Unkei and Kaikei.\n\nPainting advanced in the Muromachi period in the form of ink wash painting under the influence of Zen Buddhism as practiced by such masters as Sesshū Tōyō. Zen Buddhist tenets were also elaborated into the tea ceremony during the Sengoku period. During the Edo period, the polychrome painting screens of the Kanō school were made influential thanks to their powerful patrons (including the Tokugawas). Popular artists created \"ukiyo-e\", woodblock prints for sale to commoners in the flourishing cities. Pottery such as Imari ware was highly valued as far away as Europe.\n\nIn theater, Noh is a traditional, spare dramatic form that developed in tandem with kyōgen farce. In stark contrast to the restrained refinement of noh, kabuki, an \"explosion of color\", uses every possible stage trick for dramatic effect. Plays include sensational events such as suicides, and many such works were performed in both kabuki and bunraku puppet theaters.\n\nSince the Meiji Restoration, Japan has absorbed elements of Western culture and has given them a \"Japanese\" feel or modification into it. Its modern decorative, practical and performing arts works span a spectrum ranging from the traditions of Japan to purely Western modes. Products of popular culture, including J-pop, J-rock, manga and anime have found audiences and fans around the world.\n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that Stone Age people lived in the Japanese archipelago during the Paleolithic period between 39,000 and 21,000 years ago. Japan was then connected to mainland Asia by at least one land bridge, and nomadic hunter-gatherers crossed to Japan. Flint tools and bony implements of this era have been excavated in Japan.\n\nIn the 18th century, Arai Hakuseki suggested that the ancient stone tools in Japan were left behind by the Shukushin. Later, Philipp Franz von Siebold argued that the Ainu people were indigenous to northern Japan. Iha Fuyū suggested that Japanese and Ryukyuan people have the same ethnic origin, based on his 1906 research on the Ryukyuan languages. In the Taishō period, Torii Ryūzō claimed that Yamato people used Yayoi pottery and Ainu used Jōmon pottery.\n\nAfter World War II, Kotondo Hasebe and Hisashi Suzuki claimed that the origin of Japanese people was not newcomers in the Yayoi period (300 BCE – 300 CE) but the people in the Jōmon period. However, Kazuro Hanihara announced a new racial admixture theory in 1984 and a \"dual structure model\" in 1991. According to Hanihara, modern Japanese lineages began with Jōmon people, who moved into the Japanese archipelago during Paleolithic times from their homeland in southeast Asia, followed by a second wave of immigration, from northeast Asia to Japan during the Yayoi period. Following a population expansion in Neolithic times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, admixture was common in the island regions of Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Honshū, but did not prevail in the outlying islands of Okinawa and Hokkaidō, and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people continued to dominate there. Mark J. Hudson claims that the main ethnic image of Japanese people was biologically and linguistically formed from 400 BCE to 1,200 CE. Currently, the most well-regarded theory is that present-day Japanese are descendants of both the indigenous Jōmon people and the immigrant Yayoi people.\n\nSome of the world's oldest known pottery pieces were developed by the Jōmon people in the Upper Paleolithic period, dating back as far as 16,000 years. The name \"Jōmon\" (縄文 \"Jōmon\") means \"cord-impressed pattern\", and comes from the characteristic markings found on the pottery. The Jōmon people were Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, though at least one middle to late Jōmon site (, ca. 1200–1000 BC) had a primitive rice-growing agriculture. They relied primarily on fish for protein. \n\nSome, including anthropologist Joseph Powell, believe that the Jōmon migrated from South Asia or Southeast Asia and became the Ainu of today. A research, analysing the autosomal DNA of several Jomon bones, suggest an origin of the Jomon people in Siberia or northeastern Central Asia near lake Baikal.\n\nResearchers suggests that the Ainu retain a certain degree of uniqueness in their genetic make-up, while having some affinities with other regional populations in Japan as well as with the Nivkhs of the Russian Far East.\n\nMark J. Hudson posits that Japan was settled by a Paleo-Mongoloid population in the Pleistocene who became the Jōmon, and that their features can be seen in the Ainu and Ryukyuan people. The Jōmon shared some physical characteristics, such as relatively abundant body hair and light skin, with Caucasians, but anthropological genetics shows them to derive from a separate genetic lineage from that of Europeans.\n\nBeginning around 300 BC, the Yayoi people entered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the Jōmon. The Yayoi brought wet-rice farming and advanced bronze and iron technology to Japan. The more productive paddy field systems allowed the communities to support larger populations and spread over time, in turn becoming the basis for more advanced institutions and heralding the new civilization of the succeeding Kofun period.\n\nThe estimated population of Japan in the late Jōmon period was about one hundred thousand, compared to about three million by the Nara period. Taking the growth rates of hunting and agricultural societies into account, it is calculated that about one and half million immigrants moved to Japan in the period.\n\nDuring the Japanese colonial period of 1895 to 1945, the phrase \"Japanese people\" was used to refer not only to residents of the Japanese archipelago, but also to people from colonies who held Japanese citizenship, such as Taiwanese people and Korean people. The official term used to refer to ethnic Japanese during this period was . Such linguistic distinctions facilitated forced assimilation of colonized ethnic identities into a single Imperial Japanese identity.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, many Nivkh people and Orok people from southern Sakhalin, who held Japanese citizenship in Karafuto Prefecture, were forced to repatriate to Hokkaidō by the Soviet Union as a part of Japanese people. On the other hand, many Sakhalin Koreans who had held Japanese citizenship until the end of the war were left stateless by the Soviet occupation.\n\nArticle 10 of the Constitution of Japan defines the term \"Japanese\" based upon Japanese nationality. The concept of \"ethnic groups\" in Japanese census statistics differs from the concept applied in many other countries. For example, the United Kingdom Census queries the respondent's \"ethnic or racial background\", regardless of nationality. The Japanese Statistics Bureau, however, asks only about nationality in the census. Because the census equates nationality with ethnicity, its figures erroneously assume that naturalized Japanese citizens and Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic backgrounds are ethnically Japanese. John Lie, Eiji Oguma, and other scholars problematize the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous, arguing that it is more accurate to describe Japan as a multiethnic society, although such claims have long been rejected by conservative elements of Japanese society such as former Japanese Prime Minister Tarō Asō, who once described Japan as being a nation of \"one race, one civilization, one language and one culture\".\n\nThe term is used to refer to Japanese people who emigrated from Japan and their descendants.\n\nEmigration from Japan was recorded as early as the 12th century to the Philippines and Borneo, and in the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of traders from Japan also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population. However, migration of Japanese people did not become a mass phenomenon until the Meiji era, when Japanese people began to go to Brazil, the United States, the Philippines, China, Canada, and Peru. There was also significant emigration to the territories of the Empire of Japan during the colonial period, but most of these emigrants and settlers repatriated to Japan after the end of World War II in Asia.\n\nAccording to the Association of Nikkei and Japanese Abroad, there are about 2.5 million \"nikkeijin\" living in their adopted countries. The largest of these foreign communities are in the Brazilian states of São Paulo and Paraná. There are also significant cohesive Japanese communities in the Philippines, East Malaysia, Peru, Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Misiones in Argentina, the U.S. states of Hawaii, California, and Washington, and the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Toronto. Separately, the number of Japanese citizens living abroad is over one million according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44112", "title": "John Dalton", "text": "John Dalton\n\nJohn Dalton FRS (; 6 September 1766 – 27 July 1844) was an English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist. He is best known for introducing the atomic theory into chemistry, and for his research into colour blindness, sometimes referred to as Daltonism in his honour.\n\nJohn Dalton was born into a Quaker family in Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth, in Cumberland, England. His father was a weaver. He received his early education from his father and from Quaker John Fletcher, who ran a private school in the nearby village of Pardshaw Hall. Dalton's family was too poor to support him for long and he began to earn his living at the age of ten in the service of a wealthy local Quaker, Elihu Robinson. It is said he began teaching at a local school at age 12 and became proficient in Latin at age 14.\n\nWhen he was 15, Dalton joined his older brother Jonathan in running a Quaker school in Kendal, Westmorland, about from his home. Around the age of 23 Dalton may have considered studying law or medicine, but his relatives did not encourage him, perhaps because being a Dissenter, he was barred from attending English universities. He acquired much scientific knowledge from informal instruction by John Gough, a blind philosopher who was gifted in the sciences and arts. At the age of 27 he was appointed teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy at the \"New College\" in Manchester, a dissenting academy (the lineal predecessor, following a number of changes of location, of Harris Manchester College, Oxford). He remained there until the age of 34, when the college's worsening financial situation led him to resign his post and begin a new career as a private tutor in mathematics and natural philosophy.\n\nDalton's early life was influenced by a prominent Eaglesfield Quaker, Elihu Robinson, a competent meteorologist and instrument maker, who interested him in problems of mathematics and meteorology. During his years in Kendal, Dalton contributed solutions to problems and answered questions on various subjects in \"The Ladies' Diary\" and the \"Gentleman's Diary\". In 1787 at age 21 he began his meteorological diary in which, during the succeeding 57 years, he entered more than 200,000 observations. He rediscovered George Hadley's theory of atmospheric circulation (now known as the Hadley cell) around this time. In 1793 Dalton's first publication, \"Meteorological Observations and Essays\", contained the seeds of several of his later discoveries but despite the originality of his treatment, little attention was paid to them by other scholars. A second work by Dalton, \"Elements of English Grammar\", was published in 1801.\n\nAfter leaving the Lake District, Dalton returned annually to spend his holidays studying meteorology, something which involved a lot of hill-walking. Until the advent of aeroplanes and weather balloons, the only way to make measurements of temperature and humidity at altitude was to climb a mountain. Dalton estimated the height using a barometer. The Ordnance Survey did not publish maps for the Lake District until the 1860s. Before then, Dalton was one of the few authorities on the heights of the region's mountains. He was often accompanied by Jonathan Otley, who also made a study of the heights of the local peaks, using Dalton's figures as a comparison to check his work. Otley published his information in his map of 1818. Otley became both an assistant and a friend to Dalton.\n\nIn 1794, shortly after his arrival in Manchester, Dalton was elected a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, the \"Lit & Phil\", and a few weeks later he communicated his first paper on \"Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours\", in which he postulated that shortage in colour perception was caused by discoloration of the liquid medium of the eyeball. As both he and his brother were colour blind, he recognised that the condition must be hereditary.\n\nAlthough Dalton's theory lost credence in his lifetime, the thorough and methodical nature of his research into his visual problem was so broadly recognised that Daltonism became a common term for colour blindness. Examination of his preserved eyeball in 1995 demonstrated that Dalton had a less common kind of colour blindness, deuteroanopia, in which medium wavelength sensitive cones are missing (rather than functioning with a mutated form of pigment, as in the most common type of colour blindness, deuteroanomaly). Besides the blue and purple of the optical spectrum he was only able to recognise one colour, yellow, or, as he said in a paper,\n\nIn 1800, Dalton became secretary of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and in the following year he presented an important series of lectures, entitled \"Experimental Essays\" on the constitution of mixed gases; the pressure of steam and other vapours at different temperatures in a vacuum and in air; on evaporation; and on the thermal expansion of gases. The four essays, presented between 2 and 30 October 1801, were published in the \"Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester\" in 1802.\n\nThe second essay opens with the remark,\n\nAfter describing experiments to ascertain the pressure of steam at various points between 0 and 100 °C (32 and 212 °F), Dalton concluded from observations of the vapour pressure of six different liquids, that the variation of vapour pressure for all liquids is equivalent, for the same variation of temperature, reckoning from vapour of any given pressure.\n\nIn the fourth essay he remarks,\n\nHe enunciated Gay-Lussac's law, published in 1802 by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (Gay-Lussac credited the discovery to unpublished work from the 1780s by Jacques Charles). In the two or three years following the lectures, Dalton published several papers on similar topics. \"On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids\" (read on 21 October 1803, published until 1805) contained his law of partial pressures now known as Dalton's law.\n\nThe most important of all Dalton's investigations are concerned with the atomic theory in chemistry. While his name is inseparably associated with this theory, the origin of Dalton's atomic theory is not fully understood. The theory may have been suggested to him either by researches on ethylene (\"olefiant gas\") and methane (\"carburetted hydrogen\") or by analysis of nitrous oxide (\"protoxide of azote\") and nitrogen dioxide (\"deutoxide of azote\"), both views resting on the authority of Thomas Thomson.\n\nFrom 1814 to 1819, Irish chemist William Higgins claimed that Dalton had plagiarised his ideas, but Higgins' theory did not address relative atomic mass. However, recent evidence suggests that Dalton's development of thought may have been influenced by the ideas of another Irish chemist Bryan Higgins, who was William's uncle. Bryan believed that an atom was a heavy central particle surrounded by an atmosphere of caloric, the supposed substance of heat at the time. The size of the atom was determined by the diameter of the caloric atmosphere. Based on the evidence, Dalton was aware of Bryan's theory and adopted very similar ideas and language, but he never acknowledged Bryan's anticipation of his caloric model. However, the essential novelty of Dalton's atomic theory is that he provided a method of calculating relative atomic weights for the chemical elements, something that neither Bryan nor William Higgins did; his priority for that crucial step is uncontested.\n\nA study of Dalton's laboratory notebooks, discovered in the rooms of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, concluded that so far from Dalton being led by his search for an explanation of the law of multiple proportions to the idea that chemical combination consists in the interaction of atoms of definite and characteristic weight, the idea of atoms arose in his mind as a purely physical concept, forced on him by study of the physical properties of the atmosphere and other gases. The first published indications of this idea are to be found at the end of his paper \"On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids\" already mentioned. There he says:\n\nThe main points of Dalton's atomic theory are:\n\nDalton proposed an additional controversial \"rule of greatest simplicity\" that could not be independently confirmed.\n\nFor elements that combined in multiple ratios, their combinations were assumed to be the simplest ones possible. Two combinations resulted in a binary and a ternary compound. This was merely an assumption, derived from faith in the simplicity of nature. No evidence was then available to scientists to deduce how many atoms of each element combine to form compound molecules. But this or some other such rule was absolutely necessary to any incipient theory, since one needed an assumed molecular formula in order to calculate relative atomic weights. Dalton's \"rule of greatest simplicity\" caused him to assume that the formula for water was OH and ammonia was NH, quite different from our modern understanding (HO, NH). Despite the uncertainty at the heart of Dalton's atomic theory, the principles of the theory survived.\n\nDalton published his table of relative atomic weights containing six elements, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur and phosphorus, with the atom of hydrogen conventionally assumed to weigh 1. Dalton provided no indication in this paper how he had arrived at these numbers but in his laboratory notebook, dated 6 September 1803, is a list in which he set out the relative weights of the atoms of a number of elements, derived from analysis of water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, etc. by chemists of the time.\n\nThe extension of this idea to substances in general necessarily led him to the law of multiple proportions, and the comparison with experiment brilliantly confirmed his deduction. In the paper \"On the Proportion of the Several Gases in the Atmosphere\", read by him in November 1802, the law of multiple proportions appears to be anticipated in the words:\n\nBut there is reason to suspect that this sentence may have been added some time after the reading of the paper, which was not published until 1805.\n\nCompounds were listed as binary, ternary, quaternary, etc. (molecules composed of two, three, four, etc. atoms) in the \"New System of Chemical Philosophy\" depending on the number of atoms a compound had in its simplest, empirical form.\n\nDalton hypothesised the structure of compounds can be represented in whole number ratios. So, one atom of element X combining with one atom of element Y is a binary compound. Furthermore, one atom of element X combining with two atoms of element Y or vice versa, is a ternary compound. Many of the first compounds listed in the \"New System of Chemical Philosophy\" correspond to modern views, although many others do not.\n\nDalton used his own symbols to visually represent the atomic structure of compounds. They were depicted in the \"New System of Chemical Philosophy\", where he listed 20 elements and 17 simple molecules.\n\nDalton published papers on such diverse topics as rain and dew and the origin of springs (hydrosphere); on heat, the colour of the sky, steam and the reflection and refraction of light; and on the grammatical subjects of the auxiliary verbs and participles of the English language.\n\nAs an investigator, Dalton was often content with rough and inaccurate instruments, even though better ones were obtainable. Sir Humphry Davy described him as \"a very coarse experimenter\", who almost always found the results he required, trusting to his head rather than his hands. On the other hand, historians who have replicated some of his crucial experiments have confirmed Dalton's skill and precision.\n\nIn the preface to the second part of Volume I of his \"New System\", he says he had so often been misled by taking for granted the results of others that he determined to write \"as little as possible but what I can attest by my own experience\", but this independence he carried so far that it sometimes resembled lack of receptivity. Thus he distrusted, and probably never fully accepted, Gay-Lussac's conclusions as to the combining volumes of gases.\n\nHe held unconventional views on chlorine. Even after its elementary character had been settled by Davy, he persisted in using the atomic weights he himself had adopted, even when they had been superseded by the more accurate determinations of other chemists.\n\nHe always objected to the chemical notation devised by Jöns Jakob Berzelius, although most thought that it was much simpler and more convenient than his own cumbersome system of circular symbols.\n\nFor \"Rees's Cyclopædia\" Dalton contributed articles on Chemistry and Meteorology, but the topics are not known.\n\nHe contributed 117 \"Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester\" from 1817 until his death in 1844 while president of that organisation. Of these the earlier are the most important. In one of them, read in 1814, he explains the principles of volumetric analysis, in which he was one of the earliest researchers. In 1840 a paper on phosphates and arsenates, often regarded as a weaker work, was refused by the Royal Society, and he was so incensed that he published it himself. He took the same course soon afterwards with four other papers, two of which (\"On the quantity of acids, bases and salts in different varieties of salts\" and \"On a new and easy method of analysing sugar\") contain his discovery, regarded by him as second in importance only to atomic theory, that certain anhydrates, when dissolved in water, cause no increase in its volume, his inference being that the salt enters into the pores of the water.\n\nEven before he had propounded the atomic theory, Dalton had attained a considerable scientific reputation. In 1803, he was chosen to give a series of lectures on natural philosophy at the Royal Institution in London, and he delivered another series of lectures there in 1809–1810. Some witnesses reported that he was deficient in the qualities that make an attractive lecturer, being harsh and indistinct in voice, ineffective in the treatment of his subject, and singularly wanting in the language and power of illustration.\n\nIn 1810, Sir Humphry Davy asked him to offer himself as a candidate for the fellowship of the Royal Society, but Dalton declined, possibly for financial reasons. In 1822 he was proposed without his knowledge, and on election paid the usual fee. Six years previously he had been made a corresponding member of the French Académie des Sciences, and in 1830 he was elected as one of its eight foreign associates in place of Davy. In 1833, Earl Grey's government conferred on him a pension of £150, raised in 1836 to £300. Dalton was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834.\n\nA young James Prescott Joule, who later studied and published (1843) on the nature of heat and its relationship to mechanical work, was a pupil of Dalton in his last years.\n\nDalton never married and had only a few close friends. As a Quaker, he lived a modest and unassuming personal life.\n\nFor the 26 years prior to his death, Dalton lived in a room in the home of the Rev W. Johns, a published botanist, and his wife, in George Street, Manchester. Dalton and Johns died in the same year (1844).\n\nDalton's daily round of laboratory work and tutoring in Manchester was broken only by annual excursions to the Lake District and occasional visits to London. In 1822 he paid a short visit to Paris, where he met many distinguished resident men of science. He attended several of the earlier meetings of the British Association at York, Oxford, Dublin and Bristol.\n\nDalton suffered a minor stroke in 1837, and a second in 1838 left him with a speech impairment, although he remained able to perform experiments. In May 1844 he had another stroke; on 26 July 1844 he recorded with trembling hand his last meteorological observation. On 27 July 1844, in Manchester, Dalton fell from his bed and was found lifeless by his attendant.\n\nDalton was accorded a civic funeral with full honours. His body lay in state in Manchester Town Hall for four days and more than 40,000 people filed past his coffin. The funeral procession included representatives of the city's major civic, commercial, and scientific bodies. He was buried in Manchester in Ardwick cemetery. The cemetery is now a playing field, but pictures of the original grave may be found in published materials.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the traditional custom of \"hānai\", she was initially reared by her mother's parents. Her grandmother Naliipoʻaimoku, a traditional dancer in the court of Queen Emma, taught her chants and stories, while her grandfather Keli'ikanaka'ole-o-Haililani (k) was a healer and \"kahuna pale keiki\" (obstetrician) who used \"lomilomi massage\", \"laʻau lapaʻau\" (herbal medicine), \"hoʻoponopono\" (forgiveness), and \"pule\" (prayer).

His first teacher was Tito Aparicio. He never planned on a career as a musician, it merely happened. \n\nAt the age of eight, he appeared as a soloist on radio stations LT2 and LT8 of the city of Rosario. Then, he began to work as a freelance bandeoneonist. He perfected his technique with Jose Bustamante and, like Anibal Troilo and Astor Piazzolla before him, he benefited from the influence of mythical Rosario Bandoneon player Antonio Rios. He also studied harmony, counterpoint and composition with Titi Rossi. Today he is a player with and exceptional technique, combined with his natural gift for discovering and illuminating the natural spaces in music. At 27 years old, moved to Buenos Aires, where he became one of the most sought-after bandoneon players on the tango scene, and played with many different groups, including the Jose Basso, Osvaldo Berlinghieri, Alberto Di Paulo, Carlos Lazari, Osvaldo Piro, Osvaldo Requena, Francisco Rotundo and Hector Varela tango orchestras. He also established his own groups, with which he performed extensively in the better known tango venues of Buenos Aires such as Michelangelo, Caño 14 and La Ciudad, and toured all over the world. \n\nHe created Ensamble Trio (bandoneon, piano and bass), played duos with guitarist Jorge Labanca and, together with bandoneonist Lisandro Adrover, set up the revolutionary nonet Ensamble Porteño (flute, clarinet, two violins, two bandoneons, piano, bass and percussion). These groups mainly used Varvello's own arrangements and played and recorded many of his works. The albums \"Despertar en Buenos Aires\" (Ensamble Porteño, 1978), \"Momentos Inestables\" (Ensamble Trio, 1984) and \"Devenir\" (Duoo Varvello- Labanca, 1989) bear witness to his work of those years. He is currently a member of the orchestra accompanying the highly acclaimed show Forever Tango which has been staged the world over, including Europe, Japan and de U.S. In 2002, the famous company TESTIGO published \"A magic instrument\", where this exceptional artist, brings awareness of the uniqueness of this incredible instrument in classical music, a unique feat of this kind, he played Bach, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, and also tango music. In 2003 the company Zaf records from Argentina, published \"Tangos de Vanguardia\" Trio Ensemble, under his direction and arrangements. Also acts as musical director of the show \"Tango Dreams\", in appearances with the symphony orchestras of Albuquerque, New Mexico and Long Beach, California, USA, as well in the city of Tokyo, Japan.\n\nHis orchestra participated in the activities of the Montreal International Tango Festival of 2006 & 2007. He also made recordings of bandoneon \"solos\" for Universal Studios, U.S. music division, with participation in the project \"Cafe de los Maestros,\" making presentations 2008 in Paris and Lyon, Buenos Aires, Oman, Brussels and many more.

His Works are published by Editorial Lagos S.R.L./ Warner Chappell in Argentina, and by Tonos Musikverlag GmbH in Germany. Mr. Varvello also teaches extensively. He lives in Buenos Aires with his wife and children, and receives students from everywhere in the world \"Teaching the bandoneon is a way of being in contact with the music I love. And it is very stimulating to see how students gradually discover that their relationship with the bandoneon is something personal and specific to each of them\".\nIn 2012, Mr. Varvello just released a new cd, again in classical music with the famous company TESTIGO, \"Concerto for bandoneon\", this album includes a concert for bandoneon with strings, piano, harp, timpani and percussion, in three movements, and is accompanied by works of Frédéric Chopin, Johann Sebastian Bach and Achille-Claude Debussy, and tangos of Agustín Bardi, Eduardo Rovira Astor Piazzolla. \n\nAlso Mr. Varvello has participated in a tribute to Eduardo Rovira conducted by National University of Lanus in Argentine, and interpret among other works \"Bandomania\"\n"}

She spent her childhood in a way typical for such a harsh environment. Her parents split up when she was six years old. In a large family, also including Olga's older sister Jaroslava's family (a single mother of five children), any free hand was useful. Therefore, it was obvious that Olga cared for her young nieces and nephews since her childhood. As a child, she also attended Milíčův dům (Milíč House in Prague) established by Přemysl Pitter. Olga used to spend a lot of time in libraries where she acquired her strong lifelong love of literature. Although her family's life was modest, Olga's mother used to take her children to cinema and theatre quite often. After graduating from secondary school, Olga became a trainee in the Tomáš Baťa factory, where she also worked afterwards. In the course of working on a sewing machine, she lost four fingers on her left hand.\n\nWhen she was about twenty, she was an enthusiastic theatre lover and attended the drama classes of Professor Lydie Wegener. Together with her other pupils, she acted in an amateur theatre performance in Divadlo Na slupi (which does not exist anymore). During the 1950s, she went through a number of different jobs. She worked, e.g., as an accountant, a store keeper, a sales assistant.\n\nOlga met Václav Havel at the Prague writer's hangout Café Slavia in the early 1950s and married him in 1964. During the 1960s, her husband became a respected author both at home and in Europe. In the second half of the 1960s, he - as a writer and a contributor to the cultural magazines - was involved in a democratization process, particularly in the field of culture. He advocated freedom of speech, independence of culture, return of full-fledged civil rights. During the years 1961 – 1967, Olga Havel worked at the theatre Divadlo Na zábradlí (Theatre on the Balustrade) where Václav was also active until 1968. Václav Havel made no secret of the fact that, despite the diversity of personalities and family environment as well as all the usual problems of life and crises, Olga meant a lot for him. He appreciated how quickly this seemingly ordinary young woman from Žižkov became a part of the Prague intellectual environment of the 1950s and '60s, that she was an attentive first reader and critic of his essays and dramatic works, a valuable supporter and collaborator in the difficult years of Charta 77 as well as a reliable lifelong partner.\n\nIn 1967, the Havels bought a country estate in the foothills called Hrádeček. Later on, when Václav Havel was gradually losing not only a possibility to find a job but also some contacts and friends in Prague, the couple moved to their cottage and practically lived there until November 1989. Olga Havel, a passionate mushroom-picker and nature-lover, fell in love with the place just like her husband. She was fond of gardening and taking her dogs for long walks to the forest. They alternated moments of peace and seclusion used by Václav for his work with a rich social life, of which they were hospitable organizers.\n\nFollowing the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact armies until the revolution in 1989, Václav Havel could not publish, theatres were not allowed to stage his plays and he was gradually pushed out of the public cultural activities and became one of the most prominent dissidents. As a fighter against continuously intensified totalitarian regime, he was persecuted by the secret police (Státní bezpečnost), he was often detained, interrogated and imprisoned eventually. Olga Havel was always an important back up to her husband; she supported him in all his dissident activities and she was also involved in them. She was described as \"...full of forthright, even earthy common sense. A shrewd, intuitive judge of people, calm but tough, and with a natural dignity...\" After he was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment, Olga Havel together with her brother-in-law Ivan Havel took over responsibilities and obligations in samizdat Edition Expedition, which was led by Václav before. In relation to the prosecution for transporting prohibited printed material, she was accused of subversion of a republic in the case of \"Karavan\". Her prosecution was abolished after the fall of the totalitarian regime.\n\nOlga Havel was the addressee of the intellectually deep, philosophically and existentially toned letters sent by Václav Havel during the years 1979 – 1983 from prison. Some of them were intended not only to her but also to the philosophically minded circle of friends with whom he - through the letters - tried to think through different things and they tried to help him stay intellectually active. Letters to Olga, (\"Dopisy Olze\") a selection of these letters, forms one of the most important books of Václav Havel, first published in 1983 in the Edition Expedition. Olga also organized meetings, distributed manuscripts and participated in the Charta 77 activities. She signed Charta 77 in 1982.\n\nIn the difficult years of insecurity, persecution and imprisonment of her husband, Olga fully and with joy used the opportunity to escape from the difficulties of everyday life by joining Hrobka (Tomb), the circle of friends organizing various humorous activities. Václav Havel characterized this circle accurately: \"In the early 1980s, I was – like several of my friends - imprisoned, conditions outside were harsh and so Hrobka was created as a way of self-defence; it was a cheerful community of imprisoned dissidents' wives, those who remained at large and their friends.\" Olga soon became one of the organizers of a diverse range of cultural and social activities and thus she returned to her creative interests from the years of amateur theatre. She added to the community life not only as a regular hostess of costumed garden parties at Hrádeček on the occasion of her birthday but, first of all, she herself came up with many ideas and inspiration.\n\nIn 1987, Olga co-founded Originální Videojournal, the samizdat video news magazine which documented the activities of dissent in pictures and informed about the present political and cultural situation in Czechoslovakia openly. She actively worked in the magazine and focused mainly on ecological topics. In late 1985, she initiated a magazine O divadle (About Theatre), and as a member of the editorial staff she helped mainly with economic and production issues.\n\nAs the wife of the first Czechoslovak democratic president after February 1948, Olga Havel intensively focused on charitable activities. In the era of newly emerging democracy, she was a pioneer of charity in the country. In early 1990, she and her friends from Charta 77 founded the Committee of Good Will, one of the very first projects of this kind in Czechoslovakia. In 1992, she founded the Olga Havel Foundation and members of the Committee of Good Will became Board Members of the foundation with Olga as the Chair. The main objective of the Committee of Good Will - Olga Havel Foundation (OHF) was to help people with disabilities, abandoned or discriminated with their integration into society. The Foundation activities soon became well known abroad. In some countries in Europe and overseas, sister organizations were established to support the main goals of the Foundation.\nOlga Havel visited emerging centres for children with multiple disabilities to inquire what could make their life easier. She was often seen among senior citizens and handicapped children. She was interested in transformation of hospitals into non-profit, non-governmental organizations and urged ministers to support civil society organizations working in the social field. She earned respect of world politicians and cultural figures. She met outstanding personalities in and outside Europe; together with Christiane Herzog, wife of German President, she organized help for children suffering from cystic fibrosis.\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the OHF, Olga decided to present an award to a person with a handicap who helped to improve living conditions of other handicapped people. This prize is awarded annually in May. Olga attended just the first awards ceremony - she died in January 1996. The prize, a statue called Encouragement by Olbram Zoubek, thus also became a remembrance of a person who had always been an advocate for the rights of vulnerable citizens. One part of the Olga Havel Award project is to promote civic associations providing social and medical services in a dignified way, and using new forms of social services. For the OHF, the ceremony is also an opportunity to pay tribute to its significant donors and collaborators.\n\nIn 1991, Nordic foundation Stiftelsen Arets Budeje awarded Olga Havel with the prestigious prize Woman of the Year 1991. In 1995, Olga received the Přemysl Pitter medal and became the Woman of the year 1995 in the Czech Republic. Olga Havel dedicated last years of her life to tireless building of civil society. In 1995, Olga was according to the public survey the most significant woman of the Czech Republic and she became an authority even abroad. Thanks to her the issue of handicapped people stopped to be an \"indecent topic\".\n\nOlga Havel died of cancer on January 27, 1996. Her death deeply hit the entire nation. People stood in a long queue to honour her, laid flowers in the chapel at the south wing of Prague Castle, and signed a condolence book. She is buried in the Havel family tomb at Prague's Vinohrady cemetery.\n\nIn 1997, Olga Havel was in memoriam awarded the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk for outstanding contribution to democracy and human rights. Since 1996, based on approval of the President Václav Havel, secondary school in Ostrava-Poruba carries an honorary title – Olga Havel Gymnázium. In 2014, Business Academy, specialized school and practical school in Janské Lázně, which Olga Havel opened in 1994, was officially named after her.\n\nOlga Havel left neither letters nor a book of memories. People can learn about her life from the books by Pavel Kosatík or Helena Marková, from the tribute anthology Síla věcnosti (Power of factuality) and other texts. In 1993, the documentary was made within the cycle GEN – Galery of the nation's elite, in 2006 – on the occasion of 10th anniversary of her death – a documentary Paní Olga (Lady Olga) from the cycle Příběhy slavných (Stories of the famous). In 2014, director Miroslav Janek made the documentary OLGA, which was awarded in the category Best Documentary on the 22nd film awards Český lev (Czech Lion). In 2010, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the building where the Committee of Good Will is located (Prague, Senovážné náměstí 2); since 2012, a new street in Žižkov-Vackov bears the name of Olga Havel.\n\n\n"}

He held a number of ministerial positions within the governments of Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass.\n\nSmith was born in the town of Bailieborough, County Cavan. Patrick joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, he took a small role in the Easter Rising of 1916. By 1920, he was involved with the Irish Republican Army and was one of its youngest commandants, at the age of 19. He was captured by British forces in 1921, along with Seán Moylan, who would go on to become a government colleague. He was interned, put on trial treason but his life was saved by the truce called between the British Army and the IRA during the Irish War of Independence. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Smith took sides with de Valera and the Anti-Treaty side of the Irish Civil War. Smith had felt that the Irish negotiators did not test the British delegation enough, this sentiment would last with him well into his political career, Smith being said to have shouted across the floor at Dáil Éireann, \"They gave us stepping-stones, but they [state forces in 1922] would not walk on them.\" A play on the same quote by Irish revolutionary, Michael Collins.\n\nHe entered the Dáil in September 1923, as a Republican candidate. In 1926, Éamon de Valera, the Leader of Anti-Treaty Sinn Fein, approached Smith and persuaded him to join his newly founded political party, Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fail abandoned the abstentionist policy of Anti Treaty Sinn Fein and its elected members took their seats in Dáil Éireann. De Valera and Smith had a strong personal and professional relationship; Smith had a strong loyalty for Fianna Fail and by extension, de Valera, whom he often defended from allegations of totalitarian style policies. Smith retorted these allegations, citing that he felt de Valera had always given a voice to members of the party. He worked as Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach, known today as the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach or Government Chief Whip. Smith identified this time during World War II as his most fulfilling period in Irish politics.\n\nHe was then moved to the Department of Finance, as the respective Minister of State in that department. He served under Seán T. O'Kelly and Frank Aiken during his tenure in the department. Smith was then transferred to the Department of Agriculture and this was his first cabinet position as Minister for Agriculture. He held this position until the collapse of the Fianna Fail government which had been in power for over 10 years. The party spent a number years in opposition, until the 1951 Irish general election. Smith was then appointed as Minister for Local Government. Smith focused on many social issues, especially the tuberculosis issue in Ireland. He advocated for the reduction of overcrowding in the slums of Dublin. He also oversaw the doubling of the car license fee to ensure the government had enough cashflow for the upkeep of urban and rural roads. The improvement of roads also facilitated unemployment programs by offering recruitment opportunities to work on the roads. The fund for road improvement soon amounted to £3 million, and work began on surfacing the 34,000 miles of road which remained below standard. The Fianna Fail government collapsed in 1954 and was replaced by the Second Inter-Party Government, led by John A. Costello; Smith resumed his post in the Department of Local Government when Fianna Fail were re-elected at the 1957 Irish general election\n\nSmith was transferred to the Department of Agriculture for the final time in 1957 when Fianna Fail resumed its position in government. His main objectives while in this office were to eliminate cattle tuberculosis, which proved to be a serious issue for Irish farmers at the time. He also encouraged greater productivity from the primary economic sector, specifically farming and also aimed to improve grassland quality across the island. Outside of agriculture, Smith continued to serve as Minister for Local Government. He also was part of a group of ministers who supervised the \"'First Programme for Economic Expansion\"', an economic development plan by T. K. Whitaker, Secretary at the Department of Finance, that has been heavily praised as the programme that helped kickstart Ireland's economic growth which would take full form in the mid-1990's. He also had a spell as Minister for Social Welfare.\n\nSmith continued to serve under Seán Lemass, but became disillusioned with the Taoiseach about relations with trade unions. Smith, who felt Lemass was too close to unions and would too easily bend the knee, resigned from the government in 1964 from all his ministerial positions in protest. Smith returned to the backbenches of Fianna Fail and never returned to the frontbench in the subsequent government of Jack Lynch, the successor of Lemass. During the Arms Crisis, Smith, like many of the 'old guard' of Fianna Fail, sided with Lynch against Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. Smith stepped down from politics in 1977 at the age of 75. In the 1979 leadership election for Fianna Fail, Smith again sided with the more traditional members of the party in supporting the leadership campaign of George Colley, who was also endorsed by Lynch. Haughey won the election and would lead Fianna Fail until 1992.\n\nSmith died on 18 March 1982, aged 80, at his home in Castleblayney, County Monaghan. He was survived by his wife, Mary Ward and his 6 children. He body was returned to his ancestral parish of Knockbride, a townland outside of Bailieborough, County Cavan. He was buried in West Knockbride Chapel, with his graveside oration given by Charlie Haughey, who had been appointed Taoiseach a number of days earlier.\n\n \n"}

She was secretary to Ernest O. Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory, and to J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory. After the war she was executive assistant to directors of Scripps Institute of Oceanography and the National Accelerator Laboratory.\n\nA graduate of the University of California, from which she obtained a degree in political science, Priscilla Greene started working for Lawrence in February 1942, and then for Oppenheimer later that year. She arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on March 1943, and established the Los Alamos Laboratory's office. She became the office manager at Los Alamos, greeting visitors, answering the telephone, making travel arrangements, arranging security passes and accommodation, and taking notes of telephone calls. In September 1943, she married Robert Duffield, a chemist working at the Los Alamos laboratory, and changed her surname from Greene to Duffield.\n\nIn the post-war years, Duffield was secretary and executive assistant to Roger Revelle, the director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In November 1967, she became secretary and executive assistant to Robert R. Wilson, the founding director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, and once again she helped establish a new scientific laboratory on a new site. In later life she moved to Colorado, where she served on the board of the Uncompahgre Medical Clinic.\n\nPriscilla Greene was born in Berkeley, California, on April 8, 1918, and grew up in Corning, California. She entered the University of California, from which she obtained a degree in political science. After graduation, she studied and travelled in New York and Europe before returning to Berkeley, where she got a job as secretary to Ernest O. Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, in February 1942, replacing Helen Griggs, who had left to marry Glenn Seaborg.\n\nWhen J. Robert Oppenheimer began working on the nuclear weapon design for the Manhattan Project during World War II, Lawrence loaned Greene part-time to take dictation and do general secretarial work for Oppenheimer, while still working full-time for himself. \"When Robert returned from travel and told me that he had just been to a beautiful place, all I could say is, 'take me too!'\" she later recalled. Lawrence reluctantly let her go. She immediately started working for Oppenheimer full-time, taking over the disused office of a physics professor who was absent on leave in November 1942.\n\nGreene arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on March 18, 1943 with Oppenheimer's son Peter and his nurse. She found Los Alamos, New Mexico, \"a pretty appalling place. It was windy, dusty, cold, snowy... and nothing was finished.\" \"Everything was put together amazingly fast ... (but) it was nothing spectacular. There were unfinished buildings, mud and trucks everywhere.\" Since there was no telephone line to Los Alamos, the office was initially established at 109 East Palace in Santa Fe. There was no purchasing system in place either, so she bought a typewriter in Santa Fe with her own money. She would spend the rest of the war trying to get reimbursed for it.\n\nWhen the office moved to Los Alamos, Greene became the office manager, greeting visitors and answering the telephone. She would listen in on all of Oppenheimer's calls and take notes, except when the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., told her to get off the line. She typed Oppenheimer's correspondence. Numerous typed documents would end with \"JRO:pg\". She handled travel arrangements, security passes and accommodation. Alex Wellersten noted that: \n\nGreene married Robert Duffield, a chemist working on the project, in a ceremony at Dorothy McKibbin's house on September 5, 1943. McKibben had a local judge conduct the ceremony, but due to the project's security, he was not allowed to know the surnames of the couple. Nor was any family allowed to attend, although Greene's brother DeMotte, whom she had recruited to work on the project as a technician, was on hand to give the bride away, and guests included Robert Serber, Robert R. Wilson, Harold Agnew and Katherine Oppenheimer. Three weeks later everyone assembled there again for the wedding of her bridesmaid, Marjorie Hall, to Hugh Bradner.\n\nWhen Duffield became pregnant, she wanted to quit working, but the demands of the project were so great that Oppenheimer kept refusing her requests. He eventually recruited Anne Wilson from Groves's office as her replacement.\n\nAfter the war, Duffield became secretary and executive assistant to Roger Revelle, the director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. On November 6, 1967, she became secretary and executive assistant to Robert R. Wilson, the founding director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, and served in that capacity until December 31, 1972. Duffield likened this job to working for Oppenheimer at Los Alamos: \n\nDuffield moved to Norwood, Colorado, where she served on the board of the Uncompahgre Medical Clinic. She died of natural causes at her home there on July 21, 2009. She was survived by her daughters Deborah and Libby. Her husband Robert died in 2000.\n\n"}

Satoshi Nakamoto also created the bitcointalk forum, and posted the first message in 2009 under the pseudonym satoshi.\n\nIn October 2008, Nakamoto published a paper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing the bitcoin digital currency. It was titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\". In January 2009, Nakamoto released the first bitcoin software that launched the network and the first units of the bitcoin cryptocurrency, called \"bitcoins\". Satoshi Nakamoto released the Version 0.1 of bitcoin software on Sourceforge on 9 January 2009.\n\nNakamoto claimed that work on the writing of the code began in 2007. Nakamoto knew that due to its nature, the core design would have to be able to support a broad range of transaction types. The implemented solution enabled specialized codes and data fields from the start through the use of a predicative script.\n\nNakamoto created a website with the domain name bitcoin.org and continued to collaborate with other developers on the bitcoin software until mid-2010. Around this time, he handed over control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen, transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his involvement in the project. Until shortly before his absence and handover, Nakamoto made all modifications to the source code himself.\n\nOn 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the \"genesis block of bitcoin\" (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. Embedded in the coinbase transaction of this block was the text:\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\nThe text refers to a headline in \"The Times\" published on 3 January 2009. This note has been interpreted as both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking. It is a strong indication that the first block was mined no earlier than this date. The genesis block has a timestamp of 18:15:05 GMT on 3 January 2009. This block is unlike all other blocks in that it doesn't have a previous block to reference. This required the use of custom code to mine it. Timestamps for subsequent blocks indicate that Nakamoto did not try to mine all the early blocks solely for himself.\n\nAs initially the sole and subsequently the predominant miner, Nakamoto was awarded bitcoin at genesis and for 10 days afterwards. Except for test transactions these remain unspent since mid January 2009. The public bitcoin transaction log shows that Nakamoto's known addresses contain roughly one million bitcoins. At bitcoin's peak in December 2017, this was worth over US$19 billion, making Nakamoto possibly the 44th richest person in the world at the time.\n\nNakamoto has not disclosed any personal information when discussing technical matters. He provided some commentary on banking and fractional-reserve banking. On his P2P Foundation profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old male who lived in Japan, but some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his use of perfect English and his bitcoin software not being documented or labelled in Japanese.\n\nOccasional British English spelling and terminology (such as the phrase \"bloody hard\") in both source code comments and forum postings led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one individual in the consortium claiming to be him, was of Commonwealth origin. Moreover, the first bitcoin block that could only be mined by Satoshi contains the encoded text codice_1 which implies that he was reading London's \"The Times\" newspaper at the time of the inception of bitcoin.\n\nStefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. This was between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Japanese time, suggesting an unusual sleep pattern for someone presumably living in Japan. As this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time.\n\nNakamoto's initial email to Dai is dated <q>22 August 2008</q>; the metadata for this PDF (codice_2) yields as the codice_3 the value codice_4 – this implies 3 October 2008 or a bit over a month later, which is consistent with the local date mentioned in the Cypherpunk mailing list email. This is an earlier draft than the final draft on codice_5, which is dated codice_6 or 24 March 2009; the timezone differs: −7 vs −6.\n\nGavin Andresen has said of Nakamoto's code: \"He was a brilliant coder, but it was quirky\".\n\nThere is still doubt about the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nHal Finney (4 May 1956 – 28 August 2014) was a pre-bitcoin cryptographic pioneer and the first person (other than Nakamoto himself) to use the software, file bug reports, and make improvements. He also lived a few blocks from Dorian Nakamoto's family home, according to \"Forbes\" journalist Andy Greenberg. Greenberg asked the writing analysis consultancy Juola & Associates to compare a sample of Finney's writing to Satoshi Nakamoto's, and they found that it was the closest resemblance they had yet come across (including the candidates suggested by \"Newsweek\", \"Fast Company\", \"The New Yorker\", Ted Nelson and Skye Grey). Greenberg theorized that Finney may have been a ghostwriter on behalf of Nakamoto, or that he simply used his neighbor Dorian's identity as a \"drop\" or \"patsy whose personal information is used to hide online exploits\". However, after meeting Finney, seeing the emails between him and Nakamoto and his bitcoin wallet's history (including the very first bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto to him, which he forgot to pay back) and hearing his denial, Greenberg concluded that Finney was telling the truth. Juola & Associates also found that Nakamoto's emails to Finney more closely resemble Nakamoto's other writings than Finney's do. Finney's fellow extropian and sometimes co-blogger Robin Hanson assigned a subjective probability of \"at least\" 15% that \"Hal was more involved than he’s said\", before further evidence suggested that was not the case.\n\nIn December 2013, a blogger named Skye Grey linked Nick Szabo to the bitcoin whitepaper using a stylometric analysis. Szabo is a decentralized currency enthusiast and published a paper on \"bit gold\", which is considered a precursor to bitcoin. He is known to have been interested in using pseudonyms in the 1990s. In a May 2011 article, Szabo stated about the bitcoin creator: \"Myself, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).\"\n\nDetailed research by financial author Dominic Frisby provides much circumstantial evidence but, as he admits, no proof that Satoshi is Szabo. Speaking on RT's \"The Keiser Report\", he said \"I've concluded there is only one person in the whole world that has the sheer breadth but also the specificity of knowledge and it is this chap ...\". However, Szabo has denied being Satoshi. In a July 2014 email to Frisby, he said: 'Thanks for letting me know. I'm afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I'm used to it'. Nathaniel Popper wrote in the \"New York Times\" that \"the most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo.\"\n\nIn a high-profile 6 March 2014 article in the magazine \"Newsweek\", journalist Leah McGrath Goodman identified Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, whose birth name is Satoshi Nakamoto, as the Nakamoto in question. Besides his name, Goodman pointed to a number of facts that circumstantially suggested he was the bitcoin inventor. Trained as a physicist at Cal Poly University in Pomona, Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto was laid off twice in the early 1990s and turned libertarian, according to his daughter, and encouraged her to start her own business \"not under the government's thumb.\" In the article's seemingly biggest piece of evidence, Goodman wrote that when she asked him about bitcoin during a brief in-person interview, Nakamoto seemed to confirm his identity as the bitcoin founder by stating: \"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\"\nThe article's publication led to a flurry of media interest, including reporters camping out near Dorian Nakamoto's house and subtly chasing him by car when he drove to do an interview. However, during the subsequent full-length interview, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to bitcoin, saying he had never heard of the currency before, and that he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being about his previous work for military contractors, much of which was classified. In a Reddit \"ask-me-anything\" interview, he claimed he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being related to his work for Citibank. Later that day, the pseudonymous Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account posted its first message in five years, stating: \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\" However, it is generally believed that Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account had been hacked, and the message was not sent by him.\n\nOn 8 December 2015, \"Wired\" wrote that Craig Steven Wright, an Australian academic, \"either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did\". Craig Wright took down his Twitter account and neither he nor his ex-wife responded to press inquiries. The same day, Gizmodo published a story with evidence obtained by a hacker who supposedly broke into Wright's email accounts, claiming that Satoshi Nakamoto was a joint pseudonym for Craig Steven Wright and computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, who died in 2013. Wright's claim was supported by Jon Matonis (former director of the Bitcoin Foundation) & bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen as well as cryptographer Ian Grigg.\n\nA number of prominent bitcoin promoters remained unconvinced by the reports. Subsequent reports also raised the possibility that the evidence provided was an elaborate hoax, which \"Wired\" acknowledged \"cast doubt\" on their suggestion that Wright was Nakamoto. Bitcoin developer Peter Todd said that Wright's blog post, which appeared to contain cryptographic proof, actually contained nothing of the sort. Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence publicly provided by Wright does not prove anything, and security researcher Dan Kaminsky concluded Wright's claim was \"intentional scammery\".\n\nIn a 2011 article in \"The New Yorker\", Joshua Davis claimed to have narrowed down the identity of Nakamoto to a number of possible individuals, including the Finnish economic sociologist Dr. Vili Lehdonvirta and Irish student Michael Clear, then a graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College Dublin and now a post-doctoral student at Georgetown University. Clear strongly denied he was Nakamoto, as did Lehdonvirta.\n\nIn October 2011, writing for \"Fast Company\", investigative journalist Adam Penenberg cited circumstantial evidence suggesting Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry could be Nakamoto. They jointly filed a patent application that contained the phrase \"computationally impractical to reverse\" in 2008, which was also used in the bitcoin white paper by Nakamoto. The domain name bitcoin.org was registered three days after the patent was filed. All three men denied being Nakamoto when contacted by Penenberg.\n\nThe late Dave Kleiman has been also named as a possible candidate, and Craig Wright claimed an association with him as well.\n\nIn May 2013, Ted Nelson speculated that Nakamoto is really Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki. Later, an article was published in \"The Age\" newspaper that claimed that Mochizuki denied these speculations, but without attributing a source for the denial.\n\nA 2013 article in \"Vice\" listed Gavin Andresen, Jed McCaleb, or a government agency as possible candidates to be Nakamoto. Dustin D. Trammell, a Texas-based security researcher, was suggested as Nakamoto, but he publicly denied it.\n\nIn 2013, two Israeli mathematicians, Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, published a paper claiming a link between Nakamoto and Ross William Ulbricht. The two based their suspicion on an analysis of the network of bitcoin transactions, but later retracted their claim.\n\nSome have considered that Nakamoto might be a team of people: Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who read the bitcoin code, said that Nakamoto could either be a \"team of people\" or a \"genius\"; Laszlo Hanyecz, a former Bitcoin Core developer who had emailed Nakamoto, had the feeling the code was too well designed for one person.\n\nA 2017 article published by a former SpaceX intern espoused the possibility of SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk being the real Satoshi, based on Musk's technical expertise with financial software and history of publishing whitepapers. However, in a tweet on 28 November, Musk denied the claim.\n\n"}

Before the Civil War, he was a teacher, lawyer, judge and planter. He served for a year in the Provisional Confederate Congress from Texas. He was captured at the fall of Vicksburg, Mississippi on July 4, 1863 and exchanged in October 1863. After his promotion, Waul served in the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department. He was wounded at the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry. After the Civil War, Waul was a farmer and lawyer who lived in Texas until his death at age 90.\n\nThomas N. Waul was born January 5, 1813, in the Sumter District, now Sumter County, South Carolina, near Stateburg. He attended South Carolina College, now the University of South Carolina, until his junior year, then moved to Florence, Alabama, where he was a teacher. He moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1830 where he became a lawyer in 1835 and a judge. In 1850, he moved to Gonzales County, Texas, and became a planter. Waul made an unsuccessful run for a seat in the United States Congress in 1854. He served as a delegate to the Texas secession convention.\n\nThomas N. Waul was a member of the Provisional Confederate Congress from Texas between February 19, 1861, and February 17, 1862, when a permanent Confederate government was established. He served on the Committee on Commercial Affairs and Committee on Indian Affairs. He opposed the African slave trade as a diplomatic effort and restrictions on the cotton trade. He supported establishment of the central government, free trade, and local defense. Waul lost his run for a seat in the First Confederate Congress of the regular Congress of the Confederate States.\n\nOn May 17, 1862, Waul entered Confederate States Army service as colonel of Waul's Legion, which he recruited.\n\nWaul was captured when Vicksburg fell, on July 4, 1863. Waul was promoted to brigadier general on September 18, 1863, although he was not exchanged until October 16, 1863. His performance and leadership were commended by then Major General Stephen D. Lee. Waul then commanded a brigade in John G. Walker's Texas Division in the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department. Waul's brigade fought in the Red River Campaign at the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill, in Louisiana.\n\nOn April 30, 1864, after being transferred to Arkansas to oppose Union Major General Frederick Steele's Camden Expedition, Brigadier General Waul was wounded in the left arm at the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry. He returned to service in September 1864 and until December 1864 commanded Brigade I, Division I, I Corps of the Trans-Mississippi Department. From January 1865 to May 26, 1865, he commanded Brigade I, Division I, of the District of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona in the Trans-Mississippi Department. There is no record of his parole.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Waul returned to Texas where he was elected to the first Texas Reconstruction convention. After practicing law at Galveston, Waul retired to Hunt County, Texas, near Greenville, where he was a farmer. Thomas Neville Waul died in Hunt County, Texas, on July 28, 1903. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery at Fort Worth, Texas. Waul had no blood relatives at the time of his death.\n\n"}

It was built by Peter Madsen and Claus Nørregaard in 2001–2002, as a demonstrator to try submarine technology. Having made over 500 dives, it was decommissioned, as it was not designed for a long service life. It was decommissioned in 2006 after \"UC2 Kraka\" had been worked up. The submarine was then docked and allowed to decay. Final decontamination was done, and it was towed out to sea by \"UC3 Nautilus\", in August 2008, and sunk as an artificial reef near Copenhagen.\n\"Freya\" is named after the Norse goddess of fertility and love.\n\nThe sub was built at Peter Madsen's workshop in Farum, Denmark. \"Freya\" was completed in 2002. It was built with only an electric drive, a 3.1-kW Sauer-Danfoss 24V DC electric motor. Coupled with a 24V 200Ah Setronic-Flamm GS gel battery, this gave a range of , but a charging time of 24 hours. This gave a cruise radius of . The electric motor was sourced from a forklift. The sub had a service depth of , and a theoretical crush depth of . The sub was long, wide, and tall from keel to top of periscope. It could reach on the surface or submerged. \"Freya\" was not equipped with an air compressor, which limited the time length of dives. The sub could hold 2 people. As \"UC1\" was a prototype, it was built out of regular steel, for enhanced strength, over aluminum or fibreglass, and making it cheaper than stainless steel. Operating costs originally were about 6 DKK worth of electricity for a couple of hours cruising.\n\n\"Freya\" was completed in 2002, and she was put to sea, starting voyages.\nIn July 2002, out of the water for inspection and refit, it was crushed by a transport accident, when the truck it was on passed under a low bridge, and the attached crane was knocked over, crushing the conning tower and central portion. Insurance monies paid by the transport company were used to pay for repairs, making it seaworthy again, later in 2002. The repairs were done by Madsen and company.\n\nAfter decommissioning, it was sunk to the bottom of the Øresund.\n"}

After being promoted to corporal the following year, he deserted from the military in 1999, and began to work as an assassin for the Los Zetas and Gulf Cartel, a drug trafficking organization, along with other ex-soldiers. His life as an outlaw overwhelmed him, and he later committed suicide through a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nÓscar Eduardo Guerrero Silva was born in Reynosa, Tamaulipas around the year 1971, and joined the Mexican Army on 28 January 1992 as an infantry soldier. The following year, he was promoted to corporal. Nonetheless, he eventually deserted from the Armed Forces in 1999 and was recruited by the drug trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel, becoming one of the 50 most-wanted criminals in Mexico during his time.\n\nHe was recruited along with several other soldiers of the Mexican Army in the late 1990s by Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, to work as hired assassins and bodyguards, where he earned the alias \"Z-8\". The newly formed group founded by Guerrero Silva and other ex-soldiers became known as Los Zetas, and they were highly trained and equipped, enticed with greater salaries than in the Army. Los Zetas continued to expand by hiring former police officers and gang members alike, and diversified their criminal agenda aggressively by including kidnappings, extortions, oil theft, piracy, and other rackets into their revenue, instead of focusing solely on the international narcotics trade.\n\nOn December 2002, gunmen of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel wearing police uniforms raided a prison in Matamoros, Tamaulipas and liberated three men accused of drug trafficking and a woman imprisoned for homicide. The Mexican authorities alleged that Guerrero Silva was involved in the raid. Later on in January 2004, Apatzingán, Michoacán was the scene of a massive prison break when over 50 uniformed gunmen of Los Zetas, including Guerrero Silva, stormed several prison cells and liberated at least 25 inmates, including several high-ranking drug lords of the Gulf Cartel, in less than 15-minutes.\n\nGuerrero Silva was known for having one of the most bizarre and unique Mexican criminal nicknames, \"Winnie Pooh\", but he was \"hardly a lovable bear\".\n\nOn 1 February 2004, elements of the extinct Federal Investigative Agency (AFI) raided a residence at the Riveras del Río neighborhood in Guadalupe, Nuevo León, near the city of Monterrey, and discovered the corpse of Guerrero Silva. \n\nHis temple had a gunshot wound from a 9mm pistol, suggesting that his death was an apparent suicide. Guerrero Silva was reportedly overwhelmed after the Mexican authorities had him under surveillance and because he believed his own accomplices were going to betray him.\n\nGilberto López Barrera, the brother-in-law of Guerrero Silva and a member of Los Zetas drug cartel, was arrested in downtown Monterrey on 22 May 2005 and charged with a number of crimes. He is the brother of Ivonne López Barrera, a former romantic partner of Guerrero Silva.\n\nIn 1990, two years before joining the Mexican Army, Guerrero Silva married Gabriela Cervantes Zamorano. Both of them stopped seeing each other in 1997, and his wife later found out that he had deserted the military and was working for Los Zetas. Gabriela recalls that Guerrero Silva would send her money and call her on the phone every now and then, but that he seemed uninterested in their matrimony. Although married to Gabriela, Guerrero Silva had a romantic relationship with another woman, which explains why he visited Guadalupe, Nuevo León from Reynosa, Tamaulipas (his actual residence) periodically.\n\n"}
