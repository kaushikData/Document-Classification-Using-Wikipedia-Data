{"id": "38270135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38270135", "title": "Ainmanes", "text": "Ainmanes\n\nAin-manés are the ancestral homes of the native communities in Kodagu, and have an important role in their socio-cultural traditions. Each ainmané belongs to an okka (matrilineal clan) that is identified. The traditional ainmanés of Koḍagu have a unique architectural style. Those that are still standing today generally date from about 150 to 450 years ago, and have evolved from the simple balyamanés of earlier times. Currently there are about 1720 okkas in Koḍagu (including about 1040 Kodava, 320 Gowda and 360 okkas of other communities). Nearly 60% of them no longer have traditional ainmanés. \n\nThe people Kodagu are Hindus; they believe in reincarnation, revere the cow and originally worshipped the natural elements (revering the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, water and fire) and their ancestors. The reverence of various spirits in addition to the established gods of Hinduism is also part of their religion. Each village had a Bhagwathi (Mahalakshmi) temple, each lane had a snake deity and each nad(region) had an Aiyappa temple. The people worshipped Mahadeva as well. Comparatively liberal in their beliefs, the consumption of soma and pork is permitted during their ceremonies (except during Kaveri Sankramana when they have to be on a vegetarian, non-alcoholic diet). However like other Hindus, the consumption of beef is strictly prohibited. They maintained sacred groves on their public village lands from ancient times, hunting was prohibited in these woods called the Devakadu. They believe in astrology as well. Generally they didn't follow idol worship but believed in nature worship.\n\nPeople settlements in Coorg are in the form of Okka family groups that are scattered across agricultural and forested holdings, where traditional ainemane houses form focal meeting points in the rural landscape. It is a joint patrilineal clan with males of common ancestry. The male members of an okka share an okka name. Currently there are about 1000 okka names and families in Kodagu. Traditionally all the members of an okka lived in a large ancestral Ainemane house (ayyangada mane – House of the Elders). The emergence of townships, as such, has been a relatively recent phenomenon and many of the main towns in Kodagu are inhabited by recent migrants. This cluster of homes and property form the nucleus of a village called ur.\n\nThe spirits of departed souls who were prominent figures in the community and had done good deeds while they were alive were worshipped. These spirit gods do not have a set form of physical representation. Symbolically a piece of rock is sanctified and considered as such a spirit deity. The founder of each clan (Okka), the Guru Karana, is worshipped by the members of that particular clan. On their ancestral clan lands the have a shrine (Kaimada), which is the shrine of the clan's first ancestor (Guru Karana), where they offer prayers and obeisance. A number of weapons, made of wood or metal, are kept in the Kaimadas. The shrine is usually made of clay or wood or covered with sheet metal, and housed within a roofed structure built near the entrance to the ain-mane. Sometimes it is simply located on a platform under a sap-exuding tree near the entrance of ainemane. Some clans conduct a karana kola, a dance of the ancestral spirit during which a Malayalee migrant dresses in elaborate colourful clothing and dances in a trance and acts as an oracle. During this ceremony he is symbolically possessed by the karana, the original founder of the particular clan. In every home a lamp called Nellakki Deepa is lit in honour of the Guru Karana. The lamp in the central hall is lit by the embers of the kitchen hearth every day. Fire of the kitchen hearth is especially sacred.\n\nOn the day of Huttari (the rice harvest festival celebrated in around November–December), the whole family assembles in their ain mane (the common family house), which is decorated with flowers and green mango and banana leaves. Specific foods are prepared: thambuttu, puttari, kari and poli poli. Then the eldest member of the family hands a sickle to the head of the family and one of the women leads a procession to the paddy fields with a lit lamp in her hands. The path leading to the field is decorated. A gunshot is fired to mark the beginning of the harvest, with chanting of \"Poli Poli Deva\" (prosperity) by all present. Then the symbolic harvesting of the crop begins. The rice is cut and stacked and tied in odd numbers and is carried home to be offered to the gods. The younger generation then lite fire crackers and revel, symbolising prosperity. Groups of youngsters visit neighbouring houses and show off their dancing skills and are given monetary gifts. A week later, this money is pooled and the entire village celebrates a communal dinner. All family members gather for this meal.\n\nThe \"Pattole Palame\" was written using the Kannada script originally; it has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa, grandchildren of Nadikerianda Chinnappa, and has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi. The translators’ introduction explains: “Since the Kodava language does not have a script, he used the Kannada script that has been in vogue since the 17th century, when the Lingayat Rajas ruled Kodagu and Kannada was their court language.”\n\nNadikerianda Chinnappa had begun translating the work into English in 1925 but he died in 1931, before he could complete it. Chinnappa's daughter married into the Boverianda clan. His son and daughter-in-law were both teachers. Their daughter Nanjamma and Chinnappa's daughter's son, also called Chinnappa, cross-cousins, got married. Boverianda Chinnappa, an engineer with a degree from an Illinois university, and Nanjamma, a statistician who was a visiting fellow at Cambridge University in 1974, pursued their professions at Chennai, Kolkata and Canada. In the 1970s, Boverianda Chinnappa, Nanjamma's mother and Nanjamma began to copy out the Pattole Palome in longhand over almost three years. \n\nWhile they were searching for copies of the original edition of the Pattole Palome, a ninety-year-old farmer and self-taught folk artist, Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, responded to their advertisement. During his youth unable to afford the book he had copied out the entire text word by word under a kerosene lamp. This hardcover book he gifted to the Chinnappas. Nanjamma's parents assisted in translating and interpreting the text. In the second edition of ‘Pattole Palame” (or ‘Silken Lore’), published by the University of Mysore in 1975, the editor describes it as one of the earliest extensive collections of folklore from any Indian community. \n\nAfter retirement they settled down in Bangalore in 1995 and began to realise his cherished dream. Finally in 2003, they completed the work and it has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi. That same year it was released in Madikeri (Mercara). This book has become the chief text for the Coorgs. \n\nBoverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa have chalked out at least ten Kodagu-based projects for the future, including a directory of aine mane or ancestral homes, a lexicon of the Kodava language and a biography of the late Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, a self-taught folk artist. Presently they have been working on the ainemane project, this can be found on the Ainmanes website.\n\nBoverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa had undertaken a project to collect information regarding each and every Ainmane found in Kodagu, irrespective of the community or caste of the clan members residing in them. They visited many of them in the period between April 2003 and May 2008. They also collected oral legends and traditional information from the occupants of each of these functional Ainemanes. Along with this they also researched about the concerned clans from previously published written material, wherever possible. The information thus collected are now available on the Ainmanes website. They have also provided a glossary for the Kodava thakk words used in the site. The couple are currently working on a book “Ainmanés of Koḍagu” that will give an overview of the ancestral homes of Koḍagu and of their socio-cultural significance.\n\nThe objective of this web-site is to document the current status of the traditional ainmanés of all the communities in Koḍagu and thereby contribute to the archival records of the heritage and oralhistory of the people of Koḍagu. It provides insights into the social and religious customs and conventions of the communities in Kodagu and the way of life of the people. It will also serve to raise awareness of the value of these buildings and the need to preserve them, besides providing information for those studying the socio-cultural-architectural heritage of Kodagu.This web-site contains information on all the traditional ainmanés in Koḍagu that were functional when the Chinnappas visited them. It includes photographs and information on each ainmané and its okka. The information was collected from members of the okka present in the ainmané during the visits and from those contacted later by telephone. Where available, information was added from published articles and books.\nEvery ainmané in the web-site is identified by its mané péda, the village where it is located and the community to which it belongs. Entering the mané péda of the okka in the ‘Search window’ allows the user to retrieve the photos and information on the ainmané and the okka. A table listing the okkas visited in alphabetical order of their mané pédas along with the names of the villages where their ainmanés are located and the communities that the okkas belong to is provided. Similar tables in alphabetical order of village names and by community are also provided. Also included are sketch maps of Kodagu (in 9 sections) that show the location of each ainmané. The ainmanés are identified by numbers on the maps, and the index gives their mané pédas. A glossary gives the meanings of words in Koḍava language that are in the web-site. Accent marks in the glossary and the key to the transliteration provides a guide to the reader on the correct pronunciation of these words. The stories collected from the informants are oral narratives. \n\nIn 2014, Niyogi books has published their work titled 'Ainmanes of Kodagu'.\n"}

He received his secondary education at schools No. 25, 91 and 112 in Moscow. After graduation from grade 10, in 1972, he entered the Moscow Pedagogical Institute at the Faculty of Russian Language and Literature. During his studies he joined the hippy movement. Dvorkin sets out two completely different versions of deductions from the institute. According to the book \"Teachers and lessons: memories, stories, reflections\" (), together with the like-minded people, he prepared a work that was demonstrated on September 20, 1975 at an exhibition of avant-garde artists in one of the pavilions of the VDNKh; about this work and its authors — a group of hippies called \"Hair\", to which Alexander Dvorkin was close, — American magazine \"Time\" positively responded; as a consequence, in the autumn of 1975, Alexander Dvorkin was expelled from the third year of the institute \"for believers incompatible with those that should be in the future Soviet teacher\". According to the book \"My America\" (), he was not admitted to the fifth examination session and was expelled from the institute for poor academic performance and non-attendance in early 1975. March 6, 1977 Dvorkin emigrated from the USSR on an Israeli visa. He did not go to Israel, but went to the USA. He worked as a courier, waiter, copyist. In 1978, Dvorkin became a student at the Hunter College, where he continued to study Russian literature. Dvorkin was baptized in the New York church of Christ the Savior of the Orthodox Church in America on January 19, 1980. Dvorkin graduated as Bachelor of Arts in Russian Literature in 1980 at Hunter College in 1980. In 1980, he became a student of the St. Vladimir Orthodox Theological Seminary of the OCA in New York. Dvorkin graduated as Master of Divinity in 1983 at the Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York. In 1984, Dvorkin received American citizenship. In 1984, he enrolled in doctoral studies at the Department of Medieval History at Jesuit-affiliated independent school — Fordham University. Dvorkin graduated as Doctor of Philosophy in Medieval studies in 1988 at Fordham University (thesis \"Ivan the Terrible as a Religious Type\"; his mentor was John Meyendorff). In late 1988, Dvorkin moved to Washington, where he worked at the bureau of the Voice of America radio station. At the same time, he became the subdeacon and altar server of bishop in the Washington St. Nicholas Cathedral. In 1991, Dvorkin moved to Germany and started working for Radio Liberty. December 31, 1991 Dvorkin returned to Russia. He has appeared countless times on Russian television and many times on television in various Eastern-European countries. He has authored 16 books (on various cults, on Church history as well as autobiographical prose) and edited 3 more. The number of his publications and interviews (translated into 16 languages) exceeds 1000.\n\nHe is president of the Saint Ireneus of Lyons Informational Consultative Center, an anti-cult organisation registered in the Russian Federation as non-religious NGO, \nand since 2009 Vice-President of the European Federation of Centres of Research and Information on Sectarianism (FECRIS), an umbrella organization for anti-cult groups in Europe. Dvorkin is on the board of the Europe-wide counter-cult agency FECRIS. He is a professor of Church History and Cultic Studies at Saint Tikhon's Orthodox University, Moscow, Russia.\n\nIn 1993, with the blessing of Patriarch Alexy II, he established a Russian anti-cult organization currently called Association of Centres for the Study of Religions and Sects (RATsIRS). From that time on he has been extremely active in opposing cults and new religious movements through his publications.\n\nDvorkin is a critic of Scientology, which he regards as a dangerous cult. Church of Scientology-affiliated organizations describe him as an \"anti-religious extremist\", and compile negative information about him on their websites. In 1997, Scientology and several other new religious movements sued Dvorkin and the Russian Orthodox Church for defamation, but their case was dismissed.\n\nDvorkin has claimed that the followers of Nikolai Rerikh as well as Jehovah's Witnesses, Scientology, Hare Krishnas, Neo-Pagans, Neo-Pentecostals, and many others are \"totalitarian cults\". \"When a psychiatrist-academician (Dmitrieva, Sidorov) or an expert-psychologist of the Institute of Psychology of the Russian Academy of Sciences rely on the works by Dvorkin and Hassan, which do not belong to science, it is a symptom of degradation\", said Yuri Savenko, the President of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia.\n\nDvorkin supports himself and his family by teaching, but dedicates at least half of his working time to helping those harmed by cults. He travels regularly throughout Russia and Eastern Europe, running seminars and conferences.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16999842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16999842", "title": "Andrew Huang (hacker)", "text": "Andrew Huang (hacker)\n\nAndrew \"bunnie\" Huang (born 1975) is an American researcher and hacker, who holds a Ph.D in electrical engineering from MIT and is the author of the freely available 2003 book \"Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering\". As of 2012 he resides in Singapore.\n\nHuang attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992, earning a Ph.D in electrical engineering in 2002. He stated that he had 'flipped a coin' to determine whether to pursue biology or electronics. Huang is also a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.\n\nThe nickname bunnie is short for vorpalbunnie, a reference to the creature in both Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Moria, that he used as a BBS screen name.\n\nHuang was the hardware lead at Chumby; his responsibilities included the design and production of Chumby devices, as well as the strategic planning and ecosystem development of the broader Chumby hardware platform. \n\nHe has completed several major projects, ranging from hacking the Xbox, to designing the world's first fully integrated photonic-silicon chips running at 10 Gbit/s with Luxtera, Inc., to building some of the first prototype hardware for silicon nanowire device research with Caltech. Huang has also participated in the design of wireless transceivers for use in 802.11b and Bluetooth networks with Mobilian, graphics chips at Silicon Graphics, digital cinema codecs at Qualcomm, and autonomous robotic submarines during the 1999 competition held by the AUVSI that the MIT team won. He is also responsible for the \"un-design\" of many security systems, with an appetite for the challenge of digesting silicon-based hardware security.\n\nHuang was scheduled to appear as an expert witness in the trial United States v. Crippen to determine whether or not modding an Xbox violates sections of the DMCA. The case was dropped suddenly on the third day of trial before the jury sat by the US federal authorities who had initiated the action. The case was dismissed before Huang was called to give testimony.\n\nHe also created the open hardware Safecast Geiger Counter Reference Design, as a volunteer effort in response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, tsunami, and ensuing meltdown of Fukushima Daiichi. A project in collaboration with Jie Qi of the MIT Media Lab is Circuit Stickers, a peel-and-stick circuit system for crafting electronics. Huang was interviewed on Dave Jones' \"The Amp Hour\" in episode #84, where he talked about his electronics work in China and reverse engineering.\n\nHuang is a member of the advisory board for Crowd Supply, the crowdfunding platform that he used for Novena and \"The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen.\"\n\nHuang has a long and noted history with the reverse engineering and hacking of consumer products. His 2003 publication \"Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering\" was one of the first published works regarding the reverse engineering of a high end consumer product. He faced significant legal pressure from Microsoft to not reveal the details of his exploits, and the book itself reveals that he had received a letter from MIT, where he was at the time a student, informing him of their disavowal of any association with his project. Additionally, his publisher John Wiley & Sons had rescinded their intent to publish the book.\n\nIn part because of this response by MIT to his work, when the Institute was again put at the forefront of controversy in their handling of the criminal prosecution brought against Aaron Swartz, and his subsequent suicide, Huang released the book for free through No Starch Press, remarking that \"Without the right to tinker and explore, we risk becoming enslaved by technology; and the more we exercise the right to hack, the harder it will be to take that right away\".\n\nIn 2005, Huang worked with a team from the Electronic Frontier Foundation to develop code that interprets printer steganography markings.\n\nHuang created the NeTV in 2011, which was the first known public use of the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) 'master key'. The device uses the master key to implement a video overlay on existing HDCP-protected links, in a fashion which purportedly does not violate the DMCA. Both the hardware and firmware for the NeTV are openly available under the CC-BY-SA license.\n\nHe has also used reverse engineering techniques to reveal why certain MicroSD cards are poor in quality. In 2013, he presented results in collaboration with fellow Singapore developer Sean 'xobs' Cross revealing methods to load arbitrary code into microSD cards via backdoors built into the embedded controller.\n\nOn 21 July 2016, Huang and Edward Snowden, in a talk at MIT Media Lab’s Forbidden Research event, published research for a smartphone case, the so-called \"Introspection Engine\", that would monitor signals received and sent by that phone to provide an alert to the user if their phone is transmitting or receiving information when it shouldn't be (for example when it's turned off or in airplane mode), a feature described by Snowden to be useful for journalists or activists operating under hostile governments that would otherwise track their activities through their phones.\n\nIn 2013, Huang announced that he, again in collaboration with Cross, was at work developing a laptop called the \"Novena\". The laptop is the first of its kind, in that the hardware and software are entirely open and only include components where the manufacturing companies do not require non-disclosure agreements to obtain the documentation necessary for design. In addition to the normal laptop components, the \"Novena\" motherboard also includes an FPGA, dual Ethernet ports, a three-axis accelerometer, and easily augmentable hardware. On May 7, 2014 the Novena's crowdfunding campaign reached its goal of $250,000 and went on to raise a total of $722,880 without taking subsequent pre-orders into account. \n\nHuang is a contributing writer for MAKE magazine, as well as being a member of their technical advisory board. He has also written for Gizmodo and IEEE Spectrum.\n\nHe has also written extensively about manufacturing in China. In March 2016, Huang successfully completed the crowdfunding campaign for his book \"The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen\", a manual written to enable the English speaking electronics community to be able to navigate China's Huaqiangbei marketplace in Shenzhen, widely regarded as one of the world's premier electronics marketplaces and production hubs. He also appeared in Wired's 2016 documentary \"Inside Shenzhen: The Silicon Valley of hardware.\"\n\nIn July 2016, Huang became a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) that challenges the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). In the complaint, the EFF argue on behalf of Huang (and his company AlphaMax LLC.) that the \"anti-circumvention\" and \"anti-trafficking\" provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act threaten free speech.\n\nIn 2007, Huang received the Lewis Winner award for Best paper at ISSCC 2006 (A 10Gbit/s photonic modulator and WDM MUX/DEMUX integrated with electronics in 0.13 um SOI CMOS, Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2006. ISSCC 2006. Digest of Technical Papers.

He was the husband of Princess Margaret and brother-in-law of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nArmstrong-Jones was the only son from the marriage of the barrister Ronald Armstrong-Jones (1899–1966) and his first wife Anne Messel (later Countess of Rosse; 1902–1992). He was born at Eaton Terrace, Belgravia, in London. He was called \"Tony\" by his close relatives.\n\nArmstrong-Jones's paternal grandfather was Sir Robert Armstrong-Jones, the British psychiatrist and physician. His paternal grandmother, Margaret Armstrong-Jones (née Roberts), was the daughter of Sir Owen Roberts, the Welsh educationalist. A maternal uncle was Oliver Messel (1904–1978) and a maternal great-grandfather was the \"Punch\" cartoonist Linley Sambourne (1844–1910), and his great-great-uncle Alfred Messel was a well-known Berlin architect. Additionally, his great-great-grandmother, Frances Linley, was a first cousin of Elizabeth Linley, wife of Richard Brinsley Sheridan.\n\nArmstrong-Jones's parents divorced in 1935 when he was five years old. As a schoolboy he contracted polio while on holiday at their country home in Wales. During the six months that he was in Liverpool Royal Infirmary recuperating, his only family visits were from his sister Susan.\n\nArmstrong-Jones was educated at two independent boarding schools: firstly at Sandroyd School in Wiltshire from the autumn term of 1938 to 1943.\n\nArmstrong-Jones attended Eton College, beginning in the Michaelmas term of 1943. In March 1945, he qualified in the \"extra special weight\" class of the School Boxing Finals. He continued to box in 1946, gaining at least two flattering mentions in the \"Eton College Chronicle\". While on holiday at his father's family estate in North Wales (Plas Dinas), he was stricken with poliomyelitis. In 1947, he was a coxswain in Eton's traditional \"Fourth of June\" Daylight Procession of Boats.\n\nHe then matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied architecture but failed his second-year exams. He coxed the winning Cambridge boat in the 1950 Boat Race.\n\nAfter university, Armstrong-Jones began a career as a photographer in fashion, design and theatre. His stepmother had a friend who knew Baron the photographer; Baron visited Armstrong-Jones in his London flat, which doubled as his work studio. Baron, impressed, agreed to bring on Armstrong-Jones as an apprentice, first on a fee-paying basis but eventually, as his talent and skills became apparent to Baron, as a salaried associate.\n\nMuch of his early commissions were theatrical portraits, often with recommendations from his uncle Oliver Messel, and \"society\" portraits highly favoured in \"Tatler\", which, in addition to buying a lot of his photographs, gave him byline credit for the captions. He later became known for his royal studies, among which were the official portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh for their 1957 tour of Canada. He was also an early contributor to \"Queen\" magazine, the magazine founded by his friend Jocelyn Stevens.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Armstrong-Jones became the artistic adviser of \"The Sunday Times Magazine\", and by the 1970s had established himself as one of Britain's most respected photographers. Though his work included everything from fashion photography to documentary images of inner city life and the mentally ill, he is best known for his portraits of world notables, many of them published in \"Vogue\", \"Vanity Fair\", and \"The Daily Telegraph\" magazine. His subjects include Marlene Dietrich; Laurence Olivier; Maggie Smith; Leslie Caron; Lynn Fontanne; David Bowie; Elizabeth Taylor; Rupert Everett; Anthony Blunt; David Hockney; Princess Grace of Monaco; Diana, Princess of Wales; Barbara Cartland; Raine Spencer (when she was Lady Lewisham); Desmond Guinness; British prime minister Harold Macmillan; Iris Murdoch; Tom Stoppard; Vladimir Nabokov and J. R. R. Tolkien. Over 100 of his photographs are in the permanent collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London.\n\nIn 1968 he made his first documentary film, \"Don't Count the Candles\", for the US television network CBS, on the subject of ageing. It won seven awards including two Emmys. This was followed by \"Love of a kind\" (1969), about the British and animals, \"Born to be small\" (1971) about people of restricted growth and \"Happy being happy\" (1973).\n\nIn October 1981 a group portrait by Snowdon of the British rock band Queen was used on the cover of their \"Greatest Hits\" album. In 2000 A Snowdon portrait of Freddie Mercury was used on the cover of his \"The Solo Collection\" box set.\n\nIn 2000, Armstrong-Jones was given a retrospective exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, \"Photographs by Snowdon: A Retrospective\", which travelled to the Yale Center for British Art the following year. More than 180 of his photographs were displayed in an exhibition that honoured what the museums called \"a rounded career with sharp edges\".\n\nSnowdon was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society – he was awarded the Hood Medal of the Society in 1978 and the Progress Medal in 1985.\n\nIn 2006, Tomas Maier, creative director of the Italian fashion brand Bottega Veneta, sought Snowdon to photograph his Fall/Winter 2006 campaign.\n\nArmstrong-Jones co-designed (in 1963, with Frank Newby and Cedric Price) the \"Snowdon Aviary\" of the London Zoo (which opened in 1964); he later said it was one of his proudest creations, affectionately calling it the \"birdcage\". He also had a major role in designing the physical arrangements for the 1969 investiture of his nephew Prince Charles as Prince of Wales.\n\nHe was granted a patent for a type of electric wheelchair in 1971.\n\nDuring his royal marriage, he was patron of the National Youth Theatre, the Contemporary Art Society for Wales, the Welsh Theatre Company, and the Civic Trust for Wales. He was also President of the British Theatre Museum.\n\nIn June 1980 Lord Snowdon started an award scheme for disabled students. This scheme, administered by the Snowdon Trust, provides grants and scholarships for students with disabilities.\n\nIn the 1960s, he served in the capacity of a council member of the Polio Research Fund, as it was known before it was renamed the National Fund for Research into Crippling Diseases. He served as a trustee of the National Fund for Research into Crippling Diseases (since renamed Action Medical Research). He was president for England of the International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981. He was provost of the Royal College of Art from 1995 to 2003.\n\nSnowdon was married twice. He was married first to Princess Margaret (1960 to 1978), and second to Lucy Mary Lindsay-Hogg (1978 to 2000).\n\nIn February 1960, Snowdon, then known as Antony Armstrong-Jones, became engaged to the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and they married on 6 May 1960 at Westminster Abbey. The ceremony was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television. Despite the public enthusiasm, \"some critics disapproved of a commoner marrying into the royal family\". The couple made their home in apartments at Kensington Palace. He was created Earl of Snowdon and Viscount Linley, of Nymans in the County of Sussex, on 6 October 1961. The couple had two children: David, 2nd Earl of Snowdon, born 3 November 1961, and Lady Sarah, born 1 May 1964.\n\nThe marriage began to collapse early and publicly; various causes may have been behind the failure. On her side there was a penchant for late-night partying, while on Snowdon's an undisguised sexual profligacy. (\"'If it moves, he'll have it,' was the summing-up of one close friend.\") \"'[T]o most of the girls who worked in the Pimlico Road studio, there seemed little doubt that Tony was gay'. To which Tony responds: 'I didn't fall in love with boys - but a few men have been in love with me.'\" The authorized biography by Anne de Courcy (2008) reveals a series of affairs with women, including a 20-year relationship with his mistress Ann Hills, and that Armstrong-Jones did not deny that he was bisexual.\n\nIn his 2009 memoir, \"Redeeming Features\", British interior designer Nicholas Haslam claimed that he had an affair with Snowdon before the latter's marriage to Princess Margaret and that Snowdon had also been the lover of Tom Parr, another leading interior designer.\n\nThe couple remained married sixteen years. \"They were both pretty strong-willed and accustomed to having their own way, so there were bound to be collisions,\" according to de Courcy. His work also consumed a great deal of time. \"She expected her husband to be with her more, but one of Tony's strongest motivations was work.\" The marriage was accompanied by drugs, alcohol and bizarre behaviour by both parties, such as his leaving lists of \"things I hate about you\" for the princess to find between the pages of books she read. According to biographers Sarah Bradford, one note read: \"You look like a Jewish manicurist and I hate you\". When high society palled, Snowdon would escape to a hideaway cottage with his lovers or on overseas photographic assignments; \"[m]ost people, including the Royal Family, took his side.\" Among Snowdon's lovers in the late 1960s was Lady Jacqueline Rufus-Isaacs, daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Reading. In spite of her own affairs, Margaret was said to be particularly upset when hearing about this woman. They separated in 1976, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1978.\n\nIn 2004, \"The Telegraph\" reported that Snowdon had fathered an illegitimate daughter shortly before marrying Princess Margaret. Anne de Courcy reports the claim by Polly Fry, born on 28 May 1960, in the third week of Lord Snowdon's marriage to Princess Margaret, and brought up as a daughter of Jeremy Fry, inventor and member of the Fry's chocolate family, and his first wife, Camilla, that she was in fact Snowdon's daughter. Polly Fry asserted that a DNA test in 2004 proved Snowdon's paternity. Jeremy Fry rejected her claim, and Snowdon denied having taken a DNA test. However, four years later, he admitted that this account was true.\n\nAfter his divorce from Princess Margaret, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Mary Lindsay-Hogg (née Davies) on 15 December 1978. Armstrong-Jones's youngest daughter is Lady Frances Armstrong-Jones, a designer and board member of the Snowdon Trust. She was born on 17 July 1979 and married Rodolphe von Hofmannsthal in 2006. From 1976 until 1996, Snowdon also had a mistress, journalist Ann Hills. She died by suicide on 31 December 1996.\n\nThe couple separated in 2000 after the revelation that Snowdon, then aged 67, had fathered a son, Jasper William Oliver Cable-Alexander (born 30 April 1998), with Melanie Cable-Alexander, an editor at \"Country Life\" magazine.\n\nLord Snowdon died peacefully at his home in Kensington on 13 January 2017, aged 86.\n\nHis funeral took place on 20 January at St Baglan's Church in the remote village of Llanfaglan near Caernarfon. He was buried in the family plot in the churchyard.\n\n\nFollowing his wedding, Armstrong-Jones was granted an earldom and introduced to the House of Lords as the Earl of Snowdon on 28 February 1962. The awarding of the earldom was in line with the practice of granting titles upon marriage into the Royal Family. Snowdon was appointed Constable of Caernarfon Castle in 1963; as part of this role, he assisted in organising the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969.\n\nHe made his maiden speech in the House of Lords in April 1972 on the problems that disabled people suffered in everyday life. One of his last contributions to the Lords was in response to the Queen's Speech of 1992.\n\nOn 16 November 1999 Lord Snowdon was created Baron Armstrong-Jones, of Nymans in the County of West Sussex. This was a life peerage given to him so that he could keep his seat in the House of Lords after the hereditary peers had been excluded. An offer of a life peerage was made to all hereditary peers of the first creation (those for whom a peerage was originally created, as opposed to those who inherited a peerage from an ancestor) at that time. The government of the day had expected Lord Snowdon to follow the example of members of the royal family and turn down his right to a life peerage. At the time, Labour MP Fraser Kemp said he was \"shocked and surprised that someone who achieved their position in the House of Lords by virtue of marriage should accept a seat in the reformed Lords\".\n\nSnowdon retired from the House of Lords on 31 March 2016 having seldom attended nor claimed any expenses for many years.\n\n\n\n"}

A wingman, Falconer was one of the few players to transfer from Western Australia to Victoria before the relaxation of transfer conditions, but retired at the age of 27 to concentrate on his career in the public service. He remained involved with Hawthorn after his retirement from playing, and worked to oppose the proposed merger with the Melbourne Football Club in the early 1990s.\n\nFalconer was born in Perth, Western Australia, and attended Perth Modern School, playing football for the school team, as well as in representative sides. He played for the North Perth team in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (MJFA) before being recruited by West Perth, making his senior debut in 1952. In his first few seasons, Falconer was hampered by injury, missing a number of matches due to thigh and leg injuries during the 1953 and 1954 seasons. Having been an outstanding schoolboy cricketer, Falconer also played first-grade cricket for North Perth in the WACA District Cricket competition during the summer, batting left-handed. Outside of football, Falconer worked as a clerk at the Department of Supply, and was also a member of the Australian Army Reserve, with army training occasionally conflicting with games.\n\nAt the end of the 1955 season, Falconer was one of two players (the other being teammate Eddie Wylde) who were offered contracts by Hawthorn. West Perth coach Peter O'Donohue, who had previously captained Hawthorn, was involved in convincing Falconer to move to Melbourne, with an uncomplicated transfer between jobs in the Commonwealth Public Service also influential in his decision. The VFL's residency requirements meant Falconer was not able to play for the club until midway through the 1956 season. After a number of games for the reserves, in which he was a \"star on the wing\", according to \"The Argus\", Falconer made his debut for Hawthorn in round twelve, against . He played the remaining seven games of the season, and shared the club's \"Best First Year Player\" award with Brendan Edwards. Falconer established himself in Hawthorn's side in 1957, playing every game for the club, and was named the club's \"Most Consistent Player\" at the end of the season. In the first semi-final against , when much of the game was played during a hailstorm, he kicked a crucial goal right on the three-quarter time siren, having marked a soccer kick off the ground. A regular in the side throughout the following three seasons, Falconer's job restricted his ability to play in later seasons, and eventually forced his retirement from the club at the end of the 1960 season, although he did later play a handful of matches for Waverley in the Victorian Football Association (VFA).\n\nFalconer's work in the public service resulting in him moving to Canberra for a period of seventeen years, although he maintained a relationship with Hawthorn during that time, serving on the club's board in the 1960s and 1990s, and on the selection committee from 1965 to 1966. As a member of the committee of the Past Players and Officials Association, Falconer was active in opposing the proposed merger with , and later headed the Membership Policy Committee that was involved in doubling the club's membership in the late 1990s. Having worn the number 36 jumper during his time at the club, Falconer is one of the players involved in the so-called \"Curse of 36\". His 57 games for the club are the most of any player to wear the number, with other players who have worn the jumper having had an atypical lack of success at senior level.\n"}

Unrest on the eastern frontier, caused by conflicts with the Xhosa, increased the tension, especially after the Black Circuit in 1812.\n\nBezuidenhout was generally known as a difficult man; he was accused by his servant, Booi, of ill-treatment and of holding back his pay due to a theft accusation against Booi.\n\nHe was summoned to appear before the court at Graaff-Reinet. At first he sent poor excuses for his absence; but eventually defied the court's orders.\n\nAs a result, he was sentenced in his absence by a circuit court for contempt of court to a month's imprisonment. An order for his arrest was issued and landdrost Andries Stockenström of Graaff-Reinet instructed the Deputy-Messenger of the Court to carry out the order.\n\nReceiving no help from the Field Cornet of the ward, he proceeded to the nearest military post, commanded by Captain Andrews armed with a letter asked for military assistance. While Bezuidenhout was preparing to resist, by force, his arrest, Lieutenant F Rousseau accompanied the Deputy-Messenger with a patrol of twelve Khoikhoi soldiers.\n\nHe was confronted at the Baviaans River (the present Glen Lynden) on 16 October 1815. Bezuidenhout refused to surrender and fired on the soldiers. With his half-breed son and a casual visitor, Jacob Erasmus, sought refuge amongst the tumbled rocks of the nearby valley. He would not listen to reason and recommenced firing until he was mortally wounded by the soldiers returning the fire. His son and Erasmus, who took no part in the action, surrendered.\n\nBezuidenhout was buried on the farm the next day by his relatives.\n\nThere is no certainty about Bezuidenhout's wife or children, apart from one son, Gerrit Coenraad Bezuidenhout (1790-1838).\n\nThe cave in which Bezuidenhout died, and also his grave, are at Silverbrook farm, the present Glen Lynden in the Eastern Cape. The Dutch Reformed Church and the local Reddingsdaadbond erected an obelisk of red dolerite at the cave and a granite rock at the grave. These two memorials are about 200 yards apart on the road between Bedford and Tarkastad in the Eastern Cape province.\n\nAt Bezuidenhout's funeral, his brother, Johannes Jurgen (Hans Jan) Bezuidenhout, swore to avenge himself on the officials whom he held responsible for his brother's death.\n\nHe incited the whole community to resistance against British authority. He believed that his decision to chase the British and the Khoikhoi into the sea and to establish an independent state on the eastern frontier coincided with the wishes of all the burghers. About sixty burghers took an oath of vengeance and loyalty and took part in what became known as the Slachter's Nek Rebellion.\n\nThe Slachter's Nek Rebellion was an uprising by Boers in 1815 on the eastern border of the Cape Colony. The rebellion, which was small and local, was handled so badly that it acquired importance as an incident in the struggle of Afrikanerdom against British domination.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "163247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163247", "title": "Chinese name", "text": "Chinese name\n\nChinese personal names are names used by those from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and the Chinese diaspora overseas. Due to China's historical dominance of East Asian culture, many names used in Korea and Vietnam are adaptations of Chinese names, or have historical roots in Chinese, with appropriate adaptation to accommodate linguistic differences.\n\nModern Chinese names consist of a surname known as xing (, \"xìng\"), which comes first and is usually but not always monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called ming (, \"míng\"), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic. Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"courtesy name\" or \"style name\" called zi (, \"zì\") by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\nFrom at least the time of the Shang dynasty, the Han Chinese observed a number of naming taboos regulating who may or may not use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures—particularly emperors—used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the May Fourth Movement has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.\n\nAlthough some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as \"xìng\" () and \"míng\" (), are still used today, in ancient times they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st millennium BC, during the Zhou dynasty, members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different namespersonal names (\"míng\" 名), clan names (\"xìng\" 姓), lineage names (\"shì\" 氏), and \"style\" or \"courtesy\" names (\"zì\" 字)and up to two titles: standard titles (\"jué\" 爵), and posthumous titles (\"shì\" 諡 or \"shìhào\" 諡號). Commoners possessed only a personal name (\"ming\"), and the modern concept of a \"surname\" or \"family name\" did not yet exist at any level of society. The old lineage (\"shi\") and clan names (\"xing\") began to become \"family names\" in the modern sense and trickle down to commoners around 500 BC, during the late Spring and Autumn period, but the process took several centuries to complete, and it was not until the late Han dynasty (1st and 2nd centuries AD) that all Chinese commoners had surnames.\n\nAlthough there are currently over 4,000 Chinese surnames (, \"xìng\") in use in China, the colloquial expression for the \"Chinese people\" is Bǎixìng (百姓) \"Hundred Surnames\", and a mere hundred surnames still make up over 85% of China's 1.3 billion citizens. In fact, just the top three—Wang (王), Li (), and Zhang (張)—cover more than 20% of the population. This homogeneity results from the great majority of Han family names having only one character, while the small number of compound surnames is mostly restricted to minority groups. This has not always been true in Chinese history: between the first and fifth centuries AD, a law against multiple-character personal names briefly popularized two-character surnames and a number of important figures like Zhuge Liang and Sima Qian possessed them.\n\nChinese surnames arose from two separate prehistoric traditions: the \"xìng\" () and the \"shì\" (). The original \"xìng\" were clans of royalty at the Shang court and always included the 'woman' radical . The \"shì\" did not originate from families, but denoted fiefs, states, and titles granted or recognized by the Shang court. Apart from the Jiang () and Yao () families, the original \"xìng\" have nearly disappeared but the terms ironically reversed their meaning. \"Xìng\" is now used to describe the \"shì\" surnames which replaced them, while \"shì\" is used to refer to maiden names.\n\nThe enormous modern clans sometimes share ancestral halls with one another, but actually consist of many different lineages gathered under a single name. As an example, the surname Ma () includes descendants of the Warring States–era bureaucrat Zhao She, descendants of his subjects in his fief of Mafu, Koreans from an unrelated confederation, and Muslims from all over western China who chose it to honor Muhammad. Nonetheless, however tenuous these bonds sometimes are, it remains a minor taboo to marry someone with the same family name.\n\nTraditionally, a married woman keeps her name unchanged, without adopting her husband's surname. A child would inherit her father's surname. This is still the norm in mainland China, though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of greater China, such as Hong Kong and Macau, have also adopted the tradition of a woman changing her last name, or prepending her husband’s to her own.\n\nChinese given names (名字, \"míngzi\") show much greater diversity than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally to one or two syllables. Including variant forms, there are at least 106,000 individual Chinese characters, but as of 2006, in the People's Republic of China Public Security Bureau only approximately 32,000 are supported for computer input and even fewer are in common use. Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and tonal qualities, as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character \"ming\" may be chosen for each character's separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer 'means' anything.\n\nToday, two-character names are more common and make up more than 80% of Chinese names. However, this custom has been consistent only since the Ming dynasty. About 70% of all names were only one character long during the early Han and that rose beyond 98% after the usurping Wang Mang banned all two-character names outright. Although his Xin dynasty was short-lived, the law was not repealed until 400 years later, when northern invasions and interest in establishing lineages revived interest in such longer names. The Tang and Song saw populations with a majority of two-character names for the first time, but the Liao between them and the Yuan afterward both preferred single character names. The restoration of Han dominance under the Ming, promotion of Han culture under the Qing, and development of generation names established the current traditions.\n\nGiven names resonant of qualities which are perceived to be either masculine or feminine are frequently given, with males being linked with strength and firmness and females with beauty and flowers. It is also more common for female names to employ diminutives like \"Xiǎo\" or doubled characters in their formal names, although there are famous male examples such as Li Xiaoping and Yo-Yo Ma. People from the countryside previously often bore names that reflect rural life—for example, Daniu (, \"Big Ox\") and Dazhu (, \"Big Pole\")—but such names are becoming less common.\n\nIt is also considered bad form to name a child after a famous person, although tens of thousands might happen to share a common name such as \"Liu Xiang\". Similarly, owing to the traditional naming taboos, it is very uncommon in China to name a child directly after a relative, since such children would permit junior family members to inappropriately use the personal names of senior ones. Ancestors can leave a different kind of mark: Chinese naming schemes often employ a generation name. Every child recorded into the family records in each generation would share an identical character in their names. Sixteen, thirty-two, or more generations would be worked out in advance to form a generation poem. For example, the one selected in 1737 for the family of Mao Zedong read:\n\nThis scheme was in its fourteenth generation when Mao rejected it for the naming of his own children, preferring to give his sons the generational name An (, \"Lofty\", \"Proud\") instead. A similar practice was observed regarding the stage names of Chinese opera performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new \"given name\". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, Li Yuru adopted a name with the central character \"jade\" ().\n\nDepending on the region and particular family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys' generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, siblings' names are frequently related, so that a boy named Song (, \"Pine\") might have a sister named Mei (, \"Plum\"). In some famlies, the siblings' names have the same radical. For example, in the Jia (贾) clan in \"Dream of the Red Chamber\", a novel mirroring the rise and decline of the Qing Dynasty, there is Zheng (政), She (赦), and Min (敏) in the first generation, Lian (琏), Zhen (珍), and Huan (环) in the second, and Yun (芸), Qin (芹), and Lan (兰(蘭 at the time)) in the third.\n\nMore recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of Chinese history. For example, following the victory of the Communists in the Civil War, many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo (, \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng (, \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on Taiwan, it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"Republic of China\" (, \"Zhōnghuá Mínguó\") into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and five element practices.\n\nThe process of converting Chinese names into a phonetic alphabet is called romanization.\n\nIn mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the Hanyu Pinyin system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed, it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of Singapore, the United Nations, and the International Organization for Standardization. After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its \"New Phonetic System\" in 2009, although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via tone marks. In Pinyin, 毛澤東 is written as Máo Zédōng.\n\nProper use of Pinyin (\"romanization\") means treating the surname and given name as precisely two separate words with no spaces between the letters of multiple Chinese characters. For example, \"王秀英\" is properly rendered either with its tone marks as \"Wáng Xiùyīng\" or without as \"Wang Xiuying\", but should not be written as \"Wang Xiu Ying\", \"Wang XiuYing\", \"Wangxiuying\", and so on. In the rare cases where a surname consists of more than one character, it too should be written as a unit: \"Sima Qian\", not \"Si Ma Qian\" or \"Si Maqian\". However, as the Chinese language makes almost no use of spaces, native speakers often do not know these rules and simply put a space between each Chinese character of their name, causing those used to alphabetical languages to think of the \"xing\" and \"ming\" as three words instead of two.\n\nThe switch to Pinyin is still quite new for Taiwan and many non-standard spellings continue to be found, including \"Lee\" and \"Soong\". Similarly, many Taiwanese and historic names still employ the older Wade–Giles system. This English-influenced system is identified by its use of the digraphs \"hs\" (for the pinyin \"x\") and \"ts\" (for the pinyin \"z\" and \"c\") and by its use of hyphens to connect the syllables of multi-character words. Correct reading depends on the inclusion of superscript numbers and the use of apostrophes to distinguish between different consonants, but in practice both of these are commonly omitted. In Wade–Giles, 毛澤東 is written as Mao Tse-tung, as the system hyphenates names between the characters. For example, Wang Xiuying and Sima Qian are written in Wade as \"Wang Hsiu-Ying\" and \"SsuMa Ch'ien\".\n\nPinyin and Wade-Giles both represent the pronunciation of Mandarin, based on the Beijing dialect. In Hong Kong, Macau, and the diaspora communities in southeast Asia and abroad, the Chinese often romanize according to the sounds of their own local Chinese dialect or lingua franca or language mostly spoken in the area or country they settled into, particularly Cantonese, Hokkien, and Hakka. This occurs amid a plethora of competing romanization systems. In Hong Kong, many Chinese who grew up under the British occupation adopted English spelling conventions for their names: \"Lee\" for 李, \"Shaw\" for 邵, and so forth. In Macau, Chinese names are similarly sometimes still transliterated based on Portuguese orthography and Yuetping. The Chinese from Hong Kong, Macau and the diaspora communities in Malaysia and Singapore fully divide the characters in their names with spaces as a matter of course.\n\nA final point is that—although characters have remained roughly the same since the Han dynasty and some classical grammar is still part of the core curriculum of Chinese secondary schools—vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have all changed from Old to Middle to Modern Chinese even within the prestige dialects. Thus, although modern Chinese read \"Confucius\" () as \"Kǒng Fūzǐ\" via Pinyin Of course, at the time, he was addressed by his courtesy name (, \"Zhòngní\") instead.\n\nFrom their earliest recorded history, the Chinese observed a number of naming taboos, avoiding the names of their elders, ancestors, and rulers out of respect and fear. As a result, the upper classes of traditional Chinese culture typically employed a variety of names over the course of their lives, and the emperors and sanctified deceased had still others.\n\nCurrent naming practices are more straightforward and consistent, but a few pseudonyms or alternate names remain common.\n\nWhen discussing Chinese writers, Chinese and Japanese scholars do not consistently use particular names, whether they are private names or alternative names.\n\n\nTraditionally, babies were named a hundred days after their birth; modern naming laws in the People's Republic of China grant the parents a month before requiring the baby to be registered. Upon birth, the parents often use a \"milk name\" (, \"rǔmíng\"; )—typically employing diminutives like \"xiǎo\" (, \"little\") or doubled characters—before a formal name is settled upon, often in consultation with the grandparents. The milk name may be abandoned but is often continued as a form of familial nickname. A tradition sometimes attached to the milk name is to select an unpleasant name, in order to ward off demons who might wish to harm the child.\n\nNicknames ( ,  , \"chuòhào\", or , \"wàihào\") are acquired in China in much the same way they are in other countries. Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English—such as \"Little Fatty\" ()—are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing \"Ā-\" () or \"Xiǎo\" () to the surname or the second character of the given name. \"Ā-\" is more common in southern China and abroad, while \"Xiǎo\" is common throughout China. Both \"Ā-\" and \"Xiǎo\" are distinguished from \"Lǎo\" (, \"old\" but see below for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is A-bian.\n\nEnglish is taught throughout China's secondary schools and the English language section is a required component of the \"Gaokao\", China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire English names, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names for a variety of reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with Chinese tones and the modern Chinese tendency to regard foreign names as modern or egalitarian. The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names like Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale are pretty common, and even the real English names chosen by Chinese often tend to be rarely used by native English speakers. Creative names made and adopted by Hongkongers are generated by modifying normal English names either by deleting, inserting or substituting specific letters (e.g. Kith, Sonija, Garbie) or by mimicking the phonetic sounds of the Chinese name (e.g. Hacken Lee from Lee Hak-kan (李克勤)). \n\nIn Hong Kong, because of its one and a half century British rule, many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as attending English classes in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to Singapore, which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among Hongkongers to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.\n\nIt is also becoming more popular for parents to give their child a middle name in between their given name and family name, similar to many Western traditions.\n\nThe school name ( , , \"xuémíng\") was a separate formal name used by the child while they were at school.\n\nAs binomial nomenclature is also called \"xuémíng\" in Chinese, the school name is also sometimes now referenced as the \"xùnmíng\" () to avoid confusion.\n\nUpon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a courtesy name (, \"zì\" or , \"biǎozì\") either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection. The name commonly mirrored the meaning of one's given name or displayed his birth order within his family.\n\nThe practice was a consequence of admonitions in the \"Book of Rites\" that among adults it is disrespectful to be addressed by one's given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one's elders, while the courtesy name was employed by peers on formal occasions and in writing. The practice was decried by the May Fourth Movement and has been largely abandoned.\n\nPseudonyms or aliases ( , , \"hào\") or pen names ( , , \"bǐmíng\") were self-selected alternative courtesy names, most commonly three or four characters long. They may have originated from too many people having the same courtesy name.\n\nSome—but by no means most—authors do continue to employ stylized pen names. A noted example is the exile and dissident poet Zhao Zhenkai, whose pen name is \"Bei Dao\" (, \"North Island\").\n\nPosthumous names ( , , \"shìhào\") were honorary names selected after a person's death, used extensively for royalty. The common \"names\" of most Chinese emperors before the Tang dynasty—with the pointed exception of Shi Huangdi—are their posthumous ones. In addition to emperors, successful courtiers and politicians such as Sun Yat-sen also occasionally received posthumous titles.\n\nThe temple name ( , , \"miàohào\") of the emperor inscribed on the spiritual tablets of the imperial ancestral temple often differed from his posthumous name. The structure eventually became highly restricted, consisting of a single adjective and either \"zǔ\" () or \"zōng\" (). These common \"names\" of the emperors between the Tang and the Yuan are their temple ones.\n\nThe era name (, \"niánhào\") arose from the custom of dating years by the reigns of the ruling emperors. Under the Han, the practice began of changing regnal names as means of dispensing with bad luck and attracting better. Almost all era names were literary and employed exactly two characters. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, emperors had largely dispensed with the practice and kept a single era name during their reign, such that it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names.\n\nWithin families, it is often considered inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and birth order (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).\n\nThe hierarchical titles of junior relatives are seldom used except in formal situations, or as indirect reference when speaking to family members who are even younger than the person in question. Children can be called by their given names, or their parents may use their nicknames.\n\nWhen speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title, for example Mother Li () or Mrs. Zhu (朱太太, ). Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children, although, unlike in the west, referring to somebody by their full name (including surname) is common even among friends, especially if the person's full name is only two syllables. It is common to refer to a person as \"lǎo\" (老, old) or \"xiǎo\" (小, young) followed by their family name, thus Lǎo Wáng (老王) or Xiǎo Zhāng (小張, 小张). Xiǎo is also frequently used as a diminutive, when it is typically paired with the second or only character in a person's name, rather than the surname. Note that because old people are well respected in Chinese society, \"lǎo\" (old) does not carry disrespect, offense or any negative implications even if it is used to refer to an older woman. Despite this, it is advisable for non-Chinese to avoid calling a person xiǎo-something or lǎo-something unless they are so-called by other Chinese people and it is clear that the appellation is acceptable and widely used. Otherwise, the use of the person's full name, or alternatively, their surname followed by xiānsheng (, mister) or nǚshì (, madam) is relatively neutral and unlikely to cause offense.\n\nWithin school settings and when addressing former classmates, it is common to refer to them as older siblings, e.g elder brother Zhao () or e.g. elder sister Zhang () if they were of senior classes, or simply to show respect or closeness. The opposite (e.g. younger brother Zhao) is rarely used. This custom spawns from traditional forms of respectful address, where it was considered rude to directly address your seniors.\n\nWhereas titles in many cultures are commonly solely determined by gender and, in some cases, marital status, the occupation or even work title of a person can be used as a title as a sign of respect in common address in Chinese culture. Because of the prestigious position of a teacher in traditional culture, a teacher is invariably addressed as such by his or her students (e.g. ), and commonly by others as a mark of respect. Where applicable, \"Teacher Surname\" is considered more respectful than \"Mr/Mrs/Miss Surname\" in Chinese. A professor is also commonly addressed as \"teacher\", though \"professor\" is also accepted as a respectful title. By extension, a junior or less experienced member of a work place or profession would address a more senior member as \"Teacher\".\n\nSimilarly, engineers are often addressed as such, though often shortened to simply the first character of the word \"engineer\" -- . Should the person being addressed be the head of a company (or simply the middle manager of another company to whom you would like to show respect), one might equally address them by the title \"zŏng\" (), which means \"general\" or \"overall\", and is the first character of titles such as \"Director General\" or \"General Manager\" (e.g. ), or, if they are slightly lower down on the corporate hierarchy but nonetheless a manager, by affixing Jīnglĭ (, manager).\n\nBecause the small number of Chinese surnames leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the Chinese public security bureau stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.\n\nBeginning in at least 2003, the PRC government has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, which would be the pool of characters to select from when a child is given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.\n\nWang Daliang, a China Youth University for Political Sciences linguistics scholar, said that \"Using obscure names to avoid duplication of names or to be unique is not good. Now a lot of people are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication.\" Zhou Youyong, the dean of the Southeast University law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Han Chinese names consist of two or three characters, there are some Han Chinese with longer names, up to 15 characters. In addition, transliteration of ethnic languages into Chinese characters often results in long names.\n\nHan family names on Taiwan are similar to those in southeast China, as most families trace their origins to places such as Fujian and Guangdong. The Taiwanese aborigines have also adopted Chinese names as part of their Sinicization. The popularity distribution of family names in Taiwan as a whole differs somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese, with the family name Chen () being particularly more common (about 11% on Taiwan, compared with about 3% on the Mainland). Local variations also exist.\n\nGiven names that consist of one character are much less common on Taiwan than on the mainland.\n\nA traditional practice, now largely supplanted, was choosing deliberately unpleasant given names to ward off bad omens and evil spirits. For example, a boy facing a serious illness might be renamed Ti-sái (, \"Pig Shit\") to indicate to the evil spirits that he was not worth their trouble. Similarly, a girl from a poor family might have the name Bóng-chī (, \"No Takers\").\n\nNicknames (, \"gín-á-miâ\", \"child names\") are common and generally adopt the Southern Chinese practice of affixing the prefix \"A-\" () to the last syllable of a person's name. Although these names are rarely used in formal contexts, there are a few public figures who are well known by their nicknames, including former president A-bian and the singer A-mei.\n\nAmong Chinese Americans, it is common practice to be referred to primarily by the Western name and to use the Chinese given name as an often-omitted middle name.\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, it is equally acceptable for Western names to appear before or after the Chinese given name, in Latin characters. Thus, the Singaporean President Tony Tan might see his name written as \"Tony Tan Keng Yam\" or \"Tan Keng Yam Tony\". Individuals are free to register their legal names in either format on their identity cards. In general use, the English name first version is typically preferred as it keeps the correct order for both systems; however, for administrative purposes, the government agencies tend to place the English name last to organize lists of names and databases more easily, similar to the Western practice of organizing names with the last name first followed by a comma (\"Smith, John\").\n\nThe Hong Kong printed media tend to adopt the hybrid name style—for example, Andy Lau Tak-wah—although some people prefer American-style middle names, such as Steven N. S. Cheung, or simply use English names like Henry Lee. On official records such as the Hong Kong Identity Cards, family names are always printed first in all-caps Latin characters and followed by a comma for all names, including Chinese ones. Thus, the examples above would have identity cards that read \"LAU, Tak-wah Andy\" or \"CHEUNG, Steven Ng-sheong\", with the position of the given names determined at the time of application. Non-Chinese names are printed in similar style: \"DOE, Jane\".\n\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside China, rarely reverse their names to the western naming order (given name, then family name). Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. Beginning in the early 1980s, in regards to people from Mainland China, western publications began using the Hanyu Pinyin romanization system instead of earlier romanization systems; this resulted from the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China in 1979.\n\nThe usual presentation of Chinese names in English differs from the usual presentations of modern Japanese names, since modern Japanese names are usually reversed to fit the western order in English. In English the presentation of Chinese names is similar to those of Korean names. As of 1989, Pinyin became the preferred romanization system in works discussing contemporary China, while English-language books relevant to Japanese history still used the Wade–Giles system to romanize Chinese names more often than other romanization systems. As of 1993, Wade–Giles was still used in Taiwan. Unlike mainland Chinese, Taiwanese people usually place a dash between the two characters of the given name, similar to Korean names. This is also the case for the standard styling of Hong Kong Chinese names, where the given name is hyphenated. Names of Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese people are often expressed in three parts (e.g., Goh Chok Tong).\n\nAccording to the \"Chicago Manual of Style\", Chinese names are indexed by the family name with no inversion and no comma, unless it is of a Chinese person who has adopted a Western name.\n\nIn the Japanese language, Chinese names can be pronounced either approximating the original Chinese, the Local reading (現地読み) of the characters, or using a Sino-Japanese On'yomi reading (音読み) to pronounce the Chinese characters. Local readings are often written in katakana rather than kanji, but not always. For example, 毛泽东 (Mao Zedong) is pronounced Mō Takutō using an On'yomi reading, whereas Beijing (北京) is spelled with kanji but pronounced Pekin (ペキン), with a local reading (which may also be considered a post-Tōsō-on reading), rather than Hokkyō (which would be the Kan-on reading).\n\n\nKinds of Chinese group-names:\n\n\nOther links:\n\n"}

She was the eldest of the two daughters of Augustus and Elizabeth Jane Mordan. Her sister Ada married and had children but Clara was concerned that marriage would mean surrendering the control of her money to her husband. She was engaged but her attentions turned to the cause of women's rights. She was inspired by a lecture by John Stuart Mill in 1866. Mordan was given a lot of financial freedom by her father and she established her own home and household.\n\nAfter 1880 she joined the London Women's Suffrage Society and the Central Society for Women's Suffrage. Despite suffering from tuberculosis she served on their executive committees, had letterheads made with \"Votes for Women on them, and she was generous with her funding to these causes. \n\n1897 saw her second interest develop. She heard a paper read by Annie Rogers in London about the need for better women's education. This was just after a proposal to allow women to be awarded degrees was defeated. Mordan had no formal education; she is thought to have been educated at home by governesses, but she wanted to support the idea. She set out with her friend Mary Gray Allen to decide the best deserving college and St Hugh's College, Oxford was identified. She contracted to supply an annuity of £40 per annum to fund a scholarship on the condition that there was no vivisection involved in the recipients research.\nIn 1901 her father died. She was now the only child and he left £117,000. In 1906 after many years of interest she joined the militant Women's Social and Political Union which was led by Emmeline Pankhurst, but it was a speech by Annie Kenney that inspired her. Moreover she has the distinction of being their first benefactor of their newly founded WSPU campaign fund. Annie Kenney went round to see her after the event to thank her for the twenty pounds she had sent them towards their expenses.\n\nShe spoke on their behalf and attended protest meetings. The 1908 WSPU procession was said to be mainly funded by Mordan and when the protesters reached Hyde Park they listened to speeches including one by Mordan. She funded a variety of projects from a WSPU Art exhibition at the Prince's Skating Club in 1909 to $200 set aside for a \"return to militancy\" in 1912.\n\nMordan was invited to Eagle House in Batheaston on 27 April 1910 to plant a holly tree. Eagle House was where Mary Blathwayt's family entertained visitors at their \"Suffragette's Rest\". Many notable supporters were invited to the house. Emily Blathwayt planted trees and shrubs in \"Annie's Arboretum\" to commemorate achievements and her husband recorded these in photographs. The arboreturm was named after Annie Kenney and she had a room at Eagle House.\n\nWith Mordan's backing, St Hugh's College, Oxford bought a house called \"The Mount\" from University College and began to move to their new permanent site in 1913. The house was demolished to make way for the Main Building of the college which was funded by Mordan. Mordan died in Bexhill-on-Sea in 1915. She was given regular updates and in reply she had said that the college was one of her proudest achievements. St Hughes College named their new library Mordan Hall in recognition of her contributions to the college. Mordan left most of her wealth to Mary Gray Allen who had shared her life. When Allen died she left a large bequest to St Hugh's college.\n"}

Convicted in 1983 for the murder of an elderly woman, Bozella served 26 years in prison before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\n\nBozella was nine when his father beat his pregnant mother so badly that she later died. He was a witness to the beating. His father ran away and never returned. One of his brothers was stabbed to death, another was shot and killed, and a third died of AIDS. As a teenager, Bozella trained for a time with former world champion boxer Floyd Patterson. At 20, Bozella was sentenced to nearly three years in prison for attempted robbery. He earned a bachelor's degree from Mercy College and a master’s from New York Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1977, 92-year-old Emma Crapser was murdered in her Poughkeepsie, New York apartment. Police alleged that Crapser walked in on a burglary that was being committed by a then 18-year-old Bozella, who then killed her. In 1983, Bozella was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He continued to claim he was innocent and refused to admit to the crimes he was alleged to have committed, even when in front of the parole board, who denied him parole on four occasions. Bozella contacted the Innocence Project, who agreed to examine his case. When the Innocence Project discovered that there was no DNA evidence remaining to be tested, they referred the case to WilmerHale. Lawyers at WilmerHale discovered new evidence that had been suppressed by prosecutors showing Bozella was in fact innocent and had been framed. Supreme Court Justice James Rooney of Putnam County agreed that the Dutchess County District Attorney, John King, had failed to disclose crucial evidence which would have proved Bozella's innocence. On October 28, 2009, Bozella was finally released from prison after serving 26 years.\n\nBozella was imprisoned in New York State, including at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York. While incarcerated at Sing Sing, he became the prison's light heavyweight boxing champion.\n\nOn October 28, 2009, after being released from custody, Bozella began working with youths at a local gym in Newburgh, New York.

{"id": "863299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=863299", "title": "Diponegoro", "text": "Diponegoro\n\nPrince Diponegoro (born \"Bendara Raden Mas Mustahar\"; later \"Bendara Raden Mas Antawirya\") (11 November 1785 – 8 January 1855), also known as Dipanegara, was a Javanese prince who opposed the Dutch colonial rule. The eldest son of the Yogyakartan Sultan Hamengkubuwono III, he played an important role in the Java War between 1825 and 1830. After his defeat and capture, he was exiled to Makassar, where he died.\n\nHis five-year struggle against the Dutch control of Java has become celebrated by Indonesians throughout the years, acting as a source of inspiration for the fighters in the Indonesian National Revolution and nationalism in modern-day Indonesia among others. He is a national hero in Indonesia.\n\nDiponegoro was born on 11 November 1785 in Yogyakarta, and was the eldest son of Sultan Hamengkubuwono III of Yogyakarta. During his youth at the Yogyakartan court, major occurrences such as the dissolution of the VOC, the British invasion of Java, and subsequent return to Dutch rule. During the invasion, the Sultan Hamengkubuwono II, pushed aside in his power on 1810 in favor of Diponegoro's father, used the general disruption to regain control. In 1812 however he was once more removed from the throne and exiled off-Java by the British forces. In this process, Diponegoro acted as an adviser to his father and had apparently provided aid to the British forces to the point where Raffles offered him the \"Sultan\" title which he declined, perhaps due to the fact that his father was still reigning.\n\nWhen the sultan died in 1814, Diponegoro was passed over for the succession to the throne in favor of his younger half brother, Hamengkubuwono IV (r. 1814-1821), who was supported by the Dutch despite the late Sultan's urging for Diponegoro to be the next Sultan. Being a devout Muslim, Diponegoro was alarmed by the relaxing of religious observance at his half brother's court in contrast with his own life of seclusion, as well as by the court's pro-Dutch policy.\n\nIn 1821, famine and plague spread in Java. Hamengkubuwono IV died on 1822 under mysterious circumstances, leaving only an infant son as heir. When the year-old boy was appointed as Sultan Hamengkubuwono V, there was a dispute over his guardianship. Diponegoro was again passed over, though he believed he had been promised the right to succeed his half brother - even though such a succession was illegal under Islamic rules. This series of natural disasters and political upheavals finally erupted into full-scale rebellion.\n\nDutch colonial rule was becoming unpopular among local farmers because of tax rises, crop failures and among Javanese nobles because the Dutch colonial authorities deprived them of their right to lease land. Diponogoro was widely believed to be the Ratu Adil, the just ruler predicted in the Pralembang Jayabaya. Mount Merapi's eruption in 1822 and a cholera epidemic in 1824 furthered the view that a cataclysm is inbound, eliciting widespread support for Diponegoro.\n\nIn the days leading up to the war's outbreak, no action was taken by local Dutch officials although rumors of his upcoming insurrection had been floating about. Prophesies and stories, ranging from visions from the tomb of Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa to his contact with Nyai Roro Kidul, spread across the populace.\n\nThe beginning of the war saw large losses on the side of the Dutch, due to their lack of coherent strategy and commitment in fighting Diponegoro's guerrilla warfare. Ambushes were set up, and food supplies were denied to the Dutch troops. \nThe Dutch finally committed themselves to controlling the spreading rebellion by increasing the number of troops and sending General De Kock to stop the insurgency. De Kock developed a strategy of fortified camps (benteng) and mobile forces. Heavily fortified and well-defended soldiers occupied key landmarks to limit the movement of Diponegoro's troops while mobile forces tried to find and fight the rebels. From 1829, Diponegoro definitively lost the initiative and he was put in a defensive position; first in Ungaran, then in the palace of the Resident in Semarang, before finally retreating to Batavia. Many troops and leaders were defeated or deserted.\n\nIn 1830 Diponegoro's military was as good as beaten and negotiations were started. Diponegoro demanded to have a free state under a sultan and wanted to become the Muslim leader (caliph) for the whole of Java. In March 1830 he was invited to negotiate under a flag of truce. He accepted and met at the town of Magelang but was taken prisoner on 28 March despite the flag of truce. De Kock claims that he had warned several Javanese nobles to tell Diponegoro he had to lessen his previous demands or that he would be forced to take other measures.\n\nCircumstances of Diponegoro's arrest were seen differently by himself and the Dutch. The former saw the arrest as a betrayal due to the flag of truce, while the latter declared that he had surrendered. Imagery of the event, by Javanese Raden Saleh and Dutch Nicolaas Pieneman, depicted Diponegoro differently - the former visualizing him as a defiant victim, the latter as a subjugated man. Immediately after his arrest, he was taken to Semarang and later to Batavia, where he was detained at the basement of what is today the Fatahillah Museum. On 1830, he was taken to Manado, Sulawesi by ship.\n\nAfter several years in Manado, he was moved to Makassar in July 1833 where he was kept within Fort Rotterdam due to the Dutch believing that the prison was not strong enough to contain him. Despite his prisoner status, his wife Ratnaningsih and some of his followers accompanied him into exile and he received high-profile visitors including 16 year old Dutch Prince Henry in 1837. Diponegoro also composed manuscripts on Javanese history and wrote his autobiography, \"Babad Diponegoro\", during his exile. His physical health deteriorated due to old age, and he died on 8 January 1855.\n\nBefore he died, Diponegoro mandated that he was to be buried in \"Kampung Melayu\", a neighborhood then inhabited by the Chinese and the Dutch. This was followed, with the Dutch donating 1.5 hectares of land for his graveyard which today has shrunk to just 550 square meters. Later, his wife and followers were also buried in the same complex. His tomb is today visited by pilgrims - often military officers and politicians.\n\nDiponegoro's dynasty would survive to the present day, with their sultans holding secular powers as the governors of Special Region of Yogyakarta. In 1969, a large monument was erected in Tegalrejo, outside Yogyakarta, with sponsorship from the military where Diponegoro's palace was believed to have stood, although at that time there were little to show for such a building.\nIn 1973, under the presidency of Suharto, Diponegoro was made a National Hero of Indonesia.\n\nKodam IV/Diponegoro, Indonesian Army regional command for the Central Java Military Region, is named after him. The Indonesian Navy has named two ships after him. The first of these was the lead ship \"KRI Diponegoro\": a Sigma-class corvette purchased from the Netherlands. Diponegoro University in Semarang was also named after him, along with many major roads in Indonesian cities. Diponegoro is also depicted in Javanese stanzas, \"wayang\" and performing arts, including self-authored \"Babad Diponegoro\".\n\nThe militancy of people's resistance in Java would rise again during the Indonesian Revolution, which saw the country gain independence from the Netherlands. Early Islamist political parties in Indonesia, such as the Masyumi, portrayed Diponegoro's \"jihad\" as a part of the Indonesian national struggle and by extension Islam as a prominent player in the formation of the country.\n\n\n"}

Carlson Endowed Chair of the Women's Studies Program at the University of Rhode Island, a leading international researcher on human trafficking, and also sits on the editorial board of \"Sexualization, Media, and Society\". She is frequently consulted by governments and non-governmental organizations on policy related to women's human rights, particularly on trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation. She has testified before the U.S. House International Relations Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Moscow Duma, and the Czech Parliament.\n\nHughes has written extensively on the prevalence of these issues of exploitation of women within Islamic Fundamentalism.\n\nHughes was raised on a farm in central Pennsylvania. She later attended Pennsylvania State University, earning degrees in animal science before earning a PhD in genetics in 1990.\n\nWhile a student, she started volunteering at a rape crisis center and battered women’s shelter. For several years, she staffed the abuse hotline and co-facilitated support groups for adult survivors of child sexual abuse. During this time, she started to read feminist analyses of violence against women, particularly sexual violence and exploitation. Hughes writes that she began to feel emotional and cognitive dissonance between her scientific studies and the feminist activist work she was doing. Initially an instructor in both genetics and women's studies, an increasingly critical view of what she felt was the disconnected nature of science led her to focus on women's studies.\n\nHughes later served as a lecturer on women's studies at University of Bradford, UK, between 1994 and 1996, before moving on to a full professorship at University of Rhode Island, where she holds the Eleanor M. and Oscar M. Carlson Endowed Chair in Women's Studies. She has also served as Education and Research Coordinator for the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women.\n\nHughes is a co-founder with Melanie Shapiro of Citizens Against Trafficking.\n\nHughes is a leading international researcher on human trafficking. She has completed research on the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation in several countries, including the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and Korea. She does research and writing on women's rights. Her topic areas include: violence, slavery, sexual exploitation, Islamic fundamentalism, and women's organized resistance to violence and exploitation. She has also worked on issues related to women, science and technology.\n\nAdditionally, she was the first to publish research and analysis on the role of the Internet in facilitating sexual exploitation and trafficking of women and girls, and on the mail-order bride industry. She has also written extensively on women's rights in the Islamic world. Hughes has also published several articles on the role of women in science and technology.\n\nHer research has been supported by the U.S. State Department, the National Institute of Justice, the National Science Foundation, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, the International Organization for Migration, the Council of Europe, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, University of Rhode Island Foundation, the University of Rhode Island Council for Research, and the University of Bradford, UK.\n\nShe is one of the leading advocates of the “prohibitionist” view of sexual labour. She is seen by many as a key figure linking the feminist and social conservative movements against sex work, which these movements refer to as \"sex trafficking.\" Hughes has received criticism from sex workers' rights activists for her view that laws against sexual exploitation are necessary to combat human trafficking and sexual slavery, and what many see as personal attacks against other academics and activists who support decriminalization of prostitution.\n\nHughes suggested that government funded HIV prevention programs should check that sex workers were not victims of abuse, rather than simply hand out condoms. In 2002 she went before the House Committee on International Relations to report several harm-reduction programs that had received US funding, carried out by NGOs such as Médecins Sans Frontières, EMPOWER Thailand, International Human Rights Law Group, and the Dutch anti-trafficking organization La Strada. On April 9, 2003, she spoke before the Senate subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs \"There are billions of dollars being spent on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, and a significant portion is directed for prevention in high risk groups such as women and children in prostitution. There should be appropriate restrictions or requirements on how aid organizations and/or personnel respond when they suspect that anyone they come in contact with is abused, exploited, or enslaved.\" Due to her conflation of all forms of prostitution with sex slavery, the changes she helped to bring about applied even to harm reduction programs that worked with under-served women in prostitution.\n\nHughes, in her efforts against sex trafficking and prostitution, has received support from Princeton scholar Robert P. George.\n\nFrom 2006-2009, Hughes was a leading figure in the campaign to end the decriminalized status of indoor prostitution in Rhode Island, so that police could conduct anti-sex trafficking investigations. She is a founding member of the Rhode Island group, Citizens Against Trafficking (CAT) in 2009. The initial legislative battles over indoor prostitution are documented in the 2009 documentary film \"Happy Endings?\", in which Hughes appears, speaking at a community forum on human trafficking and testifying before the state legislature to change the prostitution law.\n\nIn September 2009, Hughes wrote several opinion pieces in the \"Providence Journal\" supporting a version of the legislation with stronger penalties for prostitution and taking the Rhode Island State Senate to task for what she viewed as its de facto support for continuing decriminalization of prostitution. This version of the bill was signed into law in November 2009. Several Rhode Island State Senators wrote editorials disputing Hughes claim that they had kept indoor prostitution legal, with Senator Charles Levesque taking Hughes to task for, in his view, providing a highly distorted reading of the legislation passed by the RI Senate.\n\nSoon after the Rhode Island prostitution law hearings, Hughes was involved in a controversy surrounding the opening of the Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health (CSPH), a sexual education center in Pawtucket, Rhode Island organized by Megan Andelloux, a sex educator who had testified before the Rhode Island Senate in opposition to criminalizing indoor prostitution. Supporters of Andelloux claim that in September 2009, the opening of the CSPH was blocked after an email was sent by Hughes to Pawtucket city council members (stating, \"Hello, A center for 'sexual rights' and 'sexual pleasure' is opening in Pawtucket\"), also citing remarks made about Andelloux in an earlier \"Providence Journal\" editorial by Hughes, as well as in a bulletin on the Citizens Against Trafficking website. A 6-month zoning battle followed with the city of Pawtucket; the CSPH was eventually allowed to open in early 2010.\n\nA March 2010 editorial in the \"Providence Journal\" stated that Hughes and Citizens Against Trafficking co-founder Melanie Shapiro have faced threatening remarks on various internet forums from patrons of massage parlors in retaliation for their role in banning indoor prostitution in Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n"}

There can be several given names, some of these being often referred to as a second name, or middle name(s).\n\nMost given names used in England do not have English etymology. Most traditional names are Latin or Romance, Christian or Biblical names/Hebrew (Daniel, David, John, Michael), Greek (Nicholas, Peter, Paul) or Germanic names adopted via the transmission of Old French/Norman, such as Robert, Richard, Henry or William.\nThere remains a limited set of given names which have an actual English etymology (see Anglo-Saxon names); examples include Alfred, Edgar, Edmund, Edwin, Harold and Oswald. A distinctive feature of Anglophone names is the surnames of important families used as given names, originally to indicate political support or patronage. Many examples have now become normal names chosen because parents like them, and any political sense lost. Most are male names like Cecil, Gerald, Howard, Percy, Montague, Stanley or Gordon, though some have female versions like Cecilia or Geraldine. Other languages have few equivalents, although the saint's surname Xavier is often used by Roman Catholics.\n\nDuring most of the 19th century, the most popular given names were Mary and either John or William for girls and boys, respectively. Throughout the Early Modern period, the variation of given names was comparatively small; the three most frequent male given names accounted for close to 50% of male population throughout this period. For example, of the boys born in London in the year 1510, 24.4% were named John, 13.3% were named Thomas and 11.7% were named William. A trend towards more diversity in given names began in the mid-19th century, and by 1900, 22.9% of the newborn boys, and 16.2% of the newborn girls in the UK shared the top three given names. The trend continued during the 20th century, and by 1994, these figures had fallen to 11% and 8.6%, respectively. This trend is a result of a combination of greater individualism in the choice of names, and the increasing ethnic heterogeneity of UK population, which led to a wider range of frequent given names from non-European traditions.\n\nEnglish surnames appeared in about the 11th century. The introduction of parish registers in 1538 contributed significantly to the stabilization of the surname system, but it was not until the late 17th century that fixed surnames were introduced throughout England.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics., the top ten most frequent surnames in England during the 1990s were:\n\nDouble-barrelled names may be formed for a variety of reasons, including combining of spouses' surnames upon marriage or, more commonly in the past, adding another family's surname as a condition of inheritance.\n\nCompound surnames in English feature two words, often joined by a hyphen or hyphens, for example Henry Hepburne-Scott, with some families having as many as three or four words making up their surname, such as Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton and Alexander Charles Robert Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 9th Marquess of Londonderry. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative Party, whose surname is \"Duncan Smith\".\n\n\n"}

He called himself Müller-Thurgau, taking the name of his home canton.\n\nHermann Müller was born to Konrad Müller, a master baker and vintner, and his wife Maria Egloff, the daughter of Karl Anton Egloff, a wine merchant of Oestrich, Hessen. He attended the Lehrerseminar Kreuzlingen (Kreuzlingen Teachers College) (1869-70). He taught in Stein am Rhein (1870-72) while studying at the Polytechnikum Zürich (1872 graduate). He then attended the University of Würzburg for graduate studies under Julius von Sachs, was awarded his PdD in 1874 and stayed some time as Sachs' assistant. During the years 1876−1890 he worked at the Prussian Institute for Horticulture and Viticulture (\"Königlich Preussische Lehranstalt für Obst- und Weinbau\") in Geisenheim, Rheingau where he led its experimental station for plant physiology. \n\nIn 1891 he returned to Switzerland as director of the newly created Experimental Station and School for Horticulture and Viticulture (\"Versuchsstation und Schule für Obst-, Wein- und Gartenbau\") in Wädenswil, where he stayed until his 1924 retirement. From 1902, he was also connected to Polytechnikum Zürich as professor of botany.\n\nHe worked on teams which investigated fertility of the vine, vine diseases, and malolactic fermentation in wine.\n\nIn 1890, he was made an honorary member of the German Viticultural Association and in 1920 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bern.\n\nMüller researched and published on a wide range of topics in viticulture and winemaking, including the biology of vine flowering, assimilation of nutrients by the vine, vine diseases, alcoholic fermentation of wine, breeding of strains of yeast with specific properties, malolactic fermentation, development of wine faults, and methods for producing alcohol-free grape juice. \n\nDuring his time in Geisenheim, Müller created the grape variety Müller-Thurgau in a breeding programme initiated in 1882, by crossing Riesling with Madeleine Royale, although for a long time it was erroneously assumed to be Riesling x Silvaner. Müller's goal was to combine the aromatic properties of Riesling with the earlier and more reliable ripening of Silvaner. Experimental plantations continued in Geisenheim until 1890, and in 1891 150 plants were shipped to Wädenswil where trials continued under Heinrich Schellenberg (1868−1967). The most successful clone of the trials (serial no. 58) was propagated in 1897 under the designation Riesling x Silvaner 1. Vines of this variety were distributed in Switzerland and abroad from 1908, and in 1913, 100 vines of this variety were taken to Germany by August Dern (1858−1930), who had worked with Müller in Geisenheim. Dern introduced the name \"Müller-Thurgau\" for the variety, while Müller himself continued to call it Riesling x Silvaner 1, although he did express doubts that this was the actual parentage of the new variety, and speculated that some misidentification of vine material could have occurred in the move from Geisenheim to Wädenswil.\n\nMany experimental plantations of Müller-Thurgau in Germany were conducted from 1920, and its breakthrough from 1938 is credited to the grape breeder Georg Scheu in Alzey. By the 1950s it had become the most cultivated of any newly created grape varieties. It was the most planted grape variety of Germany from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s, and is still the second-most planted.\n"}

He among the leading dignitaries of Aleppo and during the Hananu Revolt against the French occupation of northern Syria, he was one of principal intermediaries between the Syrian rebels and the Turkish forces of Mustafa Kemal.\n\nJamil Ibrahim Pasha was a Sunni Muslim and was described as an \"Arabized Kurd\" by historian Philip Khoury. A native of Aleppo, he enrolled in the Ottoman Military College in Istanbul and joined the reformist Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which took power in the Ottoman state in 1908 during the Young Turk Revolution. Ibrahim Pasha served in the Ottoman army during the Balkan Wars, a series of conflicts between the Ottomans and nationalist forces in their empire's Balkan territories between 1912 and 1913. During World War I and the 1916 Arab Revolt against the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha advocated for preserving the unity of the Ottoman Empire. However, following the Ottomans' fall, he became allied with the Arab nationalist forces in Syria.\n\nFrance gained full control of Syria in 1920 after defeated the Arab government of King Faisal I in July 1920. During this time, guerrilla groups and political activists and dignitaries opposed to French rule launched a revolt against the French, known as the Hananu Revolt after its main political leader, Ibrahim Hananu. Faisal's Arab government had been the main financial backer of the revolt, but after its fall, Hananu and the rebels turned to Turkish guerrillas also fighting the French in southwestern Anatolia, which borders the Aleppo region. Jamil Ibrahim Pasha became a main liaison between the Syrian rebels and the Turkish guerrillas, who were led by Mustafa Kemal. Jamil Ibrahim Pasha met with Mustafa Kemal in the late summer of 1920 to finalize plans for a Turkish-Syrian military campaign against French forces. The Hananu revolt dissipated by the summer of 1921.\n\nFollowing the revolt's collapse, Ibrahim Pasha maintained strong links to Aleppo's population. Of all of Aleppo's political leaders, Ibrahim Pasha had the closest ties to the inhabitants of Aleppo's nationalist-dominated quarters. At his advice, high school students throughout the city posted themselves at voting booths to encourage would-be voters to boycott the parliamentary elections of 1925, which coincided with the outbreak of the Great Syrian Revolt (1925–1927) against the French. The effort was a major success, with 23% of registered voters participating in the polls versus 40% in the 1923 elections. Ibrahim Pasha and 42 other Aleppine boycott leaders were subsequently arrested by the French authorities. In 1928, Ibrahim Pasha and many of the other pro-revolt leadership of Syria were amnestied by the French and in March Ibrahim Pasha joined the National Bloc. The latter was a political opposition movement that called for Syria's independence. Ibrahim Pasha became one of the leaders of the movement from Aleppo, and was a member of the National Bloc Council, the movement's 38-member executive body.\n"}

From 1979 to 2000, he was the Bishop of Newark, New Jersey. A liberal Christian theologian, religion commentator and author, he calls for a fundamental rethinking of Christian belief away from theism and traditional doctrines.\n\nSpong was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and educated in public schools there. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1952. He received his Master of Divinity degree from the Virginia Theological Seminary in 1955. He has had honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees conferred on him by Virginia Theological Seminary and Saint Paul's College, Virginia, as well as an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters conferred by Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2005, he wrote: \"[I have] immerse[d] myself in contemporary Biblical scholarship at such places as Union Theological Seminary in New York City, Yale Divinity School, Harvard Divinity School and the storied universities in Edinburgh, Oxford and Cambridge.\"\n\nSpong served as rector of St. Joseph's Church in Durham, North Carolina, from 1955 to 1957; rector of Calvary Parish, Tarboro, North Carolina, from 1957 to 1965; rector of St. John's Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, from 1965 to 1969; and rector of St. Paul's Church in Richmond, Virginia, from 1969 to 1976. He has held visiting positions and given lectures at major American theological institutions, most prominently at Harvard Divinity School. He retired in 2000. As a retired bishop, he is a member of the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops.\n\nSpong describes his own life as a journey from the literalism and conservative theology of his childhood to an expansive view of Christianity. In a 2013 interview, Spong credits the late Anglican bishop John Robinson as his mentor in this journey and says that reading Robinson's controversial writings in the 1960s led to a friendship and mentoring relationship with him over many years. Spong also honors Robinson as a mentor in the opening pages of his 2002 book \"A New Christianity for a New World\".\n\nRecipient of many awards, including 1999 Humanist of the Year, Spong is a contributor to the Living the Questions DVD program and has been a guest on numerous national television broadcasts (including \"The Today Show\", \"Politically Incorrect\" with Bill Maher, \"Dateline\", \"60 Minutes\", and \"Larry King Live\"). Spong's calendar has him lecturing around the world.\n\nSpong is the cousin of former Virginia Democratic Senator William B. Spong, Jr., who defeated the incumbent Absalom Willis Robertson, the father of television evangelist Pat Robertson.\n\nBy his own account, he is closely associated with the Unity Church.\n\nAccording to The Episcopal Diocese of Newark, Bishop Spong suffered a stroke before a speaking engagement in Marquette, Michigan on Saturday, Sept 10, 2016.\n\nSpong's writings rely on Biblical and non-Biblical sources and are influenced by modern critical analysis of these sources (see especially Spong, 1991). He is representative of a stream of thought with roots in the medieval universalism of Peter Abelard and the existentialism of Paul Tillich, whom he has called his favorite theologian.\n\nA prominent theme in Spong's writing is that the popular and literal interpretations of Christian scripture are not sustainable and do not speak honestly to the situation of modern Christian communities. He believes in a more nuanced approach to scripture, informed by scholarship and compassion, which can be consistent with both Christian tradition and contemporary understandings of the universe. He believes that theism has lost credibility as a valid conception of God's nature. He states that he is a Christian because he believes that Jesus Christ fully expressed the presence of a God of compassion and selfless love and that this is the meaning of the early Christian proclamation, \"Jesus is Lord\" (Spong, 1994 and Spong, 1991). Elaborating on this last idea he affirms that Jesus was adopted by God as his son, (\"Born of a Woman\" 1992), and he says that this would be the way God was fully incarnated in Jesus Christ. He rejects the historical truth claims of some Christian doctrines, such as the Virgin Birth (Spong, 1992) and the bodily resurrection of Jesus (Spong, 1994). In 2000, Spong was a critic of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Roman Catholic Church's declaration \"Dominus Iesus\", because it reaffirmed the Catholic doctrine that the Roman Catholic Church is the one true Church and, perhaps even more importantly, that Jesus Christ is the one and only savior for humanity.\n\nSpong has also been a strong proponent of the church reflecting the changes in society at large. Towards these ends, he calls for a new Reformation, in which many of Christianity's basic doctrines should be reformulated.\n\nHis views on the future of Christianity are, \"...that we have to start where we are. As I look at the history of religion, I observe that new religious insights always and only emerge out of the old traditions as they begin to die. It is not by pitching the old insights out but by journeying deeply through them into new visions that we are able to change religion’s direction. The creeds were 3rd and 4th century love songs that people composed to sing to their understanding of God. We do not have to literalize their words to perceive their meaning or their intention to join in the singing of their creedal song. I think religion in general and Christianity in particular must always be evolving. Forcing the evolution is the dialogue between yesterday’s words and today’s knowledge. The sin of Christianity is that any of us ever claimed that we had somehow captured eternal truth in the forms we had created.\"\n\nSpong has debated Christian philosopher and apologist William Lane Craig on the resurrection of Jesus.\n\nIn 1991's \"Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism: A Bishop Rethinks the Meaning of Scripture\", Spong argues that St. Paul was homosexual, a theme satirised in Gore Vidal's novel \"\".\n\nSpong's \"Twelve Points for Reform\" were originally published in \"The Voice\", the newsletter of the Diocese of Newark, in 1998. Spong elaborates on them in his book \"A New Christianity for a New World\":\n\nSpong acknowledges that his writings evoke great support and great condemnation simultaneously from differing segments of the Christian church.\n\nSpong's ideas have been criticized by some other theologians, notably in 1998 by Rowan Williams, the Bishop of Monmouth, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury. Williams described Spong's Twelve Points for Reform as embodying \"confusion and misinterpretation\".\n\nDuring a speaking tour in Australia in 2001, Spong was banned by Peter Hollingworth, the Archbishop of Brisbane, from speaking at churches in the diocese. The tour coincided with Hollingworth leaving the diocese to become the Governor-General of Australia. Hollingworth said that it was not an appropriate moment for Spong to \"engage congregations in matters that could prove theologically controversial\". After Spong's book \"Jesus for the Non-Religious\" was published in 2007, Peter Jensen, the Archbishop of Sydney, banned Spong from preaching at any churches in his diocese. By contrast, Phillip Aspinall, the Primate of Australia, invited Spong in 2007 to deliver two sermons at St. John's Cathedral, Brisbane.\n\nMark Tooley, a Methodist who is president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a think tank noted for its critique of liberal religious groups, criticized Spong in 2010 as \"brandishing the stale theologies and ideologies of a half-century ago\".\n\nMichael Bott, former vice-president of the Wellington Christian Apologetics Society in New Zealand, and Jonathan Sarfati, editorial consultant for Creation Ministries International, criticized Spong's scholarship in an article published by the Apologetics Society's journal in 1995 and updated in 2007, saying he \"views the world through the eyes of 19th century rationalism.\"\n\nAlbert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, has condemned Spong as a heretic, claiming that he has \"denied virtually every major Christian doctrine\".\n\n\n"}

Although its official purpose was to give women a chance to serve the Empire of Japan prior to marriage, it was a means to compel women to perform labor duties.\n\nThe original meaning of the term \"Volunteer Corps\" is \"take the initiative to organize for the country.\" The term were used for the war support groups in many areas. A labor shortage continued in the war, and the \"Volunteer Corps\" organization was started, followed by the \"Women's Volunteer Corps\" organization consisting of female labors.\n\nIt is not clear when the Women's Volunteer Labour Corps started in Korea. Women's shipbuilding began with no legal basis. In August 23, 1944, the legal basis was carried out and the troops were officially launched. The Act was also applied to colonial Korea and Taiwan.\n\nKorean women without spouses aged from 12 to 40 belonged to the Troops, and they were arranged to the munitions factories. There were many mobilization methods including agency of government offices, public recruitment, voluntary support and propaganda through schools and organizations. 200,000 Japanese and Korean women were mobilized as workers, including 50,000-70,000 Korean people.\n\nIn the spring of 1944, in South Chungcheong Province and South Jeolla Province, girls aged from 12 to 14 were recruited with invitation of school and job, forced to work in the military aircraft factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries with no payment. Some of them were introduced by Japanese teachers. The number of girls who worked in the factory is estimated at 400.\n\nIt is testified that girls recruited from North Gyeongsang Province elsewhere were forced to work in logistics company, Fujikoshi Steel Industrial Co., Ltd. Toyama plant. They also did not receive proper wages. In 1943, Kim Kum-jin, who was a student of the (), heard the school president () deploring that \"[t]here are no students who support a labor volunteer corps.

The term \"Volunteer Corps\" was often used interchangeably with the term \"comfort women\" after the war. Because of this misunderstanding, some women who finished forced labor could not explain the fact that they worked as forced labor, because they were afraid to be confused with comfort women.\n\n"}

Delgado claimed to have carried out 48 murders in Spain, Italy and France – of these cases the Spanish police were only able to investigate twenty-two in Spain and considered him the definite perpetrator of seven. He was never brought to trial, as he was diagnosed with a severe mental disorder, and in 1978 the \"Audiencia Nacional\" ordered that he be preventively detained at Carabanchel Penitentiary Psychiatric Hospital. He was released into the care of a psychiatric hospital in 1996 and died two years later of a smoking-related lung disease.\n\nManuel Delgado Villegas was born in Seville, Spain on January 25, 1943, the son of José Delgado Martín. His mother died while giving birth to him, at the age of 24. The itinerant nature of his father's job as a salesman of arrope (a fruit concentrate produced in southern Spain and used to make sweets), hence the nickname \"El Arropiero\", resulted in Delgado and his sister Joaquina being sent to live with their maternal grandmother in Mataró. The two children lived with their grandmother in the predominantly Andalusian neighbourhood of La Cirera. He attended school but never learned to read and write. Delgado was bisexual and prostituted himself from early adolescence.\n\nIn 1961, aged 18, Delgado enlisted in the Spanish Legion. There he learnt hand-to-hand combat techniques, and one in particular, the \"golpe legionario\" or \"golpe mortal\" (literally \"deadly blow\"), a blow to the larynx with the edge of the hand that became one of his preferred methods of killing.\n\nAfter the army, Delgado left Mataró and became a nomad, wandering along the Mediterranean coast begging, stealing and picking fights with prostitutes and homosexuals. He was arrested several times under the \"Ley de Vagos y Maleantes\" or \"Ley de Peligrosidad Social\" (lit. \"Law of Slackers and Crooks\" and \"Law of Dangerousness to Society\") that targeted beggars and homosexuals during the Francoist dictatorship, but was never imprisoned. His odd behavior under arrest always led to him being sent to mental institutions, from which he was soon released.\n\nDelgado killed his first confirmed victim in 1964, aged 21, and remained active until his arrest at 28 in 1971. He never killed with premeditation. Sometimes a simple trivial comment by the victim would be taken as an insult and unleash Delgado's rage, who would kill them with great violence using a blunt object, strangling them or with his bare hands; Delgado would attack others with the intention of robbing them or, if the victim was female, raping them, which he did only after they were dead. The wildly different nature of the crimes and the victims (men and women, young and old, Spanish and foreign, heterosexual and homosexual, rich and poor) and Delgado's nomadic lifestyle made it impossible for law enforcement to connect the killings as the work of a single person before Delgado's confession. Only the last two murders happened in the same place and close in time, precipitating Delgado's arrest.\n\n\n\nDelgado's confirmed crimes are often misreported as eight instead of seven. This probably stems from a 1977 article in the popular weekly newspaper \"El Caso\", that proposed Delgado as the possible murderer of Natividad Romero Rodríguez, a prostitute found dead in a large clay jar in a country house near Barajas, Madrid in 1969. She had been raped and strangled with great violence by a man using only one hand three days before, leading the investigators to suspect someone with military background, possibly an American pilot from the nearby Torrejón Air Base since the victim had often been seen in such company. The crime, however, remains unsolved and was never linked to Delgado by the police. Another victim often cited is Almudena Sánchez Rus, murdered in El Puerto de Santa María in 1972, but at that time Delgado was already arrested and in custody.\n\nOn the other hand, Delgado himself claimed to have killed also a foreign woman in Sant Feliu de Guixols, stabbed another woman in Alicante, strangled a homosexual man with a wire in Barcelona and even to have thrown another homosexual, a client, off a cliff in Garraf after the victim said \"Such beauty! Such a view! I wouldn't mind dying right in this place!\", to which Delgado replied \"Die then\" and pushed him. On another occasion, Delgado displayed discomfort upon hearing over the police car radio that 80 bodies had been found buried in a man's garden in Mexico; he immediately asked the police to be freed for 24 hours, promising not to escape, \"so this guy doesn't beat me.\"\n\nFollowing the disappearance of Antonia \"Toñi\" Rodríguez Relinque, a 38-year-old intellectually disabled woman who had been seen on various occasions in the company of Delgado, the police accompanied Delgado to El Puerto de Santa María police station where he was questioned by Cadiz's \"Brigada de Investigación Criminal\" (Criminal Investigation Division) over the disappearance of the person whom they now knew to be his girlfriend. He initially denied killing her, but following the discovery of her body in a secluded spot known as \"Pago Galvecito\", on the outskirts of El Puerto de Santa María, on February 21, 1971, he confessed to her murder – Delgado confessed that he had strangled the woman with her own tights while they were having sex. The local newspaper, the \"Diario de Cádiz\", dubbed him \"El estrangulador del Puerto\" (The Puerto strangler), though this nickname was dropped later at the request of El Puerto's local authorities, who feared the town's name would be tainted. Over the next few days he admitted his guilt in the murders of four others and was considered the definite perpetrator of seven murders in total (including two that had been originally considered accidents) before the investigation was halted and Delgado put in a mental institution without trial or a proper conviction. While under interrogation, Delgado remained calm and shared many details of the crimes with the police.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, it was widely reported that he was diagnosed as having XYY syndrome which led to claims that this may have been responsible for his violent behaviour. However, the link between XYY syndrome and violent behaviour has been disproven by modern studies of the condition.\n\nIn the process of investigating the veracity of his claims the investigating magistrate of El Puerto de Santa María, Conrado Gallardo Ros, along with detectives involved in the cases, accompanied Delgado to the scenes of the crimes over a period of two years where he re-enacted and explained the crimes. One detective in particular, Salvador Ortega, succeed in gaining Delgado's trust and was the one who was given the most information. Photos taken during the investigation show Delgado smiling and even embracing the detectives, who used the affectionate form of his name – \"Manolo\" or even \"Manolito\". On a side note, Delgado became the first serial killer to travel the scenes of his crimes by airplane.\n\nManuel Delgado Villegas died on February 2, 1998 at the \"Hospital Can Ruti\" in Badalona as a result of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n\na The nickname was first attributed to his father, a travelling salesman of arrope; Delgado Villegas was in turn known as \"The \"Son\" of \"El Arropiero\"\" before it was contracted into \"El Arropiero\". If Delgado Villegas ever sold arrope himself it was between September 1970 and his arrest in January 1971 only, a time when he had returned to El Puerto de Santa María to live with his father.\n"}

He briefly studied engineering in Zürich, before enlisting as an artillery cadet and becoming a Second Lieutenant in 1916 (during World War I). Between 1919 and 1921, he lived in Switzerland for a second time, receiving his diploma in engineering.\n\nIn December 1921, Pauker was designated a member of the Provisional Committee of the Romanian Communist Party; in 1922, his position became that of member of the Central Committee and the Politburo, being sent as delegate to the Balkan Communist Federation Conferences in Sofia (June 1922) and Berlin (1923). His activities brought him to the attention of the Romanian authorities: he was arrested and sentenced first to ten years imprisonment, and then to labour for life. Nevertheless, he managed to escape and flee to the Soviet Union in 1925, returning to Romania in 1929. On his arrival he was escorted back to prison, only to be released under the terms of an amnesty. He was yet again arrested in Petroşani, after his activities as an instigator during the Jiu Valley miners' strike of August 1929.\n\nMarcel Pauker got involved in a political fight with Vitali Holostenco, reflecting the struggle between the Bucharest section and that of the Ukrainian SSR that had taken hold of the Party's wing inside the Soviet Union around the proceedings of the 4th Congress in Kharkiv. Again in the Soviet Union, Pauker was reprimanded by the Comintern. Forbidden from contributing to political activities, he was sent to assist as an engineer in the industrial expansion of Magnitogorsk (in western Siberia), a job he undertook between 1930 and 1932. At the same time, Joseph Stalin, whose priority at the time was showing the facade of \"unity\" within his subject Parties, had Holostenco removed from his position.\n\nIn 1935 Pauker was appointed a member of the Secretariat of the Romanian Communist Party. He spent time in Prague until 1937, when he returned to the Soviet Union. He fell victim to the Great Purge: arrested by the NKVD on March 21, 1937 and held in the infamous Taganka Prison, Marcel Pauker was first interrogated over a year later, being presented with the charge of espionage in favor of Romania. Records show that he finally admitted to the charge (most likely after being subjected to torture). Consequently, he was put on trial, sentenced to death and executed by shooting.\n\nMarcel Pauker was rehabilitated by Soviet authorities in 1957 (as part of the De-Stalinization process under Nikita Khrushchev). Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's rejection of newer Soviet policies prevented this and other such cases from being mirrored in Communist Romania. While Gheorghiu-Dej was exercising a looser control of the society, he was not ready to question most of the Stalinist measures, as these had served to enforce his own rule during the previous decade.\n\nThe case was reconsidered under Nicolae Ceauşescu's further distancing measures. Pauker's name was cleared, but mention of his activities and details of his life were kept secret.\n\nLargely thanks to circumstances, Ana Pauker was able to survive her husband's downfall, and she even reached the peak of her political career in the following years.\n\nThey had three children together:\n\nVlad moved to France.\n\nIn 1931 Marcel also fathered a son named Yakov, from his relationship with fellow militant Roza Elbert.\n\nHe also had lengthy affairs with Elena Filipovici and Vanda Nicolschi.\n\n"}

{"id": "2727254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2727254", "title": "Mnemonist", "text": "Mnemonist\n\nThe title mnemonist (derived from the term mnemonic) refers to an individual with the ability to remember and recall unusually long lists of data, such as unfamiliar names, lists of numbers, entries in books, etc. The duration of superior retention can be minutes, hours, days, or decades. Mnemonists may have superior innate ability to recall or remember, or may use techniques such as the method of loci.\n\nWhile the innateness of mnemonists' skills is debated, the methods that mnemonists use to memorize are well-documented. Many mnemonists have been studied in psychology labs over the last century, and most have been found to use mnemonic devices. Currently, all memory champions at the World Memory Championships have said that they use mnemonic strategies, such as the method of loci, to perform their memory feats.\n\nSkilled memory theory was proposed by K. Anders Ericsson and Bill Chase to explain the effectiveness of mnemonic devices in memory expertise. Generally, short-term memory has a capacity of seven items; however, in order to memorize long strings of unrelated information, this constraint must be overcome. Skilled memory theory involves three steps: meaningful encoding, retrieval structure, and speed-up.\n\nIn encoding, information is encoded in terms of knowledge structures through meaningful associations. This may initially involve breaking down long lists into more manageable chunks that fall within the capacity of short term memory. Verbal reports of memory experts show a consistent grouping of three or four. A digit sequence 1-9-4-5, for example, can then be remembered as \"the year World War Two ended\". Luria reported that Solomon Shereshevsky used synesthesia to associate numbers and words as visual images or colors to encode the information presented to him, but Luria did not clearly distinguish between synesthesia and mnemonic techniques like the method of loci and number shapes. Other subjects studied have used previous knowledge such as racing times or historical information to encode new information. This is supported by studies that have shown that previous knowledge about a subject will increase one's ability to remember it. Chess experts, for example, can memorize more pieces of a chess game in progress than a novice chess player. However, while there is some correlation between memory expertise and general intelligence, as measured by either IQ or the general intelligence factor, the two are by no means identical. Many memory experts have been shown to be average to above-average by these two measures, but not exceptional.\n\nThe next step is to create a retrieval structure by which the associations can be recalled. It serves the function of storing retrieval cues without having to use short term memory. It is used to preserve the order of items to be remembered. Verbal reports of memory experts show two prominent methods of retrieving information: hierarchical nodes and the method of loci. Retrieval structures are hierarchically organized and can be thought of as nodes that are activated when information is retrieved. Verbal reports have shown that memory experts have different retrieval structures. One expert clustered digits into groups, groups into supergroups, and supergroups into clusters of supergroups. However, by far the most common method of retrieval structure is the method of loci.\n\nThe method of loci is \"the use of an orderly arrangement of locations into which one could place the images of things or people that are to be remembered\". The encoding process happens in three steps. First, an architectural area, such as the houses on a street, must be memorized. Second, each item to be remembered must be associated with a separate image. Finally, this set of images can be distributed in a \"locus,\" or place within the architectural area in a pre-determined order. Then, as one tries to recall the information, the mnemonists simply has to \"walk\" down the street, see each symbol, and recall the associated information. An example of mnemonists who used this is Solomon Shereshevsky; he would use Gorky Street, a street he lived on. When he read, each word would form a graphic image. He would then place this image in a place along the street; later, when he needed to recall the information, he would simply \"stroll\" down the street again to recall the necessary information.\nNeuroimaging studies have shown results that support the method of loci as the retrieval method in world-class memory performers. An fMRI recorded brain activity in memory experts and a control group as they were memorizing selected data. Previous studies have shown that teaching a control group the method of loci leads to changes in brain activation during memorization. Consistent with their use of the method of loci, memory experts had higher activity in the medial parietal cortex, retrospenial cortex, and right posterior hippocampus; these brain areas have been linked to spatial memory and navigation. These differences were observable even when the memory experts were trying to memorize stimuli, such as snowflakes, where they showed no superior ability to the control group.\n\nThe final step in skilled memory theory is acceleration. With practice, time necessary for encoding and retrieval operations can be dramatically reduced. As a result, storage of information can then be performed within a few seconds. Indeed, one confounding factor in the study of memory is that the subjects often improve from day-to-day as they are tested over and over.\n\nThe innateness of expert performance in the memory field has been studied thoroughly by many scientists; it is a matter which has still not been definitively resolved.\n\nMuch evidence exists which points towards memory expertise as a learned skill which can only be learned through hours of deliberate practice. Anecdotally, the performers in top memory competitions like the World Memory Championships and the Extreme Memory Tournament all deny any ability of a photographic memory; rather, these experts have averaged 10 years practicing their encoding strategies. Another piece of evidence which points away from an innate superiority of memory is the specificity of memory expertise in memorists. For example, though memory experts have an exceptional ability to remember digits, their ability to remember unrelated items which are more difficult to encode, such as symbols or snowflakes, is the same as that of an average person. The same holds true for memory experts in other fields: studies of mental calculators and chess experts show the same specificity for superior memory. In some cases, other types of memory, such as visual memory for faces, may even be impaired. \nAnother piece of evidence of memory expertise as a learned ability is the fact that dedicated individuals can make exceptional memory gains when exposed to mnemonics and given a chance to practice. One subject, SF, a college student of average intelligence, was able to attain world-class memory performance after hundreds of hours of practice over two years. His memory, in fact, improved over 70 standard deviations, while his digit span, or memory span for digits, grew to 80 digits, which was higher than the digit span for all memory experts previously recorded. Similarly, adults of average intelligence taught encoding strategies also show large gains in memory performance. Finally, neuroimaging studies performed on memory experts and compared to a control group have found no systematic anatomical differences in the brain between memory experts and a control group. While it is true that there are activation differences between the brains of memory experts and a control group, these are due to the use of spatial techniques to form retrieval structures, not any structural differences.\n\nMuch of the evidence for innate superiority of memory is anecdotal and is therefore rejected by scientists who have moved toward accepting only reproducible studies as evidence for elite performance. There have been exceptions, however, that do not fit skilled memory theory as proposed by Chase and Ericsson. Synesthetes, for example, show a memory advantage for material that induces their synesthesia over a control group. This advantage tends to be in retention of new information rather than learning. However, synesthetes are likely to have some brain differences which give them an innate advantage when it comes to memory. Another group which may have some innate memory advantage are autistic savants. Unfortunately, many savants who have performed memory feats, such as Kim Peek and Daniel Tammet, have not been studied in a lab; they do claim to not need to use encoding strategies. A recent imaging study of savants found that there are activation differences between savants and typically developing individuals; these cannot be explained by the method of loci as mnemonic savants do not tend to use encoding strategies for their memory. Savants activated the right inferior occipital areas of their brain, whereas control participants activated the left parietal region which is generally associated with attentional processes.\n\n\nMemory sport contains a more comprehensive list of well-known memory athletes.

She was a member of the Circassian princely family of House of Temyryko () of princedom of Kabardia of Circassia. Her father was Prince Temyryko Mansur and her mother belonged to the Principality of Dadeshkeliani. She had two elder siblings, a brother Prince Andok Bey (1818 – 1886) and a sister, Princess Fatma Şemsfer Hanım (1821 – 1855), and a younger brother Prince Süleyman Bey (16 March 1825 – 1896).\n\nIn 1838 Servetseza left her city of birth and reached Istanbul. She became a lady-in-waiting to Sultan Abdul Hamid I's daughter, Mahmud's half sister, Esma Sultan.\n\nWhen Abulmejid ascended the throne, after the death of his father on 2 July 1839, Esma Sultan selected Servetseza as a wife for her nephew, the new Sultan. Servetseza married him in 1839 and, was given the title of \"Baş Kadın\". Her marriage to Abdulmejid strengthened the relations between the two dynasties. Arter her marriage, he made her sister, Fatma Şemsfer Hanım, hazinedar of the Imperial Harem. \n\nThe harem had felt the utmost of jealousy towards Servetseza and had written ditties against her, pointing to her shrewish nature. She was an intelligent and a well cultured lady, and was described an interesting and accomplished woman, but not extraordinary for extra charms. \n\nServetseza remained childless. After Gülcemal Kadın's death in 1851, Fatma Sultan, Refia Sultan and Şehzade Mehmed Reşad (future Mehmed V) were enrusted in her care. \n\nWhen Bezmiâlem Sultan died in 1853, Servetseza was placed incharge of Abdulmejid's harem. Upon this occasion, Şevkefza Kadın took courage of Servetseza Kadın's affection for heir Şehzade Mehmed Murad (future Sultan Murad V) and Abdulmejid's wish to see his son as the next Sultan, and rose in opposition to Pertevniyal Sultan and her son Şehzade Abdülaziz (the future Sultan Abdülaziz).\n\nDürrünev Kadın, first wife of Sultan Abdülaziz, was a lady-in-waiting to her.\n\nAfter Abdulmejid's death on 25 June 1861 she moved to Kabataş Palace. Servetseza was apparently very fond of Murad, and indiscreetly told many people that Abdul Hamid II had usurped the throne from Murad. She died on 25 September 1878, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the imperial ladies at the Yavuz Selim Mosque, Istanbul.\n\nIt is believed by some that Servetseza Kadın, was murdered. One night in Ramadan she is said to have gone to Abdulhamid and warned him. She ordered him to give the throne back to it to its rightful owner. After pretending to heed her warning, he arranged that she be served with a poisoned drink. She died upon her return to her palace.\n\n\n"}

Seeking allies, Leo III the Isaurian sent an embassy to Bihar, \"Khagan\" of the Khazars. The alliance was sealed with the marriage of Tzitzak to Constantine V, son and junior co-ruler of Leo.\n\nTzitzak was escorted to Constantinople for her marriage. Constantine was about fourteen years old, while Tzitzak may have been even younger as she would not give birth for eighteen years. Tzitzak became a Christian under the baptismal name Irene. Tzitzak's wedding gown became famous, starting a new fashion craze in Constantinople for male robes called \"tzitzakia\".\n\nThe chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor records that Tzitzak learned to read religious texts. He describes her as pious and contrasts her with the \"impiety\" of her father-in-law and husband. The emperors Leo III and Constantine V were iconoclasts while Theophanes was an iconodule monk. His praise probably reflected the fact that Irene herself shared his views.\n\nIt is uncertain whether her mother-in-law Maria was still the senior empress at the time of Tzitzak's marriage. Leo III died on 18 June 741. Constantine V succeeded him with Irene as his empress consort. However, civil war broke out almost immediately as Artabasdos, brother-in-law of Constantine, claimed the throne for himself. The civil war lasted until 2 November 743. The role of Irene in the war is not described by Theophanes.\n\nOn 25 January 750, Constantine and Tzitzak had a son, Leo, who would succeed his father as Emperor Leo IV—better known as \"Leo the Khazar\". Leo's birth is the last mention of Irene in the historical record. By the following year, Constantine was already married to his second wife Maria. Lynda Garland has suggested Tzitzak died in childbirth.\n\nThe word \"tzitzak\" is most likely a Hellenized version of the Turkic word \"çiçek\", meaning \"flower.\"\n\n"}
