{"id": "58164345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58164345", "title": "!Kora Wars", "text": "!Kora Wars\n\nThe !Kora Wars was a period of raiding by the !Kora people and subsequent military action by the Boer authorities. The mid-nineteenth century experienced migration as a result of the protracted frontier wars that forced the movement of certain indigenous groups further north of the Cape Colony. These included the Khoisan, the Bastaard (a derogatory terms used to distinguish people of mixed European and Khoi heritage) and the !Kora, a people whom the colonial authorities considered more of a bandit community. The !Kora were known to loot communities living around the lower to middle Orange River. The raids increased in volume and intensity during the mid eighteen hundreds. This forced the authorities to launch a series of expeditions aimed at countering the raids. The !Kora were finally crushed in 1879, but their intimate knowledge of the Gariep (Orange River) rendered them the most significant threat to settler colonies outside of the Bantu nations at the time.\n\nRecent studies has come to consider the !Kora people as more of a loose group of communities. Initially they consisted of two groupings, the Little Korana and the Great Korana. Movement and divisions would come to separate them into even smaller groups. Some of these differences were caused by quarrels over grazing rights, livestock and water sources. The !Ikora were a nomadic people, who were not bound to any one place for long stretches of time, even then they were considered to be semi-pastoral communities. Many of them shunned life in the Cape Colony because it meant living a life of servitude and hard labour. Instead, they looked northwards for a free life. Their ability to use guns and ride horses effectively were skills adopted under colonial life and these were skills that would prove beneficial to their cause. This made them highly adept at raiding livestock belonging to colonial settler communities.\n\nMany groups within the !Kora community lived all along the expansive Orange River. They became highly knowledgeable of it and used its islands and riverbanks to their advantage. During this time the banks of the Orange were dense with foliage and reeds. On the river itself were numerous islands dotted about, which revealed themselves when water levels were low. The combination of tall reeds and the islands provided an advantage for the !Kora, because they were able to ambush their targets much easier.\n\nIn the 1830’s the sparse settler communities along the Orange River region were able to counter some of the raids from the !Kora people, however a highly skilled and organised group of !Kora marauders began to emerge. A former slave known as Stuurman who belonged to a family in Griqualand led this group. Little is recorded on his ancestry. With a growing number of disgruntled! !Kora under his leadership, he gained notoriety 1832 when he and his followers stole livestock on cattle farms south of the Orange River. It is reported that they stole 5 wagons, 3000 sheep, 70 horses and 200 head of cattle. Over the next two years they proceeded to loot the border towns of Clanwilliam, Beaufort West and Graaf Reinet. These were areas leading out of the Cape Colony; policing presence in these areas was scattered. Stuurman also launched attacks on the Tswana of Griqualand. Stuurman was however shot and killed by a white cattle farmer.\n\nThe 1860’s in Southern Africa brought about a serious drought, which had a profound impact on the movement of the Bantu communities; the trekbroers who were beginning to concentrate on a life in the interior; and the Khoi and San communities that were being forced further north by the latter's migration. The communities around the Orange River were beginning to grow in their numbers, a reality that some !Kora leaders took full advantage of. The most notorious leaders of this time were Klaas Springbokke of the Springbokke group, Klaas Lukas of the Cat Korana group, with Cupido Pofadder occupying the more westerly region of the Orange River. These fractured groups put a lot of roving Trekboers and Bastaard communities under pressure, with their cattle being a prime target. Some of !Kora were also rumoured to have secured smuggling networks further in the interior that could supply them with arms. Jan Kivido and Piet Rooi formed a partnership and were the most consistent raiders.\n\nThe first recorded significant incident between the !Kora people and the colonial government occurred in 1869, when a Griqua and Scottish trader were robbed along the southern bank of the Orange River. Piet Rooi, the leader of another nomadic !Kora group, was held responsible for the robbery, and as punishment was lashed and committed to three months hard labour. He was subsequently released on account of insufficient evidence against him. The treatment he received did not sit well with many of the !Ikora raiders, and this spurred them into increased levels of livestock pillaging that belonged to the settlers throughout the region.\n\nA three hundred-man strong commando under Special Magistrate Maxmillian Jackson was deployed to try and deal with Rooi and Kivido’s activities, and although Kivido was killed in the insurgence, the attack was considered a failure as the commando struggled to navigate the islands due to limited understanding of the river's layout. As a result, the efforts to deter the !Kora from any more raids were increased. The authorities bribed two leaders of the most powerful groups, Lukas and Cupido Pofadder. They were given protection in exchange for information on the other marauding groups. Lukas orchestrated the recapture of Rooi and some of his cohorts, and handed them over to the Special Magistrate, and about 400 men were sentenced to Robben Island.\n\nThose who were able to evade capture retreated into the Kalahari Desert. Some among the captured !Kora were forced back into manual labour on white farms, while others succumbed to smallpox. In effect, the entire !Kora community was destroyed, and some of their prominent lead raiders spent decades behind bars. By the time they were released, they were too old and frail to resume their activities, and the !Kora people were too scattered to mobilise once more.\n\n\n"}

He's regarded as one of the most important Shia \"Mujtahid\" at the time. He was a lecturer at Najaf seminary for years and significant number of students from \"different regions of the Muslim world\" used to participate his lectures. His most famous work is \"The Sufficiency\" () where he gathered the jurispurdential ideas such as `continuity` and \"presented them in a yet more rigorous fashion as a unified theory of jurisprudence.\"\n\nHe is known for using his position as a marja for political use in the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905-1911) where he was one of the main clerical supporters of the revolution. He believed that \"constitutional form of government\" would be the best possible choice in the absence of Imam and regarded the \"Persian revolution\" a \"Jihad\" (\"holy war\") in which all Muslims had to participate.\n\nHe died \"suddenly\" and \"mysteriously\", when he aimed to leave Iraq for Iran in order against support constitutionalists' resistance to the Anglo-Russian invasion in 1911.\n\nKhorasani was born in Mashhad where he did his early educations. Then he left for Sabzevar at 20 where he got familiar with Islamic philosophy under Molla Hadi Sabzavari. He continued Islamic philosophy under Molla Hosayn Khoʾi at the Sadr seminary in Tehran, the city where he learnt Logic and Hekmat. In 1861 he moved to Iraq and in Najaf worked on complementary studies under Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi, famous for his campaign against the tobacco concession. Also he studied about two years under Morteza Ansari. Both Morteza Ansari and Mirza Hassan Shirazi were \"marja-e taqlid\" (\"models for emulation\") at the time.\n\nShirazi's move Samarra provided a suitable opportunity for Akhund Khorasani to show his skill in \"feqh\" and \"osul\" in Najaf while being supported by Shirazi. After Shirazi's death he was recognized as a \"a great religious leader.\" Some authors such as Ali Davani and Shahrestani regard him as the \"sole \"marja-e taqlid\" immediately after Shirazi.\" He's also regarded as \"an unquestionable master of osul al-feqh before Mohammad Fazel Sarabiani’s death.\"\n\nHe was a lecturer at Najaf seminary for years and significant number of students from \"different regions of the Muslim world\" used to participate his lectures. His most famous work is \"The Sufficiency\" () which ranks \"only after Morteza Ansari's treatice on commercial law\" among the legal works written by mullahs in the last two centuries. In \"The Sufficiency\", Khorasani gathered the jurispurdential ideas such as `continuity` and \"presented them in a yet more rigorous fashion as a unified theory of jurisprudence.\" Khorasani was not a sayyed but \"owed his position almost purely to his intellectual accomplishments.\"\n\nUnder Khorasani's leadership, the Usuli position became the dominant view.\n\nAlthough he warned the scholars for not involving in political activities as he believed that they had other responsibilities, he believed that scholars could act as \"warning voices in society\" and criticize the officials who were not doing their responsibilities correctly. He compared the role of scholars with \"salt of the earth\" in the sense that they prevent \"decay of power\", should fight against injustice and that they are against \"autocratic attitudes\"\n\nThe first known Akhund Khorasani's anti-government political activities is related to \"the unrest following the two Russian loans to Mozaffar-al-din Shah.\"\n\nMohammad Kazem Khorasani was also one of the main clerical supporters of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution and along with Mirza Hosayn Tehrani and Shaikh Abdallah Mazandarani he led people against what they called a \"state tyranny\" and issued fatwas and \"sent telegrams to tribal chiefs, prominent national and political leaders, and heads of state in England, France, Germany, and Turkey.\" When Mohammad Ali Shah became king of Iran, Mohammad Kazem Khorasani sent him a \"ten-point\" instruction including points on ptotecting Islam, promoting domestic industries and modern science, stopping foreign powers' intervention in Iran \"while retaining diplomatic relations\", and establishing \"justice and equality\".\n\nHe believed that \"constitutional form of government\" would be the best possible choice in the absence of Imam and regarded the \"Persian revolution\" a \"Jihad\" (\"holy war\") in which all Muslims had to participate. When Sheikh Fazlollah Noori declared journalists non-Muslims for their support of the new Constitutional Assembly, Khorasani retaliated by announcing that Sheikh Fazlollah was himself no longer a Muslim, leading to Fazlollah's execution. The reaction to Noori's execution in Najaf harmed Khorasani and other constitution supporters and led to a rivalry with Mohammed Kazem Yazdi. Khorsani acted more intensively against Mohammad Ali Shah when he shelled the parliament building and executed many \"constitutionalists\".\n\nHe apparently did not have ties with Oudh Bequest nor he favored British, despite the allegations. He were in an \"equal opposition\" to Russia and Britain, two powers at the time.\n\nHe authored many books hence titled \"Innovator\" (\"al-mujaddid\") of \"Usul al-feqh\". Kifayat al-usul, Khorasani's most important book, is taught in advanced classes at the seminaries as the main text on the methodology of law. It has received \"hundreds of commentaries\". The book suppressed \"Qvanin al-Osul\" by Qummi, one of seminary main texts taught at sotuh level. Also, he wrote one of the most important commentaries on Shaykh Morteza al-Ansari's \"Durar al-fawaid fi sharh al-Faraid\", also taught alongside Kifayat al-usul.\n\nAyatollah Mirza Hussein Naini, Ayatollah Muhammad Hossein Qaravi, Agha Zia Addin Araghi were among his students.\n\nHe died \"suddenly\" and \"mysteriously\", when he aimed to leave Iraq for Iran in order against support constitutionalists' resistance to the Anglo-Russian invasion in 1911.\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Kansas State University in 1967 with a B.A. in physical science and a B.S. in botany and zoology. He earned his master's degree in 1969 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a student of botanist Hugh Iltis, with a thesis on the genus \"Tabebuia\" (Bignoniaceae) of Central America, a subject which he continued to study at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, from which he received his doctorate in 1972, with a Ph.D. thesis entitled \"An Eco-evolutionary Study of the Bignoniaceae of South Central America\".\n\nGentry spent his entire working career at the Missouri Botanical Garden, starting as an assistant curator in October 1972. In 1974, he made his first visit to Peru, a country that became the major focus of much of his subsequent work; he made his second trip there in 1976 and by the time of his death had visited the country 33 times. He also maintained his interest in the Bignoniaceae: he contributed treatments of the family to nine volumes, including the \"Flora of Panama\", and had a further five in press when he died.\n\nOne of Gentry's major innovations was the use of transect samples as a tool for assessing the composition and structure of tropical forests, known as the Gentry Forest Transect. His method, allied to his encyclopedic knowledge of tropical plants, allowed him to sample a site in a matter of days, and over the course of his career he amassed data from over 200 such transects worldwide.\n\nAlwyn Gentry was prolific both as an author and as a plant collector: he published over 200 works and had many more on hand at the time of his death; and he collected over 80,000 plant specimens, hundreds of which have proved to be species new to science. Because many of the plants that he encountered during his transect sampling were not flowering, Gentry developed the ability to identify species from vegetative specimens, not just from flowers and fruits, an ability that led to the publication of his \"Field Guide to the Families and Genera of Woody Plants of Northwest South America\", completed just months before his death.\n\nIn 1990, Conservation International established a Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) to undertake quick assessments of areas deemed to be significant for conservation. Gentry's transect method was well suited to such work and he became increasingly involved as a member of the RAP team.\n\nOn 3 August 1993, Alwyn Gentry was on a RAP mission in western Ecuador, when the light aircraft in which he was travelling crashed into a mountain ridge near Guayaquil. Four people—the pilot, Gentry, American ornithologist Theodore A. Parker III, and Ecuadorian ecologist Eduardo Aspiazu—died in the crash; three other researchers survived. Parker and Gentry are memorialized in the annual Parker/Gentry Award for Conservation Biology of the Field Museum of Natural History.\n\nSeveral plant species have been named after Gentry, including: \"Acidocroton gentryi, Citharexylum gentryi, Crossothamnus gentryi, Eleutherodactylus gentryi, Hedyosmum gentryi, Metalepis gentryi, Palicourea gentryi, Phyllanthus gentryi, Sobralia gentryi\" and \"Zamia gentryi\", as well as a bird, \"Herpsilochmus gentryi\". In several instances, Gentry had been involved in the collection of the type specimens of these plants.\n"}

He is a Christian and calls his music ‘about being human’. It’s this approach that has allowed him to be successful as a mainstream artist.\n\nGray was born Christon Michael Gray on July 18, 1986, in Columbus, Ohio. His parents, Arthur Gray (a former choir leader), and his mother Leigh Ann (a trained soprano) have two other children; Christon’s older brother, Taelor Gray, who is also a rapper and pastor, and his younger sister Aubrey, who is currently a college student. He resides in Columbus and has a daughter named Mya Blue.\n\nIn 2006, Gray was a part of The Elevationists with his brother, Taelor and childhood friend BJ (James Hazley). After a few years together, they disbanded the group.\n\nIn 2011, Gray, with the help of writing partner and music director Marlo Scott, released an album entitled \"Even With Evil With Me.\" The independent release spawned the timeless track ‘Isle of You’, which quickly led to record label interest. Before the year was out, he was signed to Collision Records.\n\nIn 2012, he began working on his retail and label debut for Collision, but as it morphed, he decided to release it as a free mixtape. \"Body Art\" was a hit among Gray's fans and featured the label's roster as well as other artists and producers from the CHH genre. It caught many fans off guard because it was more of a rap album than EWEWM, which was the album’s intention.\n\nEarly in 2013, the label released the collective album \"We Live As Kings (W.L.A.K.)\". As a member of the four-man group, Christon was featured on the majority of the tracks. The album went on to top the Billboard Gospel chart and crack the top 10 on the Rap and Christian charts. It also contained the cut 'King In Me' which was used as the theme song to American Idol’s Super Bowl commercial in 2014.\n\nOn March 25, 2014, Gray released his 2nd studio album entitled \"School of Roses\". It included fan favorites ‘Vanish’ (feat. Swoope) and ‘Wanna’ (feat. JGivens) which peaked at #15 on the Billboard Live Trending chart. This was more of an R&B album than \"Body Art\", and it debuted at the top of the overall charts on iTunes, and hit #44 on the Billboard Top 200 and #5 on Top R&B Albums.\n\nIn early 2015, Gray began releasing music on his own, prompting fans to question whether or not he was still a part of Collision and W.L.A.K. The first track 'Open Door (See You Later)' was posted on his Soundcloud page in March of 2015. Still not addressing his status, one week later he posted the beautiful piano led love ballad, 'Afraid With You'. Lastly, he posted ‘Light On’ featuring B.Reith the following week. On April 28, 2015, after confirming he was leaving Collision in an interview with Wade-O & Rapzilla, Gray released an EP called \"The Demos\" to be streamed exclusively on the Christian music-streaming app, \"The Overflow\". The album went to be the most streamed project on the entire service for 2015, with all 5 tracks occupying spots #1 - #5 the week of its release.\n\nIt became clear that he was using these songs to get himself a new record deal, and in June 2015, he revealed that he had signed with Kirk Franklin's label, Fo Yo Soul Recordings/RCA. Kirk himself made the announcement via video screen at \"Alive Fest\" in Ohio on June 20, 2015. He subsequently removed \"The Demos\" to work on his third retail album and label debut.\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Rapzilla.com released an interview via email with Gray in which he said his debut with Fo Yo Soul had been completed and was being scheduled for release during \"the colder part of 2016\".\n\nA couple weeks later, on December 2, 2015, Gray released a freestyle video that included the name and release date of his next project, \"The Glory Album\". Gray's debut album with Fo Yo Soul/RCA was set to be released on March 11, 2016.\n\nTwo weeks after that, he debuted the first new track off the album on Vevo called ‘Connor McDees’ featuring Brooklyn emcee, Skyzoo and his brother Taelor.\n\nLeading up to the album release, he was chosen as one of ESPN’s Artists of the Month for March. The station highlighted 3 tracks, ‘Open Door (See You Later)’, 'The Glory Pt. I' and ‘Stop Me' on all of their regular programing. The later track went on to be used in commercials for Honda, HBO’s Ballers, FOX's Lethal Weapon & RocNation Sports. It was also used at the ESPY Awards during the shows final segment. The remix of the song was debuted during his interview on the Sway in the Morning show in mid September 2016. The song continued success in 2017, being used on FOX Sports programming worldwide, as well as the team song for a number of professional sports franchises. In 2018, the song was used as the theme to Warner Bros Pictures blockbuster 'Rampage' starring The Rock and as the intro song to EA Sports 'Madden '19' NFL Video game. For the 2018-19 NBA Season, ESPN is using the song for it's in NBA Studio show.\n\nAlso during this time, Apple Music selected ‘Open Door (See You Later)’ and ‘Ft. Knox’ as ‘Best of the Week’ singles back to back. As well, TGA received key placements on Amazon Music, iTunes, Google Play, TIDAL, and Spotify.\n\nThe Glory Album was released on March 11, 2016. The LP went on to again claim the #5 position on the Billboard R&B charts, while also hitting #6 on the Christian chart.\n\nGray was chosen as the first ever Youth Ambassador for the BET Awards in June 2016.\n\nAfter just one album with the label, Gray let fans know that he had officially left RCA in January 2017. He did not elaborate on the reasons, but said when the time was right he would speak about it. According to the post, it was a business decision and he wishes all parties involved well.\n\nIn March 2017, Gray, along with Chris Shaban started their own Podcast entitled 'Chris' Podcast'. The first two episodes included guests Ty Montgomery, Chris Broussard and Darren Haynes. Gray mentioned that this was a pilot program and that they were looking to bring it back sometime in 2019.\n\nOn July 28, Gray dropped a single called 'No Hesitation' independently. This was his first release since leaving Fo Yo Soul/RCA Records. In an interview with Wade-O, Gray said, \"You know the inspiration for the song came from me watching the BET Awards, and I saw 'Crae's speech, and I know he caught some flack for that... I talked to Lecrae the other day, and I told him, I come from that world... I grew up listening to them and without them, you (Wade) would not be having an interview with me... so I told him (Lecrae), yo, I didn't expect you to go back and apologize, so I did it for you.\" The song would become another hit for Gray, and he went on to perform it live at the 2018 Stellar Awards.\n\nA week later, on August 4th, he released 'Shoulda Known', which included a sample of his song, 'Burning House (Roses 102)' off the School of Roses album. It featured long-time collaborator and friend, JGivens.\n\nOn Sunday November 5, Christon Gray was announced as the new Worship Leader at Christ's Church in Mason, Ohio.\n\nBy the end of the year, an agreement had been reached for him to rejoin Fo Yo Soul and the new staff at RCA Inspiration in Nashville. It would not become public until later on in 2018.\n\nBy the end of 2017 and leading into 2018, Gray let fans know that he was back writing, but did not elaborate. There weren't anymore indications until a post on Instagram in February with Chris Shaban and Ty Montgomery, taken from a writing session in Cambridge, Ontario.He would later go on to tell that 4 songs were already written by this point, with two making the album, 'Seekrets' and 'Together Forever'.\n\nIn March, there came a string of posts from the studio that included MD and producer Marlo Scott, Producer GiAngelo Power, Pastor Trevor DeVage, Montgomery and Shaban. Gray said in a post on Twitter, \"...there was a week in March 2018 when everything started to come together. That week we did 'Grow Up', 'You & I (Sampson's Lament)' and brushed up a few other songs that made the cut.\" Those other songs were 'Seekrets', 'Together Forever' and the instrumental to 'Clear The Heir'.\n\nIn April at the Stellar Awards, rumors started swirling that Christon had re-signed with Fo Yo Soul/RCA Records, and while it had happened months before, it was a post with Kirk Franklin that said \"Welcome home\" that started the buzz. One more studio picture that month and Gray took some time off of his social media and no further updates came until late in the summer.\n\nOn August 2, a post from famed Canadian studio Metalworks that read \"October 19\" and had no sound, but a studio full of his collaborators started his promotion run for the album.It would come to light later on that October 19 would be the release date for the album.\n\nOn August 24, he dropped the first single 'Together Forever' with credit going to Fo Yo Soul/Essential Sound/Sony. The track contained a portion of his September 2016 interview on Sirius XM's 'Sway In The Morning' where he discussed divorce.\n\nOn September 14, he released the albums second single 'Time Out', produced by Toronto's GiAngelo Power.

Until he resigned after being arrested on a sexual assault charge, he was best known as a founder/director of Defense Distributed, a non-profit organization that develops and publishes open source gun designs, so-called \"wiki weapons\", suitable for 3D printing and digital manufacture. \nHe is a co-founder of the Dark Wallet bitcoin storage technology.\n\nDefense Distributed gained international notoriety in 2013 when it published plans online for the Liberator, a functioning pistol that could be reproduced with a 3D printer.\n\n\"Wired Magazine\"'s \"Danger Room\" named Wilson one of \"The 15 Most Dangerous People in the World\" in 2012. In 2015 and 2017 \"Wired\" named Wilson one of the five most dangerous people on the Internet. In September 2018, he was charged with sexual assault of a minor, in Austin, Texas, and was subsequently arrested in Taiwan.\n\nOriginally from Little Rock, Arkansas, Wilson was student body president at Cabot High School in Cabot, Arkansas; he graduated in 2006.\n\nWilson graduated from the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) with a bachelor's degree in English in 2010, where he had a scholarship. While at UCA, Wilson was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and was elected president of UCA's Student Government Association. He traveled to China with UCA's study-abroad program.\n\nIn 2012 he studied at the University of Texas School of Law, but left the university in 2013.\n\nIn 2012, Wilson and associates at Defense Distributed initiated the \"Wiki Weapon Project\" to raise funds for designing and releasing the files for a 3D printable gun. Wilson is, to date, the only spokesperson on behalf of the organization, of which he describes himself as \"co-founder\" and \"director\".\n\nLearning of his organization's plans, manufacturer Stratasys threatened legal action and demanded the return of a 3D printer it had leased to Wilson. On September 26, 2012, before the printer was assembled for use, Wilson received an email from Stratasys suggesting he was using the printer \"for illegal purposes\". Stratasys immediately cancelled its lease with Wilson and sent a team to confiscate the printer the next day.\n\nWhile visiting the ATF enforcement office in Austin to inquire about legalities related to his project, Wilson was subsequently interrogated by the officers there. Six months later, he was issued a Federal Firearms License (FFL) to manufacture and deal.\n\nIn May 2013, Wilson successfully test-fired a pistol, called \"the Liberator\", reportedly made by a Stratasys Dimension series 3D printer bought on eBay. After test firing, Wilson released the blueprints of the gun's design online through a Defense Distributed website named DEFCAD. The State Department Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance then demanded that he remove the files, threatening prosecution for violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).\n\nOn May 6, 2015, Defense Distributed and the gun rights group the Second Amendment Foundation filed a lawsuit against the State Department claiming a violation of their first amendment rights to free speech. On July 10, 2018, it was reported that the company won this lawsuit and would begin again its work at DEFCAD.\n\nIn the wake of being charged with sexual assault, Wilson resigned from and ended all ties with Defense Distributed on September 21, 2018.\n\nIn 2013, Wilson, along with Amir Taaki, began work on a Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet called 'Dark Wallet', a project by which he plans to help anonymize financial transactions. He appeared in support of the 'Dark Wallet' project at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas in 2014, speaking to publications such as ReasonTV.\n\nOn U.S. election day, November 4, 2014, Wilson announced in an interview that he would stand for election to a seat on the Board of Directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, with \"the sole purpose of destroying the Foundation.\" And Wilson stated: \"I will run on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation and will begin and end every single one of my public statements with that message.\"\n\nIn 2017, Wilson launched Hatreon, a crowdfunding site that provided crowdfunding and payment services for groups and individuals who were banned from crowdfunders such as Kickstarter, Patreon, PayPal, and Stripe. It was notable for featuring the controversial alt-right personalities Andrew Anglin and Richard Spencer.\nWilson said that Hatreon clients included \"right-wing women, people of color, and transgender people\", but according to Adam Popescu of Bloomberg News, \"most\" of the donations went to \"white supremacists.\" According to Hannah Shearer, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hatreon users were inciting violence contrary to Hatreon’s terms of service, which forbid illegal activity.\n\nThe site claimed to have received about $25,000 a month in donations, an amount that was \"doubling from month to month.\" Hatreon took a 5-percent cut of donations.\n\nIn November 2017, Visa suspended Hatreon and the site became dormant.\n\nWilson claims an array of influences from anti-state and libertarian political thinkers, including leftist market anarchists like the mutualist scholar Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, capitalist libertarians such as the Austrian School scholar Hans-Herman Hoppe, and classical liberals including Frederic Bastiat. His political thought has been compared to the \"conservative revolutionary\" ideas of Ernst Jünger. Jacob Siegel wrote that \"Cody Wilson arrives at a place where left, right—and democracy—disappear\" and that he oscillates \"somewhere between anarch and anarchist.\"\n\nWilson is an avowed crypto-anarchist, and has discussed his work in relation to the cypherpunks and Timothy May's vision. He frequently cites the work of post-Marxist thinkers in public comments, especially that of Jean Baudrillard, whom he has claimed as his \"master.\"\n\nAsked during an interview with \"Popular Science\" if the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting affected his thinking or plans in any way, Wilson responded, \"... understanding that rights and civil liberties are something that we protect is also understanding that they have consequences that are also protected, or tolerated. The exercise of civil liberties is antithetical to the idea of a completely totalizing state. That's just the way it is.\"\"\n\nWilson is generally opposed to intellectual property rights. He has indicated that although his primary goal is the subversion of state-structures, he also hopes that his contributions may help to dismantle the existing system of capitalist property relations.\n\nIn a January 2013 interview with Glenn Beck on the nature of and motivations behind his effort to develop and share gun 3D printable files Wilson said, \"That's a real political act, giving you a magazine, telling you that it will never be taken away. ... That's real politics. That's radical equality. That's what I believe in. ... I'm just resisting. What am I resisting? I don't know, the collectivization of manufacture? The institutionalization of the human psyche? I'm not sure. But I can tell you one thing: this is a symbol of irreversibility. They can never eradicate the gun from the earth.\"\n\nIn September 2018, charges were filed against Wilson for allegedly having sexual intercourse with a 16-year-old girl he met on SugarDaddyMeet, a website that matches older men with younger women. He is accused of committing a second-degree felony after paying $500 to the girl for sex in a hotel room in Austin, Texas in August 2018. Austin police said they were alerted by a counselor who had been working with the girl.\n\nIt is alleged that after Wilson was told that a police investigation was underway, he fled to Taipei, Taiwan, which does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S. \n\nHowever, he was subsequently arrested in Taiwan by local police and handed to the National Immigration Agency (NIA), charged with a immigration violation as his passport was revoked by the U.S. government. He was deported on September 22, 2018, and was booked by the United States Marshals Service in Harris County Jail in Houston, Texas on September 23, 2018. He was released after posting a $150,000 bond.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Brainerd Holmes\n\nDyer Brainerd Holmes (May 24, 1921 – January 11, 2013), known professionally as D. Brainerd Holmes, was an American engineer and business executive. He was perhaps best known for directing NASA's manned spaceflight program from September 1961 to June 1963, when John Glenn made the pivotal first US orbital spaceflight, but Holmes was also the president of international defense contractor Raytheon. He retired from that post in 1986.\n\nHolmes studied engineering at Cornell University, receiving a degree in electrical engineering. He first worked for Bell Labs and Western Electric, then moved to RCA, becoming heavily involved in military contracting with that firm. He helped to develop the Talos antiaircraft missile, and the electronic heart of the Atlas missile. He was part of the team that developed the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, and was therefore highly visible in government circles. In 1961, in response to the Cold War fears that had been fueled by the October 1957 Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite, US President John F. Kennedy had publicly vowed that his government would put a man on the moon, and safely return him to Earth, before the end of the decade. Holmes was hired to get it done.\n\nDuring his two-year tenure, he oversaw the Mercury program and planning for Project Gemini and the Apollo program. Possibly due to tensions with NASA Administrator James E. Webb over the extent of his authority to shape and schedule the various facets of the space program, he resigned in 1963 to become an executive at Raytheon. At that company he is credited with helping develop several of that company's missile developments, including the Patriot antiballistic system.\n\nHolmes’ leadership in the space program was highlighted by \"TIME\" magazine in 1962, wherein he was quoted: \"When a great nation is faced with a technological challenge, it has to accept or go backward. Space is the future of man, and the US must keep ahead in space.\"\n\nAt Raytheon, Holmes became a top executive, and was its president when it developed the Patriot missile in the 1970s. He also served as chairman of the Beech Aircraft Corporation after it was acquired by Raytheon in 1979.\n\nAfter Holmes was selected to lead the ballistic-missile-tracking program at RCA, Elmer Engstrom, the company president, told an interviewer, \"The problem with systems engineering is to find people with a special knack for marrying men, machines, tactics and everything else into one large system. We could see right away that Holmes had the knack.\"\n\nHolmes was featured on August 10, 1962 cover of TIME magazine, featuring the series \"Reaching For The Moon\".\n\nNASA official Robert R. Gilruth compiled a history of that administration during his tenure. Gilruth had worked hard to persuade Holmes of the merit of a lunar-orbit rendezvous as part of the Moon-landing project, and he wrote of this time that the project's success owed much to Holmes' management-team approach, in which NASA officials \"argued out our different opinions\" before a course was set. He wrote, \"A less skillful leader might have forced an early arbitrary decision that would have made the whole task of getting to the Moon virtually impossible.\"\nHolmes was nominated in 1977 by Raytheon for membership in the National Academy of Engineering. He was a member of the Electronics section of that group.\n\nHolmes was a resident of Wellesley, Massachusetts at the time of his death, but he died in a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, due to complications of pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Mary Margaret England Wilkes Holmes. He had two children from a previous marriage and three step-children at the time of death.\n"}

He is known under the infamous hacker alias \"Pink Pony\". Tenenbaum became widely famous in 1998, when aged 19 years and while he was the head of a small group of hackers, he was arrested for hacking computers belonging to NASA, The Pentagon, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the Knesset, MIT and other American and Israeli universities such as Dharma and ComTEC. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other federally funded research sites, and the computer of Israeli President Ezer Weizman, as well as attempting to infiltrate the Israel Defense Forces' classified files. He also hacked into the computers of Palestinian groups, and claimed to have destroyed the website of Hamas. Tenenbaum installed on some of the servers packet analyzer and trojan horse software. At the time then-US Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre insisted was \"the most organized and systematic attack to date\" on US military systems. The military thought that they were witnessing a sophisticated Iraqi 'information warfare'. In an effort to stop the supposed Iraqi hackers the United States government assembled agents from the FBI, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, NASA, the US Department of Justice, the Defense Information Systems Agency, the NSA, and the CIA. The government was so worried that the warning and briefings went all the way up to the President of the United States. The investigation, code-named \"Solar Sunrise,\" eventually snared two California teenagers (screen names Mac and Stimpy) but no Iraqi infowarriors. After their arrest, a subsequent probe led US investigators to Tenenbaum, who was arrested after Israeli police were given evidence of Tenenbaum's activities. Later, the FBI sent agents to Israel to question Tenenbaum.\n\nBefore he was sentenced, Tenenbaum served briefly in the Israel Defense Forces, but was released soon thereafter after he was involved in a traffic collision. \n\nIn 2001, Tenenbaum pleaded guilty, while stating that he wasn't attempting to infiltrate the computer systems to get a hold of secrets but rather to prove that the systems were flawed. Tenenbaum was sentenced to a year and a half in prison, from which he served only 8 months following the \"Deri Law\". After the attack the FBI made a short 18 minutes training video called, \"Solar Sunrise: Dawn of a New Threat\" that was sold as part of hacker defense course that was discontinued in September 2004.\n\nIn 2003, after being freed from prison, Tenenbaum founded his own Information security company called \"2XS\". \n\nIn September 2008, following an investigation by Canadian police and the US Secret Service, Tenenbaum and three accomplices were arrested in Montreal. Tenenbaum was charged with six counts of credit card fraud, in the sum of approx. US$1.5 million. U.S. investigators suspected Tenenbaum of being part of a scam, in which the hackers penetrated financial institutions around the world to steal credit card numbers. They then sold these numbers to other people, who used them to perpetrate massive credit card fraud. He was later extradited to the United States to stand trial, and was in the custody of the US Marshals for more than a year. In August 2010, he was released on bond after agreeing to plead guilty.\n\nIn July 2012, after Tenenbaum accepted a plea bargain which may have involved cooperation in the investigation, New York district judge Edward Korman sentenced Tenenbaum to the time already served in prison. Tenenbaum was also ordered to pay $503,000 and given three years' probation.\n\n"}

{"id": "4783061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4783061", "title": "Fred Holroyd", "text": "Fred Holroyd\n\nCaptain Frederick John Holroyd was a British soldier who was based at the British Army's 3 Brigade HQ in mid-Ulster, Northern Ireland during the 1970s. He enlisted as a gunner in the Royal Artillery, and three years later, in 1964, he was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps (later the Royal Corps of Transport). He volunteered for the Special Military Intelligence Unit in Northern Ireland in 1969, and he was trained at the Joint Services School of Intelligence. Once his training was finished, he was stationed in Portadown, where, for two and a half years up to 1975, he ran a series of intelligence operations. He resigned from the Army in 1976.\n\nHolroyd described a policy of assassinations and collusion between the British Army Intelligence Corps and Ulster loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. Holroyd was one of a number of former members of British forces who either exposed or admitted to such activity, the most prominent being Colin Wallace and John Weir (see Dublin and Monaghan bombings).\n\nHolroyd also claimed that during the mid-1970s the Special Air Service (SAS) used the cover name, \"4 Field Survey Troop, Royal Engineers\" (see 14 Intelligence Company) during operations. This modus operandi was introduced in 1973 and abandoned in 1975. Fred Holroyd claimed this was an SAS unit under cover at the Royal Engineers' base at Castledillon, County Armagh, which he visited (see 14 Intelligence Company). Holroyd said he worked with the members of this unit and that members were told that it was a NITAT (Northern Ireland Training and Tactics Team), whose personnel were \"former, serving or recently trained\" SAS soldiers, with the commanders being infantry officers attached to the SAS. One of these was Captain Robert Nairac, described as, \"seconded to 14th Intelligence\", otherwise known as 14 Intelligence Company\" or '14 Int'.\n\nHe also added to allegations that a cabal of right-wing British intelligence operatives from MI5 and the SIS, along with figures from the British establishment, had been involved in a plot to destabilise/overthrow Prime Minister Harold Wilson through a secret organization known as \"Group 13\". The former intelligence officer Peter Wright, author of \"Spycatcher\", was said to have been part of this group. Holroyd's allegations surfaced again in a \"New Statesman\" article written by Duncan Campbell in 1984. Holroyd's allegations helped form the basis for the 1990 Ken Loach film, \"Hidden Agenda\". \n\nLabour Member of Parliament in the UK, Ken Livingstone, formerly Head of the Greater London Council, latterly Mayor of London, took up the case of Fred Holroyd, and used his maiden speech as MP to highlight Holroyd's allegations.\n\nLivingstone also asked a series of questions in the parliament session about Holroyd's treatment following his allegations of collusion between British Army Intelligence and loyalist paramilitaries. \n\nFollowing the surfacing of these allegations Holroyd claims to have been forcibly retired from MI6 and placed in a mental health institution. Holroyd has campaigned since then to have the Ministry of Defence admit that he was wrongly institutionalised. \n\nHolroyd wrote the book \"War without Honour\" with Nick Burbridge. It was published in 1989.\n\nHolroyd gave evidence to Mr Justice Henry Barron during his inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings of 17 May 1974. Holroyd stated that \"the bombings were part of a pattern of collusion between elements of the security forces in Northern Ireland and loyalist paramilitaries.\"\n\nBarron was asked about a seeming contradiction in Holroyd's input to the report during public hearings:\n\nWhen asked at a public hearing what he meant by \"compromise source\", Barron replied:\n\nThere are many reports on him suggesting that he is a Walter Mitty type. That is probably the easiest way of explaining it... We said his detail was totally unreliable but the substance related to events which took place.\n\nIn his official statement to the Oireachtas joint Committee, Barron stated: \n\nA number of Holroyd's allegations are not completely true, but they relate to events that did happen. Insofar as they raise serious questions concerning the behaviour of the security forces, North and South during the 1970s, they are of relevance to the work of this Inquiry, and have contributed to the Inquiry's view on the possibility of collusion between elements of the security forces in Northern Ireland and loyalist paramilitaries. \n\nBarron also stated in his Report,\n\nIt must be said that when interviewed by the Inquiry [Holroyd] made no effort to avoid any questions asked of him; nor did he appear to be withholding information. He gave his answers openly, fairly and with conviction. He is aware that he has been misquoted and misinterpreted on occasion and has sought to correct any misapprehensions where they have arisen. He has also shown a willingness to take on board evidence and information which seem to contradict his claims, though for the most part he has maintained the truth of his allegations and of their provenance.\n\nIn his report Barron found that members of the Gardaí and of the RUC attempted to unfairly and unjustly undermine the evidence and character of Holroyd. For instance \n\nHolroyd was also proven correct in his allegation that a Garda officer arranged a meeting in Dublin between an Irish Army EOD officer and his British counterpart. The denial of the Garda officer concerned that he requested Holroyd organise the meeting should be read in the light of his attempts to deny knowing or meeting Holroyd at all, which are not convincing.\n\nBarron also noted, \n\nSome of the RUC officers interviewed by the Inquiry, in their apparent eagerness to deny Holroyd any credibility whatsoever, themselves made inaccurate and misleading statements which have unfortunately tarnished their own credibility.\n\nThen Assistant Commissioner of the Gardaí (Republic of Ireland police force), Edmund Garvey denied that he had met Holroyd at Garda headquarters in 1975. Holroyd named Garvey, and another Garda (codename: \"the badger\"), as being on the \"British side\". Justice Barron found: \"The visit by Holroyd to Garda Headquarters unquestionably did take place, notwithstanding former Commissioner Garvey's inability to recall it\". Barron further noted: \n\nOn the Northern side, there is conflicting evidence as to how, why and by whom the visit was arranged. Regrettably, Garda investigations have failed to uncover any documentary evidence of the visit, or to identify any of the officers involved in arranging it from the Southern side.\n\nOn 19 January 1978, then Commissioner Edmund Garvey was sacked without explanation by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government, which stated that it no longer had \"confidence\" in him as Garda Commissioner. \n\n"}

From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo joined with members of three other Chiricahua Apache bands—the Tchihende, the Tsokanende and the Nednhi—to carry out numerous raids as well as resistance to US and Mexican military campaigns in the northern Mexico states of Chihuahua and Sonora, and in the southwestern American territories of New Mexico and Arizona. Geronimo's raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache–United States conflict, which started with American settlement in Apache lands following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848.\n\nWhile well known, Geronimo was not a chief among the Chiricahua or the Bedonkohe band. At any one time, about 30 to 50 Apaches would be following him. However, since he was a superb leader in raiding and warfare he frequently led large numbers of men and women beyond his own following.\n\nDuring Geronimo's final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886 he \"surrendered\" three times and accepted life on the Apache reservations in Arizona. Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people, and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life.\n\nIn 1886, after an intense pursuit in Northern Mexico by U.S. forces that followed Geronimo's third 1885 reservation \"breakout\", Geronimo surrendered for the last time to Lt. Charles Bare Gatewood, an Apache-speaking West Point graduate who had earned Geronimo's respect a few years before. Geronimo was later transferred to General Nelson Miles at Skeleton Canyon, just north of the Mexican/American boundary. Miles treated Geronimo as a prisoner of war and acted promptly to remove Geronimo first to Fort Bowie, then to the railroad at Bowie Station, Arizona where he and 27 other Apaches were sent off to join the rest of the Chiricahua tribe which had been previously exiled to Florida.\n\nIn his old age, Geronimo became a celebrity. He appeared at fairs, including the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, where he reportedly rode a ferris wheel and sold souvenirs and photographs of himself. However, he was not allowed to return to the land of his birth. He died at the Fort Sill hospital in 1909. He was still a prisoner of war. He is buried at the Fort Sill Indian Agency Cemetery surrounded by the graves of relatives and other Apache prisoners of war.\n\nApache is the collective term for several culturally related groups of Native Americans originally from the Southwest United States. The current division of Apachean groups includes the Western Apache, Chiricahua, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan and Plains Apache (formerly Kiowa-Apache).\n\nDuring the centuries of Apache-Mexican and Apache-United States conflict, raiding had become embedded in the Apache way of life, used not only for strategic purposes but also as an economic enterprise, and often there was overlap between raids for economic need and warfare. Raids ranged from stealing livestock and other plunder, to the capture and/or killing of victims, sometimes by torture. Mexicans and Americans responded with retaliatory attacks against the Apache which were no less violent and were very seldom limited to identified individual adult enemies. The raiding and retaliation fed the fires of a virulent revenge warfare that reverberated back and forth between Apaches and Mexicans and later, Apaches and Americans. From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo, as well as other Apache leaders, conducted attacks, but Geronimo was driven by a desire to take revenge for the murder of his family and accumulated a record of brutality during this time that was unmatched by any of his contemporaries. His fighting ability extending over 30 years forms a major characteristic of his persona.\n\nAmong Geronimo's own Chiricahua tribe many had mixed feelings about him. While respected as a skilled and effective leader of raids or warfare, he emerges as not very likable, and he was not widely popular among the other Apache. This was primarily because he refused to give in to American government demands leading to some Apaches fearing the American responses to Geronimo's sense of Indian nationalism. Nevertheless, Apache people stood in awe of Geronimo's \"powers\" which he demonstrated to them on a series of occasions. These powers indicated to other Apaches that Geronimo had super-natural gifts that he could use for good or ill. In eye-witness accounts by other Apaches, Geronimo was able to become aware of distant events as they happened, and he was able to anticipate events that were in the future. He also demonstrated powers to heal other Apaches.\n\nGeronimo was born to the Bedonkohe band of the Apache, near Turkey Creek, a tributary of the Gila River in the modern-day state of New Mexico, then part of Mexico, though the Apache disputed Mexico's claim. His grandfather, Mahko, had been chief of the Bedonkohe Apache. He had three brothers and four sisters.\n\nHis parents raised him according to Apache traditions; after the death of his father, his mother took him to live with the Tchihende and he grew up with them. Geronimo married a woman named Alope, from the Nedni-Chiricahua band of Apache when he was 17; they had three children. She was the first of nine wives. On March 5, 1858, a company of 400 Mexican soldiers from Sonora led by Colonel José María Carrasco attacked Geronimo's camp outside Janos (Kas-Ki-Yeh in Apache) while the men were in town trading. Among those killed were his wife, children and mother. The loss of his family led Geronimo to hate all Mexicans for the rest of his life; he and his followers would frequently attack and kill any group of Mexicans that they encountered. Recalling that at the time his band was at peace with the Mexicans, Geronimo remembered the incident as follows:\nLate one afternoon when returning from town we were met by a few women and children who told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous — a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.\nGeronimo's chief, Mangas Coloradas, sent him to Cochise's band for help in his revenge against the Mexicans. It was during this incident that the name \"Geronimo\" came about. This appellation stemmed from a battle in which, ignoring a deadly hail of bullets, he repeatedly attacked Mexican soldiers with a knife. The origin of the name is a source of controversy with historians, some writing that it was appeals by the soldiers to Saint Jerome (\"Jeronimo!\") for help. Others source it as the mispronunciation of his name by the Mexican soldiers.\n\nGeronimo was raised with the traditional religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, he wrote in his 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death ... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.\nIn his later years Geronimo embraced Christianity, and stated\n\nSince my life as a prisoner has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers ... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to live right.\n\nHe joined the Dutch Reformed Church in 1903, but four years later was expelled for gambling. To the end of his life, he seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings, telling the Christian missionaries at a summer camp meeting in 1908 that he wanted to start over, while at the same time telling his tribesmen that he held to the old Apache religion.\n\nThe first Apache raids on Sonora and Chihuahua took place during the late 17th century. To counter the early Apache raids on Spanish settlements, presidios were established at Janos (1685) in Chihuahua and at Fronteras (1690) in northern eastern modern state of Chihuahua (then Opata country). In 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps. Two years later, Mangas Coloradas became principal chief and war leader and began a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans. Apache raids on Mexican villages were so numerous and brutal that no area was safe. Between 1820 and 1835 alone, some 5000 Mexicans died in Apache raids, and 100 settlements were destroyed. Later, as a leader, Geronimo was notorious for urging raids and war on Mexican Provinces and American locations in the southwest.\n\nEarly in his life, Geronimo became invested in the continuing and relentless cycle of revenge warfare between the Apaches and Mexicans. On March 5, 1851, when Geronimo was in his 20s, a force of Mexican militia from Sonora under Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco attacked and surprised an Apache camp outside of Janos, Chihuahua, slaughtering the inhabitants, including Geronimo's family. Col. Carrasco claimed he had followed the Apaches to Janos, Chihuahua after they had conducted a raid in Sonora, taken livestock and other plunder and badly defeated Mexican militia. Geronimo was absent at the time of the attack on the Apache camp, but when he returned he found that his mother, wife, and his three children were among the dead. In retaliation, Geronimo joined in an extended series of revenge attacks against the Mexicans. This event left Geronimo with a bitter and very personal hatred for Mexicans, and he often killed them indiscriminately and with a special vehemence. Throughout Geronimo's adult life his antipathy, suspicion and dislike for Mexicans was demonstrably greater than for Americans.\n\nAttacks and counter-attacks were common. In December 1860, 30 miners launched a surprise attack on an encampment of Bedonkohes Apaches on the west bank of the Mimbres River of modern New Mexico. According to historian Edwin R. Sweeney, the miners \"...killed four Indians, wounded others, and captured thirteen women and children.\" Retaliation by the Apache again followed, with raids against U.S. citizens and property.\n\nAccording to \"National Geographic\", \"the governor of Sonora claimed in 1886 that in the last five months of Geronimo's wild career, his band of 16 warriors slaughtered some 500 to 600 Mexicans.\"\n\nIn 1873 the Mexicans once again attacked the Apache. After months of fighting in the mountains, the Apaches and Mexicans decided on a peace treaty at Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico. After terms were agreed, the Mexican troops gave mescal to the Apaches and, while they were intoxicated, they attacked and killed 20 Apaches and captured some. The Apache were forced to retreat into the mountains once again.\n\nThough outnumbered, Geronimo fought against both Mexican and United States troops and became famous for his daring exploits and numerous escapes from capture from 1858 to 1886. One such escape, as legend has it, took place in the Robledo Mountains of southwest New Mexico. The legend states that Geronimo and his followers entered a cave, and the U.S. soldiers waited outside the entrance for him, but he never came out. Later, it was heard that Geronimo was spotted outside, nearby. The second entrance through which he escaped has yet to be found and the cave is still called Geronimo's Cave, even though no reference to this event or this cave has been found in the historic or oral record. Moreover, there are many stories of this type with other caves referenced that state that Geronimo or other Apaches entered to escape troops, but were not seen exiting. These stories are in all likelihood apocryphal.\n\nAfter about a year some trouble arose between them and the Indians, and I took the war path as a warrior, not as a chief. I had not been wronged, but some of my people had been, and I fought with my tribe; for the soldiers and not the Indians were at fault.\n\nAt the end of his military career, he led a small band of 38 men, women, and children. They evaded thousands of Mexican and American troops for over a year, making him the most famous Native American of the time and earning him the title of the \"worst Indian who ever lived\" among white settlers. According to James L. Haley, \"About two weeks after the escape there was a report of a family massacred near Silver City; one girl was taken alive and hanged from a meat hook jammed under the base of her skull.\" His band was one of the last major forces of independent Native American warriors who refused to accept the United States occupation of the American West.\n\nThe Apache–United States conflict was itself a direct outgrowth of the much older Apache–Mexican conflict which had been ongoing in the same general area since the beginning of Mexican/Spanish settlement in the 1600s.\n\nOn May 17, 1885, a number of Apache including Nana, Mangus (son of Mangas Coloradas), Chihuahua, Naiche, Geronimo, and their followers fled the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona after a show of force against the reservation's commanding officer Britton Davis. The people, who had lived as semi-nomads for generations, disliked the restrictive reservation system. Department of Arizona General George Crook dispatched two columns of troops into Mexico, the first commanded by Captain Emmet Crawford and the second by Captain Wirt Davis. Each was composed of a troop of cavalry (usually about forty men) and about 100 Apache scouts. They pursued the Apache through the summer and fall through Mexican Chihuahua and back across the border into the United States. The Apache continually raided settlements, killing other Native Americans and civilians and stealing horses.\n\nWhile Apaches were shielded from the violence of warfare on the reservation, disability and death from diseases like malaria was much more prevalent. On the other hand, rations were provided by the government, though at times the corruption of Indian agents caused rationing to become perilously scarce. Rebelling against reservation life, other Apache leaders had led their bands in \"breakouts\" from the reservations. On three separate occasions — August 1878; September 1881; May 1885—Geronimo led his band of followers in \"breakouts\" from the reservation to return to their former nomadic life associated with raiding and warfare. Following each breakout, Geronimo and his band would flee across Arizona and New Mexico to Mexico, killing and plundering as they went, and establish a new base in the rugged and remote Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains. In Mexico, they were insulated from pursuit by U.S. armed forces. The Apache knew the rough terrain of the Sierras intimately, which helped them elude pursuit and protected them from attack. The Sierra Madre mountains lie on the border between the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua, which allowed the Apache access to raid and plunder the small villages, haciendas, wagon trains, worker camps and travelers in both states. From Mexico, Apache bands also staged surprise raids back into the United States, often seeking to replenish his band's supply of guns and ammunition. In these raids into the United States the Apaches moved swiftly and attacked isolated ranches, wagon trains, prospectors, and travelers. During these raids the Apaches often killed all the persons they encountered in order to avoid detection and pursuit as long as possible before they slipped back over the border into Mexico.\n\nThe \"breakouts\" and the subsequent resumption of Apache raiding and warfare caused the Mexican Army and militia, as well as United States forces to pursue and attempt to kill or apprehend off-reservation \"renegade\" Apache bands, including Geronimo's, wherever they could be found. Because the Mexican army and militia units of Sonora and Chihuahua were unable to suppress the several Chiricahua bands based in the Sierra Madre mountains, in 1883 Mexico allowed the United States to send troops into Mexico to continue their pursuit of Geronimo's band and the bands of other Apache leaders. The United States Army operating under the command of General George Crook successfully utilized scout/combat units recruited from among the Apache people and led by American officers. These Apache units proved effective in finding the mountain strongholds of the Apache bands, and killing or capturing them. It was highly unsettling for Geronimo's band to realize their own tribesmen had helped find their hiding places. Over time this persistent pursuit by both Mexican and American forces discouraged Geronimo and other similar Apache leaders, and caused a steady and irreplaceable attrition of the members of their bands, which taken all together eroded their will to resist and led to their ultimate capitulation.\n\nCrook was under increased pressure from the government in Washington. He launched a second expedition into Mexico and on January 9, 1886, Crawford located Geronimo and his band. His Indian scouts attacked the next morning and captured the Apache's herd of horses and their camp equipment. The Apaches were demoralized and agreed to negotiate for surrender. Before the negotiations could be concluded, Mexican troops arrived and mistook the Apache scouts for the enemy Apache. The Mexican government had accused the scouts of taking advantage of their position to conduct theft, robbery, and murder in Mexico. They attacked and killed Captain Crawford. Lt. Maus, the senior officer, met with Geronimo, who agreed to meet with General Crook. Geronimo named as the meeting place the Cañon de los Embudos (Canyon of the Funnels), in the Sierra Madre Mountains about from Fort Bowie and about south of the international border, near the Sonora/Chihuahua border.\n\nDuring the three days of negotiations, photographer C. S. Fly took about 15 exposures of the Apache on glass negatives. One of the pictures of Geronimo with two of his sons standing alongside was made at Geronimo's request. Fly's images are the only existing photographs of Geronimo's surrender. His photos of Geronimo and the other free Apaches, taken on March 25 and 26, are the only known photographs taken of an American Indian while still at war with the United States. Among the Indians was a white boy Jimmy McKinn, also photographed by Fly, who had been abducted from his ranch in New Mexico, September 1885.\n\nGeronimo, camped on the Mexican side of the border, agreed to Crook's surrender terms. That night, a soldier who sold them whiskey said that his band would be murdered as soon as they crossed the border. Geronimo, Nachite, and 39 of his followers slipped away during the night. Crook exchanged a series of heated telegrams with General Philip Sheridan defending his men's actions, until on April 1, 1886, he sent a telegram asking Sheridan to relieve him of command, which Sheridan was all too willing to do.\n\nSheridan replaced Crook with General Nelson A. Miles. In 1886, General Miles selected Captain Henry Lawton to command B Troop, 4th Cavalry, at Fort Huachuca, and First Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood, to lead the expedition that brought Geronimo and his followers back to the reservation system for a final time. Lawton was given orders to head up actions south of the U.S.–Mexico boundary, where it was thought that Geronimo and a small band of his followers would take refuge from U.S. authorities. Lawton was to pursue, subdue, and return Geronimo to the U.S., dead or alive.\n\nLawton's official report dated September 9, 1886 sums up the actions of his unit and gives credit to a number of his troopers for their efforts. Geronimo gave Gatewood credit for his decision to surrender as Gatewood was well known to Geronimo, spoke some Apache, and was familiar with and honored their traditions and values. He acknowledged Lawton's tenacity for wearing the Apaches down with constant pursuit. Geronimo and his followers had little or no time to rest or stay in one place. Completely worn out, the little band of Apaches returned to the U.S. with Lawton and officially surrendered to General Miles on September 4, 1886 at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona.\n\nWhen Geronimo surrendered, he had in his possession a Winchester Model 1876 lever-action rifle with a silver-washed barrel and receiver, bearing Serial Number 109450. It is on display at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York. Additionally, he had a Colt Single Action Army revolver with a nickel finish and ivory stocks bearing the serial number 89524, and a Sheffield Bowie knife with a dagger type blade and a stag handle made by George Wostenholm in an elaborate silver-studded holster and cartridge belt. The revolver, rig, and knife are on display at the Fort Sill museum.\n\nThe debate remains as to whether Geronimo surrendered unconditionally. He pleaded in his memoirs that his people who surrendered had been misled, and that his surrender as a war prisoner in front of uncontested witnesses (especially General Stanley) was conditional. General Oliver O. Howard, chief of US Army Division of the Pacific, said on his part that Geronimo's surrender was accepted as that of a dangerous outlaw without condition. Howard's account was contested in front of the US Senate.\n\nGeronimo and other Apaches, including the Apache scouts who had helped the army track him down, were sent as prisoners to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio Texas. The Army held them there for about six weeks before they were sent to Fort Pickens, in Pensacola, Florida, and his family was sent to Fort Marion (the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, Florida). This prompt action prevented the Arizona civil authorities from intervening to arrest and try Geronimo for the death of the many Americans who had been killed during the previous decades of raiding.\n\n\"In that alien climate,\" the \"Washington Post\" reported, \"the Apache died 'like flies at frost time.' Businessmen there soon had the idea to have Geronimo serve as a tourist attraction, and hundreds of visitors daily were let into the fort to lay eyes on the 'bloodthirsty' Indian in his cell.\"\n\nWhile the POWs were in Florida, the government relocated hundreds of their children from their Arizona reservation to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. More than a third of the students quickly perished from tuberculosis, \"died as though smitten with the plague,\" the \"Post\" reported.\n\nThe Chiricahuas remained at Fort Pickens in Florida until 1888 when they were relocated to Mt. Vernon Barracks in Alabama, where they were reunited with their families. After 1/4 of the population died of tuberculosis, the Chiricahuas, including Geronimo, were relocated to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1894; they built villages scattered around the post based on kindred groups. Geronimo, like other Apaches, was given a plot of land on which he took up farming activities.\n\nOn the train ride to Fort Sill, many tourists wanted a \"piece\" of Geronimo so they paid 25 cents for a button that he cut off his shirt or a hat he took off his head. As the train would pull into depots along the way, Geronimo would buy more buttons to sew on and more hats to sell.\n\nIn 1898 Geronimo was part of a Chiricahua delegation from Fort Sill to the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition in Omaha, Nebraska. Previous newspaper accounts of the Apache Wars had impressed the public with Geronimo's name and exploits, and in Omaha he became a star attraction. The Omaha Exposition launched Geronimo to celebrity status, and for the rest of his life he was in demand as an attraction in fairs large and small. The two largest were the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo, New York, in 1901, and the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904. Under Army guard, Geronimo dressed in traditional clothing and posed for photographs and sold his crafts.\n\nAfter the fair, Pawnee Bill’s Wild West Show brokered an agreement with the government to have Geronimo join the show, again under Army guard. The Indians in Pawnee Bill’s show were depicted as \"lying, thieving, treacherous, murderous\" monsters who had killed hundreds of men, women and children and would think nothing of taking a scalp from any member of the audience, given the chance. Visitors came to see how the \"savage\" had been \"tamed,\" and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious Apache \"chief.\" (Geronimo was not a chief.) The shows put a good deal of money in his pockets and allowed him to travel, though never without government guards.\n\nIn President Teddy Roosevelt's 1905 Inaugural Parade Geronimo rode horseback down Pennsylvania Avenue with five real Indian chiefs, who wore full headgear and painted faces. The intent, one newspaper stated, was to show Americans \"that they have buried the hatchet forever.\" They created a sensation and brought the crowds along the parade route to their feet. Later that same week Geronimo met with the President and made a moving request for the Chiricahuas at Fort Sill to be relieved of their status as prisoners of war, and allowed to return to their homeland in Arizona. President Roosevelt refused, referring to the continuing animosity in Arizona for the deaths of civilian men, women, and children associated with Geronimo's raids during the prolonged Apache Wars. Through an interpreter, Roosevelt told Geronimo that the Indian had a \"bad heart.\" \"You killed many of my people; you burned villages…and were not good Indians.\" The president would have to wait a while \"and see how you and your people act\" on their reservation.\n\nIn 1905, Geronimo agreed to tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain permission to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing exactly what he wanted to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.\n\nWhen I was at first asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I did not wish to go. Later, when I was told that I would receive good attention and protection, and that the President of the United States said that it would be all right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of whom I had never heard ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans I am sure I should have been compelled to defend myself often.\n\nGeronimo married Chee-hash-kish and had two children, Chappo and Dohn-say. Then he took another wife, Nana-tha-thtith, with whom he had one child. He later had a wife named Zi-yeh at the same time as another wife, She-gha, one named Shtsha-she and later a wife named Ih-tedda. Geronimo's ninth and last wife was Azul.\n\nIn February 1909, Geronimo was thrown from his horse while riding home, and had to lie in the cold all night before a friend found him extremely ill. He died of pneumonia on February 17, 1909, as a prisoner of the United States at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. On his deathbed, he confessed to his nephew that he regretted his decision to surrender. His last words were reported to be said to his nephew, \"I should have never surrendered. I should have fought until I was the last man alive.\" He was buried at Fort Sill, Oklahoma in the Apache Indian Prisoner of War Cemetery.\n\nSix members of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones, including Prescott Bush, served as Army volunteers at Fort Sill during World War I.\n\nIn 1986, former San Carlos Apache chairman Ned Anderson received an anonymous letter with a photograph and a copy of a log book claiming that Skull and Bones held the skull. He met with Skull and Bones officials about the rumor; the group's attorney, Endicott P. Davidson, denied that the group held the skull and said that the 1918 ledger saying otherwise was a hoax. The group offered Anderson a glass case containing what appeared to be the skull of a child, but Anderson refused it. In 2006, Marc Wortman discovered a 1918 letter from Skull & Bones member Winter Mead to F. Trubee Davison that claimed the theft:\n\nThe second \"tomb\" references the building of Yale University's Skull and Bones society. But Mead was not at Fort Sill, and Cameron University history professor David H. Miller notes that Geronimo's grave was unmarked at the time. The revelation led Harlyn Geronimo of Mescalero, New Mexico, to write to President George W. Bush (the grandson of Prescott Bush) requesting his help in returning the remains:\n\nIn 2009, Ramsey Clark filed a lawsuit on behalf of people claiming descent from Geronimo, against several parties, including Robert Gates and Skull and Bones, asking for the return of Geronimo's bones. An article in \"The New York Times\" states that Clark \"acknowledged he had no hard proof that the story was true.\" Investigators, including Bush family biographer Kitty Kelley and the pseudonymous Cecil Adams, say the story is untrue. A military spokesman from Fort Sill told Adams, \"There is no evidence to indicate the bones are anywhere but in the grave site.\" Jeff Houser, chairman of the Fort Sill Apache tribe of Oklahoma, calls the story a hoax.\n\nReportedly inspired by the film \"Geronimo\" (1939), US Army paratroopers testing the practice of parachuting from planes began a tradition of shouting, \"Geronimo!\", to show they have no fear of jumping out of an airplane. Other Native American-based traditions were also adopted in WWII, such as \"Mohawk\" haircuts, face paint, and sporting spears on their unit patches.\n\nThe United States military used the code name \"Geronimo\" for the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, but its use outraged some Native Americans. It was subsequently reported to be named or renamed \"Operation Neptunes Spear\".\n\nHarlyn Geronimo, Geronimo's great-grandson, said to the Senate Commission on Indian Affairs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hence, the marriage between Selim I and Hafsa Sultan was the last marriage between an Ottoman sultan and a member of a neighboring Muslim royal family. During the period between her son's enthronement in 1520 and her death in 1534, she was one of the most influential persons in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe traditional view of Hafsa Sultan's origins is that she was the daughter of Meñli I Giray, the khan of the Crimean Tatars. Several notable historians have supported this view, including Brian Glyn Williams, Reşat Kasaba claims that the marriage between Selim I and Hafsa Sultan was the \"last marriage between an Ottoman sultan and a member of a neighboring Muslim royal family\". Esin Atıl, however, states that whilst some historians state that she was the daughter of Giray, others have mentioned that the Crimean princess named \"Ayse\" was another one of Selim I's wives and that \"Hafsa\" may have been of slave origin. Ilya Zaytsev claims that \"Ayshe (daughter of Mengli-Giray I)\" first married Şehzade Mehmed, the governor of Kefe, and that she later married his brother Selim I; consequently, her marriage into the Ottoman dynasty was one of two noted instances of wedlock between the Girays and Ottomans (the other being the marriage between Selim I's daughter to Saadet-Giray). Alan Fisher, Leslie Peirce, and Feridun Emecen all agree that Hafsa was of slave origin and not the daughter of the Crimean Khan.\n\nHaving resided in the city of Manisa in western Turkey with her son, who administered the surrounding region between 1513 and 1520, the town being one of the traditional residences for Ottoman crown princes (şehzade) in apprenticeship for future power, Hafsa Sultan is the initiator of the Manisa's \"Mesir Festival\", a local tradition still continued today. She also had a large complex built in the city consisting of a mosque, a primary school, a college and a hospice.\n\nShe was also the first Ottoman imperial women who held title \"sultan\" after her given name, replacing title \"hatun\". This usage reflected the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as \"family prerogative\". Consequently, the title valide hatun (title for living mother of the reigning Ottoman sultan before 16th century) also turned into valide sultan, made Hafsa the first valide sultan. Her period signalled the shifting status of the sultan's mother and her increased share in power.\nAfter the birth of her son Suleiman, born on 6 November 1494 in Trabzon, she gave birth to four daughters: Hatice, Fatma, Beyhan and Hafsa.\n\nShe was the most powerful woman of the Ottoman Empire during her son's reign.\n\nHafsa Sultan died in March 1534 and was buried near her husband in a mausoleum behind the qiblah wall of Yavuz Selim Mosque, in Fatih, Istanbul. The mausoleum was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 1884, a reconstruction effort started in the 1900s (decade) having been left discontinued, and her tomb today is much simpler than it was built originally.\n\n"}

His father was a weaver of Jewish origin. He received his education at the Realschule in Vienna. Early on, he was an actor in at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Only 21 years old he became manager of the failed Bremer Stadttheater. His success in rescuing the theater not only moved the Senate of the city to pass a resolution thanking him, but also brought him to the attention of Adolf Neuendorff, who was the manager of the Germania Theatre in New York. On invitation of Neuendorff Conried moved in 1878 to New York City, where he became chief stage manager of the Germania Theatre. In 1881 he moved to the Thalia Theatre as artistic manager and in 1882 he became artistic manager of the New York Concert Company.\n\nIn 1893 he assumed the management of the Irving Place Theatre. In 1903, he succeeded Maurice Grau as director of the Metropolitan Opera until 1908. His first season at the Met was notable through the first production of \"Parsifal\" outside of Bayreuth, against the wishes of Cosima Wagner, who went to court but failed in her attempt to forbid the production. By December 31, 1913, when the copyright of \"Parsifal\" expired, the work had been represented 43 times at the Metropolitan Opera. Enrico Caruso, who until then had refused all offers to come to America, was persuaded by Conried to come to New York and sing at the Met. Soon after he had become director of the Metropolitan Opera, he conceived the New Theatre.\n\nOn May 1, 1908 he retired from the Metropolitan Opera House due to his poor health. Immediately afterwards he voyaged to Europe. He died on April 27, 1909 in the Hotel Meranerhof in the city of Meran from an apoplectic stroke in the presence of his wife and sister.\n\n"}

He is considered the world's best-selling wine writer. His 1964 tasting of a bottle of 1540 \"Steinwein\" from the German vineyard Würzburger Stein is considered to potentially be one of the oldest wines to have ever been tasted.\n\nHe was born the son of Guy F. Johnson and Grace Kittel, educated at Rugby School and read English at King's College, Cambridge.\n\nJohnson became a member of the Cambridge University Wine and Food Society while an undergraduate in the 1950s. On describing his introduction to wine-tasting Johnson has recalled:\nJohnson has been writing about wine since 1960, was taken on as a feature writer for Condé Nast Publications upon graduation, and started work on \"Vogue\" and \"House & Garden \", becoming in 1962 editor of \"Wine & Food\" and in the same year wine correspondent of \"The Sunday Times\", of which in 1967 he became Travel Editor. From 1968 to 1970 he edited \"Queen\" magazine in succession to Jocelyn Stevens.\n\nHe has published a wide array of books, starting with the publication of \"Wine\" in 1966. \"The World Atlas of Wine\" (1971) was considered the first serious attempt to map the world's wine regions, described by the director of the INAO as \"a major event in wine literature\".\n\nSince its launch in 1973 Johnson has been President of the Sunday Times Wine Club, part of Laithwaites, now the world's largest mail-order wine merchant. From 1986 to 2001 he was a Director of the Bordeaux First Growth Chateau Latour and in 1990 was a co-founder of the Royal Tokaji Wine Company in an attempt to rebuild the foundering Tokaji industry after Communism. In 1986 he started the Hugh Johnson Collection, which sold (until 2010) wine glasses and other artefacts related to wine, mainly in the Far East, with a shop in St James's Street, London.\n\nHis book \"Vintage: The Story of Wine\", an authoritative 500-page compendium, was first published in 1989 by Octopus, and re-edited in 2004 as a fully illustrated edition published by Mitchell Beazley.

{"id": "14799138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14799138", "title": "Igor Kufayev", "text": "Igor Kufayev\n\nIgor Anvar Kufayev (; born January 5, 1966), is a Russian British artist, yogi and spiritual teacher. Also known as 'Vamadeva' (Sanskrit), which means \"preserving aspect of Shiva in his peaceful, graceful and poetic form\".\n\nIgor Kufayev was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In his childhood he had many spiritual experiences associated with awakening of Kundalini. Classically trained in art from an early age he attended a private studio of a martial artist and painter Shamil Rakhimov, a place of underground meetings between liberal thinkers, poets and painters. The violent death of his mentor lead to young Igor's decision to become an artist. Kufayev received his formal education at the Art College in Tashkent, and after two years of compulsory military service, resumed his studies at the Theater and Art Institute, at the department of Mural painting. In 1988 he was accepted as a student of a second year to the Academy of Arts (now Imperial Academy of Arts) in St Petersburg, Russia. Independently of his official program, he studied and painted directly from the masterpieces of western art, in the Hermitage Museum.\n\nIn 1990 Kufayev left Russia and moved to Warsaw, Poland. This was a formative time. An encounter with the art critic Andrzej Matynia lead to Kufayev's first solo exhibition, \"Eternal Compromise\" at the Monetti Gallery, Warsaw. Igor was invited to take part in \"The Meeting of Sacred Images\", at the National Museum of Ethnography in Warsaw, with his triptych \"Compromise\", alongside such Icons as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa and Mexican Our Lady of Guadalupe as well as modern masters as Christian Boltanski.\n\nHe moved to London in August 1991, the same year his six year old daughter from his first marriage died in a road accident. He remained in a prolonged period of grief unable to paint until he was able to come to terms with the personal tragedy and embarked on the series of dramatic paintings. The turning point came in 1994, on the wake of the one-man exhibition, entitled \"Burnt Earth\" and dedicated to the memory of his daughter Laura, he put his name on the map of London's art scene as one of the most promising young painters. In less than a decade Kufayev managed to establish himself as a successful artist, and opened his own studio in London where he held private views of his work annually. The \"Zauber\" tondo was created in response to the commission Igor Kufayev received from Elton John AIDS Foundation, which was to accompany the performance of Mozart's opera \"Die Zauberflote\" at Christie's head-quarters at St James's in London, in the autumn of 1995. A few months later, in January 1996 he was granted British Citizenship.\n\nThe following series of four tondos under the same title, \"Zauber\" was an achievement which took two years to complete (1995–1997).\n\nKufayev traveled widely visiting major art-fairs around Europe, as well as painting in France and Italy. Despite his unquestionable success he was deeply disillusioned about the state of art and all its prevalent trends.\n\nAn early interest towards spirituality lead to his practice of Yoga with initiation in 1996 to Transcendental Meditation, founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He immerses himself in the study of diverse spiritual traditions with special emphasis on Indian Philosophy, Sufi and Zen. At the age of thirty six Igor had undergone a radical transformation of consciousness which subsequently blossomed into spontaneous unfoldment of Grace.\n\nHe abandoned his art career and for the next five years he continued long hours of meditation, integrating expanded state of awareness throughout his daily activities. During that time he discovered the teachings of Swami Muktananda which led him to the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism. Its 'transcendental physicalism' appealed to his down to earth, creative sensibility, unique to that tradition's doctrine of \"Spanda\" (Sanskrit: \"throb, vibration\") which had been verified by direct experience, in \"perceiving the World as a Throb of Pure Consciousness in the Heart of his own\".\n\nIn October 2006, in an interview with Seva Novgorodsev for the BBC Russian Service, Kufayev talked about his years as an artist and the decision to leave painting.\n\nSince 2002 Kufayev has been sharing his insights into the nature of Being. Despite many requests, he declined to place himself in the role of a teacher until he made the conscious decision to give his full time to teaching in February 2008. Since 2012 he has offered online webinars and in-person gatherings and retreats worldwide. Many of his video-podcasts and recorded gatherings are freely available on his YouTube channel.\n\nAlthough his initial spiritual training occurred in the Transcendental Meditation program, Igor now teaches mainly using the methodologies of Tantric Kashmir Shaivism, stating that the doctrines of Kashmir Shaivism most closely match his direct experience of spiritual transformation and the nature of reality. However, Igor has studied widely, and draws from many other traditions such as Sufi and Zen. He remains elusive to categorization, maintaining that:\n\nIgor often refers to his teaching as “The Path of the Heart,” and explains that it is a non-intellectual and direct cognition of the essence of one’s reality — one which transcends any tradition, because by definition it cannot be contained by a set of doctrines. Here, knowledge is not mental or intellectual, nor spoken of in terms of acquisition; it is simple direct knowingness itself — beyond concepts and precepts, understanding, and language. Igor explains this:\n\nCentral to Igor's teaching methodology is the transmission of spiritual energy, which occurs primarily during in-person events. He has commented that \"the real work happens at the immersions — the real work happens in these specifically created containers.\" Participants at his immersions commonly experience spontaneous, involuntary kriyas, in the form of asanas, pranayama, glossolalia, and vocal harmonizing. One of the unusual but constant features of Igor's live events is spontaneous vocalization and overtoning by the participants.\n\nIgor states that these phenomena are both a result of release of stress, as well as the \"Song of the Goddess\" — literally a manifestation of Shakti through a group of people in meditative trance.\n\nParticipants at Igor's retreats have reported experiencing profound states of expansion, higher states of consciousness, permanent relief from depression.\n\nIgor emphasizes the psycho-physiological aspects of the awakening process, stressing the importance of the physical transformation of the nervous system. He states that the physiology acts as a support for individual consciousness to mature into what is often termed as \"enlightenment\". He also stresses the necessity of sitting meditation in spiritual practice, stating that while other methodologies may give peak experiences, it is only in sitting meditation that integration takes place, which is required for a permanent shift in consciousness.\n\nIn 2014, Igor consecrated the Flowing Wakefulness Fellowship, with a stated mission to serve \"as a platform for revealing and realizing possibilities for a Consciousness-based culture, aimed at the recognition, development and actualization of the fullest potential present in human birth.\"\n\nIn September 2013 Igor Kufayev was interviewed for the 'Conscious TV' (London based Channel), where he shared his views on the subtleties of awakening process based on biographical events of his life, and addressed the unifying complexity of self-realization and integration of higher states of awareness as seen from the biological perspective of human consciousness.\n\nIgor now lives with his partner and their two small children in Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. In 2006 he moved back to Uzbekistan and lived in his birth city of Tashkent for almost four years. Between April 2011 and December 2012 he and his family were traveling in Central America with the base in Costa Rica, followed by spending nine months, until September 2013, in Mallorca\nKufayev has a grown-up daughter from a previous relationship who lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\n"}

At the time of his death, he was the immediate past chairman of the Uganda Land Commission. He previously served as a cabinet minister in several ministries in the Cabinet of Uganda. \n\nFrom 1962 until 1993, Mayanja Nkanki served as the \"Katikkiro\" (prime minister) under Sir Edward Muteesa II, the Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned from 1939 until 1969. In 1993, when the Kingdom of Buganda was re-instated, he was instrumental in the installation of the present monarch, Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II.\n\nHe was born on 22 August 1932 to Isaya Sibakyalwayo and Yozefina Nantale in what was Masaka District at that time, but today is part of Kalungu District to parents, Isaya Sibakyalwayo and Yozefina Nantale. He attended Kaabungo Masaka Primary School from 1937 to 1946, Kako Junior School from 1944 to 1946, and King's College Budo for secondary school from 1947 to 1949. In 1950, he joined Makerere University, then a constituent college of the University of London, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1953.\n\nIn 1954, he was admitted to Keble College, Oxford on scholarship, graduating with a Master of Arts in politics, philosophy and economics in 1960. He also became certified as a barrister following his training at Lincoln's Inn of Courts in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile at Oxford, Nkangi studied law at Lincoln’s Inn of Courts in London, then returned to Uganda in 1960 where he set up his law practice. He also joined pre-independence Ugandan politics. He formed a political party called the \"United Party\"; later called the \"United National Party\" (UNP). In 1962, he abandoned the UNP and joined the Kabaka Yekka (KY) political party. He was elected to represent Masaka East Constituency in the Ugandan Parliament, in May 1962. Following independence on 9 October 1962, Nkangi served as minister without portfolio in the ministry of economic affairs. Then as the commerce and industry minister. On 17 August 1964, Nkangi, at age 33 years and a bachelor, was elected Buganda’s katikkiro by the Lukiiko in a landslide. Looking back, Nkangi says his humble beginnings must have marketed him. \"The Kabaka did not know me personally.\n\nTrouble started in early 1966. On 15 April 1966, the 1962 Uganda constitution was abrogated during a parliamentary session in which Milton Obote, the then prime mister, was surrounded by Uganda Army troops. The Buganda lukiiko (parliament) passed a resolution to eject the central government from Buganda; essentially declaring Buganda's secession from Uganda. In response, Obote ordered Idi Amin, the army commander at the time to attack the Kabaka's palace at Mengo. The assault came on 24 May 1966. Both Muteesa and Nkangi fled to the United Kingdom. Nkangi went via Nairobi, in Kenya. In 1967, Obote abolished the cultural kingdoms and put a new constitution in place. \n\nWhile in exile, he was able to find work as a research fellow at Lancaster University. Also while there, he was able to witness the Kabaka's written desire to have his son Ronald Muwenda Mutebi succeed the Buganda throne, when that time came. After Muteesa passed away on 21 November 1969, Mayanja Nkangi, in his capacity as Katikkiro, proclaimed the death, as is the custom. He returned to Uganda in April to arrange and partly oversee the deceased king's funereal in April 1971. \n\nFollowing the removal of the Obote I regime in 1971, Nkangi returned to Uganda and re-opened his law practice. Although Amin spied on him, he generally left him alone, once he learnt that Nkangi had no plans to undermine his government. Following the overthrow of Idi Amin in 1979, Nkonge formed the Conservative Party (Uganda).\n\nWhen the Obote II government (1980 - 1985) was overthrown by the military junta led by Tito Okello Lutwa, Nkangi was appointed minister of labour, serving in that capacity from August 1985 until January 1986.\n\nUnder the National Resistance Movement administration, led by Yoweri Museveni, Nkangi served as minister of education, minister of planning, minister of finance and ministry of justice. His tenure in Museveni's cabinet lasted from 1986 until 2001. After his retirement from cabinet, he was appointed chairman of the Uganda Land Commission, serving in that capacity from 2002 until 2012.\n\nIn 2010, he was appointed Chairman of the Uganda Land Commission, which he held from 2010 until 2013. In later life, he wrote an autobiography, titled \"Out of Empire into Servitude.\"\n\nDuring his tenure as the minister of education (1986 - 1989), he oversaw the creation of Kyambogo University. While he served as the minister of planning (1989 - 1982), he oversaw the creation of the Uganda Investment Authority.\n\nHe died on 6 March 2017 at Nakasero Hospital where he had been hospitalized since February 2017, at the age of 85. The cause of death was reported to be pneumonia. He was buried on 10 March 2017 at his ancestral home in Kalungu District. Among the mourners were Uganda's vice president Edward Ssekandi, the Katikkiro of Buganda Charles Peter Mayiga, members of parliament and religious leaders.\n\n"}

She founded the first Indian and Métis Friendship Centre in Canada to assist indigenous people who had relocated to urban areas with adjustments to their new communities. She edited the native newspaper \"The Prairie Call\", bringing cultural events as well as socio-economic challenges into discussion for native communities. She was the only woman on the Temporary Committee of the National Indian Council, which would later become the Assembly of First Nations, and would become the secretary-treasurer of the organization when it was formalized. She was one of the women involved in the launch of the Kinew Housing project, to bring affordable, safe housing to indigenous urban dwellers and a founder of the Indigenous Bar Association of Canada. She has received the Order of Canada as well as many other honors for her activism on behalf of indigenous people. She was a founder and currently serves on the National Indigenous Council of Elders.\n\nMarion Ironquill was born in 1936 on the Peepeekisis First Nation Reserve near Balcarres, Saskatchewan, Canada to Helen and Joseph Ironquill. Her mother was of Cree heritage and her father was Ojibwa. She grew up on her family's farm and attended school ten months of the year at a residential school twelve miles away because there was no school available locally. She graduated from Birtle Collegeate, a parochial institution which left her with a feeling that she did not belong in either the aboriginal world or the non-native world. At the age of 16, she enrolled in pre-med courses at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. After two years of science studies in 1954, Ironquill left school to marry Ronald Hector Meadmore, who would go on to earn fame in the Canadian Football League. The couple had three children, Glen, Neil and Jim. For nearly twenty years, Meadmore raised her children and participated in social projects.\n\nDuring this time, in 1959 Meadmore helped establish a gathering place where urban native people around Winnipeg could gather, called the Indian and Métis Friendship Centre (IMFC). The center was the first one in Canada and has since been replicated dozens of times. Meadmore worked full-time as a liaison at the IMFC. As the center grew, it established a newspaper, \"The Prairie Call\", which was organized in 1961 as a means of featuring aboriginal writings and notifications of activities. Meadmore, who was the editor of \"The Prairie Call\" recognized that it was a means to build a community concerned with the legal and socio-economic issues facing indigenous people and used the paper to discuss realities of urban life as well as human rights issues. Simultaneously, she joined with Telford Adams, A.H. Brass, Joe Keeper, David Knight and George Manuel to form the Temporary Committee of the National Indian Council, which would later become the Assembly of First Nations. The goal was to create a national body committed to both advancement of native peoples and preservation of their identity, where native people could come up with their own solutions to the problems facing their cultures. When the organization's board was formalized the following year, Meadmore was elected secretary-treasurer.\n\nIn 1970, Meadmore was appointed to the National Council of Welfare. That same year, after witnessing the struggles a friend had in securing safe housing on a limited budget, Meadmore helped launch the Kinew Housing project, under the sponsorship of the IMFC. She and Mary Guilbault were instrumental in both founding the Kinew project and advocating for a social housing policy. Seeking the cooperation of private funding and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), they secured houses at favorable prices. Renovations were completed by indigenous workers, to make the homes livable and safe, and they were then offered to Native Canadians at reasonable rates. Then counselors from IMFC met with tenants to give advice on a range of issues including housing concerns and tips to dealing with employers and the urban environment. Because the housing purchases required use of a lawyer, Meadmore began to think about returning to school, to better understand the legal impact on business and economic development programs.\n\nWhen Meadmore completed her law degree in 1977 at the University of Manitoba, she became the first Canadian indigenous woman lawyer. First working at Legal Aid Manitoba, practicing criminal and family law, Meadmore soon opened Winnipeg's first all-female law firm, which focused on corporate law. She was one of the founders of the Canadian Indian Lawyers Association, now known as the Indigenous Bar Association of Canada. In 1982, she left the active practice of law and began the Indian Business Development Group to encourage growth in native businesses.\n\nMeadmore was one of the founders of the National Indigenous Council of Elders (NICE), which strives to join First Nation elders from across Canada to develop economic programs which will enable Canada's indigenous people to operate without government funding. Because the tribes have trusts in the billions of dollars, and understand the needs of their own communities in a way that the government cannot, they are pushing to be able to manage their own funds and solve their own social problems.\n\nIn 1985, Meadmore was awarded membership in the Order of Canada. In 2010 she was honored with the title of \"Grandmother\" from the Ka Ni Kanichihk service organization, which hosts the annual Keeping the Fires Burning Aboriginal Awards to recognize women who serve as role models for younger indigenous women. In 2014, she was awarded an Indspire Awards laureate designation for law by the Indspire Foundation and the University of Manitoba granted a Lifetime Achievement Award to Meadmore in 2015.\n\n"}

In the mid-1990s, he began studying water in more detail.\n\nEmoto was President Emeritus of the International Water For Life Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City in the United States. In 1992, Emoto became a Doctor of Alternative Medicine at the Open International University for Alternative Medicine in India, a correspondence school which it is alleged requires no coursework.\n\nEmoto said that water was a \"blueprint for our reality\" and that emotional \"energies\" and \"vibrations\" could change the physical structure of water. Emoto's water crystal experiments consisted of exposing water in glasses to different words, pictures, or music and then freezing and examining the aesthetic properties of the resulting crystals with microscopic photography. Emoto made the claim that water exposed to positive speech and thoughts would result in visually \"pleasing\" crystals being formed when that water was frozen and that negative intention would yield \"ugly\" frozen crystal formations.\n\nEmoto held that different water sources would produce different crystalline structures when frozen. For example, he held that a water sample from a mountain stream when frozen would show structures of beautifully shaped geometric design, but those structures would be distorted and randomly formed if the sample were taken from a polluted water source. Emoto held that these changes could be eliminated by exposing water to ultraviolet light or certain electromagnetic waves.\n\nIn 2008, Emoto published his findings in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, a peer reviewed scientific journal of the Society for Scientific Exploration. The work was conducted and authored by Masaru Emoto and Takashige Kizu of Emoto’s own IHM General Institute, along with Dean Radin and Nancy Lund of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, which is on Stephen Barrett's Quackwatch list of questionable organizations.\nIn the experiment, more than 1,900 of Emoto's followers focused feelings of gratitude toward water stored in bottles, which was then frozen and its crystalline formations inspected. The gratitude-focused crystals were rated slightly more \"beautiful\" than one set of control crystals and slightly less \"beautiful\" than the other controls. An objective comparison of the samples did not reveal any significant differences.\n\nCommentators have criticized Emoto for insufficient experimental controls and for not sharing enough details of his approach with the scientific community. William A. Tiller, another researcher featured in the documentary \"What The Bleep Do We Know?\", states that Emoto's experiments fall short of proof since they do not control for other factors in the supercooling of water. In addition, Emoto has been criticized for designing his experiments in ways that leave them prone to manipulation or human error influencing the findings. Biochemist and Director of Microscopy at University College Cork William Reville wrote, \"It is very unlikely that there is any reality behind Emoto's claims.\" Reville noted the lack of scientific publication and pointed out that anyone who could demonstrate such a phenomenon would become immediately famous and probably wealthy.\n\nWriting about Emoto's ideas in the \"Skeptical Inquirer\", physician Harriet A. Hall concluded that it was \"hard to see how anyone could mistake it for science\". Commenting on Emoto's ideas about clearing water polluted by algae, biologist Tyler Volk stated, \"What he is saying has nothing to do with science as I know it.\" Stephen Kiesling wrote in \"Spirituality & Health Magazine\", \"Perhaps Emoto is an evangelist who values the message of his images more than the particulars of science; nevertheless, this spiritual teacher might focus his future practice less on gratitude and more on honesty.\"\n\nEmoto was personally invited to take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge by James Randi in 2003 and would have received US$1,000,000 if he had been able to reproduce the experiment under test conditions agreed to by both parties. He did not participate.\n\nEmoto's book \"The Hidden Messages in Water\" was a \"New York Times\" best seller. Commenting on the book making the list, literary critic Dwight Garner wrote in \"The New York Times Book Review\" that it was one of those \"head-scratchers\" that made him question the sanity of the reading public, describing the book as \"spectacularly eccentric.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" described Emoto's later work, \"The Shape of Love\", as \"mostly incoherent and unsatisfying\".\n\nEmoto's ideas appeared in the movies \"\" and \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

October 6, 1950 McKeesport, PA, USA) is a medical anthropologist and professor in Anthropology at The University of Connecticut and in Community Medicine at The University of Connecticut Health Center. He is a prolific writer and best known for his research on substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, syndemics, health disparities, and minority health.\n\nSinger studied anthropology at California State University, Northridge (Master of Arts, Anthropology,1975) and completed a PhD in Anthropology at the University of Utah in 1979.\n\nHe held a National Institute of Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Psychiatry, George Washington University (1979–80) and another at the University of Connecticut Medical School from 1982-3.\n\nHe was a researcher, rising to Associate Director, at the Hispanic Health Council in Hartford, Connecticut from 1982-2007, and moved to the University of Connecticut in 2007, becoming Professor in 2008.\n\nAs Director of the Center for Community Health Research at the Hispanic Health Council, he helped to develop the theoretical perspective within medical anthropology known as \"critical medical anthropology\". Dr. Singer also developed the public health concepts of \"syndemics\" and \"oppression illness\". Most recently, he has published a number of articles on \"pluralea\".\n\nThe first of these terms refers to the clustering of diseases in populations and the biological interaction of diseases in individual bodies. Moreover, the term syndemics also points to the determinant importance of social conditions in disease concentrations, interactions, and health consequences. In syndemics, the interaction of diseases or other adverse health conditions commonly arises because of adverse social conditions (e.g., poverty, exploitation, stigmatization, oppressive social relationships) that put socially devalued groups at heightened risk. The term oppression illness refers to the internalization of social discrimination and the health consequences of coming to accept one does not deserve to be healthy. The term pluralea refers to the adverse intersection of environmental crises and their health effects.\n\nIn his work on alcohol and drug use, Singer explains that all drugs are commodities and draws attention to social constructions of legitimate or legal and illegitimate or illegal drugs. In his book Drugging the Poor: Legal and Illegal Drugs and Social Inequality, Singer notes that all drugs are forms of self-medicating, and that distinctions of legal or illegal serve to reinforce social hierarchies and inequalities. Furthermore, Singer argues that drug use among the poor is a type of self-medicating in response to the pressures of being poor. Responding to ways illegal drug users are vilified, Singer argues that by using language of blame to describe drug users as responsible for deteriorating urban centers, “attention is diverted from the role of class inequality as a source of social misery.”\n\nDr. Singer has been the Principal Investigator on a series of U.S. Federal and foundation funded drinking, drug use, and AIDS prevention grants since 1984. Recent grants include:\n\nAdditionally, he is co-editor with Pamela Erickson of the book series \"'Advances in Critical Medical Anthropology\" with Left Coast Press.\n\n Solon T. Kimball Award for Public and Applied Anthropology from the American Anthropological Association. (2010)\n\nDr. Singer is the dedicated father of two children, Jacob Hillis Singer and Elyse Ona Singer.

He has been an unsuccessful candidate in several Florida state legislature elections, and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2016 election. He was also the Reform Party's nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election.\n\nSteinberg has been practicing law for over 30 years, and his firm, Michael Steinberg & Associates, provides legal services to clients in social security, veteran's compensation, long-term disability insurance, and state disability matters. The \"Tampa Bay Times\" cited him saying that the aging population of Tampa Bay and the area's declining economy were the cause of an increase in local legal claims. Between 2008 and 2009, the 21 percent increase in social security disability legal claims in Tampa Bay broke the nationwide record.\n\nIn 2014, his wife Miriam ran for a Florida state legislature seat in District 64, where he had run unsuccessfully in 2002.\n\nSteinberg received his bachelor's degree in economics and a law degree from the University of Florida. In addition to his career as an attorney practicing social security law, he has served on the Florida Bar Association's military law subcommittee.\n\nIn 2002, Steinberg ran for election for the Florida state legislature in District 64; his candidacy was endorsed by the \"St. Petersburg Times.\" Two months after losing the election, Steinberg filed a lawsuit against the state Republican party for push polling against him in the election. The Florida Republican Party hired Tarrance Group, a Virginia-based polling company, to survey voters across the state. Towson Fraser, spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida at the time, denied that his party used push polls.\n\nSteinberg ran again for this seat in 2010, and lost.\n\nIn 2006, Steinberg received 1,334 votes (3.4% of the popular vote) in the Democratic primary race for Florida's 11th congressional district.\n\nWhen his wife, Miriam Steinberg, was running for office in 2014, he filed a lawsuit to disqualify a competing write-in candidate. Although the lawsuit was successful, the election was ruled invalid, and the seat was vacant until a special election could be held. As a result, J. W. Grant, who was out of office for a period, was automatically the winner of the election despite having reached his term limit. Miriam lost the election to Grant by a 59:40 margin.\n\nIt was later ruled that write-in candidate should not have been disqualified, and subsequently, the election was ruled unconstitutional and the Florida legislature voted not to accept the result. Miriam then failed to file new fees to run again against Grant in a special election; although Michael filed a claim against the Florida Election Commission disputing the fee requirement. This resulted in Grant's only opponent being a write-in candidate. No write-in candidate has ever won an election in Florida.\n\nGrant was about to be running up against a Florida term limit law, but because the regular election was ruled invalid the seat was vacant for most of 2015 legislative session.\n\nSteinberg filed papers with the U.S. Federal Election Commission in November 2013 to run for President in the 2016 election as a Democrat.\n\nAfter failing to gain traction for his presidential bid, he was then nominated by the Reform Party of the United States as the vice-presidential running mate of 2016 Reform presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente.\n\nSteinberg and his wife Miriam live in Florida.

Bhavsar's paintings appear in more than 800 private and public collections, including the collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, Australia, the Library of Congress, NYU's Grey Art Gallery, and the Australian National Gallery. In addition, his works have been purchased and displayed by corporations such as the American Express Company, AT&T, Chase Manhattan Bank, and NBC. Bhavsar and his works have been the subject of books, including: \"Natvar Bhavsar: The Sound of Color,\" (Robert C. Morgan, 2002) and \"Natvar Bhavsar: Painting and the Reality of Color,\" (Irving Sandler, 1999).\n\nBhavsar is a Gujarati. Born 1934 in village Gothava, near Visnagar in Gujarat, India to a wealthy family, he studied at the Seth CN College of Fine Arts in Ahmedabad. He also graduated in English literature from Gujarat University. Bhavsar earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Design in 1965, and received a Rockefeller grant.\n\nBhavsar attained prominence as an artist in India by age 19, working primarily in the Cubist vein. After moving to New York City, he became influenced by the freedom of abstract painting. His style evolved into abstract expressionism and color field painting, and his works often feature a hazy object (absent of direct lines or geometric shapes) in the center of a solid canvas, that projects an astral-like mass of color.\n\nEmploying some techniques from the Indian tradition of sand painting, Bhavsar paints in an improvisational manner, \"soaking the canvas with acrylic-based liquid binders that absorb and hold the fine pigment powder. He applies the base using a sifting technique with a screen, during which layers of fine, concentrated pigment are sprinkled and drizzled over the canvas (or paper), which is laid out on the floor so that the artist can walk around the painting and work on it from all sides.\" \n\nBhavsar primarily shows his work at the Sundaram Tagore Gallery in New York and the ACP Viviane Ehrli Gallery in Zurich, Switzerland, along with Pundole Art Gallery in Bombay, India. He has been exhibiting his works in one-man shows since 1970. In 2007, the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University sponsored an exhibition of about 50 of Bhavsar’s works. It was the first United States university to hold a one-man show of a South Asian artist.\n\nEarlier in his career, Bhavsar was a John D. Rockefeller III Fund Fellow (1965 –1966), a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (1975 – 1976), and an Instructor of Art at the University of Rhode Island (1967 – 1969). In 1980 and 1983, he participated in Executive Seminars at the Aspen Institute and, more recently, participated as a Cultural Leader at the World Economic Forums in Davos, Switzerland (2000) and New York (2002). Throughout his career, Bhavsar has associated with a number of acclaimed artists, most prominently, Mark Rothko (1903 – 1970) and Barnett Newman (1905 – 1970).\n\nBhasvar has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's artasiamerica digital archive. \n\nIn 2011, a documentary on his life and works, \"The Poetics of Color: Natvar Bhavsar, a Painter's Journey\" was made by Sundaram Tagore.\n\nBhavsar married American artist and photographer Janet Brosious Bhavsar in 1978, and they have twin sons. The Bhavsars met in art class in the early 1960s, and she drove him to New York City on his first visit in 1963 to look at Picasso paintings at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\n"}
{"id": "284356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=284356", "title": "Oscar Robertson", "text": "Oscar Robertson\n\nOscar Palmer Robertson (born November 24, 1938), nicknamed \"The Big O\", is an American retired professional basketball player who played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks. The , Robertson played point guard and was a 12-time All-Star, 11-time member of the All-NBA Team, and one-time winner of the MVP award in 14 professional seasons. In 1962, he became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season. In the 1970–71 NBA season, he was a key player on the team that brought the Bucks their only NBA title. His playing career, especially during high school and college, was plagued by racism.\n\nRobertson is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, having been inducted in 1980 for his individual career, and in 2010 as a member of the 1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team and president of the National Basketball Players Association. He also was voted one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. The United States Basketball Writers Association renamed their College Player of the Year Award the Oscar Robertson Trophy in his honor in 1998, and he was one of five people chosen to represent the inaugural National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame class in 2006. He was ranked as the 36th best American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN.\n\nRobertson was also an integral part of \"Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n\" of 1970. The landmark NBA antitrust suit, named after the then-president of the NBA Players' Association, led to an extensive reform of the league's strict free agency and draft rules and, subsequently, to higher salaries for all players.\n\nRobertson was born in poverty in Charlotte, Tennessee, and grew up in a segregated housing project in Indianapolis. In contrast to many other boys who preferred to play baseball, he was drawn to basketball because it was \"a poor kids' game\". Because his family could not afford to buy a basketball, he learned how to shoot by tossing tennis balls and rags bound with rubber bands into a peach basket behind his family's home. Robertson attended Crispus Attucks High School, an all-black high school.\n\nAt Crispus Attucks, Robertson was coached by Ray Crowe, whose emphasis on a fundamentally sound game had a positive effect on Robertson's style of play. As a sophomore in 1954, he starred on an Attucks team that lost in the semi-state finals (state quarterfinals) to eventual state champions Milan, whose story would later be the basis of the classic 1986 movie \"Hoosiers\". When Robertson was a junior, Crispus Attucks dominated its opposition, going 31–1 and winning the 1955 state championship, the first for any all-black school in the nation. The following year the team finished with a perfect 31–0 record and won a second straight Indiana state title, becoming the first team in Indiana to secure a perfect season and compiling a state-record 45 straight victories. The state championships were also the first ever by an Indianapolis team in the Hoosier tourney. After their championship game wins, the team was paraded through town in a regular tradition, but they were then taken to a park outside downtown to continue their celebration, unlike other teams. Robertson stated, \"[Officials] thought the blacks were going to tear the town up, and they thought the whites wouldn't like it.\" Robertson scored 24.0 points per game in his senior season and was named Indiana \"Mr. Basketball\" in 1956. After his graduation that year, Robertson enrolled at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nRobertson continued to excel while at the University of Cincinnati, recording an incredible scoring average of 33.8 points per game, the third highest in college history. In each of his three years, he won the national scoring title, was named an All-American, and was chosen College Player of the Year, while setting 14 NCAA and 19 school records.\n\nRobertson's stellar play led the Bearcats to a 79–9 overall record during his three varsity seasons, including two Final Four appearances. However, a championship eluded Robertson, something that would become a repeated occurrence until late in his professional career. When Robertson left college he was the all-time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall of Fame player Pete Maravich topped him in 1970. Robertson took Cincinnati to national prominence during his time there, but the university's greatest success in basketball took place immediately after his departure, when the team won national titles in 1961, 1962, and just missed a third title in 1963.\n\nHe continues to stand atop the Bearcats' record book. The many records he still holds include: points in one game, 62 (one of his six games of 50 points or more); career triple-doubles, 10; career rebounds per game, 15.2; and career points, 2,973.\n\nRobertson had many outstanding individual game performances, including 10 triple-doubles. His personal best might have been his line of 45 points, 23 rebounds and 10 assists vs. Indiana State in 1959.\n\nDespite his success on the court, Robertson's college career was soured by racism. In those days, southern university programs such as those of Kentucky, Duke, and North Carolina did not recruit black athletes, and road trips to segregated cities were especially difficult, with Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels. \"I'll never forgive them\", he told \"The Indianapolis Star\" years later. Decades after his college days, Robertson's stellar NCAA career was rewarded by the United States Basketball Writers Association when, in 1998, they renamed the trophy awarded to the NCAA Division I Player of the Year the Oscar Robertson Trophy. This honor brought the award full circle for Robertson since he had won the first two awards ever presented.\n\nAfter college, Robertson and Jerry West co-captained the U.S. basketball team at the 1960 Summer Olympics. The team, described as the greatest assemblage of amateur basketball talent ever, steamrollered the competition to win the gold medal. Robertson was a starting forward along with Purdue's Terry Dischinger, but played point guard as well. He was the co-leading scorer with fellow NBA legend Jerry Lucas, as the U.S. team won its nine games by a margin of 42.4 points. Ten of the twelve college players on the American squad later played in the NBA, including Robertson as well as future Hall-of-Famers West, Lucas, and Walt Bellamy.\n\nPrior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson made himself eligible for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, a far cry from his childhood days when he was too poor to afford a basketball. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division.\n\nIn the 1961–62 season, Robertson became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire season, with 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists. Robertson also set a then-NBA record for the most triple-doubles during the regular season with 41 triple-doubles; the record would stand for over half a century when, in 2016–17, Russell Westbrook recorded 42 and joined Robertson as the only other player to average a triple-double for an entire season. He broke the assists record by Bob Cousy, who had recorded 715 assists two seasons earlier, by logging 899. The Royals earned a playoff berth; however, they were eliminated in the first round by the Detroit Pistons. In the next season, Robertson further established himself as one of the greatest players of his generation, averaging 28.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 9.5 assists, narrowly missing out on another triple-double season. The Royals advanced to the Eastern Division Finals, but succumbed in a seven-game series against a Boston Celtics team led by Bill Russell.\n\nIn the 1963–64 season, the Royals achieved a 55–25 record, which put them second place in the Eastern Division. Under new coach Jack McMahon, Robertson flourished, and for the first time in his career, he had a decent supporting cast: second scoring option Jack Twyman was now supplemented by Jerry Lucas and Wayne Embry, and fellow guard Adrian Smith helped Robertson in the backcourt. Robertson led the NBA in free-throw percentage, scored a career-high 31.4 points per game, and averaged 9.9 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. The averages for his first five NBA seasons are a triple-double: 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists per game. He won the NBA MVP award and became the only player other than Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to win it from 1960 to 1968. Robertson also won his second All-Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points, grabbing 14 rebounds, and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory. In the postseason, the Royals defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, but then were dominated by the Celtics 4 games to 1.\n\nRobertson averaged a triple-double for his first five seasons in the NBA with the Royals, recording averages of 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists per game. From the 1964–65 season on, things began to turn sour for the franchise. Despite Robertson's stellar play, never failing to record averages of at least 24.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.1 assists in the six following seasons, the Royals were eliminated in the first round from 1965 to 1967, then missed the playoffs from 1968 to 1970. In the 1969–70 season, the sixth disappointing season in a row, fan support was waning. To help attract the public, 41-year-old head coach Bob Cousy made a short comeback as a player. For seven games, the former Celtics point guard partnered with Robertson in the Royals' backcourt, but they missed the playoffs.\n\nPrior to the 1970–71 season, the Royals stunned the basketball world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk. No reasons were officially given, but many pundits suspected head coach Bob Cousy was jealous of all the attention Robertson was getting. Robertson himself said: \"I think he was wrong and I will never forget it.\" The relationship between Oscar and the Royals had soured to the point that Cincinnati had also approached the Lakers and Knicks about deals involving their star player (the Knicks players who were discussed in those scenarios are unknown, but Los Angeles stated publicly that the Royals asked about Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain, with the Lakers saying they would not consider trading either star).\n\nHowever, the trade proved highly beneficial for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66–16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12–2 record in the playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For the first time in his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made not on a basketball court, but rather in a court of law. It was the year of the landmark \"Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n\", an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.\n\nOn the hardwood, the veteran Robertson still proved he was a valuable player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson had the chance to end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nRobertson was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nAfter he retired as an active player, Robertson stayed involved in efforts to improve living conditions in his native Indianapolis, especially concerning fellow African-Americans. In addition, he worked as a color commentator with Brent Musburger on games televised by CBS during the 1974–75 NBA season. His trademark expression was \"Oh, Brent, did you see that!\" in reaction to flashy or spectacular situations such as fast breaks, slam dunks, player collisions, etc.\n\nAfter his retirement, the Kansas City Kings (the Royals moved there while Robertson was with the Bucks) retired his #14; the retirement continues to be honored by the Kings in their current home of Sacramento. The Bucks also retired the #1 he wore in Milwaukee.\n\nIn 1994, a nine-foot bronze statue of Robertson was erected outside the Fifth Third Arena at Shoemaker Center, the current home of Cincinnati Bearcats basketball. Robertson attends many of the games there, viewing the Bearcats from a chair at courtside. In 2006, the statue was relocated to the entrance of the Richard E. Lindner Athletics Center at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nStarting in 2000, Robertson served as a director for Countrywide Financial Corporation, until the company's sale to Bank of America in 2008.\n\nAfter many years out of the spotlight, Robertson was recognized on November 17, 2006 for his impact on college basketball when he was chosen to be a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five people, along with John Wooden, Bill Russell, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class.\n\nIn July 2004, Robertson was named interim head coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team for approximately a month while head coach Bob Huggins served a suspension stemming from a drunk-driving conviction.\n\nIn January 2011, Robertson joined a class action lawsuit against the NCAA, challenging the organization's use of the images of its former student athletes.\n\nIn 2015, Robertson was among a group of investors who placed a marijuana legalization initiative on the Ohio ballot. The initiative sought exclusive grow rights for the group members while prohibiting all other cultivation except small amounts for personal use. Robertson appeared in a television advertisement advocating for passage of the initiative, but it was ultimately defeated.\n\nRobertson is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history, a triple threat who could score inside, outside and also was a stellar playmaker. His rookie scoring average of 30.5 points per game is the third highest of any rookie in NBA history, and Robertson averaged more than 30 points per game in six of his first seven seasons. Only three other players in the NBA have had more 30+ point per game seasons in their career. Robertson was the first player to average more than 10 assists per game, doing so at a time when the criteria for assists were more stringent than today. Furthermore, Robertson is the first guard in NBA history to ever average more than 10 rebounds per game, doing so three times. It was a feat that would not be repeated until Russell Westbrook managed to achieve it during the 2016–17 season. In addition to his 1964 regular season MVP award, Robertson won three All-Star Game MVPs in his career (in 1961, 1964, and 1969). He ended his career with 26,710 points (25.7 per game, ninth-highest all time), 9,887 assists (9.5 per game) and 7,804 rebounds (7.5 per game). He led the league in assists six times, and at the time of his retirement, he was the NBA's all-time leader in career assists and free throws made, and was the second all-time leading scorer behind Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nRobertson also set yardsticks in versatility. If his first five NBA seasons are strung together, Robertson averaged a triple-double over those, averaging 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists. For his career, Robertson had 181 triple-doubles, a record that has never been approached. These numbers are even more astonishing if it is taken into account that the three-point shot, which benefits sharpshooting backcourt players, did not exist when he played. In 1967–68, Robertson also became the first of only two players in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring average and assists per game in the same season (also achieved by Nate Archibald). The official scoring and assist titles went to other players that season, however, because the NBA based the titles on point and assist totals (not averages) prior to the 1969–70 season. Robertson did, however, win a total of six NBA assist titles during his career. For his career, Robertson shot a high .485 field goal average and led the league in free-throw percentage twice—in the 1963–64 and 1967–68 seasons.\n\nRobertson is recognized by the NBA as the first legitimate \"big guard\", paving the way for other oversized backcourt players like Magic Johnson. Furthermore, he is also credited with having invented the head fake and the fadeaway jump shot, a shot which Michael Jordan later became famous for. For the Cincinnati Royals, now relocated and named the Sacramento Kings, he scored 22,009 points and 7,731 assists, and is all-time leader in both statistics for the combined Royals/Kings teams.\n\nRobertson was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 28, 1980. He received the \"Player of the Century\" award by the National Association of Basketball Coaches in 2000 and was ranked third on SLAM Magazine's Top 75 NBA Players in 2003, behind fellow NBA legends Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. Furthermore, in 2006, ESPN named Robertson the second greatest point guard of all time, praising him as the best post-up guard of all time and placing him only behind Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson. In 2017, it was announced that a life-sized bronze sculpture of Robertson would be featured alongside other Indiana sports stars at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis' Old National Bank Sports Legends Avenue of Champions, located in the museum's sports park opening in 2018.\n\nIn 1959, the Player of the Year Award was established to recognize the best college basketball player of the year by the United States Basketball Writers Association. Five nominees are presented and the individual with the most votes receives the award during the NCAA Final Four. In 1998, it was renamed the Oscar Robertson Trophy in honor of the player who won the first two awards because of his outstanding career and his continuing efforts to promote the game of basketball. In 2004, an 18\" bronze statue of Robertson was sculpted by world-renowned sculptor Harry Weber.\n\n77 times in the regular season\n\nRobertson is the son of Mazell and Bailey Robertson. He has two brothers, Bailey Jr. and Henry. He remembers a tough childhood, plagued by poverty and racism. When a biography was going to be written about him in the 1990s, Robertson joked that his life had been \"dull\", and that he had been \"married to the same woman for a long time\". In 1997, Robertson donated one of his kidneys to his daughter Tia, who suffered lupus-related kidney failure. He has been an honorary spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation ever since. In 2003, he published his own autobiography, \"The Big O: My Life, My Times, My Game\". Robertson also owns the chemical company Orchem, based in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nRegarding basketball, Robertson has stated that legendary Harlem Globetrotters players Marques Haynes and \"clown prince\" Goose Tatum were his idols. Now in his seventies, he is long retired from playing basketball, although he still follows it on TV and attends most home games for the University of Cincinnati, his alma mater. He now lists woodworking as his prime hobby. Robertson adds that he still could average a triple-double season in today's basketball, and that he is highly skeptical that anyone else could do it (it was later done by Russell Westbrook in the 2016–17 season). On June 9, 2007, Oscar received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Cincinnati for both his philanthropic and entrepreneurial efforts.\n\nIn August 2018, Robertson auctioned off his 1971 championship ring, Hall of Fame ring, and one of his Milwaukee Bucks game jerseys. Each item sold between $50,000 and $91,000.\n\n\n\n"}

He lives in Dorset, United Kingdom. He is best known for the work \"Daimonic Reality: A Field Guide to the Otherworld\" which deals with the paranormal in a similar way that Jacques Vallee, Allen Hynek and John Keel have done in the past.\n\nHarpur's topics deal with forteana and folklore, Daimonic Reality, traditions of Western religion—Alchemy, Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, and Depth Psychology.\n\nIn his book, \"Daimonic Reality\", Harpur argues that the human psyche extends beyond the confines of the physical human body, and that it may in fact be a part of our reality. He also notes that during most of human history, civilization has had another, \"shadow reality\" of folklore, except the current society which is strongly attached to the material. The following is a quotation from \"Daimonic Reality\":\nHitherto, I have taken \"soul\" to refer to two distinct, but unrelated, images. Firstly, soul is synonymous with the daimonic realm itself, the realm of Imagination, and is really an abbreviation for the collective \"Anima Mundi\", or World-Soul. Secondly, soul refers to whatever images the World-Soul itself uses to represent itself. Archetypally, this image is usually feminine and appears, for example, as a female daimon or goddess who, as Jung would say, \"personifies the collective unconscious.\" Now the third use of \"soul\" refers to the image by which we, as individuals, are represented in the World-Soul.\n\nHis follow-up \"The Philosophers' Secret Fire: A History of the Imagination\" Harpur traces the evolution of the Imagination in the west, and how ideas of reality have been shaped over time using this faculty. Starting with the shamanistic traditions on to modern science. He claims that not only myths, poetry, and religions rely on the imagination for new concepts of reality to be created, but even modern scientific methods and models.\n\nFiction\n\nNon-fiction\n\n"}

His characterization varies from story to story, though he is surprisingly prolific; he appears in a number of early stories, such as Chrétien de Troyes' works, and he turns up in all the cyclical versions. He gains a number of nicknames, including \"The Impetuous\" and \"le Desirous.\" Generally he is characterized as a virtuous but hot-tempered knight who fights fiercely and ragefully.\n\nAccording to the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Sagramore is the son of the King of Hungary and the daughter of the Eastern Roman Emperor; he is even an heir to the throne of Constantinople. His father dies while he was still young, and his mother accepts the proposal of King Brandegoris of Estangore in Britain. When he is fifteen, Sagramore travels to Britain to join them and to become one of King Arthur's knights. Upon arrival in Britain Sagramore engages Arthur's Saxon enemies, and receives aid from Arthur's nephew Gawain and his brothers. The group are subsequently knighted by Arthur.\n\nThe Lancelot-Grail describes him as a good knight, but quick to anger. When fighting, he would go into a frenzy not unlike the Irish hero Cúchulainn's warp spasm; when he came down, he would feel ill and hungry. As he was wont to do, Sir Kay gave him a nickname, \"Morte Jeune\" (dead youth), because he would sometimes go into epilepsy-like fits. The Lancelot-Grail recounts a number of his adventures, often centered around rescuing damsels, and mentions that he had a daughter by one of his paramours who was raised at Arthur's court by Guinevere. His half-sister, Brandegoris' beautiful daughter Claire, falls in love with Sir Bors and sleeps with him; their child is Elyan the White. He dies by Mordred's hand at the Battle of Camlann as one of Arthur's last remaining warriors.\n\nThe Post-Vulgate Cycle contains a different backstory for Sagramore. His family rescues Mordred from the sea (afraid of Merlin's prophecy that a child born on May Day will destroy him, Arthur sends children born that day out on a leaky boat) and raises him for the next several years as Sagramore's stepbrother.\n\nIn the Prose \"Tristan\", Sagramore is portrayed as a great friend to the Cornish knight Tristan, and even alerts the rest of the Round Table to his death.\n\nIn Sir Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", Sagramore's prowess varies from situation to situation; he usually serves to lose jousts to better knights, but at times he is a valiant fighter. He is also the subject of a fragmentary German romance, \"Segremors\", the surviving portions of which describe his journey to an island ruled by a fay and his undesired combat with his friend Gawain.\n\nIn the 16th-century Portuguese novel \"Triunfos de Sagramor\" (\"Triumphs of Sagramore\") or \"Memorial das Proezas da Segunda Távola Redonda\" (\"Memorial of the Deeds of the Second Round Table\"), by playwright Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcelos, Sagramore and legendary British king Constantine III are fused into a single person, \"Sagramor Constantino\", portrayed as the heir to Arthur, who forms a new Round Table to fight the Saxons and keep the glory of Arthurian Britain\n\nSagramore appears with some regularity in modern Arthurian literature and other fiction. \n\n"}

While they are most well known working together designing the \"Quest for Glory\" series, both are notable separately for designing games and (in the case of programmer Corey Cole) game engines independently of each other.\n\nThey formed Far Studio, which was the developer of \"Shannara\" and is now used for art and web development. They also formed a studio called Transolar Entertainment, which is the developer of the upcoming adventure RPG .\n\nCorey Cole is an American game designer, programmer, and writer who co-created various iterations of the SCI engine, co-designed the first four games in the \"Quest for Glory series\" with his wife, and designed and directed \"Castle of Dr. Brain\".\n\nCorey Cole is an avid \"Dungeons & Dragons\" fan, playing the game for 10 years before joining Sierra, and ultimately selling one role-playing module to Judges Guild. At that time he and his wife, Lori Cole published \"The Spell Book\", a role-playing game newsletter. They ran fantasy campaigns for years that had a unique rule system that later became the core of their \"Quest for Glory\" games.\n\nCorey Cole started his programming career at Sierra On-line in 1988, porting the SCI engine to Atari ST. He later co-programmed new iterations the SCI engine for use in many Sierra games during much of his tenure at Sierra.\n\nHe began his career as a game developer, alongside his wife Lori Ann Cole, with \"\" (which was later renamed \"Quest for Glory\") in 1989. He wasn't credited as co-developer of the game, but he was acknowledged as such by the games industry. \"Computer Gaming World\" recognized both Corey Cole and Lori Ann Cole as the game's designers when they awarded \"Hero's Quest\" the Adventure Game of the Year award. He and his wife were co-designers of the next three games in the \"Quest for Glory\" series as well.\n\nHe designed the puzzle adventure game \"Castle of Dr. Brain\", the first game in the \"Dr. Brain\" series, in 1991. The series is notable for being Sierra's only property to be licensed for use in television, as the Children's Television Workshop licensed it for use in their programming on December 9, 1993.\n\nAfter briefly leaving Sierra in 1996 due to issues with management, he returned to work on \"\", which was released in 1998. Corey did not take a development role on the game, but he did serve as a programmer. That same year, a photograph of his face was used as a head shot for a character in \"\". Corey's final role at Sierra was as a programmer on \"Hoyle Casino\". which was released in 2000.\n\n\nLori Ann Cole is an American game designer, director and writer who co-designed the first four \"Quest for Glory\" series with her husband, designed \"\", and designed and directed \"Mixed-Up Fairy Tales\". She is also a voice actor, voicing Queen Isabella in \"\".\n\nCole's varied background includes elementary education, film animation, and writing. She is a fanatic role-playing video game player who became involved in game designing because of her husband's involvement in Sierra On-line.\n\nLori Ann Cole co-designed the \"Quest for Glory\" series with her husband Corey Cole. She was the sole designer of the final chapter, \"Quest for Glory V\", although her husband was a programmer for that game.\n\nShe was also the designer of the second and final game in Sierra's \"Mixed-Up\" children's adventure game series, \"Mixed-Up Fairy Tales\". While at Sierra, she also was a voice actor, voicing Queen Isabella in the CD-ROM version of \"King's Quest V\".\n\nAfter briefly leaving Sierra in 1996 due to issues with management, she returned as the sole designer of \"Quest for Glory V\", which was released in 1998. That same year, a photograph of her face was used as a head shot for a character in \"\".\n\n\nSince Sierra didn't give the \"\" team the budget and time that the Coles felt the game needed, they decided to create games for other publishers. As a result, they formed FAR Productions and created \"Shannara\" for Legend Entertainment in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, Corey and Lori decided to make a game based on a book that she was co-writing that was never published called \"How to Be a Hero\". After losing the website named after the book after running it for three years, they decided to rename the idea \"School of Heroes\". They originally planned to make the game a text adventure, which Corey programmed using Inform, but they were not satisfied with the feel of the game and put it aside. At the same time, they decided to create a website to pre-promote the book. Corey programmed the interactive parts of the site, which would automise the original \"How to Be A Hero\" website's theme of allowing users to become \"students\" and complete \"assignments\". They planned to expand the site into a full interactive game, but those ideas never materialized.\n\nIn late 2011, the Coles decided to stop taking assignments at \"School of Heroes\" and instead make the idea into a game. On October 19, 2012, after the success from successful projects by fellow Sierra alumni and at the encouragement of fans, Lori Ann and Corey Cole launched a Kickstarter for 2D adventure RPG based on that idea, \"Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption\".

They also led France to six straight Davis Cup wins, 1927–32, in an era when Cup matches enjoyed a prestige similar to today's FIFA World Cup finals. At its creation in 1927, the tournament that would later be known as French Open's trophy was named the \"Coupe des Mousquetaires\" in honour of the quartet.\n\nThe Musketeers were:\n\nWhile Brugnon was primarily a doubles specialist, Borotra, Cochet, and Lacoste won many singles titles. Between them, they won three United States Championships at Forest Hills, six consecutive Wimbledon titles from 1924 through 1929, and 10 titles in 11 years at the French Championships, 1922 through 1932 (up to and including 1924, though, the tournament was only open to members of French tennis clubs, therefore wasn't a major tournament until 1925). From 1926 until 1930 a musketeer, Lacoste or Cochet, was ranked No. 1 in the world and in 1926 and 1927 all four musketeers were ranked in the top-10. The only player capable of challenging their dominance was the great American Bill Tilden (world number-one from 1920 until 1926, when Lacoste took over the position). The Musketeers were finally eclipsed by the arrival of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Jack Crawford on the international tennis scene in the first half of the 1930s.\n\nThe success of The Four Musketeers in winning the 1927 Davis Cup against the United States was directly responsible for the decision by the French Tennis Federation to build the Roland Garros venue at Porte d'Auteuil. The four men were national icons in France and all of them lived to be at least 83 years old, basking in glory for many years after their retirement from tennis. They were simultaneously inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1976.\nThe New Musketeers, (\"Nouveaux Mousquetaires\" or \"néo-Mousquetaires\") coined in \"L'Équipe\" and adopted by the French press, refers to the present-day squad of star players headlined by Gilles Simon, Richard Gasquet, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and Gaël Monfils. In 2008 France boasted four Top-20 players, a feat never before achieved since computer rankings were established in 1973. This configuration of the same four players in the Top-20 has been reproduced in mid-2011, in early 2012 and early 2016.\n\n\nSources\n"}
{"id": "3554687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3554687", "title": "Traiteur", "text": "Traiteur\n\nIn Louisiana, the term traiteur (sometimes spelled \"treateur\") describes a man or woman (a \"traiteuse\") who practises what is sometimes called faith healing. A traiteur is Native Creole healer or a traditional healer of the French-speaking Houma Tribe, whose primary method of treatment involves using the laying on of hands. An important part of Creole folk religion, the traiteur combines Catholic prayer and medicinal remedies. They are called to treat a variety of ailments, including: earaches, toothaches, warts, tumors, angina, and bleeding. In the past, they substituted for trained physicians in remote rural areas of Acadiana. Most traiteurs consider their healing abilities a gift from God, and therefore refuse to accept payment in exchange for their services.\n\nTraiteurism is a very old tradition that is dying out, and very few traiteurs now exist. Traditionally, the rituals of the traiteur are passed down to the opposite gender. So a male must pass it down to a female, and vice versa. The traiteur must be asked to perform the treatments and will rarely offer them outright unless the need is great, and they can not ask for a payment of any kind, although it is acceptable to accept gifts for treating a person. However gifts for a true traiteur are never required.\n\nIn Southern Louisiana, the co-existence of conventional medicine and traiteurs offers patients a range of resources for treating illness. Traiteurs and their patients do not view the two systems as conflicting. For example, if treating someone with a Coup-de-Soleil, or sunstroke, one would perform the ritual, then have the patient drink as much water as they could while lying down and then wiping the patient with a towel dampened in cool water. When a traiteur becomes ill, he goes to the doctor, yet he also employs week-long ceremonial candles (which are highly commercialized), Catholic Novenas (a Catholic rite involving nine days or weeks of recitation of a series of prayers), native traditional herbs, and perhaps a visit by another traiteur to get well. Some will use herbal remedies if they are known, the herbal remedies begin to cross over into voodoo being that both originated with the Creole people. Switching from one healing system to another is common among these practitioners and their patients, whose religious syncretism is matched by syncretism among medical systems. Another example of this fluidity is evident in the language with which the patients label their illnesses. Lousay A., a healer, is shown at his weekly home \"clinic\" hours one Saturday treating patients. One woman describes her condition as \"la mal angle\", Louisiana French for shingles, while another woman explains that she has \"herpes zoster,\" the medical term for the virus. Even in language, the traditional and the biomedical is heard to exist side by side without conflict.\n\nThe rituals involved with traiteurism are simple and time-honored, and they are careful to not transgress the teachings of the Catholic Church. The methods of the traiteurs are purported to be able to work on a person regardless of faith, should one be so moved as to ask for a treatment.\n\n\n\n\n"}

H. M.\" Lowe, CB (20 October 1861 – 7 February 1944) was a British Army officer who commanded the British forces in Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916 and received the surrender of the Irish republican forces.\n\nLowe was born in North-Western Provinces, India, to William Henry Lowe of the Indian Civil Service, and Caroline Charlotte Muir. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and commissioned in the 7th Dragoon Guards as a lieutenant on 22 October 1881. The following year he saw action in the Egyptian Campaign, where the 7th Dragoon Guards were part of the 1st Cavalry Brigade led by General Sir Baker Russell. Lowe was involved in the fighting at Kassassin, the Battle of Tel el-Kebir and the march on Cairo. He received the Egypt Medal and the Khedive's Star, a medal presented by Khedive Tawfiq to all officers and men engaged in the campaign. In 1886, Lowe went to Burma from India, where the 7th Dragoon Guards were stationed, as a special service officer to the Upper Burma Task Force during the guerrilla phase of the Third Anglo-Burmese War. Remaining in Burma until 1887, he received the India General Service Medal with two clasps. He was promoted to the rank of captain on 9 March 1887 and major on 2 March 1892.\n\nOn 19 September 1899, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and assumed command of the 7th Dragoon Guards. The regiment embarked the SS \"Armenian\" in Southampton on 8 February 1900, and departed for service in South Africa, with Lowe in command of the men on the ship. From 1900 to 1902, he led the regiment in the Second Boer War, being present at the capture of Pretoria and the Battle of Diamond Hill, and was promoted brevet colonel in November 1900. Lord Kitchener's despatch of 8 August 1901 related how \"at midnight on the 30th July Colonel Lowe, 7th Dragoon Guards, successfully surprised a farmhouse, from which he took 11 armed prisoners with rifles, bandoliers and horses.\" Lowe was twice more Mentioned in Despatches: in Lord Roberts' Recommendations, 2 April 1901 and in \nLord Kitchener's Final Despatch, 23 June 1902. He received both the Queen's and King's South Africa Medal. Following the end of the war in June 1902 he returned home on the SS \"Galeka\" which arrived in Southampton in October 1902.\n\nHe left the 7th Dragoon Guards in March 1903 to become Assistant Quartermaster-General of the II Corps (Southern Command), being promoted to full colonel. In May 1905, he went to the Northern Command as colonel in charge of cavalry records and staff officer for the Imperial Yeomanry. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1906. He went on half-pay in March 1907 and retired a year later.\n\nOn the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Lowe rejoined the army as Inspector of Cavalry, and was appointed as a Brigade Commander with rank of Brigadier-General in 1915. He was commander of the 3rd Reserve Cavalry Brigade, stationed at the Curragh Camp, at the outbreak of the Easter Rising on Monday, 24 April 1916. On being informed of the Rising by phone, he ordered the brigade to Dublin by train. Arriving himself at Kingsbridge railway station in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Lowe assumed command of British forces in Dublin and set about securing the line between the station, Dublin Castle and Trinity College, thus dividing the rebel positions north and south of the river. It was Lowe who ordered the shelling of Liberty Hall by field guns from Trinity College, and who ordered the Sherwood Foresters to continue advancing on Mount Street Bridge with a high cost in casualties. On Saturday, 29 April, after being approached by Nurse Elizabeth O'Farrell, he agreed to negotiate with the leaders only if they would surrender unconditionally, and at 2.30 pm that day, accompanied by Nurse O'Farrell, Patrick Pearse surrendered to Lowe.\n\nHe was awarded the honorary rank of major-general when he finally retired in March 1919.\n\nLowe married, in 1895, Frances Broster (died 29 September 1942), the widow of Captain Robert Harry Johnson of the 64th Foot Regiment and daughter of Francisco de Salvo, of Salerno, Sicily. They had a son, and a daughter Elizabeth, who became a nun. Their son, John, was a British Army officer who with his father also took part in the suppression of the Rising and accepting the surrender of Pearse —fought at Gallipoli and the Somme and subsequently became a Hollywood actor under the screen name John Loder. General Lowe died in London on 7 February 1944, aged 82. Neither an otherwise comprehensive obituary in \"The Times\" nor an entry in \"Who Was Who\" 1941–1950 made reference to his role in the Easter Rising, although it is mentioned in John Loder's autobiography, and there is a photograph of Pearse surrendering to him.\n\n"}
