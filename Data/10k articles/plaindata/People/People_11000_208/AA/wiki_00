After graduating from the Atheneum, he entered the Catholic seminary in Mechelen and in 1912 was ordained a priest. He then studied classical philology at the University of Louvain and received there, after an interruption of his studies by WWI, his doctorate in 1919. He then worked as a teacher in Schaerbeek and Nivelles and in 1922 received a scholarship at the \"Institut historique belge de Rome\" in Rome. From 1924 to 1927 in Paris he studied ancient and medieval calligraphy. From 1927 he taught Greek philology at the University of Louvain, where he was appointed professor in 1929 and taught until 1958. In 1935 he became honorary canon of the cathedral of Mechelen.\n\nDuring his doctoral studies, Adolphe Rome, who was very interested in mathematics since his school days, settled upon his life-long field of research, the ancient history of science. He received his doctorate with the thesis \"Les fonctions trigonométriques dans Héron d'Alexandrie\". Starting in the 1920s he began writing a critical edition (published from 1931 to 1943) of the commentaries on the Almagest of Ptolemy and the works of Theon of Alexandria , later continued by his student and successor Joseph Mogenet (1913–1980) and his student Anne Tihon (born 1944). Another of Rome's close associates was Albert Lejeune (1916–1988). In addition to his research on the ancient history of science, Rome published essays on many topics of classical philology, such as the works of Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides and Theocritus.\n\nIn 1932 he was one of the co-founders of the magazine \"L'Antiquité classique\". In the 1950s, he became editor-in-chief of the science-historical journal \" Isis \".\n\nAdolphe Rome was elected a corresponding member in 1948 and in 1950 a regular member of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium. In 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) on \"The calculation of an eclipse of the sun according to Theon of Alexandria\".\n\nSee the list of publications in \" Bibliographie Académique \" 6, 1914–1934, pp. 132–134; 7, 1934–1954, pp. 233–234; 8, 1954–1955, p. 99; 10, 1957–1963, pp. 369–370.\n"}

The rebels then convened the Grand Majles of 500 delegates from different backgrounds, which placed Ahmad Shah, Mohammad Ali's six-year-old son, on the Sun Throne.\n\nThe Grand Majlis enacted many reforms. They abolished class representation; created five new seats in the Majles for minorities: two seats for Armenians, and one seat each for Jews, Zoroastrians, and Assyrians. The Majles also democratized the electoral system, diminished the electoral dominance of Tehran, and even lowered the voting age from twenty-five to twenty.\n\nNot much is known about Ahmad's early life before his succession to the throne. Due to his young age, his uncle, Ali Reza Khan Azod al-Molk, governed as regent.\n\nAhmad Shah was formally crowned on 21 July 1914, upon reaching his majority. He attempted to fix the damage done by his father by appointing the best ministers he could find. He was, however, an ineffective ruler who was faced with internal unrest and foreign intrusions, particularly by the British Empire and Russian Empire. Russian and British troops fought against the Ottoman Empire forces in Persia during World War I.\n\nThe Second Majlis convened on November 1910 and just like the First Majlis, did not lead to any relevant accomplishment. The Majlis was rendered ineffective because the central government was weak and did not have enough influence to reign in the changes that it had proposed.\n\nIn 1917, Britain used Persia as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917. The newly born Soviet Union responded by annexing portions of northern Persia as buffer states much like its Tsarist predecessor. Marching on Tehran, the Soviets extracted ever more humiliating concessions from the Persian government – whose ministers Ahmad Shah was often unable to control. The weakness of the government in the face of such aggression by an atheist foreign power sparked seething anger among many traditional Persians – including the young Ruhollah Khomeini, who would later condemn both Communism and monarchy as treason against Persia's sovereignty and the laws of Islam.\n\nBy 1920, the government had virtually lost all power outside the capital and Ahmad Shah had lost control of the situation. The Anglo-Persian Agreement, along with new political parties, further immobilized the country. The Moderates and Democrats often clashed, particularly when it came to minority rights and secularism. The debates between the two political parties led to violence and even assassinations.\n\nThe weak economic state of Persia put Ahmad Shah and his government at the mercy of foreign influence; they had to obtain loans from the Imperial Bank of Persia. Furthermore, under the Anglo-Persian Agreement, Persia received only a small fraction of the income generated by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On the other hand, the Red Army along with rebels and warlords ruled much of the countryside.\n\nOn 21 February 1921, Ahmad Shah was pushed aside in a military coup by Colonel Reza Khan, Minister of War and commander of the Persian Cossack Brigade, who subsequently seized the post of Prime Minister. During the coup, Reza Khan used three thousand men and only eighteen machine guns, a very bloodless coup that moved forward quickly. Reza Khan was a self-made man who climbed his way up through the military ranks and appeared to be the right man to take back control of Persia. One of his first actions was to rescind the Anglo-Persian Agreement, and this was seen as a very successful diplomatic move since the treaty was very unpopular. In addition, he signed the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship. This agreement canceled all previous treaties between the two countries and also gave Persia full and equal shipping rights in the Caspian Sea.\n\nStripped of all his remaining powers, Ahmad Shah went into exile with his family in 1923. Ahmad Shah's apparent lack of interest in attending to the affairs of the state and poor health had prompted him to leave Persia on this extended \"European Tour\". He was formally deposed on 31 October 1925, when Reza Khan was proclaimed Shah by the Majlis, as Reza Shah Pahlavi. This terminated the Qajar Dynasty and established the Pahlavi Dynasty.\n\nThe coup of 1921 rendered Ahmad Shah politically weaker and less relevant. In 1923, Ahmad Shah left Persia for Europe for health reasons. Later, the formal termination of the Qajar Dynasty by the Majles, turned Ahmad Shah's 1923 European tour into exile.\n\nPrior to his death, it is said that Ahmad Shah followed frequent crash diets which did not help his health. For example, he lost and gained 90 kg within a two-year span. He died in 1930 at Neuilly-sur-Seine, outside Paris, France, and was buried in his family crypt in Kerbela, Iraq. His brother, former crown prince Mohammad Hassan Mirza, assured the continuation of the dynasty through his descendants.\n\nAhmad Shah Qajar married five times. His first wife was Lida Jahanbani. He had four children, each by a different wife.\n\n\nHe had 12 grandchildren, who respectively carry the last names Albertini, Faroughy, Panahi and Qajar (also spelled Kadjar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word first appears in English around 1552.\n\n\"‘Late Greek “anthrōpopatheia” - humanity, possession of human feelings, from Greek anthrōpopathēs having human feelings (from anthrōp- anthrop- + -pathēs -path) + -ia’\"\n\n“Basically it is cannibalism, but its purpose is not feeding from other human flesh to satisfy hunger, but to transfer powers (of warriors, witch doctors, people with ‘spiritual powers’...) through eating of body parts, like heart, brain, liver etc.” (L. Jersin, November 2018)\n\nIn popular culture, the \"anthropophagus\" is sometimes depicted as a being without a head, but instead have their faces on the torso. This may be a misinterpretation based on Shakespeare's writings in \"Othello\", where the \"anthropophagi\" are mistaken to be described by the immediate following line, \"and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.\" In reality, the line actually refers to a separate, different race of mythical beings known as the Blemmyes, who are indeed said to have no head, and have their facial features on the chest.\n\nPeople spell this creature's name in several different ways, 'anthropophagi' or 'anthropophage' being two examples.\nHerodotus first wrote of \"andropophagi\" in his \"Histories\", where he described them as one of several tribes near Scythia. An extra note indicates that the \"andropophagi\" are cannibals, as reflected in their name:\n\nPliny the Elder later wrote in his \"Naturalis Historia\" that the same cannibals near Scythia wore the scalps of men on their chest.\n\nAmmianus Marcellinus wrote in his \"Res Gestae\" a description of the Anthropophagi.\n\nIt is likely that the ancient Greek account influenced later writers. The most famous usage appears in William Shakespeare's \"Othello\":\n\nShakespeare makes yet another reference to the cannibalist \"anthropophagus\" in the \"Merry Wives of Windsor\":\n\nAmerican novelist Rick Yancey incorporates the myths of the Anthropophagi in his 2010 release \"The Monstrumologist\".\n\n\nOxford English Dictionary\n"}

He was a six-time United States congressman from Virginia's 9th congressional district from 1907 to 1923 and served as the presidential secretary to President Calvin Coolidge. As a philanthropist, Slemp set up the \"Slemp Foundation\", which provides gifts and scholarships to schools and colleges in Southwestern Virginia.\n\nSlemp was born on September 4, 1870 at Turkey Cove, Virginia in Lee County to Colonel Campbell Slemp, who later became a United States Representative from the 9th district of Virginia(1903 to 1907). His mother was Nancy (Nannie) Britain Cawood of Harlan County, Kentucky. His father was an officer in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. The 64th Virginia Regimental History indicates her brother had enlisted in the Union army but became sick and went AWOL, dying at home early in the war while MPs attempted to return him to his unit, Jefrrey G.

Slemp (1865-1889), Susan Jane Slemp Newman (1869-1935), and Laura Alpha Drucilla Slemp Habourn (1877-1900).\n\nSlemp attended the Methodist-run \"Seminary\" in Turkey Cove, and had a private tutor (William Davidson of King College), and also at age 9 became a page in the Virginia House of Delegates after his father's election to the Virginia General Assembly in 1879. In 1887, the 16 year old Slemp entered the Corp of Cadets at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. In 1891, he graduated with the highest grade point average in the school's history — a record that stands today. He also received the Jackson Medal for Most Distinguished Student four years in a row.\n\nBascom Slemp then studied law for a year at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1901.\n\nHe briefly married Roberta Trousdale Barton (1891-1911) in New Orleans, Louisiana on December 26, 1911, but their daughter was stillborn the following year.\n\nSlemp served as Commandant of Cadets at the Marion Military Institute for one year, after which he was hired as the second Principal of the Stonega Academy in Big Stone Gap (1893-1895). Slemp then taught at VMI as Professor of Mathematics for several years. In 1901, after being admitted to the Virginia bar, he resigned his position at the Institute to set up a law practice in Big Stone Gap. Slemp became president of the Slemp Coal Company and of the Hamilton Realty Company, among other business interests.\n\nHis father Campbell Slemp served in the United States House of Representatives from 1903 to 1907, controlling patronage in the state as well as representing Virginia's 9th congressional district until his unexpected death in October, 1907. In 1905, Bascom Slemp became chairman of Virginia's Republican State Committee, where he served until 1918, at which point he was elected to the Republican National Committee.\n\nBascom Slemp won the special election to fill his father's vacancy, and also won reelection six times, serving from 1907 until March 3, 1923, after he declined to be a candidate for re-election. As the leading Republican in the Old Dominion, he faced a difficult battle for re-election in 1910, after Democrats persuaded Henry C. Stuart to run against him, and used the slogan \"Redeem the District.\" Theodore Roosevelt gave a speech for Slemp, who won by a margin of about 200 votes. Although Stuart initially refused to concede defeat, his contest failed, in part because all 265 precincts had a Democratic registrar, two Democratic clerks and at least two Democratic judges. \n\nOn September 4, 1923, six months after Slemp completed his last term as Congressman, President Calvin Coolidge appointed him to serve as his Secretary, a post similar to the later White House Chief of Staff. Slemp served until March 4, 1925. He resigned early in Coolidge's second term after friction between himself and the President was unable to be resolved and was succeeded by Everett Sanders.\n\nAfter leaving the Coolidge administration, Slemp returned to his law practice in Big Stone Gap, Virginia and Washington D.C. In 1930, President Herbert Hoover appointed Slemp as United States Commissioner General to the International Colonial and Overseas Exposition in Paris, and at its conclusion in 1931, France awarded Slemp the French Legion of Honor Medal. By the 1930 Census, Slemp lived in Big Stone Gap with his sister S. Janie and her husband John W. Newman and several servants. With Janie's help, Slemp established the Southwest Virginia Museum, and after his death the Commonwealth accepted many pieces bequeathed to it.\n\nSlemp often maintained a local residence with siblings, remained a prominent member of the southwest Virginia community and political scene until his death. He died at St. Mary's hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee on August 7, 1943, aged 73, of long-standing heart disease, He was later buried in the family cemetery at Turkey Cove.\n\nAs a philanthropist, Slemp continues to touch many young lives through the Slemp Foundation, established in his will and which provides gifts to libraries, schools and colleges in Southwestern Virginia. The \"Lonesome Pine Regional Library\" (which serves Lee, Dickenson, and Wise Counties, Virginia) has received support from the foundation, and its branch in Big Stone Gap is named in Slemp's honor.\n\nThe Slemp Scholarship, named in honor of the late congressman, is awarded to outstanding college students who graduated from schools in Lee, Scott, and Wise Counties, Virginia.\n\nIn October 2003, the long-planned \"C.

Years later, her parents divorced which resulted in her mother, Dorothy, moving Carole and her sisters to Honolulu, Hawaii and later Cleveland, Ohio. She went on to marry Michael Noon, who she later divorced.\n\nNoon attained a bachelor's degree from Florida Atlantic University. She then earned a master's in anthropology and a doctorate in biological anthropology, under Dr. Linda Wolfe from the University of Florida, specializing in captive chimpanzees. She conducted much of her field research at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia, where chimpanzees were orphaned by the bushmeat trade in Africa. There, she completed her dissertation on the re-socialization of chimpanzees and earned her PhD in 1996.\n\nFollowing the US Air Force’s decision to bid away all its chimpanzees in 1997, with the help of Jane Goodall, Noon co-created Save The Chimps Foundation, which is known today has the world’s largest sanctuary for chimpanzees. Noon’s bid for the chimpanzees was rejected, and they were later sent to the Coulston Foundation, who was known for violating the Animal Welfare Act. Noon went on to sue the US Air Force and settled out of court for the custody of 21 out of the 140 chimps.

{"id": "59361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59361", "title": "Eiji Tsuburaya", "text": "Eiji Tsuburaya\n\nDuring his rise to post-war fame in the wake of \"Godzilla\" (1954), many press accounts gave Tsuburaya's birthdate as July 7, which falls on the high day of the star festival, \"Tanabata\", a sign of good fortune. This is akin to an American saying that they were born on the Fourth of July. Tsuburaya's actual birthdate of July 10 has been verified by his last surviving son, Akira, and the company Eiji founded, Tsuburaya Productions, as the official entry in the Tsuburaya Family Register, in researching the official English-language biography on this important figure of cinema, \"Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters\", Chronicle Books, 2007.\n\nTsuburaya described his childhood as filled with \"mixed emotions.\" He was the first son of Isamu and Sei Tsumuraya, with a large extended family. His mother died when he was only three and his father moved to China for the family business. Young Eiji was raised by his barely older uncle, Ichiro, and his paternal grandmother, Natsu. He attended elementary school at the \"Sukagawa Choritsu Dai'ichi Jinjo Koutou Shogakko\" beginning in 1908, and two years later, he took up the hobby of building model airplanes, due to the sensational success of Japanese aviators, an interest he would retain for the rest of his life. In 1915, at the age of 14, he graduated the equivalent of High School, and begged his family to let him enroll in the Nippon Flying school at Haneda. After the school was closed on account of the accidental death of its founder, Seitaro Tamai, in 1917, Tsuburaya attended trade school. He became quite successful in the research and development department of the Utsumi toy company, but a chance meeting at a company party in 1919, set the course for his destiny—he was offered a job by director Yoshiro Edamasa, a job that would train him to be a motion picture cameraman. While the Tsuburaya family's traditional religion was Nichiren Buddhism, Tsuburaya converted to Roman Catholicism in his later years (his wife had already been a practicing Roman Catholic).\n\nIn 1919, his first job in the film industry was as an assistant cinematographer at the \"Nihon Katsudou Shashin Kabushiki-kaisha\" (Nihon Cinematograph Company or \"Kokkatsu\" for short) in Kyoto, which later became better known as Nikkatsu. After serving as a member of the correspondence staff to the military from 1921 to 1923, he joined Ogasaware Productions. He was head cameraman on \"Hunchback of Enmeiin\" (Enmeiin no Semushiotoko), and served as assistant cameraman on Teinosuke Kinugasa's ground-breaking 1925 film, \"Kurutta Ippeiji\" (\"A Page of Madness\").\n\nHe joined Shochiku Kyoto Studios in 1926 and became full-time cameraman there in 1927. He began using and creating innovative filming techniques during this period, including the first use of a camera crane in Japanese film. In the 1930 film \"Chohichiro Matsudaira\", he created a film illusion by super-imposition. Thus began the work for which he would become known—special visual effects.\n\n1930 was also the year of his marriage to Masano Araki. Hajime, the first of their three sons, was born a year later. During the 1930s, he moved among a number of studios and became known for his meticulous work. It was during this period that he saw a film that would point towards his future career. After his international success with \"Godzilla\" in 1954, he said, \"When I worked for Nikkatsu Studios, \"King Kong\" came to Kyoto and I never forgot that movie. I thought to myself, 'I will someday make a monster movie like that'\".\n\nIn 1938 he became head of Special Visual Techniques at Toho Tokyo Studios, setting up an independent special effects department in 1939. He expanded his technique greatly during this period and earned several awards, but did not stay long at Toho.\n\nDuring the war years (the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II) he directed a number of propaganda films and produced their special effects for Toho's Educational Film Research Division created by decree of the imperial government. Those include \"Kōdō Nippon\" (\"The Imperial Way of Japan\") (1938), \"Kaigun Bakugeki-tai\" (\"Naval Bomber Squadron\") (1940), \"The Burning Sky\" (\"Moyuru ōzora\") (1940), \"Hawai Mare oki kaisen\" (\"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\") (1942), \"Decisive Battle in the Skies\" (\"Kessen-no Ōzara-e\") (1943) and \"Kato hayabusa sento-tai\" (1944). According to legend, Tsuburaya's work on \"The War at Sea...\" was so impressive that General MacArthur's film unit is said to have sold footage of the film to Frank Capra for use in Movietone newsreels as footage of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nDuring the occupation of Japan following the war, Tsuburaya's wartime association with such propaganda films proved a hindrance to his finding work for some time. He went freelance with his own production company, \"Tsuburaya Visual Effects Research\" (working on films for other studios), until he returned to Toho in the early 1950s.\n\nAs head of Toho's Visual Effects Department (which was known as the \"Special Arts Department\" until 1961), that he established in 1939, he supervised an average of sixty craftsmen, technicians and cameramen. It was here that he became part of the team, along with director Ishirō Honda and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, that created the first \"Godzilla\" film in 1954, and were dubbed by Toho's advertising department as \"The Golden Trio\".\n\nFor his work in \"Godzilla\" (ゴジラ - Gojira), Tsuburaya won his first \"Film Technique Award\". In contrast to the stop motion technique most famously used by Willis O'Brien to create the 1933 \"King Kong\", Tsuburaya used a man in a rubber suit to create his giant monster effects. This technique, now most closely associated with Japanese \"kaiju\" or monster movies, has come to be called suitmation (originated in the Japanese fan press during the 1980s). Through intense lighting and high-speed filming, Tsuburaya was able to add to the realism of the effects by giving them a slightly slower, ponderous weightiness. This technique, using detailed miniatures with men-in-monster-suits, is still being used today (but combined with CGI techniques as well) and is now considered a traditional Japanese craft art.\n\nThe tremendous success of \"Godzilla\" led Toho to produce a series of science fiction films, films introducing new monsters, and further films involving the Godzilla character itself. The most critically and popularly successful of these films were those involving the team of Tsuburaya, Honda and Tanaka, along with the fourth member of the \"Godzilla\" team, composer Akira Ifukube. Tsuburaya continued producing the special effects for non-kaiju films like \"The H-Man\" (1958), and \"The Last War\" (1961), and won another Japanese Movie Technique Award for his work in the 1957 science-fiction film \"The Mysterians\". He also won another award in 1959 for the creation of the \"Toho Versatile System\", an optical printer for widescreen pictures, which he built in-house and first used on \"The Three Treasures\" in 1959 (Tsuburaya was continually frustrated by the poor state of equipment he was forced to use, and Toho's money-pinching that prevented the acquisition of new motion picture technologies).\n\nA loyal company man, Tsuburaya continued to work at Toho Studios until his death in 1970 of a heart attack.\n\nIn the 1940s, Tsuburaya started his own special effects laboratory (set up at his home), and in 1963, founded his own studio for visual effects, Tsuburaya Productions. In 1966 alone, this company aired the first \"Ultra\" series for television, \"Ultra Q\" beginning in January, followed it with the highly popular \"Ultraman\" in July, and premiered a comedy-monster series, \"Booska, the Friendly Beast\" in November. \"Ultraman\" became the first live-action Japanese television series to be exported around the world, and spawned the \"Ultra\" series which continues to this day.\n\nIn honor of the 114th anniversary of his birth, Google made an animated doodle of his skill with special effects on July 7, 2015 (the legendary, but not factual, date of his birth).\n\nDuring his 50-year career, he worked on approximately 250 films in total. His Special Effects works include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is a member of the Hazara ethnic group of Afghanistan.\n\nSoroor was born in Iran into a religious family of refugees who left Afghanistan during the civil war, and lived there for 14 years. She and her family moved back to Afghanistan in 2005. During her high school years, Soroor worked as a news reporter for a local radio station in Kondoz, a city in the north of Afghanistan, and also for the Bakhtar news agency. At the same time, she taught literacy and maths to young girls and women from her neighborhood who were not allowed to attend school under Taliban law.\n\nAs a young woman in Kondoz (at the time, the Taliban still had influence on people of the area), Soroor was not afraid to openly challenge conservative views and fight for a more equal society. She was labeled by locals as a political activist, meaning she and her family were forced to leave Kondoz after receiving death threats from fundamentalist groups.\n\nAfter moving to Kabul with her family in 2007 Soroor began to develop her passion for music. She studied at music school where she specialized in traditional Afghan folk music whilst also studying western harmony, and started performing with Afghani group, Aryan. All this was done in secret without the consent or support of her family, who were against her performing as a professional musician. Upon finding out, they prevented her from singing for a year.\n\nSoroor's voice was discovered by the judges of the TV talent show \"Afghan Star\" in 2009, where she gained popularity nationally among Afghan communities around the world, being the first female Hazara singer to perform on national TV.\n\nHer first two original songs, \"Abi Jan\" and \"Be Bahana\" were released in 2009. In 2010 she recorded \"Sangsar\", a song which openly criticises the \"stoning law\" practiced by some Muslim communities.

Initially a wine merchant and importer, today he is a wine writer.\n\nBorn in London and raised partly in rural Essex because of the Blitz, Asher's career in wine began in 1950, when he took a part-time job at a wine retailer in London's Shepherd Market. He founded his own merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, in 1955, to import rare and lesser-known French wines to Britain. Active until 1970, the firm was widely seen as ground-breaking for its introduction to the British market of several previously obscure wines that proceeded to become popular. In 1971, Asher relocated to New York to take up a senior position at Austin, Nichols and Co, which imported Bordeaux-classed wines to the United States. The next year he also became wine editor at \"Gourmet\" magazine, a post he would hold for the next three decades, writing the \"Wine Journal\" column, which eventually became monthly. In 1974, he received the Mérite agricole from the French government for his contributions to French agriculture.\n\nHe moved the same year to San Francisco, where he became head of the Monterey Wine Company. He writes that he had \"a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine\", having never tasted any before a 1967 visit, but he soon began championing it, organising the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner along with Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of New York's Four Seasons Restaurant. The barrel tasting, which started in 1976, played an important role in building the image and understanding of California wines on the East Coast of the United States, and over the next decade became seen by critics as the wine event of the year. Asher started the Mosswood Wine Company in 1978, within the McKesson Corporation, and headed it until 1987, when McKesson sold off its interests in wine and spirits to concentrate on pharmaceuticals. Asher took early retirement to focus solely on his wine writing, which he continues today.\n\nHe retained the post of wine editor at \"Gourmet\" until 2002, and thereafter contributed a selection of wines to each issue until the magazine discontinued in 2009. Many of his wine essays from \"Gourmet\" have been republished in book form; five volumes of these columns have been published, most recently \"A Carafé of Red\" in 2012. Asher's writing and knowledge of wine are both acclaimed, with British wine critic Jancis Robinson calling him \"America's most elegant wine writer\". James Beard, an American chef and food writer, says Asher's writing \"makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his ... awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine.\" Asher has received many accolades for his writing and work with wine during his life. He was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame by the Culinary Institute of America in 2009.\n\nGerald Asher was born in London in 1932. The family moved to rural Essex at the onset of the Blitz, and Asher was partly raised there, attending Westcliff High School for Boys in Westcliff-on-Sea.\n\nAsher entered the wine industry in 1950, at the age of 18, when he took a part-time job assisting a wine retailer in Shepherd Market, between Curzon Street and Piccadilly in Mayfair, Central London. Within a year he had taken a full-time position with a small wine distributor, and by 1952 he was engaged by Blumenthal & Co, a major wine importer. Sponsored by Blumenthal, he attended tastings and lectures held by the Wine Trade Club at the Worshipful Company of Vintners in London, and in 1953 a scholarship allowed him to spend time working and studying in Jerez, the Spanish region that produces Sherry. Further such scholarships over the next two years despatched Asher to Burgundy in eastern France, then the Rheingau wine region in West Germany.\n\nIn 1955, aged 23, Asher founded his own London merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, to import rare and lesser-known French wines to Britain. The new firm was regarded as ground-breaking, and was for a long time unique in the British market. A 1983 \"Punch\" retrospective described its formation as \"a breeze of change through the wine trade here [in Britain] and the trade of writing about wine.\" Many of the wines the firm introduced to British consumers, including Beaumes de Venises, Arbois, Bandol, Chateau Grillet, Cahors and others, were considered utterly unknown when the company began, but soon became well known and popular. By December 1969, \"The Observer\" was describing the company as \"famous for its list of the lesser-known wines of France: wines from the Loire, and the Jura, from Provence and from Savoy.\"\n\nAsher wound up Asher, Storey in 1971, when he moved to New York City to become Vice-President and National Wine Sales Manager at Austin, Nichols and Co, perhaps better known as the distiller of Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey, but also an American importer of Bordeaux-classed wines from France. He joined the French wine committee of the U.S. National Association of Wine Importers, and became chairman of the Champagne Importers' Association. Around this time he also became interested in California wine, which he had first encountered during his first visit to San Francisco in 1967. In 1972, he was invited by Jane Montant of \"Gourmet\" magazine to start contributing essays on a periodical basis as the journal's Wine Editor, a role he would hold for the next three decades. Two years later, he was awarded the Mérite agricole by the government of France for his contributions to French agriculture.\n\nAsher moved to San Francisco in 1974 to head the Monterey Wine Company, a joint venture between the McKesson Corporation and the McFarlane family to market The Monterey Vineyard's wines. He retained this role until 1976. He writes that he had \"a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine\", having never tasted any before his 1967 visit, but soon came to regard it as on a par with that from France. Surprised that wine from California was, in his own words, \"more exotically rare in New York than many European\" wines, he hit upon the idea of holding an annual tasting of California wine in New York, using as models the Paulée de Meursault tasting of Burgundy wine and its grander cousin, the Paulée de Paris held at Taillevent, with \"the same elegant context ... but with an American flavour\".\n\nAsher approached several Californian growers with this idea, but most were hesitant to take part. The idea became more real when the winemakers Karl Wente and Robert Mondavi agreed to participate. Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of the prestigious Four Seasons Restaurant in Manhattan agreed to organise the practicalities of such an event in return for Asher's coordination of the California wineries' contributions. The first annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner was held at The Four Seasons in 1976, and soon became hugely popular; though there were only 228 places available for the 1978 tasting, over 2,000 people tried to buy tickets.\n\nAsher was vice-president of \"21\" Brands, a wine and spirits company within the McKesson Corporation, between 1976 and 1978. He then started the Mosswood Wine Company within the McKesson structure to import and distribute European wine across the United States. Meanwhile, Asher's annual California barrel tasting event in New York became highly acclaimed in the wine world; by 1985, it was being described in newspaper columns as the American wine industry's \"most prestigious social event\". \"Everybody who is anybody in the world of food and wine is invited to the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner,\" Ruth Riechl wrote for the \"Los Angeles Times\" that year; \"Ten years ago it was unclear whether anybody would even show up for the first dinner, held at the Four Seasons. This year the only problem was which one of the 10 people eager to fill each seat would[.]\" \"Invitations are as scarce as Manhattan taxis at rush hour,\" wrote \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist Kristine Curry.\n\nFollowing the 1985 event, described by two wine writers as \"the best ever\", the annual barrel tasting moved to California. Since it was still generally considered a runaway success in New York, this came as a surprise to many, and Margittai admitted he was sad to see it go: \"This is our pride and joy,\" he said, \"but the barrel tasting needs to go home\". The move was in part because of the event's popularity; so many people sought places each year that the restaurant was having to refuse tickets to some of its regular customers. The venue used in 1986, San Francisco's Stanford Court Hotel, could accommodate twice as many guests. \"Woody Allen may think that going West and dying are the same thing,\" Asher explained, \"but we're going to prove him wrong.\" The first barrel tasting in San Francisco was also considered a success by most who attended, with the main difference being the atmosphere, which Barbara Ensrud, a wine writer who had attended every barrel tasting so far, said was \"a lot more relaxed than it ever was in New York.\"\n\nIn 1987, McKesson sold off its wine and spirits operations so it could focus on pharmaceuticals. Aged 55, Asher took early retirement, and began to concentrate on his wine writing. His contributions to \"Gourmet\" magazine, which had evolved into a bi-monthly column called the \"Wine Journal\", now became monthly. Many of Asher's \"Wine Journal\" entries have been republished in book form as \"On Wine\" (1982), \"Vineyard Tales\" (1996), \"The Pleasures of Wine\" (2002), \"A Vineyard in My Glass\" (2011), and \"A Carafé of Red\" (2012). In 1996, he wrote the \"Wine Journal\", published as a cellar book by HarperCollins. A number of the \"Gourmet\" columns were translated and published in the Japanese version of \"Playboy\" magazine, and in 1997 some of these were published in translation as \"The Secret World of Wine\" by Shueisha of Tokyo. Asher stopped writing for \"Gourmet\" in February 2002, but he continued to contribute a selection of wines to the monthly menu published in each issue until the magazine discontinued in November 2009.\n\nIn addition to the many accolades he has won for his writing and work in the international wine trade—including \"Wine Writer of the Year\" from \"Wine & Vines\" magazine in 1984, a 1990 literature achievement award from the American Institute of Wine and Food, the San Francisco Wine Appreciation Guild's Literary Award for 2000, and the 2005 Journalism award from the New York-based European Wine Council—Asher was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame at the Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena, California in 2009.\n\nAsher is generally considered a highly respected authority in the field of wine, and has received acclaim throughout his career for his expertise and writing style, which is widely held to be elegant and enjoyable. In her 1997 book \"Tasting Pleasure\", British wine critic Jancis Robinson calls Asher \"America's most elegant wine writer\". S. Irene Virbila of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave \"A Carafé of Red\" a very positive review, describing Asher as a \"wonderful prose stylist ... His wide-ranging, astute appreciation is where it's at.\" In a glowing review of \"On Wine\" (1982), the American chef and food writer James Beard called the book \"a delight\". \"Reading it makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his personal views, his prejudices, his delightful sense of humour and his appreciation of life,\" Beard elaborated; \"not to mention his awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "714475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714475", "title": "Ghassanids", "text": "Ghassanids\n\nThe Ghassanid Kingdom (; \"al-Ghasāsinah\", also \"Banū Ghassān\" \"Sons of Ghassān\") was an Arab kingdom, founded by descendants of the Azd tribe from Yemen who immigrated in the early 3rd century to the Levant region, where some merged with Hellenized Christian communities, converting to Christianity in the first few centuries AD while others may have already been Christians before emigrating north to escape religious persecution.\n\nAfter settling in the Levant, the Ghassanids became a client state to the Eastern Roman Empire and fought alongside them against the Persian Sassanids and their Arab vassals, the Lakhmids. The lands of the Ghassanids also acted as a buffer zone protecting lands that had been annexed by the Romans against raids by Bedouin tribes.\n\nFew Ghassanids became Muslim following the Islamic Conquest; most Ghassanids remained Christian and joined Melkite and Syriac communities within what is now Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nOral tradition holds that the Ghassanids came from the city of Ma'rib in South Arabia and its surrounding cities and towns, modern day Yemen. Tradition holds that their exodus from the area was primarily due to the destruction of the Marib Dam, the story of which is detailed in the eponymous 34th chapter of the Quran. The Arabic proverb “They were scattered like the people of Saba” refers to that exodus in history. Migration did also occur in different waves, another prominent wave being the prosecution of Christian Arabs by Dhu Nawas and the mass graves where many who did not escape were buried alive – the same is recited in the Quran and referred to \"Asḥāb al-Ukhdūd\" (أصحاب الأخدود). The date of the migration to the Levant is unclear, but they are believed to have arrived in the region of Syria between 250-300 AD and later waves of migration circa 400 AD. Their earliest appearance in records is dated to 473 AD, when their chief Amorkesos signed a treaty with the Eastern Roman Empire acknowledging their status as foederati controlling parts of Palestine. He apparently became Chalcedonian at this time. By the year 510, the Ghassanids were no longer Miaphysite, but Chalcedonian. They became the leading tribe among the Arab foederati, such as Banu Amela and Banu Judham.\n\nAfter originally settling in the Levant, the Ghassanids became a client state to the Eastern Roman Empire.\nThe Romans found a powerful ally in the Ghassanids who acted as a buffer zone against the Lakhmids. In addition, as kings of their own people, they were also phylarchs, native rulers of client frontier states. The capital was at Jabiyah in the Golan Heights. Geographically, it occupied much of the eastern Levant, and its authority extended via tribal alliances with other Azdi tribes all the way to the northern Hijaz as far south as Yathrib (Medina).\n\nThe Ghassanids fought alongside the Byzantine Empire against the Persian Sassanids and Arab Lakhmids. The lands of the Ghassanids also continually acted as a buffer zone, protecting Byzantine lands against raids by Bedouin tribes. Among their Arab allies were the Banu Judham and Banu Amela.\n\nThe Eastern Roman Empire was focused more on the East and a long war with the Persians was always their main concern. The Ghassanids maintained their rule as the guardian of trade routes, policed Lakhmid tribes and was a source of troops for the imperial army. The Ghassanid king al-Harith ibn Jabalah (reigned 529–569) supported the Byzantines against Sassanid Persia and was given in 529 by the emperor Justinian I, the highest imperial title that was ever bestowed upon a foreign ruler; also the status of patricians. In addition to that, al-Harith ibn Jabalah was given the rule over all the Arab allies of the Byzantine Empire. Al-Harith was a Miaphysite Christian; he helped to revive the Syrian Miaphysite (Jacobite) Church and supported Miaphysite development despite Orthodox Byzantium regarding it as heretical. Later Byzantine mistrust and persecution of such religious unorthodoxy brought down his successors, al-Mundhir (reigned 569-582) and Nu'man.\n\nThe Ghassanids, who had successfully opposed the Persian allied Lakhmids of al-Hirah (Southern modern-day Iraq), prospered economically and engaged in much religious and public building; they also patronized the arts and at one time entertained the Arabian poets Nabighah adh-Dhubyani and Hassan ibn Thabit at their courts.\n\nThe Ghassanids remained a Byzantine vassal state until its rulers and the eastern Byzantine Empire were overthrown by the Muslims in the 7th century, following the Battle of Yarmuk in 636 AD. At the time of the Muslim conquest the Ghassanids were no longer united by the same Christian faiths: some of them accepted union with the Byzantine Chalcedonian church; others remained faithful to Miaphysitism and a significant number of them maintained their Christian religious identity and decided to side with the Muslim armies to emphasize their loyalty to their Arabic roots and in recognition of the wider context of a rising Arab Empire under the veil of Islam. It is worth noting that a significant percentage of the Muslim armies in the Battle of Mu'tah (معركة مؤتة) were Christian Arabs. Several of those Christian Arab tribes in today's modern Jordan who sided with the Muslim armies were recognized by exempting them from paying jizya (جزية). Jizya is a form of tax paid by non-Muslims – Muslims paid another form of tax called Zakah (زكاة). Later those who remained Christian joined Melkite Syriac communities. The remnants of the Ghassanids were dispersed throughout Asia Minor.\n\nThere are different opinions why Jabalah and his followers didn't convert to Islam. Some opinions go along the general idea that the Ghassanids were not interested yet in giving up their status as the lords and nobility of Syria. Below is quoted the story of Jabalah's return to the land of the Byzantines as told by 9th-century historian al-Baladhuri.\n\nJabalah ibn-al-Aiham sided with the Ansar (Azdi Muslims from Medina) saying, \"You are our brethren and the sons of our fathers\" and professed Islam. After the arrival of 'Umar ibn-al-Khattab in Syria, year 17 (636AD), Jabalah had a dispute with one of the Muzainah and knocked out his eye. 'Umar ordered that he be punished, upon which Jabalah said, \"Is his eye like mine? Never, by Allah, shall I abide in a town where I am under authority.\" He then apostatized and went to the land of the Greeks (the Byzantines). This Jabalah was the king of Ghassan and the successor of al-Harith ibn-abi-Shimr (or Chemor).\n\nAfter the fall of the first kingdom of Ghassan, King Jabalah ibn-al-Aiham established a Government-in-exile in Byzantium. Ghassanid influence on the empire lasted centuries; the climax of this presence was the elevation of one of his descendants, Nikephoros I (ruled 802-811) to the throne and his establishment of a short-lived dynasty that can be described as the Nikephorian or Phocid Dynasty in the 9th century. But Nikephoros was not only a mere Ghassanid descendant, he claimed the headship of the Ghassanid Dynasty using the eponym of King Jafna, the founder of the Dynasty, rather than merely express himself descendant of King Jabalah.\n\nEarlier kings are traditional, actual dates highly uncertain.\n\nThe Ghassanids reached their peak under al-Harith V and al-Mundhir III. Both were militarily successful allies of the Byzantines, especially against their enemies the Lakhmids, and secured Byzantium's southern flank and its political and commercial interests in Arabia proper. On the other hand, the Ghassanids remained fervently dedicated to Miaphysitism, which brought about their break with Byzantium and Mundhir's own downfall and exile, which was followed after 586 by the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation. The Ghassanids' patronage of the Miaphysite Syrian Church was crucial for its survival and revival, and even its spread, through missionary activities, south into Arabia. According to the historian Warwick Ball, the Ghassanids' promotion of a simpler and more rigidly monotheistic form of Christianity in a specifically Arab context can be said to have anticipated Islam. Ghassanid rule also brought a period of considerable prosperity for the Arabs on the eastern fringes of Syria, as evidenced by a spread of urbanization and the sponsorship of several churches, monasteries and other buildings. The surviving descriptions of the Ghassanid courts impart an image of luxury and an active cultural life, with patronage of the arts, music and especially Arab-language poetry. In the words of Ball, \"the Ghassanid courts were the most important centres for Arabic poetry before the rise of the Caliphal courts under Islam\", and their court culture, including their penchant for desert palaces like Qasr ibn Wardan, provided the model for the Umayyad caliphs and their court.\n\nAfter the fall of the first kingdom in the 7th century, several dynasties, both Christian and Muslim, ruled claiming to be a continuation of the House of Ghassan. Besides the Phocid or Nikephorian Dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, other rulers claimed to be the heirs of the Royal Ghassanids. The Rasulid Sultans ruled from the 13th until the 15th century in Yemen. And the Burji Mamluk Sultans in Egypt from the 14th until the 16th century. Even both dynasties being Muslim, they claimed to be heirs and successors of Ghassan. The last rulers to bear the titles of Royal Ghassanid successors were the Christian Sheikhs Al-Chemor in Mount Lebanon ruling the small sovereign sheikhdoms of Akoura (from 1211 until 1633 CE) and Zgharta-Zwaiya (from 1641 until 1747 CE)- \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "73313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73313", "title": "Hippolytus of Rome", "text": "Hippolytus of Rome\n\nHippolytus of Rome (170–235 AD) was one of the most important third-century theologians in the Diocese of Rome, where he was probably born. Photios I of Constantinople describes him in his \"Bibliotheca\" (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful. He came into conflict with the popes of his time and seems to have headed a schismatic group as a rival to the Bishop of Rome, thus becoming an Antipope. He opposed the Roman Popes who softened the penitential system to accommodate the large number of new pagan converts. However, he was reconciled to the Church before he died as a martyr.\n\nStarting in the fourth century, various legends arose about him, identifying him as a priest of the Novatianist schism or as a soldier converted by Saint Lawrence. He has also been confused with another martyr of the same name. Pope Pius IV identifies him as \"Saint Hippolytus, Bishop of Pontus\" who was martyred in the reign of Severus Alexander through his inscription on a statue found at the Church of Saint Lawrence in Rome and kept at the Vatican as photographed and published in Brunsen.\n\nAs a presbyter of the church at Rome under Pope Zephyrinus (199–217 AD), Hippolytus was distinguished for his learning and eloquence. It was at this time that Origen, then a young man, heard him preach.\n\nHe accused Pope Zephyrinus of modalism, the heresy which held that the names Father and Son are simply different names for the same subject. Hippolytus championed the Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists, most notably Justin Martyr, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\"Word\"). An ethical conservative, he was scandalized when Pope Callixtus I (217–222 AD) extended absolution to Christians who had committed grave sins, such as adultery.\n\nHippolytus himself advocated a pronounced rigorism. At this time, he seems to have allowed himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome, and continued to attack Pope Urban I (222–230 AD) and Pope Pontian (230–235 AD). G. Salmon suggests that Hippolytus was the leader of the Greek-speaking Christians of Rome. Allen Brent sees the development of Roman house-churches into something akin to Greek philosophical schools gathered around a compelling teacher.\n\nUnder the persecution at the time of Emperor Maximinus Thrax, Hippolytus and Pontian were exiled together in 235 to Sardinia, likely dying in the mines. It is quite probable that, before his death there, he was reconciled to the other party at Rome, for, under Pope Fabian (236–250 AD), his body and that of Pontian were brought to Rome. The so-called \"Chronography of 354\" (more precisely, the \"Liberian Catalogue\") reports that on August 13, probably in 236, the two bodies were interred in Rome, that of Hippolytus in a cemetery on the Via Tiburtina, his funeral being conducted by Justin the Confessor. This document indicates that, by about 255, Hippolytus was considered a martyr and gives him the rank of a priest, not of a bishop, an indication that before his death the schismatic was received again into the Church.\n\nThe facts of his life as well as his writing were soon forgotten in the West, perhaps by reason of his criticism of the bishops of Rome and because he wrote in Greek. Pope Damasus I dedicated to him one of his famous epigrams, making him, however, a priest of the Novatianist schism, a view later accepted by Prudentius in the 5th century in his \"Passion of St Hippolytus\". In the Passionals of the 7th and 8th centuries he is represented as a soldier converted by Saint Lawrence, a legend that long survived in the Roman Breviary. He was also confused with a martyr of the same name who was buried in Portus, of which city he was believed to have been a bishop, who was put to death by drowning in a deep well.\n\nAccording to Prudentius' account, Hippolytus was dragged to death by wild horses, a striking parallel to the story of the mythological Hippolytus, who was dragged to death by wild horses at Athens. He described the subterranean tomb of the saint and states that he saw there a picture representing Hippolytus' execution. He also confirms August 13 as the date on which a Hippolytus was celebrated but this again refers to the convert of Lawrence, as preserved in the Menaion of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nThe latter account led to Hippolytus being considered the patron saint of horses. During the Middle Ages, sick horses were brought to St Ippolyts, Hertfordshire, England, where a church is dedicated to him.\n\nHippolytus' principal work is the \"Refutation of all Heresies\". Of its ten books, Book I was the most important. It was long known and was printed (with the title \"Philosophumena\") among the works of Origen. Books II and III are lost, and Books IV–X were found, without the name of the author, in a monastery of Mount Athos in 1842. E. Miller published them in 1851 under the title \"Philosophumena\", attributing them to Origen of Alexandria. They have since been attributed to Hippolytus.\n\nIn 1551 a marble statue of a seated figure (originally female, perhaps personifying one of the sciences) was purportedly found in the cemetery of the Via Tiburtina and was heavily restored. On the sides of the seat was carved a paschal cycle, and on the back the titles of numerous writings by Hippolytus. Many other works are listed by Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome.\n\nHippolytus' voluminous writings, which for variety of subject can be compared with those of Origen, embrace the spheres of exegesis, homiletics, apologetics and polemic, chronography, and ecclesiastical law. Hippolytus recorded the first liturgical reference to the Virgin Mary, as part of the ordination rite of a bishop.\n\nOf exegetical works usually attributed to Hippolytus, the best preserved are the \"Commentary on the Prophet Daniel\" and the \"Commentary on the Song of Songs\". This is the earliest attested Christian interpretation of the Song, covering only the first three chapters to Song 3:7.\n\nThe commentary on the Song of Songs survives in two Georgian manuscripts, a Greek epitome, a Paleo-Slavonic florilegium, and fragments in Armenian and Syriac as well as in many patristic quotations, especially in Ambrose of Milan's \"Exposition on Psalm 118 (119)\". It is generally regarded as an instruction relating to a post-Baptismal rite of anointing with oil as a symbol of receiving the Holy Spirit. The commentary was originally written as part of a mystagogy, an instruction for new Christians. Scholars have usually assumed the \"Commentary On the Song of Songs\" was originally composed for use during Passover, a season favored in the West for Baptism. Hippolytus supplied his commentary with a fully developed introduction known as the \"schema isagogicum\", indicating his knowledge of the rhetorical conventions for teachers discussing classical works. He employs a common rhetorical trope, ekphrasis, using images on the walls or floors of Greco-Roman homes, and in the catacombs as paintings or mosaics. Origen felt that the Song should be reserved for the spiritually mature and that studying it might be harmful for the novice.\n\nAbout 215, he wrote the \"Apostolic Tradition\", which contains the earliest known ritual of ordination. The influence of Hippolytus was felt chiefly through his works on chronography and ecclesiastical law. His chronicle of the world, a compilation embracing the whole period from the creation of the world up to the year 234, formed a basis for many chronographical works both in the East and West. It is from the \"Apostolic Tradition\" that the current words of episcopal ordination in the Catholic Church come from, as updated by Pope Paul VI.\n\nIn the great compilations of ecclesiastical law that arose in the East since the 3rd century, the Church Orders many canons were attributed to Hippolytus, for example in the Canons of Hippolytus or the Constitutions through Hippolytus. How much of this material is genuinely his, how much of it worked over, and how much of it wrongly attributed to him, can no longer be determined beyond dispute, however a great deal was incorporated into the \"Fetha Negest\", which once served as the constitutional basis of law in Ethiopia — where he is still remembered as Abulides. During the early 20th century the work known as \"The Egyptian Church Order\" was identified as the Apostolic Tradition and attributed to Hippolytus; nowaday this attribution is hotly contested.\n\nDifferences in style and theology lead some scholars to conclude that some of the works attributed to Hippolytus actually derive from a second author. Two small but potentially important works, \"On the Twelve Apostles of Christ\" and \"On the Seventy Apostles of Christ,\" are often neglected because the manuscripts were lost during most of the church age and then found in Greece in the 19th century. As most scholars consider them to not have been written by him, they are often ascribed to \"\". The two are included in an appendix to the works of Hippolytus in the voluminous collection of Early Church Fathers. The work on the 70 apostles is noteworthy as a (potentially) early source.\n\nHippolytus is an important figure in the development of Christian eschatology. In \"On Christ and the Antichrist\" and \"Commentary on the Prophet Daniel\" Hippolytus gave his interpretation of Bible prophecies.\n\nWith the onset of persecutions during the reign of Septimus Severus, many early Christian writers turned to eschatology. \"On Christ and the Antichrist\" is one of his earliest works. Hippolytus was greatly influenced by Irenaeus. However, unlike Irenaeus, Hippolytus focuses on the meaning of prophecy for the Church in his own time. Of the dogmatic works, \"On Christ and the Antichrist\" survives in a complete state and was probably written about 202.\n\nHippolytus follows the long-established usage in interpreting Daniel's seventy prophetic weeks to be weeks of literal years. Hippolytus gave an explanation of Daniel's paralleling prophecies of chapters 2 and 7, which he, as with the other fathers, specifically relates to the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. His interpretation of events and their significance is Christological. He stated that Rome would be partitioned into ten kingdoms and these in turn would be followed by the rise of the dread Antichrist, who would oppress the saints. This would be ended by Christ's Second Advent, the resurrection of the righteous, and the destruction of said Antichrist. After which would come the judgment and burning up of the wicked.\n\nHippolytus did not subscribe to the belief that the Second Coming was imminent. He was apparently the first to set a specific date for the second Advent through calculation—AD 500—which was 260 years after his time. He assumed, like Irenaeus his teacher, that inasmuch as God made all things in six days, and these days symbolize a thousand years each, in six thousand years from the creation the end will come. He apparently based his calculation on the Septuagint which had the world beginning about 5500 BC.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the feast day of St Hippolytus falls on August 13, which is also the Apodosis of the Feast of the Transfiguration. Because on the Apodosis the hymns of the Transfiguration are to be repeated, the feast of St. Hippolytus may be transferred to the day before or to some other convenient day. The Eastern Orthodox Church also celebrates the feast of \"St Hippolytus Pope of Rome\" on January 30, who may or may not be the same individual.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church celebrates St Hippolytus jointly with St Pontian on August 13. The feast of Saint Hippolytus formerly celebrated on 22 August as one of the companions of Saint Timotheus was a duplicate of his 13 August feast and for that reason was deleted when the General Roman Calendar was revised in 1969. Earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology referred to the 22 August Hippolytus as Bishop of Porto. The Catholic Encyclopedia sees this as \"connected with the confusion regarding the Roman presbyter resulting from the Acts of the Martyrs of Porto. It has not been ascertained whether the memory of the latter was localized at Porto merely in connection with the legend in Prudentius, without further foundation, or whether a person named Hippolytus was really martyred at Porto, and afterwards confounded in legend with Hippolytus of Rome.\" This opinion is shared by a Benedictine source.\n\nEarlier editions of the Roman Martyrology also mentioned on 30 January a Hippolytus venerated at Antioch, but the details it gave were borrowed from the story of Hippolytus of Rome. Modern editions of the Roman Martyrology omit all mention of this supposed distinct Saint Hippolytus of Antioch.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "415870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415870", "title": "Iberians", "text": "Iberians\n\nThe Iberians (, from , \"Iberes\") were a set of peoples that Greek and Roman sources (among others, Hecataeus of Miletus, Avienus, Herodotus and Strabo) identified with that name in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula, at least from the 6th century BC. The Roman sources also use the term \"Hispani\" to refer to the Iberians.\n\nThe term \"Iberian\", as used by the ancient authors, had two distinct meanings. One, more general, referred to all the populations of the Iberian peninsula without regard to ethnic differences (Pre-Indo-European, Celts and non-Celtic Indo-Europeans). The other, more restricted ethnic sense, refers to the people living in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula, which by the 6th century BC had absorbed cultural influences from the Phoenicians and the Greeks. This pre-Indo-European cultural group spoke the Iberian language from the 7th to the 1st century BC.\n\nOther peoples possibly related to the Iberians are the Vascones, though more related to the Aquitani than to the Iberians. The rest of the peninsula, in the northern, central, northwestern, western and southwestern areas, was inhabited by Celts or Celtiberians groups and the possibly Pre-Celtic or Proto-Celtic Indo-European Lusitanians, Vettones, and the Turdetani.\n\nThe Iberian culture developed from the 6th century BC, and perhaps as early as the fifth to the third millennium BC in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula. The Iberians lived in villages and oppida (fortified settlements) and their communities were based on a tribal organization. The Iberians in the Spanish Levant were more urbanized than their neighbors in the central and northwestern regions of the Iberian peninsula. The peoples in the central and northwest regions were mostly Celtic, semi-pastoral and lived in scattered villages, though they also had a few fortified towns like Numantia. They had a knowledge of writing, metalworking, including bronze, and agricultural techniques.\n\nIn the centuries preceding Carthaginian and Roman conquest, Iberian settlements grew in social complexity, exhibiting evidence of social stratification and urbanization. This process was probably aided by trading contacts with the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. By the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC a series of important social changes led to the consolidation of an aristocracy and the emergence of a clientele system. \"This new political system led, among other things, to cities and towns that centered around these leaders, also known as territorial nucleation. In this context, the oppidum or fortified Iberian town became the centre of reference in the landscape and the political space.\"\n\nThe settlement of \"Castellet de Banyoles\" in Tivissa was one of the most important ancient Iberian settlements in the north eastern part of the Iberian peninsula that was discovered in 1912. Also, the 'Treasure of Tivissa', a unique collection of silver Iberian votive offerings was found here in 1927.\n\nLucentum was another ancient Iberian settlement, as well as Castelldefels Castle.\n\nMausoleum of Pozo Moro near the town of Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón in Castile-La Mancha seems to mark the location of another big settlement.\n\nSagunto is the location of an ancient Iberian and later Roman city of Saguntum, where a big fortress was built in the 5th century BC.\n\nGreek colonists made the first historical reference to the Iberians in the 6th century BC. They defined Iberians as non-Celtic peoples south of the Ebro river (Iber). The Greeks also dubbed as \"Iberians\" another people in the Caucasus region, currently known as Caucasian Iberians. It is thought that there is no connection between the two peoples.\n\nThe Iberians traded extensively with other Mediterranean cultures. Iberian pottery and metalwork has been found in France, Italy, and North Africa. The Iberians had extensive contact with Greek colonists in the Spanish colonies of Emporion, Rhode, and Hemeroskopeion. The Iberians may have adopted some of the Greeks' artistic techniques. Statues such as the Lady of Baza and the Lady of Elx are thought to have been made by Iberians relatively well acquainted with Greek art. Thucydides stated that one of the three original tribes of Sicily, the Sicani, were of Iberian origin, though \"Iberian\" at the time could have included what we think of as Gaul.\n\nThe Iberians also had contacts with the Phoenicians, who had established various colonies in southern Andalucia. Their first colony on the Iberian Peninsula was founded in 1100 BC and was originally called \"Gadir\", later renamed by the Romans as \"Gades\" (modern Cádiz). Other Phoenician colonies in southern Iberia included Malaka (Málaga), Sexi and Abdera.\n\nAfter the First Punic war, the massive war debt suffered by Carthage led them to attempt to expand their control over the Iberian peninsula. Hamilcar Barca began this conquest from his base at Cádiz by conquering the Tartessian Guadalquivir river region, which was rich in silver. After Hamilcar's death, his son-in-law Hasdrubal continued his incursions into Iberia, founding the colony of Qart Hadasht (modern Cartagena) and extending his influence all the way to the southern bank of the river Ebro. After Hasdrubal's assassination in 221 BC, Hannibal assumed command of the Carthaginian forces and spent two years completing the conquest of the Iberians south of the Ebro. In his first campaign, Hannibal defeated the Olcades, the Vaccaei and the Carpetani expanding his control over the river Tagus region. Hannibal then laid siege to Roman ally of Saguntum and this led to the beginning of the Second Punic War. The Iberian theater was a key battleground during this war and many Iberian and Celtiberian warriors fought for both Rome and Carthage, though most tribes sided with Carthage.\n\nRome sent Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio to conquer Iberia from Carthage. Gnaeus subsequently defeated the Iberian Ilergetes tribe north of the Ebro who were allied with Carthage, conquered the Iberian oppidum of Tarraco and defeated the Carthaginian fleet. After the arrival of Publius Scipio, Tarraco was fortified and, by 211 BC, the Scipio brothers had overrun the Carthaginian and allied forces south of the Ebro. However, during this campaign, Publius Scipio was killed in battle and Gnaeus died in the retreat. The tide turned with the arrival of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus in 210 BC. Scipio attacked and conquered Carthago Nova and defeated the army of Hasdrubal Barca at the Battle of Baecula (209-208). The war dragged on with Carthage sending more reinforcements until the Battle of Ilipa (modern Alcalá del Río in Sevilla province), which was a decisive victory for Publius Scipio Africanus. The Carthaginians retreated to Gades, and Publius Scipio gained control over the entire south of the peninsula. After this victory, the Ilergetes and other Iberian tribes revolted and it was only after this revolt that the Romans conquered the rest of the Carthaginian territories in southern Spain.\n\nAfter the Carthaginian defeat, the Iberian territories were divided into two major provinces, Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior. In 197 BC, the Iberian tribes revolted once again in the H. Citerior province. After securing these regions, Rome invaded and conquered Lusitania and Celtiberia. The Romans fought a long and drawn out campaign for the conquest of Lusitania. Wars and campaigns in the northern regions of the Iberian peninsula would continue until 16 BC, when the final rebellions of the Cantabrian Wars were defeated.\n\nIberian society was divided into different classes, including kings or chieftains (Latin: \"regulus\"), nobles, priests, artisans and slaves. Iberian aristocracy, often called a \"senate\" by the ancient sources, met in a council of nobles. Kings or chieftains would maintain their forces through a system of obligation or vassalage that the Romans termed \"fides\".\n\nThe Iberians adopted wine and olives from the Greeks. Horse breeding was particularly important to the Iberians and their nobility. Mining was also very important for their economy, especially the silver mines near Gader and Cartago Nova, the iron mines in the Ebro valley, as well as the exploitation of tin and copper deposits. They produced fine metalwork and high quality iron weapons such as the falcata.\n\nThe Iberians produced sculpture in stone and bronze, most of which was much influenced by the Greeks and Phoenicians, and other cultures such as Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences. The styles of Iberian sculpture are divided geographically into Levantine, Central, Southern, and Western groups, of which the Levantine group displays the most Greek influence. Iberian pottery and painting was also distinct and widespread throughout the region. A distinct feature of the culture, the pottery was primarily decorated with geometric forms in red but in some areas (from Murcia to the south of Catalonia) it also included figurative images.\n\nThe Iberian polytheistic religion was influenced by the Greek and Phoenician practices, as it is evident in their sculptures. The man-bull Bicha of Balazote (possibly a fertility deity) and various depictions of sphinxes and lions bear a resemblance to eastern Mediterranean mythological creatures. The Lady of Elche and Lady of Guardamar show clear Hellenistic influence. Phoenician and Greek deities like Tanit, Baal, Melkart, Artemis, Demeter and Asclepius were known in the region and worshiped. Currently few native Iberian gods are known, though the oracular healing deity \"Betatun\" is known from a Latin inscription at Fuertes del Rey. There was clearly an important female deity associated with the earth and regeneration as depicted by the Lady of Baza and linked with birds, flowers and wheat. The horse was also an important religious figure and an important sanctuary dedicated to Horses has been found in Mula (Murcia). There are many depictions of a \"horse taming god\" or \"lord of the horses\" (\"despotes hippon\"). The female goddess Ataegina is also widely attested in the inscriptions.\n\nIberians performed their rites in the open and also maintained sanctuaries in holy places like groves, springs and caves. Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a priestly class and Silius Italicus mentions priests in the region of Tartessos at a temple of Melqart. Evidence from pottery reveals some information about Iberian myth and ritual. Common themes are a celebratory ritual dance described by Strabo [c.f. 3.3.7.] and seen in a relief from Fuerte del Rey known as the \"Bastetania dance\" and the confrontation between the deceased and a wolf figure. Ritual sacrifice of animals was also common.\n\nIn Iberian eschatology, \"death was seen as the starting point for a journey symbolised by a crossing of the sea, the land or even the sky. Supernatural and mythical beings, such as the Sphinx or the wolf, and sometimes Divinity itself, accompanied and guided the deceased on this journey\". The Iberians incinerated their dead and placed their ashes in ceremonial urns, the remains were then placed in stone tombs.\n\nIberians venerated the war god Cariocecus.\n\nIberian soldiers were widely employed by Carthage and Rome as mercenaries and auxiliary troops. A large portion of Carthaginian forces during the Punic wars was made up of Iberians and Celtiberians. Iberian warfare was endemic and based on intertribal raiding and pillaging. In set piece battle, Iberians were known to regularly charge and retreat, throwing javelins and shouting at their opponents without actually committing to full contact combat. This sort of fighting was termed \"concursare\" by the Romans. The Iberians were particularly fond of ambushes and guerrilla tactics.\n\nAncient sources mention two major types of Iberian infantry, \"scutati\" and \"caetrati\". \"Scutati\" were heavily armored and carried large Celtic type scutum shield. The \"caetrati\" carried the caetra, a small Iberian buckler. Iberian armaments included the famed Gladius Hispaniensis, a curved sword called the falcata, straight swords, spears, javelins and an all iron spear called the Soliferrum. Iberian horsemen were a key element of Iberian forces as well as Carthaginian armies. Spain was rich with excellent wild horses and Iberian cavalry was some of the best in the ancient Mediterranean.\n\nIberians dwelt along eastern and southern coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula, that corresponds to the northwestern shores of the Mediterranean Sea (see the map), roughly in today's Catalonia, Eastern, Northeastern and Northern Aragon, Valencian Community, Murcia Region, Eastern Andalucia, and the Balearic Islands (in Spain), and also in today's Roussillon and parts of Languedoc (in France).\nThe peninsula has this name because ancient Greeks, Romans and other mediterranean peoples first contacted with peoples (tribes or tribal confederacies) that were Iberians in the ethnic and linguistic sense, although the majority of the Iberian Peninsula's peoples, that dwelt in the Northern, Central and Western regions (the majority of the peninsula's area), were not Iberians themselves in the ethnic and linguistic sense (they could only be considered Iberians in the geographical sense, i.e. they dwelt in the Iberian Peninsula).\n\nThe Iberian tribes or tribal confederacies were:\n\n\nThe Iberian language, like the rest of the paleohispanic languages, became extinct by the 1st to 2nd centuries AD, after being gradually replaced by Latin. The Iberian language remains an unclassified non-Indo European language. A 1978 study claimed many similarities between Iberian and the Messapic language. Iberian languages also share some elements with the Basque language. Links have also been found with the Etruscan language and Minoan Linear A.\n\nThe Iberians use three different scripts to represent the Iberian language.\n\nNortheastern Iberian script and southeastern Iberian script share a common distinctive typological characteristic, also present in other paleohispanic scripts: they present signs with syllabic value for the occlusives and signs with monofonematic value for the rest of consonants and vowels. From a writing systems point of view, they are neither alphabets nor syllabaries, they are mixed scripts that normally are identified as semi-syllabaries. About this common origin, there is no agreement between researchers: for some this origin is only linked to the Phoenician alphabet while for others the Greek alphabet had participated too.\n\n\n\n"}

After completing the department's course for junior diplomats in 1984, he took on a role promoting international environmental preservation.\n\nIn November 2003, Cotan took up a post as Ambassador of Indonesia to Australia. Speaking about on his time in Australia at the end of the posting in 2005, Cotan reflected that the relationship was difficult when he first came to Canberra in 2003 because of events that happened in East Timor in 1999. Cotan said the aid and relief Australia's military had provided to Indonesia in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami had brought the two countries closer. He said however that he was stunned at the way Australians reacted to the arrest and sentencing of Schapelle Corby for drug smuggling in 2004–05—some Australians wanted the country's tsunami aid taken into account in Corby's sentencing.\n\nCotan was appointed Ambassador of Indonesia to China in 2010. In an interview in 2011, Cotan said he was proud to see the relationship between the two countries reach its highest point ever. While he was ambassador, the Indonesian Government opened a consulate general in Shanghai, which was expected to enhance the ties between the two nations.\n"}

After several Turks abducted his sister Teodora, Janko, a young and courageous man, with several comrades chased them down and killed them. As it was unsafe for him to remain in his home region, he moved to the village of Boleč between Belgrade and Grocka. He joined the Serbian Free Corps and participated in the Austro-Turkish War and Koča's frontier rebellion, where he gained military experience. Known for his bravery, he was chosen to be a \"knez\" (village chieftain) in Boleč during the Habsburg occupation of Serbia. After the war and return of Ottoman rule, the Janissaries began to empower themselves. In 1801, the Janissary leaders, known as \"Dahije\", took over the Sanjak of Smederevo in defiance of the Sultan. Janko had by become an influential brigand. Janko was unreluctant in attacking Dahije and controlled a road to Smederevo near Boleč along with his comrades. When the Dahije started to fear that the Sultan would make use of the Serbs to oust them, they decided to execute notable Serbs to forestall this. As a notable hajduk commander, Janko was subject of fear among Turks, which is why he was targeted; the Turks abducted his son, forcing Janko to surrender. He was decapitated. His death was described in the Serbian epic folk poem \"Otac\" (\"The Father\").\n\nToday, one of the biggest streets, and a public fountain in Boleč, are named after him. In February 2014, exactly 210 years after his assassination, his remains were moved into a Boleč churchyard tomb.\n\n"}

She makes appearances at New Age conferences worldwide, has hosted spiritual retreats in Thailand and has released books and audio recordings.\n\nJasmuheen was born in 1957 in New South Wales, Australia of post-war Norwegian migrant parents.\n\nJasmuheen developed financial and business management skills working full-time in the finance industry. In 1992 she began combining her experience in business and finance with meditation, selling access to workshops and seminars on the topic and, by deed poll changed her name to Jasmuheen.\n\nIn 1998, she appeared in her first film, a six-part direct to video documentary called \"The Legend of Atlantis: Return of the Lightmasters\". The Australian television programme \"60 Minutes\" challenged Jasmuheen to demonstrate how she could live without food and water. The supervising medical professional Dr Beres Wenck found that, after 48 hours, Jasmuheen displayed symptoms of acute dehydration, stress, and high blood pressure. Jasmuheen claimed that this was a result of \"polluted air\". On the third day, she was moved to a mountainside retreat about 15 miles from the city, where she was filmed enjoying the fresh air, claiming she could now successfully practice Inedia. But as filming progressed, Jasmuheen's speech slowed, her pupils dilated, and she lost over a stone (6 kg or 14 lb) in weight. After four days, she acknowledged that she had lost weight, but stated that she felt fine. Dr. Wenck stated: \"You are now quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%.\" The doctor continued: \"Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risk if she goes any further is kidney failure.\" Jasmuheen's condition continued to deteriorate rapidly due to acute dehydration, despite her contrary insistence. Dr Wenck concluded that continuing the experiment would ultimately prove fatal. The film crew agreed with this assessment and stopped filming.\n\nRegarding her intake of food, Jasmuheen is quoted by the Correx Archives as saying: \"Generally not much at all. Maybe a few cups of tea and a glass of water, but now and then if I feel a bit bored and I want some flavour, then I will have a mouthful of whatever it is I'm wanting the flavour of. So it might be a piece of chocolate or it might be a mouthful of a cheesecake or something like that.\" In the aftermath of the \"60 Minutes\" broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in \"The Independent\", \"Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster\".\n\nJasmuheen has stated that she has lived on approximately 300 calories per day for the past fourteen years, maintaining full health through supplementing a fluid intake with \"cosmic particles\" or \"micro-food\", which she describes as prana. She has stated that she has not yet mastered the ability to be fluid-free for more than short periods.\n\nJasmuheen was awarded the Bent Spoon Award by Australian Skeptics in 2000 (\"presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle\"). She was also awarded the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize for Literature for her book \"Pranic Nourishment – Living on Light\", \"which explains that although some people do eat food, they don't ever really need to.\"\n\nJasmuheen maintains that some of her beliefs are based on the writings and \"more recent channelled material\" of the Count of St Germain. She states that her DNA expanded from 2 to 12 strands to take up more hydrogen. The extra strands of DNA have not been scientifically verified. When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, Jasmuheen stated \"you cannot view spiritual energy under a microscope\". She claimed that such a challenge would be a deliberate attack on her beliefs, and that she refuses to act as an example of her alleged paranormal attributes.\n\nIn 2005, James Randi offered her the James Randi Educational Foundation US$1 million prize to demonstrate her claims. In 2010, she appeared in the documentaries \"3 Magic Words\" and \"In the Beginning There Was Light\".\n\n, five deaths had been directly linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen's publications. Jasmuheen has denied any responsibility for the deaths.\n\n53-year-old Melbourne resident Lani Marcia Roslyn Morris died in 1999, while attempting the breatharian \"diet\" advocated by Jasmuheen. Jim Vadim Pesnak, 63, and his wife Eugenia, 60, were jailed for six years and two years, respectively, on charges of manslaughter for their involvement in the death of Morris. Pesnak had delayed seeking medical attention. Referring this case, Jasmuheen commented that Morris's practice of Inedia perhaps was \"not coming from a place of integrity and did not have the right motivation\".\n\nJasmuheen offered similar defence in response to the death of Verity Linn, who died of Hypothermia and Dehydration with lack of nutrition while practising Inedia in Scotland, her diary mentioning Jasmuheen's teachings. Linn's body was found in a tent. In 2012, it was reported that a Swiss woman died of starvation after having attempted to survive purely on light, as taught in one of Jasmuheen's books. In 2017 a Dutch woman living in a household of four practitioners of breatharianism inspired by Jasmuheen died under mysterious circumstances. The three remaining members of the household are suspected of withholding the malnourished woman adequate medical care.\n\nJasmuheen has written that \"If you haven't found the light that will nourish you, you may have the intention to become a breatharian, but in fact you may be putting yourself through food deprivation. There is one known case where a person died when trying to become a breatharian.\"\n\nIn 1999, Michelle Shirley, spokeswoman for the Cult Information Centre, told the BBC that the centre had been contacted five times in the previous 12 months by concerned friends and family members of Breatharians and that \"although Breatharianism is not strictly a cult, the centre has been monitoring its activities\". She added, \"We are particularly concerned about any implication that if it doesn't work, it is the person's fault. That implies there is nothing wrong with the Breatharians' teachings.\"\n\n\n"}

According to his own account, Hawes began to see apparitions at the age of twenty after a girlfriend who practiced Reiki manipulated his life force energy. Paranormal researcher John Zaffis told Hawes that he was becoming sensitive to paranormal phenomena. Hawes founded the Rhode Island Paranormal Society (RIPS) in 1990 as a support group for people who had paranormal experiences. When Hawes was twenty-two, Hawes went on to found TAPS/The Atlantic Paranormal Society and co-create the major hit \"Ghost Hunters\". \"Ghost Hunters\" became the flagship show of the Syfy Channel and made it one of the top watched channels on cable.\n\nHawes has written two books on the paranormal and four sci-fi/thriller screenplays. He and fellow TAPS founder Grant Wilson are longtime co-workers at their day job as plumbers for Roto-Rooter. It was Hawes who brought Wilson into the plumbing business. The two are former co-owners of the Spalding Inn, based in Whitefield, New Hampshire.They finally sold the Inn in the summer of 2014.\n\nHawes has used public ghost hunting events and personal appearances to raise money for various charities, such as the Shriners Hospitals for Children and Cure Kids Cancer.\n\nIn March 2005, Barry Clinton Eckstrom, 51, of Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania, began to send threatening e-mails to Jason Hawes, founder of TAPS. Hawes alerted the FBI in Providence. When the e-mails began to include threats against then President George W. Bush, the Secret Service became involved. Eckstrom also used Hawes's name to send e-mails to some female members of TAPS, in which he threatened to rape and murder them. While under surveillance by federal agents, Eckstrom used a Bethel Park, Pennsylvania library computer to send an e-mail in Hawes' name to Roto Rooter's Cincinnati headquarters, threatening to shoot employees there. Next, Eckstrom typed a message threatening to kill President Bush, again in Hawes' name, using the Department of Homeland Security's website. Before he could send the message, he was arrested. Because of these activities, Eckstrom was sentenced to two years in federal prison in January 2006.\n\nHawes has written numerous books.\n\n\n\n"}

She was the widow of anthropologist and sociologist Shyama Charan Dube and a younger sister of the late classical singer Sumati Mutatkar. She is survived by two sons, Mukul Dube and Saurabh Dube. Known for her work on kinship and in women's studies, she wrote several books including \"Matriliny and Islam: religion and society in the Laccadives\" and \"Women and kinship: comparative perspectives on gender in South and South‑east Asia\".\n\nAlthough she had taught earlier at Osmania, Dube's academic career really began in 1960 at Sagar University, Madhya Pradesh. She moved to Delhi in 1975. She played a crucial role in shaping the \"Towards Equality\" report of the Committee on the Status of Women in India (1974), Government of India, discussion of which in the Parliament of India brought women's studies to centre stage in Indian academia via the UGC and the ICSSR.\n\nShe was a key person in the Indian Sociological Society in the 1970s and was responsible for introducing women's studies concerns into mainstream sociology. She was one of the pioneering and senior faculty in the Institute of Rural Management, Anand, when it started functioning in 1980. One of her studies in the then nascent educational organisation put it on the international map. In IRMA she pioneered a course for the first batch in 1980, termed then \"Rural Environment\"; a foundation course which attempted to push a \"business management techniques program design\" towards asking questions about village society. It was also designed as a preparatory course to the \"village field work segment\". This was an innovation for business schools which she pioneered from probably her own sociological field work experiences. This course has been developed further, and split; in 2012, it was offered as three half credit courses, termed \"Rural Society and Polity\", \"Rural Livelihood Systems\", and \"Rural Research Methods\". It continues to be offered as a first semester course, as a preparation for the field work that follows.\n\nAt the World Sociological Congress of 1984, women activists and women's studies scholars played a dominant role through Research Committee (RC) 32. Dube summed up the session with her comments on the tradition of son preference in India. In a debate in the \"Economic and Political Weekly\" in 1982–86 on sex selective abortions, her contribution was noteworthy and her prediction about the direct relationship between deficit of women and increased violence against women proved to be true in later years.\n\nDue to the team effort of women's studies scholars (including Leela Dube), RC 32 was institutionalised in the World Sociological Congress. Dube invited many activists for the 12th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, Zagreb, 24–31 July 1988, to present papers on \"Codification of Customary Laws into Family Laws in Asia\". In the Congress, Dube's speech on feminist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock provided new insights into the departure of feminist anthropologists from the colonial legacy of \"Big Brother watching you\". Power relations between the North and The South in the construction of knowledge and the hegemonic presence of the ETIC approach in academics were questioned by Leacock as well as by Dube, a proponent of the \"dialogical approach\" in anthropological and ethnographic research.\n\nAt different times, Leela Dube was associated with the Indian Council of Social Science Research and the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. For short spells she was visiting faculty at several universities in different parts of the world.\n\nIn keeping with her expressed wish, her eyes were donated after her death.\n\n\"Visibility and Power: Essays on Women in Society and Development\", co-edited by Leela Dube, Eleanor Leacock and Shirley Ardener and published by the Oxford University Press in 1986, provides an international perspective for the anthropology of women in the contexts of India, Iran, Malaysia, Brazil and Yugoslavia.\n\nHer piece, \"On the Construction of Gender: Hindu Girls in Patrilineal India\", \"Economic and Political Weekly\", Vol. 23, No. 18 (Apr. 30, 1988), has been used by women's groups for study circles and training programmes.\n\nA volume in the series on Women and the Household, \"Structures and Strategies: Women, Work, and Family\" (1990), co-edited by Leela Dube and Rajni Palriwala, has been useful in teaching women's studies in Economics, Sociology, Geography, Social Work and Governance courses.\n\n\"Women and Kinship: Comparative Perspectives on Gender in South and South-East Asia\", by Leela Dube, United Nations University Press (1997), argues that kinship systems provide an important context in which gender relations are located in the personal and public arenas.\n\nHer celebrated book, \"Anthropological Explorations in Gender: Intersecting Fields\", published in 2001 by Sage, is an important contribution in feminist anthropology in India. It examines gender, kinship and culture by sourcing a variety of unconventional materials such as folk tales, folk songs, proverbs, legends and myths to construct an ethnographic profile of feminist thought. She provides an understanding of the socialization of the girl child in the patriarchal family, with the \"seed and soil\" theory propagated by Hindu scriptures and epics symbolizing a domination-subordination power relationship between men and women.\n\nHer last publication, a Marathi translation of her last book in English, was \"Manavashastratil Lingbhavachi Shodhamohim\", which appeared in 2009.\n\nIn 2009 she was given the UGC's Swami Pranavananda Saraswati Award for 2005.\n\nIn 2007 she received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Indian Sociological Society.\n"}

{"id": "1999493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999493", "title": "Manifestation of God", "text": "Manifestation of God\n\nThe Manifestation of God is a concept in the Bahá'í Faith that refers to what are commonly called prophets. The Manifestations of God are appearances of the Divine Spirit or Holy Spirit in a series of personages, and as such, they perfectly reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization through the agency of that same Spirit. In the Baha'i Faith, it is believed that the Manifestations of God are the only channel for humanity to know about God because contact with the Spirit is what transforms the heart and mind, creating a living relationship between the soul and God. They act as perfect mirrors reflecting the attributes of God into the physical world. Bahá'í teachings hold that the motive force in all human development is due to the coming of the Manifestations of God. The Manifestations of God are directly linked with the Bahá'í concept of progressive revelation.\n\nThe Bahá'í concept of the intermediary between God and humanity is expressed in the term Manifestation of God. Bahá'ís believe in a single, imperishable God, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose. Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as Manifestations of God. In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are not seen as incarnations of God as God cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures, but they are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of a Manifestation of God emphasizes the simultaneously existing qualities of humanity and divinity. In the station of divinity, they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; in the station of humanity, they show the physical qualities of common man. A common Bahá'í analogy used to explain the relationship between the Manifestation of God and God is that of a perfect mirror. In the analogy, God is likened to the Sun – the source of physical life on earth. The spirit and attributes of God are likened to the rays of the Sun, and the Manifestations of God are likened to perfect mirrors reflecting the rays of the Sun. Thus, the Manifestations of God act as pure mirrors that reflect the attributes of God onto this material world.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are seen to represent a level of existence which is an intermediary between God and humans. Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, explained that at one extreme the Manifestations of God are humble servants of God and at the other extreme they claim to speak with the voice of God, and manifest his attributes to humanity. They may at times emphasize their humanity, and at other times proclaim their divinity. These stations are complementary rather than mutually exclusive.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are believed to possess capacities that do not exist in humans, and this difference is not a difference in degree but a difference in kind. The Manifestations of God are not seen to be simply great thinkers or philosophers who have a better understanding than others, but that, by their nature, they are inherently superior to the average human. Thus, the Manifestations of God are special beings, having a unique relationship to God as they have been sent by God from the spiritual world as an instrument of divine revelation. They are understood to have existed in the spiritual world prior to their physical birth in this life. They are also seen to have innate, divinely revealed knowledge and absolute knowledge of the physical world. According to `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son and successor of the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, the Manifestations of God must be distinguished above any other person in every aspect and qualification, in order that they can effectively train and educate people.\n\nThe purpose of the Manifestation of God, according to Bahá'í belief, is to educate humanity. The Manifestations of God are seen as divine educators, who are raised up by God with the purpose of uplifting mankind and expressing his will. In expressing God's intent, the Manifestations of God are seen to establish religion in the world. Each brings a book and reveals teachings and laws according to the time and place which they appear. Bahá'u'lláh used the term \"revelation\" to describe the phenomena that occurs each time a Manifestation of God appears; he stated that the writings of the Manifestation of God represent the infallible word of God, and because the writings remain after the earthly life of the Manifestation they are a very important part of revelation. The laws and precepts revealed by the Manifestation of God lie in different spheres and levels and include elements intended to help individuals develop a sound character and acquire divine attributes, as well as laws and principles designed to help improve the welfare of society and advance civilization. `Abdu'l-Bahá has stated that from time to time an educator will come to teach humanity, and without these teachings humanity would be overcome by such emotions and attitudes as anger, jealousy and hatred.\n\nThe Bahá'í belief that the primary role of the Manifestation of God is that of an educator is stated by Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá:\n\nIn Bahá'í belief, all of the Manifestations of God are from the same God and have the same spiritual and metaphysical nature, and that there is absolute equality among them. The differences between the various Manifestations of God and their teachings, Bahá'u'lláh explained, are due to the varying needs and capacities of the civilization in which they appeared, and not due to any differences in their level of importance or nature.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are taught to be \"one and the same\", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction. Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the Book of Certitude that in respect to their station of unity \"if thou callest them all by one name and dost ascribe to them the same attribute, thou hast not erred from the truth.\" In this sense, the Manifestations of God all fulfill the same purpose and perform the same function by mediating between God and creation. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual \"return\" of all the previous Manifestations of God.\n\nBahá'u'lláh then states the diversity of the teachings of the Manifestations of God does not come about because of their differences, since they are one and the same, but because they each have a different mission. Bahá'u'lláh writes regarding this station of distinction, \"each Manifestation of God hath a distinct individuality, a definitely prescribed mission, a predestined Revelation, and specially designated limitations.\" Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the Gems of Divine Mysteries that those who perceive distinctions and differences between the Manifestations of God, will notice the underlying unity of the Manifestations once they continue on their spiritual path. Bahá'u'lláh in several passages goes so far as to say that denial of one Manifestation is equivalent to denial of all of them. `Abdu'l-Bahá said that a Bahá'í will choose death over denial of any of the great Prophets, whether Moses, Muhammad or Christ.\n\nThe Bahá'í belief in the oneness of the Manifestations of God does not mean, however, that the same individual soul is born again at different times and in different physical bodies. In the Bahá'í view, the various Manifestations of God were all different personalities and had separate individual realities. Instead, their equality is due to that Manifestation of God manifested and revealed the qualities of God to the same degree.\n\nBahá'u'lláh taught that Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single progressive religion from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress. In the Bahá'í view the succession of Manifestations of God had no beginning and will have no end. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that Manifestations will continue to come about every thousand years, extending \"over many ages into the unborn reaches of time.\"\n\nWhile Manifestations of God are explained to have always come to humanity and will continue to do so, `Abdu'l-Bahá explained that there are distinct cycles within this process. The cycles consist of hundreds of thousands of years and are characterized by three periods. The first period involves the coming of a series of Manifestations of God who prepare humanity for a universal theophany; the second period involves the appearance of the Manifestation of God that brings the universal theophany and his dispensation; finally the third period includes the Manifestations of God that come after. `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that in the current cycle, the first period was started by Adam and extended to the time of the Báb. Bahá'u'lláh is seen as the universal Manifestation of God, and the current cycle will continue for another 500,000 years.\n\nThere is no definitive list of Manifestations of God, but Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá referred to several personages as Manifestations; they include Adam, Noah, Krishna, Moses, Abraham, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad. The Báb, as well as Bahá'u'lláh, were included in this definition. Thus religious history is interpreted as a series of periods or \"dispensations\", where each \"Manifestation\" brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.\n\nBahá'ís do not claim that the Bahá'í revelation is the final stage in God's direction in the course of human spiritual evolution. The Bahá'í writings contain assurances that after 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's coming, another Manifestation of God will appear to advance human civilization.\n\n'Abdu'l-Bahá writes in the \"Tablet of the Universe\" (\"Lawh-i-Aflákiyyih\") that there are infinite Manifestations of God in the infinite worlds of God.\n\nIn the Bahá'í definition, there is a distinction between minor prophets and the Manifestations of God, the major prophets. This distinction is also referred to as lesser/greater, dependent/independent, follower/universal, and other similar phrases. The Manifestations of God or the major prophets are compared to the sun, which produces its own heat and light, and the minor prophets are likened to the moon, which receives its light from the sun.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are described as prophets endowed with constancy. The term endowed with constancy refers to prophets to whom a book was revealed (in which the book contained legislation) and with whom lasting covenants with God were made, abrogating past covenants. For example, Bahá'u'lláh describes Moses as a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet; Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses (Exodus 4:14-17). Furthermore, the other prophets of the Old Testament such as Jeremiah, David, Solomon, Ezekiel, and Isaiah are described as minor prophets as they came in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion. There is, however, no definite list of who is or isn't a minor prophet in the Bahá'í understanding.\n\nThe distinction can also be described as the difference between inspiration and revelation. Revelation is seen to be the direct and infallible perception of God's word and is only accessible to the Manifestations of God who transmit it to humanity. On the other hand, inspiration is seen to be the indirect and relative perception of spiritual truths that each person may have access to. Bahá'u'lláh stated that at times, God chooses ordinary people to act as \"prophets\" and thus inspires them to play certain roles in human affairs; these people however remain ordinary people whose powers of inspiration have been further developed by God.\n\nIt is implied, though not specifically named, that the American continents have had their share of divine revelations, which somewhat have been lost to time except in oral traditions. A quote exists by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:\n\nAcademics are researching Native Messengers and some have connected the signs of a Prophet with the Great Peacemaker of the Haudenosaunee. As such, some Bahá'í's revere the Peacemaker as a Manifestation of God. However, as the Great Peacemaker was never named specifically in the Writings, he cannot be officially listed as a Manifestation of God within the Faith.\n\nIn regards to the Asiatic prophets, Shoghi Effendi wrote:\n\n"}
{"id": "13230367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13230367", "title": "Prussian Lithuanians", "text": "Prussian Lithuanians\n\nThe Prussian Lithuanians, or Lietuvininkai (singular: \"Lietuvininkas\", plural: \"Lietuvininkai\"), are Lithuanians, originally Lithuanian language speakers, who formerly inhabited a territory in northeastern East Prussia called Prussian Lithuania, or Lithuania Minor (, ), instead of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and, later, the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuania Major, or Lithuania proper). Prussian Lithuanians contributed greatly to the development of written Lithuanian, which for a long time was considerably more widespread and in more literary use in Lithuania Minor than in Lithuania proper.\n\nUnlike most Lithuanians, who remained Roman Catholic after the Protestant Reformation, most Lietuvininkai became Lutheran-Protestants (Evangelical-Lutheran).\n\nThere were 121,345 speakers of Lithuanian in the Prussian census of 1890. Almost all Prussian Lithuanians fled or were expelled after World War II, when East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union. The northern part became the Kaliningrad Oblast, while the southern part was attached to Poland. Only the small Klaipėda Region () was attached to Lithuania.\n\nThe term \"Preußische Litauer\" (\"Prussian Lithuanians\" in German) appeared in German texts of the 16th century. The term \"Kleinlitaw\" (\"Lithuania Minor\" in German) was first used by Simon Grunau between 1517 and 1527. Prussian Lithuanians used various names for themselves: Prussians (Lithuanian: \"Prūsai\", German: \"Preusch\"), Prussian Lithuanians (Lithuanian: \"Pruſû Lietuwiai\", \"Pruſû Lietuvininkai\", \"Pruſißki Lietuvininkai\", German: \"Preußische Litauer\"), or simply Lithuanians (Lithuanian: \"Lietuw(i)ni(n)kai\", German: \"Litauer\"). Local self-designating terms found in literature, such as \"Sziszionißkiai\" (\"people from here\"), \"Burai\" (German: \"Bauern\"), were neither politonyms nor ethnonyms. Another similar term appeared in the Klaipėda Region (Memelland) during the interwar years – \"Memellanders\" (Lithuanian: \"Klaipėdiškiai\", German: \"Memelländer\"). Modern Lithuanian historiography uses the term \"Lietuvininkai\" or sometimes a neologism unknown to Lietuwininkai themselves, \"Mažlietuviai\". The usage of \"Lietuvininkai\" is problematic as it is a synonym of the word \"Lietuviai\" (\"Lithuanians\"), and not the name of a separate ethnic sub-group.\n\nFor Prussian Lithuanians loyalty to the German state, strong religious beliefs, and the mother tongue were the three main criteria of self-identification. Due to differences in religion and loyalties to a different state, the Prussian Lithuanians did not consider Lithuanians of the Grand Duchy to be part of their community. They used the exonym Samogitians (, ) to denote Lithuanians of Lithuania Major. As with other closely related groups with differing religions (e.g. Northern Ireland, former Yugoslavia), antagonism was frequent between the Lutheran Prussian Lithuanians and the Catholic Lithuanians of the Grand Duchy, despite the common language. For example, inhabitants of Lithuania did not trust Prussian Lithuanians in the Klaipėda Region and tended to eliminate them from posts in government institutions. When Prussian Lithuanian writer Ieva Simonaitytė (Ewa Simoneit) chose the side of the Lithuanian Republic, she was condemned by relatives, friends and neighbours. Only one Prussian Lithuanian, Dovas Zaunius, worked in the government of Lithuania between World War I and World War II. The antagonism persisted until the end of World War II.\n\nThe territory where Prussian Lithuanians lived in ancient times was inhabited by the Old Prussian, Skalvian and Curonian tribes. The area between the rivers Alle and Neman became almost uninhabited during the 13th-century Prussian Crusade and wars between the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Teutonic Order. This uninhabited area was named \"the wilderness\" in chronicles. Local tribes were resettled, either voluntary or by force, in the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the 1422 Treaty of Melno, a stable border between the two states was established. Better living conditions in the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights attracted many Lithuanians and Samogitians to settle there. Masurians and Curonians began moving into Prussia around the same time.\n\nAfter 1525, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Order Albert became duke of Prussia and converted to Protestantism. Many Prussian Lithuanians also became Protestants. By the will of Albert, church services for Prussian Lithuanians were held in the Lithuanian language. Although Lithuanians who settled in Prussia were mainly farmers, in the 16th century there was an influx of educated Protestant immigrants from Lithuania, such as Martynas Mažvydas, Abraomas Kulvietis and Stanislovas Rapolionis, who became among the first professors at Königsberg University, founded in 1544. Martynas Mažvydas was a zealous Protestant and urged citizens to stop all contact between Prussian Lithuanians and Lithuanians living in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in a bid to curtail Catholic influence in the country.\n\nIn 1708, the Kingdom of Prussia was devastated by plague, especially its easternmost part, where Prussian Lithuanians lived. About 50% of Prussian Lithuanians died. To compensate for the loss, King Frederick II of Prussia invited settlers from Salzburg, the Palatinate, and Nassau to repopulate the area. Many of these Lutherans were members of the Pietism movement, which then spread among Prussian Lithuanians. In 1811 a teacher's seminary for Prussian Lithuanians was established in Karalene near Insterburg, which remained open until 1924. From the mid-18th century, a majority of Prussian Lithuanians were literate; in comparison, the process was much slower in the Grand Duchy.\n\nThe nationalistic Lithuanian national revival in the late 19th century was not popular with Prussian Lithuanians. To them integration with Lithuania was not understandable and not acceptable. The idea of Lithuanian–Latvian unity was more popular than idea of Lithuanian-Prussian Lithuanian unity during the Great Seimas of Vilnius, a conference held in 1905.\n\nThe first Prussian Lithuanian elected to the Reichstag, Jonas Smalakys, was a fierce agitator for the integrity of the German Empire. In 1879, Georg Sauerwein published the poem \"Lietuwininkais esame mes gime\" in the newspaper \"Lietuwißka Ceitunga\". The 7th stanza was dedicated to Wilhelm I, German Emperor.\n\nThere was no national Germanization policy until 1870; Prussian Lithuanians voluntarily adopted German language and culture. After the Unification of Germany in 1871, when part of Lithuania became integrated with the new nation of Germany, learning the German language was made compulsory in state schools. Studying the German language provided the possibility for Prussian Lithuanians to become acquainted with Western European culture and values. However, Germanization also provoked a cultural movement among Prussian Lithuanians. In 1879 and 1896, petitions for the return of the Lithuanian language to schools was signed by 12,330 and 23,058 Prussian Lithuanians from the districts of Memel, Heydekrug, Tilsit and Ragnit. In 1921, the French administration made a survey in the Klaipėda Region that showed that only 2.2% of Prussian Lithuanians would prefer purely Lithuanian schools. The Lithuanian language and culture were not persecuted in Prussia. In contrast, there were restrictive Russification policies and a Lithuanian press ban in the parts of Lithuania that had become part of the Russian Empire. The Prussian Lithuanians could publish own newspapers and books, even helping Lithuanians in Russia to bypass their press ban by publishing their newspapers, such as \"Auszra\" and \"Varpas\".\n\nThe northern part of East Prussia beyond the Neman River was detached from East Prussia at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, dividing the territories inhabited by Prussian Lithuanians between Weimar Germany and the Klaipėda Region (Memelland) under the administration of the Council of Ambassadors, which was formed to enforce the agreements reached in the Treaty of Versailles. The organisation \"Deutsch-Litauischer Heimatbund\" () sought reunification with Germany or to create an independent state of Memelland and had a membership of 30,000 individuals. Two dozen pro-Lithuanian representatives of the Prussian Lithuanian National Council signed the Act of Tilsit, asking to unite the Klaipėda Region with Lithuania; the idea was not supported by the majority of Prussian Lithuanians. World War I was followed by severe economical hardships and inflation in Germany. In 1923, the Republic of Lithuania occupied the Klaipėda Region during the Klaipėda Revolt.\n\nA secret report of 1923 by Jonas Polovinskas-Budrys, a Lithuanian professional counterintelligence officer, shows around 60% of the local inhabitants supported the revolt, 30% were neutral and 10% were against, namely the supporters of a \"freistadt\" status or reunification with Germany. Soon Lithuanian policies alienated the Prussian Lithuanians. People from Greater Lithuania were sent to assume public administration posts in the region. According to the Lithuanian view, the Prussian Lithuanians were Germanized Lithuanians who should be re-Lithuanized. Prussian Lithuanians saw this Lithuanization policy as a threat to their own culture and began to support German political parties, and even started identifying themselves as Germans. During the 1925 census, 37,626 people declared themselves to be Lithuanians and 34,337 people identified themselves as Memellanders, a neologism to distinguish themselves from Lithuanians. Inhabitants of the Klaipėda Region continuously voted for German or German-oriented parties.\n\nNazi Germany invaded Klaipėda after the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania. The inhabitants were allowed to choose Lithuanian citizenship. Only 500 asked for citizenship, and only 20 were awarded it. The reunification of Klaipėda with Germany was met with joy by a majority of inhabitants. About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, fled the region.\n\nAfter the Nazis came to power in 1933, Prussian Lithuanian activists living in Germany were persecuted. In 1938, Prussian and Lithuanian place names in East Prussia were translated into German or replaced by German names often unrelated to the Lithuanian toponym. For example, Lasdehnen (Lazdynai) became Haselberg, Jodlauken (Juodlaukiai) became Schwalbental, and so on. Toponyms of the Klaipėda region were not changed after reunification. The Prussian Lithuanian newspaper \"Naujaſis Tilźes Keleiwis\" was not closed down until 1940. during World War II. Church services in Tilsit and Ragnit were held in the Lithuanian language until the evacuation of East Prussia in late 1944.\n\nThe evacuation started late; the Red Army approached much faster than expected and cut off the territorial connection with other German-held territories by January 26, 1945. Many refugees perished due to Soviet low-flying strafing attacks on the civilians columns, or the extreme cold. However, many managed to flee by land or sea into those parts of Germany captured by the British and Americans. Among the latter were the pastors A. Keleris, J. Pauperas, M. Preikšaitis, O. Stanaitis, A. Trakis, and J. Urdse, who gathered those from the Lithuanian parishes and reorganised the Lithuanian church in the western zones of Allied-occupied Germany.\n\nThe Red Army made no distinction between Germans of Prussian Lithuanian or German ethnicity. During the evacuation of East Prussia, Prussian Lithuanians, like other East Prussians, fled in an attempt to escape. Mass murder, rape, and looting were the common fate of those who did not succeed. After the end of war, some Prussian Lithuanians tried to return to their East Prussian homes, but they were discriminated against and denied food rations by the Soviets.\n\nAll who remained at the war's end were expelled from Soviet's Kaliningrad Oblast and from the former Klaipėda Region, which was transferred to the Lithuanian SSR in 1947. By 1945, there were only about 20,000 inhabitants left in the Klaipėda Region, compared to the 152,800 in 1939. The government of the Lithuanian SSR followed Soviet policy and viewed the Prussian Lithuanians as Germanized Lithuanians. About 8,000 persons were repatriated from DP camps during 1945–50. However, their homes and farms were not returned as either Russians or Lithuanians had already occupied their property. Prussians who remained in the former Memel (Klaipėda) territory were fired from their jobs and otherwise discriminated against. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some Prussian Lithuanians and their descendants did not regain lost property in the Klaipėda region.\n\nIn 1951 about 3,500 people from the former Memel Territory were expelled by the authority of the Lithuanian SSR to East Germany. After Konrad Adenauer's visit to Moscow in 1958, the former citizens of Germany were allowed to emigrate, and the majority of Prussian Lithuanians in the Lithuanian SSR emigrated to West Germany. Only about 2,000 local Lithuanians chose to remain in the Klaipėda Region and virtually none in the Kaliningrad Oblast. The majority of Prussian Lithuanians today live in the Federal Republic of Germany. Together with 65,000 refugees from Lithuania proper, mostly Roman Catholic, who made their way to the western occupation zones of Germany, by 1948 they had founded 158 schools in the Lithuanian language.\n\nDue to the emigration of many Lithuanians overseas and the assimilation of the remaining Prussian Lithuanians in Germany, the number of Lithuanian schools has now dwindled to only one, in Lampertheim in Hesse. Until 1990, this secondary boarding school was the only Lithuanian school outside areas controlled by the Soviet Union. It was attended by several well-known exiled Lithuanians, such as the singer Lena Valaitis.\n\nCommunities of Prussian Lithuanians have developed in Canada, the United States, Sweden and Australia. However, a separate ethnic and cultural identity for Prussian Lithuanians is not as strong as it once was, and cultural differences are gradually vanishing.\n\nThe Prussian Lithuanians that settled in the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights over the centuries were influenced by German culture and the German language. They adopted the cultural values and social conventions of the German state, but preserved their Lithuanian language, traditions and folk culture. For centuries Prussian Lithuanians lived in a political and religious environment that was different from that of other Lithuanians and evolved into a separate ethnic group. The common state united some aspects of, traditions and folk culture. who viewed its rulers as their own rulers. Hanging portraits of the rulers of the House of Hohenzollern in the home was widespread.\n\nThe Pietist congregational movement attracted large numbers of Prussian Lithuanians: evangelical fellowships (, ) were very active in Prussia, as they were in the rest of the German Empire. About 40% of Lithuanians belonged to such fellowships, whose members lived by ascetic principles.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century Prussian Lithuanians were mostly villagers. Their feudal mentality is reflected in the poem \"The Seasons\" by Kristijonas Donelaitis. \"The Seasons\" criticizes the tendency to adopt German ways, since this was often associated with decadent noblemen. Donelaitis called for Lithuanians to do their duty, to not envy those who went to town, to not complain or be lazy, and try to work as much as was needed to be a good peasant:\n\nTowns were not large. People who emigrated to the major towns, Königsberg and Memel, usually became bilingual and eventually became Germanized.\n\nAfter World War II, virtually no Prussian Lithuanians remained in Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast and only a small number survived in the Lithuanian SSR. Their peasant culture, first threatened by germanization in the German Empire and politically oppressed in the Nazi era, was now completely wiped out by the Soviets, who made no distinction between Germans and Lithuanians. The situation was somewhat better in the former Memel Territory but even there churches and cemeteries were destroyed.\n\nPrussian Lithuanian surnames often consist of a patronymic with suffixes \"\"-eit\" and \"-at\". It has the same role as the English suffix \"-son\" in the surnames \"Abrahamson\" and \"Johnson\". Examples include: \"Abromeit, Grigoleit, Jakeit, Wowereit, Kukulat, Szameitat\".\n\nAnother type of Prussian Lithuanian surname use the suffixes \"-ies\" or \"-us\": \"Kairies, Resgies, Baltßus, Karallus\".\n\nA difference existed between female and male surnames in everyday speech. For example, while officially the wife of Kurschat (Prussian Lithuanian \"Kurßaitis\" or \"Kurßatis\") was also called Kurschat, in the Prussian Lithuanian language special forms were used in speech: the form of a wife's surname was Kurßaitê / Kurßatė and the form of an unmarried woman was Kurßaitikê / Kurßaitukê.\n\nSince the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, Prussian Lithuanians have typically been bilingual.\n\nThe German language used by Prussian Lithuanians belongs to the Low Prussian dialect of Low German, Mundart des Ostgebietes subdialect.\n\nThe Lithuanian language of Prussian Lithuanians could be divided into two main dialects: Samogitian dialect and Aukštaitian dialect. The standard Prussian Lithuanian language is quite similar to standard Lithuanian except for the number of German loanwords. The Lithuanian language which was spoken in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was influenced by Polish and Ruthenian, while in Prussia it was influenced more heavily by the German language. Thus, while Lithuanians used Slavic loanwords and translations, Prussian Lithuanians used German loanwords and translations, and some Slavic loanwords.\n\nLiterature in the Lithuanian language appeared earlier in the Duchy of Prussia than in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The first book in Lithuanian was published in Königsberg in 1547 by Martynas Mažvydas, an émigré from Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while the first Lithuanian book in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was printed in 1596 by Mikalojus Daukša. Many other authors who wrote in Lithuanian were not Prussian Lithuanians, but local Prussian Germans: Michael Märlin, Jakob Quandt, Wilhelm Martinius, Gottfried Ostermeyer, Sigfried Ostermeyer, Daniel Klein, Andrew Krause, Philipp Ruhig, Matttheus Praetorius, Christian Mielcke, Adam Schimmelpfennig, for example. The first major Lithuanian poet, Kristijonas Donelaitis, was from East Prussia and reflected the Prussian Lithuanian lifestyle in his works. The first newspaper in the Lithuanian language, \"Nuſidawimai apie Ewangēliôs Praſiplatinima tarp Źydû ir Pagonû\", was published by Prussian Lithuanians. Prior to World War I, the government and political parties financed the Prussian Lithuanian press.\n\nThe Prussian Lithuanian orthography was based on the German style, while in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania it was primarily based on the Polish style. Prussian Lithuanians used Gothic script. Lithuanians did not read Prussian Lithuanian publications and vice versa; the cultural communication was very limited. Attempts to create a unified newspaper and common orthography for all Lithuanian speakers at the beginning of the 20th century were unsuccessful. After 1905, modern Lithuanian orthography was standardized while Prussian Lithuanian orthography remained the same – German Gothic script, a noun was begun with a capital letter, the letters ſ, ß, ʒ were used, and the construction of sentences was different from Lithuanian.\n\nBooks and newspapers that were published in Lithuania in Roman type were reprinted in Gothic script in Memel Territory in 1923-39. The Prussian Lithuanian newspaper \"Naujaſis Tilźes Keleiwis\" () was published in Tilsit in Gothic style until 1940, when it was closed by the Nazis.\n\n\n\n"}

He spent eight years in prison and nearly another decade trying to clear his name, before being found not guilty in a retrial on April 22, 2008.\n\nIn 1990, Baltovich graduated with a degree in psychology and history from the University of Toronto at Scarborough. There he met fellow student Elizabeth Bain and a relationship developed.\nBain disappeared on June 19, 1990 after telling her mother she was going to \"check the tennis schedule\" on campus. On June 22, her car was found with a large bloodstain in the back seat. Her body was never found.\n\nOn November 19, 1990, Baltovich was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. His case continued in the courts for several years, during which he consistently maintained his innocence. His lawyers suggested that the so-called \"Scarborough rapist\" (the term used for the then unidentified serial killer Paul Bernardo) might be responsible for the murder.\n\nOn March 31, 1992, Baltovich was convicted of second-degree murder. His lawyers appealed and on March 31, 2000, Baltovich was released on bail, pending the outcome of his appeal. In September 2004 his appeal was finally processed; once more his case gained national attention when his lawyers alleged that he had been wrongfully convicted and that Bernardo was guilty of Bain's murder. They pointed to circumstantial evidence suggesting links to Bernardo, evidence not available during Baltovich's original trial because Bernardo's identity as the \"Scarborough rapist\" was then unknown. Asked about the matter, Bernardo denied involvement in Bain's disappearance.\n\nOn December 2, 2004, the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the conviction, delivering what news reports called \"a scathing attack\" on the conduct of the original trial judge. This fell short of the acquittal that Baltovich's counsel had argued for. On July 15, 2005, Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney-General announced that Baltovich would face a new trial on charges of second-degree murder, at an unspecified date, and remain free on bail in the meantime. During that time, Baltovich worked as a librarian for the Government of Ontario.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, jury selection began in the second-degree murder trial. The trial, slated to begin in Toronto on April 14, 2008, was delayed, with the Crown (prosecution) giving no reason. When the trial resumed, the Crown declined to call any of the more than 50 witnesses they had planned, citing \"recent developments, including the cumulative effect of the pre-trial evidentiary rulings rendered to date in this case, other evidentiary issues, and changes to case law\". With no Crown case, the judge directed the jury to make a finding of not guilty on April 22, 2008.\n\nIn January 2010, the Attorney-General concluded that the payment of financial compensation was not appropriate.\n\nOn April 21, 2010, a civil suit alleging malicious prosecution, negligent investigation and negligent representation was filed on behalf of Baltovich. The defendants named include John McMahon, now a judge with the Superior Court of Ontario, and Paul Amenta, a practicing Crown Attorney in Toronto. Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould and Det. Sgt. Steve Reesor, the two lead detectives in the case, are also named as defendants.\n\nIn May 2014, Baltovich's lawyers applied to amend his statement of claim. Media reported that during examinations for discovery related to Baltovich's civil suit, previously undisclosed forensic evidence had surfaced indicating that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould had met with two forensic experts three days after Baltovich's arrest in November 1990 during which time he was told that the police theory of the crime - that Baltovich had killed Elizabeth Bain on June 19, 1990, hidden her body nearby in Colonel Danforth Park and that he had returned three days later to retrieve her body and drive it out of Scarborough in her car - was not supported by the forensic evidence found in Bain's car and that, according to Baltovich's lawyers, the theory presented at Baltovich's first trial was \"flawed and untenable.\" It is also alleged that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould doctored his notes in an effort to conceal the existence of the meeting by removing pages referencing the meeting and replacing them with another page from his notes from a later date.\n\n\n"}

The Book of Mormon also mentions Jacob, and Joseph, two additional sons born to Lehi after his departure from Jerusalem, but does not explicitly name Sariah as their mother, though no other wife of Lehi is ever named. 1 Nephi 18:19 does make it fairly certain that sariah is their mother. She traveled with her husband from Jerusalem, into the wilderness, and eventually, across the ocean to the \"promised land\" (the Americas). She is perhaps best known for the story in First Nephi where she complains against her husband for sending her sons back to Jerusalem. She becomes convinced that they have perished in the desert, but is overjoyed upon their eventual return. In Lehi's vision of the tree of life, Sariah eats the precious fruit, symbolizing that she is righteous and will be saved.\n\nAs the wife of Lehi, and the mother of Nephi and Laman (who went on to establish the nations of the Nephites and the Lamanites), Sariah can be considered one of the principal ancestors of the \"Book of Mormon\" people.

{"id": "693232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=693232", "title": "Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet", "text": "Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet\n\nSir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet KCH FRS (20 May 1772 – 16 May 1828) was an English inventor and rocket artillery pioneer distinguished for his development and deployment of Congreve rockets, and a Tory Member of Parliament (MP).\n\nHe was son of Lt. General Sir William Congreve, 1st Baronet, the Comptroller of the Royal Laboratories at the Royal Arsenal and raised in Kent, England. He was educated at Newcome's school in Hackney, Wolverhampton Grammar School and Singlewell School in Kent. He then studied law at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1793 and MA in 1796. In 1814 he succeeded his father as second Baronet Congreve.\n\nIn 1803 he was a volunteer in the London and Westminster Light Horse, and was a London businessman who published a polemical newspaper, the \"Royal Standard and Political Register\", which was Tory, pro-government and anti-Cobbett. Following a damaging libel action against it in 1804, Congreve withdrew from publishing and applied himself to inventing. Many years previously, several unsuccessful experiments had been made at the Royal Laboratory in Woolwich by Lt. General Thomas Desaguliers. In 1804, at his own expense, began experimenting with rockets at Woolwich.\n\nCongreve was awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Hanoverian army's artillery in 1811, and was often referred to as \"Colonel Congreve\", later made major general in the same army. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March that year. He was also awarded the Order of St. George following the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 and 1816 he was made Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH). In 1821 he was awarded the Order of the Sword by the King of Sweden.\n\nHe enjoyed the friendship of the Prince Regent, in whose household he served as an equerry from 1811, carrying on the service when the Prince, who supported his rocket projects, became King George IV in 1820.\n\nEarlier in 1812 he offered to contest for Parliament the borough of Liverpool but withdrew before polling for lack of support. He entered Parliament later that year when he was nominated as MP for the rotten borough of Gatton in 1812, but withdrew at the next elections in 1814 in favour of the son of the borough's proprietor Sir Mark Wood. In 1818 he was returned as Member for Plymouth, a seat he held until his death.\n\nAfter living with a mistress and fathering two illegitimate sons, he married in December 1824, at Wessel, Prussia, Isabella Carvalho (or Charlotte), a young woman of Portuguese descent and widow of Henry Nisbett McEvoy. They had two sons and a daughter.\n\nIn later years he became a businessman and was chairman of the Equitable Loan Bank, director of the Arigna Iron and Coal Company, the Palladium Insurance Company and the Peruvian Mining Company. After a major fraud case began against him in 1826 in connection with the Arigna company, he fled to France, where he was taken seriously ill. He was prosecuted in his absence, the Lord Chancellor ultimately ruling, just before Congreve's death, that the transaction was 'clearly fraudlent' and designed to profit Congreve and others.\n\nHe died in Toulouse, France, in May 1828, aged 55, and was buried there in the Protestant and Jewish cemetery of Chemin du Béarnais.\n\nMysorean rockets were the first iron-cased rockets that were successfully deployed for military use. Hyder Ali, the 18th century ruler of Mysore and his son and successor Tipu Sultan used them effectively against the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, beginning in 1780 with the Battle of Pollilur (1780).\n\nIn battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\n\nThe Indian rocket experiences, mentioned in Munro's book of 1789, eventually led to the Royal Arsenal beginning a military rocket R&D program in 1801. Several rocket cases were collected from Mysore and sent to Britain for analysis. The development was chiefly the work of William Congreve, who set up a research and development programme at the Woolwich Arsenal's laboratory. After development work was complete the rockets were manufactured in quantity further north, near Waltham Abbey, Essex. He was told that \"the British at Seringapatam had suffered more from the rockets than from the shells or any other weapon used by the enemy.\" \"In at least one instance\", an eye-witness told Congreve, \"a single rocket had killed three men and badly wounded others.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that Congreve may have adapted iron-cased gunpowder rockets for use by the British military from prototypes created by the Irish nationalist Robert Emmet during Emmet's Rebellion in 1803. But this seems far less likely given the fact that the British had been exposed to Indian rockets since 1780 at the latest, and that a vast quantity of unused rockets and their construction equipment fell into British hands at the end of the Anglo-Mysore Wars in 1799, 4 years before Emmet's rockets.\n\nCongreve first demonstrated solid fuel rockets at the Royal Arsenal in 1805. He considered his work sufficiently advanced to engage in two Royal Navy attacks on the French fleet at Boulogne, France, one that year and one the next. In 1807 Congreve and sixteen Ordnance Department civilian employees were present at the Bombardment of Copenhagen, during which 300 rockets contributed to the conflagration of the city.\n\nCongreve rockets were successfully used for the remainder of the Napoleonic Wars, with the most celebrated employment of the weapon being at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. The \"rockets' red glare\" in the American national anthem describes their firing at Fort McHenry during the War of 1812. In January 1814 the Royal Artillery absorbed the various companies armed with rockets into two Rocket Troops within the Royal Horse Artillery. They remained in the arsenal of the United Kingdom until the 1850s. Congreve organized the impressive firework displays in London for the peace of 1814 and for the coronation of George IV in 1821.\n\nBesides his rockets, Congreve was a prolific (if indifferently successful) inventor for the remainder of his life. Congreve invented a gun-recoil mounting, a time-fuze, a rocket parachute attachment, a hydropneumatic canal lock (installed at Hampstead Road Lock, north London) and sluice (1813), a perpetual motion machine, a process of colour printing (1821) which was widely used in Germany, a new form of steam engine, and a method of consuming smoke (which was applied at the Royal Laboratory). He also took out patents for a clock in which time was measured by a ball rolling along a zig-zag track on an inclined plane; for protecting buildings against fire; inlaying and combining metals; unforgeable bank note paper; a method of killing whales by means of rockets; improvements in the manufacture of gunpowder; stereotype plates; fireworks; and gas meters. Congreve was named as comptroller of the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich from 1814 until his death. (Congreve's father Sir William Congreve had also held the same post.)\n\nCongreve's unsuccessful perpetual motion scheme involved an endless band which should raise more water by its capillary action on one side than on the other. He used capillary action of fluids that would disobey the law of never rising above their own level, so to produce a continual ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed, and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. The capillary action raised the water, whereas the same thing could not happen in the part, since the weights would squeeze the water out. Hence, it was heavier than the other; but as \"we know that if it were the same weight, there would be equilibrium, if the heavy chain be also uniform\". Therefore, the extra weight of it would cause the chain to move round in the direction of the arrow, and this would go on, supposedly, continually.\n\nIn 1804 Congreve published \"A concise account of the origin and progress of the rocket system\". Publication of \"A Concise Account of the Origin and Progress of the Rocket System\" by William Congreve was in 1807. In 1814 Congreve published \"The details of the rocket system\". In 1827 \"The Congreve Rocket System\" was published in London. His other publications were: \"An Elementary Treatise on the Mounting of Naval Ordnance\" (1812); \"A Description of the Hydropneumatical Lock\" (1815); \"A New Principle of Steam-Engine\" (1819); \"Resumption of Cash Payments\" (1819) and \"Systems of Currency\" (1819).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "517620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517620", "title": "Tom Seaver", "text": "Tom Seaver\n\nGeorge Thomas Seaver (born November 17, 1944), nicknamed Tom Terrific and The Franchise, is a retired Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He pitched from 1967 to 1986 for four teams, but is noted primarily for his time with the New York Mets and especially for his important role in the team's 1969 World Championship. During a 20-year career, Seaver compiled 311 wins, 3,640 strikeouts, 61 shutouts and a 2.86 earned run average. In , he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the highest percentage of votes ever recorded at the time (98.84%; subsequently surpassed in 2016 by Ken Griffey Jr. with 99.32%), and is one of two players (with Mike Piazza) wearing a New York Mets hat on his plaque in the Hall of Fame. As of 2016, Seaver, Mike Piazza and Gil Hodges (who played for the expansion Mets in 1962–63) are the only Mets players to have their jersey numbers retired by the team (Hodges' number was retired as a manager even though he also played for the Mets).\n\nHe won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 1967, and he received three NL Cy Young Awards as the league's best pitcher. Seaver is the Mets' all-time leader in wins, and he is considered by many baseball experts to be one of the best starting pitchers in the history of baseball.\n\nSeaver was born in Fresno, California, to Betty Lee (Cline) and Charles Henry Seaver. Pitching for Fresno High School, Seaver compensated for his lack of size and strength by developing great control on the mound. Despite being an All-City basketball player, he hoped to play baseball in college.\n\nHe joined the United States Marine Corps Reserves on June 28, 1962. He served with AIRFMFPAC 29 Palms, California through July . After six months of active duty in the Reserves, Seaver enrolled at Fresno City College.\n\nIn anticipation of the following season, he was recruited to pitch for the University of Southern California by legendary Trojan coach Rod Dedeaux. Unsure as to whether Seaver was worthy of a scholarship, he was sent to pitch for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1964. After a stellar season – in which he pitched and won a game in the national tournament with a grand slam – he was awarded a scholarship to USC. As a sophomore, Seaver posted a 10–2 record, and he was drafted in the tenth round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. When Seaver asked for $70,000, however, the Dodgers passed.\n\nIn 1966, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Braves, who had drafted him in the first round of the secondary June draft (20th overall). However, the contract was voided by Baseball Commissioner William Eckert because his college team had played two exhibition games that year (although Seaver himself hadn't played). Seaver intended, then, to finish the college season, but because he had signed a pro contract, the NCAA ruled him ineligible. After Seaver's father complained to Eckert about the unfairness of the situation, and threatened with a lawsuit, Eckert ruled that other teams could match the Braves' offer. The Mets were subsequently awarded his signing rights in a lottery drawing among the three teams (the Philadelphia Phillies and Cleveland Indians being the two others) that were willing to match the Braves' terms.\n\nSeaver spent one season with the Jacksonville Suns of the International League, then joined the New York Mets in 1967. He won 16 games for the last-place Mets, with 18 complete games, 170 strikeouts, and a 2.76 ERA, all Mets records to that point, and was named the National League Rookie of the Year. He was also named to the 1967 All-Star Game, and got the save by pitching a scoreless 15th inning. In , he won 16 games again, and recorded over 200 strikeouts for the first of nine consecutive seasons, but the Mets moved up only one spot in the standings, to ninth.\n\nIn , Seaver and the Mets won their first World Series championship. Seaver won a league-high 25 games and his first National League Cy Young Award. He also finished runner-up to Willie McCovey for the League's Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nIn front of a crowd of over 59,000 at New York's Shea Stadium on July 9, Seaver threw perfect innings against the division-leading Chicago Cubs. Rookie backup outfielder Jimmy Qualls broke up Seaver's bid for a perfect game when he lined a clean single to left field.\n\nIn the first-ever NLCS game, Seaver outlasted Atlanta's Phil Niekro for a sloppy 9-5 victory. Seaver was also the starter for the Mets' first World Series game, but lost a 4-1 decision to the Baltimore Orioles' Mike Cuellar. Seaver then pitched a 10-inning complete game for a 2-1 win in Game Four to put the Mets on the cusp of their first championship.\n\nAt year's end, Seaver was presented with the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year and \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine's \"Sportsman of the Year\" award.\n\nOn April 22, , Seaver set a major league record by striking out the final 10 batters of the game in a 2-1 victory over the San Diego Padres at Shea Stadium. Al Ferrara, who had homered in the second inning for the Padres' run, was the final strikeout victim of the game. In addition to his 10 consecutive strikeouts, Seaver tied Steve Carlton's major league record, at the time, with 19 strikeouts in a nine-inning game. The Mets also won the game in which Carlton struck out 19, with Carlton victimized by Ron Swoboda's pair of 2-run homers in a 4–3 Mets victory in St. Louis on September 15, 1969. (The record was later eclipsed by 20-strikeout games by Kerry Wood, Randy Johnson, Max Scherzer, and twice by Roger Clemens.) By mid-August, Seaver's record stood at 17-6 and he seemed well on his way to a second consecutive 20-victory season. But he only won one of his last ten starts, including four on short rest, to finish 18-12. Nonetheless, Seaver led the National League in both ERA and strikeouts.\nThe season was arguably Seaver's finest year, when he led the league in ERA (1.76) and strikeouts (289 in 286 innings) while going 20–10. However, he finished second in the Cy Young balloting to Ferguson Jenkins of the Chicago Cubs, due to Jenkins' league-leading 24 wins, 325 innings pitched, and exceptional control numbers. Seaver himself has said that 1971 was his best season.\n\nSeaver had four more twenty-win seasons (20 in , 21 in , 22 in 1975, and 21 in ) (7 wins for the Mets, then 14 more after being traded to the Reds). He won two more Cy Young Awards ( and 1975, both with the Mets).\n\nDuring his tenure with the Mets, Seaver made 108 starts in which he pitched 9 or more innings and allowed 1 run or less. His record in those starts is 93-3 with 12 no-decisions. In seven of the 12 no-decisions, he pitched 10 or more innings. In the 12 no-decisions, he pitched a total of 117 innings, allowing 56 hits and 5 earned runs, compiling a 0.38 ERA.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1976, Seaver led the National League in strikeouts five of the seven seasons, finishing second in and third in . Seaver also won three ERA titles as a Met. Two famous quotes about Seaver are attributed to Reggie Jackson: \"Blind men come to the park just to hear him pitch.\" The second was that, while pitching for the Mets during the 1973 World series, 6th game, with the Mets up 3 games to 2, and so poised to win their second Championship, with Mr. Seaver scheduled to start. He did, but did not have his \"arm\" that day, his arm strength, that is, and the opposing team knew it. Seaver would go on to start and lose the 6th game... Mr. Jackson is reported to have said \"Seaver pitched with his heart that day.\" Seaver was perhaps the foremost latter-day exponent of \"drop and drive\" overhand delivery, but his powerful legs protected his arm, and ensured his longevity. Seaver was frequently compared to fellow Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson.\n\nBy 1977, free agency had begun and contract negotiations between Mets ownership and Seaver were not going well. Seaver wanted to renegotiate his contract to bring his salary in line with what other top pitchers were making, but chairman of the board M. Donald Grant, who by this time had been given carte blanche by Met management to do what he wished, refused to budge. Longtime \"New York Daily News\" columnist Dick Young regularly wrote negative columns about Seaver's \"greedy\" demands. As for Seaver, he attempted to resolve the impasse by going to then-team owner Lorinda de Roulet, who along with then-GM Joe McDonald, had negotiated in principle a three-year contract extension by mid-June. But before the contract could be signed, Young wrote an unattributed story in the Daily News claiming that Seaver was being goaded by his wife to ask for more money because she was jealous of the fact that Nolan Ryan was making more money with the California Angels. Upon being informed of the story, Seaver informed de Roulet that he immediately wanted out, and asked McDonald to immediately trade him, feeling that he could not co-exist with M. Donald Grant.\n\nIn one of two trades that New York's sports reporters dubbed \"the Midnight Massacre\" (the other involved struggling outfielder Dave Kingman), Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on June 15, (the trading deadline for that year) for pitcher Pat Zachry, minor league outfielder Steve Henderson, infielder Doug Flynn, and minor league outfielder Dan Norman. Seaver would go 14-3 with Cincinnati and win 21 games that season, including an emotional 5-1 win over the Mets in his return to Shea Stadium. Seaver struck out 11 in the return, and also hit a double. Seaver, who was immensely popular in New York, also received a lengthy ovation at the 1977 All-Star Game, which was held in New York's Yankee Stadium. His departure from New York sparked sustained negative fan reaction, as the Mets became the league's worst team, finishing in last place the next 3 seasons. Combined with the Yankees' resurgence in the market, attendance dipped in , and plunged in to 9,740 per game. M. Donald Grant was fired after the 1978 season, and Joe McDonald was fired after the 1979 season following a sale of the team to publishing magnate Nelson Doubleday, Jr.. In a sardonic nod to the general manager, Shea Stadium acquired the nickname \"Grant's Tomb\".\n\nAfter having thrown five one-hitters for the Mets, including two games in which no-hit bids were broken up in the ninth inning, Seaver recorded a 4-0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 16, 1978 at Riverfront Stadium. It was the only no-hitter of his professional career.\n\nSeaver was 75-46 in Cincinnati. He led the Cincinnati pitching staff in 1979, when the Reds won the Western Division, and again in the strike-shortened 1981 season, when the Reds had the best record in the major leagues. In the latter season, Seaver, with his sterling 14-2 performance, was a close runner-up to Fernando Valenzuela for the Cy Young Award. (Seaver had finished third and fourth in two other previous years.) In 1981, during one of his 2 losses, Seaver recorded his 3,000th strikeout. After recording his 3000th, he took himself out of the game, walking off the mound to a standing ovation. He suffered through an injury-ridden campaign, finishing 5-13.\n\nOn December 16, 1982, Seaver was traded back to the Mets, for Charlie Puleo, Lloyd McClendon, and Jason Felice. On April 5, , he tied Walter Johnson's major league record of 14 Opening Day starts, shutting out the Philadelphia Phillies for six innings in a 2-0 Mets win. (He made two more such starts with the Chicago White Sox in and for a record total of 16 opening day assignments.) Despite a 9-14 record that season, Seaver had high expectations going into and intended to finish his career where he started it.\n\nSeaver and the Mets were stunned on January 20, 1984 when he was claimed in a free-agent compensation draft by the Chicago White Sox. The team (especially GM Frank Cashen) had incorrectly assumed that no one would pursue a high-salaried, 39-year-old starting pitcher, and left him off the protected list. Faced with either reporting to the White Sox or retiring, Seaver chose the former. The result for the Mets was an opening in the starting rotation that allowed Dwight Gooden to be part of the team.\n\nSeaver pitched two and a half seasons in Chicago and recorded his last shutout on July 19, 1985 against the visiting Indians. In an anomaly, Seaver won two games on May 9, 1984; he pitched the 25th and final inning of a game suspended the day before, picking up the win in relief against the Milwaukee Brewers, before starting and winning the day's regularly scheduled game, also facing the Brewers.\n\nAfter Seaver's 298th win, a reporter had pointed out to White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk that following his upcoming start in Boston, Seaver's next scheduled start would be in New York, and that the possibility existed that he might achieve the mark there. Fisk emphatically stated that Seaver \"would\" win in Boston, and then \"would\" win his 300th.\n\nOn August 4, 1985, Seaver recorded his 300th victory at Yankee Stadium against the Yankees, throwing a complete game 4-1 victory. Don Baylor was the tying run at the plate; he hit a fly ball to left field for the final out of the game. Coincidentally, it was Phil Rizzuto Day – Seaver would later become Rizzuto's broadcast partner for Yankee games. Lindsey Nelson, a Mets radio and TV announcer during Seaver's Mets days, called the final out for Yankees TV flagship WPIX.\n\nLate in 1985, his next-to-last season, Seaver almost returned to the Mets, as general manager Frank Cashen was poised to make a late-season trade. However, manager Davey Johnson vetoed the idea, and Seaver instead ended his career with the Boston Red Sox in 1986 after being traded for Steve Lyons in mid-season. Seaver's 311th and last win came on August 18, 1986 against the Minnesota Twins. At the time of his retirement, Seaver was third on the all-time strikeout list (3,640), trailing only Nolan Ryan and Steve Carlton. No major league pitcher has ever matched his feat of striking out ten consecutive batters. His career average of 6.85 strikeouts per nine innings is fourth only to Steve Carlton (7.1), Nolan Ryan (9.55), and Randy Johnson (10.6) of any Hall of Famer with at least 300 wins. Seaver's lifetime ERA of 2.86 was third among starting pitchers in the live-ball era, behind only Whitey Ford (2.73) and Sandy Koufax (2.76). (Jim Palmer and Andy Messersmith both have a career earned run average of 2.86 as well.) Seaver also holds the record for consecutive 200-strike-out seasons with nine (1968–1976). Seaver's 61 career shutouts are second only to Warren Spahn (63) in the live-ball era. His career win-loss record percentage of .603 is one of the highest of any Hall of Fame pitcher with 300 wins in the live-ball era, and his record of 7.84 hits per nine innings is second only to Nolan Ryan (6.56) for all Hall of Fame pitchers with at least three hundred wins, and first among all HOF pitchers in any era with 300 wins, 3000 strikeouts, and a winning percentage of .600 or better. A knee injury prevented him from appearing against the Mets in the 1986 World Series between the Mets and Red Sox, but Seaver received among the loudest ovations during player introductions prior to Game 1. Roger Clemens attributes the time he shared with Seaver as 1986 Red Sox teammates as instrumental in helping him make the transition from thrower to pitcher. The Red Sox did not offer Seaver a contract to his liking for the season. His 1986 salary was $1 million; the Red Sox offered $500,000, which Seaver declined. When no new contract agreement was reached, Seaver was granted free agency on November 12, 1986.\n\nIn 1987, the Mets starting rotation was decimated by injury and they sought help from Seaver. Though no actual contract was signed, Seaver joined the club on June 6, and was hit hard in an exhibition game against the Triple-A Tidewater Tides on June 11. After similar poor outings on the 16th & 20th, he announced his retirement, saying, \"I've used up all the competitive pitches in my arm!\" The Mets retired his uniform number 41 in in a special Tom Seaver Day ceremony. As of 2017, Seaver and Mike Piazza remain the only Met players to have their uniform numbers retired. Casey Stengel and Gil Hodges had their numbers retired as Met managers, and Jackie Robinson had his number retired by all teams. Their numbers—14 (Hodges), 31 (Piazza), 37 (Stengel), 41 (Seaver), and 42 (Jackie Robinson)—were posted in large numerals on the outfield fence at Shea Stadium (except Piazza, whose number 31 was retired in 2016), and are posted on the left field corner overhang at Citi Field. He is one of only two pitchers (the other being Walter Johnson) to have 300 wins, 3,000 strikeouts, and an under 3.00 ERA.\n\nSeaver was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on January 7, 1992. At the time he received the highest percentage of votes with 98.84% (on 425 of 430). Ken Griffey Jr. had 437 of 440, which got him a 99.3%, which superseded both Seaver's vote total and percentage. It leaves both men higher than the likes of Nolan Ryan's 98.79% (491 of 497), and Ty Cobb's 98.23% (222 of 226), among all others. Three of the five ballots that had omitted Seaver were blank, cast by writers protesting the Hall's decision to make Pete Rose ineligible for consideration. One ballot was sent by a writer who was recovering from open-heart surgery and failed to notice Seaver's name. The fifth \"no\" vote was cast by a writer who said he never voted for any player in their first year of eligibility. Seaver is one of two players enshrined in the Hall of Fame with a Mets cap on his plaque, along with Mike Piazza. He was also inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1988, the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2006.\nIn 1999, Seaver ranked 32nd on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the only player to have spent a majority of his career with the Mets to make the list. That year, he was also a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Baseball purists often compare him to Christy Mathewson for his combination of raw power, pinpoint control, intelligence, and intense scrutiny of his performance. Seaver was the foremost latter-day exponent of \"drop and drive\" overhand delivery that utilitized his powerful legs, took strain off of his arm, and helped ensure his longevity. He always credited the training he received in the Mets organization, citing the long careers of teammates Jerry Koosman, Nolan Ryan and Tug McGraw as further proof. Seaver could also help himself at the plate. A decent hitter and proficient bunter, Seaver hit 12 home runs during his career, along with a relatively solid lifetime average for a pitcher of .154.\n\nHank Aaron stated that Seaver was the toughest pitcher he ever faced. Seaver approached Aaron before his first All-Star Game in 1967 and asked Aaron for his autograph. Seaver felt the need to introduce himself to Aaron, as he was certain \"Hammerin' Hank\" would not know who he was. Aaron replied to Seaver, \"Kid, I know who you are, and before your career is over, I guarantee you everyone in this stadium will, too.\"\n\nOn September 28, 2006, Seaver was chosen as the \"Hometown Hero\" for the Mets franchise by ESPN. Seaver made a return to Shea Stadium during the \"Shea Goodbye\" closing ceremony on September 28, 2008, where he threw out the final pitch in the history of the stadium to Mike Piazza. He and Piazza then opened the Mets' new home, Citi Field with the ceremonial first pitch on April 13, 2009.\n\nThe 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated to Seaver. He concluded the introduction of the starting lineup ceremonies by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. Mets player David Wright participated.\n\nSince his retirement as a player, Seaver has sometimes been a television color commentator, working variously for the Mets, the New York Yankees, and with Vin Scully in for NBC. Seaver replaced Joe Garagiola as NBC's lead baseball color commentator, which led to him calling the 1989 All-Star Game and National League Championship Series. He worked as an analyst for Yankees' telecasts on WPIX from 1989 to 1993 and for Mets telecasts on WPIX from 1999 to 2005, making him one of three sportscasters to be regular announcers for both teams; the others are Fran Healy and Tim McCarver. He has also worked as a part-time scout, and as a spring training pitching coach. Seaver's TV experience dates back to his playing career, when he was invited to serve as a World Series analyst for ABC in and for NBC in , , and . Also while an active player, Seaver called the 1981 National League Division Series between Montreal and Philadelphia and that years's National League Championship Series alongside Dick Enberg for NBC.\n\nSeaver married Nancy Lynn McIntyre on June 9, 1966. They are parents of two daughters, Sarah and Annie. They live in Calistoga, California, where he started his own vineyard, Seaver Family Vineyards, on his estate in 2002. His first vintage was produced in 2005. He presented his two cabernets, \"Nancy's Fancy\" and \"GTS\", in an April 2010 wine-tasting event in SoHo to positive reviews.\n\nHis media nickname referred to the cartoon character Tom Terrific.\n\nIn 1991, Seaver was diagnosed with Lyme disease, which caused Bell's palsy. After lying dormant in his system the disease reoccurred in 2012. Seaver suffered from loss of memory not even remembering long term acquaintances, \"sleep disorder, nausea, and a general overall feeling of chemical imbalance\". In January 2013 Seaver was diagnosed with Stage 3 of the disease. As of July 2013, after a treatment regimen of mostly vitamins, Seaver was feeling much better. According to former teammate Bud Harrelson, Seaver has \"some short term memory loss but is otherwise doing well.\"\n\n"}

At the age of seventeen, he would join with Green DeWitt at Missouri. In 1824, he would assist DeWitt when traveling to Texas, bringing in families and settling near Gonzales, Texas. Mathews married Naomi Dewitt, a daughter of Green DeWitt and they had one son. Mathews became a prominent citizen of Gonzales, rendering aid to all settlers of the colony. His wife died early and in 1838 he married Nancy King, a daughter of John G. King. They had two children.\n\nMathews would aid in the colonization of the DeWitt Colony. He would contract with DeWitt, who was encountering difficulties filling his obligations with the Mexican government in bringing 400 families to Texas. Mathews was contracted to bring 20 families into the DeWitt Colony from Tennessee. Mathews would guide the group to Texas, seeing to procure their supplies and other needs. Once entering Texas he would assure that they would receive their land grants.

Corliss\n\nWilliam Roger Corliss (August 28, 1926 – July 8, 2011) was an American physicist and writer who was known for his interest in collecting data regarding anomalous phenomena. Arthur C. Clarke described him as \"Fort's latter-day - and much more scientific - successor.\"\n\nStarting in 1974, Corliss published a number of works in the \"Sourcebook Project\". Each volume was devoted to a scientific field (archeology, astronomy, geology, et cetera) and featured articles culled almost exclusively from scientific journals. Corliss was inspired by Charles Fort, who decades earlier also collected reports of unusual phenomena. Many of the articles in Corliss's works were earlier mentioned in Charles Fort's works. Unlike Fort, known for his idiosyncratic writing style, Corliss initially offered little in the way of his own opinions or editorial comments, preferring to let the articles speak for themselves. Corliss quoted all relevant parts of articles (often reprinting entire articles or stories, including illustrations). In some of his later \"Sourcebook\" efforts, such as the mid-1990s \"Biological Anomalies\" series, Corliss added his evaluation of both the reliability of the claims, and their ranking as anomalies. Well-documented reports from credible sources are ranked as a \"1\" while entirely unsubstantiated reports are rated as a \"4\", with \"2\" or \"3\" representing intermediate reports. Similarly, Corliss's uses a rating of \"1\" for anomalies that cannot be explained by existing scientific theories, while a \"4\" describes phenomena that are unusual but do not challenge scientific theories. \n\nCorliss wrote many other books and articles, notably including 13 educational books about astronomy, outer space and space travel for NASA and a similar number for the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Science Foundation.\n\nIn his book \"Unexplained!\", Jerome Clark describes Corliss as \"essentially conservative in outlook\". He explains, \"Corliss [is] more interested in unusual weather, ball lighting, geophysical oddities, extraordinary mirages, and the like — in short, anomalies that, while important in their own right, are far less likely to outrage mainstream scientists than those that delighted Fort, such as UFOs, monstrous creatures, or other sorts of extraordinary events and entities.\" \n\nArthur C. Clarke said:\n\nThe meteorologist Charles A. Doswell has praised the research of Corliss, stating his documentation of anomalies was intriguing. However, the geologist Henry Faul has criticized Corliss. In a review for \"Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena\", Faul states that Corliss is particularly prone to classify things as \"unexplained\" even when a good explanation is available. \n\nIn a review for a book that documented astronomical anomalies, the astronomer Joseph Veverka believes that in the book of Astronomical Anomalies Corliss was not privy to developments of the astronomical scientific literature for more than a decade and ended up making some incorrect statements.\n\nBooks published include:\n\n"}
