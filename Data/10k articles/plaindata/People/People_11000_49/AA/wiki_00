According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, he's obtained status as a U.S.-designated al-Qaeda facilitator and financier in Qatar. He is closely linked with Salim al-Kuwari, another U.S.-designated al-Qaeda financier who previously worked for Qatar's ministry of interior, with whom he worked with to deliver money, information, and other material support to al-Qaeda leaders in Iran. Kuwari would donate would donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to al-Qaeda in Iran over the years using the assistance of Abdullah Ghanim Mafuz Muslim al-Khawar. He was responsible for moving money and recruits from the Gulf region to al-Qaeda leaders. Khawar also played a large role in facilitating the travel and transport of al-Qaeda recruits to Afghanistan, who are interested in taking part in jihad there.\n\nAccording to other renowned terrorist financier Abd al-Rahman al-Nuayami's Alkarama, the human rights organization that was a used as front for coordinating terrorist activities and funding, that Khawar was arrested along with Kuwari in June 2009, and the two were detained for nearly 1 year. Alkarama promoted their case as a human rights cause with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Apparently, shortly after Kuwari was released and permitted to return to his previous job at the Interior Ministry in Qatar. It is not clear what happened to Khawar at this time, but it can be assumed that he was released as well. In early 2011, the two were detained once again, and Alkarama advocated for the pair once more in Doha with the same UN group. Before the UN group could take action, Khawar had been re-released. He attempted to leave Qatar, and at this time, Saudi Arabian authorities soon arrested him. The U.N. group intervened, under the impression that he was arrested inhumanely for expressing his political views.\n\nThough Khawar has had quite a few confrontations with law enforcement between the years of 2009 and 2011, but he has not been charged with any crime and still continues to function with an Iran-based al-Qaeda network, headed by Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil. Khalil operates as an al-Qaeda facilitator under an agreement between the terrorist group and the Iranian government. Khawar, however, still resides in Doha, despite the claims against him, and according to the country's Ministry of the Interior, he retains an active Qatari ID card and passport.\n"}

His art and his story have become well known throughout Canada. His paintings tell a personal story, and many feature images of his grandmother. His work and life story have been the subject of a number of books and television documentaries.\n\nSapp was born on the Red Pheasant Reserve, south of the city of North Battleford. His mother suffered from tuberculosis and died during his adolescence.\n\nSapp was raised by his maternal grandmother and grandfather, Albert and Maggie Soonias. As a child he was often ill and spent long hours in bed. His grandmother nurtured him and encouraged his love of drawing, while teaching him in the Cree ways.\n\nHe attended the Red Pheasant school, but his grandfather removed him from the school because he needed him on the farm. Sapp remained at home and cared for his grandmother until she died in 1963. \n\nAfter her death, Sapp moved to North Battleford to try to make a living as an artist, selling paintings door to door. In 1966 he met Dr. Allan Gonor, who recognized Sapp's talent and encouraged him to paint what he knew—life on the reserve. Sapp began to paint his childhood memories, often staying up all night painting. Gonor helped him to sell several paintings to the Winnipeg Art Gallery. In 1969, 40 of his paintings were displayed in an exhibition at the Robertson Galleries. By the 1970s, his work was known across North America and as far away as London, England.\n\nIn 1986, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \"for his portrayals of Native peoples and of life on the reserve\". In 1985, he was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit. In 1975, he was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 2003, he received the Governor General's Award for English language children's illustration for the book, \"The Song Within My Heart\".\n\nIn spite of his artistic success, Sapp's lack of education and disinterest in practical matters led to difficulties in managing his finances. He and his wife continued to live in a small home near North Battleford. He died in his sleep on December 29, 2015. His paintings illustrate the award-winning \"Nokum: is My Teacher\" by David Bouchard with music by the drum group Northern Cree.\n\nIn North Battleford, a gallery has been created to display Sapp's paintings.\n\n\n"}

His mother was Betty de Rothschild (1805–1886), the daughter of Salomon Mayer von Rothschild from the Austrian branch of the family. Alphonse was educated to take his place at the head of de Rothschild Frères bank, training in the other Rothschild banking houses in Europe. In France he soon became a major force in the financial world and in 1855 was appointed a regent of the Banque de France, a position he held for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1857 Alphonse de Rothschild married a cousin, Leonora \"Laure\" de Rothschild (1837–1911), the daughter of Lionel de Rothschild (1808–1879) of the English branch of the family. They had four children. Their firstborn, Bettina Caroline (1858–1892), married Albert Salomon von Rothschild.\n\nAlphonse and his brother Gustave developed somewhat of a rivalry with their English cousin Nathaniel de Rothschild who had moved to Paris after marrying their sister Charlotte. Nathaniel worked at de Rothschild Frères bank and in 1853 he purchased the Château Brane Mouton vineyard in Pauillac in the Médoc wine growing region. Nathaniel's Mouton vineyard received a second-growth ranking in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Just three months before their father died in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave convinced him to buy the more prestigious First Growth Château Lafite vineyard in Pauillac when it came up for sale.\n\nOn the death of their father in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave inherited the Château Lafite-Rothschild vineyard. However, they lived in Paris and the vineyard was not significant relative to their massive investments in banking and other business ventures. As such, they only visited the Pauillac vineyard occasionally, maintaining little more than an arms-length interest. On their deaths, the Rothschild brothers willed the property to a son and it remains in family hands to this day.\n\nAlphonse de Rothschild inherited a large fortune on the death of his father in 1868, including share positions in de Rothschild Frères bank and the Northern Railway company. He began his training in finance at a young age and his father put him in charge of the bank's gold bullion operations.\n\nDuring the 1860s, great debates raged across Europe and the United States as to an appropriate monetary system for the changing times. In France, the prominent Péreire brothers bankers were proponents of paper money in contrast to Alphonse de Rothschild who defended preservation of France's bimetallism system. Initially, Alphonse had an influential supporter for his position through his long friendship with statesman Léon Say, a former employee of the Rothschild's Northern Railway Company who became the Minister of Finance in 1872. However, as part of the Latin Monetary Union France joined most of the rest of Europe and adopted the gold standard by 1873. In 1880, Alphonse de Rothschild put together the deal that saw the family take control of Société Le Nickel (SLN), a nickel mining business in New Caledonia.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War, Alphonse de Rothschild had guarded the ramparts of Paris on the eve of the Prussian siege. When a peace treaty was finally agreed to in January 1871, his bank would play a major role, not only in raising the five billion francs France was obliged to pay in reparations to the new German Empire, but in helping bring about economic stability. France made a dramatic financial recovery and repaid the reparations bill ahead of schedule which, under terms of the armistice, brought about an end to the German occupation of northern French territory in 1873. In contrast though, that same year, both the Berlin and Vienna stock markets crashed, plunging all of Central Europe into an economic depression. However, in less than a decade Alphonse de Rothschild would witness considerable economic upheaval in France. The collapse of the investment bank Société de l'Union Générale precipitated the 1882 stock market crash that triggered a downturn in the economy. In 1889, the Comptoir d'Escompte de Paris bank went into receivership and shortly thereafter the Panama scandals erupted, culminating in an official enquiry into the matter conducted in 1893 by the French parliament.\n\nHis intense pressure pushed back the abrogation project of the \"décret Crémieux\" filed by the chief of the provisional government, Adolphe Thiers in 1871.\n\nAlready made a member of the Legion of Honor, for his contributions to the French economy at a time of crisis, in 1896 Alphonse de Rothschild was elevated to the Grand Cross, the highest class of the Legion of Honor.\n\nAlphonse de Rothschild was an enthusiastic supporter of thoroughbred horse racing who in 1852 at the age of twenty-four became a member of the Paris Jockey Club. He eventually purchased a rural property near Touques, Calvados in the Lower Normandy region where he built the Haras de Meautry horse breeding farm. There, he laid the foundation for a breeding operation that would prove highly successful for more than one hundred years and one that under the guidance of his descendants remains in operation today. Alphonse de Rothschild raced in an era before the creation of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Among the major races which his horses won were:\n\nOver his lifetime Alphonse de Rothschild put together a massive collection of artworks. He was an avid collector of the Dutch Masters as well as an important assembler of Islamic works of art. In 1885 he was made a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and would donate and/or bequeath approximately 2,000 pieces to many different museums.\n\nAs part of his father's estate, Alphonse de Rothschild inherited a large residence in Paris at 2 rue Saint-Florentin on Place de la Concorde which today is part of the American Embassy complex. In addition, he also received the Château de Ferrières, an enormous mansion and woodlands in the country about 26 km east of Paris.\n\nIn August 1895, a crude letter bomb addressed to Alphonse de Rothschild was delivered to his Paris residence. Not at home, a member of the house staff had it forwarded to the de Rothschild Frères offices where it detonated, seriously injuring the chief clerk.\n\nOn his death in 1905, Alphonse's son Edouard took over as head of the family business.\n"}

A press release on the report stated “Intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community.\"\n\nIn February 2017, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Defense completed its investigation and cleared the senior leadership of CENTCOM, concluding that \"allegations of intelligence being intentionally altered, delayed or suppressed by top CENTCOM officials from mid-2014 to mid-2015 were largely unsubstantiated.\"\n\nIn 2014, ISIL declared a worldwide caliphate and the US began military campaigns in Syria and Iraq to try to halt the spread of that caliphate as well as the Syrian Train and Equip Program. These efforts were conducted by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM), the U.S. geographic combatant command for the Middle East. CENTCOM military intelligence analysts were responsible with generating intelligence reports that would inform civilian leadership about the effectiveness of allied military efforts.\n\nIn July 2015, fifty CENTCOM analysts signed a complaint to the Pentagon's Inspector General that their intelligence reports were being inappropriately manipulated by members of CENTCOM. They were subsequently joined by civilian and Defense Intelligence Agency analysts working for CENTCOM. Members of the groups began anonymously leaking details of the case to the press in late-August. The analysts alleged that CENTCOM was trying to portray a rosy image of the fight against the Islamic State by altering some reports to seem more positive, while burying other reports to keep them from the press and Congress. The analysts alleged that the conclusions of both their reports about the readiness of indigenous forces to face ISIS, and about the effectiveness of the American air campaigns over Syria and Iraq, were reversed by the Administration before distribution. The media described the situation as \"a revolt\" inside the intelligence community. Congressional representatives vowed to investigate the matter and requested testimony from Department of Defense officials.\n\nIn August 2016, a United States Congressional report found \"widespread dissatisfaction\" among CENTCOM's intelligence analysts. A press release on the report stated “Intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community.\" According to the report, “Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events.\" The report provided an example of these overestimations, commenting that a CENTCOM official \"stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.”\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress commented on the report. According to Republican Representative Mike Pompeo, “From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command’s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command’s intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.” According to Democrat Representative Adam Schiff, “Between 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces,” which “stalled the release of intelligence products\" and “insufficiently accommodated dissenting views.”\n\nIn February 2017, the Inspector General completed its investigation and cleared the senior leadership of CENTCOM, concluding that \"allegations of intelligence being intentionally altered, delayed or suppressed by top CENTCOM officials from mid-2014 to mid-2015 were largely unsubstantiated.\" According to the commanding general of CENTCOM, General Joseph Votel, \"While the allegations were unsubstantiated, the DoD IG's report did provide thoughtful and helpful recommendations on ways to make improvements within the command and we are taking those and others' recommendations to heart and acting on them.\"\n"}

He was a signer of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nRoberdeau was born in 1727 on the Island of St. Christopher in the West Indies. His father was a Huguenot immigrant named Isaac Roberdeau; his mother, a Scot, Mary Cunningham. After the death of his father, he immigrated to Philadelphia with his mother and sisters. Roberdeau became a timber merchant and, for a number of years, served on the Board of Managers for a hospital in Philadelphia.\n\nRoberdeau was active in establishing Freemasonry in Philadelphia, which brought him to the attention of Benjamin Franklin and other civic leaders. He was elected to the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly, serving from 1756 to 1760, but then declined further service.\n\nWhen war neared, he joined the Associators (as the Pennsylvania rebel militia was known), and was made colonel of his regiment. In May 1776 he presided at several public meetings calling for the existing Pennsylvania delegation to the Continental Congress to be replaced with members who supported a Declaration of Independence. As a result, he was named to the Committee of Safety, and on July 4, 1776 was named a brigadier general in the state militia.\n\nRoberdeau was first elected to the Continental Congress in February 1777 and served there until 1779. Later that year, when the Continental Army entered winter quarters at Valley Forge, he worked with General Washington to set up a militia support network known as the Flying Camp, and served as its commander.\n\nIn April 1778, Roberdeau took a short leave from Congress. He had noted the shortage of powder and shot in the army, and used the time off to establish a lead mine in Bedford County. To protect the mine and camp from Indian attacks, he built a palisade, Fort Roberdeau, at his own expense. Historically, Roberdeau's fort was known as the \"Lead Mine Fort\". It has been reconstructed near its original site in Sinking Valley, near present-day Altoona, Blair County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter the war he moved to Alexandria, Virginia, and eventually settled in Winchester, where he died in 1795.

Plano police responded to a 9-1-1 call made by concerned workers at a local day care center who had spoken to her earlier that day. The operator testified that she confessed to her and that the gospel song, \"He Touched Me\" played in the background. When police arrived, they saw her calmly sitting down, covered in blood, holding the knife, and singing Christian hymns. \n\nHours after her arrest, police heard her repeatedly chanting, \"Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.\"\n\nAt the age of eight, Dena Laettner was diagnosed with hydrocephalus. She had eight surgeries to implant shunts into her brain, heart and abdomen before she was 13 years old. Her schoolmates made fun of her shaved head. She graduated from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, with a bachelor's degree in psychology. \n\nShe met her husband, John, when they were both students at Marist. She graduated from Marist, but he did not. Eventually they moved to Texas, where he would not allow her to work.\n\nThe day after Margaret was born, Schlosser attempted suicide, was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward, and diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features. She had been investigated earlier that year by the Texas Child Protective Services (CPS) after she was hospitalized for a psychotic episode. CPS ordered that she could not be alone with her children. Her sister-in-law came to live with them until CPS lifted the order. She came to believe that Margaret was destined to marry Doyle Davidson, a veterinarian who had become their pastor. The day before she attacked Margaret, Schlosser told her husband that she wanted to give her to Davidson. Later that day, according to a confidential CPS report, he spanked her with a wooden spoon in front of their children. She fatally injured Margaret, while her other two daughters were not harmed.\n\nPsychologist David Self testified that Schlosser told him about a disturbing news story she had seen. The news story concerned a boy who was mauled by a lion and she interpreted it as a sign of the coming apocalypse. She said that she heard God commanding her to remove Margaret's arms and then her own. The attack was later described as \"religious frenzy\". Self determined that she suffered from postpartum psychosis. She was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to the North Texas State Hospital and ordered to stay there until she is deemed to no longer be a threat to herself or others. There, she was a roommate of Andrea Yates, a Texas woman who had drowned her five children in a bathtub.\n\nDuring the trial, much attention was drawn to Schlosser and her husband attending Water of Life Church, a charismatic church pastored by Davidson. She had been taking antipsychotic drugs for several years prior to Margaret's death. Davidson thought that mental illness was demonic and this belief partly led Schlosser's husband to not buy her medication regularly. Under oath, Davidson testified that in his view, all mental illness is demonic at bottom. Due to viewer outcry after the trial, Davidson's television ministry was canceled everywhere outside the Metroplex.\n\nAfter Schlosser's arrest, her children were taken by CPS and kept in foster care. Schlosser's husband underwent a psychological evaluation, where he was diagnosed with \"narcissistic personality traits.\" The psychological report also stated that he did not do enough to protect his daughters from his mentally ill wife. CPS said they would only allow him to regain custody of them under the condition that his sister live with the family, and he was required to complete psychotherapy and parenting classes. He obliged and got them back in his home. He subsequently filed for divorce. As part of the divorce settlement, Schlosser was prohibited from ever having contact with him or their daughters again.\n\nOn November 6, 2008, it was announced that Schlosser would shortly be released into outpatient care. The order required her to see a psychiatrist once a week, take medication, be on physician-approved birth control, and not have any unsupervised contact with children.\n\nIn April 2010, it was reported that Schlosser was recommitted after firefighters from Richardson saw her walking down the street at 2 am. Her attorney, David Haynes, said that he felt the judge made the correct decision.\n\nSchlosser was later released to outpatient status. She stayed out of the public eye until 2012, when WFAA-TV in Dallas reported that she was working under her maiden name, Laettner, at a Walmart in Terrell. Within hours, they fired her.\n\nSchlosser was briefly seen in the 2005 documentary \"The God Who Wasn't There\", which is critical of Christianity.\n\nSchlosser is cited by atheist writer/director Brian Flemming, who was raised in a fundamentalist Christian home, as one of a series of people who committed and or incited others to commit crimes under the pretext of them being divinely inspired. Her caption reads, \"Devout Christian; Cut her baby's arms off, for God\". Charles Manson, Pat Robertson, Tim LaHaye, and Jerry B. Jenkins (the authors of the \"Left Behind\" series of books), and the victims of the Branch Davidian siege in Waco (described as \"86 crispy fans of similar apocalyptic literature\") are also shown.\n\nThere is also a segment about Schlosser in an August 23, 2013 episode of \"Deadly Women\" called \"Evil Guardians\".\n\n"}

Notkin has also been interviewed on \"The Today Show\", \"Coast to Coast\", and \"NASA Edge TV\". Notkin is regular special guest speaker at TusCon, an intimate science-fiction, fantasy, and horror convention held annually in Tucson, Arizona. \n\nNotkin was born in New York City, New York, but spent his childhood in and around London, England. Notkin also spent several of his formative years in Purley, Surrey and attended school in Croydon and St John’s Wood. \n\nHis parents were Sam Notkin, a twice-decorated World War II veteran who worked for the Port Authority, and Gay Flint Notkin, who worked for the American Embassy in Paris, the Rockafeller Foundation in New York, and the State Department. Notkin credits his father, an amateur astronomer, for his interest in space and meteorites. \n\nNotkin left England at age 19 and lived in New York City, later attending New York City's School of Visual Arts where he studied under renowned cartoonists Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman. Notkin eventually became the editor of \"Will Eisner’s Gallery of New Comics\" for SVA. \n\nAfter graduating college, Notkin worked at RAW Books and Graphics for owners Art Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly. Notkin later became a production assistant to Art Spiegelman while he was creating his graphic novel, \"Maus\", for which Spiegelman later won the Pulitzer Prize. Notkin also inspired one of Spiegelman’s \"Garbage Pail Kids,\" \"Deaf Geoff.\"\n\nNotkin also worked as a geologist for a year with an American oil exploration company based in London.\n\nIn 1976, at age 15, Notkin attended his first concert with childhood friend Neil Gaiman, Lou Reed on his Rock 'n' Roll Heart tour, for which he attributes his love of music. In 1977, age sixteen, Notkin was the drummer for a punk rock band, Ex-Execs, whose members included Graham K. Smith, Al Kingsbury, and Gaiman. The lead character in Gaiman's short story, which has since been adapted to film, \"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\", was inspired by Notkin. \n\nAs part of London's and New York's punk rock scene, Notkin performed at The Rock Garden in Convent Garden, the Fulham Greyhound, CBGB, The Stone Pony, and The Knitting Factory. Notkin remained a professional musician for over twenty years and worked with many artists, among them singer-songwriter Lach, with whom he formed a band called Proper iD, drummer Billy Ficca of Television, and Anne Husick of Band of Susans.

{"id": "222484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222484", "title": "Gog and Magog", "text": "Gog and Magog\n\nGog and Magog (; \"Gog u-Magog\") in the Hebrew Bible may be individuals, peoples, or lands; a prophesied enemy nation of God's people according to the Book of Ezekiel, and according to Genesis, one of the nations descended from Japheth, son of Noah.\n\nThe Gog prophecy is meant to be fulfilled at the approach of what is called the \"end of days\", but not necessarily the end of the world. Jewish eschatology viewed Gog and Magog as enemies to be defeated by the Messiah, which will usher in the age of the Messiah. Christianity's interpretation is more starkly apocalyptic: making Gog and Magog allies of Satan against God at the end of the millennium, as can be read in the Book of Revelation.\n\nA legend was attached to Gog and Magog by the time of the Roman period, that the Gates of Alexander were erected by Alexander the Great to repel the tribe. Romanized Jewish historian Josephus knew them as the nation descended from Magog the Japhetite, as in Genesis, and explained them to be the Scythians. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the Huns, Khazars, Mongols, Altaic people or other nomads, or even the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.\n\nThe legend of Gog and Magog and the gates was also interpolated into the Alexander romances. In one version, \"Goth and Magoth\" are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in human cannibalism in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or \"mappae mundi\", sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.\n\nThe conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian era. They appear in the Quran as Yajuj and Majuj ( \"\"), adversaries of Dhul-Qarnayn, who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and is most commonly considered to be Alexander the Great. Muslim geographers identified them at first with Turkic tribes from Central Asia and later with the Mongols. In modern times they remain associated with apocalyptic thinking, especially in the United States and the Muslim world.\n\nThe first mention of the two names occurs in the Book of Ezekiel, where Gog is an individual and Magog is his land. The meaning of the name Gog remains uncertain, and in any case the author of the Ezekiel prophecy seems to attach no particular importance to it. Efforts have been made to identify him with various individuals, notably Gyges, a king of Lydia in the early 7th century BCE, but many scholars do not believe he is related to any historical person. \n\nIn Genesis 10 Magog is a person, son of Japheth son of Noah, but no Gog is mentioned. The name Magog is equally obscure, but may come from the Assyrian \"mat-Gugu\", \"Land of Gyges\", i.e., Lydia. Alternatively, Gog may be derived from Magog rather than the other way round, and \"Magog\" may be code for Babylon.\n\nThe form \"Gog and Magog\" may have emerged as shorthand for \"Gog and/of the land of Magog\", based on their usage in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. An example of this combined form in Hebrew (\"Gog u-Magog\") has been found, but its context is unclear, being preserved only in a fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In Revelation, Gog and Magog together are the hostile nations of the world. Gog or Goug the Reubenite occurs in 1 Chronicles 5:4, but he appears to have no connection with the Gog of Ezekiel or Magog of Genesis.\n\nThe Biblical \"Gog and Magog\" possibly gave derivation of the name Gogmagog, a legendary British giant. A later corrupted folk rendition in print altered the tradition around Gogmagog and Corineus with two giants Gog and Magog, with whom the Guildhall statues came to be identified.\n\nThe Book of Ezekiel records a series of visions received by the 6th-century BC prophet Ezekiel, a priest of Solomon's Temple, who was among the captive during the Babylonian exile. The exile, he tells his fellow captives, is God's punishment on Israel for turning away, but God will restore his people to Jerusalem when they return to him. After this message of reassurance, chapters , the Gog oracle, tell how Gog of Magog and his hordes will threaten the restored Israel but will be destroyed, after which God will establish a new Temple and dwell with his people for a period of lasting peace (chapters 40–48). The Gog oracle, as internal evidence indicates, was composed substantially later than the chapters around it.\n\n\"Son of man, direct your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince, leader of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy concerning him. Say: Thus said the Lord: Behold, I am against you, Gog, the prince, leader of Meshech and Tubal ... Persia, Cush and Put will be with you ... also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth Togarmah from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you.\"\n\nOf Gog's allies, Meshech and Tubal were 7th-century kingdoms in central Anatolia north of Israel, Persia towards east, Cush (Ethiopia) and Put (Libya) to the south; Gomer is the Cimmerians, a nomadic people north of the Black Sea, and Beth Togarmah was on the border of Tubal. The confederation thus represents a multinational alliance surrounding Israel. \"Why the prophet's gaze should have focused on these particular nations is unclear,\" comments Biblical scholar Daniel I. Block, but their remoteness and reputation for violence and mystery possibly \"made Gog and his confederates perfect symbols of the archetypal enemy, rising against God and his people\". One explanation is that the Gog alliance, a blend of the \"Table of Nations\" in Genesis 10 and Tyre's trading partners in Ezekiel 27, with Persia added, was cast in the role of end-time enemies of Israel by means of Isaiah 66:19, which is another text of eschatological foretelling.\n\nAlthough the prophecy refers to Gog as an enemy in some future, it is not clear if the confrontation is meant to occur in a final \"end of days\" since the Hebrew term \"aḥarit ha-yamim\" () may merely mean \"latter days\", and is open to interpretation. Twentieth-century scholars have used the term to denote the eschaton in a malleable sense, not necessarily meaning final days, or tied to the Apocalypse. Still, the Utopia of chapters 40–48 can be spoken of in the parlance of \"true eschatological character, given that it is a product of \"cosmic conflict\" described in the immediately preceding Gog chapters.\n\nOver the next few centuries Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel's Gog \"from\" Magog into Gog \"and\" Magog. The process, and the shifting geography of Gog and Magog, can be traced through the literature of the period. The 3rd book of the Sibylline Oracles, for example, which originated in Egyptian Judaism in the middle of the 2nd century BC, changes Ezekiel's \"Gog from Magog\" to \"Gog and Magog\", links their fate with up to eleven other nations, and places them \"in the midst of Aethiopian rivers\"; this seems a strange location, but ancient geography did sometimes place Ethiopia next to Persia or even India. The passage has a highly uncertain text, with manuscripts varying in their groupings of the letters of the Greek text into words, leading to different readings; one group of manuscripts (\"group Y\") links them with the \"Marsians and Dacians\", in eastern Europe, amongst others.\n\nThe Book of Jubilees, from about the same time, makes three references to either Gog or Magog: in the first, Magog is a descendant of Noah, as in Genesis 10; in the second, Gog is a region next to Japheth's borders; and in the third, a portion of Japheth's land is assigned to Magog. The 1st-century \"Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum\", which retells Biblical history from Adam to Saul, is notable for listing and naming seven of Magog's sons, and mentions his \"thousands\" of descendants. The Samaritan Torah and the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible made during the last few centuries of the pre-Christian era) occasionally introduce the name of Gog where the Hebrew original has something else, or use Magog where the Hebrew has Gog, indicating that the names were interchangeable.\n\nChapters 19:11–21:8 of the Book of Revelation, dating from the end of the 1st century AD, tells how Satan is to be imprisoned for a thousand years, and how, on his release, he will rally \"the nations in the four corners of the Earth, Gog and Magog\", to a final battle with Christ and his saints:\n\nWhen the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the Earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.\n\nAfter the failure of the anti-Roman Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century AD which looked to a human leader as the promised messiah, Jews began to conceive of the messianic age in supernatural terms: first would come a forerunner, the Messiah ben Joseph, who would defeat Israel's enemies, identified as Gog and Magog, to prepare the way for the Messiah ben David; then the dead would rise, divine judgement would be handed out, and the righteous would be rewarded.\n\nThe aggadah, homiletic and non-legalistic exegetical texts in the classical rabbinic literature of Judaism, treat Gog and Magog as two names for the same nation who will come against Israel in the final war. The rabbis associated no specific nation or territory with them beyond a location to the north of Israel, but the great Jewish scholar Rashi identified the Christians as their allies and said God would thwart their plan to kill all Israel.\n\nThe 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus identified the Gog and Magog people as Scythians, horse-riding barbarians from around the Don and the Sea of Azov. Josephus recounts the tradition that Gog and Magog were locked up by Alexander the Great behind iron gates in the \"Caspian Mountains\", generally identified with the Caucasus Mountains. This legend must have been current in contemporary Jewish circles by this period, coinciding with the beginning of the Christian Era. Several centuries later, this material was vastly elaborated in the \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\" and Alexander romance.\n\nThe \"Pseudo-Methodius\", written originally in Syriac, is considered the source of Gog and Magog tale incorporated into Western versions of the Alexander Romance. An earlier-dated Syriac \"Alexander Legend\" contains a somewhat different treatment of the Gog and Magog material, which passed into the lost Arabic version, or the Ethiopic and later Oriental versions of the Alexander romance.\n\nIn the Syriac \"Alexander Legend\" dating to 629–630, Gog (, gwg) and Magog (ܵ, mgwg) appear as kings of Hunnish nations. Written by a Christian based in Mesopotamia, the \"Legend\" is considered the first work to connect the Gates with the idea that Gog and Magog are destined to play a role in the apocalypse. The legend claims that Alexander carved prophecies on the face of the Gate, marking a date for when these Huns, consisting of 24 nations, will breach the Gate and subjugate the greater part of the world.\n\n\"Pseudo-Methodius\" (7th century) is the first source in the Christian tradition for a new element: two mountains moving together to narrow the corridor, which was then sealed with a gate against Gog and Magog. This idea is also in the Quran and found its way in the Western Alexander Romance.\n\nThis Gog and Magog legend is not found in earlier versions of the Alexander romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes, whose oldest manuscript dates to the 3rd century, but an interpolation into recensions around the 8th century. In the latest and longest Greek version are described the Unclean Nations, which include the Goth and Magoth as their kings, and whose people engage in the habit of eating worms, dogs, human cadavers and fetuses. They were allied to Belsyrians (Bebrykes, of Bythinia in modern-day North Turkey), and sealed beyond the \"Breasts of the North\", a pair of mountains fifty days' march away towards the north.\n\nGog and Magog appear in somewhat later Old French versions of the romance. In the verse \"Roman d'Alexandre\", Branch III, of (c. 1170), Gog and Magog (\"Gos et Margos\", \"Got et Margot\") were vassals to Porus, king of India, providing an auxiliary force of 400,000 men. Routed by Alexander, they escaped through a defile in the mountains of Tus (or Turs), and were sealed by the wall erected there, to last until the advent of the Antichrist. Branch IV of the poetic cycle tells that the task of guarding Gog and Magog, as well as the rule of Syria and Persia was assigned to Antigonus, one of Alexander's successors.\nGog and Magog also appear in Thomas de Kent's \"Roman de toute chevalerie\" (c. 1180), where they are portrayed as cave-dwellers who consume human flesh. A condensed account occurs in a derivative work, the Middle English \"King Alisaunder\" (vv. 5938–6287). In the 13th-century French \"Roman d'Alexandre en prose\", Alexander has an encounter with cannibals who have taken over the role of Gog and Magog. This is a case of imperfect transmission, since the \"prose Alexander\"'s source, the Latin work by Archpriest Leo of Naples known as \"Historia de Preliis\", does mention \"Gogh et Macgogh\", at least in some manuscripts.\n\nThe Gog and Magog are not only human flesh-eaters, but illustrated as men \"a notably beaked nose\" in examples such as the \"Henry of Mainz map\", an important example of \"mappa mundi\". Gog and Magog caricaturised as figures with hooked noses on a miniature depicting their attack of the Holy City, found in a manuscript of the \"Apocalypse\" in Anglo-Norman.\n\nEarly Christian writers (e.g. Eusebius) frequently identified Gog and Magog with the Romans and their emperor. After the Empire became Christian, Ambrose (d. 397) identified Gog with the Goths, Jerome (d. 420) with the Scythians, and Jordanes (died c. 555) said that Goths, Scythians and Amazons were all the same; he also cited Alexander's gates in the Caucasus. The Byzantine writer Procopius said it was the Huns Alexander had locked out, and a Western monk named Fredegar seems to have Gog and Magog in mind in his description of savage hordes from beyond Alexander's gates who had assisted the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610–641) against the Saracens.\n\nAs one nomadic people followed another on the Eurasian steppes, so the identification of Gog and Magog shifted. In the 9th and 10th centuries these kingdoms were identified by some with the lands of the Khazars, a Turkic people who had converted to Judaism and whose empire dominated Central Asia–the 9th-century monk Christian of Stavelot referred to Gazari, said of the Khazars that they were \"living in the lands of Gog and Magog\" and noted that they were \"circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism\". Arab traveler ibn Fadlan also reported of this belief, writing around 921 he recorded that \"Some hold the opinion that Gog and Magog are the Khazars\".\n\nAfter the Khazars came the Mongols, seen as a mysterious and invincible horde from the east who destroyed Muslim empires and kingdoms in the early 13th century; kings and popes took them for the legendary Prester John, marching to save Christians from the Saracens, but when they entered Poland and Hungary and annihilated Christian armies a terrified Europe concluded that they were \"Magogoli\", the offspring of Gog and Magog, released from the prison Alexander had constructed for them and heralding Armageddon.\n\nEuropeans in Medieval China reported findings from their travels to the Mongol Empire. Some accounts and maps began to place the \"Caspian Mountains\", and Gog and Magog, just outside the Great Wall of China. The \"Tartar Relation\", an obscure account of Friar Carpini's 1240s journey to Mongolia, is unique in alleging that these Caspian Mountains in Mongolia, \"where the Jews called Gog and Magog by their fellow countrymen are said to have been shut in by Alexander\", were moreover purported by the Tartars to be magnetic, causing all iron equipment and weapons to fly off toward the mountains on approach. In 1251, the French friar André de Longjumeau informed his king that the Mongols originated from a desert further east, and an apocalyptic Gog and Magog (\"Got and Margoth\") people dwelled further beyond, confined by the mountains.\n\nIn fact, Gog and Magog were held by the Mongol to be their ancestors, at least by some segment of the population. As traveler and Friar Riccoldo da Monte di Croce put it in c. 1291, \"They say themselves that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account they are called \"Mogoli\", as if from a corruption of \"Magogoli\"\". Marco Polo, traveling when the initial terror had subsided, places Gog and Magog among the Tartars in Tenduc, but then claims that the names Gog and Magog are translations of the place-names Ung and Mungul, inhabited by the Ung and Mongols respectively.\n\nAn explanation offered by Orientalist Henry Yule was that Marco Polo was only referring to the \"Rampart of Gog and Magog\", a name for the Great Wall of China. Friar André's placement of Gog and Magog far east of Mongolia has been similarly explained.\n\nSome time around the 12th century, the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel came to be identified with Gog and Magog; possibly the first to do so was Petrus Comestor in \"Historica Scholastica\" (c. 1169–1173), and he was indeed a far greater influence than others before him, although the idea had been anticipated by the aforementioned Christian of Stavelot, who noted that the Khazhars, to be identified with Gog and Magog, was one of seven tribes of the Hungarians and had converted to Judaism.\n\nWhile the confounding Gog and Magog as confined Jews was becoming commonplace, some, like Riccoldo or Vincent de Beauvais remained skeptics, and distinguished the Lost Tribes from Gog and Magog. As noted, Riccoldo had reported a Mongol folk-tradition that they were descended from Gog and Magog. He also addressed many minds (Westerners or otherwise) being credulous of the notion that Mongols might be Captive Jews, but after weighing the pros and cons, he concluded this was an open question.\n\nThe Flemish Franciscan monk William of Rubruck, who was first-hand witness to Alexander's supposed wall in Derbent on the shores of the Caspian Sea in 1254, identified the people the walls were meant to fend off only vaguely as \"wild tribes\" or \"desert nomads\", but one researcher made the inference Rubruck must have meant Jews, and that he was speaking in the context of \"Gog and Magog\". Confined Jews were later to be referred to as \"Red Jews\" (\"die roten Juden\") in German-speaking areas; a term first used in a Holy Grail epic dating to the 1270s, in which Gog and Magog were two mountains enclosing these people.\n\nThe author of the \"Travels of Sir John Mandeville\", a 14th-century best-seller, said he had found these Jews in Central Asia where as Gog and Magog they had been imprisoned by Alexander, plotting to escape and join with the Jews of Europe to destroy Christians.\n\nIn the Quran Surah 18, Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) are suppressed by Dhul-Qarnayn \"the two-horned one\", a figure derived ultimately from Alexander the Great. Dhul-Qarnayn, having journeyed to the ends of the world, meets \"a people who scarcely understood a word\" who seek his help in building a barrier that will separate them from the people of Yajuj and Majuj who \"do great mischief on earth\". He agrees to build it for them, but warns that when the time comes (Last Age), Allah will remove the barrier and Yajuj and Majuj will swarm through.\n\nThe early Muslim traditions were summarised by Zakariya al-Qazwini (d. 1283) in two popular works called the Cosmography and the Geography. Gog and Magog, he says, live near to the sea that encircles the Earth and can be counted only by God; they are only half the height of a normal man, with claws instead of nails and a hairy tail and huge hairy ears which they use as mattress and cover for sleeping. They scratch at their wall each day until they almost break through. They break for the night saying tomorrow we will finish, and each night God restores it. Then one day, as they stop scratching for the night, one will say tomorrow we will finish God Willing, and in the morning, it is not restored as with everything night. When they do break through they will be so numerous that \"their vanguard is in Syria and their rear in Khorasan\".\n\nVarious nations and peoples in history were identified as Ya'juj and Ma'juj. At one point, it was the Turks, who threatened Baghdad and northern Iran; later, when the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258, it was they who were Gog and Magog. The wall dividing them from civilised peoples was normally placed towards Armenia and Azerbaijan, but in the year 842 the Caliph Al-Wathiq had a dream in which he saw that it had been breached, and sent an official named Sallam to investigate. Sallam returned a little over two years later and reported that he had seen the wall and also the tower where Dhul Qarnayn had left his building equipment, and all was still intact. It is not entirely clear what Sallam saw, but he may have reached the Jade Gate, the westernmost customs point on the border of China. Somewhat later the 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta reported that the wall was sixty days' travel from the city of Zeitun, which is on the coast of China; the translator notes that Ibn Battuta has confused the Great Wall of China with that built by Dhul-Qarnayn.\n\nIt has been narrated from Ibn Abbas that when he asked Ali about the \"creatures\", he responded by saying God has created \"1,200 species on the land, 1,200 species in the sea, 70 species from the Children of Adam and the people are the Children of Adam except for the Yajooj and Majooj\".\n\nIn the early 19th century, some Chasidic rabbis identified the French invasion of Russia under Napoleon as \"The War of Gog and Magog\". But as the century progressed, apocalyptic expectations receded as the populace in Europe began to adopt an increasingly secular worldview. This has not been the case in the United States, where a 2002 poll indicated that 59% of Americans believed the events predicted in the Book of Revelation would come to pass. During the Cold War the idea that Soviet Russia had the role of Gog gained popularity, since Ezekiel's words describing him as \"prince of Meshek\"—\"rosh meshek\" in Hebrew—sounded suspiciously like Russia and Moscow. Even some Russians took up the idea, apparently unconcerned by the implications (\"Ancestors were found in the Bible, and that was enough\"), as did Ronald Reagan.\n\nSome post–Cold War millenarians still identify Gog with Russia, but they now tend to stress its allies among Islamic nations, especially Iran. For the most fervent, the countdown to Armageddon began with the return of the Jews to Israel, followed quickly by further signs pointing to the nearness of the final battle—nuclear weapons, European integration, Israel's seizure of Jerusalem, and America's wars in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf. In the prelude to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush told Jacques Chirac, \"Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East\". \"This confrontation\", he urged the French leader, \"is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people's enemies before a new age begins\". Chirac consulted a professor at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Lausanne to explain Bush's reference.\n\nIn the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, the end of the world would be preceded by the release of Gog and Magog, whose destruction by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection. Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but the needs of the modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as Communist Russia and China. One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not to be found in the modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Harrga is the action of \"burning the borders and the sea.\"\n\nOn the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, Algerian, Tunisian, and Moroccan harragas typically hope to cross the Strait of Gibraltar in order to reach Spain, specifically the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla. Additionally, harragas also sometimes manage to complete the voyage from Africa to the island nation of Malta, or the Italian island of Lampedusa. From here they often go on to emigrate to other regions of Europe.\n\nOn the Atlantic coast of North Africa, Mauritanian and Senegalese harragas set off in hope of reaching the Spanish-controlled Canary Islands in small, flat-bottomed boats referred to in Spanish as \"patera\", or in rigid or inflatable rafts, (such as \"Zodiac\" rafts), or even paddle boats. Obviously, boats such as these are not designed for ocean crossings and the death rates for harragas are very high. The motivations for undertaking this extremely risky act are twofold: profound economic poverty and extreme political repression, both widespread throughout North Africa.\n\nAlgerian film director started shooting a film entitled \"Harraga Blues\" February 6, 2011.

Manzi was interested in literature and tango since he was young. After a brief incursion in journalism, he worked as a literature and Spanish professor but for political reasons (in addition to his membership in the Unión Cívica Radical) he was expelled from his professorship and decided to dedicate himself to the arts.\n\nIn 1935 he participated in the beginnings of FORJA (Fuerza de Orientación Radical de la Joven Argentina – Force of Radical Orientation of the Young in Argentina), group whose position has been classified as “peoples nationalism”. It was centered almost exclusively in the problems in Argentina and Latin America. They manifested to “reconquer the political Sunday from our own land” since it was considered that the country was still in a colonial situation. In relation to the European conflict at the time, it supported a neutral position sustaining that there was no great interest was in play in Argentina or Latin America, it was more of a rejection position towards fascism just as much as communism.\n\nIn 1934 Manzi founded \"Micrófono\" (\"Microphone\") magazine which covered subjects related to radio telephony, Argentine movies and film making. He wrote the screenplay for \"Nobleza Gaucha\" in 1937 in collaboration with Hugo Mac Dougall, and a new version of the silent movie of 1915, \"Huella\" (\"Footprint\") (1940), for which they received second prize from Buenos Aires City Hall. He also worked in \"Confesión\" (\"Confession\") (1940), without achieving commercial success with any of these movies.\n\nIn 1940 Manzi started what would be a long collaboration with Ulyses Petit de Murat, writing the screenplay for \"Con el dedo en el gatillo\" (\"Finger on the trigger\") (1940) \"Fortín alto\" (\"High Fort\") (1940), and \"The Gaucho War\" (1942). At the 1943 Argentine Film Critics Association Awards, Manzi and Murat won the Silver Condor Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for their screenplay of \"The Gaucho War\" which proved highly successful.\n\nThe early death of the poet was caused by cancer on Thursday, May 3, 1951.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the youngest of three boys, all of whom shared their father's artistic inclinations, although he was the only one to go on to pursue a professional career in the arts. \n\nHe attended Brooklyn's Edward R. Murrow High School where he participated in the drama club, then earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at New York University, where he was part of the CAP 21 acting program. \n\nMuñoz's early roles include Ziad, the \"best friend\" in Kari Floren's \"The Porch\" at Altered Stages in New York, and roles in other off-Broadway productions. He was in the 2006 New York Musical Theatre Festival's off-Broadway show \"All Is Love\", and had abandoned acting to accept a full-time job as a manager at the restaurant 44½ in Hell's Kitchen, when he auditioned for the musical \"In the Heights\". He landed a role that was cut from the show during rehearsals, but he stayed on as a member of the ensemble.\n\nOn February 16, 2009, Muñoz took the male lead of Usnavi in the Broadway cast of \"In the Heights\". Muñoz went on to play Usnavi in the national tour. Theater critic Robert Feldberg wrote that he preferred Muñoz in the role originated by Miranda, pointing out that the romance between Usnavi and Vanessa seemed more \"believable\" and that in putting across the main storyline in a way that Miranda had been unable to do, Muñoz turned the star vehicle into an \"emotionally persuasive\" ensemble performance.\n\nIn 2015 Muñoz began performing as alternate for the role of Alexander Hamilton in the Broadway production \"Hamilton\". By spring 2016, Muñoz appeared in the role originated by Lin-Manuel Miranda every Sunday and on weekdays whenever Miranda needed to be elsewhere on a weekday. Muñoz played the role of Hamilton the night President Barack Obama brought his family to watch the show. \"New York Times\" theatre critic Ben Brantley noted Muñoz's role subbing for Miranda in the role of Hamilton, stating \"the cutting carnal edge of Mr. Muñoz's performance may slightly alter the production's chemistry, especially between Hamilton and Angelica Schuyler, his intellectual equal and sister-in-law.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2016, Muñoz assumed the title role in \"Hamilton\" from Miranda full-time. He took a leave of absence due to an injury in February 2017, and was temporarily replaced by Jevon McFerrin until his return on March 21, 2017.\n\nOn August 2, 2017, Muñoz made a guest appearance in a musical skit on \"Full Frontal with Samantha Bee\". In the skit, Muñoz played the role of an immigrant affected by Kris Kobach's anti-immigration efforts.\n\nMuñoz was announced as a guest star with a recurring role in the third season (2018) of \"Shadowhunters\".\n\nMuñoz is a cancer survivor and has lived with HIV since 2002. He is openly gay.\n\nOn October 15, 2017, Muñoz became part of the #MeToo movement by posting on Twitter in response to Alyssa Milano's call for all who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to join together and speak up to bring publicity to the problem.

The Australian government soon after deported him back to United States, and after six years of fruitless efforts aimed at finding another country to which he could be admitted as a refugee, Slater asked the State Department to reverse its earlier recognition of his renunciation, and had his U.S. citizenship restored.\n\nIn December 1987, Slater appeared before the U.S. consul in Perth, Australia and renounced his citizenship; the State Department confirmed his renunciation and issued him with a Certificate of Loss of Nationality. At the time, roughly 300 Americans renounced their citizenship each year, but typically obtained other citizenships. Slater too had plans to marry an Australian woman and eventually obtain Australian citizenship through her, but that fell through, leaving him stateless. Slater's only travel document was a World Passport issued by Garry Davis' World Service Authority. He stated that he renounced his citizenship in protest of the foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration, in particular the 1986 bombing of Libya. He was quoted as saying, \"I'm sick and tired of the United States. It's like belonging to a country club where you don't like the way the directors are behaving, and you cancel your membership.\"\n\nAustralia deported Slater after his United States passport was revoked; he was readmitted to the U.S. on a humanitarian parole, which he stated that he did not want. Slater then made various attempts to find another country which would admit him for settlement, going back and forth into Mexico and at one point even hitchhiking across Canada to Newfoundland and then taking a ferry to the nearby French overseas territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon in an effort to gain admission there. He chose a French territory as a destination because France was a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. However, the territorial prefect at the time would not permit him to remain. His Canadian lawyer Gary Botting was quoted as stating that there was a \"mini riot ... [s]everal fishermen went on a rampage\".\n\nSlater returned to the United States, but his earlier work authorization had expired due to his departure, and his Social Security Number was no longer valid. By March 1991, after his return to the U.S. he was living in an abandoned building near the railroad tracks in Tucson, Arizona. He expressed interest in going to Norway, but the government there stated that he could not be admitted without a job. The U.S. also refused to issue him a refugee travel document. Slater referred to his situation as \"internal exile\". In 1991, the U.S. Department of State stated that Slater could request his citizenship back, but Slater stated that he was not interested. Despite all his migration difficulties, in a 1992 interview he stated that he had no regrets, comparing his actions to those taken by Sons of Liberty in the Boston Tea Party. By late 1992, he was quoted by the \"Santa Barbara News-Press\" as stating that he hoped Bill Clinton could restore his U.S. citizenship by executive order. He regained U.S. citizenship in 1993.\n\nSlater was born in Waterloo, Iowa to Jerry L. Slater, Sr. and Shirley M. Rodery Slater. He had a sister Debra Slater, a younger brother Jerry L. Slater, Jr., and another brother who died as an infant. Slater's mother later married Robert G. Papach, also of Waterloo, with whom she had a son James, Slater's half brother; she died in 1999. Slater's brother Jerry lived in Moscow, Iowa; he died in 2006. Slater himself died at his home in Pocatello, Idaho on March 26, 2008, where his body was found five days later.

Until June 2016, Bradley was incorrectly identified as being one of the six men raising a second, larger flag about 90 minutes later, though he was still on the mountaintop and witnessed – but was not part of – the specific moment of raising the larger flag that was captured in the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo \"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\" taken by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal.\n\nJohn Bradley was born in Antigo, Wisconsin, to James (\"Cabbage\") and Kathryn Bradley. He was the second eldest of five children. He grew up in Appleton, Wisconsin, graduating from Appleton Senior High School in 1941. His younger sister Mary Ellen died of pneumonia at a young age. He had an interest in entering the funeral business from an early age, because he felt those were the men everyone looked up to, and later got a job at his local funeral home. He then completed an 18-month apprenticeship course with a local funeral director before he entered the U.S Navy during World War II.\n\nBradley enlisted the U.S. Navy on January 13, 1943 when his father suggested it as a way to avoid ground combat. Following his completion of Navy recruit training at the Farragut Naval Training Station at Bayview, Idaho, he was assigned to the Hospital Corps School at Farragut, Idaho in March 1943. After completing the Hospital corpsman course, he was assigned to Naval Hospital Oakland in Oakland, California. In January 1944, he was assigned to the Fleet Marine Force and sent to one of the \"field medical service schools\" at a Marine Corps base for training to serve with Marines. After completing the course, he was assigned to the 5th Marine Division on April 15, a newly activated infantry division which was then being formed at Camp Pendleton, California. He was reassigned there to Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment of the division.\n\nOn February 19, 1945, the 5th Marine Division which included Bradley took part in the assault on Iwo Jima which was one of the most bitterly fought battles of the Pacific War's island-hopping campaign.\n\nBradley was assigned to Third Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines before and when they landed on the beach with the ninth wave of assault Marines at the south end of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi. After Bradley and PhM3c. Clifford Langley, the other E Company corpsman assigned to Third Platoon, aided American casualties on the beach, they continued on with E Company as the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines advanced towards Mount Suribachi, which was their objective on the southwest end of the island. On February 21, Bradley risked his life under fire to save the life of a Marine at the base of the mountain who was caught in the open under heavy Japanese fire. While still under and exposed to enemy fire, and in order to save the lives of other Marines who were willing to expose themselves under fire to bring back the wounded Marine, Bradley brought the wounded Marine to safety himself. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions.\n\nAt 8 AM on February 23, Bradley and Navy corpsman, PhM2c. Gerald Ziehme (replaced PhM3c. Langley who was wounded in action on February 21), were part of the 40-man combat patrol (mostly from Third Platoon, Easy Company) that was sent to climb up the east slope of Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest. E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant Harold Schrier who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise an American flag to signal that the mountaintop was captured.\n\nLt. Schrier and his men reached the top after a small number of Japanese sniper shots, then there was brief skirmish at the rim of the crater. On top, the Marines found a steel pipe to attach the flag unto. The flagstaff was taken to the highest position on the crater. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas and Sgt. Henry Hansen, raised the flag, planting the steel pipe into the ground approximately 10:20 AM. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheering from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships near the beach. After the flag was raised, Bradley, who was with the group of Marines near the flagstaff, pitched in to help the flagstaff stay vertical in the terrific winds on the volcano.\n\nIn order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land off and around Mount Suribachi, it was decided that another larger flag should be flown on Mt. Suribachi. Marine Sgt. Michael Strank a squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, was ordered to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the replacement flag. He then ordered Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Pfc. Franklin Sousley to go with him up Suribachi. Pfc. Rene Gagnon the company's runner (messenger), was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag that was flying on top.\n\nOnce all five Marines were on top, another pipe was found and the replacement flag was attached to it. At approximately 1 PM, Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the replacement flag and the lowering of the original flag. The flag was raised by Block (misidentified as Sgt. Hansen until January 1947), Gagnon, Hayes, Pfc. Harold Schultz (misidentified as Bradley until June 23, 2016), Sousley and Strank. Both men originally misidentified as flag raisers had helped raise the earlier flag, and were both still on the mountaintop and witnessed – but were not part of – the specific moment of raising the larger flag that was captured in Joe Rosenthal's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo \"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\".\n\nOn March 4, Bradley shot a Japanese soldier charging him with a bayonet with his pistol as he treated a wounded Marine in a shell hole.\n\nOn March 12, Bradley and three Marines received shrapnel wounds from an enemy mortar round explosion. All four were quickly attended to by other corpsmen. Bradley was wounded in the legs and feet and was evacuated from the combat zone to the battalion aid station, field hospital, and was flown to Guam, Hawaii, and Oakland Naval Hospital. He was awarded the Purple Heart Medal. On March 14, General Holland Smith ordered an American flag raised at Kitano Point on the northern end of the island, and the flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi be taken down. The battle of Iwo Jima was officially over on March 26.\n\nOn March 30, 1945, President Roosevelt ordered that the three flag-raisers in Joe Rosenthal's photograph be sent immediately to Washington, D.C. to appear as a public morale factor. On April 8, the Marine Corps announced that Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley were the three surviving flag-raisers in the picture and that Sgt. Hansen, Sgt. Strank, and Pfc. Sousley were killed in action. On April 19, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley's services were requested to participate in the Seventh War Loan drive. On May 9, a flag-raising by Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley at the Nation's capital kicked off the bond-selling tour which began on May 11 in New York and ended on July 4 with Gagnon and Bradley's return to Washington, D.C. (Hayes left the bond tour on May 25 after he was ordered back to E Company in Hawaii). The bond tour was held in 33 American cities that raised over $26 billion to help pay for and win the war (the war was over in Europe on May 2).\n\nBradley was medically discharged from the Navy in November 1945.\n\nBradley married Betty Van Gorp (1924–2013), settled in Antigo, had eight children, and was active in numerous civic clubs, rarely taking part in ceremonies celebrating the flag-raising — and by the 1960s avoiding them altogether. He subsequently purchased and managed a funeral parlor. Bradley's wife later said he was tormented by memories of the war, wept in his sleep for the first four years of their marriage and kept a large knife in a dresser drawer for \"protection\". He also had flashbacks of his best friend Iggy, Ralph Ignatowski, who was captured and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Bradley could not forgive himself for not being there to try and save his friend's life.\n\nThe Marine Corps War Memorial (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, which was inspired by Rosenthal's photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi was dedicated on November 10, 1954.\n\nUntil June 23, 2016, Bradley was incorrectly depicted on the memorial as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff with the 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze statues of the other five flag-raisers on the monument. Franklin Sousley is now depicted as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff (Harold Schultz in place of Sousley is now depicted as the fifth statue).\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower attended the dedication of the memorial and sat upfront with Vice President Richard Nixon, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr., the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Also in attendance were two of the three surviving flag-raisers, Ira Hayes and Rene Gagnon, who were seated together with Bradley (who was incorrectly believed to be a surviving second flag-raiser) in the front rows of seats along with relatives of those who were killed in action on the island. Speeches were given by Richard Nixon, Robert Anderson who dedicated the memorial, and General Shepherd who presented the memorial to the American people. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:\n\nBradley had a heart attack, but died of a stroke at 2:12 am in an Antigo hospital on January 11, 1994, at the age of 70. He is buried in Queen of Peace Cemetery, Antigo, Wisconsin.\n\nOn June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps announced after reviewing new information in regard to the identities of the six second flag-raisers atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, that Marine Harold Schultz not Bradley is in Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the second flag-raising (Franklin Sousley is now where Bradley was thought to be in the photo and Schultz is now where Sousley was in the picture). The Marine Corps stated Bradley was involved with the first flag-raising on Mount Suribachi the same day. A previous Marine Corps investigation into the identities of the six second flag-raisers was held in December 1946 and January 1947 that determined Marines Michael Strank, Ira Hayes, Franklin Sousley, Rene Gagnon, Harlon Block and Navy corpsman John Bradley were in the photograph, and Marine Henry Hansen was not. Bradley is no longer identified as one of the six flag-raisers on the Marine Corps War Memorial.\n\nOn April 3, 1945, Gagnon was the first second flag-raiser ordered to report to Washington, D.C. which he did on April 7, 1945. On April 8, after Gagnon was interviewed by a lieutenant colonel about who the second flag-raisers were, the Marine Corps incorrectly named Bradley (and incorrectly named Hansen) publicly as one of the six flag-raisers. While Bradley was recovering from his wounds at the Naval Hospital Oakland after the battle, he was shown the famous flag-raising photograph which appeared in the newspapers and was told he was in it. Bradley was then ordered to Washington, D.C. He arrived in Washington on crutches on April 19 as did Ira Hayes. Both men were interviewed by the same lieutenant colonel about who the flag-raisers were in the photograph. Bradley agreed with Gagnon and his naming Hansen and himself as flag-raisers. Hayes also named Bradley, and claimed he told the interviewer in charge who was the same lieutenant colonel, that Harlon Block was in the picture and Hansen was not. The interviewer told Hayes a list of the names of the six flag-raisers were already released publicly and he should stick only with these six names since Block was killed in action (in 1946, the lieutenant colonel denied Hayes ever mentioned Block to him).\n\nOn April 20, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley met Truman at the White House and each showed him their positions in the flag-raising picture. A press conference was also held that day and Gangon, Hayes, and Bradley were questioned about the flag-raising. On May 9, 1945, Bradley did an oral interview for the Navy by a captain about the famous flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, and incorrectly said he was in the second flag-raising picture, and when questioned about the first flag-raising, he said Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas raised that flag. In 1985, he did another interview about the flag-raising (second raising) at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren. During that interview, Bradley said that he would not have raised the flag if he had known how famous the photo (Rosenthal photograph) would become. He stated that he did not want to live with the pressures of the media and desired to live a normal life. He also stated, during the interview, that anyone on the island could have raised the flag and that he was just there at the right time \n\nBradley rarely did an interview for the newspapers, he refused to talk to and avoided reporters as much as possible. Throughout his life, the press would contact his home to ask for interviews and he trained his wife and children to give excuses such as he \"was on a fishing trip in Canada.\" Even during the filming of the movie the \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" in 1949, Bradley told his wife to tell the townspeople that he was \"on a business trip\" in order to avoid attention that would be drawn to him.\" Despite his reluctance to talk to the media, family, and friends about the incident, he told his parents in a letter a few days after the incident that raising the flag was the \"happiest moment of my life\", though he was most likely referring to the first flag raising where he helped secure the flagstaff into the ground after it was raised and planted.\n\nBradley saw the flag raising(s) as an insignificant event in a devastating battle. He rarely talked to people about it and spent most of his life trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he \"just happened to be there\". He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation. His daughter Barbara said that \"Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine…it would have been something I had to hide.\" He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.\n\nHis son James Bradley speculated that his father's determined silence and discomfort on the subject of his role in the Battle of Iwo Jima was largely due to memories of Bradley's wartime buddy, Marine Ralph \"Iggy\" Ignatowski. In his own words, and only once, he briefly told his son what happened with \"Iggy\":\n\nOfficial reports revealed Ignatowski was captured, dragged into a tunnel by Japanese soldiers during the battle, and was later found with his eyes, ears, fingernails, and tongue removed, his teeth smashed, the back of his head caved in, multiple bayonet wounds to the abdomen, and his arms broken. Bradley's recollections of discovering and taking care of Ignatowski's remains haunted him until his death, and he suffered for many years from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nBradley's military decorations and awards include:\n\nBradley played and was portrayed an American flag raiser in the following films, prior to the 2016 correction that it should be Harold Schultz, rather than Bradley:\n\n\nThe following are named in memory of Bradley:\n\n\n\n"}

He is an alumnus of DePaul University in Chicago.\n\nReilly made his film debut in the Brian De Palma war film \"Casualties of War\" as PFC Herbert Hatcher in 1989.

Terrence Malick's ensemble war film, \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998) featured Reilly in a supporting role that was written as a larger one, but much of his scenes were deleted along with many other cast members. In 1999, Reilly starred in the independent film \"The Settlement\" alongside William Fichtner, which \"Variety\" writer Robert Koehler dismissed as a \"write-off\" despite praising his performance. That same year, Reilly was cast in the romantic comedy \"Never Been Kissed\", playing the role of Drew Barrymore's newspaper managing editor. In Sam Raimi's sports drama \"For Love of the Game\", released the same year, Reilly played fictional baseball catcher Gus Sinski.\n\nThe box office hit \"The Perfect Storm\" was his only release of 2000 and featured Reilly as a veteran crew member on the \"Andrea Gail\" fishing vessel which was caught in the 1991 Perfect Storm.

He was one of his few friends.\" He played the lead role in the crime film \"Criminal\" (2004), with Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Based on the Argentine film \"Nine Queens\" (2000), Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" felt that \"John C. Reilly may be one of our finer character actors, but his portrayal of Richard Gaddis, a gimlet-eyed con man, in \"Criminal\" allows too many vestiges of the duped schlub of a husband he played in \"Chicago\" to leak into his performance.\" Reilly reportedly quit the 2005 Lars von Trier film \"Manderlay\" to protest the on-set killing of a donkey. His next role was in the Jennifer Connelly-led horror film \"Dark Water\" (2005) as the manager of a mysterious hotel.

Reilly co-starred alongside Ezra Miller and Oscar-winner Tilda Swinton in the British-American drama \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\", based on the novel by Lionel Shriver. His character in the film was Franklin, the father of the troubled Kevin; his performance was described as being \"heartbreakingly sweet\" by \"Slate\" critic Dana Stevens. Next, he co-starred in the comedy-drama \"Terri\" alongside Jacob Wysocki, playing a school principal who takes an interest in a teenage misfit.

Reilly was approached to appear in a production of the play it was based on, \"God of Carnage\", but he couldn't fit it into his schedule and remarked \"I think I've spent enough time in that apartment\".\n\nReilly voiced the title character in the 2012 Disney animated film \"Wreck-It Ralph\", which follows an arcade game villain who is determined to prove himself as the hero. Reilly made contributions to the film's script. The film was positively received, with \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Betsy Sharkey saying, \"The movie's subversive sensibility and old-school/new-school feel are a total kick.\" \"Wreck-It Ralph\" grossed over $471 million and a sequel titled \"\" is in development for a November 2018 release. Also that year, Reilly appeared in \"Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie\" as the dim-witted Taquito and made an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy \"The Dictator\", starring Sacha Baron Cohen.

Reilly appeared in the 2017 monster film reboot \"\", as Hank Marlow, a World War II lieutenant who has spent 28 years stranded on the titular island. The actor, who described his character as \"essentially a love-letter to Chicago\", was singled out for praise for his performance out of what is generally considered to be an underwhelming ensemble cast. Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted that Reilly \"steals the film instantly and never gives it back\" in playing the \"wisecracking castaway\", and Owen Gleiberman praised his performance for being \"terrifically dry and sly\" in what could have been a cliché character.\n\nReilly co-stars with Steve Coogan in the 2018 biopic \"Stan and Ollie\" about the comic double act Laurel and Hardy, with Reilly portraying Oliver Hardy and Coogan portraying Stan Laurel.

{"id": "340377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340377", "title": "Kanji Ishiwara", "text": "Kanji Ishiwara\n\nIshiwara was born in Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture, into a \"samurai\" class family. His father was a police officer, but as his clan had supported the Tokugawa bakufu and then the Northern Alliance during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, its members were shut out of higher government positions.\n\nAt 13, Ishiwara was enrolled in a military preparatory school. He was subsequently accepted at the 21st class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and graduated in 1909. He served in the IJA 65th Infantry Regiment in Korea after its annexation by Japan in 1910, and in 1915, he passed the exams for admittance to the 30th class of the Army Staff College. He graduated second in his class in 1918.\n\nIshiwara spent several years in various staff assignments and then was selected to study in Germany as a military attaché. He stayed in Berlin and in Munich from 1922 to 1925, focusing on military history and military strategy. He hired several former officers from the German General Staff to tutor him, and by the time that he returned to Japan, he had formed a considerable background on military theory and doctrine.\n\nPrior to leaving for Germany, Ishiwara had converted to Nichiren Buddhism. Nichiren had taught that a period of massive conflict would precede a golden era of human culture in which the truth of Buddhism would prevail. Japan would be the center and main promulgator of the faith, which would encompass the entire world. Ishiwara felt that the period of world conflict was fast approaching, and Japan, relying upon its vision of the \"kokutai\" and its sacred mission to \"liberate\" China, would lead a unified East Asia to defeat the West.\n\nIshiwara was also the leader of a semi-religious and Pan-Asianist organization, the East-Asia League Movement (\"Tōarenmei undō\").\n\nIshiwara was assigned to the Army Staff College as an instructor, followed by a staff position within the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. He arrived there at the end of 1928, some months after the assassination of Zhang Zuolin. Ishiwara quickly realized that the confused political situation in northern China, along with Japan's already significant economic investments in the area, provided the Kwantung Army with a unique opportunity. He and Colonel Seishiro Itagaki began formulating a plan to take advantage of the situation.\n\nOn 18 September 1931, a bomb was secretly planted on the tracks of the Japanese-controlled Southern Manchuria Railway by Kwantung Army elements. Charging that Chinese soldiers had attacked the rail line, Ishiwara ordered Japanese troops to seize the Chinese military barracks in the nearby city of Liutiaokou. He then ordered Kwantung Army units to seize control of all other Manchurian cities without informing the new commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, General Shigeru Honjo, or the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in Tokyo.\n\nThe sudden invasion of Manchuria alarmed political leaders in Japan, and brought condemnation down on the country from the international community. Ishiwara thought it most likely that he would be executed or at least dishonorably discharged for his insubordination. However, the success of the operation brought just the opposite. Ishiwara was admired by right-wing younger officers and ultranationalist societies for his daring and initiative. He returned to Japan and was given command of the IJA 4th Infantry Regiment in Sendai.\n\nIshiwara was appointed to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1935 as Chief of Operations, which gave him primary responsibility for articulating his vision for Japan's future. He was a strong proponent of pan-Asianism and the \"hokushin-ron\" (\"strike north\") philosophy, as opposed to the \"nanshin-ron\" (\"strike south\") philosophy espoused by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). The strike north view held that Japan should join with Manchukuo (the Japanese puppet state created out of occupied Manchuria in 1932) and China to form an \"East Asian League\", which would then prepare for and fight a war with the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union was defeated, Japan could move to the south to free Southeast Asia from European colonial rule. Following this victory, Japan would then be ready to tackle the United States.\n\nHowever, in order to implement these plans, Japan would need to build up its economy and military. Ishiwara envisioned a one-party \"national defense state\" with a command economy in which political parties were abolished and venal politicians and greedy businessmen removed from power.\n\nHowever, Ishiwara stopped short of calling for a Shōwa Restoration and violent overthrow of the government. When the February 26 Incident erupted in 1936, rebels assassinated a number of major politicians and government leaders and demanded a change in government in line with Ishiwara's philosophies. However, Ishiwara dashed their hopes by speaking out strongly against the rebellion and demanding proclamation of martial law. After Vice Chief of Staff Hajime Sugiyama pulled troops in from garrisons around Tokyo, Ishiwara was named Operations Officer of the Martial Law Headquarters.\n\nIn March 1937 Ishiwara was promoted to major general and transferred back to Manchukuo as Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. He discovered to his dismay that his Army colleagues had no intention of creating a new pan-Asian paradise, and were quite content to play the role of colonial occupiers. Ishiwara denounced the Kwantung Army leadership, and proposed that all officers take a pay cut. He confronted the Kwantung Army commander-in-chief, General Hideki Tojo, over his allocation of funds to an officers' wives club. After becoming an embarrassment to his seniors, he was relieved of command and reassigned to a local army base at Maizuru, on the seacoast near Kyoto.\n\nBack in Japan, he began to analyze Soviet tactics at Nomonhan, where Japanese forces were defeated, proposing counter-strategies to be adopted by the Army. He wrote and gave public addresses, continuing to advocate an East Asia League partnership with China and Manchukuo and continuing to oppose the invasion of China. He became a lieutenant general in 1939 and was assigned command of the IJA 16th Division.\n\nIshiwara's political nemesis, Tōjō, now risen to the highest ranks, felt that the outspoken Ishiwara should be retired from the Army, but feared the reactions of young officers and right-wing activists. Finally, after Ishiwara publicly denounced Tōjō as an enemy of Japan who should \"be arrested and executed,\" he was put on the retired list. Ishiwara went back to Yamagata, where he continued to write and study agriculture until the end of the war.\n\nAfter World War II, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers called upon Ishiwara as a witness for the defense in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. No charges were ever brought against Ishiwara himself, possibly due to his public opposition to Tōjō, the war in China, and the attack on Pearl Harbor. He displayed his old fire in front of the American prosecutor, arguing that U.S. President Harry S. Truman should be indicted for the mass bombing of Japanese civilians.\n\nIshiwara is a supporting character in the Japanese historical fantasy novel \"Teito Monogatari\" by Hiroshi Aramata.\n\nIshiwara is a prominent supporting character in the Japanese alternate history manga \"Zipang\" and also the anime version. His beliefs regarding the clash of civilizations between the East and the West, involvement in the Manchurian incident, views on Pan-Asianism, and perspectives on World War II form important parts of the plot.\n\nMurakami Haruki, in the novel \"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle\", also refers to Ishiwara as his strategic concept.\n\n"}

It instituted many charitable causes for Sikhs, was a landowner and politician in the Punjab during the British Raj.\n\nBedi was born in Kallar Syedan in the Rawalpindi District in 1832. He was said to be the thirteenth direct descendant of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism. His father Baba Attar Singh was killed in a family feud on 25 November 1839 and Bedi and his elder brother Sampuran Singh inherited jagirs in the Doaba region along with 41 villages in Depalpur Tehsil. Following the annexation of the Punjab by the East India Company in 1849, 14 of those villages were appropriated by the new administration.\n\nIn 1855, the Punjab administration established the Department of Public Instruction with the aim to open 30 single-teacher primary schools across the Punjab. Bedi lent his full support to the scheme, additionally opening his own schools in Rawalpindi. At least fifty schools for boys and girls were opened in the Punjab with his assistance. \n\nDuring the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Bedi helped British troops quell an uprising in Gugera. He distinguished himself in a cavalry charge on 21 September 1857, and the following day narrowly escaped an ambush which killed the Extra Assistant Commissioner of Gogera, Leopold Fitzhardinge Berkeley. Following the rebellion, he was given a robe of honour and a double barrelled rifle. \n\nOn 1 October 1873 he co-founded the Singh Sabha Movement in response to growing Christian, Islam, Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj proselytising in the Punjab region. The movement aimed to re-capture the original message of the Gurus and re-establish Sikh identity. It sought to address issues of personal identity, formulate theoretical concepts, reform social customs and give prominence to the Punjabi language in the Gurmukhi script of the Gurus. Within a decade 121 separate Singh Sabhas had emerged across the region.\n\nBedi was a Sanatan Sikh (lit. \"Traditional Sikh\"), who maintained that \"there were no essential differences between Sikhs and Hindus\". He opposed the movement led by Tat Khalsa (pure Khalsa) who sought to distinguish Sikhism and Hinduism.\n\nHe was appointed a magistrate in 1877 and made a Companion of the Indian Empire in 1879. On the occasion of his daughter's marriage in 1893, he donated Rs 3,00,000 for religious and charitable purposes. He was nominated to the Imperial Legislative Council in 1893 and became a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire in 1898.

They acquired Ol ari Nyiro, a cattle ranch in Western Laikipia, in Kenya's Great Rift Valley which she would later transform into a conservation park. Both her husband and son died in accidents within a few years.\n\nKuki decided to stay in Kenya and to work toward ecological conservation in the early '80s, becoming a Kenyan citizen. As a living memorial to Paolo and Emanuele, she established the Gallmann Memorial Foundation (GMF), which promotes coexistence of people and nature in Africa and is active in education, biodiversity research, habitat protection, reforestation, community service, peace and reconciliation, poverty alleviation and public health. GMF promotes environmental education of Kenyan students. She dedicated Ol ari Nyiro to this ideal, converting it into the Laikipia Nature Conservancy.\n\nGallmann has published five books, all global best-sellers. The first, her autobiography \"I Dreamed Of Africa\", became a feature film starring Kim Basinger and has been published in 24 countries and translated in 21 languages. Her other books are: African Nights, Il Colore del Vento, Night of the Lions, Elefanti in Giardino.\n\nTo bring attention to major environmental topics through art, in 2006 she founded the Great Rift Valley Trust together with her daughter Sveva and other Kenyan personalities. The Trust invites artists to create original fusion art with Kenyan 'slum' artists at the Laikipia Nature Conservancy. The Trust also co-produces the Laikipia Highlands Games, sports for peace, and the Earth Festival to help the environment.\n\nIn 2008, after Kenya's post-election violence, she founded the Laikipia Highlands Games (Sport for Peace) to put together, through peaceful but challenging competition of sports, youth across the ethnic, tribal and political divide. The LHG won for Kenya the 2009 Event of Year World Award by the Peace and Sport Foundation in Monaco. The LHG promotes peace through sports amongst previously warring tribes.\n\nIn 2010 she founded Prayers for the Earth, to involve local tribal elders and youth to recapture the traditional respect for the environment on which their livelihood depends, and reconnect to the Earth through traditional worship.\n\nIn 2011, with her daughter, she acquired and donated 300 acres for a model community project called \"Land of Hope\" in Laikipia West, which aims to benefit impoverished communities of the area. With support from Maisha Marefu, an Italian Onlus, the project was brought to life: a vocational centre for women and youth, a nursery school and feeding programme, a dispensary, and a high altitude athletics training centre are part of the scheme. This last athletics centre, in partnership with Martin Keino, of Keino Sports Marketing, was completed in 2013.\n\nSveva, her daughter, holds an MSc in Human Sciences from New College, Oxford and coordinates the award-winning 4 Generations Project, an educational scheme to proactively protect local endangered cultures, by bridging the inter-generational gap. Sveva is also leading several art projects and community projects amongst local tribes to promote peace and improve their living standards.\n\nDespite these circumstances, Kuki succeeded in maintaining Ol Ari Nyiro as a largely untainted reserve of scientific and cultural value. This is witnessed by the recognition of several important accreditations to Ol Ari Nyiro, including being recognized as a “Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot”, as one of UNEP World Designated Protected Areas (WDPA), and being officially declared an Important Bird Area (IBA) an area recognized as being globally important habitat for the conservation of birds populations, and as a KEY BIODIVERSITY AREA (KBA number 064) through\nNature Kenya and Birdlife International, a status recognized by the IUCN with the following definition: \"Key biodiversity areas are places of international importance for the conservation of biodiversity through protected areas and other governance mechanisms.\" Additionally, since 2015 Ol Ari Nyiro is part of Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association (KWCA 087). Not only is the Conservancy an area of outstanding natural beauty, but also, as a result of the\nprotection that has benefited for over forty years under Kuki’s guardianship, the natural springs were preserved and Ol Ari Nyiro now serves as the Water Tower for the Great Rift Valley Lakes. The Mukutan Gorge was defined by Professor Truman Young as “the most varied botanically non forested area in East Africa”\n\nThe Foundation proves that Africa can survive out of the ecological, creative and sustainable use of its natural resources. She transformed Ol ari Nyiro into a Nature Conservancy (LNC) managed holistically after selling the livestock. Due to relentless protection, Laikipia Nature Conservancy is a biodiversity oasis that supports and protects an extraordinary variety of plants and animals, the only pristine forest in the area, which includes endangered species such as elephants, cheetah, over 470 species of birds and rare and endemic plants and insects, in addition to archaeological sites.\n\n\n\nCo-Founder \n\nProjects, Buildings and creations\n\nOn 23 April 2017, Gallmann was attacked and shot by Pokot militia in the stomach when she was patrolling the Laikipia Nature Conservancy and was airlifted to Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi, for further treatment.\n\n"}

In the 1850s and 1860s he was one of the best known leaders of the Bedonkohe and Chihenne, along with Tudeevia (\"Dudeevia\", better known as \"Delgadito\" - \"Little Thin\", \"Skinny\"), Cuchillo Negro, Ponce and Loco (\"crazy\", \"mad\"). He was a nephew of Delgadito, and married a sister of Geronimo.\n\nCaptain John Gregory Bourke described Nana as having \"a strong face marked with intelligence, courage and good nature, but with an under stratum of cruelty and vindictiveness\". Charles Fletcher Lummis claimed that Nana wore gold watch chains in each ear lobe, presumably taken from dead victims.\n\nHe fought alongside Mangas Coloradas and his mixed Tchihende-Bedonkohe band until Mangas Coloradas was killed while in the custody of the California Column in January 1863. In Mexico he undertook many joint raids with the Nednhi of Juh and Natiza against the Mexicans. After Ponce, Cuchillo Negro and Delgadito were killed too, Victorio took over the Tchihende leadership, joined by the leaderless Bedonkohe (Taklishim, old Mahko's son, had not been able to save his father's leadership in front of his competitors Mano Mocha and Luis). Nana, although at least 20 years older than Victorio, married the latter's elder sister, cementing his position as a leader.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to peacefully live on a reservation in their own country, Victorio and Nana gave up trying and fought back against the Americans and Mexicans. The Bedonkohe and Chihenne were joined by more than 80 warriors of the Mescalero Apache under their old chief Caballero. Victorio and Nana therefore had about 200 warriors.\n\nDuring the Apache Wars and especially Victorio's War Nana raided areas of Texas and Mexico with Victorio. While Nana and a small group was away on a scouting mission, Victorio and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army under Joaquin Terrazas at the Battle of Tres Castillos in October 1880. 68 women and children were captured by the Mexicans and sold as slaves in Mexico.\n\nAfter Victorio's death, Nana and his followers hid in the Sierra Madre. Several prestigious leaders and warriors, such as Fun (\"Yiy-gholl\", \"Yiy-joll\", \"Yiy-zholl\", also known as \"Larry Fun\"), Ka-ya-ten-nae (\"Ka-e-te-nay\", \"Kadhateni\" or \"Kieta\" - \"Fights Without Arrows\", \"Cartridges All Gone\") took the leadership of the Tchihende, Bedonkohe, Tsokanende and Nednhi bands beside the already established Apache band leaders Nana, Loco, Mangas, Naiche, Geronimo and Juh.\n\nNana, now almost 80 years old (according to some reports, nearly 90-years), formed his own war party with the Chihenne (Warm Springs Apache), enlisting loitering warriors in the reservations. His band joined by 15 Tsokanende, 12 Mescalero warriors and a couple of Navajo, plus women and children, began raiding Army supply trains and isolated settlers. In less than a month Nana fought seven or eight battles stretching over the course of 1,000 miles and killed 30-40 Americans, at least as many Mexicans, captured about 200 horses to replace 100 ridden to death and then fled back to Mexico. He and his small force, evaded more than 1,000 soldiers, 300-400 civilian militia volunteers and Apache and Navajo Indian Scouts.\n\nNana survived the Apache Wars. Upon surrender in March 1886 he, other Apache warriors and Apache Scouts were sent as prisoners of war to Florida and Alabama. In 1894, they were relocated to Fort Sill in the Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. Nana died of natural causes in 1896.\n\nNana has a special reputation among Apache war chiefs. He was still an active warrior well into his eighties. He had tenacity, stamina, courage and an uncanny ability to improvise in a fight to minimize his losses. He showed no mercy in battle, yet could be considerate when dealing with civilians. When Nana was executing guerrilla tactics in the 1880's, he was half blind, crooked from arthritis, but once he sat in the saddle, he rode \"like the devil.\" \n\n\n"}

Underwood was born in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. Described as \"an indefatigable ghost hunter\", he wrote many books which surveyed alleged hauntings within the United Kingdom - beginning the trend of comprehensive regional 'guides' to (purportedly) haunted places. One of his well-known investigations concerned Borley Rectory, which he also wrote about.\n\nBorn into a family who were Plymouth Brethren, Underwood had his first paranormal experience at the age of nine, when he claimed to have seen an apparition of his father, who had died earlier the same day, standing at the bottom of his bed. During his childhood, his maternal grandparents lived for a time at Rosehall, a seventeenth century Hertfordshire house which it was claimed was haunted, supposedly having a bedroom in which guests claimed to have seen the figure of a headless man. Underwood's interest in hauntings and psychic matters began to take root at that time.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, Underwood joined the publishing firm of J.M. Dent & Sons in Letchworth Garden City. In January 1942 he was called up for active service with the Suffolk Regiment. After collapsing at a rifle range at Bury St Edmunds, Underwood was diagnosed with a serious chest ailment which rendered him unfit for active service. He was discharged from the army and returned to Dents. On 15 July 1944 Underwood married his wife Joyce at St. Mary's Church in nearby Baldock (she died in 2003 after having suffered with Parkinson's Disease for 14 years).\n\nUnderwood was much influenced by the work of Harry Price - the grandfather of ghost-hunting - and was particularly struck by Price's ‘The End of Borley Rectory’, which he read immediately when it was first published in 1946. Investigating Borley himself, he corresponded with Price about it. Price then invited Underwood to join the Ghost Club , of which he would later become President.\n\nDuring his investigations into the Borley Rectory case, over a period of years, Underwood traced and personally interviewed almost every living person who had been connected with what the press had dubbed the 'most haunted house in England'. He built up a volume of correspondence with paranormal investigator Harry Price and after Price's death, Paul Tabori would become literary executor of the Harry Price Estate, with whom Underwood worked with to publish all his research into Borley. (Price had written published two books about Borley- \"The Most Haunted House in England\" (1940), and \"The End of Borley Rectory\" (1946), from which Underwood 'compile[d] a really comprehensive index of the combined volumes'.)\n\nUnderwood's published work changed the field of literature on the paranormal. For example, his much imitated \"Gazetteer of British Ghosts\" (1971) and \"Haunted London\" (1973) - previously unheard of comprehensive and well-researched surveys (or geographical dictionaries - gazetteers) - which, through their encyclopaedic thoroughness, imparted authority to Underwood as an author on the subject he devoted his life to - ghost hunting. They also encouraged others to use them as resources to use to visit the sites he investigated for themselves. Underwood came to be known as a 'veteran psychical researcher ... representing the middle-ground between scepticism and uncritical belief'; the 'Sherlock Holmes of psychical research' - as Dame Jean Conan Doyle would say (when introducing him).\n\nIn their book \"Ghosts of Borley\" (1973), Underwood and Paul Tabori wrote that they believed \"some of the phenomena were genuine\" at the Borley Rectory. The researcher Trevor H. Hall criticized Tabori and Underwood for selective reporting. According to Hall, the alleged paranormal phenomena from the rectory were the result of natural causes, such as noises produced by rats or flying bats, pranks by local village boys throwing stones at the house, or tramps trying to keep warm by lighting small fires in the rectory.\n\nIn his book \"No Common Task: The Autobiography of a Ghost-Hunter\" (1983), Underwood came to the conclusion after years of investigation that 98% of the reports of ghosts and hauntings are likely to have naturalistic explanations such as misidentification, hallucination or pranks and he was most interested in the 2% of the phenomena that he believed may be genuine.\n\nUnderwood was a long-standing member of the Society for Psychical Research. For some years Underwood was the Honorary Librarian of the Constitutional Club and the Savage Club, where he was a former Member of the Qualifications Committee. In 1976 a bust of Underwood was sculpted by Patricia Finch, winner of the Gold Medal for Sculpture in Venice (it currently resides with the Savage Club).\n\nIn 2018, a website was published dedicated to chronicling his life and work.\n\nHaving been invited to join the Ghost Club by Harry Price, Underwood was its President from 1960 to 1993. In 1994, Underwood formed the Ghost Club Society which was formed after his departure from the Ghost Club. Membership to the Ghost Club Society was by invitation only. It was reported that the group had several hundred members. Quarterly newsletters were published to members and regular meetings held around the United Kingdom.\n\nIn recognition of his more than seventy years of paranormal investigations - Dame Jean Conan Doyle described him as 'The Sherlock Holmes of Psychical Research' - Underwood accepted the invitation to be the Patron of The Ghost Research Foundation (founded in Oxford in 1992), which termed him the \"King of Ghost Hunters\". In 2000 Underwood was contacted by Clark R. Schmidt, Doctor of Esoteric Sciences from Celestial Visions School of Metaphysical Arts in Fort Lauderdale (founded in 1994) Florida, to become a lifelong member of the Universal Parapsychological and Metaphysical Association (founded in 1996) - which he accepted and shortly before his death he accepted an invitation to be the Patron of Paranormal Site Investigators (UK).\n\n\n"}

In 1946, he was appointed Member of the Interim Government for Works, Mines and Powers – the position of a minister in a national executive council led by Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and presided over by the Viceroy of India.\n\nHowever, Bose resigned from the AICC in disagreement over the Cabinet Mission Plan's call to partition Bengal between Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority regions. He attempt to construct a bid for a united but independent Bengal and North-East with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Bengali Muslim League leader. Muhammad Ali Jinnah (President of the Muslim League who would become Pakistan's founding father) supported it and so did Mahatma Gandhi. The Indian National Congress and the Hindu members of Indian Legislative Council from Bengal opposed it. (History of Bengal by R. C. Mazumder) After India's independence, Bose would lead his brother's Forward Bloc and form the Socialist Republican Party, advocating a socialist system for Bengal and India. He died in 1950, in Calcutta.\n\nSarat Bose married Bivabati Devi in 1910 and the couple had eight children. Their children included Dr. Asoke Nath Bose, a Doctorate in Chemistry from Germany and eminent engineer, Amiya Nath Bose who participated in the Quit India Movement, became a Member Parliament and was also the Indian ambassador to Burma, Sisir Kumar Bose, who became a pediatrician and Member of Legislative Assembly, and Subrata Bose, who was an electrical engineer and also a Member of Parliament. His youngest daughter Prof. Chitra Ghosh is a distinguished academician and a social scientist and also a member of the parliament. His grandson, Sumantra Bose, is a professor of comparative politics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\nIn January 2014, Sarat Chandra Bose Memorial Lecture was instituted and the maiden lecture was delivered by international historian Leonard A. Gordon, who has penned a joint biography of Sarat and his younger brother Subhas, titled \"Brothers Against The Raj\". A statue of Sarat Chandra Bose is situated beside Calcutta High Court.\n\n"}

He gained national attention in 2007, at age nine, for escaping from his home in Lakewood to San Antonio, Texas on his own, traveling by car as a driver and by airplane as a passenger. Booker grew up to become a standout high school basketball player, attending four different schools, including Curtis Senior High School and Clover Park High School. He currently plays for the Seattle Ballers of the Junior Basketball Association (JBA).\n\nBooker was born to Sakinah Booker, a single mother, and had three brothers, including Demarius, and a younger sister. According to his mother, he regularly attempted to escape his mother's apartment in Lakewood, Washington to be with a father figure in his grandfather, who lived in Dallas, Texas. Booker's mother also claimed that he \"hated\" his neighborhood. \n\nOn January 14, 2008, he stole a 1986 Acura car from a neighbor, driving it up to 90 miles per hour (145 km/h)— having learned the skill through video games— before crashing during a police chase. In the following morning, after being excused from juvenile detention, Booker traveled to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport on a bus, without his mother's knowledge. He received a boarding pass from Southwest Airlines for a flight to San Antonio, Texas via Phoenix, Arizona, after lying that he was a 12-year-old with the last name \"Williams\" and that his mother was already in the boarding area. However, in San Antonio, he was stopped after attempting to board another flight to Dallas. \n\nThe incident gained the attention of Norm Dicks, the local U. S. Representative, who said, \"If a 9-year-old can exploit this (air travel) security system, we are going to have to look into the procedures.\" \"The Washington Post\" labeled Booker possibly \"the most persistent, most creative and most publicized 9-year-old runaway in the history of the Pacific Northwest,\" while \"Time\" magazine included him in an article about \"5 Amazing Runaway Kid Stories\" alongside Harry Houdini and Benjamin Franklin. Booker was additionally featured on Dr. Phil and Inside Edition.\n\nBooker was later involved in another runaway attempt to Texas through the SeaTac/Airport station. Additional actions put him in juvenile detention and eventually led to him and his siblings being placed a foster home. Booker later escaped from his foster home, eventually returning to his mother's home. In his middle school years, during which he lived in Texas and North Carolina, Booker began playing organized basketball.\n\nThroughout his high school tenure, he would go to four different campuses in Washington, at least one per each year of a regular high school tenure. In his sophomore season, he played for Lincoln High School in Tacoma. As a junior, he transferred to Curtis Senior High School in University Place, Washington. He also worked part-time as a referee at the time. He received a letter of interest from San Diego State University while at Curtis. Before his 18th birthday at the end of his junior year, he wast involved with a serious fight that led to his suspension from school, and he attended summer school at Oakland Alternative High School in Tacoma. In his senior year, Booker transferred to Clover Park High School in Lakewood, Washington. He gained interest from both Tacoma Community College and Evergreen State College, but Booker veered away from those places, eventually stopping himself from going to classes at Clover Park altogether at one point. He projected to go to a preparatory school in Illinois to finish high school properly, but couldn't in part because of the birth of his son, Mathayus King Blue-Booker, on December 22, 2016, and partially because of an arrest he had in February 2017, which would lead to a court case on July that year; the case relating to his latest arrest is currently unresolved.\n\nBefore making the move to play professionally, Booker played in a recreational league. On April 7, 2018, Booker would be one of about 50 or 100 people to officially travel to Garfield High School to tryout for the Seattle Ballers, one of eight teams created for the newly founded Junior Basketball Association (JBA). After the tryouts for Seattle concluded, Booker was named one of four players (at the time) to be confirmed for the newly formed team. He would make his professional debut for the JBA on June 23 against the Dallas Ballers at the H&PE Arena in Houston, Texas. In that game, he recorded 12 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, a steal, and a block as a starter in a blowout 121–103 win over the Dallas Ballers. In his next game a day later, he went on to become a bench player for Seattle in a 150–145 loss to the Los Angeles Ballers, which featured premiere player LaMelo Ball.\n\n"}

{"id": "303285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303285", "title": "Thomas Blood", "text": "Thomas Blood\n\nColonel Thomas Blood (1618 – 24 August 1680) was an Anglo-Irish officer and self-styled colonel best known for his attempt to steal the Crown Jewels of England from the Tower of London in 1671. Described in an American source as a \"noted bravo and desperado,\" he was known for his attempt to kidnap and, later, to kill, his enemy, the Duke of Ormonde. He had switched allegiances from Royalist to Roundhead during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and despite his subsequent notoriety received a Royal free pardon and found favour at the court of King Charles II.\n\nSources suggest that Blood was born in County Clare, in the Kingdom of Ireland, the son of a successful land-owning blacksmith of English descent, and was partly raised at Sarney, near Dunboyne, in County Meath. He was apparently a Presbyterian. His family was respectable and prosperous (by the standards of the time); his father held lands in the Counties Clare, Meath and Wicklow. His grandfather was a member of the Irish Parliament, and had lived at Kilnaboy Castle (also in County Clare). He received his education in Lancashire, England. At the age of 20, he married Maria Holcroft, the daughter of John Holcroft, a gentleman from Golborne, Lancashire, and returned to Ireland.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, Blood returned to England and initially took up arms with the Royalist forces loyal to Charles I. As the conflict progressed he switched sides and became a lieutenant in Oliver Cromwell's Roundheads. In 1653 at the cessation of hostilities Cromwell awarded Blood land grants as payment for his service and appointed him a justice of the peace. Following the Restoration of King Charles II to the Crowns of the Three Kingdoms in 1660, Blood fled with his family to Ireland. The confiscations and restitutions under the Act of Settlement 1662 (which sought to cancel and annul some of the grants of land and real properties allocated as reward to new holders being Cromwellians under the Act of Settlement 1652) brought Blood to financial ruin, and in return Blood sought to unite his fellow Cromwellians in Ireland to cause insurrection.\n\nAs part of the expression of discontent, Blood conspired to storm Dublin Castle, usurp the government, and kidnap James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, for ransom. On the eve of the attempt, the plot was foiled. Blood managed to evade the authorities by hiding with his countrymen in the mountains, and ultimately managed to escape to the United Dutch Provinces in the Low Country. A few of Blood's collaborators were captured and executed. As a result, some historians speculated that Blood swore vengeance against Ormonde.\n\nWhile in the Dutch Republic, Blood gained the favour of Admiral de Ruyter, an opponent of the English forces in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, and was implicated in the Scottish Pentland Rising of 1666 by the Scottish Presbyterian Covenanters. At some point during this period, Blood became associated with the wealthy George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who 19th-century commentators believed used Blood as a means to punish his own political and social adversaries, since his own class ranking did not allow him to meet them \"in the field\".\n\nIn 1670, despite his status as a wanted man, Blood returned to England and is believed to have taken the name Ayloffe and practised as a doctor or an apothecary in Romford Market, east of London. A second attempt, this time on the life of the Duke of Ormonde, followed.\n\nSince Ormonde's return to England, he had taken up residence at Clarendon House. Blood had followed Ormonde's movements and noted that he frequently returned late in the evening accompanied by a small number of footmen. On the night of 6 December 1670, Blood and his accomplices attacked Ormonde while the latter travelled St James's Street. Ormonde was dragged from his coach, bound to one of Blood's henchmen, and taken on horseback along Piccadilly with the intention of hanging him at Tyburn. The gang pinned a paper to Ormonde's chest spelling out their reasons for his capture and murder. With one of his servants who had given chase on horseback, Ormonde succeeded in freeing himself and escaped. The plot's secrecy meant that Blood was not suspected of the crime, despite a reward being offered for the capture of the attempted assassins. In the King's presence, James's son, Thomas Butler, accused the Duke of Buckingham of being behind the crime. Thomas threatened to shoot Buckingham dead in revenge, if his father, James, was murdered.\n\nBlood did not lie low for long, and within six months he made his notorious attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. In April or May 1671 he visited the Tower of London dressed as a parson and accompanied by a female companion pretending to be his wife. The Crown Jewels could be viewed by the payment of a fee to the custodian. While viewing the Crown Jewels, Blood's \"wife\" feigned a stomach complaint and begged the newly appointed Master of the Jewel House, 77-year-old Talbot Edwards, to fetch her some spirits. Given the proximity of the jewel keeper's domestic quarters to the site of the commotion, Edwards' wife invited them upstairs to their apartment to recover, after which Blood and his wife thanked the Edwardses and left.\n\nOver the following days Blood returned to the Tower to visit the Edwardses and presented Mrs Edwards with four pairs of white gloves as a gesture of thanks. As Blood became ingratiated with the family, an offer was made for a fictitious nephew of Blood's to marry the Edwardses' daughter, who, Blood alleged, would be eligible, by virtue of the marriage, to an income of several hundred pounds.\n\nOn 9 May 1671, in furtherance of the deception, Blood convinced Edwards to show the jewels to him, his supposed nephew, and two of his friends while they waited for a dinner that Mrs Edwards was to put on for Blood and his companions. The jewel keeper's apartment was in Martin Tower above a basement where the jewels were kept behind a metal grille. Reports suggest that Blood's accomplices carried canes that concealed rapier blades, daggers, and pocket pistols. In entering the Jewel House, one of the men made a pretence of standing watch outside while the others joined Edwards and Blood. The door was closed and a cloak thrown over Edwards, who was struck with a mallet, knocked to the floor, bound, gagged and stabbed to subdue him.\n\nAfter removing the grille, Blood used the mallet to flatten St. Edward's Crown so that he could hide it beneath his clerical coat. Another conspirator, Blood's brother-in-law Hunt, filed the Sceptre with the Cross in two (as it did not fit in their bag), while the third man, Perrot, stuffed the Sovereign's Orb down his trousers. Meanwhile Edwards refused to stay subdued and fought against his bindings. Accounts vary as to whether Edwards' struggle caused sufficient disturbance to raise the alarm or whether the attempt was foiled in more fortuitous circumstances.\n\nPopular reports describe Edwards' son, Wythe, returning from military service in Flanders, happening upon the attempted theft. At the door of the Jewel House, Wythe was met by the impromptu guard, who challenged him, before the young Edwards entered and went upstairs. The \"guard\" then alerted his fellow gang members. At around the same time, the elder Edwards managed to free his gag, and raised the alarm shouting, \"Treason! Murder! The crown is stolen!\"\n\nAs Blood and his gang fled to their horses waiting at St Catherine's Gate, they dropped the sceptre and fired on the warders who attempted to stop them, wounding one. One drawbridge guard was struck with fear and failed to discharge his musket. As they ran along the Tower wharf it is said they joined the calls for alarm to confuse the guards until they were chased down by Captain Beckman, brother-in-law of the younger Edwards. Although Blood shot at him, he missed and was captured before reaching the Iron Gate. Having fallen from his cloak, the crown was found while Blood refused to give up, struggling with his captors and declaring, \"It was a gallant attempt, however unsuccessful! It was for a crown!\" The globe and orb were recovered although several stones were missing and others were loose. Hunt and Perrot were also taken, but not punished.\n\nFollowing his capture, Blood refused to answer to anyone but the King and was consequently taken to the palace in chains, where he was questioned by King Charles, Prince Rupert, and others. King Charles asked Blood, \"What if I should give you your life?\", and Blood replied, \"I would endeavour to deserve it, Sire!\"\nTo the disgust of Ormonde, Blood was not only pardoned but also given land in Ireland worth £500 a year. In contrast, Edwards' family was awarded less than £300 by the King, a sum which was never paid in full, and he returned to his duties at the Tower regaling visitors with his tales of the attempted theft. He died in 1674 and his tomb rests in the chapel of St Peter's Ad Vincula, at the Tower of London. \n\nThe reasons for the King's pardon are unknown. Some historians have speculated that the King may have feared an uprising in revenge by followers of Blood, who were thought to have taken an oath to their leader. Others speculate that the King had a fondness for audacious scoundrels such as Blood, and that he was amused by the Irishman's claim that the jewels were worth only £6,000 as opposed to the £100,000 at which the Crown had valued them.\n\nThere is also a suggestion that the King was flattered and amused by Blood's revelation that he had previously intended to kill him while he was bathing in the Thames but had been swayed otherwise, having found himself in \"awe of majesty.\" It has also been suggested that his actions may have had the connivance of the king, because the King was very short of money at the time.\n\nFollowing his pardon, Blood became a familiar figure around London and made frequent appearances at Court, where he was employed to advocate in the claims of suitors to the Crown. In John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester's \"History of Insipids\", he wrote of Blood:\n\nIn 1679 Blood fell into dispute with the Duke of Buckingham, his former patron, and Buckingham sued Blood for £10,000, for insulting remarks Blood had made about his character. In the proceedings that followed, Blood was convicted by the King's Bench in 1680 and granted bail, although he never paid the damages.\n\nBlood was released from prison in July 1680 but had fallen into a coma by 22 August. He died on 24 August at his home in Bowling Alley, Westminster. His body was buried in the churchyard of St Margaret's Church (now Christchurch Gardens) near St. James's Park. It is believed that his body was exhumed by the authorities for confirmation: such was his reputation for trickery, it was suspected he might have faked his death and funeral to avoid paying his debt to Buckingham. Blood's epitaph read:\n\nBlood's son Holcroft Blood became a distinguished military engineer rising to the rank of Brigadier-General; he commanded the Duke of Marlborough's artillery at the Battle of Blenheim. Descendants including General Bindon Blood, civil engineer William Bindon Blood, Maurice Petherick, and Brian Inglis, had distinguished careers in British and Irish society.\n\n\n\n"}

He created and commanded the 2nd South Middlesex Rifle Volunteers in 1859, the nucleus of which was formed from members of the Ranelagh Yacht Club. Ranelagh became a \"de facto\" leader of the Volunteer movement and was introduced as such to the French emperor Napoleon III. In 1863 Ranelagh helped to organise a show of force in Brighton at which he gave a speech defending the movement from attempts by the government to take control of it. He insisted that an independent volunteer militia was both cheaper and more effective for the country than a centrally organised force. He asserted that the English character prefers independence and distrusts \"organisation\", claiming that \"we trust to our own pluck, that indomitable pluck that all Englishmen possess\". At this period Ranelagh was calling for a volunteer \"people's army\", an aspiration supported by a section of the press at the time. He continued to command the Volunteers until his death in 1885.\n\nRanelagh started a relationship with Annie Miller when her fiancé William Holman Hunt was away in the Middle East. He was described in the letters of Hunt and his friends as a \"notorious rake\" because of his womanising. When Hunt learned of the relationship he broke off the engagement, leading to a meeting between Annie and Ranelagh in which he suggested that she should sue Hunt for breach of promise. In the end, she married Ranelagh's cousin.\n\nRanelagh was also responsible for introducing Lillie Langtry to London high society. According to Langtry herself \"he completely changed the current of my life\". She became the centre of attention at a party to which he invited her, and was asked by both John Everett Millais and Frank Miles to sit for a portrait. \n\nWith his partner, Ranelagh had two daughters, but no sons. The titles of Viscount Ranelagh and Baron Jones of Navan became extinct upon his death in 1885.\n\nJones had two prominent relatives from his maternal grandmother:\n\nHis sister Barbara married Count von Rechberg (1806-1899), Foreign Minister of Austria, 1859-1864.\n"}

He was the first son of David Nelligan, who arrived in Quebec from Dublin, Ireland at the age of 12. His mother was Émilie Amanda Hudon, from Rimouski, Quebec. He had two sisters, Béatrice and Gertrude.\n\nA follower of Symbolism, he produced poetry profoundly influenced by Octave Crémazie, Louis Fréchette, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Georges Rodenbach, Maurice Rollinat and Edgar Allan Poe. A precocious talent like Arthur Rimbaud, he published his first poems in Montreal at the age of 16.\n\nIn 1899, Nelligan began to exhibit odd behavior. He was said to have loudly recited poetry to passing strangers and slept in chapels. He was also experiencing hallucinations and he attempted suicide. He was committed to a mental hospital at the request of his parents. There he was diagnosed with dementia praecox (now more commonly referred to as schizophrenia). He did not write any poetry after being hospitalized.\n\nAt the time, rumor and speculation suggested that he went insane because of the vast cultural and language differences between his mother and father. In recent years, however, a number of literary critics have postulated that Nelligan was gay. Some of these sources suggest that he became mentally ill due to inner conflict between his sexuality and his religious upbringing, while others suggest that he never went insane at all, but was involuntarily committed to the asylum by his family for homophobic reasons. No biographical sources published during Nelligan's lifetime contain any confirmed record of Nelligan having had any sexual or romantic relationships with either men or women, although some posthumous sources have suggested that he may have been the lover of poet Arthur de Bussières. Within the \"École littéraire de Montréal\" circle with which both Nelligan and Bussières were associated, it was widely believed that Nelligan was confined to the asylum because his mother discovered him and Bussières in bed together, although this claim was not widely publicized until the late 20th century and remains unconfirmed. Conversely, the 1991 biographical film \"Nelligan\" depicts Nelligan as nearly asexual, portraying him as sexually ambivalent in the face of romantic attractions to both Bussières and feminist activist Idola Saint-Jean, and implying that his mother attempted to commit incest with him.\n\nIn 1903, his collected poems were published to great acclaim in Canada. He may not have been aware that he was counted among French Canada's greatest poets.\n\nOn his death in 1941, Nelligan was interred in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in Montreal, Quebec. Following his death, the public became increasingly interested in Nelligan. His incomplete work spawned a kind of romantic legend. He was first translated into English in 1960 by P.F. Widdows. In 1983, Fred Cogswell translated all his poems in \"The Complete Poems of Émile Nelligan\". In the fall of 2017, Montreal's Vehicle Press will be releasing Marc di Saverio's English translations of Nelligan, Ship of Gold: The Essential Poems of Emile Nelligan.\n\nNelligan is considered one of the greatest poets of French Canada. Several schools and libraries in Quebec are named after him, and Hotel Nelligan is a four-star hotel in Old Montreal at the corner of Rue St. Paul and Rue St. Sulpice.\n\nIn her 2013 book \"Le Naufragé du Vaisseau d'or\", Yvette Francoli claimed that Louis Dantin, the publisher of Nelligan's poems, was in fact their real author. This claim was also previously advanced by Claude-Henri Grignon in his 1936 essay \"Les Pamphlets de Valdombre\", although Dantin himself denied having had anything more than an editing role in the poems' creation. In 2016, the University of Ottawa's literary journal \"@nalyses\" published an article by Annette Hayward and Christian Vandendorpe which rejected the claim, based on textual comparisons of the poetry credited to Nelligan with the writings of Dantin.\n\nJe remarquais toujours ce grand Jésus de plâtre\nDressé comme un pardon au seuil du vieux couvent,\nÉchafaud solennel à geste noir, devant\nLequel je me courbais, saintement idolâtre.\n\nOr, l'autre soir, à l'heure où le cri-cri folâtre,\nPar les prés assombris, le regard bleu rêvant,\nRécitant Eloa, les cheveux dans le vent,\nComme il sied à l'Éphèbe esthétique et bellâtre,\n\nJ'aperçus, adjoignant des débris de parois,\nUn gigantesque amas de lourde vieille croix\nEt de plâtre écroulé parmi les primevères;\n\nEt je restai là, morne, avec les yeux pensifs,\nEt j'entendais en moi des marteaux convulsifs\nRenfoncer les clous noirs des intimes Calvaires!\n\nTranslation by Konrad Bongard\n\n\"The gypsum Jesus always stalled me in my stepsLike a curse at the old convent door;Crouching meekly, I bend to exalt an idolWhose forgiveness I do not implore.\"\n\n\"Not long ago, at the crickets' hour, I roamed dimMeadows in a restful reverieReciting 'Eloa', with my hair worn by the windAnd no audience save for the trees.\"\n\n\"But now, as I lie with knees bent beneath Christ's scaffold,I see his crumbling mortar crossWith its plaster buried in the roses, and am saddened -\"\n\n\"For if I listen close enough, I can almost hearThe sound of coal-black nails being wrung inTo his wrists, the savage piercing of Longinus' spear.\"\n\nSeveral schools and libraries of Quebec bear the name of Émile Nelligan. Since 1979 the Prix Émile-Nelligan has rewarded the authors of a French-language poetry book written by a young poet in North America.\n\nOn June 7, 2005, the Fondation Émile-Nelligan and the City of Montreal inaugurated a bust to his memory in the Carré Saint-Louis. Another monument to his memory stands in Quebec City.\n\nThe poetry of Nelligan inspired numerous music composers:\n\n\n\n\n\nOn his work and life\n\n\nAmerican classical composer John Craton utilized five of Nelligan's poems in the song cycle \"Jardin sentimental\" (2004).\n\n"}
