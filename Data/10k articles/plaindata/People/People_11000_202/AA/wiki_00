As the originator of the Olympics, the Greek team entered first. Other teams entered in alphabetical order based on the names of countries in the Korean language. Following tradition, the delegation from the host nation, South Korea, was scheduled to enter last. However, following solidarity negotiations with North Korea, the host nation was instead represented by the unified Korean delegation, consisting of the South Korean and North Korean teams, marching under the Korean Unification Flag. The names of the nations were announced in French, followed by English and Korean, the official languages of the Olympic movement and the host nation, in accordance with traditional and International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines. Background music included such songs as K-pop hits as \"Gangnam Style\" by Psy, \"Likey\" by Twice, \"Fantastic Baby\" by Big Bang, \"DNA\" by BTS, and \"Red Flavor\" by Red Velvet. \n\nBelow is a list of parading countries and their announced flag bearer, in the same order as the parade.

{"id": "47556770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47556770", "title": "Andrzej Niemojewski", "text": "Andrzej Niemojewski\n\nAndrzej Niemojewski (24 January 1864 – 3 November 1921) was a Polish social and political activist, poet, rationalist and writer of the Young Poland period.\n\nNiemojewski was best known as a proponent of the Christ myth theory. He was the author of \"Gott Jesus im Lichte fremder und eigener Forschungen samt Darstellung der evangelischen Astralstoffe, Astralszenen und Astralsysteme\" (1910). The book was translated in 1996 as \"God Jesus: The Sun, Moon and Stars as Background to the Gospel Stories\" (1910).\n\nAlbert Schweitzer added two new chapters in the 1913 second edition of his \"Quest of the Historical Jesus\". (\"Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung\", 2. Auflage, 1913) which features \"God Jesus\" in one chapter.\n\n\nArthur Drews featured \"God Jesus\" in his 1926 work, \"The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present\" ;A. Niemojewski's main book appeared in 1910. It also shows a divine Jesus preceding any rumours about a human one. Contradictions in the Gospel tales prove that they are impossibly about one and the same person -- especially the sayings aren't from a single person. The sayings are co-opted from Jewish common sources and stuffed into the mouth of the alleged master Jesus.\n\nThe most important part of the Gospels, besides the logia, are miracles. One can't neglect them as the liberal Jesus proponents do, without destroying Christian scripture. Miracles are proofs for the divinity of Jesus. Falsely so-called proofs about the human Jesus, like Flavius Josephus, are easily dismissed as chatty hearsays or interpolations.\n\nNiemojewski continues the line of Volney and Dupuis, by looking for parallels in astral mythology. The Tanakh and Talmud are already full of astral mythological images, like the 12 Jewish tribes and sons of Jacob. Even more, of course, the New Testament. This is seen strongest in the Apocalypse of John. The twin myth, applied to Jesus and John, is especially interesting for Niemojewski. The constellation of Gemini plays a central role for Niemojewski. The astral mythological elements are strongest in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke; Mark contains them only quite marginally.\n\nIn the end, Niemojewski's system was too confusing to get much consideration, when compared to simpler astral mythical interpretations.\n\nIn the Appendix of \"The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus\", Drews writes ;\nIf we substitute for the “crucified” Orion of the twenty-second psalm the two other important celestial crosses the vernal cross with the Earn (Lamb) and the autumnal cross with the Cup (skull) below it, the Virgin, Berenice's Hair (\"megaddela\"=Mary Magdalene), etc.—we have all the astral elements of what Niemojewski calls the “astral \"via dolorosa\"” (p. 413). May we suppose, in fine, that Orion itself plays the part of the crucified Saviour? In that case the (weeping) women at the cross are represented by the Pleiades (the “rainsisters”), one of which bears the name of Maja (Maria). The Pleiades also are hair-dressers (\"megaddela\"), as they are represented in medieval manuscripts on the basis of an old tradition, and they culminate when Berenice's Hair rises above the eastern horizon. Electra is supposed to be the centre of the Pleiades. She is the mother of Jasios (Jesus), and is represented as a mourner with a cloth over her head, just in the same way as the Christian Mary. But as Jasios was also regarded, according to another genealogy, as the son of Maja, the mourning Pleiad may also stand for her. As is known, the mother of Jesus also is a dove (\"peleids\", Pleiad) in the early Christian conception. \n\nAccording to Niemojewski, the cup (\"gulguleth\"= skull) represents the heavenly Golgotha. But we may refer it to the skull of the Bull and the head of Medusa, and regard “the place of skulls” as the region of the heavens where Orion is found. On this supposition the two evil-doers are recognised in the Twins, which we have already ascertained to be the astral criminals. Castor is regarded as evil on account of his relation to winter, and Pollux good on account of his relation to summer. Niemojewski sees the two evil-doers in the Dogs (Sirius and Procyon). The difference is not great, as the Dogs culminate at the same time as the Twins, and may therefore be substituted for them. \n\nHere we have firm ground on which to establish the originally astral and mythical character of the remainder of the story of Jesus, and we seem to have a very strong proof that there was a cult of “the crucified” before the time of Jesus, and that the nucleus of the figure of Jesus is in reality purely astral. \n\nAll the oriental religions, including Judaism, are essentially astral religions. We have previously (p. 223) shown that \"Revelation\" is a Jewish-Gnostic work, the Jesus of which is more primitive than the Jesus of the gospels. But \"Revelation\" is entirely and certainly of an astral character. It is a further proof that Christianity is no exception to the rule.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21354274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21354274", "title": "Beatification of Pope John Paul II", "text": "Beatification of Pope John Paul II\n\nPope John Paul II reigned as pope of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State for 26 years from October 1978. Since his death on 2 April 2005, many thousands of people have been supporting the case for beatifying and canonising Pope John Paul II as a saint. His formal beatification ceremony took place on 1 May 2011.\n\nJohn Paul II's official title was \"Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of Saint Peter, Head of the College of Bishops, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Patriarch of the West, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City, Servus Servorum Dei, Pope John Paul II\". In 2006 the title \"Patriarch of the West\" was removed from the papal list of titles by the succeeding pope, Benedict XVI, due to its obsolescence.\n\nOn 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor. Normally five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Vicar Camillo Ruini, the one responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who dies within the diocese of Rome, cited \"exceptional circumstances\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived.\n\nThe \"exceptional circumstances\" may possibly refer to the people's cries of \"Santo Subito!\" (\"Saint now!\" in Italian) during the pontiff's funeral. Therefore, the new pope waived the five year rule \"so that the cause of Beatification and Canonisation of the same Servant of God can begin immediately\". The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St. Peter's Square. John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Camillo Ruini, vicar general for the diocese of Rome, officially opened the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005.\n\nIn early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible miracle associated with John Paul II. A French nun, confined to her bed by Parkinson's Disease or a neurological condition with similar symptoms which can go into remission, is reported to have experienced a \"complete and lasting cure after members of her community prayed for the intercession of Pope John Paul II\". The nun was later identified as Sister Marie Simon-Pierre.\n\nSister Marie Simon Pierre is a member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Maternity Wards from Puyricard, near Aix-en-Provence. Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, 46, is working again, now in Paris at a maternity hospital run by her order. She met reporters 30 March 2006 in Aix-en-Provence, during a press conference with Archbishop of Aix Claude Feidt.\n\n“I was sick and now I am cured,” she told reporters. “I am cured, but it is up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not.”\n\nIt has been suggested, however, that Sister Marie Simon-Pierre did not have Parkinson's Disease as there is no easy way to accurately diagnose the disease short of medical autopsy. Sister Marie Simon-Pierre also suffered a relapse though the Episcopal Conference of France disputed that the relapse (which would have thrown the purportedly miraculous nature of the cure into doubt) was anything more than a rumor.\n\nOn 28 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI said Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his homily he encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen \"in the near future\".\n\nIn January 2007, it was announced by Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz of Kraków, his former secretary, that the key interviewing phase in Italy and Poland of the beatification process was nearing completion. The relics of Pope John Paul II—pieces of white papal cassocks he used to wear—were being freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause to interested parties; this distribution and prayerful use of relics is a typical praiseworthy pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death.\n\nOn 8 March 2007 the Vicariate of Rome announced that the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007 – the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death – the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, who will conduct an investigation of their own.\nOn the fourth anniversary of Pope John Paul's death, 2 April 2009, Dziwisz told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica. A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gdańsk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents. On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, the boy told them, \"I want to walk\", and began walking normally.\n\nIn October 2009, Rome's mayor Gianni Alemanno said that the beatification, likely to draw huge crowds, was expected to take place in 2010, but on 4 November 2009 Monsignor Slawomir Oder, postulator of the cause of beatification, said that it was not yet known when study of the case could be concluded.\n\nOn 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that Pope John Paul II had lived a life of virtue. If Pope Benedict XVI agrees, he will sign the first of two decrees needed for beatification. The first recognises that he lived a heroic, virtuous life and enables him to be called \"Venerable\", the next step in the sainthood process. That decree was signed by Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday, 19 December 2009. The second vote and the second signed decree would recognise the authenticity of his first miracle (most likely, the case of Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, the French nun who was cured of Parkinson's Disease). Once the second decree is signed, the \"‘positio’\" (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and his writings and with information on the cause) is regarded as being complete. He can then be beatified. John Paul II was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on 1 May 2011.\n\nPrior to the announcement of the beatification, some ecclesiastical authorities had expressed concern that the cure of Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, and perhaps the cure of the boy who had cancer, may not be complete and lasting, as it has not been that long since the supposed miracles. Sister Marie's symptoms were analyzed very thoroughly before the beatification was announced (by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints and its medical panel for the Pope's case) to make sure they were not actually psychogenic, or related to another disease. The medical miracle was given a positive affirmation by the Congregation and its medical and theological panels, and by Pope Benedict. It would not have counted as a miracle if the cause was psychogenic and if the immediate physiological cure had not been judged to be definitive, total, and permanent, as well as directly attributable to his intercession.\n\nAnother reported miracle was that of Floribeth Mora Diaz. She was a Costa Rican lawyer who was cured of an incurable brain tumour. In this case neurosurgeon's were consulted by the authorities at the Vatican. Diaz was invited to the beatification ceremony.\n\nThe beatification ceremony of Pope John Paul II was held on 1 May 2011 and was presided over by Pope Benedict XVI. A vigil in preparation for the celebration was held the night before in the Circus Maximus. The casket in which he was interred was exhumed and placed before Saint Peter's tomb on 29 April 2011. It was placed in front of the main altar for public veneration during the ceremony. After the ceremony, the casket was reinterred in the Chapel of St Sebastian. A vial containing the Pope's blood, taken during the final days of his life, was displayed as a relic for veneration. The reliquary in which the vial was kept during the ceremony was carried by Sister Marie, and Sister Tobiann (who nursed the Pope during his illness).\n\nA total of 87 international delegations attended the ceremony, including 22 world leaders. Amid controversy, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe also attended the ceremony despite a European Union-wide travel ban imposed on him. He was able to travel freely into the Vatican via Rome due to a treaty that allows individuals wanting to travel to the Vatican to pass through Italy. His travel ban was waived by the EU.\n\nOne million Catholics gathered for the mass at Saint Peter's Square, where a giant portrait of the former Pope was set up. The Prefecture of the Papal Household, Bishop James Michael Harvey, has issued a draft program for the Beatification of John Paul II, describing it as \"a great ecclesial event,\" the office in charge of organising audiences and handles ticketing for all papal events at the Vatican, issued a statement that began “tickets are not needed to attend the beatification ceremony”.\n\nThe city of Rome plastered 30,000 posters around the city. A no-fly zone was enforced over Saint Peter's Square.\n\nOn 2 May 2011, following a two-day viewing by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, John Paul II's coffin was sealed within St Peters under the Altar of St. Sebastian.\n\nSome Catholics question the validity of the beatification. Calling into question both the validity of the purported miracle and also asking whether the purported miracle should be attributed to John Paul II rather than the prayers of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre to any other saint. There has been criticism of the rapidity of the beatification in light of the sexual abuse scandals. Much of the abuse, or its alleged cover-up, occurred while John Paul II was Pope, from 1979–2005, and the Church has been criticised for not doing enough to punish those found responsible.\nJohn Paul II has been criticised (more than perhaps any other issue) for not recognising the full severity of the sex abuse cases until they erupted in America in 2002. He has also been criticised for hindering the investigation into the charges of sexual immorality leveled against Father Marcial Maciel Degollado and for allowing diocesan bishops to transfer pedophile priests from one parish to another instead of reporting their crimes to the authorities. John Paul further stands accused of hindering Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who allegedly was attempting to prevent sex abuse.\n\nMeanwhile, Pope Benedict stands accused of deliberately hushing up the abundance of public and private affection displayed between John Paul II and Father Marciel. According to the \"National Catholic Reporter\", a recent leak of 212 Vatican documents shows a fuller story:\n\n\"Ratzinger wanted to elevate John Paul to beatification,\" said [José] Barba, coauthor of \"La Voluntad de No Saber\" (\"The Will Not to Know\"), an analysis of Vatican documents on Maciel [leaked in late 2011]. The book's publication last March [2012] and Benedict's refusal to meet with Maciel victims on a trip to Mexico [in the very same month] ignited an onslaught of bad press for the pope. Benedict had to reckon with the embarrassment of John Paul's praise of Maciel after the 1998 case, in essence scoffing at allegations against one of the most notorious sexual criminals in church history. By keeping a lid on Maciel's secret life, Barba said, Benedict hoped \"to defend the sainthood case against the accusations that John Paul protected predators.\"\n\nAfter the formal beatification ceremony on 1 May 2011, Pope Benedict could be more forthcoming in acknowledging the depth of Father Marciel's crimes. Meanwhile, Jason Berry has documented how the million dollar gifts of Father Marciel to John Paul II served to cement their friendship and to assure Marciel of papal immunity from prosecution.\n\n\nSince the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen throughout the world have been referring to the pontiff as \"John Paul the Great\"—only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed, and the first since the first millennium. Scholars of Canon Law say that there is no official process for declaring a pope \"Great\"; the title simply establishes itself through popular and continued usage. The three popes who today commonly are known as \"Great\" are: Leo I, who reigned from 440–461 and persuaded Attila the Hun to withdraw from Rome; Gregory I, 590–604, after whom the Gregorian Chant is named; and Pope Nicholas I, 858–867.\n\nHis successor, Pope Benedict XVI, referred to him as \"the great Pope John Paul II\" in his first address from the loggia of St Peter's Basilica, and he referred to Pope John Paul II as \"the Great\" in his published written homily for the Mass of Repose.\nSince giving his homily at the funeral of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI has continued to refer to John Paul II as \"the Great\". At the 2005 World Youth Day in Germany, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking in Polish, John Paul's native language, said, \"As the great Pope John Paul II would say: keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people.\" In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited John Paul's native Poland. During that visit he repeatedly made references to \"the great John Paul\" and \"my great predecessor\".\n\nIn addition to the Vatican calling him \"the great\", numerous books and newspapers have also done so. Journalist Peggy Noonan readily titled her book \"John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father\", and Catholic writer Randall Meissen subtitles his book about the pope's influence on Catholic culture, \"The Spiritual Sons of John Paul the Great.\" Also, the Italian newspaper \"Corriere della Sera\" called him \"the Greatest\" and the South African Catholic newspaper, The Southern Cross, has called him \"John Paul II The Great\".\n"}

Born in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana in 1880, he became partially blinded when he was seven. Very little is known about Gaspard and his life as a musician; even among big-time Cajun musicians and fans. A brilliant and dexterous guitarist, he is often regarded in Cajun and Americana music circles as a very mysterious and unacclaimed figure. His influences remain unknown, although his family is believed to have brought him into music. Gaspard suffered from deep depression and alcoholism throughout his life, and it is believed he remained a bachelor until his untimely death. Many of his rare recordings were re-released on Cajun compilations into the Millennium. He has since recently retained a small cult-following. Gaspard formed his first band with his brothers Victor and Amade. When he began recording in the late 1920s it was mainly as a backing guitarist for first-generation Irish American fiddler Delma Lachney. It was then that he also recorded some solo selections of his own during these sessions. Little else is known about Gaspard, though four of his sides (and a few of his appearances with Lachney) appear on the Yazoo compilation \"Early American Cajun Music\" released in 1999. None of Gaspard's original recordings are believed to have sold over 100 copies within his lifetime. Gaspard reportedly died untimely and alone in 1937. His sudden cause of death remains unknown. Gaspard is buried at Mater Dolorosa Catholic Cemetery, in Plaucheville, Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana.\n\nOne of Gaspard's select songs \"Sur Le Borde De L'eau\" was recently featured on the 2014 soundtrack of the HBO Television series True Detective, bringing Gaspard's musical endeavors into the mainstream public for the first time. Music journalist Amanda Petrusich discusses the song in her book about collecting 78 rpm records, \"Do Not Sell At Any Price\". The song was among those featured in a 2015 interview with Petrusich on the NPR program, \"Fresh Air\". Interest in Gaspard and his unsung music career have grown in significant popularity since the recent rediscovery of his music; as is featured on rare Cajun recordings re-released gradually into the Millennium.\n\n"}

His overall record was 230-8.\n\nHe went to Northern Michigan University as part of the United States Olympic Education Center. Viloria bested both Glenn Donaire in the quarter-finals, and future world champion Nonito Donaire in the semi-finals of the 2000 US Olympic Trials. He won a spot on the 2000 olympic team by defeating his one-time teammate, Karoz Norman.\n\nViloria went to the Sydney Olympics as a medal favorite, but lost to eventual gold medalist Brahim Asloum of France, 6-4.

Viloria secured four more victories before deciding to move back down to Light Flyweight.\n\nOn April 19, 2009, Viloria moved back down to junior flyweight to challenge Mexican Ulises \"Archie\" Solís for the IBF Junior Flyweight title. Pressured by a fading career due to his past losses in big fights, Viloria defeated Solis, whom at the time of the fight was rated the #1 Jr. Flyweight by The Ring in the 11th round with a vicious right to the jaw. The official bout stoppage was a KO 2:56 into the 11th round. The fight was held at Araneta Coliseum in the Philippines, site of the Thrilla in Manila, as the co-main event of the Donaire-Martinez fight.

{"id": "8680236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8680236", "title": "Chad Harris-Crane", "text": "Chad Harris-Crane\n\nChad Harris-Crane is a fictional character on the American soap opera \"Passions\", which aired on NBC from 1999 to 2007 and on DirecTV in 2007–08. Developed by the soap's creator and head writer James E. Reilly, Chad was portrayed by two actors over the course of the show: Donn Swaby (1999 to 2002) and Charles Divins (2002 to 2007). Swaby left the show to pursue roles outside daytime television and was replaced by Divins. The role was the first time that either actor had worked on a television series.\n\nChad is a member of the Crane family. The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch Alistair Crane, Chad is introduced as a music producer from Los Angeles who is searching for his biological family. Chad becomes involved in a love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone Russell. His romance with Whitney is complicated by the possibility they may be engaging in an incestuous relationship as Chad is initially believed to be her half-brother, and later revealed to be her adoptive cousin. Chad's later storylines focus on his confusion over his sexual identity, and his sexual relationship with tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before being killed by his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, Ethan Winthrop.\n\nCritical response to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized his relationship with Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; it was the first depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the exact nature of Chad's sexual orientation.\n\nSheraton Kalouria, senior vice president of NBC's daytime programming, described the show's use of color-blind casting as part of an effort to build a diverse pool of characters that best reflected the various ethnic and racial groups living in the United States. Kalouria believed the show was set apart from other soap operas by the inclusion of \"the African American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds\".\n\nThe role was played by two actors over the course of the show: Donn Swaby (1999 to 2002) and Charles Divins (2002 to 2007). \"Passions\" was Swaby's first role in a television series. On May 27, 2002, Swaby announced on his official website that he had decided to leave the show to pursue other opportunities outside of daytime television. Divins assumed the role on September 12, 2002. It was his first audition and acting experience; he had previously worked full-time as a fashion model and had decided to pursue an acting career after appearing in commercials. Divins initially auditioned for another soap opera, but its producers suggested that he instead take a role on \"Passions\". He described his time working on the show as a \"scholarship to acting\".\n\nChad was initially characterized as a \"street-kid\" by the show's official website and \"a tough dude from the hood\" by David Alexander Nahmod of the \"Bay Area Reporter\". Swaby called his character \"talented, ambitious, adventurous, passionate\", and said that his guarded personality was a way of \"defying the good guy, bad guy stereotype\". Chad originally served as the \"object of affection for both Simone and Whitney\", but his role on the series was expanded following the casting of Divins. An article on Soaps.com wrote that Divins adapted the character from being a \"West Coast music producer to [an] ambitious and tortured Crane heir\". Over the course of the show, Chad was defined by his relationships with his supposed half-sister Whitney and his nephew-niece, Vincent Clarkson. After Swaby left the show, he was disappointed by the direction Chad's storyline took.\n\nDespite the controversy and negative reception of Chad's sexual encounters with Vincent, Divins identified Chad's confusion over his sexual orientation as a vital part of the storyline. While the show was still filming, he expressed an interest in further exploring Chad's rejection of his sexuality. Divins felt that the key element of the storyline was Chad's difficulty in coming to terms with his sexuality. When asked by an interviewer about the revelation of Chad's sexuality, Divins said the show would include clear representations of \"male intimacy\". Divins said he was uncomfortable shooting scenes related to the storyline, but felt it was an opportunity to sharpen his skills as an actor. He added that he wanted to make the character as \"grounded and real as possible\" and keep the focus on how Chad reconciles with his sexual orientation.\n\nTo prepare for the storyline, Divins consulted with his gay friends and asked them how to ensure the character was \"being represented correctly and honestly\". Oprah Winfrey's discussion of the down-low on her talk show \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" also helped Divins better understand the character. Divins was unaware of the developments in Chad's sexuality until he was given the script four days prior to the filming of the episodes. He said he was surprised by the reveal that Chad's affair was with a man, but thought the soap opera's \"storytelling style lends itself to dramatic changes\". Divins praised the show for its inclusion of a black, gay character on daytime television regardless of any negative feedback from fans who preferred Chad and Whitney as a couple, and said that he wasn't afraid to take on the role, given the increased visibility of LGBT issues on television and in everyday society at the time of the storyline's broadcast. Chad's character and storyline were not to every cast member's taste; Tracey Ross, who played Eve Russell, later said she \"was never crazy about\" the incest plot, though Phillip Jeanmarie, who played Vincent Clarkson, commented that he was glad to have been part of the taboo-breaking story.\n\nChad Harris-Crane first appears in the episode airing on September 23, 1999, in which, after discovering he was adopted, he moves from Los Angeles to Harmony to find his real parents. Chad married Latoya Harris while he was working as a music producer in Los Angeles. Latoya refused to accompany Chad to Harmony as she did not want to leave her friends and family. While in Harmony, Chad encounters two people with information on his past - Orville Perkins and Crystal Harris. Orville, a senile old man, erroneously believes Chad is Eve's long-lost son with Crane Industries CEO Julian Crane and claims to have evidence proving this connection. In a desperate attempt to keep her past hidden, Eve burns down Orville's house and any evidence inside and places him in a retirement home. Chad later meets jazz singer Crystal Harris, who was Eve's confidante during her relationship with Julian and subsequent pregnancy. Crystal also offers information about Chad's birth and parents, but is killed by a French drug cartel's assassin Antoine, who mistakes her for socialite Sheridan Crane, before she can deliver it to him.\n\nDuring this time, Chad meets and falls in love with Whitney Russell. Their relationship is complicated by her sister Simone Russell's crush on him, and her parent's disapproval of him. Eve discourages both of her children from pursuing a relationship with Chad, fearing he will be a bad influence on her daughter in the same way Julian was on her teenage self. Whitney and Chad keep their romantic and sexual encounters secret for years while he pretends to be in love with Simone. The love triangle continues until Simone catches Whitney kissing Chad. Simone breaks up publicly with Chad and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with Whitney. During 2003, Chad's connection to Whitney steadily unravels after the discovery of his marriage to Latoya and her attempt to murder Whitney.\n\nIn 2004, Eve's vengeful adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne arranges for Eve's past relationship with Julian to be exposed to the Russell family and the rest of Harmony, resulting in Chad being erroneously identified as their son. From this point on, the apparently incestuous relationship between Chad and Whitney becomes one of the primary storylines on \"Passions.\" Whitney discovers that she is pregnant with Chad's child. She initiates a relationship with Fox Crane to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her child, from the stigma of incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's power of attorney to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to reconnect with Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician Miles Davis. During the show's 2005 summertime extravaganza, Whitney has sex with Chad in the middle of a tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the \"Vendetta\" plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on Alistair Crane luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by tabloid editor JT Cornell and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz. Following the revelation of his true paternity, Chad marries Whitney and they decide to raise their son together, and rename him Miles Harris-Crane.\n\nUnbeknownst to Whitney, Chad previously began a sexual relationship with the tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson at an unspecified time around the \"Vendetta\" plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is intersex, and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald and Noah Bennett, Chad repeatedly insists that he is not gay, and that his relationship with Vincent is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex in the back of a gay bar; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from Vincent. The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and Ethan Winthrop reunite, but that possibility is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.\n\nChad's possibly incestuous relationship led media outlets to sensationalize Harmony as the place where \"half-siblings sleep with one another\", and the 2006 revelation that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood was listed as one of \"Passions\" most shocking secrets by an article in \"Soap Opera Digest\". Soapdom.com asserted that the plot enabled Divins to showcase his acting abilities and distinguish himself from his predecessor Swaby.\n\nMedia outlets expressed differing opinions over the exact nature of Chad's sexuality. Hartinger called Chad a \"closeted bisexual\", and the \"Bay Area Reporter\" referred to him as a gay black man. An article on NewNowNext.com listed Divins' interpretation of the character as a choice for the \"Favorite Gay (Male) TV Character Poll\". Soap opera journalist Roger Newcomb of We Love Soaps questioned whether Chad was truly gay, arguing that Vincent's reveal as intersex leads to Chad's heterosexuality being \"rescued\" as he \"was sleeping only with Vincent's female anatomy\". Joel McHale from E!'s weekly television series \"The Soup\" turned a scene in which Chad insisted he was \"not gay\" despite his affair with Vincent into a running gag by referring to the character as \"Not Gay Chad\". During the show's season five premiere, Divins made a cameo appearance on \"The Soup\" to explain to McHale that he was not his character and was neither dead nor gay.\n\n\"Passions\" made daytime history by being the first to depict two men having sex, but the pairing of Chad and Vincent drew less media attention than the gay relationships in \"As the World Turns\" and \"One Life to Live\". The complicated incest storyline was described as \"insanely convoluted\" by Gawker's Kyle Buchanan, who felt it was one of \"the most insane things that have ever happened on television\"; the plotline was also praised, by Soaps.com, as reflecting the show's \"unique perspective and zest for controversy\" while challenging the \"often too safe and predictable world of soaps\". NewNowNext.com approved of the plotline for increasing the presence of LGBT people of color on daytime television, with Ross von Metze of Edge Media Network commenting that the show was \"taking risks where other TV shows have failed\".\n\nViewers were divided over the sexually explicit sequences between Chad and Vincent. Some felt the scenes between Chad and Vincent were \"appalling\" and inappropriate for daytime television, while one viewer praised the soap opera for \"continu[ing] their outstanding jobs as they teach the people of today's world about daily life experiences\". A writer from Soaps.com defended the show by pointing out graphic sex scenes between men and women were previously aired without complaint.\n\nChad's relationship with Vincent received some criticism, with \"Windy City Times\"; describing the storyline as \"reckless\" and \"outrageous\". According to \"Slate\"'s Ta-Nehisi Coates, the storyline was also disliked by the show's black audience. Mike Perigard of the \"Boston Herald\" was critical of the timing of the death of lesbian Rae Thomas following the reveal of Chad's affair with a man; Perigard argued that Thomas's character was removed to reduce the number of gay characters on the show.\n\n"}
{"id": "2496772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2496772", "title": "Charles-François Dupuis", "text": "Charles-François Dupuis\n\nCharles François Dupuis (26 October 174229 September 1809) was a French savant, a professor (from 1766) of rhetoric at the , Paris, who studied for the law in his spare time and was received as \"avocat\" in 1770. He also ventured into the field of mathematics and served on the committee that developed the French Republican Calendar.\n\nAlong with Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney (1757–1820) Dupuis was known for developing the Christ myth theory, which argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a mythical character.\n\nDupuis was born in Trie-Château (in present-day Oise), the son of a schoolmaster. His precocious talents were recognized by the duc de La Rochefoucauld who sent him to the College d'Harcourt. Dupuis made such rapid progress that, at the age of twenty-four, he was appointed professor of rhetoric at the college of Lisieux, where he had previously passed as a Licentiate of Theology. In his hours of leisure he studied law, and in 1770 he abandoned the clerical career and became an advocate. Two university discourses which he delivered in Latin were printed, and laid the foundation of his literary fame.\n\nIn 1778, he invented a telegraph with which he was able to correspond with his friend Fortin de Bagneux, and must be considered among the first inventors of the telegraph that was perfected by Claude Chappe. The Revolution made it necessary to destroy his machine in order to avoid suspicion.\n\nDupuis devoted himself to the study of astronomy (his tutor was Lalande) in connection with mythology, the result of which was his \"magnum opus\": \"Origine de tous les Cultes, ou la Réligion Universelle\". It appeared in 1795 in quarto or octavo format, profusely illustrated (in 12 volumes); an abridgement (1798) spread his system more widely among the reading public. In \"Origine\" he advocated the unity of the astronomical and religious myths of all nations, an aspect of the Enlightenment's confidence in the universality of human nature. In his \"Mémoire explicatif du Zodiaque, chronologique et mythologique\" (1806) he similarly maintains a common origin for the astronomical and religious opinions of the Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, Persians, and Arabians. His basis was what he saw as the perfect correspondence between the signs of the zodiac and their significations had existed in Upper Egypt at a period of between fifteen and sixteen thousand years before the present time, and that it had existed only there. Subsequently, this harmony had been disturbed by the effect of the precession of the equinoxes. He therefore ascribed the invention of the signs of the zodiac to the people who then inhabited Upper Egypt or Ethiopia. His theory as to the origin of mythology in Upper Egypt led to the expedition organized by Napoleon for the exploration of that country.\n\nHe then contributed to the \"Journal des savants\" a memoire on the origin of the constellations and on the explication of myth through astronomy, which was published as a separate fascicle in 1781. He came to the attention of Frederick the Great, who appointed him secretary but died before Dupuis could take up duties in Berlin. The chair of humanity in the Collège de France having at the same time become vacant, it was conferred on Dupuis, where he taught Latin eloquence, and in 1788 he became a member of the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres. He now resigned his professorship at Lisieux, and was appointed by the administrators of the department of Paris one of the four commissioners of public instruction.\n\nAfter the start of the French Revolution, Dupuis fled Paris for Évreux, appalled by the massacres of September 1792, only to return when he discovered he had been elected to the National Convention, where he sat on the Council of Five Hundred, and was President of the Legislative Body after the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire. He left political life in 1802. In April 1806 he received the Legion of Honor.\n\nDupuis believed in an impersonal God that permeated everything. Charles Bradlaugh has classified Dupuis as a pantheist.\n\nThe beginnings of the formal denial of the existence of Jesus can be traced to late 18th century France, and the works of Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney (1757–1820) and Dupuis. Volney and Dupuis argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a mythical character.\n\nDupuis argued that ancient rituals in Syria, Egypt and Persia had influenced the Christian story which was allegorized as the histories of solar deities, such as Sol Invictus. He argued also that Jewish and Christian scriptures could be interpreted according to the solar pattern, e.g. the Fall of Man in Genesis being an allegory of the hardship caused by winter, and the resurrection of Jesus an allegory for the growth of the sun's strength in the sign of Aries at the spring equinox.\n\nVolney argued that Abraham and Sarah were derived from Brahma and his wife Saraswati, and that Christ was related to Krishna. Volney published before Dupuis but made use of a draft version of Dupuis' work, and followed much of his argument, but at times differed from him, e.g. in arguing that the gospel stories were not intentionally created as an extended allegory grounded in solar myths, but were compiled organically when simple allegorical statements were misunderstood as history.\n\nFrench Catholic librarian Jean-Baptiste Pérès wrote a satirical refutation of Dupuis's work under the title of \"Grand Erratum\" (1827), in which he maintains, in parallel to Dupuis's thesis that the cult of Christ is merely a cult of the Sun, that Napoleon (who, in reality, died a mere six years before the publication of the pamphlet) never existed, but was only a sun myth.\n\n"}

Diggs was an early organizer of the Black Democratic Clubs in Detroit.\n\nDiggs was a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 3rd District from 1937-1944, and was a delegate from Michigan to the Democratic National Convention in 1940.\n\nDiggs gained a reputation as a friend of organized labor and a civil rights champion. Diggs had a personal story of traveling to Lansing in 1938 for his first session in the Legislature, and then being denied a room because of his race at the Olds Hotel across the street from the State Capitol. Diggs was forced to live during the week in one of Lansing's segregated neighborhoods. Diggs responded with a series of bills aimed at strengthening Michigan's civil rights laws, and the \"Diggs Law\" (Equal Accommodations Act of 1938—Act 117, signed by Governor Frank Murphy) made discriminatory service based on color, race or creed a misdemeanor.\n\nIn 1944, Diggs was defeated in the Democratic primary. Later, Diggs was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Representative from Michigan (1st District) as a Republican in the 1948 primary, and then as a Democrat in the 1952 primary.\n\nOn January 22, 1944, Diggs and 19 other current or former state legislators were charged with accepting bribes.

{"id": "2979275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2979275", "title": "Creolization", "text": "Creolization\n\nCreolization is the process in which creole cultures emerge in the New World. As a result of colonization there was a mixture among people of Indigenous American, West African and European descent, which came to be understood as Creolization. Creolization is traditionally used to refer to the Caribbean; although not exclusive to the Caribbean it can be further extended to represent other diasporas. The mixing of people brought a cultural mixing which ultimately led to the formation of new identities. Furthermore, creolization occurs when participants select cultural elements that may become part of or inherited culture. Robin Cohen states that creolization is a condition in which \"the formation of new identities and inherited culture evolve to become different from those they possessed in the original cultures,\" and then creatively merge these to create new varieties that supersede the prior forms.\n\nAccording to Charles Stewart, the concept of creolization originates during the 16th century, although there is no date recording the beginning of the word creolization. The term creolization was understood to be a distinction between those individuals born in the \"Old World\" versus the New World. As consequence to slavery and the different power relations between different races creolization became synonymous with Creole, often of which was used to distinguish the master and the slave. The word Creole was also used to distinguish those Afro-descendants who were born in the New World in comparison to African-born slaves. The word \"creolization\" has evolved and changed to have different meaning at different times in history.\n\nWhat has not changed through the course of time is the context in which Creole has been used. It has been associated with cultural mixtures of African, European, and indigenous (in addition to other lineages in different locations) ancestry (e.g. Caribbeans). Creole has pertained to \"African-diasporic geographical and historical specificity\". With globalization, creolization has undergone a \"remapping of worlds regions\", or as Orlando Patterson would explain, \"the creation of wholly new cultural forms in the transnational space, such as 'New Yorican' and Miami Spanish\". Today, creolization refers to this mixture of different people and different cultures that merge to become one.\n\nCreolization as a relational process can enable new forms of identity formation and processes of communal enrichment through pacific intermixtures and aggregations, but its uneven dynamics remain a factor to consider whether in the context of colonization or globalization. The meeting points of multiple diasporas and the crossing and intersection of diasporas are sites of new creolizations. New sites of creolizations continue the ongoing ethics of the sharing of the world that has now become a global discourse which is rooted in English and French Caribbean. The cultural fusion and hybridization of new diasporas surfaces and creates new forms of creolization.\n\nThere are different processes of creolization have shaped and reshaped the different forms of one culture. For example, food, music, and religion have been impacted by the creolization of today's world.\n\nCreolization has affected the elements and traditions of food. The blend of cooking that describes the mixture of African and French elements in the American South, particularly in Louisiana, and in the French Caribbean have been influenced by creolization. This mixture has led to the unique combination of cultures that led to cuisine of creolization, better known as \"creole cooking\". These very creations of difference flavors particularly pertains to specific territory which is influenced by different histories and experiences.\nJazz music took its roots from the dialogue between black folk music in the U.S., that is derived from plantations and rural areas and black music based in urban New Orleans. Jazz music developed from the \"creole music\" that takes its roots from the combination of blues, parlour music, opera, and spiritual music.\n\nThe popular religions of Haiti, Cuba, Trinidad, and Brazil formed from the mixing of African and European elements. Religious beliefs such as Voodoo in Haiti, Santeria in Cuba, Shango in Trinidad, and Candomblé in Brazil take its roots from creolization. The creation of these new religious expressions have sustained and evolved over time to make \"creole religions\".\n\n"}

{"id": "11675262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11675262", "title": "Emil Rieve", "text": "Emil Rieve\n\nEmil Rieve (June 8, 1892 – January 24, 1975) was an American labor leader. He was president of the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA) from 1939 to 1956, a vice president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) from 1939 to 1955, and a vice president of the AFL-CIO from 1955 to 1960.\n\nEmil Rieve was born in Poland and moved to Pennsylvania as a child. He left school early and first became a union member at age fifteen, quickly rising within the union hierarchy. He organized his first strike in 1930 in Reading, Pennsylvania. His aggressive drives to unionize the region's textile workers and achieve union recognition led to the Reading Formula of 1933 in negotiating with the National Labor Board, a precedent which resolved large numbers of other labor disputes. Rieve was a major figure in the unsuccessful textile workers strike of 1934. When the Congress of Industrial Organizations formed the following year, Rieve received international recognition for his efforts to avoid a rift with the American Federation of Labor.\n\nIn 1937 Rieve pioneered a successful sit-down strike of 50,000 textile workers that resulted in wage increases. He became acting chairman of the Textile Workers Organizing Committee in 1938 and organized the Textile Workers Union of America in 1939. The union was quite strong under Rieve's stewardship and he played a role in the merger of the AFL with the CIO in 1952.\n\nRieve was born in Żyrardów County in Congress Poland in 1892 to Fred and Pauline (née Lange) Rieve. The family was Lutheran, and Fred Rieve was a machinist who tended textile machines.\n\nRieve attended a local elementary school. But the family emigrated to the United States in 1904, interrupting Rieve's education. The Rieves settled in central Pennsylvania, and Emil found work in a hosiery mill. He married Laura Wosnack in July 1916. They had a son, Harold.\n\nIn 1907, at the age of 15, Rieve joined the American Federation of Hosiery Workers (AFHW), a semi-autonomous division of the United Textile Workers of America (UTW), an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor. His rise in the union was meteoric: At the age of 22, he was elected a vice president of the AFHW, became the division's president in 1929 at the age of 35, and joined the national UTW executive board in 1934.\n\nRieve was committed to organizing new members in the hosiery industry. In November 1930, Rieve authorized a strike among hosiery workers in the mills around Reading, Pennsylvania. The strike collapsed after heavy employer opposition. Rieve then tried a new tactic: The union agreed to a 30 percent wage cut in the expectation that non-union mills would lower their wages below the new union level. This would trigger a massive strike, enabling the AFHW to move in and organize the workers. Roughly 3,000 workers, or about a third of the total number in the industry, struck. Rieve purposefully withheld strike aid to the workers in an attempt to increase the radicalism of the workers and raise the demand for a union. But employers were content to idle plants in the depths of the Great Depression, and the strike lingered for nearly a year. Admitting defeat, Rieve signed a new contract in September 1932.\n\nJust three months later, Rieve led his division in approving yet another large organizing drive. Again aimed at workers in the Reading area, Rieve declared war \"against industrial slavery <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> starvation wages\". The organizing drive began in the summer of 1933. The employers refused to recognize the union, and 10,000 workers went on strike. On August 10, 1933, the National Labor Board mediated a settlement which established the \"Reading formula.\" The \"Reading formula\" was a major step forward in the conceptualization of American labor law, for it established the principle of secret-ballot elections as a means of determining union support among workers at a plant.\n\nBy 1934, despite Rieve's organizing drive and conditions favorable to union organizing created by the depression, the UTW still had only 80,000 paying members (making it one of the smaller unions in the AFL).\n\nThe National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 had authorized the establishment of \"industry codes\" to regulate wages, hours and working conditions in every industry in the United States. But employers not only heavily influenced the writing of the code, they also dominated the board adjudicating alleged violations of the code. The code led to few improvements in the textile industry. For example, when workers won shorter hours, employers made an end-run around the restriction by speeding up work.\n\nNewly elected to the UTW executive board, Rieve was one of several national union leaders who pressed for the union to threaten a nationwide strike in order to win improvements in the NIRA code. The strike was a mere threat, as UTW had no resources to undertake a nationwide strike. Nevertheless, the National Recovery Administration agreed to provide UTW leaders with a voice on the code adjudicatory board. UTW agreed to cancel the strike.\n\nLocal UTW leaders, however, refused to call off the strike. Locals in northern Alabama struck on July 18, and the strike swept through the Deep South. UTW was forced to call a special convention on August 13 to address the crisis. The UTW drew up a list of demands, which mill owners ignored. Nevertheless, the strike enjoyed initial success. In many counties, 80 percent of workers walked out. Nationwide, almost 400,000 textile workers left their jobs, an astonishing number in the middle of the depression.\n\nMill owners and state and local government officials worked together to put down the strike. State and local officials hired hundreds of \"special deputies\" to guard plants, prevent strikers from closing plants, protect replacement workers from harassment and intimidation, and (in some cases) to beat strikers and break up picket lines. The governors of Connecticut, Maine, North Carolina, Rhode Island and South Carolina ordered out the National Guard. The governors of Georgia and Rhode Island also declared martial law. In Georgia, the governor ordered the arrest of all picketers and held hundreds in a former World War I prisoner of war camp.\n\nViolence also broke out. Three picketers and mill guard were shot to death in Georgia. Six picketers were killed and more than 20 wounded in South Carolina. A picketer was murdered in Rhode Island when National Guardsmen fired into a crowd attempting to storm a rayon knitting mill.\n\nAfter a mere 22 days, the strike was over. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had established a mediation board in the first week of the strike. The board recommended further study, that workers return to work, and that employers rehire workers without discriminating against strikers. With the UTW able to provide staff, financial resources and strike benefits in only a few places and for a small number of workers, the strike collapsed. Employees attempted to return to work, but mill owners refused to rehire the strikers. Although the 1934 textile strike was a major defeat for Rieve and the UTW, the union did sign up thousands of new members and declared victory nonetheless.\n\nRieve was also active in politics. In 1932, he led a successful push to get the UTW to call for the establishment of a new political party beholden solely to the labor movement. A socialist, Rieve resigned his membership in the Socialist Party of America and supported the new American Labor Party.\n\nRieve also was a committed industrial unionist. The UTW itself was an amalgamated union, a form of industrial union. Rieve's experiences in attempting to organize new members had convinced him that industrial unionism was the key to building the labor movement. In 1934, Rieve convinced UTW delegates to approve a resolution supporting industrial unionism. This philosophical commitment would prove to be pivotal in Rieve's life.\n\nIn 1935, the American labor movement split over the question of craft versus industrial unionism. The Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) formed on November 9, 1935, and UTW president Thomas McMahon was one of the Committee's charter members.\n\nRieve and McMahon refused to surrender their principles. The two leaders secured passage in December 1935 of a UTW executive council resolution supporting the CIO. In July 1936, Rieve and McMahon gained additional support when the UTW convention approved the formation of the CIO and the UTW's membership in the organization. The AFL executive council \"tried\" the members of the CIO from July 8 to July 15, 1936, and expelled the UTW and the other CIO member unions on September 5.\n\nRieve, however, continued to hold out an olive branch to the AFL. In September 1936, he won AFHW support for a resolution asking the AFL to reconsider the expulsion of the CIO unions. Rieve was unable to organize many new members. Despite meetings with John Brophy, the CIO's organizing director, the CIO did not consider any major organizing effort in textiles. The UTW's finances were in such poor shape that the union actually cut the number of staff organizers by 20 percent. And despite conditions conducive to organizing, the union established only nine new locals between September 1936 and February 1937. Nevertheless, Rieve became known internationally for his efforts, and was appointed to the national committee of the International Labour Organization.\n\nFor most of the next three years, Rieve attempted to fend off a series of attacks on the division's collective bargaining agreements. About a third of the UTW's membership came from the hosiery division in early 1937, and Rieve was in many ways the UTW's true leader. In the spring of 1937, Rieve led 15,000 Pennsylvania hosiery workers out on strike for a new contract. Pioneering use of the sit-down strike, the strikers successfully closed the mills. The strike's success spread until more than 50,000 union workers were on strike. Rieve eventually signed an agreement giving workers wage increases of 8 to 10 percent.\n\nIn early 1938, however, Rieve was forced to act against his own union members. The recession of 1937 had led to a significant worsening of economic conditions. Union members in Philadelphia demanded a pay increase. Rieve argued that the union had only managed to stop a wage giveback; there was no possibility of securing a wage increase. Nevertheless, workers at more than 50 hosiery plants in the Philadelphia area struck on March 1, 1938. Rieve declared the strike to be \"illegal\" and actively supported employer and government efforts to end the job action. When the new union contract was signed in mid-July, Rieve and the AFHW had successfully resisted employer demands to cut wages but were forced to agree to a contract clause barring strikes and lockouts for the term of the three-year agreement. Rieve rose to national prominence through his astute leadership of the AFHW. After passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in June 1938, Rieve was appointed to a federal committee to determine minimum wages in the textile industry.\n\nIn February 1937, McMahon resigned the presidency of UTW to take a state government job in Rhode Island. He was succeeded by Francis J. Gorman. Meanwhile, the CIO had achieved sudden and large organizing victories in steel, automobile manufacturing and the rubber industry. The organizing victory in steel had come after the CIO had co-opted the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (the AA), using the long-established but moribund union as a means of legitimizing the CIO's efforts in organizing the steel industry. CIO leaders had forced the AA to become part of a new, centrally-run, and efficient organizing project, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC).\n\nCIO leaders had little confidence in Gorman or the UTW. Gorman had overseen the ill-fated 1934 textile strike. The UTW staff was considered incompetent, and politically behold to McMahon's relatively conservative policies. Rieve coveted the presidency of UTW, and worked to undercut Gorman at every turn—even when that meant disagreeing with actions he himself would otherwise support. Worst of all, UTW was practically bankrupt. Only the hosiery and dyers divisions were self-supporting, and Gorman was actually seeking a $5,000 loan from the CIO to keep the national union afloat.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, UTW was ill-equipped to organize in textiles. Although there were more than 1 million workers in the industry, \"textiles\" was actually more than 10 distinct industries. Each had its own markets, technology, and labor force. Workers rarely moved between segments of the industry, for their skills were not normally transferable. More than 6,000 textile firms existed, almost none of them strategic. The geographic spread of the industry encompassed 29 states, with nearly 75 percent of all textile employment in the virulently anti-union Deep South.\n\nBut Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and a CIO vice president, was adamant that the CIO undertake a comprehensive organizing drive in textiles. Now, two years after the victories in steel and automobiles, Hillman pressured CIO leaders to force the UTW into an agreement similar to that which had created SWOC. On May 9, 1937, the Textile Workers Organizing Committee (TWOC) was formed. Hillman was named the chairman, and Thomas Kennedy of the United Mine Workers its secretary-treasurer. The committee's other five members included Gorman and Rieve.\n\nTWOC organized impressive numbers of workers in its first six months. By September 1937, TWOC had organized 215,000 workers, most of them in the Northeast. But the recession of 1937 led to layoffs and sharp drops in TWOC membership. Additionally, Hillman fell critically ill in October 1937. He did not return to the committee's leadership until April 1938, and Rieve (not Thomas) was named the committee's acting chairman. Meanwhile, TWOC opened its organizing drive in the Deep South, but its efforts against the \"fortress of southern cotton\" proved fruitless. By the spring of 1939, after 18 months of work, TWOC could count only 27,000 Southern members—less than 7 percent of the region's textile workers.\n\nRieve's tenure as acting chairman saw the beginning of events which would seriously affect the union in the 1950s. The first was Rieve's ejection of the New Bedford Textile Council. The council, a federation of seven textile unions in New Bedford, Massachusetts, had been confronted by an employer demand in January 1938 to cut wages by 12.5 percent. Rather than stay silent and acquiesce in the wage cut, the council formally approved the wage reduction. The action not only angered other New England locals, but undercut TWOC organizing efforts in the region. Determined to uphold the authority of TWOC and concerned that the council's action might spark a revolt by other New England local unions, Rieve revoked the charters of the seven locals.\n\nIn late 1938, TWOC also saw a revolt from within. Hillman distrusted Gorman, and clearly favored Rieve as the leader of the union which would emerge once TWOC's organizing drives concluded. Gorman and other disgruntled UTW leaders filed suit against TWOC, claiming that UTW funds had been illegally appropriated by TWOC. A Rhode Island superior court ruled on November 30, 1938, that the TWOC-UTW agreement of March 9 was invalid. Gorman then denounced TWOC and Hillman, and sought to re-affiliate UTW with the AFL. On December 28, 1938, Gorman led a convention of 21 delegates in voting for affiliation with the AFL. The AFL executive council approve the affiliation on February 3, 1939.\n\nHillman and the TWOC leadership branded Gorman a traitor and replaced him with George Baldanzi, president of the UTW's dyers division.\n\nRealizing that the March 9 agreement might not survive court scrutiny, Hillman, Rieve and Baldanzi called a convention of UTW and TWOC locals for May 15, 1939. The convention voted to merge the two organizations into a new union, the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA). Rieve was elected president, and Baldanzi vice president. Both elections were unanimous.\n\nEmil Rieve's tenure as president of the TWUA saw the union's prestige and importance soar during World War II and falter in the 1950s. The union's decline in the 1960s finally led Rieve to retire. Rieve was elected a vice president of the CIO in 1939 after his election as TWUA president.\n\nIn 1940, Rieve established a Southern organizing committee and pushed the union deeper into politics. With himself as the head of the organizing project, the union organized Marshall Field's, Lane Cotton and the Erwin Cotton Mills—the latter the first of the \"big four\" North Carolina cotton mills to be organized. Rieve also kept the union politically active, making the TWUA one of the first labor organizations to endorse Franklin D. Roosevelt for president for reelection in 1940.\n\nBut in May 1941, the New Bedford Textile Council affiliated with the AFL's UTW, providing the rump union with a significant boost. Soon the UTW had defeated the TWUA in elections in Massachusetts and Tennessee, and was beginning to challenge the TWUA in the Northeast.\n\nIn March 1941, President Roosevelt created the National Defense Mediation Board, and appointed Rieve as an alternative labor representative. The board had been created to help resolve collective bargaining disputes in defense production, transportation and raw materials industries. The United Mine Workers were fighting for the closed shop when the board's public and employer representatives voted that the issue should be submitted to binding arbitration. Angry that the board would not order the mine owners to submit to the closed shop, Rieve and the other CIO members of the board resigned. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, however, the president established the War Labor Board on January 12, 1942, to arbitrate labor disputes and wage settlements. Rieve was appointed as an alternate to the board and served throughout the war. But Rieve and other labor representatives left the body in early 1945 after the public and employer members of the board refused to approve sizeable post-war wage increases for union members. Rieve released the TWUA from its wartime no-strike pledge shortly thereafter.\n\nAlthough Rieve had purged his union of communists in the mid-1930s, he found himself accused of communist dictatorship in 1944. American Labor Party (ALP) leader Sidney Hillman felt that the 1944 presidential election would be a close one in New York state. Hillman proposed that communists be permitted to play a role in the party, hoping to tip the state toward Roosevelt. ALP leader David Dubinsky felt the communists should be expelled from the ALP. Rieve supported Hillman. Rieve was labeled a communist, and Samuel Baron (the general manager of the TWUA) resigned in protest from the union. Nevertheless, Hillman's proposal won the approval of ALP delegates, and Roosevelt easily carried New York in the general election.\n\nIn 1945, Rieve was a member of a CIO delegation to the Soviet Union. He was an ardent anti-communist, however, and strongly criticized the Soviet Union afterward. Two years later, Rieve became one of the first CIO leaders to sign the non-communist oath required by the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\nIn 1948, Rieve expelled his old division, the American Federation of Hosiery Workers, from the TWUA. The division, which had 20,000 members, was a major backer of TWUA executive vice-president George Baldanzi. Baldanzi was strongly critical of Rieve's leadership of the union, and argued that Rieve was not doing enough to organize new members or win contract improvements. When the Hosiery Workers withheld dues in protest of the Rieve administration's policies, Rieve pulled the division's charter.\n\nThe tension between Rieve and Baldanzi worsened over the next two years. In May 1950, Rieve attempted to unseat Baldanzi as executive vice-president. Baldanzi, however, beat back the attempt and retained his seat. Rieve then tried to amend the TWUA constitution to remove the executive vice-president from the line of succession if the president should fall ill or die. This attempt, too, was defeated.\n\nRieve fired Samuel Baron, a Baldanzi supporter and the regional director of the TWUA in Canada, in March 1951. Baron retained his elected position as a TWUA vice president, however. For the next four months, the TWUA was roiled by the firing, with the Baldanzi faction attempting to overturn Baron's dismissal and drive Rieve from office. In early June, the TWUA executive council upheld Rieve's action, albeit by a slim majority. Six weeks later, the Baldanzi faction announced a \"democracy movement\" within the TWUA and submitted a full slate of candidates to challenge Rieve for leadership of the union.\n\nIn August 1951, the AFHWA re-affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. On April 30, 1952, TWUA delegates re-elected Rieve as president of the union. The vote was 1,223 to 720, although most observers claimed this was a startlingly close election given Rieve's near-total control over the union. The convention was a contentious one. Delegates engaged in heated debate, with many exchanges devolving into shouting matches. Rieve was forced to alter a number of his policy decisions in order to win delegate support. On the last day of the convention, Rieve fulfilled one such pledge by announcing that he was resigning from the Wage Stabilization Board in the midst of a major dispute over steelworker wages in order to devote more time to union business and less to government and other duties.\n\nBaldanzi, no longer an office-holder in the TWUA, announced he had been hired as an organizer with the American Federation of Labor and would be working with the TWUA's arch-rival, the United Textile Workers. He called for disaffected TWUA locals to follow him into the AFL. A number of local TWUA union presidents and leaders followed him into the UTW as organizers.\n\nOver the next several months, nearly 40 TWUA locals representing 20,000 members—about 2 percent of the union's membership—attempted to disaffiliate from the national union and join the AFL. The secession movement was a national one, involving locals in Canada, Maine, the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states. Rieve accused Baldanzi and the dissident locals of dual unionism. Rieve induced CIO president Philip Murray to threaten wholesale raiding of AFL unions if the UTW accepted the breakaway locals into that union. Rieve suspended local officials, trusteed local unions, impounded local union funds and padlocked local union offices, and sent national staff into wavering locals to shore up support for the TWUA. By August, more than 50,000 TWUA members had left the union for the UTW. But Rieve's actions blunted the secession movement. High-level talks between AFL and CIO leaders eventually put a stop to the raids.\n\nThe crisis severely weakened Rieve's political position within the union, and led to collective bargaining difficulties. Membership losses were particularly high in the South and Canada. Although most of Rieve's political opponents had left the TWUA for the UTW, the secession movement led many of the remaining members to question Rieve's leadership of the union. The union's finances were significant affected by the disaffiliations, forcing members to raise dues to cover a budget shortfall. Rieve claimed that only 12,500 members had disaffiliated, but admitted that the union's membership had fallen by 400,000 as it defended itself from raids rather than organized new members.\n\nThe secession movement in the TWUA in 1952 aided in the merger between the AFL and CIO in 1955. Both Philip Murray and William Green had died in November 1952. The sudden outbreak of raiding deeply alarmed their successors, Walter Reuther and George Meany. The dissension within the TWUA led to a series of \"no-raid\" pacts between the AFL and CIO, agreements which helped pave the way for eventual merger of the two labor federations. Rieve played an important role in the AFL-CIO merger talks, pushing for merger as a solution to raiding and serving on various merger committees.\n\nAfter the merger of the AFL and CIO, Rieve was elected a vice president of the merged labor federation. As Rieve's position within the TWUA deteriorated, however, he became nationally-known for a pushing a variety of causes. He stridently attacked the Taft-Hartley Act, and declared that the law had permitted Southern textile executives to engage in a \"widespread conspiracy\" to destroy the union's Southern locals. He was a vocal and extremely critical opponent of President Dwight Eisenhower, and acted as the AFL-CIO's point man against the president while Meany and other leaders muted their criticism. Despite public disavowals of his extreme attacks on the administration, AFL-CIO leaders privately supported his actions and in 1955 he was named to an AFL-CIO committee on economic policy.\n\nRieve continued to play a role in international affairs as well. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the U.S. for 13 days in September 1959, Rieve was a member of an AFL-CIO delegation which met with Khrushchev for three and a half hours in a closed-door session. He excoriated Soviet labor union officials for being puppets of the Communist regime and attacked Khrushchev as a dictator and war-monger.\n\nFaced with rapidly declining membership, the 63-year-old Rieve retired as TWUA president at the union's ninth biennial convention in 1956. However, he continued to serve on the union's executive board as chairman until 1960. He was named \"president emeritus\" and given a lifetime annuity of $15,000 a year.\n\nRieve was forced to retire from the TWUA executive board in 1964. During a speech at the union's biennial convention, Rieve blasted the union's leadership for allowing the membership to fall to a mere 127,000 and for failing to organize non-union plants. Rieve retired as a vice president of the AFL-CIO after losing his TWUA office. Although Rieve had pushed for his successor, William Pollock, to be elected to the AFL-CIO executive council, Reuther supported Ralph Helstein, the president of the United Packinghouse, Food and Allied Workers.\n\nAfter his forced retirement, Rieve retired to Florida, where he lived quietly. Emil Rieve died of heart failure at his home in Lauderhill, Florida, on January 24, 1975.\n\n"}

They are the German twin children of supervillain Baron Strucker of HYDRA and the half-siblings of Werner von Strucker. \n\nAndrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker appear in the television series \"The Gifted\", portrayed by Caitlin Mehner and Paul Cooper respectively.\n\nCreated by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr., the von Strucker twins first appeared in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #194 (June 1985) in their civilian identity and in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #200 (December 1985) as Fenris.\n\nAndrea and Andreas are the children of the terrorist organization HYDRA leader Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. While the two were still in their mother's uterus, they were genetically modified which gave them bio-energy powers which they can use when in physical contact with one another (usually when holding hands). Strucker indoctrinated his children in the beliefs of white supremacy, Nazism and the Fourth Reich. In adulthood, the twins became the supervillains known as \"Fenris\" and led the Fenris terrorist organization.\n\nLike their father, they are white supremacists. The Strucker twins have gone up against Storm when Storm interrupts Andreas' attempted assault on a native woman in Africa. Andrea retaliates for Storm's humiliation of her brother by shooting her in the head and leaving her to die. The Strucker twins despise Magneto for the role in their father's seeming death some years after World War II. They conduct acts of terrorism and finally attack Magneto during the trial in Paris by the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity. The X-Men foil their assassination attempt, but Fenris manages to escape by allowing themselves to be swept into the old city sewers. The twins later resurface as part of a group of mutant millionaires who engage in a campaign of murder as part of a game organized by the mutant telepath Gamesmaster and the Hellfire Club's former Black Queen Selene. The twins tried to acquire Omega Red for the Upstarts but failed. The twins ultimately met their match, though, when they tried to kill the former New Mutant Wolfsbane. Wolfsbane and the X-Factor team easily beat the twins.\n\nThe twins joined a conference of powerful criminal leaders who intended to divide up what's left by the fallen Kingpin's empire. Among the members of the conference were Slug, Hammerhead, Tombstone and Werner von Strucker. The twins did not believe Werner was actually their sibling. This, and other arguments, caused the conference to degenerate into a shouting, shooting and blasting match. Fenris attempted to kill Hammerhead but was rescued. Their sibling is soon after killed by their father attending the conference disguised as Werner's assistant. The twins resurfaced, where they were seen working with Baron Strucker. They fight Citizen V (John Watkins III), however, Andrea discovers that Citizen V is actually Helmut Zemo's mind transferred into the real Citizen V's body by Techno after being decapitated by Nomad under Henry Peter Gyrich's orders. Zemo quickly kills Andrea to keep her from telling anyone the truth.\nAfter Andrea's death, Zemo has the Purple Man brainwash Andreas into taking the \"Swordsman\" alias. Purple Man has him flay the skin from Andrea's corpse to incorporate the resulting leather into his sword's hilt, allowing him to channel their shared powers through his sword. Andreas breaks free of Purple Man's control and joins the Thunderbolts. Andreas continues to be a member under the Thunderbolts' new leadership. Teammate and current field leader Moonstone has approached Andreas with a reassurance. If he helps kill Songbird, Moonstone would be able to make a move to usurp the mentally fragile Norman Osborn as the Thunderbolts' director. Thus two factions seem to be forming amongst the Thunderbolts with Andreas and Moonstone on one side while Songbird and Radioactive Man stand on the other. Despite his considerable skill, he has been defeated twice; the first is when Jack Flag hit him with the flat of his own sword, and the second is when Steel Spider threw him through a window and a flat-screen television using a metal limb.\n\nUnder the control of four imprisoned telepaths, Swordsman has taken over the \"Baron Strucker\" title and shaved his head in his father's honor. He has gained the loyalty of several guards by paying them well, and ordered them to set off a bomb in the \"Zeus\" (the Thunderbolts' carrier) to initiate a lockdown. He declares to one of his guards that Norman will bring him back his sister or everyone in Thunderbolts Mountain will be killed. After a detachment of guards kill most of his loyal guards, Strucker kills off the remaining attacking guards. He then encounters Venom declaring to eat Strucker. The two fight, and Strucker runs Venom through with his sword, activating his energy powers while the sword is in Venom's body. Soon afterwards, Osborn snaps from the pressures of running the Thunderbolts, and the Green Goblin brutally attacks Andreas, crucifying him to a wall with small goblin-daggers.\n\nNot long afterward, it is discovered that Andreas used Arnim Zola to make a clone of Andrea von Strucker. Although Andreas has his sister back, he decides to complete his Thunderbolts contract, leaving the group as a free man. In order to protect Andrea's clone while on missions, Andreas skins his arm, giving the flesh to his sister's clone to hold, allowing her to use their shared powers. Andrea's clone accompanies Andreas and the Thunderbolts during the battle against the Skrulls, and witnesses as Moonstone incapacitates Andreas and attempts to make a deal with the Skrulls. Andrea's clone then attacks Moonstone. While she is preoccupied with Moonstone, Bullseye kills her from behind. Osborn later convinces Andreas that the Skrulls killed his sister. Andreas also saves Songbird when Bullseye attempts to kill her. Andreas later confronts Osborn with the revelation that he was not being offered a slot on Osborn's personal Avengers as well as never planning on fulfilling the vow to resurrect his sister or to give him a full Presidential pardon after his contract ended. During the confrontation, his momentarily insane employer stabs Andreas through the chest, apparently killing him with his own sword, and throwing him out over the mountain.\n\nAndrea and Andreas returned to the living and have opened Club Fenris, a supervillain club in Manhattan. When questioned about their demise and subsequent return from the dead, they stated that their father \"took care of it\".\n\nAs a result of genetic engineering with their X-Genes when they were still in utero, Fenris were able to fly and generate energy blasts, but only when they were holding hands. When holding hands, Andreas could generate concussive force blasts while Andrea could generate disintegration beams. Swordsman uses various hidden blades; his primary sword blade is sheathed in an adamantium alloy and can shoot a grappling hook-like projectile. His sword's hilt is wrapped with Andrea's skin to release powerful bioelectric blasts of concussive force.\n\nAndrea and Andreas were seen assisting their father in a resistance against both mutants and Kree. Both of them end up killed in action.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Andrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker are androgynous mutant twins that can generate heat blasts when they touch each other that seek mutant supremacy through economic control as German business tycoons. Co-Presidents of the global investment firm Fenris International, they're deeply involved in corporate crime to \"end the economic domination of Homo sapiens\" while masquerading as an honorable investment banking firm with offices in the Empire State Building. It is also shown that they are lovers. They have dealings with Black Tom Cassidy, and have tried to recruit Gambit and Rogue; Rogue rejected the offer and Gambit was already in their employ but rebelled to help Rogue escape. It is revealed that the Fenris twins are behind the recent Sentinel attacks with the creator of the first wave of mutant hunting robots. It has also been revealed that they are tied to the Mutant Liberation Front. As a result of their activities involving the Sentinels and the Mutant Liberation Front, Bishop apparently killed the twins during their battle with Bishop's X-Men team.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The invasion was a success, although the extent to which this can be attributed to the ruse is unknown.\n\nMichael was born in Aberbargoed in Monmouthshire in south Wales. Before leaving the town, he held part-time jobs as a gardener and labourer. His father Thomas, a coal miner, killed himself when Michael was 15 and his mother died when he was 31. Michael, homeless, friendless, depressed and with no money, drifted to London where he lived on the streets. \n\nHe was found in an abandoned warehouse close to King's Cross, seriously ill from ingesting rat poison that contained phosphorus. Two days later, he died at age 34 in St. Pancras Hospital. His death may have been suicide, although he may have simply been hungry, as the poison he ingested was a paste smeared on bread crusts to attract rats.\n\nAfter being ingested, phosphide reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach, generating phosphine, a highly toxic gas. Bentley Purchase, coroner of St. Pancras District, explained, \"This dose was not sufficient to kill him outright, and its only effect was so to impair the functioning of the liver that he died a little time afterwards\". When Purchase obtained Glyndwr's body, it was identified as being in suitable condition for a man who would appear to have floated ashore several days after having died at sea by hypothermia and drowning.\n\nBefore Michael, finding a usable cadaver had been difficult, as indiscreet inquiries would cause talk, and it was impossible to tell a dead man's next of kin what the body was wanted for. The dead man's parents had died and no known relatives were found. The body was released on the condition that the man's real identity would never be revealed. Ewen Montagu later claimed the man died from pneumonia, and that the family had been contacted and permission obtained, but neither of those things was true.\n\nOn 30 April, Lt. Norman Jewell, captain of the submarine \"Seraph\", read the 39th Psalm, and Michael's body was gently pushed into the sea where the tide would bring it ashore off Huelva on the Spanish Atlantic coast.\nAttached to Michael's body was a briefcase containing secret documents that had been fabricated by the British intelligence service. The purpose was to make German intelligence (which was known to have operatives in Huelva) think Michael had been a courier delivering documents to a British general. The documents were crafted to deceive the Germans into thinking that the British were preparing to invade Greece and Sardinia, rather than Sicily, and they succeeded in doing so.\n\nMichael's body was picked up by a fisherman and he was buried as Major William Martin with full military honours. His grave lies in Huelva's cemetery of Nuestra Señora, in the San Marco section. The headstone reads:\n\nWilliam Martin, born 29 March 1907, died 24 April 1943, beloved son of John Glyndwyr Martin and the late Antonia Martin of Cardiff, Wales, Dulce et Decorum est pro Patria Mori, R.I.P.\"\n\nThe Latin phrase translates as \"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country.\" In 1998, however, the British Government revealed the body's true identity. To the gravestone was added:\n\nGlyndwr Michael; Served as Major William Martin, RM\n\nA plaque commemorating Glyndwr Michael is now also on the war memorial in Aberbargoed. It is headed \"Y Dyn Na Fu Erioed\" (translation – \"The Man Who Never Was\").\n\n"}

Graham is a public advocate for Children International, and supported the climate change campaign Global Cool in 2007.\n\nGraham was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at St. Michaels Hospital, the older of two children. Her family is of \"three-quarters Irish\" descent, with her father's side from County Cork. Her younger sister, Aimee Graham, is also an actress, and writer. Their mother, Joan (née Bransfield), is a teacher and author of children's books. Their father, James Graham, is a retired FBI agent. The girls were raised Catholic. Her family relocated repeatedly before moving to Agoura Hills, California, when she was 9. She was introduced to acting during a school production of \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nAfter high school, Graham enrolled in extension classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied English for two years. Despite her parents' objections, Graham withdrew from UCLA to pursue acting full-time.\n\nGraham's first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in \"Mrs. Soffel\" (1984). Her first credited film appearance was in the television film \"Student Exchange\". In 1986, she appeared on a special \"Teen Week\" episode of the NBC game show \"Scrabble\".

Her first high-profile starring role came in the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle \"License to Drive\" (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim's character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the \"Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy\" category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy \"Heathers\" (1988), which had an expletive-rich script. The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger's mother in \"Twins\" (during the laboratory conception flashback).\n\nIn 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant's \"Drugstore Cowboy\" as Nadine, a young drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive. After \"Drugstore Cowboy\" she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's dark comedy \"I Love You to Death\" (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film \"Shout\" (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.\n\nAfter co-starring with Benicio del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in \"Twin Peaks\", where she appeared in the final six episodes.

She had a small but important role in \"Swingers\" (1996), where she played Lorraine, Jon Favreau's love interest. She also played a small role as Maggie Bowen in \"\" (1996).\n\nGraham's popularity significantly increased after she appeared as Brandi, a young porn star, nicknamed Rollergirl, in Paul Thomas Anderson's critically acclaimed, award-winning \"Boogie Nights\" (1997). The cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The same year she also starred in the Gregg Araki film Nowhere, and had a cameo in the horror hit \"Scream 2\". She was subsequently cast in \"Two Girls and a Guy\" (1998), a film mainly based upon dialogue between the characters which was shot in 11 days, which co-starred Robert Downey Jr. and Natasha Gregson; and the sci-fi film \"Lost in Space\", which was met with mostly negative reviews, and grossed $69,117,629 domestically on a production budget of $80 million. The cast was signed on for sequels that remain unmade.\n\nShe starred as Felicity Shagwell in the sequel \"\" (1999), which was a box-office hit.

She played Joline, a devoted-beyond-reason young wife looking for the husband who left her. While the film itself received mixed-to-negative reviews, critics felt that \"Graham shows she can play a central character\" but noted \"she's not enough to make \"Committed\" successful\". The following year she co-starred as Annie Matthews, an unhappily married woman, in Edward Burns' \"Sidewalks of New York\". In 2003, she starred with Joseph Fiennes in Chen Kaige's English-language debut film \"Killing Me Softly\", which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being: \"Respected director Chen Kaige's first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue\". In 2009, the site also rated it No. 12 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.\n\nGraham's other appearances in mainstream fare include playing a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper murder victim Mary Kelly in the film \"From Hell\" (2001), starring Johnny Depp; \"Anger Management\" (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson; the Farrelly Brothers comedy \"Say It Isn't So\" (2001), opposite Sally Field; \"The Guru\", co-starring Jimi Mistry and \"Hope Springs\" (2003), co-starring Colin Firth.\n\nDuring this period, Graham starred in the independent films \"Gray Matters\", \"Broken\", \"Adrift in Manhattan\" (all 2007) and \"Miss Conception\" (2008), which received negative-to-mixed reviews and most of them went largely unnoticed at the box-office.

In 2006, she co-starred in \"Bobby\" as Angela; the film's cast was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\nDuring this period Graham also spoke about developing a comedy film titled \"The Accidental Virgin\" which would have focused on \"female sexual confusion\", telling the story of a woman who hasn't had sex in a year. The film has not been made. She also stated she would be interested in directing in the future if there is \"something that, its burning in my mind that I need to do\".\n\nOn television, Graham played herself in an episode of the TV series \"Sex and the City\".

In 2010, she starred in \"Boogie Woogie\", followed by roles in the unsuccessful films \"Father of Invention\", \"5 Days of War\", \"Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer\" (all 2011) and \"About Cherry\" (2012).\n\nGraham voiced the character of Antonia Bayle in the online role-playing game \"EverQuest 2\".\n\nShe played Meredith Crown in \"At Any Price\", which stars Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron and was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and later screened as an official selection at the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals. Upcoming roles include mob lawyer Annette Stratton-Osborne in \"Behaving Badly\" and short story writer Mary Bellanova in \"My Dead Boyfriend\" (both 2014). She wrote a comedy screenplay called \"Half Magic\", which she stated she wants to direct. She said the story focuses on \"these female friends and sexuality and about people having a sense of shame about sexuality and learning how to have a healthier attitude about it [...] It also deals with male/female relationships and sexism\".\n\nIn 2012, she was a member of the jury of the 15th Shanghai International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2014, she starred in the second adaptation of the V. C. Andrews novel \"Flowers in the Attic\" on the Lifetime network. She played the character of Corrine Dollanganger; an evil mother who locks her four children in an attic in order to receive an inheritance from her dying father. Graham also appeared in two TV-movie sequels based on the V.C. Andrews' series: \"Petals on the Wind\" and \"If There Be Thorns\"; continuing to play the role of Corrine Dollanganger. She appeared in the final season of \"Californication\" as the mother of David Duchovny's long-lost son.\n\nBesides her acting work, Graham is also an activist who serves as a public advocate for Children International. She stated that what she likes about Children International is that \"you are helping a child have a better life. It's great for that child to know that someone who lives in another country cares about them\". Graham works with the Cambodian Children's Fund which provides supplies and education, and campaigns to stop slavery. \"There's a lot of human trafficking in Cambodia,\" Graham has said. \"Women are dying because they don't have $15 to give birth in a hospital. The [Children's Fund] provides free education, clean water and healthcare for communities... We're creating future leaders who will be able to help themselves.\" In 2007 she supported the climate change campaign Global Cool and appeared in Shekhar Kapur's short film \"Global Cool\" alongside Sienna Miller.\n\nGraham is considered a sex symbol. She was ranked at number 40 in \"FHM\"'s \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" list in 2000, number 95 in 2001 list, number 97 in the 2002 list, number #74 in the 2005 list and at number #98 in 2006 list. In 2001 she was named one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People\" by \"People\". In 2003, she also posed for a photoshoot by photographer Sam Jones, during which she was levitated several feet into the air by a magician, who later also sawed her in half. Also in 2003, Graham appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine for an article titled \"The Science of Meditation\". To promote \"Emily's Reasons Why Not\", she had posed for a \"Life Magazine\" cover story, printed weeks in advance of the assumed series schedule, referring to her as \"TV's sexiest star\" which appeared in the January 27, 2006 issue.\n\nGraham is often cast in sexual roles including those of Felicity Shagwell (\"Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me\"), porn stars Rollergirl (\"Boogie Nights\") and Sharonna (\"The Guru\"), prostitute Mary Kelly (\"From Hell\"), porn director Margaret (\"About Cherry\") and stripper Jade (\"The Hangover\" and \"The Hangover, Part III\"). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that \"our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be 'good' mothers who would never do those things?\" and that she likes \"the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex\".\n\nIn 2005, Graham became the spokeswoman and TV model for the Garnier brand of hair care products.\n\nGraham has been estranged from her parents in the past, supposedly due to their strict Irish Catholic beliefs and her rebellion as a teenager. Regarding the media's perception of her relationship with her parents, she stated: \"I don't really like to talk about my parents. Because I just feel that it gets misinterpreted in the press...\"\n\nShe has been practicing transcendental meditation since 1991 after being introduced to it by David Lynch. She also expressed her dislike of reality television, stating in a 2007 interview: \"I think some of it, it seems strange – why do we all want to watch people be so miserable? Other people’s pain and misery – it seems kind of sad.\"\n\n"}

She grew up in a large family having had three brothers and four sisters. After graduating from Isle Madame District High School in 1987, Boudreau attended Dalhousie University where she earned a degree in biology and began working as a Park Interpreter for the Canadian Parks Service. Afterwards she began training as a Registered Respiratory Therapist at the Victoria General School of Allied Health. It wasn't until she was in her late twenties when she moved to Ontario from her Maritime hometown in order to begin her career as a children's author.\n\nWhen asked what inspired Boudreau to become a children’s author, she recalled:\n\nIn 2007, Boudreau was short-listed in the Surrey International Writing Contest, in the \"Writing For Young People\" category for \"With Measured Breath: A YA short story\". Shortly afterwards, Boudreau began working on her first book called \"Acadian Star\" after many years of having settled in Ontario. The novel was aimed at middle school children and tells the adventures of a young girl named Meg Gallant who takes part in a home town competition with her friend Neve, called the Acadian Star. It was published in 2008, by Nimbus Publishing and was soon nominated for the 2009/2010 \"Hackmatack Children’s Choice Award\". \"Acadian Star\" also took 2nd place in the 2008 \"Writers Federation of New Brunswick Literary Competition\", at which time Boudreau began accumulating a local fan base among younger readers in Eastern Canada.\n\nThe year 2010 saw the publishing of two more novels of Boudreau's titled \"KEEP OUT!\", by \"Nimbus Publishing\" and \"Real Mermaids Don't Wear Toe Rings\", by \"Jabberwocky Publishing\" about \"an aquaphobic mer-girl trying to balance the drama of two-legged teenage life with her quest to rescue her mermaid mother from really scary mer-dudes\". The second was to become her best known book, a Crystal Kite Member Choice Finalist, and served as a prequel to \"Real Mermaids Don't Hold Their Breath\" (May, 2012) and \"Real Mermaids Don't Have Two Left Feet\" (February 2013). Ironically, Boudreau wrote most of her first novel in the \"Real Mermaids series\", Real Mermaids Don't Wear Toe Rings, on her feet. An avid walker, she stated \"I find when you're on the move, it helps your thoughts be on the move, too.\"\n\nBoudreau married Gordon Clarke, a now retired lieutenant of 1989 and who is currently the 1st Vice President of the Royal Military Colleges Club of Canada. They have two young daughters together, Charlotte and Marcelle. Although the family resides in Markham, Ontario presently, Boudraeu’s \"birthplace [of Petit de Grat] greatly influences the themes of [her] writing for children.\" Boudreau is known to be \"...a compulsive walker, a chicklet wrangler and a lover of cheese and cheap chocolate.\" Authors that inspire Boudreau include Madeleine L’Engle, Louis Sachar, Katherine Paterson and Kate DiCamillo. She is also an active member of The Writers' Union of Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His family was a noble family (or \"szlachta\") of a former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. According to his friend Lev Tikhomirov, Hryniewiecki called himself a Litvin.\n\nIn 1875 Hryniewiecki left for Saint Petersburg, where he enrolled in mathematics at the Polytechnic. Soon he joined the Russian revolutionary \"Narodnaya Volya\" (People's Will) movement.\n\nIn 1880 Hryniewiecki, Andrei Zhelyabov, Sophia Perovskaya and others were in charge of revolutionary propaganda among students and workers. Hryniewiecki was an organizer of the \"Workers' Gazette\" and a typesetter at a clandestine printing establishment.\n\nIn February 1881 Hryniewiecki joined the bomb-throwing unit created to assassinate Tsar Alexander II.\n\nThe night before the assassination, Hryniewiecki wrote a letter to posterity, part of which reads:\n\nOn 13 March 1881, (1 March O.S.) Alexander II was traveling in a two-seater carriage. An armed Cossack sat next to the coach-driver with Alexander II in the carriage while six other Cossacks followed on horseback. As the carriage approached a street corner near the Catherine Canal, Sophia Perovskaya gave the signal to Nikolai Rysakov and Timofei Mikhailov to throw their bombs. The Tsar was unharmed but two were wounded. Alexander II insisted upon leaving the carriage to check on the wounded. At this point Hryniewiecki, who was leaning against the railing by the canal fence, raised both arms and threw his bomb and the blast tore the Tsar apart. Just before throwing the bomb he was alleged to have shouted \"It is too soon to thank God\", in response to the emperor saying \"thank God I'm untouched\" to the anxious inquires of his entourage. Nearby, Hryniewiecki himself lay unconscious from the blast.\n\nHryniewiecki was taken to the infirmary attached to the Winter Palace. At 9 PM he regained consciousness, refusing to give any information to the police. He died from his wounds at 10:30 PM.\n\nThe assassination had been meant to ignite revolution. Hryniewiecki's fellow-conspirators — Nikolai Kibalchich, Sophia Perovskaya, Nikolai Rysakov, Timofei Mikhailov, Andrei Zhelyabov — were sentenced to death and were hanged on 3 April 1881. They were buried in an anonymous common grave.\n\nThe Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was erected on the site of the assassination.\n\n"}

At the time of her death, she was the assistant director of public prosecution and head of the International Criminal Division in Uganda's Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.\n\nShe was born Joan Namazzi to Kaggwa Sserwadda and Mrs. Sserwadda of Luteete Village, Rakai District, on 14 July 1967. She attended Nsuube Primary School from 1973 to 1980. She studied at Mount Saint Mary's College Namagunga, an all-girls boarding senior secondary school in Mukono District, for both her O-Level and A-Level education. In 1987, she entered Makerere University to study law, graduating in 1990 with a Bachelor of Laws degree. In 1992, she earned a Diploma in Legal Practice from the Law Development Centre. At the time of her death, she was pursuing a Master of Business Administration from the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute.\n\nThroughout her 23-year career as an attorney, Kagezi served as a public servant with the government of Uganda. Straight out of the Law Development Centre in 1992, she secured a position as land officer in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. In May 1994, she was appointed a state attorney in the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. She received a promotion in February 2002 to principal state attorney. In August 2007, she was promoted to senior principal state attorney. In January 2015, she was appointed head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of assistant director of public prosecutions.\n\nOn 30 March 2015, at about 7.30 pm local time, Kagezi, who was driving an official Ford double-cabin pick up with government number plates without security, stopped at a road-side stand to buy fresh vegetables in the Kampala suburb of Kiwaatule. Her intended final destination was her home in the adjacent neighbourhood called Najjera. In the pick-up with her were three of her four children, two girls and one boy. One of the girls left the vehicle to pick up the products while the rest of the family stayed in the vehicle. While the girl was walking back to the car, a man approached the truck. He knocked on the driver's window which was closed, appearing to be making an inquiry. When Kagezi opened the window, the man shot her twice in the neck at close range, jumped on the back of a waiting motor cycle (boda boda), and sped off. She was rushed to Mulago National Referral Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival at about 8.00 pm. She was 47 years old.\n\nAmong the high-profile prosecutions that Joan Kagezi participated in or led, over her 21 years as a government prosecutor were the following:\n\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Makerere University in the late 1980s, she met her future husband, Henry Morton Kagezi. He died of natural causes in 2006. Together, they hadtwo boys and two girls: George Phillip Kagezi born in 1993, Carol Milcah Kagezi born in 1994, Pearl Priscilla Kagezi born in 1999, and John Harvey Kagezi born in 2004. President Yoweri Museveni has pledged to pay the children's school fees until each child determines that he or she decides to end his or her education.\n\nOn 8 April 2015, a heavily armed force of Ugandan and U.S. security officials apprehended Jamal Abdullah Kiyemba, an individual formerly held in Guantanamo. While there was no conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the killing of Kagezi, detectives were questioning him about his possible role in that crime and a range of other offenses.\n\n"}

They may be known best for the U.S. editions of all five Borrowers books by Mary Norton, published by Harcourt 1953–1961 and 1982, a series inaugurated very early in their careers.\n\nBeth was born March 31, 1918 in Washington, DC. As a girl she enjoyed visiting the city institutions and special events and drawing at home. Joseph Krush was born May 18, 1918 in Camden, New Jersey, and raised there. As a boy he won some prizes for drawings of boats and planes.\n\nBeth and Joe both studied at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, where they met on the first day of class. They married during World War II and settled in Wayne, Pennsylvania, south of the city, in 1948. They still lived there when Beth died in 2009 (in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania).\n\nJoe has had a life-long love of aviation. He designed, built and flew award winning model aircraft since 1930. Joe has set numerous indoor freeflight records as a member of the Academy of Model Aeronautics and FAI. He helped organize the Valley Forge Signal Seekers (Pennsylvania) one of oldest Radio Control Model Airplane clubs in the USA. Joe is still active in mentoring students involved with the flying events in Science Olympiad as well as his long-standing art classes on illustrating.\n\nThe Krushes had one son, the musician Jay Paul Krush. Joe Krush turned 100 in May 2018.\n\nJoe worked as a graphic designer for O.S.S. during the war. He was a courtroom sketch artist at the Nuremberg Trials 1945–1946. Beth taught illustration and drawing at Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, for at least 15 years.\n\nBoth of the Krushes illustrated books that Harcourt, Brace published in 1947. Joe did \"Windwagon Smith and Other Yarns\", a collection of short stories by Wilbur Schramm. Beth did \"Mr. Doodle\" by Sally Scott. Sarah Scott Fisher, the daughter of Dorothy Canfield Fisher, was a prolific writer of children's picture books whom Harcourt teamed with multiple illustrators. The Library of Congress online catalog lists 16 Sally Scott and Beth Krush collaborations published from 1947 to 1963.\n\nThe Krushes planned to work separately but they helped each other meet deadlines and that collaboration was noticed and approved by editors.\n\nBeside \"The Borrowers\" and its sequels, some famous books illustrated jointly by the Krushes were \"Miracles on Maple Hill\" (1956) by Virginia Sorensen (who won the Newbery Medal as its writer); \"Gone-Away Lake\" and its sequel, by Elizabeth Enright (1957, 1961); and \"All-of-a-Kind Family Downtown\" by Sydney Taylor (1972).\n\nBefore collaborating with his wife, Joe Krush illustrated the dustjacket and the interior of \"Huon of the Horn\", published by Harcourt in 1951, an adaptation of \"Huon de Bordeaux\" that was Andre Norton's first fantasy novel. A few years later he did the same for \"The Ponder Heart\" by Eudora Welty, published in 1953/1954.\n\nBeside collaborating with her husband, Beth Krush illustrated \"The Shoe Bird\" (1964), the only children's book by Eudora Welty.\n\nThere are two collections of Krush papers at the University of Minnesota and one item at the University of Southern Mississippi. All of the materials date from 1964 and earlier.\n\n"}

The live shows started on 31 October. In a change from previous series, there were seven weeks of live shows instead of the usual ten. Viewers were asked to decide which categories would be assigned to each judge by voting on Twitter during the series premiere. The results were announced on the day the Six Chair Challenge was filmed. Nick Grimshaw mentored the Boys, Rita Ora mentored the Girls, Simon Cowell mentored the Overs and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini mentored the Groups.\n\nThe twelve chosen finalists were Ché Chesterman, Seann Miley Moore, Mason Noise, Louisa Johnson, Lauren Murray, Kiera Weathers, Bupsi, Anton Stephans, Max Stone, Alien Uncovered, 4th Impact and Reggie n Bollie. On 29 October, Monica Michael (from the Girls category) was announced as the only wildcard on this series, with all four judges agreeing on it.\n\nThe \"Boys\" category is mentored by Nick Grimshaw. Contestants in this category are male soloists aged between 16 and 25. The six candidates at judges' houses were: Ché Chesterman, Ben Clark, Josh Daniels, Simon Lynch, Seann Miley Moore, and Mason Noise. Grimshaw chose:\n\nChé George Chesterman, Jr. (born 18 August 1996) is a singer-songwriter from Basildon, Essex. Prior to auditioning for \"The X Factor\", he used to work stacking shelves at a Tesco in Langdon, Essex, but quit to pursue his singing career. Chesterman's father, Ché Sr., auditioned for series 3 of \"The X Factor\" in 2006 and made it through to boot camp. Chesterman studied music at college, which is where he realised his passion for performing. He was the lead singer of a band called Jinx, before they split and he decided to audition for the show.\n\nWith the eliminations of Seann Miley Moore in week two and Mason Noise in week four, Chesterman became Grimshaw's last remaining act in the competition. Chesterman was in the bottom two in week four alongside Anton Stephans, but was saved after only Cowell voted to send him home. He was in the bottom two again in week six alongside Lauren Murray and was sent through to the final after the result went to deadlock. He finished in third place in the competition. Chesterman took part in The X Factor Live Tour 2016.\n\nSeann Miley Moore (born 30 October 1990) is originally from Sydney. He brought a one way ticket and moved to London in order to take part in the competition. When he was younger, Moore went to a British American International school in Asia. However, his family moved and he grew up in Sydney. Moore originally wanted to be a tennis player and realised his singing dream after performing his father's favourite song, \"Tears in Heaven\" at a school acoustic night.He auditioned for many musicals and got main parts in several of them.\n\nSeann performed \"The Show Must Go On\" at his audition. Seann was in the bottom three in week two. He performed (\" A song for you\") in the sing-off against Mason Noise, and despite both Cowell and Fernadez-Versini praising his performance, the result went to deadlock because Ora voted against him and Grimshaw did not want to decide since he mentored both acts. Moore was revealed as the act with the fewest votes and was eliminated. He came in tenth place. Although Moore was not in the top seven, he was given a place on The X Factor Live Tour 2016.\n\nMason Dominic Binnell, (born 4 August 1993) known by his stage name Mason Noise, is a part-time McDonald's worker from Birmingham.\nBefore \"The X Factor\" he released a few songs and videos that didn't quite make 100 views on YouTube.\n\nNoise was a controversial act because during the six-seat challenge, after performing for his mentor Grimshaw, Noise complained that his audition was only broadcast for 47 seconds while other contestants were featured for up to 10 minutes. Simon Cowell responded by saying \"You should feel lucky to be on this show. Why don't you shut up?\" and called Noise an \"arsehole\". Noise was booed by the crowd before dropping the microphone and walking off the stage. Noise later told the Daily Mirror: \"[Simon] lost control and it was uncalled for. Especially as all I was doing was saying an opinion. I think that no one has ever questioned him before and no one has questioned the format of the show. Something needs to change on that show. Listen to the kids, at the end of the day I have a lot of support on Twitter.\" When contestant Tom Bleasby had withdrawn from the show for personal reasons, there was a spare place at judges' houses. On 15 October, Grimshaw announced that Noise would replace Bleasby at judges' houses. There was a negative response about this decision from the media due to Noise's behaviour at the six-chair challenge, although the remaining five candidates defended Noise, stating that his attitude had significantly improved since the six-chair challenge.\n\nAt judges' houses, Grimshaw put Noise through to the live shows. This decision was met with a mixture of cheers and boos from the audience.\n\nNoise was in the bottom three in week two, having to perform on the sing-off against Seann Miley Moore. Initially, Cowell and Fernandez-Versini voted to send him home because of his sing-off performance. However, Ora claimed that she saw something in him and voted against Moore. Their mentor, Grimshaw, did not want to decide between the two and the result went to deadlock, which guaranteed Noise another week. Noise was eliminated in week 4 after receiving the fewest votes on Saturday. He finished in seventh place. Noise took part in the 2016 X Factor Live Tour.\n\nHe has released the singles \"Blow the doors off\", \"Take your seat\", \"Boyfriend\", \"Heat\", \"Loco\", \"She drives me crazy\" and \"Stranger\" (& My Boyz Beatz)\n\nThe \"Girls\" category is mentored by Rita Ora. Contestants in this category are female soloists aged 16–25. The six candidates at judges' houses were: Louisa Johnson, Monica Michael, Lauren Murray, Chloe Paige, Havva Rebke, and Kiera Weathers. Ora chose:\n\nLouisa Johnson (born 11 January 1998) was a 17-year-old student at the time of her audition. She is from Chafford Hundred, Essex, and attended St Thomas' RC Primary School in Grays, Essex. Following the eliminations of Kiera Weathers in week two, Monica Michael in week three and Lauren Murray in week six Johnson became Ora's last act in the competition and the only girl to make the final. On 13 December 2015 Johnson was crowned winner of series 12 with 53.9% of the final vote. Johnson took part in The X Factor Live Tour 2016. Johnson's debut winner single \"Forever Young\" was released after she won the show. Since winning the show, Johnson has featured on Clean Bandit track \"Tears\" which got to number five in the UK.\n\nMonica Michael (born 21 October 1989) is a youth worker from North London and is this series' wildcard contestant. She originally auditioned for series 11 and got through to bootcamp, but failed to progress past the six-chair challenge after being eliminated by her potential mentor Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. She returned for this series and was eliminated during judges houses by judge Rita Ora but was brought back as a wildcard act as all four judges felt she should have got through.\n\nMichael was in the bottom three in week three. She performed in the sing-off against Anton Stephans, receiving Cowell's and Grimshaw's votes to eliminate her. The result went to deadlock and she was sent home as the act with the fewest votes. Michael finished in seventh place, missing out on a place in The X Factor Live Tour 2016. Since leaving the show, Michael has released \"Pretty Little Sister\" and \"My Angel\" which she sang at her 2014 audition and judges houses in 2015. In 2018, she released her third single \"Wish you love\", followed by the songs \"Diamond in the rough\", \"Soldier\" and \"Long gone\".\n\nLauren Murray (born 7 October 1990) is a dental receptionist from North London. She was eight years old when she started singing. However, her father died when she was eleven, she lost confidence, and did not sing again until she was sixteen. Lauren planned to release her debut single in February 2014 available on her YouTube channel.\n\nMurray was in the bottom two in week five alongside 4th Impact and was saved by the public vote due to the judges taking the decision to deadlock. However, in week six, Murray was in the bottom two alongside Ché Chesterman where deadlock occurred once again, and public voting automatically eliminated Murray, leaving her in fourth place. Murray took part in The X Factor Live Tour 2016.\n\nIn 2015, she released the single \"Each time I see you\" with Marvel Riot. In 2018, she released the song \"Boss girl\" and the EP \"Worth it\".\n\nKiera Laikan Weathers (born 25 March 1997) is a barmaid from St Helens.\n\nWeathers was in the bottom three on week one, facing the sing-off with Alien Uncovered. Weathers was saved after her mentor Rita Ora, Nick Grimshaw and Simon Cowell voted to send Alien Uncovered home and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini voted to send Weathers home. Results polls released post-series revealed that Weathers had received the fewest votes in week one meaning if Cowell sent the result to deadlock, Alien Uncovered would have been saved. She was in the bottom three once again on week two, but this time received the fewest votes and was automatically eliminated, coming in eleventh place.\n\nKiera Weathers released her debut single 'You Gotta Be' on 9 December 2016 and it was re-released on 31 March 2017 after she signed a record deal with Warner Music UK:\n\n\"She originally released this track in late December last year, I heard it one Saturday night and immediately knew I wanted to sign it, so I tweeted Kiera to ask if we could exchange emails. Within the course of a few hours on a Saturday evening, between Kiera and her manager, we had agreed on a deal.\" - Kieron Donoghue, Warner Music \nIn 2017, she released the singles \"Hurt so good\" (feat. Marc) and \"Talk to me\".\n\nThe 'Overs' category is mentored by Simon Cowell. Contestants in the category are male and female soloists age 26+.. The six candidates at judges' houses were: Bupsi, Ebru, Jennifer Phillips, Kerrie-Anne Phillips, Anton Stephans, and Max Stone. Cowell chose:\n\nNicola Brown, known by her stage name Bupsi, is a singer from Leeds. Before appearing on the show, she was working as a Tina Turner and Chic tribute act.\n\nBupsi was automatically eliminated in week one after receiving the fewest public votes, coming in thirteenth place.\n\nAnton Stephans (born Stephen Johnson) is a former backing vocalist from Suffolk and has worked with Tina Turner, Elton John and Sting. He also once performed with Sinitta in a West End musical.\n\nWith the eliminations of Bupsi in week 1 and Max Stone on week three, Stephans became Cowell's last remaining act in the competition. He was in the bottom three on week three and had to perform in the sing-off against Monica Michael, receiving Ora's and Fernandez-Versini's votes to be eliminated. The result was deadlocked and he was spared since he had the most votes. The following week, he was in the bottom two alongside Ché Chesterman and was eliminated by the judges, receiving only Cowell's vote to save him and becoming the last of his acts to leave the competition. He finished in sixth place. He took part in The X Factor Live Tour 2016.\n\nMax Stone is a singer and songwriter from London. He was born in Devon and moved to Sweden when he was young. He spent twelve years there before moving back to the UK. Stone was influenced by his father's records and listened to soul and Motown. He credits music for helping him get out of his \"wild child\" ways. He wrote his first song when he was ten years old and his biggest musical achievement was performing at the Roundhouse in Camden with Jimmy Cliff and Maxi Priest. Max left the show in week three after being in the bottom three and being automatically eliminated as the act with the fewest public votes. He finished in ninth place.\n\nThe 'Groups' category is mentored by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Contestants in this category are either duos or vocal harmony groups, all aged sixteen and over. The six candidates at judges' houses were: 4th Impact, Alien Uncovered, BEKLN Mile, Melody Stone, New King Order, and Reggie n Bollie. Fernandez-Versini chose:\n\n4th Impact (formerly known as The Cercado Sisters, The Cercados, The Gollayan Sisters, MICA, and 4th Power) are a girl group from the Philippines consisting of Almira, Irene, Mylene, and Celina Cercado who have been singing and dancing together since 2001. Before \"The X Factor\", they had previously competed in several Philippine and international talent competitions. They are originally from Santiago City in the Philippines, but now live in Metro Manila.\n\nFor the first four weeks of the X Factor live shows, 4th Impact sailed through the competition, earning nothing but positive comments from the four judges for their performances. In the fifth week of the live shows, however, the group found themselves in the bottom two for the first time in the competition. Being one of the two acts who received the fewest public votes, they had to perform against fellow contestant Lauren Murray for a place in the competition. The judges' decision on the face-off, however, were split, so the public vote was consulted and 4th Impact was eliminated, finishing in fifth place, having received the fewest votes that week.\n\nAfter their elimination from the X Factor, 4th Impact traveled on \"The X Factor Live Tour\". Polls conducted by the show's producers prior to the tour showed 4th Impact as the most anticipated act in the tour's lineup. Subsequently, a poll conducted after the tour named 4th Impact as the best act of the show. In January 2017, the group released their debut single \"Unleash the Diva\"\n\nAlien Uncovered (formerly Alien) are a five-piece girl group consisting of Madison, Natalie, Shae, Temple, and Yasmin \"Yaz\" Crotch. During their time on the show, they also had a sixth member, Frank. The band came up with their name after people kept staring at them on a train because of the way they looked, stating: \"We felt like aliens... so we thought it would be a good name for the band.\" They have been together for over a year and are all former dancers.\n\nAlien Uncovered were eliminated in week one after ending up in the sing-off with Kiera Weathers, receiving Rita Ora's, Nick Grimshaw's and Simon Cowell's votes to be sent home but Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (their mentor) voted to save them. Result polls released after the end of the series revealed that if Cowell sent the vote to deadlock, Alien Uncovered would've been saved. They finished in 12th place. A few days before their group performance with the other contestants at the final, Frank abruptly left the band, later claiming she was being forced to by the other members. In 2017, the girl group released their debut single \"Handle It\".\n\nReggie 'n' Bollie (formerly Menn on Poinnt) are a duo from Ghana consisting of Reggie Zippy (born Reginald Anusson, 15 July 1984) and Bollie Babeface (born Ishmael Hamid, 2 July 1986). They have been living in the UK with their families for the past five years. The pair both separately released Hiplife style music in Ghana. Reggie released three songs in 2006 called \"Virgin\", \"4 Sale\" and \"Adoma\". In 2004, Bollie also had a hit, \"You May Kiss the Bride\" popular at weddings. With the eliminations of Alien Uncovered in week one and 4th Impact in week five, Reggie 'n' Bollie became Fernandez-Versini's sole remaining act in the competition and subsequently were announced as runners-up in the final, losing out to Louisa Johnson. They took part in The X Factor Live Tour 2016.\n\nReggie 'n' Bollie signed to Syco Music on 20 January 2016. They released their first single \"New Girl\" on 13 May through Syco.\n"}

Fine's mother died while Fine was attending Cooper Union college, studying engineering. He had an older brother, Sam, who died in October 2000, at age 86, and a sister. According to Fine's son Elliot, Lou Fine's family lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood of \"East New York, which was called Brownsville in those days... It was a tenement Jewish neighborhood back then\".\n\nEither at about age two or in his early teens, Fine's left leg became crippled by polio. Developing a talent for art, and influenced by such commercial illustrators and other artists as Dean Cornwell, Heinrich Kley, and J.C. Leyendecker, Fine went on to study at Manhattan's Grand Central Art School and Brooklyn's Pratt Institute. In 1938, Fine, like many other comics artists of the time, found work at Eisner & Iger, a prominent \"packager\" that supplied complete comic books to publishers testing the waters of the emerging medium. Fine's first published comics art was the strip \"Wilton of the West\" in Fiction House's \"Jumbo Comics\" #4 (Dec. 1938), signed with the house pen name Fred Sande (which strip originator Jack Kirby had used in previous issues). Other early pseudonyms Fine employed (reflecting the fledgling Eisner & Iger's attempts to convince publishers they had a large stable of artists) were Curt Davis and Basil Berold. Eisner would later say, \"I had respect for his towering kind of draftsmanship. He was the epitome of the honest draftsman. No fakery, no razzle-dazzle — very direct, very honest in his approach\".\n\nFine went on to do exquisite and acclaimed work for Fox Feature Syndicate, where he supplied the cover of 1939's \"Blue Beetle\" #1 and drew such features as \"The Flame\" in \"Wonderworld Comics\" and the later eponymous series. For publisher Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold's Quality Comics, he drew features including \"The Black Condor\" (initially under the pseudonym Kenneth Lewis) in \"Crack Comics\"; \"Doll Man\" (under the pseudonym William Erwin Maxwell) in \"Feature Comics\"; \"The Ray\" (initially under the jokey pseudonym E. Lectron) in \"Smash Comics\"; \"Uncle Sam\" (for which Eisner & Iger co-founder Will Eisner received credit) in \"National Comics\"; and \"Stormy Foster\" in \"Hit Comics\". Fine became particularly prominent as a cover artist.\n\nFine, along with \"Plastic Man\" creator Jack Cole, was a ghost-artist on Will Eisner's celebrated Sunday-supplement newspaper comic book \"The Spirit\" during Eisner's World War II military service, Fine inking over Cole's pencil work. Some of these were reprinted in Quality's \"Police Comics\" and \"The Spirit\" comic book, where Fine's work continued to appear through 1949, five years after Fine had left comics.\n\nJoe Simon, an artist and the first editor of Marvel Comics, called Fine his \"favorite artist... He was also Jack Kirby's favorite artist. I know that Jack was a fan of and greatly influenced by Fine’s work\".\n\nLeaving comic books in 1944, Fine segued into newspapers by drawing Sunday advertising comics. Starting out at Johnstone and Cushing, he formed his own company with Don Komisarov, whom he had met doing \"The Throp Family\" for \"Liberty Magazine\" in 1946. He had many accounts, but his two most enduring were the series he did for Philip Morris and the Sam Spade strip for Wildroot haircream.\n\nHe later drew the comic strips \"Taylor Woe\" (1949), \"Adam Ames\" (1959) and \"Peter Scratch\" (1965). In a single return to comic books, he contributed to a toy company's custom one-shot, \"Wham-O Giant Comics\" (1967), illustrating a two-page story, \"The Man From Aeons\", starring a prehistoric man who, though named \"Tor\", was not the same-name caveman character created in the 1950s by Joe Kubert.\n\nFine also worked on the strip \"Space Conquerors\" in the magazine \"Boys' Life\" from the late 1960s until his death. He and writer Gill Fox, whom he had met during his time with Eisner & Iger and remained in contact with, were developing new comic strips when Fine was found dead of a heart attack at the threshold of his studio.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Fine lived in affluent Lido Beach, New York, on Long Island, owning two houses there. Friend and collaborator Gill Fox described them as, \"One for his wife and one for himself. He lived alone [by then]\".\n\nAtlas Comics (retailer), \"The Top 100 Artists of American Comic Books\": #10 - Lou Fine: \"By God, Lou Fine could draw. One of comics' first illustrative stars, he influenced and astounded such later greats as Alex Toth, Jim Steranko, and Gil Kane. His covers alone during the ' 40s stand as some of the best-designed and most exciting work ever produced for any comic book publisher\".\n\nFine's \"Spirit\" work has been reprinted in DC Comics' hardcover collections \"The Spirit Archives\" vols. 5 to 9 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 to December 1944.\n\nSelections of Fine's other comics works, including the Flame, Doll Man, Uncle Sam, the Ray, and Black Condor, have been reprinted in Pure Imagination's \"Lou Fine Reader\", by Greg Theakston, vols. 1 (2003, ) and 2.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "853954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=853954", "title": "Maria Dermoût", "text": "Maria Dermoût\n\nMaria Dermoût (15 June 1888 – 27 June 1962), was an Indo-European novelist, considered one of the greats of Dutch literature and as such an important proponent of Dutch Indies literature. In December 1958 \"Time\" magazine praised the translation of Maria Dermoût's \"The Ten Thousand Things\", and named it one of the best books of the year.\n\nWhitney Balliett of \"The New Yorker\" wrote: \"Mrs. Dermout, in the manner of Thoreau and the early Hemingway, is an extraordinary sensualist. [...] in passages of a startling, unadorned, three-dimensional clarity; often one can almost touch what she describes.\"\n\nDermoût was a Dutch novelist born in Pati, Java, Dutch East Indies, and educated in the Netherlands, who wrote in Dutch. After completing her education she returned to Java, where she married and travelled extensively across Java and the Moluccas with her husband. In 1933 her husband was pensioned, and the couple returned to the Netherlands. Maria Dermoût was widowed in 1952.\n\nDermoût died in The Hague in 1962. She is the subject of the biography \"Geheim Indië. Het leven van Maria Dermoût 1888-1962\" (\"The Secret East Indies. The Life of Maria Dermoût 1888-1962\") in 2000 by the Indo-European (Dutch-Indonesian) author Kester Freriks.\n\nDermoût turned to writing early in life, but remained largely unpublished until she was 63. She wrote two novels, both of which were not published until she was in her sixties: \"The Ten Thousand Things\" (\"De tienduizend dingen\", 1955) and \"Days Before Yesterday\" — also published as \"Just Yesterday\" (\"Nog pas gisteren\", 1951). There are English translations of her novels by Hans Koning. Some of her short stories were published in translation in magazines such as \"Vogue\" during the 1960s. In Dutch, five short-story collections by her were also published.\n\nShe is viewed as one of the giants among Dutch-Indies literary writers, and \"The Ten Thousand Things\" in particular is widely regarded as an idiosyncratic masterpiece. The book has been translated into thirteen languages. As Hans Koning puts it in his Introduction to the New York Review Books edition of the novel:\n\"Dermoût was sui generis, a case all her own. She did not write about her Indies as a Dutch woman, or as a Javanese or an Ambonese. Hers was a near-compassionate disdain for the dividing lines, the hatreds and the fears ... She \"painted\" landscapes, still lifes and people in a world of myth and mystery.\"\nAlthough not conventionally autobiographical, both of her novels draw from Dermoût's own life. In particular, like the central character in \"The Ten Thousand Things\", Dermoût lost her son in violent circumstances (he died in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp). The Javanese childhood experiences and reminiscences described in \"Days Before Yesterday\" are based on, but do not mirror, her own childhood in the tropics.\nAuthor Oek de Jong appropriately wrote:\n\n\"Still, Maria Dermoût an author for the happy few. Is she a writer's writer? Certainly not. She is a storyteller par excellence. Her stories are subtle, but they are also accessible. Nonetheless she remains an author for the happy few, equal to the greats of Dutch prose, but much less known than they are. There are many reasons for her modest literary reputation: her own modesty, the small body of her work, the brevity of her literary career. But it is mainly her work itself that is the cause. It possesses something that wards off hordes of readers, yet still manages to attract a handful, who then embrace it and spread the word of its exquisite nature. The shell seekers among the readers, the slow walkers, those who stop and turn and bend over to pick up that one beautiful shell - they recognize her extraordinary work.\"\n\n"}

At the crime scene, the Mexican authorities discovered several shell casings from assault rifles, the habitual weapon of the Mexican organized crime groups. The motive of the killing, however, remains unknown.\n\nAs a youth, Cordero completed her primary school education from Escuela Primaria Enrique Rebsamen, and then went on to middle school at the State Junior High Number 15. Upon graduation, she attended high school at an institution called III del Colegio de Bachilleres.\n\nBefore enrolling at the University of Chihuahua to study Accounting and Business administration, Cordero's mother suggested that she participate in a casting for a local television program hosted by Televisa. To her surprise, Cordero was selected from a pool of contestants to work as the anchorwoman for the television program. During her three-year career on Televisa, her show – although generally directed at housewives – attracted both men and women. After working for more than three years at Televisa, Cordero resigned to work as the director of public relations at the CANACO, Chihuahua city's Chamber of Commerce. Cordero also opened a small shirt printing business where she sold T-shirts and blouses with peace messages in response to the drug violence in her home state.\n\nCordero was about to graduate from the University of Chihuahua in June 2010 and was pursuing her graduate studies in the United States.\n\nOn 16 April 2010, Cordero and her friend María Catalina Flores Aguayo (age 22) went out for dinner at a local restaurant in Chihuahua, Chihuahua when an armed commando opened fire at them from a moving vehicle at around 11:00 p.m., killing them instantly. Their bodies were found inside a parked white Renault Mégane near the corner of Bahía de San Quintín and Libertadores streets in the northern part of the capital city.\n\nAfter the gunmen left the scene, witnesses dialed 060 and notified the Mexican authorities of the attack. The first to arrive were the Municipal police forces and then the Red Cross ambulances, which confirmed that the two women had died instantly from more than 20 gunshot wounds.\n\nThe shell casings found at the crime scene belonged to an assault rifle, which is a weapon often used by organized crime. But the motive behind the assassination remains unknown. It was rumored by people in Chihuahua that Cordero was dating someone involved in organized crime and was killed because of that. This information was not confirmed.\n\nThe Cordero family held a wake for María Isabella at the Blas Perches funeral home and a mass ceremony conducted by Father Jesús José Mata Trejo at 3:00 p.m. at the Asunción de María temple. She was later buried at the La Colina de Chihuahua in the capital city by dozens of friends and family members on the afternoon of 18 April 2010.\n\nWith the death of Cordero, the death toll of journalists killed in Mexico in 2010 reached six. If the journalists killed since the year 2000 are counted, the number of journalists killed would be of more than 60, according to a report issued by Reporters Without Borders.\n\nCordero was killed in the state of Chihuahua in 2010, reported to be \"the most violent state in Mexico\" at that time. Almost one-third of all murders in the general population committed by the drug cartels during the Mexican Drug War (between 2006 and 2010) happened in the state of Chihuahua. Chihuahua, and particularly the border city of Ciudad Juárez, was the epicenter of Mexico's drug war as the battle between the Sinaloa Cartel and Juárez Cartel left thousands of dead.\n\nSince May 2008, Chihuahua had ranked at the top of the homicide list in the country. But by October 2012, the state of Guerrero surpassed Chihuahua as the state with the highest homicide rate in Mexico. The northern state of Nuevo León ranks third.\n\n"}

{"id": "313472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313472", "title": "Michel Petrucciani", "text": "Michel Petrucciani\n\nMichel Petrucciani (; ; 28 December 1962 – 6 January 1999) was a French jazz pianist. From birth he had osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disease that causes brittle bones and, in his case, short stature. He became one of the most accomplished jazz pianists of his generation despite having arms that caused him pain.\n\nMichel Petrucciani came from an Italo-French family (his grandfather was from Naples) with a musical background. His father Tony played guitar, his brother Louis played bass, and his brother Philippe also plays the guitar. Michel was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, which is a genetic disease that causes brittle bones and, in his case, short stature. It is also often linked to pulmonary ailments. The disease caused his bones to fracture over 100 times before he reached adolescence and kept him in pain throughout his entire life. \"I have pain all the time. I'm used to having hurt arms,\" he said. In Michel's early career, his father and brother occasionally carried him because he could not walk far on his own unaided. In certain respects he considered his disability an advantage, as he got rid of distractions like sports that other boys tended to become involved in. And he hints that his disability was helpful in other parts of his life. He said: \"Sometimes I think someone upstairs saved me from being ordinary.\"\n\nAt an early age, Michel saw Duke Ellington on television and wished to become a pianist like him. When Michel was four, his father bought him a toy piano of his own, but Michel smashed the piano with a toy hammer. \"When I was young, I thought the keyboard looked like teeth,\" he said. \"It was as though it was laughing at me. You had to be strong enough to make the piano feel little. That took a lot of work.\" Soon after this, Michel's father bought him a real piano.\n\nFrom the beginning, Petrucciani had always been musical, reportedly humming Wes Montgomery solos by the time he learned to speak. He began learning classical piano at the age of four, and was making music with his family by the age of nine. The musician that would prove most influential to Petrucciani was Bill Evans, whom he began listening to at around the age of ten. Petrucciani's layered harmonies, lyrical style, and articulation of melody have always been linked most strongly to this early exposure to Evans.\n\nPetrucciani gave his first professional concert at the age of 13. At this point of his life, he was still quite fragile and had to be carried to and from the piano. His hands were average in length, but his size meant that he required aids to reach the piano's pedals.\n\nPetrucciani felt he needed to travel to Paris to begin his musical career, but he found it difficult to leave home. His father was protective, constantly concerned for his son's well-being and reluctant to put him in any danger. Petrucciani's drummer Aldo Romano said of Michel's father: \"[He] was an idiot. He didn't trust anybody. He wanted to keep Petrucciani as a partner, to play music with. He was very jealous. So I had to fight to take him to Paris, because his father didn't want me to, because he wanted to keep him, like you would cage a monster.\"\n\nPetrucciani made his first trip to Paris at the age of fifteen. There he played with Kenny Clarke in 1977 and Clark Terry in 1978. His breakthrough performance occurred at the Cliousclat jazz festival. Terry was missing a pianist, and when Petrucciani was carried onto the stage, he thought it was a joke; Petrucciani was not more than three feet tall. But he astounded Terry and the rest of the festival with his prodigious talent and virtuosity. Terry said, \"When I heard him play – oh, man! He was a dwarf, but he played like a giant. I said, 'listen, little guy – don't run away. I'll be back for you.'\"\n\nPetrucciani's trip to Paris garnered mixed experiences but was undoubtedly musically and personally transforming. He reports, \"It was mostly to do with drugs and weird women, but I was lucky and got out safe.\" His attitude during his time in France was largely immature and insecure, despite his considerable talent. He wore a yachtsman's cap and frequently acted pushy and tough, referring to people as 'baby'. \"He acted tough and pushy, and his playing was tough and pushy. He knew how to say 'motherfucker' in French,\" said Michael Zwerin, who met Petrucciani when the pianist was fifteen. Petrucciani played in a trio with Kenny Clarke during his time in Paris and rose to stardom.\n\nAfter his stint in Paris, Petrucciani briefly returned to home before beginning his professional life. Living with his drummer, Romano, he was free of the protective presence of his father and began enjoying an independent lifestyle. Petrucciani began recording with Owl Records and struck up a friendship with the recording company's owner, Jean-Jacques Pussiau. Pussiau recalls that Petrucciani always seemed to be in a hurry to record, saying, \"I don't want to lose time.\" Eventually however Petrucciani desired independence from Romano, too. Romano remembers: \"He didn't feel free with me. So he had to kill his second father somehow to move on. He needed to escape. He needed to go very far, as far as he could go, and that was California.\"\n\nPetrucciani travelled to the U.S. after his trip to Paris, but it is not known whether he stopped in New York first. \"Michel was really into bullshitting...he would lie to your face,\" said French journalist Thierry Peremarti. This calls into question his strange account of his time in Manhattan. He claimed to have scammed his way into the city on bad checks and hid out in Brooklyn with the help of Sicilian family connections. He also claimed to have played piano in a midtown brothel.\n\nWhat is known for certain is that he ended up in California in 1982, where he visited retired saxophonist Charles Lloyd. Lloyd had stopped playing when people began to view his sidemen as more fashionable than he himself was. After hearing Petrucciani play, Lloyd was so inspired that he agreed to tour with him. Lloyd said to him, \"I was here planning to not play again. You triggered me. I heard this beauty in you and I said, 'well I have to take you 'round the world cause there's something so beautiful, it was like providence calling.\" Petrucciani and Lloyd's tour of the West Coast of the United States was a huge success and they continued internationally. On 22 February 1985, with Petrucciani cradled in his arms, Lloyd walked onto the stage at Town Hall in New York City and sat him on his piano stool for what would be a historic evening in jazz history: the filming of \"One Night with Blue Note\". The film's director John Charles Jopson would later recall in the reissued liner notes that the moment moved him to tears.\n\nPetrucciani and Lloyd's performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival was made into an album, and in 1982, they won the 1982 Prix d'Excellence. But Petrucciani expressed mostly disdain and frustration at the awards he felt were being heaped upon him, believing that he was receiving so many at least in part because people believed he was going to die young.\n\nPetrucciani moved to New York City in 1984 and spent the rest of his life there. This was the most productive period of his career. He recorded with Wayne Shorter and Jim Hall, producing the trio album \"Power of Three\". In 1986, Petrucciani recorded a live album with Wayne Shorter and Jim Hall. He also played with diverse figures in the U.S. jazz scene including Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nBut he made a priority of recording solo piano also. He said: \"I really believe a pianist is not complete until he's capable of playing by himself. I started doing solo concerts in February 1993, when I asked my agent to cancel my trio dates for a year in order to play nothing but solo recitals… I had a wonderful time playing alone, and discovering the piano and really studying every night. I felt like I was learning so much about the instrument and about communicating directly with an audience. So it was an incredible experience. I really loved doing that, and afterwards getting on stage with a group again and playing with other people was a piece of cake!\"\n\nRegarding his personal life, he had five significant relationships: Erlinda Montano (marriage), Eugenia Morrison, Marie-Laure Roperch, the Italian pianist Gilda Buttà (the marriage lasted three months and ended in divorce) and Isabelle Mailé (with whom he shares his grave). With Marie-Laure he fathered a son, Alexandre, who inherited his condition. He also had a stepson named Rachid Roperch.\n\nIn 1994, he was granted a Légion d'honneur in Paris.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Petrucciani's lifestyle became increasingly taxing. He was performing over 100 times per year, and in 1998, the year before he died, he performed 140 times. He became too weak to use crutches and had to resort to a wheelchair. His final manager said, \"He was working too much – not only recording and doing concerts, but he was always on television, and he was always doing interviews. He got himself overworked, and you could see it. He pushed too much.\" In his later years Petrucciani was known to drink heavily.\n\nPetrucciani died from a pulmonary infection a week after his 36th birthday. He was interred in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, one tomb away from Frédéric Chopin.\n\nOn 12 February 2009, the French music channel Mezzo broadcast a special event paying homage to Petrucciani on the 10th anniversary of his death.\n\nThe first two American albums featuring Petrucciani were produced by Gabreal Franklin. The first, \"100 Hearts\", a solo album, was produced at the famous RCA Studio A, on the Avenue of the Americas in New York City. The second was a trio album, recorded live at Max Gordon's old Village Vanguard club in New York City. These were among the first albums to use digital recording technology, on Mitsubishi X80 recorders, so early on that the only manuals available were in Japanese; but Franklin and Tom Arrison managed to get them to function by trial and error.\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta seemed to contribute greatly both to Petrucciani's personality and his playing style. By his own account, he was in almost constant physical pain. Yet, he was known for his cheerful, playful, even cavalier personality. He said, \"I love humor, I love to laugh, I love jokes, I love silliness, I love that, I think it's great, I think laughter is worth a whole lot of medicine.\"\n\nThough he often exhibited arrogance and even womanizing tendencies in his adolescent years, the defining characteristic of Petrucciani was his confidence. Michael Zwerin recalled one example: \"We were sitting there wondering what to play. It was kind of hot. And Michel said, 'anybody know \"Giant Steps?\" Neither Louis nor I wanted to admit we didn't really know it. So there was this great silence. And Michel said, \"Well, I do!\" and he pounded into a solo version of it at a very fast clip, and it was really amazing. That to me is Michel—'Well, I do!' Man, a confidence you wouldn't believe.\"\n\nPetrucciani also appeared to have a quirky side. In a Mezzo documentary, he can be heard saying in a humorous voice, \"I am very short!\" Pussiau, the owner of Owl Records, recalled when he used to carry Michel for convenience. \"Sometimes, when I used to carry him, he would bite my ear. We'd walk into a restaurant, and he'd \"chomp\".\n\nDuring his last years in New York, it seemed Michel's general attitude of carelessness was magnified. He said to his manager, \"I want to have at least five women at once, I want to make a million dollars in one night.\" A common theory is that Petrucciani's awareness of his greatly reduced lifespan compelled his perseverance, success, social life, and recklessness all to extremes, but this does not seem to be the case. Michel himself expressed denial of the life-shortening nature of his disease. In an interview, he said: \"My handicap is not mortal. I won't die because of my handicap. It has nothing to do with that.\" He also said, \"Eventually, when I get to be 75, I'll write a book on my deathbed.\" Yet other reliable sources assert that he was always aware of the potential effects of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\nWhat is known for certain is that Michel Petrucciani was fiercely determined to take all the joy and satisfaction from life that he could. \"I'm a brat,\" he said. \"My philosophy is to have a really good time and never let anything stop me from doing what I want to do. It's like driving a car, waiting for an accident. That's no way to drive a car. If you have an accident, you have an accident—\"c'est la vie\".\" He certainly lived true to his maxim. Just one week before he died of a pulmonary infection, he was up all night celebrating the new year with his friends.\n\nStylistically, Petrucciani is most frequently compared to Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett for his lyricism and Oscar Peterson for his virtuosity. His playing was often quite dramatic; critics accuse him of over-indulgence and cheap showmanship; sometimes dismiss his music as being too accessible. Petrucciani was loose and playful in a rhythm section, and gave attention to a strong articulation of the melody. He sometimes paused at the peaks of his solo lines before descending again, as if in appreciation of his idea.\n\nMichel distinguished himself most obviously from his primary inspiration in that he lacked Bill Evans's cerebral approach to the piano. Petrucciani's interest was primarily in simply playing; he spent little time reharmonizing or arranging. \"When I play, I play with my heart and my head and my spirit… I don't play to people's heads, but to their hearts.\" he says. The moments of musical clarity or bliss he describes come during his performances. \"You know sometimes when I play a concert… and I have that right timing… those notes make me feel warm and good… it's like lovemaking, it's like having an orgasm.\" Yet despite his emphasis on performance, he disliked applause, calling it old-fashioned and a distraction.\n\nMichel's unbridled love of the piano in no way entailed artistic carelessness. Indeed, he described the piano as literally taking him to his grave. \"It might lead me to death… meaning that I'd be on my deathbed saying, too bad I can't live another year, I would have been much better.\" He also complained about mistakes, saying, \"…the pitfall is that when I make a mistake it sounds absolutely outrageous, really horrible because everything else is so clear!\"\n\nWayne Shorter summed up Michel Petrucciani's essential character and style in this quote:\n\n\"There's a lot of people walking around, full-grown and so-called normal—they have everything that they were born with at the right leg length, arm length, and stuff like that. They're symmetrical in every way, but they live their lives like they are armless, legless, brainless, and they live their life with blame. I never heard Michel complain about anything.

{"id": "3116145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3116145", "title": "Military career of Hugo Chávez", "text": "Military career of Hugo Chávez\n\nThe military career of Hugo Chávez spans the seventeen years (1975–1992) that the later President of Venezuela spent in the Venezuelan army. Leader of the \"Bolivarian Revolution\", Chávez is known for his professed and self-proclaimed democratic socialist governance, his promotion of Latin American integration, and his radical critique of neoliberal globalization and United States foreign policy.\n\nBorn 28 July 1954 in rural Sabaneta, Chávez entered military service upon his graduation from the Military academy of Venezuela in 1975, as a military officer. Chávez thereafter held a variety of post, command, and staff positions. At the time, he was increasingly drawn into leftist political movements; he eventually engaged in electioneering and political conspiracy. Chávez led a violent 1992 civilian-military coup which sought to overthrow a democratically elected government that he saw as a corrupt oligarchy. Although the coup ultimately failed—ending Chávez's military career—it also brought Chávez into the national spotlight and set the stage for his future rise to political power.\n\nAfter his undergraduate studies concluded in 1975, Chávez entered active-duty military service. Chávez's first assignment was as commander of a communications platoon attached to a counter-insurgency force—the Manuel Cedeño Mountain Infantry Battalion, headquartered in Barinas and Cumaná. In 1976, it was tasked with suppressing a guerilla insurgency staged by the Hoxhaist Partido Bandera Roja (Red Flag Party). Despite this, Chávez saw little actual combat; this was due to a low density of insurgent activity in the Cumaná region. Later, in 1977, Chávez was appointed as a communications officer at the Center of Tactical Operations in San Mateo; it was here that Chávez first received first-hand and hands-on experience in counter-insurgency tactics. Chávez later recalled that, during these years, he experienced growing sympathy for the waning guerilla movements—the very groups he was tasked with countering. He harbored a growing dislike of what he viewed as corruption among the military hierarchy. He perceived such problems as a direct result of political corruption.\n\nAt the age of 23, Chávez married Nancy Colmenares. Colmenares, like Chávez, was also from Barinas and had roots in Venezuela's plains culture. Colmenares' friends gossiped that she was already pregnant with their first daughter before they were married in 1977. Thereafter, Chávez began to lead a \"double life\": while feigning disciplined obedience amidst his military superiors and miming political neutrality around his family, Chávez engaged in secret trysts with known socialists, communists, and other leftists.\n\nFrom 1978 through 1979, Chávez was commander and squad leader of the 414th Apure Braves AMX-30 armored battalion in Maracay. (The unit's anthem, Fatherland Beloved by Venezuelan composer Heriberto Maluenga, the then battalion military band conductor when he served with the battalion, was the one song he sang during his December 8, 2012 final TV address to the nation.) Chávez received promotions in rapid succession, and was eventually appointed company commander and head of the Department of Physical Education at the Military Academy of Venezuela, remaining in that position from 1980 to 1981. He then headed the Department of Culture at the Academy in 1982. Chávez was also a founding commander of the José Antonio Páez Company at the Academy from 1983 to 1984. At the time, Chávez gained recognition for his lectures at Caracas's war college, in which he spoke for hours in a \"folksy\" manner that captivated supporters in his audiences. Chávez's interest in Venezuelan politics only grew throughout his career in the military.\n\nChávez received several decorations: the Star of Carabobo (\"Estrella de Carabobo\"); the Land Forces Cross (\"Cruz de las Fuerzas Terrestres\"); and was awarded the Military Order of Francisco de Miranda, the Order of Rafael Urdaneta, and the Order of the Liberator, 5th Class (Military Division). Chávez continued playing baseball and softball: he went to the 1976 National Baseball Championships, held in Barinas; and he played in military baseball tournaments, among the most important of which were those held in Cumaná in 1977 and the Dominican Republic in 1980. Apart from his writing, Chávez sculpted, producing such works as the 1980 \"Sombra de Guerra en el Golfo\" (\"Shadows of War in the Gulf\").\n\nChávez's first attempt at launching a political movement came in 1977, when he formed the \"Ejército de Liberación del Pueblo de Venezuela\", or \"ELPV\"—the \"Liberation Army of the Venezuelan People\". Years later, he recalled that the \"ELPV\"'s purpose was to \"prepare ourselves in case something should happen\" and that it was \"an important pointer to the future\". In 1978, dressed in his army fatigues, Chávez met then-presidential candidate José Vicente Rangel—who later became Chávez's vice-president—and subsequently aided him in affixing election materials in Maracay. Chávez risked expulsion from the military had his superiors found out about such leftist political activities. Under Venezuelan law at the time, military officers and other personnel were forbidden from involving themselves in political affairs of any sort. Moreover, engaging in such illicit activities while dressed in fatigues or in uniform was punishable by even harsher penalties.\n\nIt was not until the period 1982–1983 that Chávez seriously began to plot the overthrow of Venezuela's elected civilian leaders. On 17 December 1982, Chávez and his co-conspirators gathered under a large tree at Samán de Güere. There, they solemnly witnessed each other's repetition of a revised version of the oath Simon Bolivar undertook while upon Italy's Monte Sacro, this time adding Ezequiel Zamora's slogan during the Federal War:\n\nOn 24 July 1983, Chávez—along with peers from his days at the military academy—launched the \"Ejército Revolucionario Bolivariano\" (\"EBR-200\"—\"Revolutionary Bolivarian Army\"). The \"200\" in \"EBR-200\"'s name derives from the movement's founding on the 200th anniversary of Simón Bolívar's birth. The movement established as its political goal the realization of \"Bolivarianism\" by means of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\". Chávez continued to play baseball in the military leagues. Indeed, he progressed with his team to the University League Championships, which were held in Caracas between 1984 and 1985. Chávez wrote collections of stories and poems, including \"Vuelvan Caras\", \"Mauricio\" and \"El Genio y el Centauro\" (\"The Genius and the Centaur\"). \"El Genio y el Centauro\" garnered him 3rd prize at a 1987 competition held in the \"Teatro Histórico Nacional\" (\"National Historical Theater\") in Cañafístola. One of his poems honored the late Felipe Acosta Carles, a co-founder of the \"EBR-200\".\n\nIn March 1986, the \"EBR-200\" held its third congress in San Cristobal, close to Venezuela's frontier with war-torn Colombia. The \"EBR-200\"'s inner circle came together for the secret meeting. Nine people attended, including six military personnel (including Chávez) and three civilians. Chávez's then-collaborator, Francisco Arias Cardenas (who, twelve years later, would lose the 2000 presidential election to Chávez) attended. Also in attendance was one of Chávez's uncles. Only one woman attended: Herma Marksman, who by then had become Chávez's mistress. Chávez's own wife and children remained alone in Sabaneta during these years. The attendees sought ways to attain power through a civilian-military power grab, a common method of power seizure in much of South and Latin America's history. Marksman played a crucial role in both Chávez's political and personal lives. Upfront, Chávez told Marksman that he would never marry her. Chávez stated that this stemmed from his mother's refusal to allow him to divorce Nancy. Nevertheless, he told Marksman that she was needed in his life. Thus, for nine years, Marksman would aid Chávez's plans by ferrying and delivering messages for him across the country. She performed various other tasks: placing phone calls and taking notes at meetings.\n\nLeaders of the extreme left movement \"La Causa R\"—such as founder Alfredo Maneira (just prior to his 1983 death) and leader Pablo Medina—held meetings with Chávez. Medina recounts that during their meetings Chávez always came across as a jovial person. This was despite recollections of his taciturn demeanor. Medina recalled that Chávez did not articulate his own opinions. Rather, he appeared as a \"sponge\" via his absorption of vast amounts of information. In this regard, Chávez always reportedly requested a hard copy of all documents he was shown. Nothing of substance came of these initial contacts. Chávez, then a lieutenant, was stationed as commander of a motorized army division—the Francisco Farfán Cavalry Unit—in remote Elorza, Apure between 1985 and 1986. Elorza itself was situated twelve hours due south (by local bus) from Barinas and towards the vast Venezuelan interior. The distance from his previous acquaintances (including his brother Adán and numerous leftist associates) meant that Chávez had much less opportunity to plan for his desired insurrection. By 1987, Chávez and Arias were seen by associates as the clear leaders of the \"EBR-200\". They together determined that it would be most opportune to launch their coup attempt halfway through the next president's term (they were not concerned about who won the presidential election). They reasoned that it was typically at mid-term that the President and his administration polled their lowest popularity levels.\n\nLater, Chávez commanded the Civilian-Military Development Nucleus at the Arauca-Meta border between 1986 and 1988. There, Chávez took advantage of his authority by implementing experimental civilian-military programs. In these programs, he organized such military aid efforts directed at the surrounding population as socioeconomic development initiatives, historical re-enactments and pageants, and oral history documentation efforts. Chávez was also in charge of all patron saints' feasts held in Elorza, Apure between 1987 and 1988. Chávez realized that such projects would be essential in order to effectively allow Latin America to regain an autonomous cultural identity independent of U.S. \"cultural imperialism\". Yet, in 1988, Chávez was seconded to the Miraflores presidential palace; there, he was appointed assistant head of the National Security and Defense Council by \"Accion Democratica\" President Jaime Lusinchi. The post would see Chávez sent off briefly to Central America on official business; he would remain at the post until 1989.\n\nThroughout Chávez's early life, Venezuela had enjoyed a period of economic and democratic stability that was remarkable in South America at the time. This stability was partly based on Venezuela's massive foreign exchange earnings gained from petroleum exports. Venezuelans referred to their society as \"Venezuela Saudíta\" (\"Saudi Venezuela\"—a parody of Saudi Arabia's heavily modernized and oil-based economy). When Saudi Arabia itself and other United States-aligned oil producers significantly raised their production output—in an attempt to bring about economic implosion in the heavily oil-dependent Soviet Union—a global oil glut ensued. Oil prices collapsed to historic lows, and Venezuelan oil earnings, and economic and social stability in general, were suddenly imperiled: in the 1980s, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell by more than 20%, and by 1989 real wages fell to a third of their previous levels. The nation also faced a dire balance of payments crisis.\n\nResponding to this, in 1989 the Carlos Andrés Pérez administration enacted sweeping and ambitious IMF-inspired neoliberal structural adjustment programs. Nevertheless, these reforms were widely unpopular among poor and working class Venezuelans. Such measures involved the removal of state-managed development and industrialization, the implementation of market liberalization measures, enactment of export subsidies and incentives, extensive privatization of state-owned holdings, curtailed social spending, the release of longstanding price controls on many goods, as well as liberalization of capital and liquidity flows into and out of Venezuela. The programs' international backers—including renowned Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs—as well as domestic business groups such as \"Grupo Roraima\" thereby sought to restore fiscal stability and responsibility to Venezuela's ailing economy. These policies yielded mixed social and economic results. In 1991 and 1992, Venezuela experienced GDP growth rates of 10.3% and 7%, respectively. Such remarkable results resulted mainly from Pérez's drive to increase investments in the oil industry.\n\nYet, other indicators suffered. Sharp declines in measures of human well-being exacerbated a growing social crisis. Much hardship was thus generated among Venezuela's poor majority. Incidences of hunger, prostitution, murder, and other ills rose sharply, while continuing surges in Venezuela's national debt and flagging foreign direct investment inflows continued to hammer the Venezuelan economy. Further, the neoliberal reforms failed to lower high poverty rates of the 1990s. This continuing poverty complimented Latin American economies' general skewing towards satiating elite consumptive interests while simultaneously relieving upper classes from substantial taxes that would subsidize the poor.\n\nDiscontent with the general socioeconomic decline erupted in the violent 27 February 1989 Caracazo riots; they were the most destructive and deadly such disturbances in Venezuelan history. Officially, 372 deaths occurred—although some critics of the government claim that the actual total is well in excess of two thousand. Outraged mobs engaged in mass arson against whole city blocks. Several days passed before troops restored full order. At the time, Chávez was ill. Thus, he was not ordered to help suppress the riots that were breaking out in primarily poor neighborhoods. Yet, Chávez recalls observing the unfolding events—and realizing that he had missed his \"strategic minute\" to launch his coup. Thus unable for the moment to capitalize on the popular anger and unrest, Chávez refined his critique of what he saw as an irredeemably corrupt traditional two-party \"puntofijismo\" system. Subsequently, Chávez's political rhetoric would dramatically mature; after these \"Caracazo\" riots, Chávez always chose to refer to the type of neoliberalism practiced by Pérez as so-called \"savage\" neoliberalism. He saw such economic reform packages—including the ten-point \"Washington Consensus\" reform program advanced by former International Monetary Fund advisor John Williamson—as forcibly imposed upon the unwilling populations of Latin America by the U.S. government and allied leaders. In response, Chávez intensified preparations for the Bolivarian military-civilian coup.\n\nWeeks after the \"Caracazo\", Chávez returned to work at Miraflores. Chávez recalled that the presidential palace's guards stopped and questioned him. They reportedly asked him: \"[l]ook here, major, is it true about the Bolivarian Movement? We'd like to hear more about it; we're not prepared to go on killing people\". Chávez took this as a sign that his plan to overthrow the government was gaining momentum. By late 1989, the first civilians joined the EBR-200's ranks. The EBR-200 thus changed its name to the \"Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario-200\" (MBR-200—the \"Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200\"). The supplanting of the word \"Army\" (\"Ejército\") with \"Movement\" (\"Movimiento\") was intended to punctuate this shift. However, on 6 December 1989, Chávez along with other senior officers were abruptly arrested. They were brought before army command on charges of plotting a coup that was suspected by the government as planned for Christmas Day. They were accused of planning the assassination of high government officials, including President Pérez. Yet the officers were eventually released—due to lack of evidence. The government was reluctant to prosecute officers who were recognized in the military as among the best in their respective armed services. Nevertheless, all—including Chávez—were thereafter sent to posts far from the federal government in Caracas. Chávez was sent in 1990 to Maturín, where he was appointed the official in charge of civilian matters with the Ranger Brigade headquartered in the area. Chávez was later allowed to matriculate at the Universidad Simón Bolívar (\"Simón Bolívar University\") in Caracas, where he did graduate work in political science. He left without a degree. Chávez took courses until August 1991.\n\nChávez re-entered military service with an initial re-posting to Cumaná, where a desk job awaited him. Chávez recalled feeling that such a seemingly dull and minor posting was beneath him. Thereafter, from 1991 to 4 February 1992, Chávez was again given his own command—the Maracay-based Colonel Antonio Nicolas Briceño 421st Airborne Battalion, 42nd Airborne Brigade, of the Venezuelan Army's 4th Armored Division (then the 4th Infantry Division). Such troops proved key in facilitating Chávez's violent political ambitions. Chávez received the job when the battalion's former commander retired from the army; Chávez was his replacement as commanding offivcer. With a posting in Maracay, a city that is relatively near the national power structures in Caracas, Chávez's coup plans were no longer hindered by his own geographic isolation. Later, reports emerged of a dossier detailing all of Chávez's subversive activities. It had been produced just prior to Chávez's new Maracay posting—yet, the document was ignored by military intelligence. The major who had compiled it was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation.\n\nBy 1991, Chávez and other MBR-200 leaders activated the coup plan codenamed after one of Chávez's heroes, Ezequiel Zamora—\"Plan Zamora\". Yet despite planning \"for\" the coup's execution, Chávez and other MBR-200 leaders made precious little plans about what their putative future rebel government would do \"after\" the rebellion. Their future governing structure thus remained vague until the end of 1991, when Chávez and others decided to delineate an initial legal framework for their government's operation. Several assorted coup dates were proposed by Chávez's associates. Indeed, many junior captains threatened to launch their own early coup, which would be independent of that waged by their higher ranked commanders. They threatened this action if Chávez refused to pick a date that they considered soon enough. Yet Chávez refused to budge on a December 1991 attempt. He stated that nothing was to be attempted without his involvement. The captains thus waited for Chávez's chosen date. Yet one aspect of the planned coup remained clear throughout: Chávez's demand that it maintain a primarily military focus and character. The leftist ex-guerrilla leader Douglas Bravo—who fought in the 1960s and 1970s—also regularly met Chávez. These meetings took place during the years leading up to the coup and without the knowledge of other key MBR-200 officers. Bravo recounted that Chávez did not trust civilians enough to afford them a role in his bloody intrigue. According to him, it was for this reason that what was initially planned as a civilian-military rebellion was pared down by Chávez to one fought solely by soldiers; Bravo and his leftist civilian cohorts were turfed out of logistical considerations, preparations, and planning just days before the coup.\n\nYet, towards the end of January 1992, Chávez realized that the Movement's window of opportunity was to close. Chávez received notification that he faced imminent transferral on 14 February—to a small village on the frontier with war-ravaged Colombia. Chávez realized that this posting would jeopardize his participation in the MBR-200 coup, as the town was far from the major cities and power centers of Venezuela's northern coastal strip. Alarmed at this prospect, Chávez and other Movement members held one final meeting. There, they determined to act before Chávez's transfer. They would quicken preparations and wait until President Pérez—who was just then abroad on a trip to the 1992 World Economic Forum, held in Switzerland—returned to Venezuela. All the while, MBR-200 rebel forces built up their numbers. Eventually, 5 lieutenant colonels, 14 majors, 54 captains, 67 first and second lieutenants, 65 warrant officers and technical non-commissioned personnel, 101 sergeants and senior non-commissioned officers and 2,056 corporals and enlisted servicemen were involved in the conspiracy; thus Chávez and other rebel commanders had 2,367 military personnel from 10 army battalions to rely upon. They set a final date for their coup: Tuesday, 4 February 1992.\n\n"}

He attended Washington State University, where he received degrees in chemistry and physics, and the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), where he earned his PhD in nuclear physics. As a young physicist, he worked for Ernest Lawrence at the UC Berkeley. He was among the first American scientists to verify nuclear fission in an article submitted to the Physical Review in February 1939. From 1939 until 1941, he worked as an assistant physicist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. It was while he was here that he worked on a substance that emitted beta rays and was produced by irradiation of uranium with neutrons. After he collaborated with the Nobel Prize laureate Luis Alvarez they isolated the material, and became the co-discoverer of neptunium on 8 June 1940 with Edwin McMillan. McMillan was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery among other elements.\n\nAbelson was a key contributor to the Manhattan Project during World War II, while working with the Naval Research Laboratory. Although he was not formally associated with the atom bomb project, the liquid thermal diffusion isotope separation technique that he invented at the Philadelphia Navy Yard was used in the S-50 plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and proved a critical step in creating the large amount of nuclear fuel required for building atomic bombs.\n\nAfter the war, he turned his attention under the guidance of Ross Gunn to applying nuclear power to naval propulsion. While not written at an engineering-design level, he wrote the first physics report detailing how a nuclear reactor could be installed in a submarine, providing both propulsion and electrical power. His report anticipated the nuclear submarine's role as a missile platform. This concept was later supported by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and others. Under Rickover, the concept became reality in the form of , the world's first nuclear submarine.\n\nIn 1946, he returned to work at the Carnegie Institution, which published his report “Atomic Energy Submarine,” in March of that year. From 1953 until 1971 he served as the director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory, and as president from 1971 to 1978, and as a trustee from 1978 on. From 1962 to 1984 he was editor of \"Science\", one of the most prestigious academic journals, and served as its acting executive officer in 1974, 1975 and 1984. From 1972 until 1974 he served as the president of the American Geophysical Union.\n\nAbelson was outspoken and well known for his opinions on science. In a 1964 editorial published in \"Science\" magazine, Abelson identified overspecialization in science as a form of bigotry. He outlined his view that the pressure towards specialization beginning in undergraduate study and intensifying in PhD programs leads students to believe that their area of specialization is the most important, even to the extreme view that other intellectual pursuits are worthless. He reasoned that such overspecialization led to obsolescence of one's work, often through a focus on trivial aspects of a field, and that avoidance of such bigotry was essential to guiding the direction of one's work.\n\nIn a 1965 article he described his work in paleobiology and reported evidence of amino acids recovered from fossils hundreds of millions of years in age and fatty acids in rocks dating over a billion years old. He estimated that based on his experiments alanine would be stable for billions of years.\nPerhaps his most famous work from this time period is an editorial entitled \"Enough of Pessimism\" (\"enough of pessimism, it only leads to paralysis and decay\"). This became the title of a 100 essay collection.\n\nDuring the 1970s he became interested in the problem of world energy supplies. Books on the topic include \"Energy for Tomorrow\" (1975), from a series of lectures at the University of Washington, and \"Energy II: Use Conservation and Supply\". He pointed out the possibilities of mining the Athabascan tar sands, as well as oil shale in the Colorado Rockies. In addition he urged conservation and a change of attitude towards public transit.\n\nAfter 1984, he remained associated with the magazine. Some have claimed him to be an early skeptic of the case for global warming on the basis of a lead editorial in the magazine dated March 31, 1990, in which he wrote, \"[I]f the global warming situation is analyzed applying the customary standards of scientific inquiry one must conclude that there has been more hype than solid fact.\" However, this contrasts what is said in a US National Research Council, Energy and Environment report on which his name appears along with Thomas F. Malone over a decade earlier in 1977:\n\nAbelson died on August 1, 2004, from respiratory complications following a brief illness. He was married to Neva Abelson, a distinguished research physician who co-discovered the Rh blood factor test (with L. K. Diamond). Their daughter, Ellen Abelson Cherniavsky, worked as an aviation researcher for the MITRE corporation in Virginia.\n\nAbelson received many distinguished awards, including the National Medal of Science in 1987, the National Science Foundation's Distinguished Achievement Award, the American Medical Association's Scientific Achievement Award, the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Medal and the Waldo E. Smith Medal in 1988. In 1992 he was awarded the Public Welfare Medal, the National Academy of Sciences's highest honor. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.\n\nThe mineral abelsonite is named after Abelson in recognition of his contribution to organic geochemistry.\n\nThe Philip and Neva Abelson Hall at Washington State University was named in his honor.\n\n\n\n"}

He created curricula and taught courses for Simon Fraser University, MacDonald Dettwiler, and the University of Phoenix. Slade creates seminars for local, federal and international training groups. He is a senior instructor for (ISC)² where he develops courses in information security and quality assurance (QA) for those who seek certification. Slade himself is one of the world's approximately 60,000 CISSPs, a certification used in private industry as well as, at least in the United States, in government and defense.\n\nSlade moved his online security glossary in 2006 to the book \"Dictionary of Information Security\". \"Virus Bulletin\" remarked about the unusual collection of five forewords, \"that so many acknowledged experts are willing to contribute says something about the author's standing in the field\"—the forewords were written by Fred Cohen, Jack Holleran, Peter G. Neumann, Harold Tipton and Gene Spafford. The dictionary is considered to be \"dependable baseline definitions\" and a \"citable, common source\".\n\nSlade has \"surveyed most of the literature\" in his field and shared his knowledge in the \"Internet Review Project\", the published book reviews for which he is perhaps most widely known. He reviews other works but gave first priority to information security. His reviews are often critical—to the project FAQ question, \"Don't you like \"any\" books?\", Slade replied that he may be cruel but is fair.\n\n\n"}

An early engineer of the \"Vital Signs\", he formed \"Junoon\" (lit. Obsession) in 1990 with American bassist Brian O'Connell and pioneered the Sufi influenced rock music in Pakistan. He started his activism in the mid-1990s and has been involved in two BBC documentaries concerning the issues in Pakistan such as society, education, religion and science.\n\nHe has served as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/AIDS Programme towards spreading awareness about HIV in South Asia. While working with the Pakistan's media to help initiate peace between India and Pakistan, Ahmad continues to produce documentaries and solo guitar albums. At present, he is serving tenured professor at the Queens College of the City University of New York although, with Junoon being disintegrated, Salman Ahmad continues to perform as a solo artist under the \"Junoon\" label and has moved to New York and released one album as a solo artist, \"Infiniti\" in 2005.\n\nSalman Ahmad spent his childhood in Pakistan, before moving to New York when his father got a job in the airline industry. Ahmad then attended middle and high school in the United States, where he was first exposed to rock music at a Led Zeppelin concert at Madison Square Garden. Motivated to become a musician, he began learning the guitar against his parents wishes. After graduation, he returned to Pakistan in order to attend medical school. However, due to vast changes in the political climate and the advent of extremism, Ahmad's guitar playing was repressed. He took action by playing at covert talent shows, unfazed by criticism and even death threats from extremists. These underground performances and the consequent censorship set the stage for him to become a peace advocate and eventually found the bands Junoon and Vital Signs\n\nHe has been teaching a class on music titled \"Islamic Music and Culture of South Asia\", as a guest faculty at Queens College. This year, he started his second semester as a guest faculty.\nOn 1 March 2008, Ahmad performed with Yale Strom (a world leading Klezmer artist) at Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn Heights as part of another \"Common Chords II\" concert celebrating Muslim and Jewish Music. Together with Strom, Ahmad leads the multi-faith ensemble Common Chords, whose members include Chatterjee, dhol player Sunny Jain, bassist Mark Dresser, vocalist Elizabeth Schwartz and others. In 2016, his new song \"Kaise Bolun\" from an upcoming Bollywood movie \"Rhythm\" starring Adeel Chaudhry has received enormous negative feedback from his fans on social media through showing their discomfort over song's music and video. According to people, they never expected such kind of music from legendary Salman Ahmad.\n\nAhmad and his band Junoon suffered political censorship in Pakistan during the administration of Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, partly due to a song denouncing political corruption. In 1998 during the administration of Nawaz Sharif, Junoon was again banned in Pakistan, because they protested against the nuclear power tests in India as well as their own country by saying, \"Why escalate the arms race when people still need water? Why see our neighbors as enemies when we are so close to each other?\"\n\nAhmad played at the Roskilde Festival in 2000 under the banner of Freemuse, just a couple of years after the ban. As a musician who faced censorship in his home country, Ahmad says that \"there is no conflict between my faith and my music, you can be a Muslim and play electric guitar\".\n\nIn 2006, during a Freemuse conference in Beirut he was part of one of the rare occasions where music and religion was taken seriously and where discussions on music and Islam focused on theology and not just social and cultural patterns. About this he said, \"I've taken part in Freemuse dialogue meetings and press meetings. They have always been great meetings places for musicians, researchers and journalists and I've always felt that understanding the motivations behind and the mechanisms of censorship have been in focus – not just condemning censorship. Having said that, we, the artists, should always be ready to defend our colleagues when the rights to freedom of expression are attacked, and thus we need an organisation such as Freemuse to help us do this.\"\n\nTelevised in around 100 countries, Ahmad and his band Junoon performed with artists from all over the world at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, on 11 December 2007. He also played at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony on 9 December 2007, where he was joined by tabla virtuoso Pandit Samir Chatterjee.\n\nSalman Ahmad published an autobiographical work titled \"\" in January 2010. The book was published by Simon & Schuster. Melissa Etheridge wrote the following in the introduction:\n\nIn 2009, Ahmad and his wife Samina were involved in raising money for Swat IDPs.\n\nAhmad has acted in television dramas.\n\nThe HBO documentary \"Open Your Eyes\" features the original song \"Open Your Eyes\", composed by Salman Ahmad with vocals from Peter Gabriel.\n\nSalman Ahmad has been often seen at Pakistan Tehreek e Insaaf's (Pakistan Justice Party) rallies which is founded by cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan. Salman Ahmad sings patriotic and revolutionary songs in these rallies which revitalises the whole environment, he is often alleged as being a member of the party as well.\nIn October 2016, Salman Ahmad was taken into custody by Islamabad police along with various other Pakistan Tehreek e Insaaf's workers after the activists clashed with the law enforcement entities in Rawalpindi.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "98970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98970", "title": "Shoko Asahara", "text": "Shoko Asahara\n\n, born , was the founder of the Japanese doomsday-cult group Aum Shinrikyo. Asahara was convicted of masterminding the deadly 1995 sarin-gas attack on the Tokyo subway, and was also involved in several other crimes. He was sentenced to death in 2004. In June 2012, his execution was postponed due to further arrests of Aum Shinrikyo members. He was executed by hanging on July 6, 2018.\n\nAsahara was born on March 2, 1955 into a large, poor family of tatami-mat-makers in Japan's Kumamoto Prefecture. He had infantile glaucoma from birth, which made him lose all sight in his left eye and go partially blind in his right eye at a young age, and was thus enrolled in a school for the blind. Asahara was known to be a bully at the school, taking advantage of the other students by beating them and extorting money from them. He graduated in 1977 and turned to the study of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, which were common careers for the blind in Japan. He married the following year and eventually fathered 12 children, the eldest of whom was born in 1978.\n\nIn 1981, Asahara was convicted of practicing pharmacy without a license and selling unregulated drugs, for which he was fined . \n\nAsahara's interest in religion reportedly started at this time. Having been recently married, he worked to support his large and growing family. He dedicated his free time to the study of various religious concepts, starting with Chinese astrology and Taoism. \n\nLater, Asahara practiced western esotericism, yoga, meditation, esoteric Buddhism, and esoteric Christianity.\n\nIn 1984, Asahara formed Aum Shinsen no Kai. He changed his name from Chizuo Matsumoto to Shoko Asahara and renamed his group Aum Shinrikyo in 1987. Asahara applied for government registration and, although authorities were initially reluctant, after an appeal, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government eventually granted it legal recognition as a religious corporation in 1989. \n\nAfter this, a monastic order was established, and many lay followers joined. Asahara gained credibility by appearing on TV and on magazine covers. He gradually attained a following of believers and began being invited to lecture-meeting at universities. Asahara also wrote several religious books, including \"Beyond Life and Death\", \"Declaring Myself the Christ\", and \"Supreme Initiation\".\n\nThe doctrine of Aum Shinrikyo is based on the Vajrayana scriptures, the Bible, and other texts. In 1992 Asahara published \"Declaring Myself the Christ\", within which he declared himself \"Christ\", Japan's only fully enlightened master, and identified with the \"Lamb of God\". \n\nHis purported mission was to take others' sins upon himself, and he claimed he could transfer spiritual power to his followers. He saw dark conspiracies everywhere, promulgated by the Jews, the Freemasons, the Dutch, the British Royal Family, and rival Japanese religions. \n\nHe outlined a doomsday prophecy, which included a third World War, and described a final conflict culminating in a nuclear \"Armageddon\", borrowing the term from the Book of Revelation .\n\nAsahara often preached the necessity of Armageddon for \"human relief\". He eventually declared, \"Put tantra Vajrayana into practice in accordance with the doctrines of Mahamudra,\" and he led a series of terrorist attacks using a secret organization hidden from ordinary believers.\n\nOn March 20, 1995, members of Aum Shinrikyo attacked the Tokyo subway with the nerve gas sarin. Thirteen people died and thousands more suffered ill effects. After finding sufficient evidence, authorities accused Aum Shinrikyo of complicity in the attack, as well as in a number of smaller-scale incidents. Dozens of disciples were arrested, Aum's facilities were raided, and the court issued an order for Asahara's arrest.\n\nOn May 16, 1995, the police investigated the headquarters of Aum Shinrikyo. Asahara was discovered in a very small, isolated room in one of the facilities. \n\nWary of possible Aum military power, the First Airborne Brigade of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force was stationed nearby to support the police if needed.\n\nAsahara faced 27 counts of murder in 13 separate indictments. The prosecution argued that Asahara gave orders to attack the Tokyo Subway in order to \"overthrow the government and install himself in the position of Emperor of Japan\". \n\nLater, during the trial which took more than seven years to conclude, the prosecution forwarded an additional theory that the attacks were ordered to divert police attention away from Aum. The prosecution also accused Asahara of masterminding the Matsumoto incident and the Sakamoto family murder. According to Asahara's defense team, a group of senior followers initiated the atrocities and kept them a secret from Asahara.\n\nDuring the trials, some of the disciples testified against Asahara, and he was found guilty on 13 of 17 charges, including the Sakamoto family murder; four charges were dropped. On February 27, 2004, he was sentenced to death by hanging. The trial was called the \"trial of the century\" by the Japanese media. Meanwhile, Asahara resigned from his position as the Aum Shinrikyo representative in an attempt to prevent the group from being forcefully dissolved by the state.\n\nThe defense appealed Asahara's sentencing on the grounds that he was mentally unfit, and psychiatric examinations were undertaken. During much of the trials, Asahara remained silent or only muttered to himself. However, he communicated with the staff at his detention facility, which convinced the examiner that Asahara was maintaining his silence out of free will. Owing to his lawyers' failure to submit the statement of reason for appeal, the Tokyo High Court decided on March 27, 2006, not to grant them leave to appeal. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of Japan on September 15, 2006. \n\nTwo re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court. In June 2012, Asahara's execution was postponed due to arrests of several fugitive Aum Shinrikyo members.\n\nAsahara was executed by hanging on July 6, 2018, at the Tokyo Detention House, 23 years after the sarin gas attack, along with six other cult members. Relatives of victims said they approved of the execution.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1200064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1200064", "title": "Tara (Buddhism)", "text": "Tara (Buddhism)\n\nTara (, ; Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ, Dölma), Ārya Tārā, or White Tara, also known as Jetsun Dölma (Tibetan language: \"rje btsun sgrol ma\") in Tibetan Buddhism, is an important figure in Buddhism. She appears as a female bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism, and as a female Buddha in Vajrayana Buddhism. She is known as the \"mother of liberation\", and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements. She is known as \"Tara Bosatsu\" (多羅菩薩) in Japan, and occasionally as \"Duōluó Púsà\" (多羅菩薩) in Chinese Buddhism.\n\nTārā is a meditation deity worshiped by practitioners of the Tibetan branch of Vajrayana Buddhism to develop certain inner qualities and to understand outer, inner and secret teachings such as karuṇā (compassion), mettā (loving-kindness), and shunyata (emptiness). Tārā may more properly be understood as different aspects of the same quality, as bodhisattvas are often considered metaphors for Buddhist virtues.\n\nThere is also recognition in some schools of Buddhism of \"twenty-one Tārās\". A practice text entitled \"Praises to the Twenty-One Taras\", is the most important text on Tara in Tibetan Buddhism. Another key text is the \"Tantra Which is the Source for All the Functions of Tara, Mother of All the Tathagatas\". \n\nThe main Tārā mantra is the same for Buddhists and Hindus alike: . It is pronounced by Tibetans and Buddhists who follow the Tibetan traditions as . The literal translation would be “Oṃ O Tārā, I pray O Tārā, O Swift One, So Be It!.”\n\nWithin Tibetan Buddhism Tārā is regarded as a bodhisattva of compassion and action. She is the female aspect of Avalokiteśvara and in some origin stories she comes from his tears:\n\n\"Then at last Avalokiteshvara arrived at the summit of Marpori, the 'Red Hill', in Lhasa. Gazing out, he perceived that the lake on Otang, the 'Plain of Milk', resembled the Hell of Ceaseless Torment. Myriad beings were undergoing the agonies of boiling, burning, hunger, thirst, yet they never perished, sending forth hideous cries of anguish all the while. When Avalokiteshvara saw this, tears sprang to his eyes. A teardrop from his right eye fell to the plain and became the reverend Bhrikuti, who declared: \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavour!\" Bhrikuti was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's right eye, and was reborn in a later life as the Nepalese princess Tritsun. A teardrop from his left eye fell upon the plain and became the reverend Tara. She also declared, \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavor!\" Tārā was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's left eye.\"\n\nTārā manifests in many different forms. In Tibet, these forms included White Tārā's manifestation as the Nepalese Princess (Bhrikuti), and Green Tārā's manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo (Princess Wencheng).\n\nTārā is also known as a saviouress, as a heavenly deity who hears the cries of beings experiencing misery in saṃsāra.\n\nWhether the Tārā figure originated as a Buddhist or Hindu goddess is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars. Mallar Ghosh believes her to have originated as a form of the goddess Durga in the Hindu Puranas. Today, she is worshiped both in Buddhism and in Shaktism as one of the ten Mahavidyas. It may be true that goddesses entered Buddhism from Shaktism (i.e. the worship of local or folk goddesses prior to the more institutionalized Hinduism which had developed by the early medieval period (i.e. Middle kingdoms of India). Possibly the oldest text to mention a Buddhist goddess is the \"Prajnaparamita Sutra\" (translated into Chinese from the original Sanskrit c. 2nd century CE), around the time that Mahayana was becoming the dominant school of thought in Indian and Chinese Buddhism. Thus, it would seem that the feminine principle makes its first appearance in Buddhism as the goddess who personified prajnaparamita.\n\nTārā came to be seen as an expression of the compassion of perfected wisdom only later, with her earliest textual reference being the \"Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa\" (c. 5th–8th centuries CE). The earliest, solidly identifiable image of Tārā is most likely that which is still found today at cave 6 within the rock-cut Buddhist monastic complex of the Ellora Caves in Maharashtra (c. 7th century CE), with her worship being well established by the onset of the Pala Empire in Eastern India (8th century CE).\n\nTārā became a very popular Vajrayana deity with the rise of Tantra in 8th-century Pala and, with the movement of Indian Buddhism into Tibet through Padmasambhava, the worship and practices of Tārā became incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as well. She eventually came to be considered the \"Mother of all Buddhas,\" which usually refers to the enlightened wisdom of the Buddhas, while simultaneously echoing the ancient concept of the Mother Goddess in India.\n\nIndependent of whether she is classified as a deity, a Buddha, or a bodhisattva, Tārā remains very popular in Tibet (and Tibetan communities in exile in Northern India), Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, and is worshiped in a majority of Buddhist communities throughout the world (see also Guanyin, the female aspect of Avalokitesvara in Chinese Buddhism).\n\nToday, Green Tara and White Tara are probably the most popular representations of Tara. Green Tara (\"Khadiravani\") is usually associated with protection from fear and the following eight obs-curation: lions (= pride), wild elephants (= delusion/ignorance), fires (= hatred and anger), snakes (= jealousy), bandits and thieves (= wrong views, including fanatical views), bondage (= avarice and miserliness), floods (= desire and attachment), and evil spirits and demons (= deluded doubts). As one of the three deities of long life, White Tara (\"Saraswati\") is associated with longevity. White Tara counteracts illness and thereby helps to bring about a long life. She embodies the motivation that is compassion and is said to be as white and radiant as the moon.\n\nTārā has many stories told which explain her origin as a bodhisattva. \nIn this tale there is a young princess who lives in a different world system, millions of years in the past. Her name is Yeshe Dawa, which means \"Moon of Primordial Awareness\". For quite a number of aeons she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning bodhicitta - the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further. At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only \"weak minded worldlings\" who see gender as a barrier to attaining enlightenment. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until samsara is no more. She then stays in a palace in a state of meditation for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme bodhi as the Goddess Tārā in many world systems to come.\n\nWith this story in mind, it is interesting to juxtapose this with a quotation from the 14th Dalai Lama about Tārā, spoken at a conference on Compassionate Action in Newport Beach, CA in 1989:\n\nThere is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess Tārā. Following her cultivation of bodhicitta, the bodhisattva's motivation, she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and she felt that there were too few people who attained Buddhahood as women. So she vowed, \"I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all my lifetimes along the path I vow to be born as a woman, and in my final lifetime when I attain Buddhahood, then, too, I will be a woman.\"\n\nTārā, then, embodies certain ideals which make her attractive to women practitioners, and her emergence as a Bodhisattva can be seen as a part of Mahayana Buddhism's reaching out to women, and becoming more inclusive even in 6th-century CE India.\n\nTārā's name literally means \"star\" or \"planet\", and therefore she is associated with navigation and travel both literally and metaphorically as spiritual crossing to the 'other side' of the ocean of existence (enlightenment). Hence she is known literally as \"she who saves\" in Tibetan. In the \"108 Names of the Holy Tara\", Tara is 'Leader of the caravans ... who showeth the way to those who have lost it' and she is named as \"Dhruva\", the Sanskrit name for the North Star.\n\nAccording to Miranda Shaw, \"Motherhood is central to the conception of Tara\". Her titles include \"loving mother\", \"supreme mother\", \"mother of the world\", \"universal mother\" and \"mother of all Buddhas\".\n\nShe is most often shown with the blue lotus or night lotus (\"utpala\"), which releases its fragrance with the appearance of the moon and therefore Tārā is also associated with the moon and night. \n\nTārā is also a forest goddess, particularly in her form as \"Khadiravani\", \"dweller in the Khadira forest\" and is generally associated with plant life, flowers, acacia (khadira) trees and the wind. Because of her association with nature and plants, Tārā is also known as a healing goddess (especially as White Tārā) and as a goddess of nurturing quality and fertility. Her pure land in Mount Potala is described as \"Covered with manifold trees and creepers, resounding with the sound of many birds, And with murmur of waterfalls, thronged with wild beasts of many kinds; Many species of flowers grow everywhere.\" Her association with the wind element (vaayu) also means that she is swift in responding to calls for any aid.\n\nTārā also embodies many of the qualities of feminine principle. She is known as the Mother of Mercy and Compassion. She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children. As Green Tārā she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter within the samsaric world. As White Tārā she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. As Red Tārā she teaches discriminating awareness about created phenomena, and how to turn raw desire into compassion and love. As Blue Tārā (Ekajati) she becomes a protector in the Nyingma lineage, who expresses a ferocious, wrathful, female energy whose invocation destroys all Dharmic obstacles and engenders good luck and swift spiritual awakening.\n\nWithin Tibetan Buddhism, she has 21 major forms in all, each tied to a certain color and energy. And each offers some feminine attribute, of ultimate benefit to the spiritual aspirant who asks for her assistance.\n\nAnother quality of feminine principle which she shares with the dakinis is playfulness. As John Blofeld expands upon in \"Bodhisattva of Compassion\", Tārā is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of dharma practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In \"Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis\", Thinley Norbu explores this as \"Playmind\". Applied to Tārā one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development.\n\nThese qualities of feminine principle then, found an expression in Indian Mahayana Buddhism and the emerging Vajrayana of Tibet, as the many forms of Tārā, as dakinis, as Prajnaparamita, and as many other local and specialized feminine divinities. As the worship of Tārā developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose and set down sadhanas, or tantric meditation practices. Two ways of approach to her began to emerge. In one common folk and lay practitioners would simply directly appeal to her to ease some of the travails of worldly life. In the second, she became a Tantric deity whose practice would be used by monks or tantric yogis in order to develop her qualities in themselves, ultimately leading through her to the source of her qualities, which are Enlightenment, Enlightened Compassion, and Enlightened Mind.\n\nTārā as a focus for tantric deity yoga can be traced back to the time period of Padmasambhava. There is a Red Tārā practice which was given by Padmasambhava to Yeshe Tsogyal. He asked that she hide it as a treasure. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as Sakya Trizin, present head of the Sakyapa sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, who released it to his western students.\n\nMartin Willson in \"In Praise of Tārā\" traces many different lineages of Tārā Tantras, that is Tārā scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas. For example, a Tārā sadhana was revealed to Tilopa (988–1069 CE), the human father of the Karma Kagyu. Atisa, the great translator and founder of the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of Tārā. He composed a praise to her, and three Tārā Sadhanas. Martin Willson's work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that Tārā as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day.\n\nThe practices themselves usually present Tārā as a tutelary deity (thug dam, yidam) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one's mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from Buddha Jnana. As John Blofeld puts it in \"The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet\":\n\nThere are many forms of Tārā, including various popular lists of 21 different emanations of Tārā. Green Tārā, (śyāmatārā) associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity is the most depicted and the central aspect of Tārā from which others such as the 21 Tārās emanate. In her Green form, she is often also known as Khadiravaṇi-Tārā (Tārā of the acacia forest), who appeared to Nagarjuna in the Khadiravani forest of South India and protects from the eight great fears. She is often accompanied by her two attendants Mārīcī and Ekajaṭā. Dharmachari Purna writes on the various forms of Tara:\n\nTārā is in fact the name of a whole class of deities. She appears in all the five colours of the Jinas. There are at least ten green forms, seven white, five yellow, two blue and one red. As Sarvajñamitra says of her form: 'It is a universal form, varied like crystal, since it changes according to circumstance'.She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her figure is shown in virtually all postures from standing to sitting, full lotus, half lotus, one leg down, and both legs down. There is apparently also a reclining Tārā. She has two-armed forms, four arms, eight arms, twelve arms, and Getty even mentions a Tibetan painting showing a standing Tārā with 'one thousand heads and arms'. Ghosh lists seventy-six distinct forms of Tārā, and tradition tells us there are one hundred and eight names for her.\n\nAccording to Sarvajnamitra she has a “universal form” (\"visva-rupa\"), that encompasses all living beings and deities, and which changes with the needs of each being.\n\nOther forms of Tārā include:\n\n\nTārā's iconography such as the lotus also shows resemblance with the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, and at least one Tibetan liturgy evokes Lakshmi as Tārā. According to Miranda Shaw, there is a later trend of Tārā theology that began to see all other female divinities as aspects of Tārā or at least associated with her. Apart from her many emanations named Tārā of varying colors, other Mahayana female divinities that became part of Tara's theology include Janguli, Parnasabari, Cunda, Kurukulla, Mahamayuri, Usnisavijaya, and Marici. Based on this principle of Tārā as the central female divinity, Dakinis were also seen as emanations of her.\n\nSadhanas in which Tārā is the yidam (meditational deity) can be extensive or quite brief. Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her mantra is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the Tārā sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of Vajrayana Buddhism, however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism. Two examples are Zabtik Drolchok and Chime Pakme Nyingtik.\n\nIn this case during the creation phase of Tārā as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as Tārā. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the yidam and also the emptiness of one's ordinary self.\n\nThis occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the \"self\" is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one's self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of Emptiness and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking Tārā's energy through its Sanskrit seed syllables and this purifies and activates certain psychic centers of the body (chakras). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization.\n\nTherefore, even in a simple Tārā sadhana a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as \"Deity Yoga\", compiled by the present Dalai Lama, which explores all the ramifications of working with a yidam in Tantric practices.\n\nThe end results of doing such Tārā practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of kleshas, and other obstacles and obscurations.\n\nThe mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels (nadis) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing Tārā's perfected form one acknowledges one's own perfected form, that is one's intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic phenomena as being inherently real and permanent.\n\nThe practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one's inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self.\n\nAs Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, in his \"Introduction to the Red Tārā Sadhana\", notes of his lineage: \"Tārā is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, Tārā meditation is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion\".\n\nThere are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as \"internal\" and \"external\". Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration.\n\nThe preparations are of two types: external and internal. The external preparations consist of cleaning the meditation room, setting up a shrine with images of Buddha Shakyamuni and Green Tara, and setting out a beautiful arrangement of offerings. We can use water to represent nectar for drinking, water for bathing the feet, and perfume. For the remaining offerings—flowers, incense, light, and pure food—if possible we should set out the actual substances. As for internal preparations, we should try to improve our compassion, bodhichitta, and correct view of emptiness through the practice of the stages of the path, and to receive a Tantric empowerment of Green Tara. It is possible to participate in group pujas if we have not yet received an empowerment, but to gain deep experience of this practice we need to receive an empowerment. The main internal preparation is to generate and strengthen our faith in Arya Tara, regarding her as the synthesis of all Gurus, Yidams, and Buddhas.\n\nTerma teachings are \"hidden teachings\" said to have been left by Padmasambhava (8th century) and others for the benefit of future generations. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo discovered Phagme Nyingthig (Tib. spelling: 'chi med 'phags ma'i snying thig, Innermost Essence teachings of the Immortal Bodhisattva <nowiki>[Arya Tārā]</nowiki>).\n\nEarlier in the 19th century, according to a biography, Nyala Pema Dündul received a Hidden Treasure, Tārā Teaching and Nyingthig (Tib. nying thig) from his uncle Kunsang Dudjom (Tib. kun bzang bdud 'joms). It is not clear from the source whether the terma teaching and the nyingthig teachings refer to the same text or two different texts.\n\n"}
{"id": "1775712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1775712", "title": "The Hackensaw Boys", "text": "The Hackensaw Boys\n\nThe Hackensaw Boys are a string band based in central Virginia that formed in 1999. The band has drawn on many musical influences and are \"[k]nown best for rowdy, energetic live shows.\" They have performed at Bonnaroo, Lockn', FloydFest, and the All Good Music Festival. The band tours continuously and claims twenty or more current and former members. The current four-piece lineup contains only one original member, David Sickmen, who rejoined the group in 2012 (after quitting in 2005).\n\nIn April 2016 the band released \"Charismo\" on Free Dirt Records, their first studio album in almost a decade — which was produced by Larry Campbell.\n\nThe Hackensaw Boys were founded in the Fall of 1999 by Rob Bullington, Tom Peloso, David Sickmen, and Robert \"Bobby\" St. Ours who were all living in Charlottesville, Virginia at the time. Sickmen and Bullington met in Harrisonburg, Virginia in the early 1990s when the latter was attending James Madison University there. Bullington was playing in a band called Fried Moose, while Sickmen was in a group called Pieboy with Ward Harrison (who would later join Hackensaw).Peloso formed a band with some friends in the same decade called Chigger, singing lead and playing the \"doghouse bass\". All had performed as young musicians on the open mic stage at the Little Grill diner in Harrisonburg, as well.\n\nBefore starting The Hackensaw Boys, Sickmen and Peloso had been talking about other possible music projects. The four founding members decided to form an old-time music group — infused with the energy and spirit of punk rock — while attending an early performance of Old Crow Medicine Show at the much-storied Miller's Restaurant in Charlottesville.\n\nHackensaw would later develop their own sound busking on the streets of Virginia. Ferd Moyse joined the group at the Town Pump Tavern in Black Mountain, North Carolina where they would often play. As a bartender at the tavern, Moyse would sit in with the band on \"old-time fiddle\" until he \"just had to join\".\n\nAfter experiencing vocal trouble for almost a decade, Sickmen had surgery to remove vocal polyps in 2015. Though the operation may not have improved his singing voice, he says, his voice is \"stronger\" as a result of undergoing it.\n\nIn the Fall of 2000, an enlarged group of twelve musicians departed from Virginia in a 1964 GMC motorcoach, nicknamed \"The Dirty Bird\", on the six-week Get Some Tour of \"theaters, bars, street corners and alleys.\" The bus had been given to the group by Charlottesville developer Oliver Kuttner, together with a second one dubbed \"Ramblin' Fever,\" which went to Mark S. Hahn, then owner of the Blue Moon Diner. Hahn briefly served as manager for the group.\n\nThe group took part in the Unlimited Sunshine Tour the first two years. The 2002 tour included headliner Cake, De La Soul, The Flaming Lips, Modest Mouse, and Kinky. In addition to Cake, the 2003 tour featured Cheap Trick, \"garage rockers\" The Detroit Cobras, and \"country legend\" Charlie Louvin of the Louvin Brothers. In 2003 they served as Country Music Hall of Fame member Charlie Louvin's backing band on one of his last nationwide tours. They opened for Modest Mouse twice (a group founding member Tom Peloso eventually joined). The group continued to gain \"a following as it traveled.\" It has performed with such major acts as Cracker, Camper Van Beethoven, and Railroad Earth. A tour in Europe featured events in Belgium and the Netherlands. Overseas they have performed in such cities as Antwerp, Amsterdam (Paradiso), London, Dublin, Brussels, and Utrecht. At the height of their popularity they have played venues in major music towns like Seattle, Asheville, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Knoxville, New York, Portland, Baltimore, Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Although, more recently the band has been relegated to clubs and bars in small markets, often struggling to draw more than a sparse crowd.\n\nPrior tours included appearances at the Bonnaroo Music Festival (2003 and 2004), Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado (2003), All Good Music Festival (2004 and 2006), FloydFest in Virginia (2003), and Pickathon in Oregon. Appearances at European music festivals include Pukkelpop in Belgium (2005) and Bergenfest in Norway (2007 and 2008).\n\nThey came up with nicknames for each other because it seemed all of the old country and blues performers had them. This became a big part of their act. Original members included Robert \"Mahlon\" Bullington (1999–2011), Thomas \"Pee Paw\" Peloso (1999–2004), David \"Shiner\" Sickmen (1999–2005; rejoined 2012), and Robert \"Uncle Blind Bobby\" St. Ours (1999–2003). Phillip \"Jigsaw\" St. Ours played washboard in both Hackensaw and Old Crow early on (1999–2001), and then for Hackensaw in (2008). Other early members included Jesse \"Baby J.\" Fiske (1999–2011), Phil \"Slate Hill Phil\" Gianniny (1999–2001; d. 2006), and Jimmy \"Kooky-Eyed Fox\" Stelling (1999–2007). Others to join the ever-evolving group have included Chris \"Sawzall\" Johnson (1999–2001), Justin \"Salvage\" Neuhardt (1999–2010), David \"Bellows Lugusi\" Goldstein (1999–2004), Charlie \"C.B.\" Bell (1999–2004), and Shawn \"Plantain\" Galbraith (2007–2012). Ferd \"Four\" Moyse joined in 2004, Ward \"Cousin Spits\" Harrison in 2006, Brian \"Nugget\" Gorby in 2010, and Ben \"JuJu\" Jacobs in 2012.\n\nThe Hackensaw Boys derived their name \"from the actions you perform on a mandolin (hack) and a fiddle (saw).\" Says Bullington \"it was one of those jokes that sort of sticks . . and after about a week and you've played six or seven shows during the course of that week, you have no choice but to keep the name.\"\n\nThe first two Hackensaw Boys albums were released by the Valley Entertainment label: \"Get Some\" in 2000 and \"Keep It Simple\" in 2002. The releases proved to have limited commercial appeal.\n\n\"\"Keep It Simple\", is packed with vigorous, pitchy bursts\" notes Amanda Petrusich in her Pitchfork review, noting the album \"doesn't perfectly reflect the band's fast-and-fierce live show . .\n\n\"Get Some\" was recorded by Rhoderick Cole in his Charlottesville mansion. \"Keep It Simple\" was recorded in Sickmen's apartment in Charlottesville's Linen Building, also by Cole who did the sound engineering on both recordings. \"Give It Back\", released in 2004, was self-produced.\n\nThe group signed with the music label Nettwerk for the 2005 release of \"Love What You Do\". Their second release for Nettwerk Records, \"Look Out!\" in 2007, was a \"celebratory but defiant sound culled from old-time mountains, backstage doorways and punishing drives through the evolving American landscape\" according to Isthmus/The Daily Page.\n\nAnother reviewer concurred, stating the album \"is the Boys at their best, a perfect medium between their raw early years and the more polished sound of their previous release.\" Bullington states \"Look Out!\" \"was definitely an attempt to capture sonically and as beautifully as possible, the sound of the Hackensaws onstage.\" The group went into the studio \"with the defined intention of . . trying to capture the live performance as best as we possibly could. And I think we totally succeeded in doing that.\" The album \"got to No. 6 on the Americana music charts\" and \"contained nine originals including a couple from the sometimes Modest Mouse, sometimes Hackensaw Tom Peloso.\"\n\nFollowing the release of \"Love What You Do\" and \"Look Out!\", The Hackensaws departed from Nettwerk Records to release two independently produced six-song EPs, \"The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 1\" and \"The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 2\" These two collections are \"recommended for anyone who feels that time, popularity and (maybe) Don Was has watered down Old Crow Medicine Show, The Hackensaw Boys bring the Appalachian string band roots with punk rock flowers hard and raw.\" The albums resulted from recording sessions held at the Sound of Music studios in Richmond, Virginia. They were mastered by Grammy award winner Charlie Pilzer. As with \"Look Out!\" in 2007, all songs were engineered by Bryan Hoffa, archival audio restoration specialist at the Library of Congress. The titles, bestowed by Ferd Lionel Moyse IV were inspired by the fact that these were the last two recording projects to come out of the old Sound Of Music facility, which has recently moved to a new building in Richmond.\n\nThe group released \"Charismo\" through Free Dirt Records in 2016, after almost a decade without putting together a studio album. Larry Campbell produced. Glide Magazine said of the album that the group take \"a tack similar to that of Old Crow Medicine Show, the Punk Brothers, The Howlin' Brothers and other modern outfits that draw from the past to make an impression in the present.\" They went on to say that theirs is \"a sound once heard on back porches throughout the heartland, now brought to life with the stirring enthusiasm of would-be rock stars performing for appreciative audiences.\"\n\nA distinctive aspect of the Hackensaw live-performance experience is the percussion instrument known as a \"charismo\". Invented and played by former band member Justin \"Salvage\" Neuhardt, who also performed on spoons and the musical saw, it is described as \"a home-made tin can contraption.\" As founder Sickmen remembers it:\n\nCalvin James Pynn of The Tartan (Radford University) states \"Neuhardt's charismo\" is the \"most notable\" of the group's instruments:\n\nIn an interview with Scott Simon of N.P.R. Neuhardt himself explains how it came to be:\n\nBrian Gorby, Neuhardt's friend and former bandmate in the percussion-heavy jam-band Humble Sacrifice, has carried on the charismo's tradition in the Hackensaw Boys as their touring percussionist. With funk influences, Gorby uses the charismo to bring a rambunctious flair to the band's old-time style.\n\nAs former member and founder Bullington puts it \"we can play an old folks home in the afternoon and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. They all seem to enjoy it equally.\" Fellow founder Sickmen claims \"the original intent of the band . . was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock.\" Band member Jesse \"Baby J.\" Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: \"We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is.\" The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: \"We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness.\" \"I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band,\" states bandleader David Sickmen: \"I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way.\"\n\n\nCurrent \"tour lineup\" as of January 2014:\n\n\nLPs:\n\n\nEPs:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5354547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5354547", "title": "Wandering Spirit (Cree leader)", "text": "Wandering Spirit (Cree leader)\n\nWandering Spirit (a.k.a. Kapapamahchakwew, Papamahchakwayo, Esprit Errant; b.1845 – d.1885) was a Cree war chief of a band of Plains Cree. There is little information on Wandering Spirit’s life. Most of what is known begins shortly before the 1885 Frog Lake Massacre and ends with his execution at the hands of the Canadian government. However, there is some information regarding his role within the Plains Cree people.\n\nWandering Spirit was a young war chief among the Plains Cree and frequently came into conflict with the band’s titular leader, Chief Big Bear. Whenever Big Bear left the band for a period of time, Wandering Spirit and Big Bear’s son, Imasees, were left in command. Both had challenged Big Bear for full leadership in 1885 but were unsuccessful. Wandering Spirit's failed run for leadership left his popularity waning among his supporters, as Big Bears experience was valued over Wandering Spirit’s enthusiasm to punish their oppressors. Aside from the Frog Lake Massacre, Wandering Spirit gained notoriety for his conquests in battle. During his lifetime he participated in many attacks on the Blackfoot warriors and was successful in killing many of them.\n\nThe Frog Lake Massacre occurred within a wider context of starvation, ecological change, and political and cultural conflict. During the 1880s, the Plains Cree were suffering from the decline of the buffalo population, which they had traditionally depended on for sustenance. Buffalo were becoming scarce throughout Canada due to overhunting. This created a particular animosity between the Plains Cree and the Métis, who were seen as \"half-breeds\" infringing upon the Plains Cree’s hunting grounds. Another reason for the decline in the buffalo was the introduction of firearms, which combined with the European settlers’ demand for buffalo fur robes and pemmican allowed for unsustainable hunting practices. The Plains Cree often trespassed on Blackfoot lands in search of buffalo and blamed any deaths this incurred on the Hudson’s Bay Company, whose trading conquests they felt had forced their hand.\n\nIn the absence of buffalo Indigenous groups came to rely on government rations, which were administered by local Indian Agents. This was a source of contention. There were instances of insufficient or spoiled rations. Indigenous groups felt that the treaty rights they had negotiated with the colonial government were not being respected; meanwhile, as the Conservative and Liberal parties grappled for power, they pressured one another to cut expenditures on welfare programs like those out west. Starvation and politics strained the already tense relationships between natives and European traders.\n\nAfter extensive fighting with the Blackfoot, the Plains Cree were ordered by the Canadian government to relocate to Frog Lake, where they shared the territory with their cousins the Woods Cree. Frog Lake was not a reservation, and Big Bear’s band subsisted there with minimal provisions or government assistance.\n\nIndian Affairs attempted to shepherd them onto a reservation through the denial of rations. The local Indian Agent was Thomas Quinn, noted by historians as being “a mean-spirited, petty little man completely lacking in compassion.” Infamously, he once summoned the natives around Frog Lake to the ration house in promise of food only to declare to the emaciated masses that it had been an April Fool’s prank and they would receive nothing. Quinn was unpopular with the Plains Cree and Wandering Spirit in particular. After a disagreement, Wandering Spirit had once threatened Quinn by telling him that he “used to enjoy killing a person” and missed the feeling. Following this incident the government recommended that Quinn relocate to Fort Pitt for his own safety. Quinn refused and remained at Frog Lake.\n\nThis discontent was instrumental in the massacre. Contrary to Big Bear’s attempts at diplomacy, Wandering Spirit favoured a more aggressive resistance strategy that resonated with the warlike members of the band and won him popular support. This would culminate in the deaths of nine European traders.\n\nEven though Big Bear, was against the attacks he later served time in jail for not preventing it from happening. It was the war chief, Wandering Spirit, that held the ruling power in the tribe at the time of the attack and he used his position to lead the men into the Frog Lake settlement while Big Bear was away. While historians cannot confirm the reason for Big Bear's absence from his band at the time, the most prolific theory is that he was suffering from alcohol poisoning.\n\nAfter seeing the success of the Métis in the Battle of Duck Lake, the Cree felt more confident in their ability to combat the Canadian government and seized the opportunity to make their own move against the colonial government.\n\nThey hoped to take the people in the Frog Lake settlement as hostages and seize its provisions before going to join the Métis and Louis Riel at Fort Pitt. When the attack on Frog Lake began, they took Thomas Quinn as a hostage in his home because of his status and his cruelty. After allowing the townspeople to attend mass at the church, the Cree men would not let them leave and took them as their hostages inside. When the Cree attempted to move their hostages from the town to the war camp they had set up, Quinn refused to cooperate with them anymore, leading Wandering Spirit to shoot him in the head with his rifle. This resulted in panic among the hostages. Spurred by Wandering Spirit's actions, his warriors massacred eight more unarmed people. With nine of their hostages dead, the Cree men took the remaining settlers with them as their prisoners.\n\nThe Cree took their hostages to the war camp that they had set up outside of the settlement before the battle began. The hostages were warned that they would be safe so long as they remained inside the camp, but that everyone found outside would be considered an enemy.\n\nBig Bear had been eating breakfast with the wife of the manager of the Hudson's Bay Company when he heard the news, but immediately returned to his band to put an end to the violence. He moved the tribe further north in hopes of isolating the group from further violence.\n\nWandering Spirit resolved to capture Fort Pitt two weeks following the Frog Lake Massacre. The fort contained provisions and ammunition, which appealed to the starving Cree. The conquest was also supported by Louis Riel, as Fort Pitt housed a North-West Mounted Police detachment that could prove to be a threat during a rebellion.\n\nIt was a brief and almost bloodless conflict. After Corporal David Cowan was shot and killed, Fort Pitt was surrendered to the Cree.\n\nThe death of a North-West Mounted Police officer caused an uproar. Settlers projected anxieties of another Riel conspiracy onto the Cree, who were depicted in newspapers like the \"Saskatchewan Herald\" as villainous. Wandering Spirit, however, insisted that the Cree had only been reacting against starvation and that there was no larger plot at hand. During this time, Wandering Spirit's band followed him out of a sense of crisis but generally abhorred the violence.\n\nThe band retreated north with their stolen supplies. They were pursued by law enforcement, and after several months Wandering Spirit was cornered. He surrendered and attempted to commit suicide by stabbing himself in the chest, but only pierced a lung. He was taken into custody.\n\nAfter Wandering Spirit was captured, he was held in custody until the trial took place at Battleford. The court case was overseen by the Magistrate Charles Rouleau. Around the same time as the Frog Lake Massacre, Rouleau received a telegram informing him that his home had been burned down by the Cree during the Looting of Battleford. At this time several other Indigenous men such as Little Bear (Apaschiskoos), Walking the Sky (a.k.a. Round the Sky), Bad Arrow, and Miserable Man, Iron Body, Ika (a.k.a. Crooked leg), and Man Without Blood were also facing charges. They were put on trial for the murders committed during the Frog Lake Massacre. Throughout Wandering Spirit's trial, he spoke freely about his actions regarding both the Frog Lake Massacre and the capture of Fort Pitt. This was an admission of guilt so that he could clear his conscience and have assurances for his afterlife. However, Wandering Spirit was not permitted access to legal counsel during this time. Additionally, the trials were held in English which prevented many of the accused from defending themselves against the charges. Aside from legal matters, the majority of Wandering Spirit's communications were with missionaries, who often encouraged Indigenous people, such as Wandering Spirit and the other men who were held prisoner, to plead guilty regardless of whether they committed the crime or not. Originally Wandering Spirit refused to speak to the missionaries up until he had a \"spiritual awakening\" prior to his execution. It was at this point that Wandering Spirit was baptized.\n\nEven though Wandering Spirit did plead guilty to the charges laid against him, he insisted that he only played a minor role in the uprising, as he felt immense guilt for the role he had played in both the Frog Lake Massacre and the death of Thomas Quinn. He even said that he \"fought against it, Imasees nor the others would let [him] go.\" On September 22, after confessing to shooting Thomas Quinn in the head at point-blank range. Wandering Spirit was sentenced to hang by Rouleau. Rouleau described Wandering Spirit as \"the greatest killer ever to walk on two legs in America.\" In many ways the use of the death penalty in Wandering Spirit's trial was seen as a way for the government to reassert its dominance over the land and its occupants during times of civil unrest.\n\nThe Canadian government hoped to make an example of Wandering Spirit and his men to discourage future uprisings by Indigenous peoples. Sir John A MacDonald said on the hanging that “we must vindicate the position of the white man; we must teach the Indians what law is.” The plan was for the eight men to be hung two at a time, but it was later decided that all eight would be hung together.\n\nOn November 27, 1885, Wandering Spirit was executed as part of the 1885 Hangings at Battleford, which holds the record for Canada’s largest mass execution. Wandering Spirit had said that he wished his death alone could atone for his acts, as he was saddened that seven others had to die with him. A myth circulated that Wandering Spirit sung a love song to his wife as he was hanged. However, there are no reputable sources that substantiate this claim. Sources do indicate that Wandering Spirit appeared stoic during the hanging, while the other men were singing death chants.\n\nWandering Spirit’s body was interred in a mass grave in Battleford along with the other men hung at Battleford in 1885. Originally unmarked, a tombstone with the names of the eight men buried there was erected in December 1985 to mark the one-hundredth anniversary by the North West Centennial Advisory Committee and Battleford City Council, with both groups splitting the costs along with a grant from the Provincial Department of Culture and Recreation.\n\nIn 1976, Elder Pauline Shirt and Elder Vern Harper established the Wandering Spirit Survival School of Toronto, which has been renamed as the First Nations Junior and Senior School of Toronto.The School began meeting in the Harper-Shirt household's living room in the Bain Co-op with a handful of children and soon outgrew the space. They moved temporarily into the Native Canadian Centre's second-floor rooms before finding a suitable space and being designated an \"Alternative School.\" The school was named Wandering Spirit, who was Elder Pauline's Great-Grandfather. In 1983 the school was renamed First Nations School of Toronto. A documentary about the school was made in 1978 and can be found in the National Film Board of Canada archives. In 1985, a tombstone with the names of the eight men executed at Battleford was erected by the North West Centennial Advisory Committee (NWCAC) and Battleford City council to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the execution. In attendance were Culture and Recreation Minister Rick Folk, Chief Lawrence of Poundmaker, NWCAC member Gordon Tootoosis and Harvey Johnson who was the Director of the NWCAC. Chairman of the NWCAC Irwin McInstosh was quoted as saying “This mass grave commemoration is the last historical date of any significance in the North West Rebellion.” Rich Folk added “We are not here to pass judgement on the Indian people who lie buried here in this mass grave, that was done 100 years earlier when they were arraigned for acts of violence during the Rebellion but, this gravesite marker will serve as a call to peace and a reminder that violence and war is never the solution.” A sign and permanent teepee were added in the same year. \nIn 2013, the gravesite was vandalized. Ray Fox, the groundskeeper, said in regards to the damage “I’m just saying we need to talk about these kinds of things because this is not pretty, as you can see, when you’re looking at this gravestone and it’s been deliberately pushed over and our tee-pee structure here that we erected as a memorial to these warriors is strung all over this place in this piece of property. That’s not respect.” He added that whether or not someone agrees with what the men did, their final resting place should be respected.\n"}

He is known all over Mongolia, and also mentioned or pictured in some accounts of contemporary western travellers.\n\nAccording to an interview with his daughter G.

He was not particularly big as a child, only had long fingers. Because he always ate a lot, he became a bit unpopular with his parents, and eventually was sent to Ikh Khüree. One day, he was summoned to the Bogd Khan, given fresh clothes, and after a while he was even made to marry a woman who worked as one of the Bogd Khan's seamstresses, on the grounds that according to a horoscope by the Bogd Khan, their fates were connected. \n\nThe accounts are a bit at odds about what Gongor's occupation at the Bogd Khan's court was: accountant and keeper of the Bogd Khan's elephant, the Bogd Khan's bodyguard, or wrestler.
