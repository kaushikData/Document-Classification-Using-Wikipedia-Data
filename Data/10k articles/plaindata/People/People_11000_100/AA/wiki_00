He made his first appearance on-screen on 14 January 2001. Adam was played by Iain De Caestecker from the character's first appearance in 2001 until 21 July 2003 with Robertson taking over the role from 31 December 2004 until 20 April 2007. Robertson reprised the role in 2016 and made his return on screen on 16 November 2016. Adam is the son of Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) and Susan Barlow (Joanna Foster), and the grandson of Ken Barlow (William Roache).\n\nAdam first appears aged 12 when he is visiting his uncle Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), grandfather Ken Barlow (William Roache) and Ken's partner Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride), with his mother, Susan Barlow (Joanna Foster). It is revealed that Ken's arch enemy and Susan's former husband, Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), is Adam's father. Adam was injured in a car crash that killed Susan. Adam goes to live with Mike but leaves to go to boarding school in Scotland, but returns after doing his Highers exams.\n\nAdam purchases a car from an auction, but in an embarrassing turn of events, after filling his car up with petrol on a day out with his girlfriend Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), his car ignites by the roadside. The cause of the fire is a mystery, until a policewoman informs him that his car functions on diesel, not petrol. He works at his father's factory, \"Underworld\", and irritates his older half-brother, Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh), by being the apple of his father's eye. He is dumped by ambitious Candice via letter, has a short fling with Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu), and has a crush on Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) when he first returns to Weatherfield. Adam begins dating shy factory worker Joanne Jackson (Zaraah Abrahams) after they flirt at his birthday party.\n\nAdam was devastated when Mike died of a heart attack. Adam was determined to bring Danny down after he steals his inheritance, unaware that Mike's will is invalid because a more recent will left everything to him. Only Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and Danny are aware that it existed and Danny is determined to ensure that Adam does not get his inheritance. However, following her split from Danny, Leanne gives a copy of the new will to Adam and he could have claimed his inheritance and press criminal charges against Danny. After Danny is questioned by the police, he offers Adam a 40% share of the factory and acting on Ken's advice, he accepts. In September 2006, Adam sells his 40% to Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier). Liam's older brother, Paul (Sean Gallagher), purchases the remaining 60% in January 2007. Joanne later dumps Adam by text message, after not seeing him for months. Adam leaves Weatherfield in April and moves to Portsmouth with his uncle, Peter, where they open a bookies together.\n\nIn November 2016, on his return to Weatherfield, Adam is caught in \"Underworld\" by current owner, Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) and his son, Aiden Connor (Shayne Ward). He, Peter and his step-aunt, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), visit Ken in hospital. They meet Ken's son, Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard). Adam joins his family for a meal and defends Tracy against her ex-husband, Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). Adam gets revenge on Robert by calling environmental health. Daniel is suspected of stealing Adam's car when Tracy and Adam visit his flat and find student debts and become suspicious when his mother, Denise Osbourne (Denise Black) is nowhere to be found. Adam later has sex with Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon), causing a fight between him and Aidan in The Rovers. Adam continues his feud with Aidan, while forming a friendly rivalry with Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) and Daniel.\n\nIn February 2017, Adam has sex with Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) and they begin a relationship. Adam finds out that Rosie and her sister, Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent), buried cocaine in Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) allotment. When Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant, Adam becomes prime suspect as he and Ken argued about Ken's will. Adam uses the drugs to blackmail Rosie into giving him a false alibi but is arrested when Rosie's alibi is proved false. As there is insufficient evidence to charge Adam, he is released. Adam becomes suspicious of Daniel but Tracy believes Adam was responsible and tries to set him up but he finds out and reveals that he is suspicious of Tracy. Tracy's daughter Amy Barlow (Ella Mulvaney), believes Adam is responsible and calls the police with evidence to prove that Adam is responsible. Adam is released again but his intentions turn to Daniel and his girlfriend, Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn). When Tracy and Amy disappear, Adam uses this to his advantage and frames her. Tracy confesses, trying to protect Amy as she believes that Amy could be responsible. Adam suspects Daniel after Tracy is cleared and kidnaps him, taking him to an isolated area and intends to make him confess but fails and Daniel escapes. Adam is arrested again and charged with Ken's attack, Daniel is revealed as Ken's real attacker as he hit him over the head with a poetry book, making him fall down the stairs.\n\nAdam later discovers that Aidan is having an affair with Maria, when he sees them kissing. Adam takes a photo of them and uses it to blackmail Aidan. He plans to expose the affair to Aidan's fiancée, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), but Eva reveals that she is aware of his affair with Maria and begs Adam to stop blackmailing Aidan, before revealing that she has faked her pregnancy so that Aidan will not go to Maria. Adam agrees, but Eva reveals that she is out for revenge and needs Adam's help. Adam agrees and they plan revenge. However, as Eva is about to marry Aidan, she changes her mind at the last minute about the plan to clear the factory and the bank accounts, unaware that Adam has proceeded with the plan. When the Connors discover Eva's deceit, they report her to the police. Eva angrily vows to Adam that she intends to drag him to prison with her.\n\nAdam's existence is that of a retcon. Although off-screen, Susan didn't fake an abortion so she could leave Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), she \"aborted\" her child as she wasn't prepared for motherhood. Also 2001 seems to hint that Ken never had contact with Susan after 1987 so wasn't aware of Adam, however this is untrue as he still visited Susan off-screen in that time. Susan was said to be present at Peter's wedding in 1990. Adam was introduced in January 2001, played by Iain De Caestecker, as part of a storyline which involved a custody battle between long-time rivals Ken Barlow (William Roache) and Mike, the character of Adam departed at the conclusion of the storyline, however De Caestecker reprised the role for two separate stints in 2002 and 2003. On 13 December 2004, it was reported by \"Digital Spy\" that the role of Adam had been recast with Sam Robertson taking over the role from 31 December 2004.\n\nIn July 2016, it was announced that \"Coronation Street\" would be extending the Barlow family by reintroducing Adam along with Peter Barlow and Daniel Osbourne. It was announced that Chris Gascoyne had reprised his role as Peter and Rob Mallard had taken over the role as Daniel, followed by Robertson reprising his role as Adam. Addressing the plans, producer Kate Oates told \"Digital Spy\": \"One of the things I am most excited about and something I consider a real privilege is that I am lucky enough to work on the longest-running soap. One of the longest-running families on that soap is the Barlows and why would you not want to strengthen that family? I love the idea of Ken as the head of the family which has Tracy, Simon and Amy. I am excited to bring Peter back to the show. I am delighted to meet Daniel Osborne, who is Ken’s child with Denise and I am excited to bring back Adam, who is Mike Baldwin’s son and Ken’s grandson. I think that strong family dynasty - the first family on the soap, as it were - here, big, strong and sending ripples through the street, is really exciting and I am really looking forward to seeing that.”\n\nOf his return, Robertson said, “I’m delighted to be back. Coronation Street was my first job as an actor and is a special place for me. As a young actor it was a little overwhelming, so I’m looking forward to coming back and stamping my mark on the character - I feel there’s unfinished business with Adam\". In an interview with the \"Radio Times\", asked if Adam would become a womaniser like his father Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Robertson replied: \"Oh yes, it’s in my contract! Absolutely Adam’s a womaniser and at the minute he doesn’t seem to have much regard for the women he’s with. He doesn’t seem to have much heart, but maybe this is leading to him getting his fingers burnt.\n\nIn 2017, a \"whodunnit\" storyline involving the character of Ken Barlow began; the storyline saw an unknown person push Ken down the stairs in the Barlow household, with Adam being named as one of the suspects alongside Daniel, Peter, Tracy, Amy, Pat Phelan and Sinead Tinker. ITV released a poll to the \"Coronation Street\" website so that fans could share their thoughts as to who pushed Ken. Fans and viewers used the poll, with the majority's thoughts of the attacker being Adam. Robertson later admitted that he thinks Adam pushed Ken.\n\nIn August 2017, Robertson was longlisted for Sexiest Male at the Inside Soap Awards. He made the viewer-voted shortlist, but lost out to Davood Ghadami, who portrays Kush Kazemi in \"EastEnders\".\n"}

Gibson's poetry focuses on gender norms, politics, social reform, and the struggles LGBTQ people face in today's society.\n\nGibson grew up in Calais, Maine. A child of Mark and Shirley Gibson, Gibson has one sister, Laura, who is mentioned in a poem \"The Moon Is a Kite\". Growing up in a Baptist home and attending local schools, Gibson later attended Saint Joseph's College of Maine.\n\nMoving with a girlfriend, Gibson lived for a time in New Orleans, and later the two moved in 1999 to Boulder, Colorado, where they settled. They went to their first open-mic in Denver, where Gibson was inspired to become a spoken word artist.\n\nGibson also goes by Andrew and uses gender-neutral pronouns. Many poems are about gender identity, such as \"Swing Set\" and \"Andrew\". Gibson has said, regarding gender, \"I don't necessarily identify within a gender binary. I've never in my life really felt like a woman and I've certainly never felt like a man. I look at gender on a spectrum and I feel somewhere on that spectrum that's not landing on either side of that.\"\n\nA four-time Denver Grand Slam Champion, Gibson finished fourth at the 2004 National Poetry Slam, and third at both the 2006 and 2007 Individual World Poetry Slam.

Gibson says the writing practice is to music, so it seemed natural to collaborate with a musician. This album was also an effort to write about risky topics that carried a threat. Confronting fear was a theme in poems of the following album, \"Flower Boy.\" Most recently, Gibson released \"Truce\" in 2013.\n\nGibson cites Sonya Renee, Derrick Brown, Anis Mojgani, Patricia Smith, and Mary Oliver as influences. Throughout the year, Gibson tours universities and other venues across the country.\n\nIn addition to using poetry to provide social and political commentary on gender and LGBTQ issues, Gibson is involved with many activist groups, and also performs at Take Back the Night events, LGBTQ events, pride events, trans events, anti-war rallies, peace rallies, organizations against the occupation of Palestine, and groups focused on examining the wrongs of capitalism, patriarchy and white supremacy. For twenty years, Gibson performed with Vox Feminista, a \"performance tribe of radical feminists bent on social change through cultural revolution.\"\n\nIn 2013, alongside Kelsey Gibb, Gibson launched the website and support system, \"Stay Here With Me.\" The tumblr for Stay Here With Me presents it as \"an interactive, safe space offering collective support while encouraging individual healing to keep those who visit alive today, and wanting to stay alive until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "214240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214240", "title": "Andrew Cunanan", "text": "Andrew Cunanan\n\nAndrew Phillip Cunanan (31 August 1969 – 23 July 1997) was an American spree killer who murdered at least five people, including Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace and Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin, during a three-month period in mid-1997. Cunanan's string of murders ended on July 23 with his suicide by firearm. He was 27 years old.\n\nIn his final years, Cunanan lived without a job, befriending wealthy older men and spending their money to impress acquaintances in the local gay community in Miami Beach, Florida by boasting about social events at clubs and often paying the check at restaurants. One millionaire friend had broken up with Cunanan in 1996, the prior year.\n\nAndrew Phillip Cunanan was born August 31, 1969, in National City, California, to Modesto \"Pete\" Cunanan, a Filipino American, and Mary Anne Schillaci, an Italian American, the youngest of four children. Modesto was serving in the US Navy in the Vietnam War at the time of his son's birth; after leaving the Navy, where he had served as a career officer, he worked as a stockbroker.\n\nIn 1981, Cunanan's father enrolled him in the independent day school, The Bishop's School in the affluent La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego. At school, Cunanan was remembered as being bright and very talkative, and testing with an I.Q. of 142. As a teenager, however, he developed a reputation as a prolific liar given to telling fantastic tales about his family and personal life. He was also adept at changing his appearance according to what he felt was most attractive at a given moment. Nonetheless, in high school he was voted ‘Least Likely to be Forgotten’.\n\nIn 1988, when Andrew was 19, Modesto deserted his family and moved to the Philippines to evade arrest for embezzlement. That same year, Cunanan – who identified as gay in high school and even then had liaisons with wealthy older men – had begun frequenting local gay clubs and restaurants, and his deeply religious mother Mary Anne learned that Cunanan was gay.\n\nDuring an argument, Andrew threw his mother against a wall, dislocating her shoulder. Later examination of his behavior from reports indicates that he may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, a personality disorder characterized by an abnormal lack of remorse.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1987, Cunanan enrolled at the University of California, San Diego, where he majored in American History. After dropping out, two years later, he settled in the Castro District of San Francisco.\n\"Town and Country\" reported that in San Francisco, Cunanan – who also used the aliases Andrew DeSilva, Lt. Cmdr. Andy Cummings, Drew Cunningham, and Curt Matthew Demaris – \"became a fixture in the nightlife of the Castro district, a gay neighborhood, befriending wealthy older men, and also reportedly took an interest in creating violent pornography.\" Cunanan also socialized in the Hillcrest and La Jolla neighborhoods of San Diego, as well as in Scottsdale, Arizona, \"apparently living off the largess of one wealthy patron or another,\" and at least in part, supporting himself by dealing drugs.\n\nIn 1990, Cunanan first met Gianni Versace, whom he would eventually kill outside his home on Miami Beach. Versace was in town to be feted for the costumes he had designed for the opera \"Capriccio.\"\n\nIn 1996, Cunanan and Norman Blachford broke up. Blachford was a wealthy older man who had been hosting and financially supporting him. Now on his own, Cunanan maxed out his credit cards. Cunanan's friend, Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Trail, had told Michael Williams (Trail's former roommate) that Cunanan had resumed his prior profession of selling drugs; Cunanan also began increasingly consuming them.\n\nIn late April 1997, Cunanan told friends he was leaving San Diego, beginning with a trip to Minneapolis to visit David Madson, 33, an up-and-coming architect and Cunanan's former lover and their mutual friend Jeff Trail, 28, a former US Navy officer working as a district manager for a propane delivery company. Both had distanced themselves from him. Trail expected Cunanan to move to San Francisco upon leaving Minneapolis. A week before Cunanan killed him, Trail had told Williams that he had had a \"\"huge falling out\" with Cunanan and \"I made a lot of enemies this weekend ... I've got to get out of here. They're going to kill me\".\"\n\nOn April 24, Cunanan and four friends attended a going-away party at California Cuisine, a rare occasion when Cunanan did not cover the food tab. On April 25, Cunanan arrived in the Twin Cities and stayed at Madson's loft apartment.\n\nCunanan's killing spree began in Minneapolis on 27 April 1997, with the murder of his close friend Jeffrey Trail, a former US Navy officer and propane salesman. Following an argument, Cunanan beat Trail to death with a claw hammer and left his body rolled in a rug in a loft apartment belonging to architect David Madson.\n\nMadson, who had once been Cunanan's lover, was his second murder victim; Madson's body was found on the east shore of Rush Lake near Rush City, Minnesota, on 3 May 1997, with gunshot wounds to the head and back from a pistol Cunanan had taken from the home of his first victim, Jeff Trail.\n\nCunanan next drove to Chicago and killed 72 year-old Lee Miglin, a prominent real estate developer, on 4 May 1997. Cunanan bound Miglin's hands and feet and wrapped his head with duct tape. He then stabbed Miglin over 20 times with a screwdriver, and sawed open his throat with a hacksaw. Following this murder, Cunanan became the 449th fugitive to be listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.\n\nFive days later, Cunanan, who had taken Miglin's car, found his fourth victim in Pennsville, New Jersey, at Finn's Point National Cemetery. Cunanan shot and killed 45 year-old caretaker William Reese, then stole his red pickup truck.\n\nWhile the manhunt unsuccessfully focused on Reese's stolen truck, which Cunanan still had, he \"hid in plain sight\" in Miami Beach, Florida for two months. Cunanan even used his own name to pawn a stolen item, despite knowing that police routinely review pawn shop records.\n\nOn 15 July 1997, Cunanan murdered Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace, by shooting him twice on the front stairway of his Miami Beach mansion Casa Casuarina. A witness attempted to pursue Cunanan, but was unable to catch up to him.\n\nResponding police found Reese's stolen vehicle parked in a nearby garage, loaded with Cunanan's clothes, an alternative passport, and clipped newspaper reports of Cunanan's murders.\n\nIn the upstairs bedroom of a Miami Beach houseboat on 23 July 1997, eight days after killing Versace and with law enforcement hot on his trail, Cunanan killed himself with a gunshot through the mouth. Cunanan used a .40 S&W caliber Taurus PT100 semi-automatic pistol which he had stolen from Jeff Trail, the first of his five victims, committing suicide with the same gun he used to kill Madson, Reese, and Versace.\n\nCunanan's cremated remains are interred in the mausoleum at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery in San Diego, California.\n\nCunanan's motivation remains unknown. At the time of the murders, there was extensive public and press speculation that tied the crimes to Cunanan's discovery that he was HIV positive; however, an autopsy found him to be HIV negative.\n\nAlthough police searched the houseboat where Cunanan died, he left no suicide note and few personal belongings, surprising investigators, given his reputation for acquiring money and expensive possessions from wealthy older men.\n\nCunanan was portrayed by Shane Perdue in the film \"The Versace Murder\" (1998), and by Luke Morrison in the television film \"House of Versace\" (2013).\n\nIn 1999, director William Friedkin wanted Freddie Prinze, Jr. to portray Cunanan in a film which never materialized entitled \"The Man Who Killed Versace\" written by Frederic Raphael.\n\nJonathan Trent portrayed Cunanan in the 2009 film \"Murder in Fashion\" \"Fashion Victim\".\n\nThe American rock band Modest Mouse's album \"Strangers to Ourselves\" (2015) includes a song named after the case: \"Pistol\".\n\nCunanan is portrayed by Darren Criss in \"\", the second season of the anthology series \"American Crime Story\", which premiered on 17 January 2018. Criss later won an Emmy for his portrayal. \n\nThe television series \"Mugshots\" on Court TV (now TruTV) released an episode covering Cunanan, titled \"Andrew Cunanan - The Versace Killer\".\n\nAnother true-crime show, \"Six Degrees Of Murder,\" featured Cunanan's crimes in \"The Body in the Rug,\" the premiere episode of its first season, when it premiered on Investigation Discovery on 13 July 2016.\n\nIn Season 2, Episode 12 of \"American Dad\" the character Roger quotes Cunanan's yearbook by saying “Après moi le déluge” then attributing the quote to Cunanan.\n\nThe ABC television network documentary and news series 20/20 released an episode reporting on evidence tying Cunanan to the murder of Versace \n\n\n"}

He was one of the first generation of English actors to achieve wealth and a degree of social status by means of his trade.\n\nPhillips first enters the historical record as a member of the amalgamation of Lord Strange's Men and the Admiral's Men that performed \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" (perhaps by Richard Tarlton) between 1590 and 1592. In the surviving \"plot\" of this performance, Phillips is assigned the role of Sardanapalus; he is one of the few actors not required to play a double role. He is named in the touring warrant issued to Strange's Men in 1592; after the death of their patron Ferdinando Stanley he joined the new Lord Chamberlain's Men, presumably as a sharer.\n\nPhillips remained with the company through its change to the King's Men and to his death in 1605. Little is known with certainty of his roles with the company, except that he was probably already mature when the company assembled. He appears in the cast lists for Ben Jonson's \"Every Man in His Humour\" (1598), \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" (1599), and \"Sejanus\" (1603). He may be the author of a jig, \"Phillips His Slipper\", entered for publishing in the Stationers' Register in 1595.\n\nHe was one of the six sharers in the Globe Theatre when it was built in 1598–9, with a one-eighth share. Over time this made him a comparatively wealthy man, at least as far as Elizabethan actors were concerned. Like Shakespeare, Phillips lived for many years near his occupation in Southwark, in Paris Garden near the Swan Theatre, and in Aldgate; but by the time of his death he owned a house in Mortlake, in Surrey.\n\nIn 1601, he was the representative of the company called to testify before the Privy Council about their involvement with the rebellion of the Earl of Essex; the Chamberlain's Men had been paid by supporters of the Earl to perform Shakespeare's \"Richard II\" before the abortive coup. Phillips' testimony seems to have assuaged whatever anger the court may have felt towards the players; they were not punished, and indeed played for Elizabeth at Whitehall on 24 February 1601, the night before Essex was executed. (The choice of Phillips as representative is interesting; why him, and not Shakespeare or Burbage? He testified that the Lord Chamberlain's Men had played at the request of Essex's supporters, specifically because they were offered 40 shillings more than their normal fee. This might indicate that Phillips had a role in keeping the financial accounts of the company.)\n\nThe evidence suggests a life deeply intertwined with the theater. He was a stepbrother of his fellow King's Man Thomas Pope, and his sister married another actor, Robert Gough.\n\nPhillips's daughters Magdalen and Rebecca were baptized in the parish of St. Saviour's in Southwark in 1594 and 1596 respectively. A son, Augustine or Austen, was baptized there in 1601 but buried three years later. Phillips's will, which was signed on 4 May 1605 and probated on 13 May 1605, mentions two other daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, and his wife Anne, plus brothers, sisters, and other relations of a large family. The will includes a number of interesting and revealing bequests:\n\n\nThe musical instruments obviously imply that Phillips was a musician, and as such he was probably involved in the dramatic music used in productions throughout his career.\n\n"}

Since 1982, she has been on the faculty of The New School and the School of Visual Arts (Humanities and Sciences Department, Philosophy and Cultural Studies tracks). Since 1988, she has been a faculty member of Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts at Eugene Lang College.\n\nKarp began art studies with Maria Lowenstein (1954 to 1959) and Ian James, 1962. After her Chatham College studies she also studied art at Provincetown Workshop (Leo Manso, Victor Candell, summer 1964) and New York University (Leo Manso, fall 1964, spring 1965). After completing her PhD she studied at the New School for Social Research (Leo Manso, early 1980s); with the Art Students League (Leo Manso, Rudolf Baranik, 1981-1983); and at the Provincetown Art Association Museum School (Selena Trieff, 1983).\n\nShe is currently working on making photography, archiving ancestral photos, and writing about family photography, self-portraiture, portraiture and other kinds of photography.\n\nIn Spring 2008, Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts students conducted peaceful protests, including a conversation with faculty at a Lang College faculty meeting and at other meetings with faculty, administrators, and students; and demonstrating in the college's courtyard and student publications in the Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts paper, “New School Free Press”, sometimes also known as \"IMPRINT\". Students created a public support group on Facebook that they titled Lang Needs Barrie!!! where they put their writings and other materials related to the case. This public support group still existed as of 2016. In an article by Kevin Dugan in the April 1, 2008 issue of the \"New School Free Press\"\", a Lang senior, Jamila Thompson, was quoted as saying, \"If it can happen to Barrie, it can happen to anybody...our voices are not valued.\" According to then-Lang student Anna Bean, in an opinion piece published in the April 15, 2008, \"New School Free Press,\" stated that 120 students, faculty, and alumni of Lang have signed the petition urging the administration to reconsider the decision\" to not renew Karp's contract. In an April 29, 2008 letter to the editor in the \"New School Free Press\", Lang alumna Michelle Salerno described Karp as \"the finest professor I ever had\" and lauded Karp's \"breadth of knowledge on feminism, critical race studies, philosophy and the arts\". The Karp case continued to receive wide attention in the ensuing years. In an article in \"Harper\"’s Magazine, October 2010, Susan Faludi wrote “Soon after the culture and media department absorbed and then dissolved the gender-studies program, Karp was forced out. Not that her expulsion made way for an undated feminist studies. With her departure, the number of professors in the department dedicated to teaching feminism dropped to zero.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "158061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158061", "title": "Burl Ives", "text": "Burl Ives\n\nBurl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14, 1909 – April 14, 1995) was an American singer and actor of stage, screen, radio and television.\n\nHe began as an itinerant singer and banjoist, and launched his own radio show, \"The Wayfaring Stranger\", which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942 he appeared in Irving Berlin's \"This Is the Army\", and then became a major star of CBS radio. \nIn the 1960s he successfully crossed over into country music, recording hits such as \"A Little Bitty Tear\" and \"Funny Way of Laughing\". A popular film actor through the late 1940s and '50s, Ives's best-known roles in that medium included parts in \"So Dear to My Heart\" (1949) and \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958), as well as Rufus Hannassey in \"The Big Country\" (1958), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nIves is often remembered for his voice-over work as Sam the Snowman, narrator of the classic 1964 Christmas television special \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", which continues to air annually around Christmas.\n\nIves was born near Hunt City, an unincorporated town in Jasper County, Illinois, near Newton, to Levi \"Frank\" Ives (1880–1947) and Cordelia \"Dellie\" (née White) (1882–1954). He had six siblings: Audry, Artie, Clarence, Argola, Lillburn, and Norma. His father was first a farmer and then a contractor for the county and others. One day, Ives was singing in the garden with his mother, and his uncle overheard them. He invited his nephew to sing at the old soldiers' reunion in Hunt City. The boy performed a rendition of the folk ballad \"Barbara Allen\" and impressed both his uncle and the audience.\n\nFrom 1927 to 1929, Ives attended Eastern Illinois State Teachers College (now Eastern Illinois University) in Charleston, Illinois, where he played football. During his junior year, he was sitting in English class, listening to a lecture on \"Beowulf,\" when he suddenly realized he was wasting his time. As he walked out of the door, the professor made a snide remark, and Ives slammed the door behind him, shattering the window in the door. Sixty years later, the school named a building after its most famous dropout. Burl Ives was a member of Charleston Chapter of the Order of Demolay and is listed in the DeMolay Hall of Fame. Ives was also initiated into Scottish Rite Freemasonry in 1927. He was elevated to the 33rd and highest degree in 1987, and was later elected the Grand Cross.\n\nOn July 23, 1929, in Richmond, Indiana, Ives made a trial recording of \"Behind the Clouds\" for the Starr Piano Company's Gennett label, but the recording was rejected and destroyed a few weeks later. In later years Ives did not recall having made the record.\n\nIves traveled about the U.S. as an itinerant singer during the early 1930s, earning his way by doing odd jobs and playing his banjo. He was jailed in Mona, Utah, for vagrancy and for singing \"Foggy Dew\", which the authorities decided was a bawdy song. Around 1931, he began performing on WBOW radio in Terre Haute, Indiana. He also went back to school, attending classes at Indiana State Teachers College (now Indiana State University). In 1933, Ives also attended the Juilliard School in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1938 with a small role in Rodgers and Hart's hit musical, \"The Boys from Syracuse\". In 1939, he joined his friend and fellow actor Eddie Albert, who had the starring role in \"The Boys from Syracuse\", in Los Angeles. The two shared an apartment for a while in the Beachwood Canyon community of Hollywood.\n\nIn 1940, Ives named his own radio show \"The Wayfaring Stranger\" after one of his ballads. Over the next decade, he popularized several traditional folk songs, such as \"Foggy Dew\" (an English folk song), \"The Blue Tail Fly\" (an old minstrel tune now better known as \"Jimmy Crack Corn\"), and \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\" (an old hobo song). He was also associated with the Almanac Singers (Almanacs), a folk-singing group which at different times included Woody Guthrie, Will Geer, Millard Lampell, and Pete Seeger. The Almanacs were active in the American Peace Mobilization (APM), an antiwar group opposed to American entry into World War II and Franklin Roosevelt's pro-Allied policies. They recorded such songs as \"Get Out and Stay Out of War\" and \"Franklin, Oh Franklin\".\n\nIn June 1941, after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the APM reorganized itself into the pro-war American People's Mobilization. Ives and the Almanacs rerecorded several of their songs to reflect the group's new stance in favor of US entry into the war. Among them were \"Dear Mr. President\" and \"Reuben James\" (the name of a US destroyer sunk by the Germans before US entry into the war).\n\nIn early 1942, Ives was drafted into the U.S. Army. He spent time first at Camp Dix, then at Camp Upton, where he joined the cast of Irving Berlin's \"This Is the Army.\" He attained the rank of corporal. When the show went to Hollywood, he was transferred to the Army Air Force. He was discharged honorably, apparently for medical reasons, in September 1943. Between September and December 1943, Ives lived in California with actor Harry Morgan (who would later go on to play Officer Bill Gannon in the 1960s version of Jack Webb's TV show \"Dragnet\", and Colonel Sherman T. Potter on \"M*A*S*H\"). In December 1943, Ives went to New York to work for CBS radio for $100 a week. In 1944, he recorded \"The Lonesome Train\", a ballad about the life and death of Abraham Lincoln, written by Earl Robinson (music) and Lampell (lyrics).\n\nOn December 6, 1945, Ives married 29-year-old script writer Helen Peck Ehrlich. Their son Alexander was born in 1949.\n\nIn 1946, Ives was cast as a singing cowboy in the film \"Smoky\".\n\nIn 1947, Ives recorded one of many versions of \"The Blue Tail Fly\", but paired this time with the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne). The flip side of the record was a fast-paced \"I'm Goin' Down the Road\". Ives hoped the trio's success would help the record sell well, and indeed it did, becoming both a best-selling disc and a \"Billboard\" hit.\n\nHis version of the 17th-century English song \"Lavender Blue\" became his first hit and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for its use in the 1949 film \"So Dear to My Heart\".\n\nMusic critic John Rockwell said, \"Ives' voice ... had the sheen and finesse of opera without its latter-day Puccinian vulgarities and without the pretensions of operatic ritual. It was genteel in expressive impact without being genteel in social conformity. And it moved people\".\n\nIves was identified in the 1950 pamphlet \"Red Channels\" and blacklisted as an entertainer with supposed Communist ties. In 1952, he cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and agreed to testify, fearful of losing his source of income. Ives' statement to the HUAC ended his blacklisting, allowing him to continue acting in movies, but it also led to a bitter rift between Ives and many folk singers, including Pete Seeger, who accused Ives of naming names and betraying the cause of cultural and political freedom to save his own career. Forty-one years later, Ives, by then confined to a wheelchair, reunited with Seeger during a benefit concert in New York City, having reconciled years earlier. They sang \"Blue Tail Fly\" together.\n\nIves expanded his appearances in films during this decade. His movie credits include the role of Sam the Sheriff of Salinas, California, in \"East of Eden\", Big Daddy in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", roles in \"Desire Under the Elms\", \"Wind Across the Everglades\", \"The Big Country\", for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, \"Ensign Pulver\", the sequel to \"Mister Roberts\", and \"Our Man in Havana\", based on the Graham Greene novel.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ives began singing country music with greater frequency. In 1962, he released three songs that were popular with both country music and popular music fans: \"A Little Bitty Tear\", \"Call Me Mister In-Between\", and \"Funny Way of Laughing\".\n\nIves had several film and television roles during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1962, he starred with Rock Hudson in \"The Spiral Road,\" which was based on a novel of the same name by Jan de Hartog. He also starred in Disney's \"Summer Magic\" with Hayley Mills, Dorothy McGuire, and Eddie Hodges, and a score by Robert and Richard Sherman. In 1964, he played the genie in the movie \"The Brass Bottle\" with Tony Randall and Barbara Eden.\n\nIves' \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Silver and Gold\" became Christmas standards after they were first featured in the 1964 NBC-TV presentation of the Rankin/Bass stop-motion animated family special \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". Johnny Marks had composed the title song (originally an enormous hit for singing cowboy Gene Autry) in 1949, and producers Rankin and Bass retained him to compose the TV special's soundtrack. Ives voiced Sam the Snowman, the banjo-playing \"host\" and narrator of the story, explaining how Rudolph used his \"nonconformity\", as Sam refers to it, to save Christmas from being cancelled due to an impassable blizzard. The following year, Ives rerecorded all three of the Johnny Marks hits which he had sung in the TV special, but with a more \"pop\" feel. He released them all as singles for the 1965 holiday season, capitalizing on their previous success.\n\nIves performed in other television productions, including \"Pinocchio\" and \"Roots.\" He starred in two television series: \"O.K. Crackerby!\" (1965–66), which costarred Hal Buckley, Joel Davison, and Brooke Adams, and \"\" (1969–72). \"O.K. Crackerby!,\" which was about the presumed richest man in the world, replaced Walter Brennan's somewhat similar \"The Tycoon\" on the ABC schedule from the preceding year. Ives occasionally starred in macabre-themed productions. In 1970, for example, he played the title role in \"The Man Who Wanted to Live Forever,\" in which his character attempts to harvest human organs from unwilling donors. In 1972, he appeared as old man Doubleday in the episode \"The Other Way Out\" of Rod Serling's \"Night Gallery,\" in which his character seeks a gruesome revenge for the murder of his granddaughter.\n\nIves and Helen Peck Ehrlich were divorced in February 1971. Ives then married Dorothy Koster Paul in London two months later. In their later years, Ives and Dorothy lived in a waterfront home in Anacortes, Washington, in the Puget Sound area, and in Galisteo, New Mexico, on the Turquoise Trail. In the 1960s, he had another home just south of Hope Town on Elbow Cay, a barrier island of the Abacos in the Bahamas.\n\nIn honor of Ives' influence on American vocal music, on October 25, 1975, he was awarded the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. This award, initiated in 1964, was \"established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year who has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.\"\n\nWhen America Sings opened at Disneyland in 1974, Ives voiced the main host, Sam Eagle, an Audio-Animatronic.\n\nIves lent his name and image to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's \"This Land Is Your Land – Keep It Clean\" campaign in the 1970s. He was portrayed with the program's fictional spokesman, Johnny Horizon.\n\nBurl Ives was seen regularly in television commercials for Luzianne tea for several years during the 1970s and 1980s, when he was the company's commercial spokesman.\n\nIn 1989, Ives officially announced his retirement from show business on his 80th birthday. However, he continued to do occasional benefit concert performances on his own accord until 1993.\n\nIves was a pipe smoker. (The cover of his first album showed a pipe and a fishing hat with the words \"Burl Ives\" in between.) He also smoked cigars. In the summer of 1994, he was diagnosed with oral cancer. After several unsuccessful operations, he decided against further surgery. He fell into a coma and died from the disease on April 14, 1995, at the age of 85, at his home in Anacortes, Washington. He was buried in Mound Cemetery in Hunt City Township, Jasper County, Illinois.\n\nIves' Broadway career included appearances in \"The Boys from Syracuse\" (1938–39), \"Heavenly Express\" (1940), \"This Is the Army\" (1942), \"Sing Out, Sweet Land\" (1944), \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1951–52), and \"Dr. Cook's Garden\" (1967). His most notable Broadway performance (later reprised in a 1958 movie) was as \"Big Daddy\" Pollitt in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1955–56).\n\nIves' autobiography, \"The Wayfaring Stranger\", was published in 1948. He also wrote or compiled several other books, including \"Burl Ives' Songbook\" (1953), \"Tales of America\" (1954), \"Sea Songs of Sailing, Whaling, and Fishing\" (1956), and \"The Wayfaring Stranger's Notebook\" (1962).\n\nIves had a long-standing relationship with the Boy Scouts of America. He was a Lone Scout before that group merged with the Boy Scouts of America in 1924. The organization \"inducted\" Ives in 1966. He received the Boy Scouts' Silver Buffalo Award, its highest honor. The certificate for the award is on display at the Scouting Museum in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Ives often performed at the quadrennial Boy Scouts of America jamboree, including the 1981 jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia, where he shared the stage with the Oak Ridge Boys. There is a 1977 sound recording of Ives being interviewed by Boy Scouts at the National Jamboree at Moraine State Park, Pennsylvania. Ives was also the narrator of a 28-minute film about the 1977 National Jamboree. In the film, which was produced by the Boy Scouts of America, Ives \"shows the many ways in which Scouting provides opportunities for young people to develop character and expand their horizons.\"\n\nBurl Ives was inducted as a laureate of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state's highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1976 in the area of the performing arts.\n\nInducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in June 1994.\n\n"}

She was the daughter of the George Bruce (1781–1866), a famous type founder who was born in Edinburgh, and Catherine Wolfe (1785–1861), the daughter of David Wolfe (1748–1836) of New York City. Her brother was David Wolfe Bruce (1824–1895), who, along with David Wolfe Bishop, inherited the fortune of their cousin, Catharine Lorillard Wolfe.\n\nShe studied painting, learned Latin, German, French and Italian, and was familiar with the literature of those languages.\n\nIn 1890, she wrote and published a translation of the \"\"Dies Irae\".\" That same year, she returned to Heidelberg and began lecturing at the university as a privat-docent, essentially an unpaid instructor.\n\nDue to an ever-increasing illness, she was confined to her home and died on March 13, 1900 at 810 Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nIn 1877, she donated $50,000 for the construction of a library building and the purchase of books in memory of her father. The library, known as \"The George Bruce Library\" was completed in 1888 and was located at 226 West 42nd Street and designed by G. E. Harney. The building was sold in 1913 and the proceeds were used to build the current George Bruce library located on 125th Street in Harlem and designed by Carrère & Hastings.\n\nBruce made over 54 gifts to astronomy, totaling over $275,000, between 1889 and 1899.\n\nIn 1887, she donated the \"George Bruce Free Library\". Between 1889 and 1899 she donated funds to the Harvard College Observatory (U.S.A.), Yerkes Observatory (U.S.A.) and Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl (Germany), run by Max Wolf at the time, to buy new telescopes at each of those institutes.\n\nThe Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific is named after her, as well as the asteroid 323 Brucia, and the crater \"Bruce\" on the Moon.

The artwork consisted of them carrying a mattress wherever they went on campus during their final year at Columbia University. Sulkowicz said the piece would end when a student they alleged raped them in their dorm room in 2012 was expelled or otherwise left the university. The work was a protest against campus sexual assault and the university's handling of their sexual assault case, in which it had cleared the accused of responsibility.\nSulkowicz is the child of Sandra Leong and Kerry Sulkowicz, both psychiatrists from Manhattan, and is of Chinese, Japanese and Jewish descent. Sulkowicz attended Dalton School on the Upper East Side, where they were an A student and competitive fencer, and Columbia University, where they obtained a degree in visual arts in 2015. Sulkowicz is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.\n\nIn April 2013, Sulkowicz, then in the fourth year of their degree, filed a complaint with Columbia requesting the expulsion of fellow fourth-year student and German national, Paul Nungesser, alleging he had raped them in Sulkowicz's dorm room on August 27, 2012. Nungesser was found 'not responsible' by a university inquiry. In May 2014, Sulkowicz filed a report against Nungesser with the New York Police Department (NYPD), which did not pursue charges. The district attorney's office interviewed Sulkowicz and Nungesser, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion. Sulkowicz declined to pursue criminal charges further, saying it would be too draining and that NYPD officers were dismissive and had mistreated them. Sulkowicz subsequently focused their senior thesis on a work of performance art entitled \"Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)\". The performance and the allegations received considerable media attention, with Sulkowicz becoming known as \"Mattress Girl\".\nIn April 2015, Nungesser filed a Title IX gender discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor Jon Kessler, alleging their negligence in preventing him from being harassed. In the complaint, Nungesser stated Sulkowicz's allegation of rape was false, citing as evidence Sulkowicz's counterintuitive behavior, such as friendly texts Sulkowicz sent Nungesser days after the alleged attack occurred. The complaint argued Sulkowicz's allegation was made in response to unreciprocated desire for a serious relationship, therefore allowing the performance was harassment and a violation of his student rights. When questioned about the lawsuit, Sulkowicz said that it was \"full of lies.\" Federal District Court Judge Gregory H. Woods dismissed the lawsuit but allowed Nungesser to refile an amended suit, which was settled by Columbia in July 2017 under undisclosed terms.\n\nSulkowicz created \"Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)\" in the summer of 2014 for their senior thesis while at Yale University Summer School of Art and Music. This performance artwork was in protest against campus sexual assault and the university's handling of Sulkowicz's allegation that a fellow student at Columbia University anally raped them. The university cleared the student of responsibility, and the district attorney's office declined to pursue criminal charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion.\n\nTheir first effort was a video of them dismantling a bed, accompanied by the audio of them filing the police report, which they had recorded on their cellphone. The mattress later became the sole focus of the piece. Sulkowicz told \"New York\" magazine:\n\nThe , dark-blue, extra-long twin mattress used in the performance art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which they allege they were raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: written on the walls of their studio in the university's Watson Hall, these stated that they must carry the mattress whenever they were on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz was not there; and that they were not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help was offered they may accept it. In September that year they began carrying it on campus, which they said was a physically painful experience.\n\nSulkowicz's final thesis show, the week before graduation in May 2015, included depictions of a naked man with an obscenity and a couple having sex, printed onto a \"New York Times\" article about the student they accused. Sulkowicz said that the images were cartoons, and asked: \"what are the functions of cartoons? Do they depict the people themselves (a feat which, if you've done enough reading on art theory, you will realize is impossible), or do they illustrate the stories that have circulated about a person?\" This work was later shown under the title \"Newspaper Bodies (Look, Mom, I'm on the Front Page!)\" as part of a group exhibition at the Southampton Arts Center, Southampton, New York.\n\nOn June 3, 2015, Sulkowicz, working with artist Ted Lawson, released \"Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol\" (\"This is not a rape\"), an eight-minute video of Sulkowicz having sex with an anonymous actor in a Columbia dorm room. The title of the piece is a reference to the caption in René Magritte's \"The Treachery of Images\": \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\". Introductory text by Sulkowicz stresses that the sex was consensual throughout, though toward the end it portrays resistance, violence and force. When the video was first posted, each screen displayed the timestamp of August 27, 2012, the night of the alleged assault, but later the date was blurred. Sulkowicz wrote that the work, which examines the nature of sexual consent, was not a reenactment of the alleged rape and later stated that it was a separate piece from \"Mattress Performance\".\n\nFrom February to March 2016 at Coagula Curatorial in Los Angeles, Sulkowicz exhibited a piece, \"Self-Portrait\". For the first three weeks of the exhibition, Sulkowicz stood on a pedestal in the gallery, and had one-on-one conversations with visitors who would stand on an identical pedestal in front of them. The exhibition also featured a life size robotic replica of the artist that was called \"Emmatron\". Emmatron plays prerecorded answers to several questions Sulkowicz has been repeatedly asked that they will no longer respond to. A few examples of questions Emmatron had answers to included \"Tell me about the night you were assaulted\", \"Is this art piece a part of \"Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)\"?\" and \"What do your parents think of all this?\" If audience members asked these questions to Sulkowicz during their conversation, the artist would send them to Emmatron for the answers.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, Sulkowicz was documented protesting at two New York City museums and a subway station. During the protest, Sulkowicz posed for several photographs in front of Chuck Close paintings at The Museum of Modern Art and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, a Close mosaic in a subway station, as well as in front of Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\". Sulkowicz wore black lingerie, with home-made pasties made of tape, and covered their body with drawn-on asterisks. Sulkowicz stated that the protest was a response to a \"New York Times\" article from 28 January, in which members of the art world, responding to allegations of sexual harassment towards artist Chuck Close, debated over the future of art created by individuals accused of improper behavior. Among the people quoted in the article was Jock Reynolds, the then-director of the Yale University Art Gallery, who stated, \"Pablo Picasso was one of the worst offenders of the 20th century in terms of his history with women. Are we going to take his work out of the galleries? At some point you have to ask yourself, is the art going to stand alone as something that needs to be seen?\" Sulkowicz was reportedly \"appalled\" by the comments, asking, \"are you only showing work by Harvey Weinstein?\" The protest was described as a \"performance\" in the media, and as \"performative action\" by the artist.\n\nFrom March 10 to April 22, 2018, The Invisible Dog gallery in Brooklyn, New York hosted Sulkowicz' first gallery installation, a piece entitled \"The Floating World\". Inspired by the culture of Japan during the Edo period, the piece consists of a series of glass orbs, suspended by ropes, containing objects of personal significance to Sulkowicz and members of their community.\n\n"}

Between 1963 and 1976 he was a driving force in developing elite handball in the Faroe Islands.\n\nMortensen was born and raised in Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. He is the son of business owners Niels Gustav Mortensen (1913 – 1987) and Ebba Mortensen (1920 – 2000), who each ran trading businesses in one of the older trading quarters of Tórshavn between 1952 and 1990. In 1964, he married Birgit Mortensen (née Sivertsen), and together they had a daughter, Elisabeth Mortensen and a son, Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen took over as CEO of SMS after his father stepped down from the position in 1996, and as a member of its board after Mortensen retired in 2007. After being a widower since 2001, Mortensen remarried in 2007 with Marjun á Plógv.\n\nAfter completing primary and secondary school, Mortensen received his Upper Secondary diploma from Føroya Millum- og Realskúli and took on an apprenticeship at Føroya Banki (now BankNordik). In 1967, Mortensen graduated from the Niels Brock business school in Copenhagen and shortly after started working at the Magasin du Nord department store on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. After two years at the department store, Mortensen returned to the Faroe Islands to found his own business and improve the lagging business conditions in the country.\n\nMortensen’s life-long commitment to Faroese elite handball began in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1963, at the age of 18, Mortensen became the president of the Tórshavn handball club Neistin and immediately initiated the construction of a club venue, completed in the following year. The venue was crucial to the club’s subsequent popularity and success. In 1964, Mortensen played on the first Faroese men’s national handball team. In 1976, Mortensen was head coach for the men’s national handball team when they achieved good results during the Men’s Handball World Championship 1976 Group C in Portugal.\n\nAfter completing his education in Denmark, Mortensen ran his own retail business in his parents’ premises in central Tórshavn. But in 1970, Mortensen organised the first of many trade fairs in the Faroe Islands. A few attempts had been made earlier at arranging similar events in 1968 in Klaksvík. The popularity of the trade fairs showed that demand for the Faroese market was bigger than the market was capable of supplying at the time.\n\nMost businesses were located in central Torshavn, and increasing traffic and construction was causing congestion. Tórshavn's city council was therefore planning to establish a shopping street as an extension of a new pharmacy at the outskirts of the city centre to divert some of the traffic.\n\nUpon learning of the city plans and the reasons behind them, Mortensen suggested privatising the project in order to further promote business. After initial internal disputes, Mortensen was granted permission to build his department store, which would enable customers to run various errands in a single location.\n\nMortensen hired Danish architect Flemming Hansen to design a progressive department store, whose architecture would still be rooted in traditional Faroese building style. Construction began in 1976, and the department store SMS opened to the public on November 2nd, 1977. Mortensen was CEO of SMS from 1976 to 1996 and majority shareholder until 2007, when he sold all his shares to his son Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen has since then developed the business further. Today the SMS Group includes three shopping centers, three chain stores, a number of partnerships and a microbiological laboratory.\n\nMortensen’s visions have been characterised by both progressiveness and traditionalism. The department store SMS was designed to resemble traditional Faroese boathouses, and Faroese shop names and business terminology was developed by taking into account common citizen and customer opinions, often through public naming competitions. Over time, the previous predominately Danish business terminology was replaced by newly created Faroese terminology, which continues to evolve with the introduction of new terms and technology.\n\nIn an effort to combine innovation with historic preservation, Mortensen collaborated with architects Gunnar Hoydal, Mette Skjold, and Ósbjørn Jacobsen in 2012 to create a public proposal on how to continue developing the Tórshavn city centre while maintaining its historic features.\n\nOn International Mother Language Day in 2015, Mortensen received the Faroese Mother Language Award for his longstanding contribution to society and language, particularly his innovative approaches to Faroese trade and business.\n\n"}

{"id": "4662368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4662368", "title": "Hipparchia of Maroneia", "text": "Hipparchia of Maroneia\n\nHipparchia of Maroneia (; ; fl. c. 325 BC) was a Cynic philosopher, and wife of Crates of Thebes. She was born in Maroneia, but her family moved to Athens, where Hipparchia came into contact with Crates, the most famous Cynic philosopher in Greece at that time. She fell in love with him, and, despite the disapproval of her parents, she married him. She went on to live a life of Cynic poverty on the streets of Athens with her husband.\n\nLittle survives of her own philosophical views, but like most Cynics, her influence lies in the example of her life, choosing a way of life which was usually considered unacceptable for respectable women of the time. The story of her attraction to Crates, and her rejection of conventional values, became a popular theme for later writers.\n\nHipparchia was born c. 350 BC in Maroneia, Thrace. Her family came to Athens, where Hipparchia's brother, Metrocles, became a pupil of the Cynic philosopher Crates of Thebes. Hipparchia fell in love with Crates, and developed such a passion for him, that she told her parents that if they refused to allow her to marry him, she would kill herself. They begged Crates to dissuade her, and he stood before her, removed his clothes, and said, \"Here is the bridegroom, and this is his property.\" Hipparchia, however, was quite happy with this; she adopted the Cynic life assuming the same clothes that he wore, and appearing with him in public everywhere. Crates called their marriage \"dog-coupling\" (\"cynogamy\"). We are told that they lived in the stoas and porticoes of Athens, and the Latin-language writer Apuleius wrote a dubious account of them having sex, publicly, in broad daylight. Although this would have been consistent with Cynic shamelessness (\"anaideia\"), the mere fact that Hipparchia adopted male clothes and lived on equal terms with her husband would have been enough to shock Athenian society. Hipparchia had at least two children, a daughter, and a son named Pasicles. It is not known how or when she died. There is an epigram ascribed to Antipater of Sidon, as to what may have been written on her tomb:\n<poem>\nI, Hipparchia chose not the tasks of rich-robed woman, but the manly life of the Cynic.\nBrooch-clasped tunics, well-clad shoes, and perfumed headscarves pleased me not;\nBut with wallet and fellow staff, together with coarse cloak and bed of hard ground,\nMy name shall be greater than Atalanta: for wisdom is better than mountain running.</poem>\nThe \"Suda\" says she wrote some philosophical treatises, and some letters addressed to Theodorus the Atheist. None of these have survived. There are some accounts of her encounters with Theodorus:\nWhen she went into a symposium with Crates, she tested Theodoros the atheist by proposing a sophism like this: \"That which if Theodoros did, he would not be said to do wrong, neither should Hipparchia be said to do wrong if she does it. Theodoros hitting himself does not do wrong, nor does Hipparchia do wrong hitting Theodoros.\" He did not reply to what she said, but pulled up her garment.\nWe are told she was neither offended nor ashamed by this \"as most women would have been.\" We are also told that when Theodorus (quoting a line from \"The Bacchae\" of Euripides) said to her:\n\"Who is the woman who has left behind the shuttles of the loom?\" she replied\nI, Theodorus, am that person, but do I appear to you to have come to a wrong decision, if I devote that time to philosophy, which I otherwise should have spent at the loom?\"\nMany other anecdotes existed about Hipparchia, but they have been mostly lost. We know also that Crates taught Zeno of Citium; it is impossible to say what influence Hipparchia had on Zeno in his development of Stoicism, but Zeno's own radical views on love and sex (as evidenced in his \"Republic\") may have been influenced by the relationship of Hipparchia and Crates.\n\nHipparchia's fame undoubtedly rests on the fact that she was a woman practising philosophy and living a life on equal terms with her husband. Both facts were unusual for ancient Greece or Rome. Although there were other women who chose to live as Cynics, Hipparchia is the only one whose name is known. She is also the only woman to have her own entry among the 82 philosophers in Diogenes Laërtius' \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\", and she continued to fascinate later writers. There are, for example, a set of \"Cynic epistles\", written in the 1st century AD, some of which purport to give advice from Crates to Hipparchia:\nOur philosophy is called Cynic not because we are indifferent to everything, but because we aggressively endure what others, due to being soft or general opinion find unbearable. So it is for this reason and not the former that they have called us Cynics. Stay, therefore, and continue as a Cynic—for you are not by nature worse than we [men] are, for neither are female dogs worse than male—in order that you might be freed from Nature, as all [people] either because of law or due to vices, live as slaves.\n\nOther letters mention events, which, like a lot of the \"Cynic epistles\", may be based on actual anecdotes which existed at the time. In two of the letters, we are told that Hipparchia sent a cloak to Crates which she had made. Crates, though, fears that she may have undertaken the task \"so that you might appear to the masses to be someone who loves her husband.\" Crates urges her to renounce wool-spinning and take-up philosophy since that is the reason she married him. In another letter, Crates learns why she has taken up domestic tasks: Hipparchia, we are told, has given birth. After agreeing with her that she gave birth easily because of her Cynic training, Crates proceeds to give advice on how to rear the child:\nLet his bath water be cold, his clothes be a cloak, his food be milk, yet not to excess. Rock him in a cradle made from a tortoise shell. ... When he is able to speak and walk, dress him, not with a sword, as Aethra did with Theseus, but with a staff and cloak and wallet, which can guard men better than swords, and send him to Athens.\n\nPerhaps most remarkable is a letter purporting to come from Diogenes of Sinope addressed to the people of Maroneia:\nYou did well when you changed the name of the city and, instead of Maroneia, called it Hipparchia, its present name, since it is better for you to be named after Hipparchia, a woman, it's true, but a philosopher, than after Maron, a man who sells wine.\nThere is, unfortunately, no evidence that the people of Maroneia ever renamed their city Hipparchia.\n\nThe story of Hipparchia's pursuit of Crates, despite the disapproval of her parents and the initial reluctance of Crates, was a popular tale from the 16th century onwards. It featured in Lodovico Guicciardini's commonplace book \"Hore di ricreatione\" published in 1568, and it was one of the stories told by the Dutch poet Jacob Cats in his \"Touchstone of the Wedding Ring\" (\"Proefsteen van de Trou-ringh\") published in 1637. William Penn wrote about her in his \"No Cross, No Crown\", which he wrote in prison in 1668. For Penn she was an example of puritan discipline and virtue:\n\nHer marriage to Crates inspired Pierre Petit to write the Latin poem \"Cynogamia, sive de Cratetis et Hipparches amoribus\" in 1676. In the same century, Clemenza Ninci, an Italian nun, wrote a play entitled \"Sposalizio d'Iparchia filosofa\" (\"The marriage of Hipparchia the philosopher\"). The play deals with Hipparchia's desire to marry Crates, and the obstacles which are placed in her way until she achieves her desire. The play was written for convent performance (with all the parts played by nuns) and was not published until the 19th century. The German writer Christoph Martin Wieland made Crates and Hipparchia the heroes of his epistolary novel \"Krates und Hipparchia\" (1804). Crates and Hipparchia feature in Marcel Schwob's \"Vies Imaginaires\" (\"Imaginary Lives\", 1896). The American writer H.D. wrote a novella \"Hipparchia\" (1921), a highly fictionalised account of Hipparchia's daughter, (whom H.D. imagines is also called Hipparchia). Hipparchia was an inspiration for the book \"L'Étude et le rouet\" (1989) (translated in English under the title \"Hipparchia's Choice\") by the French feminist philosopher Michèle Le Dœuff, a reflection on women's relation to philosophy. Martha Nussbaum, in her speech to the University of Chicago Law School graduating class of 2010, presented Hipparchia'a life as an illustrative example of the benefits of continuing education beyond academic settings.\n\nA genus of butterflies, \"Hipparchia\", bears her name.\n\n\n"}

In March 1822, he was in Makrynoros where he joined the forces of Gennaios Kolokotronis who had arrived from the Peloponnese. On September 13, 1825 he entered in the beleaguered Messolonghi. After the fall of Messolonghi, he went to Nafplio where he was appointed as a garrison commander of the castle Iç Kale (along with Athanasios Fotomaras) as an offset for the occupation of Palamidi from Theodoros Grivas, with whom he was in controversy despite the fact that they were cousins. In 1827 he was involved in an armed conflict with Grivas and the consequence was the cannon fire between the two fortresses and the lethal street fighting in Nafplio. The result of this conflict was the death or injuring of 50 people. Meanwhile, Stratos’ men captured several residents, including Anagnostis and Kanellos Deligiannis. These conflicts caused sad impression on foreigners who were during that time in Nafplio.\n\nOn July 21, 1827, Stratos handed the fortress to Velissarios Kalogeros and occupied areas outside the city of Nafplio, which were suggested to him by the government.

{"id": "1930927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930927", "title": "John Christie (murderer)", "text": "John Christie (murderer)\n\nJohn Reginald Halliday Christie (8 April 1899 – 15 July 1953), known to his family and friends as Reg Christie, was an English serial killer and necrophile active during the 1940s and early 1950s. He murdered at least eight people – including his wife, Ethel – by strangling them in his flat at 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill, London. Christie moved out of Rillington Place during March 1953; soon afterward the bodies of three of his victims were discovered hidden in a wallpaper-covered alcove in the kitchen. Two further bodies were discovered in the garden, and his wife's body was found beneath the floorboards of the front room. Christie was arrested and convicted of his wife's murder, for which he was hanged.\n\nTwo of Christie's victims were Beryl Evans and her baby daughter Geraldine, who, along with Beryl's husband, Timothy Evans, were tenants at 10 Rillington Place during 1948–49. This case sparked huge controversy after Timothy Evans was charged with both murders, found guilty of the murder of his daughter and hanged in 1950. Christie was a major prosecution witness; when his own crimes were discovered three years later, serious doubts were raised about the integrity of Evans's conviction. Christie himself subsequently admitted killing Beryl Evans, but not Geraldine; it is now generally accepted that Christie murdered both Beryl and Geraldine and that police mishandling of the original inquiry, as well as their incompetence during searches at the house, allowed Christie to escape detection and enabled him to murder four more women. The High Court, when overturning the conviction in the Evans case during the 2000s, accepted that Evans did not murder either his wife or his child, and that a miscarriage of justice therefore occurred when Timothy Evans was hanged.\n\nIn an official inquiry conducted in 1965–66, Mr Justice (Sir Daniel) Brabin concluded that it was \"more probable than not\" that Evans killed his wife, but that he did not kill his daughter Geraldine. This finding, challenged in subsequent legal processes, enabled the Home Secretary to grant Evans a posthumous pardon for the murder of his daughter during October 1966. The case contributed to the 1965 suspension of capital punishment for murder in the United Kingdom.\n\nChristie was born in Northowram near Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Christie was the sixth in a family of seven children. He had a troubled relationship with his father, carpet designer Ernest John Christie, an austere and uncommunicative man who displayed little emotion towards his children and would punish them for trivial offences. He was also alternately coddled and bullied by his mother and older sisters.\n\nDuring his later life, Christie's childhood peers described him as \"a queer lad\" who \"kept himself to himself\" and \"was not very popular\". On 24 March 1911, his grandfather David Halliday died aged 75 in Christie's house after a long illness. Christie saw his Grandfather's dead body laid out on a trestle table and he said it didn't worry or perturb him.\n\nAt the age of 11, Christie won a scholarship to Halifax Secondary School where his favourite subject was mathematics, particularly algebra. He was also good at History and Woodwork It was later found he had an IQ of 128. He sang in the church choir and was a Boy Scout. After leaving school on 22 April 1913 he began a job as an assistant cinema projectionist.\n\nChristie had a lifelong problem with impotence; his first attempts at sex were failures, and he was branded \"Reggie-No-Dick\" and \"Can't-Do-It-Christie\" throughout adolescence. (Nevertheless, a post-mortem report confirmed Christie's genitals were physically normal.) His difficulties with sex remained throughout his life, and most of the time he could only perform with prostitutes. \n\nIn September 1916, Christie enlisted in the army; he was called up on 12 April 1917 to join the 52nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, to serve as an infantryman. In April 1918, the regiment was despatched to France, where Christie was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment as a signalman. That June, he was injured in a mustard gas attack and spent a month in a military hospital in Calais. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him blind and mute for three and a half years. His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to talk much louder than a whisper for the rest of his life. Ludovic Kennedy points out that no record of his blindness has been traced and that, while Christie may have lost his voice when he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute. His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argues, was a psychological reaction to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas. That reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying personality disorder that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to get attention and sympathy.\n\nHe was demobilised from the army on 22 October 1919.\n\nHe joined the RAF on 13 December 1923 but was discharged on 15 August 1924.\n\nChristie married Ethel Simpson from Sheffield at Halifax Register Office on 10 May 1920, but his problems with impotence remained, although he continued to visit prostitutes. Early in the marriage Ethel suffered a miscarrage.The couple moved to Sheffield, but separated after four years of marriage. Christie moved to London; he spent the next decade in and out of prison, while Ethel remained in Sheffield with her relatives. He was released from prison in January 1934, when the couple reunited and moved to Rillington Place.\n\nDuring the first decade of his marriage to Ethel, Christie was convicted of several criminal offences. He started work as a postman on 10 January 1921 in Halifax, and his first conviction was for stealing postal orders on 20 February and 26 March, for which he received three months' imprisonment on 12 April 1921. He served his sentence in Manchester prison and was released on 27 June. He was then convicted on 15 January 1923 of obtaining money on false pretences and of violent conduct, for which, respectively, he was bound over and put on 12 months' probation. He committed two further crimes of larceny during 1924, and received consecutive sentences of three and six months' imprisonment on 22 September 1924. On 13 May 1929, after working for over two years as a lorry driver Christie was convicted of assaulting a prostitute with whom he was living in Battersea and was sentenced to six months' hard labour; Christie had hit her over the head with a cricket bat, which the magistrate described as a \"murderous attack\". Finally, he was convicted of stealing a car from a priest who had befriended him, and was imprisoned for three months on 1 November 1933.\n\nChristie and Ethel were reconciled after his release from prison, but although he was able to end his recourse to petty crime, he continued to seek out prostitutes. In 1937, Christie and his wife moved into the top-floor flat of 10 Rillington Place in Notting Hill; then a rather run-down area of London. They moved into the ground-floor flat in December 1938. The house was a three-storey brick terrace; the ground and first floors contained a bedroom, living room and kitchen but the second-floor flat had no living room. Living conditions were \"squalid\" – the building's occupants had just one outside lavatory to share, and none of the flats had a bathroom. The street was close to an above-ground section of the Metropolitan line (now the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines), and the train noise would have been \"deafening\" for the occupants of 10 Rillington Place.\n\nAfter three years of working as a foreman at the Commodore Cinema in King Street, Hammersmith, at the beginning of the Second World War Christie applied to join the War Reserve Police and was accepted, despite his criminal record, as the authorities failed to check his records. He was assigned to the Harrow Road Police Station, where he met a woman called Gladys Jones with whom he began an affair. Their relationship lasted until mid-1943, when the woman's husband, a serving soldier, returned from the war. After learning of the affair, he went to the house where his wife was living, discovered Christie there, and assaulted him.\n\nChristie committed his murders over a ten-year-period between 1943-1953, usually by strangling his victims after he had rendered them unconscious with domestic gas; some he raped as they lay unconscious.\n\nThe first person Christie admitted to killing was Ruth Fuerst, a 21-year-old Austrian munitions worker who supplemented her income by occasionally engaging in prostitution. Christie claimed to have met Fuerst while she was soliciting clients in a snack bar in Ladbroke Grove. According to his own statements, on 24 August 1943, he invited Fuerst to his home to engage in sex (his wife was visiting relatives at the time). Afterwards, Christie impulsively strangled her on his bed with a length of rope. He initially stowed Fuerst's body beneath the floorboards of his living room, and buried her body in the back garden the following evening.\n\nSoon after the murder, at the end of 1943, Christie resigned as a Special Constable. The following year he found new employment as a clerk at an Acton radio factory. There he met his second victim, colleague Muriel Amelia Eady. On 7 October 1944, he invited Eady back to his flat with the promise that he had concocted a \"special mixture\" that could cure her bronchitis. Eady was to inhale the mixture from a jar with a tube inserted in the top. The mixture in fact was Friar's Balsam, which Christie used to disguise the smell of domestic gas. Once Eady was seated breathing the mixture from the tube with her back turned, Christie inserted a second tube into the jar connected to a gas tap. As Eady continued breathing she inhaled the domestic gas, which soon rendered her unconscious – domestic gas during the 1940s was coal gas, which had a carbon monoxide content of 15 percent. Once Eady was unconscious, Christie raped and then strangled her, before burying her body alongside Fuerst's in the back garden.\n\nDuring Easter of 1948, Timothy Evans and his wife Beryl moved into the top-floor flat at Rillington Place, where Beryl gave birth that October to their daughter, Geraldine. In late 1949, Evans informed police that his wife was dead. A police search of 10 Rillington Place failed to find her body, but a later search revealed the bodies of Beryl Evans, her daughter, Geraldine, and a 16-week-old male foetus in an outdoor wash-house. Beryl's body had been wrapped twice over in a blanket and then a table cloth. The post-mortem revealed that both mother and daughter had been strangled and that Beryl Evans had been physically assaulted before her death, shown by facial bruising. Evans at first claimed that Christie had killed his wife in a botched abortion operation, but police questioning eventually produced a confession. The alleged confession may have been fabricated by the police themselves, as the statement appears contrived and artificial. After being charged Evans withdrew his confession and once again accused Christie, this time of both murders.\n\nOn 11 January 1950, Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter, the prosecution having decided not to pursue a second charge of murdering his wife. Christie was a principal witness for the Crown: he denied Evans's accusations and gave detailed evidence about the quarrels between him and his wife. The jury found Evans guilty despite the revelation of Christie's criminal record of theft and violence, and, after an appeal on 20 February had failed, Evans was hanged at Pentonville Prison on 9 March 1950. Christie himself lost the job he had held for four years at the Post Office Savings Bank due to the disclosure of his criminal convictions at the trial.\n\nThe police made several mistakes in the handling of the case, especially in overlooking the remains of Christie's previous murder victims left in the garden at Rillington Place; one femur was later found propping up a fence. The garden of the property was very small, about , and the fence was parallel to the wash-house where the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine were later found. Several searches were made at the house after Evans confessed to placing his wife's remains in the drains, but the wash-house was not entered at any point by the three policemen conducting the search. The garden was apparently examined but was not excavated at this point. Christie later admitted that his dog had unearthed the skull of Muriel Eady in the garden shortly after these police searches, which he simply threw into an abandoned bombed-out house in nearby St. Marks Road. There was clearly no systematic search made of the crime scene, in which this or other human remains would have been found and pointed to Christie as the perpetrator. Several police searches of the property showed a complete lack of expertise in handling forensic evidence and were quite superficial, at best. Had the searches been conducted effectively, the investigation would have exposed Christie as a murderer, and the lives of four women, as well as Evans's, would have been saved.\n\nThe evidence of builders working at the house was ignored, and their various interviews with Evans suggest that the police concocted a false confession. It should have been clear, for example, from the very first statement made by Evans in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, on 30 November 1949, that he was totally unaware of the resting place of the body of his wife, or how she had been killed. He claimed that his wife's body was in either a manhole or a drain at the front of the house, but a police search failed to find any remains there. That in itself should have prompted a thorough search of the house, wash-house and garden, but no further action was taken until later, when the two bodies were found in the wash-house. Evans was also totally unaware at his first interview that his daughter had been killed. The police interrogation in London was mishandled from the start, when they showed him the clothes of his wife and baby and revealed that they had been found in the wash-house. Such information should have been kept from him so as to force him to tell police where the bodies had been concealed. The several apparent \"confessions\" contain questionable words and phrases in high-register language such as \"terrific argument\" which seem out of place for a distressed, uneducated, working-class young man such as Evans and bear no relation to what he probably said. These were almost certainly inventions made by the police, as Ludovic Kennedy pointed out, much later after the truth about Christie had emerged.\n\nThe police accepted all of Christie's statements as factual without any major scrutiny, and he was the crucial witness at the trial of Evans. As Kennedy noted, the police accepted the former war reserve policeman Christie as one of their own, and largely took what he said on face value without any further investigation.Bearing in mind Christie had criminal convictions for theft and malicious wounding (while Evans did not have any previous convictions for violence), the reliance on his testimony was questionable. It is significant that Christie had claimed to be an abortionist prior to his meeting the Evanses, having said so to a work colleague in 1947. He also repeated this claim after the Evans trial to women he spoke to in cafes, whom he possibly regarded as future potential victims. Such an approach aligns with Christie's \"modus operandi\" of offering help to women so as to gain their confidence and lure them back to his flat, as demonstrated in Muriel Eady's case.\n\nNearly three years passed without major incident for Christie after Evans's trial. Having lost his employment at the Post Office Savings Bank due to his criminal convictions being disclosed at Evans's trial, Christie found alternative employment as a clerk with the British Road Services at their Shepherd's Bush depot. At the same time, new tenants arrived to fill the vacant first- and second-floor rooms at 10 Rillington Place. The tenants were predominantly black immigrants from the West Indies; this horrified the Christies, who regarded their neighbours as inferior and disliked living with them. Tensions between the new tenants and the Christies came to a head when Ethel Christie prosecuted one of her neighbours for assault. Christie successfully negotiated with the Poor Man's Lawyer Centre to continue to have exclusive use of the back garden, ostensibly to have space between him and his neighbours but arguably to prevent anyone from uncovering the human remains buried there.\n\nOn the morning of 14 December 1952, Christie strangled Ethel in bed. She had last been seen in public two days earlier. Christie invented several stories to explain his wife's disappearance and to help mitigate the possibility of further inquiries being made. In reply to a letter from relatives in Sheffield, he wrote that Ethel had rheumatism and could not write herself; to one neighbour, he explained that she was visiting her relatives in Sheffield; to another, he said that she had gone to Birmingham. Christie had resigned from his job on 6 December and had been unemployed since then. To support himself, Christie sold Ethel's wedding ring, watch, and furniture. Every week he went to the Labour Exchange to collect his unemployment benefit. On 26 January 1953 he forged his wife's signature and emptied her bank account.\n\nBetween 19 January and 6 March 1953, Christie murdered three more women whom he had invited back to 10 Rillington Place: Kathleen Maloney, Rita Nelson and Hectorina MacLennan. Maloney was a prostitute from the Ladbroke Grove area. Nelson was from Belfast and was visiting her sister in Ladbroke Grove when she met Christie. She was six months pregnant at the time of her murder. Christie first met MacLennan, who was living in London with her boyfriend, Alex Baker, in a café. All three met on several occasions after this, and Christie let MacLennan and Baker stay at Rillington Place while they were looking for accommodation. On another occasion, Christie met MacLennan on her own and persuaded her to come back to his flat, where he murdered her. Later, he convinced Baker, who came to Rillington Place looking for MacLennan, that he had not seen her. Christie kept up the pretence for several days, meeting Baker regularly to see if he had news of her whereabouts and to help him search for her.\n\nFor the murders of his final three victims, Christie modified the gassing technique he had first used on Muriel Eady; he simply used a rubber tube connected to the gas pipe in the kitchen which he kept closed off with a bulldog clip. He seated his victims in the kitchen, released the clip on the tube, and let gas leak into the room. The Brabin Report pointed out that Christie's explanation of his gassing technique was not satisfactory because he would have been overpowered by the gas as well. Nevertheless, it was established that all three victims had been exposed to carbon monoxide. The gas made his victims drowsy, after which Christie strangled them with a length of rope.\n\nAs with Eady, Christie repeatedly raped his last three victims while they were unconscious and continued to do so as they died. When this aspect of his crimes was publicly revealed, Christie quickly gained a reputation for being a necrophiliac. One commentator, however, has cautioned against categorising Christie as such; according to the accounts Christie gave to the police, he did not engage sexually with any of his victims exclusively after death. After Christie had murdered each of his final victims by ligature strangulation, he placed a vest or other cloth-like material between their legs before wrapping their semi-naked bodies in blankets (in a similar manner to the way in which Beryl Evans's body had been wrapped), before stowing their bodies in a small alcove behind the back kitchen wall. He later covered the entrance to this alcove with wallpaper.\n\nChristie moved out of 10 Rillington Place on 20 March 1953, after fraudulently sub-letting his flat to a couple from whom he took £7 13s 0d (£7.65 or about £ as of ). The landlord visited that same evening and, finding the couple there instead of Christie, demanded that they leave first thing the next morning. The landlord then allowed the tenant of the top-floor flat, Beresford Brown, to use Christie's kitchen. On 24 March, Brown discovered the kitchen alcove when he attempted to insert brackets into the wall to hold a wireless set. Peeling back the wallpaper, Brown saw the bodies of Maloney, Nelson and MacLennan. After getting confirmation from another tenant in 10 Rillington Place that they were dead bodies, Brown informed the police and a citywide search for Christie began.\n\nAfter he left Rillington Place, Christie went to a Rowton House in King's Cross, where he booked a room for seven nights under his real name and address. He stayed for only four nights, leaving on 24 March when news of the discovery at his flat broke, after which he wandered around London, spending much of his time in cafés. On the morning of 31 March Christie was arrested on the embankment near Putney Bridge after being challenged about his identity by a police officer; all he had in his possession were some coins and an old newspaper clipping about the remand of Timothy Evans.\n\nWhile in custody, Christie confessed to seven murders: the three women found in the kitchen alcove, his wife, and the two women buried in the back garden. He also admitted being responsible for the murder of Beryl Evans, which Timothy Evans had originally been charged with during the police investigation in 1949, although for the most part he denied killing Geraldine Evans. However, on one occasion following his trial, Christie indicated that he may have been responsible for her death as well, having said so to a hospital orderly. It is speculated that Christie would not have wanted to readily admit his guilt in Geraldine's death in order to not lose all respect from the jury and for his own safety from his fellow inmates.\n\nChristie was tried only for the murder of his wife Ethel. His trial began on 22 June 1953, in the same court in which Evans had been tried three years earlier. Christie pleaded insanity and claimed to have a poor memory of the events. Dr. Matheson, a doctor at Brixton Prison who evaluated Christie, was called as a witness by the prosecution. He testified that Christie had a hysterical personality but was not insane. The jury rejected Christie's plea, and after deliberating for 85 minutes found him guilty. Christie did not appeal against his conviction, and on 15 July 1953 he was hanged at Pentonville Prison. His executioner was Albert Pierrepoint, who had previously hanged Evans. After being pinioned for execution, Christie complained that his nose itched. Pierrepoint assured him that \"It won't bother you for long\".\n\nThere is a waxwork model of Christie's hanging in the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's, London.\n\n\nBased on the pubic hair that Christie collected from his victims, it has been speculated that he was responsible for more murders than those carried out at 10 Rillington Place. Christie claimed that the four different clumps of hair in his collection came from his wife and the three bodies discovered in the kitchen alcove, but only one matched the hair type on those bodies, Ethel Christie's. Even if two of the others had come from the bodies of Fuerst and Eady, which had by then decomposed into skeletons, there was still one remaining clump of hair unaccounted for—it could not have come from Beryl Evans, as no pubic hair had been removed from her body.\n\nWriting in 1978 Professor Keith Simpson, one of the pathologists involved in the forensic examination of Christie's victims, had this to say about the pubic hair collection:\n\nHowever, no attempts were or have been made to trace any further victims of Christie, such as examining records of missing women in London during his period of activity. In his 1995 book \"The Two Killers of Rillington Place\" John Eddowes, son of lawyer Michael Eddowes, suggested that Christie had been in a perfect position, as a special police constable during the war, to have committed many more murders than have been discovered.\n\nFollowing Christie's conviction there was substantial controversy concerning the earlier trial of Evans, who had been convicted mainly on the evidence of a serial killer living in the same property in which Evans had allegedly carried out his crimes. Christie confessed to Beryl Evans' murder and although he neither confessed to, nor was charged with, Geraldine Evans' murder, he was widely considered guilty of both murders at the time. This, in turn, cast doubt on the fairness of Evans' trial and raised the possibility that an innocent person had been hanged.\n\nThe controversy prompted the then Home Secretary, David Maxwell-Fyfe, to commission an inquiry led by John Scott Henderson, QC, the Recorder of Portsmouth, to determine whether Evans had been innocent of his crimes and if a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Scott Henderson interviewed Christie before his execution, as well as another twenty witnesses who had been involved in either of the police investigations. He concluded that Evans was in fact guilty of both murders and that Christie's confessions to the murder of Beryl Evans were unreliable and made in the context of furthering his own defence that he was insane.\n\nFar from ending the matter, questions continued to be raised in Parliament concerning Evans's innocence, along with newspaper campaigns and books being published making similar claims. The Scott Henderson Inquiry was criticised for being held over too short a time period (one week) and for being prejudiced against the possibility that Evans was innocent. This controversy, along with the coincidence that two stranglers would have been living in the same property at the same time if Evans and Christie had both been guilty, kept alive the issue that a miscarriage of justice had taken place in Evans's trial.\n\nThis uncertainty led to a second inquiry, chaired by High Court judge, Sir Daniel Brabin, which was conducted over the winter of 1965–66. Brabin re-examined much of the evidence from both cases and evaluated some of the arguments for Evans's innocence. His conclusions were that it was \"more probable than not\" that Evans had killed his wife but not his daughter Geraldine, for whose death Christie was responsible. Christie's likely motive was that her continued presence would have drawn attention to Beryl's disappearance, which Christie would have been averse to as it increased the risk that his own murders would be discovered. Brabin also noted, however, that the uncertainty involved in the case would have prevented a jury from being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Evans's guilt had he been re-tried. These conclusions were used by the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, to recommend a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, which was granted, as Evans had been tried and executed for the murder of his daughter. Jenkins announced the granting of Evans's pardon to the House of Commons on 18 October 1966. It allowed authorities to return Evans's remains to his family, who had him reburied in a private grave.\n\nThere was already debate in the United Kingdom over the continued use of the death penalty in the legal system. The controversy generated by Evans's case, along with a number of other controversial cases from the same time, contributed to the 1965 suspension, and subsequent abolition, of capital punishment in the United Kingdom for murder.\n\nIn 1954, the year after Christie's execution, Rillington Place was renamed Ruston Close, but number 10 continued in multiple occupation. The three families living there in 1970 refused to move out for the shooting of the 1971 film \"10 Rillington Place\", which was therefore filmed in the empty number 6. The house and street were demolished later, and the area has changed beyond all recognition. Bartle Road, London W11, now approximates the line of Rillington Place, and a small garden occupies the site where No. 10 once stood.\n\nIn January 2003 the Home Office awarded Timothy Evans's half-sister, Mary Westlake, and his sister, Eileen Ashby, \"ex-gratia\" payments as compensation for the miscarriage of justice in Timothy Evans's trial. The independent assessor for the Home Office, Lord Brennan QC, accepted that \"the conviction and execution of Timothy Evans for the murder of his child was wrongful and a miscarriage of justice\" and that \"there is no evidence to implicate Timothy Evans in the murder of his wife. She was most probably murdered by Christie.\" Lord Brennan believed that the Brabin Report's conclusion that Evans probably murdered his wife should be rejected given Christie's confessions and conviction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He invented a \"sliding breech\" repeating rifle also called a Harmonica gun between 1834 and 1842 while living in Quincy, Illinois. He achieved success with the Harmonica gun, and he received many orders. It is estimated that each Harmonica gun took 2 weeks to make, and Browning sold the guns for twenty-four dollars.\n\nWith his local prominence in Quincy, Browning was elected the justice of the peace. He came to know a young lawyer by the name of Abraham Lincoln who was an overnight guest in his home on at least two occasions.\n\nIn October 1838, Governor Lilburn Boggs issued the Extermination Order that caused the followers of Joseph Smith to flee Missouri. In his capacity as a judge, Browning came into contact with many of the Latter-day Saint exiles. Curious about the new settlement in the swampy lands of Nauvoo, Illinois, Browning paid a visit to Nauvoo. His meeting with church president Joseph Smith led Browning to convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.. His conversion led to him being ostracized by the community in Quincy. Browning sold his gun shop and land in Quincy.\n\nBrowning moved to Nauvoo, Illinois and joined the LDS community in 1840, where, in 1843, he briefly established a gun shop. A year later, LDS leader Joseph Smith was assassinated, and Browning was among the group which later fled Nauvoo.\n\nGuns that Browning produced as a Mormon gunsmith were labeled \"Holiness to the Lord - Our Preservation.\" The Jonathan Browning Home and Gunshop built in 1842 was restored during the 1960s. Registered with The Mormon Historic Sites Foundation, the museum is open to the public at no charge.\n\nBrowning fled Illinois with Brigham Young in late 1846 to escape religious persecution. He settled in the temporary community of Council Bluffs, Iowa (then called Kanesville in honor of Thomas L. Kane) and repaired guns for the local settlers who were migrating to Utah. He was awaiting Brigham Young to invite him to join the main body of settlers in Utah. When the Mormon Battalion was formed during the War with Mexico, Browning wanted to join them, but was told by Young that his skills would not be needed by the soldiers as much as they would by the main body of pioneers in Kanesville.\n\nAs was common in the community at that time, Jonathan Browning was a polygamist, having taken three wives. He fathered 24 children; prominent among them was the gun designer, John Moses Browning, one of the most important figures in the development of modern automatic and semi-automatic firearms.\n\nBrowning received the word from Brigham Young to join the main party of settlers in 1852. He left his gunshop in Iowa July 8, 1852 and migrated across the Rocky Mountains as the captain of the Henry W. Miller Company. He arrived October 2, 1852, with six wagons and six hundred dollars in the Salt Lake Valley. Browning moved to Ogden, Utah and established a gun shop there. His activities were limited to repairs in the Ogden shop, however. His son John Moses recalled, \"We ridiculed some of the guns we fixed, and I damned some of them when Pappy wasn't near, but it never occurred to us to make better ones. He was too old, and I was too young.\" Browning died June 21, 1879 in Ogden.\n\n\n"}

Morris was also named NSCAA Washington State Player of the Year and NSCAA High School All-American in 2012.\n\nHe joined the Sounders FC youth academy and played in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy for one season. On February 6, 2012, Morris signed a letter of intent to play college soccer at Stanford University.\n\nIn his freshman year with the Cardinal, Morris appeared in all 21 matches and led all Pac-12 freshman with seven assists and 19 points and tied for the lead with six goals and helped lead his team to their first NCAA Tournament since 2009 where they would eventually fall 1–0 to #2 seed Washington in the Round of 16. He went on to be named first team All-Pac-12 that year. Morris also spent time with Seattle Sounders FC U-23 in the Premier Development League.\n\nIn his sophomore year, Morris helped lead Stanford to its first Pac-12 championship since 2001.\n\nIn his junior year, Morris scored 13 goals and had 3 assists. He led the Cardinal to both the Pac-12 and the NCAA Championships. In the NCAA tournament, Morris scored 5 of Stanford's total of 12 goals. In the championship game against Clemson, Morris scored his first of two goals in the game only 87 seconds into the contest.\n\nOn January 8, 2016, Morris was awarded the Hermann Trophy as the best player in NCAA Division I soccer.\n\nAfter winning the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship, there was plenty of speculation that Morris would begin to play professionally. Coach Jürgen Klinsmann stated that Morris \"obviously has to\" turn pro. On January 5, 2016, Morris announced he decided to forgo his senior season at Stanford to turn pro. It was widely speculated that Morris would sign with the Sounders, the club for which his father works, and also holds his amateur rights. On January 21, 2016, Morris signed with Seattle Sounders FC. He joined the Sounders' preseason training camp in Arizona, debuting in a friendly against Celaya F.C. on February 9, 2016. On February 23, 2016, Morris made his professional debut against Club América in the CONCACAF Champions League, starting the match. The following week, he debuted in the Sounders' first Major League Soccer game of the season against Sporting Kansas City.\n\nMorris scored his first Major League Soccer goal for the Sounders on April 16, 2016, against the Philadelphia Union. He then went on to score in his next three consecutive games, matching the Seattle rookie scoring record, his next goal then surpassed the rookie goalscoring record which had been set by Steve Zakuani in 2009. He has since helped his team to win the MLS Cup after a run from ninth place into fourth, along with the help of Nicolas Lodeiro, a new midseason acquisition made by Seattle.\n\nOn February 22, 2018 while playing in El Salvador against Santa Tecla in the Sounders' first match of the 2018 CONCACAF Champions League, Morris collapsed untouched in the 85th minute with a torn ACL. He was reported to likely miss 6–9 months, with only a small chance of playing at all in the 2018 season.\n\nOn January 5, 2016, it was reported that Morris was set to train with SV Werder Bremen at their winter camp, which Bremen chief executive Thomas Eichin claimed was \"an opportunity for us to get to know the player better. Nothing more and nothing less\". On January 13, 2016, it was reported that Bremen extended the trial of Morris who then played in a friendly match against Inter Baku PIK and recorded an assist. On January 18, 2016, it was reported that Bremen had offered a contract to Morris, and Eichin claimed he was confident that they would sign him. However, it was later reported by Werder Bremen that Morris had turned down their offer in favor of playing in the United States.\n\nIn May 2013, Morris was one of 22 players named to the U.S. under-20 squad for the Toulon Tournament where he made three appearances. He also made appearances for the U.S. under-23 national team on August 6, 2014 and scored in a 5–1 win over Barbados.\n\nOn August 28, 2014, Morris received his first senior call up to the U.S. men's national team for a friendly against the Czech Republic, making him the first college player to be called into squad since Chris Albright was called up in 1999 while he was still playing at the University of Virginia. While he was left on the bench, he would make his international debut in a 4–1 defeat to Ireland in November.\n\nOn April 15, 2015, he scored his first U.S. men's national team goal against Mexico in an international friendly. In the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final, Morris scored the winning goal for the United States, assuring a victory over Jamaica and becoming joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals.\n\nMorris was born in Seattle, Washington to Michael and Leslie Morris. His father, Dr. Michael Morris, is the Chief Medical Director of Seattle Sounders FC. He has three siblings named Christopher, Julian and Talia. He attended Mercer Island High School, where he played high school soccer prior to joining the Sounders Academy.\n\nMorris was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of nine and is one of the few professional athletes with the condition to play. He said that having diabetes has helped shape him. His tattoo \"T1D\" on his inner arm is a tribute to the armband people with diabetes have to wear.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They have been translated and published in several countries including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, Holland, Denmark, Poland and Lithuania. His children’s book, In Search of the Light, was a winner of the Indie Excellence Book Award.\n\nHe is the founder of the Conscious Living Foundation, a registered non-profit organization established to support the awakening of human consciousness and to make his teachings widely available.\n\nAs a mark of honor and recognition to his selfless efforts in spiritual awakening, Religious Science International, a voluntary association that promotes Science of Mind, awarded Leonard Jacobson the Peace Prize in 2005.\n\nLeonard Jacobson was educated at the University of Melbourne, graduating with a law degree in 1969. He practiced law until 1979. He then set off on a long journey of spiritual discovery, which took him all over the world, from the United States to the Middle East, India, and Japan.\n\nJacobson teaches a two-step path of awakening. The first step involves learning the art of being present. The second involves becoming a master of your mind and ego. Both steps are necessary for true awakening.\n\"Jacobson’s message is that by learning the art of being fully present in the moment, it is possible to awaken now.\" In an interview with The Edge Magazine, he states, \"to be awake is as simple as being fully present in the moment of now. If you’re fully present with something that’s actually here in the moment with you, your mind will fall silent, thoughts will stop, and you’ll be awake in the truth of life.\" \n\nOne of the most differentiating aspects of Jacobson’s teaching is his practical approach to integrating awakened consciousness into everyday life and relationships. He is described as having a unique insight into the nature of the mind and ego. Jacobson emphasizes that the process of awakening must involve a recognition of what the ego is, its role and purpose, how it functions, and how to overcome its resistance.\n\nJacobson is sometimes referred to as a non-dual spiritual teacher. His teachings have been compared to those of Eckhart Tolle.\n\n\n\n"}

On 19 December 1919 he was killed in a gun battle during an ambush at Ashtown, near the border of County Meath and County Dublin, during the early stages of the Irish War of Independence.\n\nSavage was born in Streamstown, Ballisodare, County Sligo on 12 October 1897. He was the youngest son of Michael Savage who was known locally as a Fenian activist and Bridget Savage; formerly Gildea. After leaving school he worked as an apprentice grocer in Sligo Town before committing himself to the fight for Irish Independence.\n\nSavage moved to Dublin in 1915 and joined the Irish Volunteers. As a 17-year-old he took part in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and fought at the Four Courts. He was captured by the British Army and imprisoned in Richmond Barracks. On 30 April 1916 he was deported to Knutsford Detention Barracks in Cheshire, England along with 200 other captured prisoners. Upon his release Savage returned to Dublin and re-engaged in paramilitary activity and became a Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion of the Dublin Brigade. Within republican circles he was known as a shy, slim built, handsome Sligonian who was a popular and trusted especially amongst the likes of Dan Breen, Seán Treacy and Seán Hogan.\n\nOn 19 December 1919, Savage and 10 fellow Fenian paramilitaries, including Mick McDonnell, Tom Kehoe, Seán Treacy, Séamus Robinson, Seán Hogan, Paddy Daly (Leader), Vincent Byrne, Tom Kilcoyne, Joe Leonard and Dan Breen, met after planning to assassinate the then British Viceroy, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Supreme Commander of the British Army in Ireland, Lord John French, as he returned from a private party which he had hosted the previous evening at his country residence in Frenchpark, County Roscommon.\n\nIt was not originally planned that Savage was to take an active part in the ambush, however, after a chance meeting with Breen and Hogan, Savage insisted that he join the ambushing force. Sean Hogan initially attempted to dissuade him, but relented and gave Savage an automatic pistol. The unit's intelligence operative had informed it that Lord French would be travelling in the second car of the armed convoy that comprised an outrider and three following cars, which would bring Lord French from Ashtown railway station to the Vice-Regal Lodge in Phoenix Park, Dublin.\n\nOn the day of the ambush, Savage attended work as usual and slipped away early in the morning to meet with the other men who were to take part in the attack who were gathered at Fleming's Pub in Drumcondra. They departed Drumcondra in small groups to avoid raising suspicion as they cycled through Phibsboro and up the Cabra Road, and then regrouped at Kelly's Public House (now called the Halfway House) in Ashtown. At approximately 11:40 a.m., as the train carrying Lord French pulled into the station, they left the pub and took up positions along the crossroads at Ashtown.\n\nThe plan was for Martin Savage, Tom Kehoe and Dan Breen to push a hay-cart halfway across the road and then, after the out-rider and the first car had passed, they would push it the rest of the way across the road, thereby completely blocking the path of the remaining vehicles. They had been informed that Lord French was to be in the second car and this car they intended to attack with Mills Bombs and rifle fire.\n\nAs they pushed the hay-cart across the road their plan was almost foiled as a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) disturbed them, telling them to move on. One of them threw a grenade at him, although it didn't explode it struck the police officer on the head, knocking him unconscious. The police officer was then dragged from the road and the attack went ahead as planned.\n\nWhen the convoy appeared minutes later the attack commenced, forcing the target second car in the convoy to swerve off the road. However, unknown to the attackers Lord French was travelling in the first car, which managed to drive through the blockade. The occupants of the second car, part of Lord French's guard, returned fire. As the gun battle developed the third car of the convoy arrived on the other side of the cart, and its occupants began firing with rifles on the now exposed ambushing force. In the exchange of fire Breen was shot in the leg, and seconds later Savage fell mortally wounded after being hit by a bullet in the neck. He died in the arms of Breen and his last words to Breen were \"I'm done, but carry on...\". Tom Kehoe and the wounded Breen succeeded in carrying Savage's body from the road and back to Kelly’s Pub while the gun battle continued. Two Royal Irish Constabulary police officers and a driver were also wounded in the gun battle. At this point the British military, including some wounded, began to withdraw from the scene and continued on towards the Phoenix Park. Knowing British reinforcements would be on their way, the IRA unit itself dispersing to safe houses in the Dublin area. Breen was helped onto his bike by Paddy Daly who helped him to a safehouse in the Phibsboro' area, where he was medically treated to by the captain of the Dublin hurling team, Dr J.M. Ryan.\n\nThe next morning, the \"Irish Independent\" published an article which described the attackers as \"assassins\" and included other such terms as \"criminal folly\", \"outrage\" and \"murder.\" Taking these terms as an insult to their dead comrade, it was decided to attack the newspaper's offices. On Sunday, at 9pm, between twenty and thirty IRA men under the direction of Peadar Clancy entered the offices of the \"Independent\" where they proceeded to wreck its machinery of production. Despite this, with the assistance of the other Dublin newspapers, the \"Independent\" was able to appear the next day, and the owners were awarded £16,000 pounds in compensation. According to Breen in his memoir, neither the \"Independent\", nor any other Dublin newspaper, ever dared refer to the IRA as 'murderers or assassins' again.\n\nSavage's body was taken by British military and an inquest was held into his death. The inquest was attended by his brother and his employer William Kirk, who described the dead soldier as \"a steady, sober and industrious young man, gentlemanly in manner and extremely courteous.\"\n\nAfter the inquest, Savage's body was handed over to his relatives. His remains lay overnight at Broadstone Station before departing for Sligo where it was met at Collooney railway station by a large crowd. His coffin, draped in an Irish Tricolour, was carried over two miles at shoulder height to his family's burial ground. It was buried with military honours in his native Ballisodare, County Sligo.\n\nBreen noted that \"the cortege was several miles long, the Parish Priest attended and recited the last prayer, while the Royal Irish Constabulary, armed with guns, surrounded the graveyard. \"However, I suppose, this was the best tribute they could have paid to a gallant soldier, even though they did not mean it that way\".\n\nIn 1948, the National Graves Association erected a memorial to Savage close to the site of the ambush at Ashtown Cross. There is an annual commemoration of his death at the site of the ambush.\n\nThere have also been a number of streets and public places named after him including Martin Savage Place in County Meath, Martin Savage Road and the home of Kinvara Ards, Martin Savage Park in County Dublin and Martin Savage Terrace near the centre of Sligo Town.\n\nThe Ashtown Fianna Fáil Cumann, named after Savage, hold an annual commemoration on the Sunday after the anniversary of his death at the Ashtown memorial site. Since 2002, the Sinn Féin Joe McDonnell Cumann hold an annual rally on the anniversary of his death also.\n\nThe Coen/Savage (East Sligo) Sinn Féin Cumann also hold a wreath laying ceremony every Easter Sunday morning at Martin Savage's graveside in Ballisodare, Co.

{"id": "343162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343162", "title": "Mole (espionage)", "text": "Mole (espionage)\n\nIn espionage jargon, a mole (also called a \"penetration agent\", \"deep cover agent\", or \"sleeper agent\") is a long-term spy (espionage agent) who is recruited before having access to secret intelligence, subsequently managing to get into the target organization. However, it is popularly used to mean any long-term clandestine spy or informant within an organization, government or private.\n\nThe term was introduced to the public by British spy novelist John Le Carré in his 1974 novel \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" and has since entered general usage, but its origin is unclear, as well as to what extent it was used by intelligence services before it became popularized. Le Carré, a former British intelligence officer, has said that the term mole was actually used by the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, and that a corresponding term used by Western intelligence services was \"sleeper agent\". While the term \"mole\" had been applied to spies in the book \"Historie of the Reign of King Henry VII\" written in 1626 by Sir Francis Bacon, Le Carré has said he did not get the term from that source.\n\nA mole may be recruited early in life, and take decades to get a job in government service and reach a position of access to secret information before becoming active as a spy. Perhaps the most famous examples of moles were the Cambridge Five, five upper-class British men recruited by the KGB as left-wing students at Cambridge University in the 1930s who later rose to high levels in various parts of the British government. By contrast, most espionage agents, such as CIA Director of Counterintelligence Aldrich Ames and FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who spied on the US government for the KGB, were either recruited or offer their services as spies after they were in place as members of the target organization.\n\nBecause their recruitment occurred in the remote past, moles are difficult for a nation's security services to detect. The possibility that a top politician, corporate executive, government minister, or officer in an intelligence service could be a mole working for a foreign government is the worst nightmare of counterintelligence services. For example, James Angleton, director of counterintelligence for the CIA between 1954 and 1975, was reportedly obsessed with suspicions that the top levels of Western governments were riddled with long-term communist agents and accused numerous politicians such as former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Canadian Prime Ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau, former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and many members of Congress before he was removed in 1975. Fears of such moles in prominent positions in American life led to overreactions such as McCarthyism.\n\nMoles have been featured in numerous espionage films, television shows, and novels.\n\nThe most common procedure used by intelligence services to recruit agents is to find the location within the foreign government or organization of the information they want (the \"target\"), find out which people have access to it, and attempt to recruit one of them as a spy (\"agent\") to obtain the information. However, the people with access to top secret government information, government employees with high security clearances, are carefully monitored by the government's security apparatus for just this sort of espionage approach. Thus, it is difficult for a representative of the foreign intelligence service to meet with them clandestinely to recruit them. Private organizations such as large corporations or terrorist groups have similar security monitors. In addition, the security clearance process weeds out employees who are openly disgruntled, ideologically disaffected, or otherwise have motives for betraying their country, so people in such positions are likely to reject recruitment as spies. Therefore, some intelligence services have tried to reverse the above process by first recruiting potential agents and then having them conceal their allegiance and pursue careers in the target government agency in the hope that they can reach positions of access to desired information.\n\nBecause the spy career of a mole is such a long-term one, sometimes occupying most of a lifetime, persons who become moles must be highly motivated. One common motivation is ideology (political convictions). During the Cold War a major source of moles in Western countries was so-called fellow travellers, Westerners who, in their youth in the 1920s to 1940s, became disaffected with their own governments and sympathetic to world communism without actually joining the Communist Party.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for having allegedly cheated William Blake out of the potential profits of his engraving depicting Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims.\n\nIn the early years of the nineteenth century Cromek had supported Blake, and had engraved Blake's design for Benjamin Heath Malkin's \"A Father's Memoirs of his Child\" in 1806. Cromek later commissioned Blake to illustrate Robert Blair's poem \"The Grave\". Blake had produced the designs, but his sample engraving was considered by Cromek to be too crude to attract subscribers. Cromek then gave the lucrative job of engraving Blake's designs to a rival engraver Luigi Schiavonetti.\n\nIn response, Blake proceeded to create a self-engraved illustration to Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\". Cromek, however, had also given the idea to Blake's friend Thomas Stothard. Stothard's print became far more popular than Blake's, at least during their lifetimes. It remains unclear whether Blake or Cromek originated this project, but Blake certainly believed that the idea was stolen from him. The incident destroyed the friendship between Blake and Stothard.\n\nAs a savagely humorous comment on these events Blake wrote epigrams attacking Cromek: \n\nCromek loves artists as he loves his meat:<br>\nHe loves the Art; but 'tis the art to cheat.<br>\n<br>\nA petty sneaking knave I knew--<br>\n\"O! Mr. Cromek, how do ye do?\"\n\nIn 1809 Cromek published \"Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song\", a collection of Scottish ballads. The aspirant poet Allan Cunningham sent in poems of his own authorship, which Cromek included in the collection, even though he may have suspected their real authorship.\n\nAbout that time Cromek also compiled \"RELIQUES OF ROBERT BURNS; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs \". The original edition of 1808 contained a 4-page work by Thomas Stothard, \"The Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury\", which did not appear in some later editions.\n\nHis son was the artist Thomas Hartley Cromek.\n"}

Serving with the UN for 40 years and rising to the rank of Assistant Secretary-General, his ideas about world government, world peace and spirituality led to the increased representation of religions in the UN, especially of New Age Movement. He was known by some as \"the philosopher of the United Nations\".\n\nBorn in Belgium, Robert Muller grew up in the Alsace-Lorraine region in France as a French citizen. Alsace-Lorraine borders Germany. His childhood home was on the border. The border issues he saw as a child had a significant impact on his life, his decision to work at the United Nations. During his youth Robert Muller experienced constant political and cultural turmoil. He knew the horrors of World War II, of being a refugee, of the Nazi occupation in France, imprisonment and escape from prison. During the war he was a member of the French Resistance where towards the end of the war he unsuccessfully tried to prevent the slaughter of a group of captured German soldiers. This was a major life event that led to work for peace. After the war he returned home and earned a Doctorate of Law from the University of Strasbourg. In 1948 he entered and won an essay contest on how to govern the world, the prize of which was an internship at the newly created United Nations.\n\nDr. Muller began working at the United Nations just as it was forming. He devoted the next 40 years of his life behind the scenes at the United Nations, focusing his energies on nurturing a better world, including working for the environment, economics and peace. He was instrumental in the conception of many multilateral bodies, including the UN Development Programme, the World Food Programme, the UN Population Fund, and the World Youth Assembly. He rose through the ranks at the UN to the official position of Assistant Secretary-General and served under three Secretaries-General.\n\nRobert Muller created a \"World Core Curriculum\" that earned him the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education in 1989. The \"World Core Curriculum\" helped inspire the growing Global Education movement. More than 30 Robert Muller schools were founded throughout the world, including LIFE School in Panajachel, Guatemala, from which students have gone on to pursue degrees in International Affairs.\n\nHe was the recipient of multiple awards and honors, including the Albert Schweitzer International Prize for the Humanities and the Eleanor Roosevelt Man of Vision Award.\n\nIn addition to his duties at the University for Peace, he devoted time to his writings and was an internationally acclaimed, multilingual speaker and author of fourteen books published in various languages. One of his major writings came from writing one idea-dream each day for nurturing a better world. His goal was to have written 2000 ideas and dreams by the beginning of the new millennium. He achieved this and went on to write over 7000 ideas and dreams. In his speeches he spoke of these idea-dreams and over the years noted that many of these ideas were being worked on and some had been completed.\n\nAt the prompting of many of his friends, admirers and non-governmental organizations, Robert Muller was a candidate as a global citizen in 1996 for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations.

He was one of the first thinkers to describe the effect of propaganda on the psychology of masses and warned against the techniques used by the Nazi Party. He was friends with Einstein and discussed his fears concerning the rise of Nazism with him.\n\nChakhotin was born in Istanbul, the son of Stepan Ivanovich Chakhotin. His father had previously been a private secretary to Ivan Turgenev, before pursuing a diplomatic career which led to him becoming a consular interpreter in Istanbul. His mother, Alexandra Motzo, was Greek and in 1893 he moved with her to Odessa.\n\nChakhotin enrolled at the Moscow State University and participated in the occupation staged there in 1902. This led to his arrest, imprisonment and a period of exile in Germany. He studied medicine at the University of Heidelberg, going on to getting a doctorate in zoology. He developed the micropuncture microscope which enabled the ultraviolet examination of cells. This helped enable him to return to Russia in 1912. Here he worked at the Institute of Experimental Medicine under Ivan Pavlov in St Petersburg. In 1915 Chakhotin was involved with the Committee for Military-Technical Assistance (Komitet Voenno-Technicheskoi Pomoschi), which liaised with technical, industrial and scientific experts in order to mobilise them for the war effort.

She made several other faceless appearances throughout the volume's first story arc, before making her full debut in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #4 (July 2014), as part of a tie-in to the \"Original Sin\" storyline. An ongoing title featuring Silk started publishing in February 2015, with scripts by \"Supernatural\" writer Robbie Thompson and art by Stacey Lee. \"Silk\" volume 1 came to an end during the \"Secret Wars\" event. After the event, a second volume began which concluded on issue #19.\n\nThirteen years ago during a demonstration on the use of radioactive rays at a science exhibit, a spider is accidentally exposed to large amounts of radiation. In its dying moments, the arachnid bites Peter Parker. As a result, the young teenager gains amazing powers and becomes Spider-Man. However, this is not the end. Mere moments after biting Parker, the spider bites another young student named Cindy Moon. Soon after, Cindy's abilities, including organic webbing (unlike Peter), manifest but she is unable to control them. Some time later, Ezekiel approaches the Moon family to offer his help and guide Cindy in controlling her newfound abilities. After six years training to use her powers, Cindy is locked up inside a facility by Ezekiel to protect her and the other \"spiders\" from Morlun and his family called the Inheritors.\n\nSeven years later during the \"Original Sin\" storyline, Spider-Man is exposed to the energies of the Watcher's eye. He receives a vision of the radioactive spider that bit him also biting Cindy Moon, and learns what happened to her afterwards. Spider-Man immediately goes on to search for Cindy to break her out of the facility Ezekiel had kept her. After freeing Cindy, she attacks Spider-Man in a fit of rage saying that he has doomed them all. Spider-Man calms Cindy down by telling her that Morlun is dead. Cindy makes her way out of the facility to finally see the city of New York, stopping only to make a costume out of her webbing. She tells Spider-Man to refer to her as Silk. Silk is heartbroken to find that her family has moved. Silk and Peter also find that they are powerfully attracted to each other due to their shared spider-sense. Silk finds out that Morlun might be still alive, which causes her to attack Peter. However, their attraction makes them kiss. Peter stops as soon as Cindy begins to remove his mask, after which they move back to Peter and Anna Maria's apartment. Afterwards, Peter and Cindy go to the Fact Channel's news station where they are attacked by Black Cat and Electro. While Silk is easily able to dodge Electro's lightning bolts thanks to her \"hyper-spider-speed and senses,\" Spider-Man isn't as lucky. Black Cat then goes after the paralyzed superhero and begins to unmask him in front of live TV. Thankfully, J. Jonah Jameson hogged up too much space in front of the camera, preventing the camera (and anyone else) from seeing Peter's face. Silk quickly spins a temporary mask for Peter and escapes with him back into Peter and Anna Maria's apartment. At the waterfront where Parker Industries will be holding the demonstration for their new device meant to cure Electro, Cindy spins Peter some Electro-insulated webbing to prevent what happened during their last fight with Electro from happening again. When the fight begins, Black Cat sabotages the machine which causes Electro to go out of control and hit a helicopter. Silk hurries and begins spinning porous webs to catch the crashing helicopter. She then creates an insulated web-pod to contain the inevitable explosion of energy coming from Electro. The entire incident ends with a depowered Electro and a missing Black Cat. Afterwards, Cindy gets accepted for a job at the Fact Channel where she intends to use the information center in order to find her family.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, Spider-Man and Silk discuss their problem in which whenever they get close, they feel the need to have intimate interactions as well as possible solutions to this. They end up fighting Looter and his henchmen where they are stealing equipment and Spiderling costumes from Spider-Island II. Spider-Man and Silk managed to defeat them with the help of Spider-Woman, Spider-Anya, and Spider-Man 2099 as the final henchman is defeated by Spider-Girl of Earth-982, Spider-UK, and Spider-Ham. Silk accompanies the other spider-themed heroes through the portal to Earth-13. When Spider-Man wants Silk to be among those to accompany him to gather the other spider-themed heroes, Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4 advises that Silk should stay behind. Silk ends up following anyway which later angers Old Man Spider-Man when they arrive on Earth-928. He mentioned that Silk shouldn't have left her bunker. After Daemos was slain, Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body) blames Silk for Daemos' attack and suggests that they kill her. When Brix, Bora, and a Daemos clone arrive and kill Old Man Spider-Man Silk steals Spider-Man's portal device, intending to set right the deaths she caused and opens a portal while attracting the Inheritors' attention. Spider-Woman volunteers to follow Silk while Superior Spider-Man sends Spider-Man Noir to accompany them. After Spider-Man of Earth-90214 was badly injured, Silk and Spider-Woman take him back to Earth-90214 so that he can die recuperate. Superior Spider-Man expresses concern since the Inheritors have already been there, but Spider-Man says Silk should be safe as long as she keeps moving and takes one of Superior Spider-Man's cloaking devices. Spider-Gwen and Spider-Girl (Anya Corozon) were to supervise Silk, but runs off on her own with Brix and Bora hot on her trail. Her teleporter is broken and she's surrounded by the Inheritor twins, so she dives into Earth 001 to escape. She then finds Jessica Drew 616 impostering that dimensions Jessica Drew. She uses her teleporter to escape, but ends up in Earth 3145-the only world the Inheritors cannot attack due to a post-thermo nuclear war. Silk is able to survive when she creates a web-suit. She finds her way to this dimensions SIMS building and finds that dimensions spider totem in a nuclear bunker—Ben Parker. She then sends clues to the other Spiders of the safe zone and goes back to Earth 001 to save Jessica Drew, but gets captured by the Inheritors. She is one of the three key totems, The Bride. During the final sacrifice of her, Benjy Parker of MC2, and Kaine, the Spider Army are able to stop the Inheritors and save her and Benjy. After Superior Spider-Man kills the Grand Weaver, she volunteers to take his place, but Karn decides to be the new Weaver, since through a time paradox he was the weaver all along. Silk, Jessica Drew, and Spider-Man return to Earth 616.\n\nAfter arriving back in New York, Silk begins a career of crime-fighting while searching for her family after ten years, as well as continuing her job as a Fact Channel intern. Wanting to move focus on the search for them, Cindy moves out of her friend's apartment and moves back into her old bunker, which she uses as a base of operations. Discovering that her family has no official records of being around, save for some old files, she goes to her old neighborhood. Here she runs into her high school boyfriend, who is now engaged. Unbeknownst to Silk during all this, two mysterious figures are watching her whenever she is in the bunker.\n\nAs seen in the first issue of the \"Silk\" comic book title, she engages in battle against a costumed villain called Dragonclaw (whose name she says sounds like a Pokémon), and also engages in antagonism with Black Cat.\n\nSpider-Man thinks she is not well and asks the Fantastic Four to check her. Silk consents to the check up but becomes annoyed when she finds out Peter revealed the history about her bunker and Ezekiel to them. It is revealed that Silk is physically fine, but is dealing with anxiety issues, and is referred to a therapist (who she eventually visits in the seventh issue). She and Human Torch also go on a date of crime fighting despite Peter's protests.\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, Cindy Moon begins her run as Silk and comes across Dragonclaw and defeats him. Later, she finds out Dragonclaw did this because he was in the debt of Black Cat. This was the reason for his misdeeds and the tries to help him out by enlisting the help of Spider-Man to find Black Cat's gang causing a show down between Silk and Black Cat which leads to Silk cutting her hair to escape. While this was going on, it is show that Silk is still very confused as to what has happened to her family and ex-boyfriend which leads her to take a job under J. Jonah Jameson at the Fact Channel who takes an immediate liking to her as she suggests that they start taking photos of silk. One day, J. Jonah Jameson looks at Cindy Moon's screen to find out that she was trying to find where her family is which also leads her to tell him everything about her. A couple of days pass and it is shown to be the final incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610 as time is running out. J. Jonah Jameson gives Silk a case file of a young boy who seems to be Silk's brother as he tells her this. She runs straight out going to that location where she meets her brother now with a 'X' shape scar on the left side of his forehead embraces him. As the world is ending, Silk tells her brother \"I'm sorry. For everything. And I love you, Albert. I love you.\"\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" branding, Silk is on a stakeout at a skating rink. Silk's spider-sense goes off as a group of Goblin Nation grunts rob a bank. Monologuing to herself, Silk reveals she'd been tailing the Goblin Nation for two weeks in order to avenge her brother who was infused with Goblin Formula and now has no memory of what happened to their parents. Extending claws, Silk slashes the Goblin Nation grunts' getaway car and webs them up, taking their loot, a safety deposit box containing Parker Industries tech. Thinking to herself that she has no idea what's in the safety deposit box just that her boss wants it, Silk returns to her now-employer Black Cat, who she is working with despite their earlier antagonism, who scolds her for showing mercy and tells her that being good is bad for business.\n\nDuring the events in the \"Spider-Women\" event, Cindy learns her counterpart from Earth-65 (home of Spider-Gwen) is the cause of Gwen's powers, and has traveled to Prime Earth to steal and reverse engineer the technology of the greatest minds of the universe for war mongering. Upon confronting Cindy-65 with Spider-Gwen, Gwen loses her powers from Cindy-65's nanobots and Cindy-Prime's name as SILK is tarnished as a villain, so much so that her S.H.I.E.L.D. handler Mockingbird thinks she actually did the crimes she's accused of. After Black Cat's freeing of Silk from a S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoner convoy, Cindy chooses to stay with Black Cat (cont. undercover), and later went back to help Gwen and Jessica win the boss fight with Cindy-65, who utilized a gauntlet which replicates the abilities of the universes most formidable superhumans. Cindy, as a result of her Earth-65 counterpart's defamation, earns more of Black Cat's trust to gain deeper intelligence of her criminal operation, still intending to complete her mission and get whatever S.H.I.E.L.D. has on her family's whereabouts. Eventually, Black Cat discover her alliance with Mockingbird, prompting Silk to fight her. During the ensuing fight, Cindy falls into one of the dumpster, and was saved by a mysterious figure called Spectro, who was revealed to be Cindy's ex-boyfriend Hector.\n\nIt is revealed that Hector actually died (while Cindy was being held in the bunker) when a neighbor attempted to summon a demon in his apartment block, resulting in him wandering the Material World and only able to manage tangibility when in combat. Cindy's colleagues Rafferty and Lola at Fact Channel News discover her secret identity and Cindy embraces this opportunity to open up to them, which helps relief some of her feelings of loneliness in the world. Rafferty reveals that they have discovered Dr. Kapoor's lab, which has been abandoned for months but has a secret benefactor continually paying the rent. The three of them travel to the labs location, which unbeknownst to them is part of a trap for Silk by a villain called Fang. Shortly after they arrive at the lab, they discover a dimensional doorway which leads they to the Negative Zone. Upon journeying to the Negative Zone, Silk, Rafferty, and Lola relish the adventurous experience and befriend a medieval dragon called David. David explains the continuing war of the Red Knight against the evil forces of the Ash King and his army. He caught the scent of their arrival, which mimicked the arrival of a previously three (from the outer world) years ago. The three aid the Red Knight. After the battle is won, with the defeat of the Ash King, the Red King is revealed to be Cindy's mother Nari Moon. Nari explains to Cindy that she and her father, who has become a prisoner of the Ash King some time previously, had originally traveled to the Negative Zone in search of a blue substance they believed could be synthesized into an antidote for the spider bite that Cindy received and which would have nullified her powers, thus removing the threat of the Inheritors. Cindy's father Albert Moon Sr. is soon liberated from his prison and soon after the five say there goodbyes to their friends in the Negative Zone and re-enter the dimensional doorway. Mockingbird gives financial help to the family in the form of an abode in which to live, and the family begin building bridges with each other which places Cindy at a crossroads on what to do with her life next. What Cindy doesn't know is that Albert Moon Sr. is in possession of the mysterious blue substance and delivers it to Fang who claims it is time to \"put an end to Silk once and for all...\"\n\nDuring the \"\" event, Cindy is glad to have her family back, but still feels distant from them and doesn't make as much of an effort to spend as much time with them. When J. Jonah Jameson wants one of his workers to investigate the New U Technologies scenario in San Francisco, Cindy volunteers to go to get away from the city as Hector (now calling himself Spectro) accompanies her. Jameson is enthusiastic for her that her family is back together and leaves for dinner, but Cindy found something off about his behavior. She and Hector decide to investigate Jameson's room in New U Technologies and she uses her powers to create a different costume from her Silk outfit to avoid suspicion. Hector calls her new identity \"Silkworm\" much to her annoyance. Cindy's suspicions are confirmed when she finds Jameson talking with his formerly deceased wife Marla while Spectro finds a room with a number of test subjects in capsules. Spectro triggers the intruder alert, prompting Cindy to escape. Before Cindy can leave, she's attacked by the resurrected Spider-Woman Mattie Franklin. Silk fights Mattie Franklin on the top of the roof of New U Technologies. When Mattie Franklin claims to Silk that New U Technologies is doing things for good purposes and offers her a tour in exchange for removing her mask, Silk gets away. At Fact Channel, Rafferty and Lola look more into New U Technologies and tell Cindy they'll update her with more information. Cindy is then approached in her apartment by J. Jonah Jameson. Cindy gives her Rafferty and Lola's research to voice skepticism on the New U Technologies and Jameson invites her to join him on a quick trip to the facility. He tells Cindy that he believes they're doing good work and introduces her to Mattie and Marla. After J. Jonah Jameson and Marla leave for Marla's treatment, Mattie tells Cindy that she knows she's Silk and takes her to investigate the facility. Mattie tells her that she's suspicious of the whole experiment as some of the other resurrected characters have been showing slight behavioral glitches and takes her to a place called \"Haven\" where they find Hector back in his own body. Back at Cindy's home, Mr. Moon has hidden a package that Cindy wanted Albert to open and tells Rafferty and Lola to stay out of their business while receiving instructions from a mysterious woman. At \"Haven,\" an alarm goes off and starts affecting all the resurrected clones. Hector starts becoming Spectro again and prepares to attack Cindy. J. Jonah Jameson's broadcast causes the Carrion virus to start spreading worldwide. Mattie helps Cindy deal with Hector who reverts to his ghostly form after his cloned body disintegrates. The three of them head up to the broadcast center, where the Carrion Virus quickly spreads due to Marla Jameson opening the doors. Spider-Man and Anna Maria Marconi arrive to stop the broadcast as Mattie reveals to J. Jonah Jameson her superpowers. Silk holds the door back to prevent more infected hosts coming in and Mattie saves her from one of the carriers infecting her and passes out in the process. After Spider-Man sends out the Webware Emergency Signal, J. Jonah Jameson and Silk find Marla and Mattie reduced to dust.\n\nFollowing the incident, Cindy quits her job at the Fact Channel and contemplates what she wants to do with her life. After a discussion with her brother, therapist, and helping a child free his kite in the graveyard (which she was visiting to see Mattie's grave), she decides to enlist in S.H.I.E.L.D. academy. With S.H.I.E.L.D.'s technology, she researches her father's meetings and eventually confronts him about his secret meetings with a mysterious doctor, who turns about to be a Tamara Pearson aka Fang. Fang worked for Ezekiel and was the leader of a splinter group of the spider society, and while she claims to Cindy's father that she will be \"curing\" Cindy of her powers, her actual plan is to transfer Cindy's powers to herself and use her abilities to take over the Spider Society. After inheriting Ezekiel's fortune and drugging Cindy's father, she's kept her eyes on Cindy during her time during and after the bunker. Silk defeats Fang with the help of Hector and her father accepts her for who she is. With her family closer, her job at S.H.I.E.L.D., and with Rafferty and Lola married, Cindy finally feels happiness after a long time.\n\nDuring the \"Go Down Swinging\" storyline, Silk along with Miles Morales helps Spider-Man in his fight with the Red Goblin (Green Goblin possessed by the Carnage symbiote). They are injured by the Red Goblin during the fight and later saved by Flash Thompson.\n\nCindy gained similar abilities to Peter Parker when she was bitten by the same radioactive spider that gave him his abilities, though her spider-sense (dubbed by her as \"Silk Sense\") is far stronger than Peter's. On their first meeting, Peter observed that she was even faster than him, though not quite as strong. She also has the ability to shoot webs out of her fingertips, and she has an eidetic memory.\n\n\"Cosmopolitan\" referred to Silk as \"Marvel's badass Asian-American superheroine with Spidey-Sense\".\n\nIn the crossover event \"Spider-Women\", it is revealed that the Cindy Moon of the \"Spider-Gwen\" universe is the head of a nefarious spy organization called S.I.L.K., and serves as the main antagonist of the event. Cindy of Earth-65 almost had a similar spider bite accident to the main one, but a teacher swatted it with a newspaper. Dissatisfied with her life, she joins S.H.I.E.L.D. as a researcher in spiders. There was a spider-related incident in which Jesse Drew was nearly killed, but Cindy's research saves his life and gives him spider powers, with Agent Drew making it up to Cindy by becoming one of her top agents. She eventually recovers the altered spider back from S.H.I.E.L.D. with Jesse's help and releases it into the open, where it bit Gwen Stacy and led to her becoming Earth-65's Spider-Woman. During the Spider-Women event, Jesse steals Gwen's interdimensional teleporter and travels to Earth-616, where she steals a large amount of technology while framing her 616 counterpart. When she encounters Gwen and her counterpart, she uses her technology to take away Gwen's powers. When she returns to her hideout after Jesse's betrayal, she is ambushed by Jessica Drew, Gwen, and her counterpart and is defeated. S.H.I.E.L.D. locks her up for her crimes and her counterpart teases her by sending her a care package with all the things she had in her bunker.\n\nThe Earth-616 Silk had managed to meet the parents of her Earth-65 counterpart.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A former American politician, he was a member of the Republican Party who was the U.S. Representative for from 2011 to 2017. Huelskamp was rated the least bipartisan member of the House during the 114th Congress by The Lugar Center - McCourt school Bipartisan Index. Prior to entering Congress, he represented the 38th District of the Kansas Senate from 1997 until 2011. Huelskamp, who was known for his strong social conservatism, was the chairman of the House Tea Party Caucus from February 2015. He ran for re-election in 2016 but was defeated in the Republican primary on August 2, 2016, by Roger Marshall. His term in the House continued until January 3, 2017.\n\nHuelskamp was born on November 11, 1968 and raised on the Huelskamp family farm in Fowler, Kansas. Pioneered by his grandparents Martin and Clara in 1926, the farm operation includes raising corn, cattle, wheat, milo, and soybeans. He attended elementary and high school in Fowler, where he was a Farm Bureau Youth Leader, a member of St. Anthony's Parish, and active in both 4-H and Future Farmers of America.\n\nAfter attending seminary for two years in Santa Fe, Huelskamp continued his education at the College of Santa Fe (now Santa Fe University of Art and Design) and received his B.A. in social science education in 1991. He received his Ph.D. in political science, concentrating in agricultural policy from the American University in 1995.\n\nHis term in the House continued until January 3, 2017. In June 2017, Huelskamp was named President of the Illinois-based think tank The Heartland Institute.\n\nIn 1996, Huelskamp challenged Republican incumbent state senator Marian Reynolds in the primary and won by a landslide margin, taking 62 percent of the vote to Reynolds's 38 percent. The youngest state senator in 20 years, he then won re-election by wide margins in 2000, 2004 and 2008.\n\nHuelskamp served on the following legislative committees:\nHuelskamp previously served on the state's Ways and Means Committee but was removed due to clashes with colleagues and with the Committee's leadership.\n\n\nSeven-term Congressman Jerry Moran gave up the Big First seat to make a successful run for the United States Senate seat being vacated by the popular fourteen-year incumbent Republican Sam Brownback, who was running for governor that year. This touched off a free-for-all in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Huelskamp finished first in the six-candidate primary field with 34.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring that he would be the district's next representative.\n\nHuelskamp ran against Democratic nominee Alan Jilka and Libertarian nominee Jack W. Warner. Huelskamp was endorsed by the Club for Growth, Mike Huckabee, Conservative Leadership PAC, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, Ron Paul and Ken Blackwell.\n\nAs expected, Huelskamp won the seat in a rout, taking 73 percent of the vote.\n\n\nHuelskamp ran unopposed in the general election.\n\n\nUnlike the previous election, Huelskamp was challenged by a Republican, Alan LaPolice, in the primary. Moreover, two Democrats ran for the primary Jim Sherow, a Kansas State University professor, and Bryan Whitney, a 2013 Wichita State University grad. Both LaPolice and Sherow critiqued Huelskamp for his failure to work with other Members of Congress and voting against Farm Bill. Huelskamp narrowly defeated LaPolice in the Republican Primary with only 55% of the vote. Huelskamp failed to receive the endorsement of the Farm Bureau and the Kansas Livestock Association. Huelskamp went on to win the general election with 68% of the vote.\n\n\nHuelskamp was defeated in the Republican primary by Roger Marshall, an obstetrician from Great Bend, by 58% to 42%. Marshall's supporters argued Huelskamp's combativeness hurt the district. House leadership had removed Huelskamp from the House Agriculture Committee in 2012; farm groups such as Kansas Farm Bureau, an affiliate of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Kansas Livestock Association, an affiliate of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Association of Wheat Growers and the US Chamber of Commerce endorsed Marshall, as many Republican voters saw it as a crucial issue in a farm state.\n\nIn early 2012, Huelskamp introduced legislation that would ensure military chaplains could not be \"directed, ordered or required to perform any duty, rite, ritual, ceremony, service or function that is contrary to the conscience, moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain, or contrary to the moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain's faith group.\" The language appeared to be related to permitting same-sex marriages on military bases in states where such unions are permitted.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, during a contentious three-hour House Budget Committee hearing with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Huelskamp warned of the looming threat of an economic crisis similar to the one then taking place in Europe. Huelskamp accused Geithner and the entire Obama administration of failing to correct the U.S.'s debt crisis, which he believed would lead the country down the same path. Geithner replied that Huelskamp had an \"adolescent perspective on how to think about economic policy.\"\n\nAfter the United States Supreme Court declared the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional on June 26, 2013, Huelskamp immediately announced that he would introduce a constitutional amendment to restore the Defense of Marriage Act. He then went on \"The Steve Deace Show\", a conservative radio program, to denounce the Supreme Court Justices. \"The idea that Jesus Christ himself was degrading and demeaning is what they've come down to,\" he said. \"I can't even stand to read the decisions because I don't even think they'd pass law school with decisions like that.\"\n\n\nThe House Republican Steering Committee removed Huelskamp from both the Budget Committee and the Agriculture Committee in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift. At a Heritage Foundation lunch in the immediate wake of the removal, Huelskamp said: \"It's petty, it's vindictive, and if you have any conservative principles you will be punished for articulating those.\" He joined Justin Amash of Michigan and David Schweikert of Arizona in a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner, demanding to know why they had lost their \"plum\" committee posts.\n\n\"Politico\" quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia as explaining that Huelskamp, Amash and Schweikert were removed for \"their inability to work with other members.\" The spokesperson clarified that Westmoreland \"said that it had nothing to do with their voting record, a scorecard, or their actions across the street [meaning fundraising].\" The three were described by \"Politico\" and its sourcing of Huelskamp's other colleagues as \"jerks\" who \"made life harder for other Republicans by taking whacks at them in public for supporting the team\".\n\nOn January 3, 2013, Huelskamp appeared to be counting votes as part of an effort to unseat House Speaker John Boehner when the 113th Congress convened. Huelskamp nominated conservative Jim Jordan to replace Boehner. When asked about the anti-Boehner effort, a spokesman for Huelskamp declined to comment.\n\n\nHuelskamp and his wife Angela live in Fowler, Kansas. They have four adopted children.\n\n\n"}

Graves lives in Ranger, Georgia, southeast of Dalton.\n\nIn 2007, Graves and former Georgia Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers took out a loan from Bartow County Bank to purchase and renovate a motel in Calhoun. In 2011, it was reported that Bartow County Bank had sued Rogers and Graves for defaulting on their $2.2 million bank loan. They countersued the bank in response. In August 2011, both parties dismissed their claims before going to hearing, settling the dispute out of court, and no details of the settlement were disclosed. Graves received criticism in \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" on the grounds that the outcome of this business venture appeared to some individuals to undermine his stated commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n\nTom E. Shanahan retired as Representative to Georgia's 10th District in 2002, and Graves won as his successor with 60 percent of the vote. Graves later ran, unopposed, to serve as House Representative to Georgia's 12th district in 2004.

He authored the Defund Obamacare Act in 2010 and reintroduced the bill in the 112th and 113th Congress.\n\nConservative Blogger Erick Erickson stated in 2014 that Graves has now become a \"judas goat\" leading conservatives to the political slaughterhouse: \"Graves's rapid support for McCarthy can only be seen as opportunistic,\" Erickson wrote, adding: \"The conservative love affair with Graves was already waning. It is time to just end it. Let's see what he gets for himself by trading the veneer of conservatism.\"\n\nGraves co-sponsored a balanced-budget amendment in both the 112th and 113th Congresses and supported the Cut, Cap and Balance Act of 2011, which aimed to reduce federal spending and establish caps in future spending.

He wrote two books, called \"Notes From The Other China\" and \"Why China Will Never Rule the World\". As well as this he also taught History for a year in Scotland.\n\nReviewer Bradley Winterton in the \"Taipei Times\", reviewing his first book, described Parfitt as a \"bad traveler, an insensitive loud-mouth ranting on about the absurdities of life \"abroad\"\".

There is a video which shows that Bolotov participated in voting at a local referendum and showed a Ukrainian passport which indicated that he was born in Taganrog, Rostov Oblast on 13 February 1970. According to other sources, Bolotov was born in Stakhanov. Bolotov moved to Stakhanov in the Luhansk Oblast (province) of eastern Ukraine in 1974. According to the Russia Today, he held two university degrees.\n\nBolotov claimed to be a senior sergeant of the Soviet Airborne Troops in Vitebsk (presumably the 103rd Guards Airborne Division) and between 1989 and 1990 participated in a number of conflicts including Tbilisi, Yerevan and Karabakh. He later became the head of the airborne veterans group, while no one of the Luhansk Oblast group cell can confirm it. Bolotov had a wife and two children.\n\nBolotov worked as a manager and director at a meat factory and used to run a small business.\n\nBefore the pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, Bolotov was a representative of Oleksandr Yefremov who supervised illegal mining in the region.\n\nIn 2014, Bolotov became a leader of an armed group during the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine.

The causes of his death are currently being investigated. The preliminary results of clinical tests showed an acute heart failure as reason of death. The poisoning later was suspected.. Though more detailed report of the local police office claimed that there was no obvious signs of the acute heart failure and only a small atherosclerotic plaques was identified instead. It is known that before death he was complaining to his wife about his health deterioration which happened right after drinking a cup of coffee on the business meeting in company with two men he allegedly knew.. It became later known that Bolotov met with ex-speaker of the People's council of the LNR Alexey Karyakin and Valery Alexadnrovich as Valery had said and added also that the meeting was appointed by request of Bolotov himself. Bolotov's corpse was later tested for the presence of the poisoning drugs in his body at the request of his wife, but as of 2018 the results are unknown.\n\n"}

His term of office as Director General of the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office ended on 30 April 2012.\n\nTopić's appointment as EPO Vice-President has been controversial. Following the announcement of his appointment in March 2012, a number of critical news reports appeared in the Croatian media. These reports referred to a series of alleged irregularities which were said to have occurred during his period of office as Director-General of the State Intellectual Property Office and which it was claimed had not been properly investigated by the competent state authorities. In response, the State Intellectual Property Office issued a press release on 30 April 2012 attributing the media reports to what it called \"unprofessional journalism\" and dismissing the allegations raised against Topić as \"arbitrary\", \"unfounded\" and based on \"malicious accusations\".\n\nA complaint which Topić filed in reaction to an article written by the journalist Slavica Lukić for \"Jutarnji list\" was, however, rejected by the Ethics Council of the Croatian Journalist's Association (Croatian: \"Hrvatsko Novinarsko Društvo\" or HND) in September 2012. The Ethics Council found that Lukić had verified the relevant information with the appropriate official institutions and that the disputed article was not written with the intention of defaming anyone but rather in defence of the public interest.\n\nIn December 2013, a Croatian NGO Juris Protecta raised questions about Topić's EPO appointment and submitted a petition to the European Parliament calling for an independent investigation into the matter. According to Intellectual Property Watch, Topić and EPO President Benoît Battistelli claim that the allegations amount to a “smear campaign.” However, a former Assistant Director at the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office, Vesna Stilin, has disputed the claims made by Topić and Battistelli in this regard.\n\nIt has been reported in the Croatian media that a criminal complaint against Topic was dismissed as inadmissible by the Zagreb County Court on 19 February 2016. Details of the case were not published but it was subsequently reported that it is currently pending before a three-judge appeal panel of the Zagreb County Court.\n\n"}
