A tradition, probably fabricated by 14th century Milanese chroniclers, attributes Alberto the deed of forming the \"Company of Death\" that defended the \"Carroccio\" of the League at the Battle of Legnano. The first historical citation of his name is in 1196. He is thought to have been a \"notaro\" and a \"podestà\".\n\nItalian political party Lega Nord makes use of his myth. The electoral emblem of the party features Alberto with an image inspired by the statue of him erected at Legnano in 1900. Also the infantry brigade \"Legnano \" of the Italian Army used the image of this statue as symbol.\n\nIn the 2009 film \"Barbarossa\", Alberto played by Raz Degan is featured as the protagonist.\n\n"}

{"id": "842605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842605", "title": "Antipope Benedict XIV", "text": "Antipope Benedict XIV\n\nBenedict XIV was the name used by two closely related minor antipopes of the 15th century. The first, Bernard Garnier became antipope in 1424 and died c. 1429. The second, Jean Carrier, became antipope c. 1430 and apparently left office, whether by death or resignation, by 1437.\n\nNeither of these claimants was supported by more than a very small faction within the Church. They claimed to be the successors to Benedict XIII, one of the parties to the great Papal Schism. In 1417, the Council of Constance resolved the Schism, proclaiming Martin V the new Pope and demanding that Benedict XIII renounce his claim. Benedict XIII, however, remained at a castle in Peñíscola (kingdom of Valencia) and continued to maintain supporters. He died in 1423, but, the day before his death, he created four cardinals loyal to him, in order to ensure the Avignon line. Three of these cardinals met and elected Antipope Clement VIII. However, one of Benedict XIII's cardinals, Jean Carrier, disputed the validity of this election. Carrier, acting as the College of Cardinals by himself, elected Bernard Garnier, who took the name Pope Benedict XIV, instead. Carrier was the archdeacon of Rodez, near Toulouse, and Garnier had been the sacristan of Rodez.\n\nGarnier conducted his office secretly and was known as the \"hidden pope\": a letter from the Count of Armagnac to Joan of Arc indicates that only Carrier knew Benedict XIV's location. Garnier's reign as Benedict XIV ended at his death in 1429 or 1430, although he named four of his own cardinals, one of whom was named Jean Farald.\n\nFollowing Garnier's death, Jean Carrier elected himself as the new pope, and also styled himself Pope Benedict XIV. Carrier, however, had been captured and imprisoned by Antipope Clement VIII. Carrier finished his days in captivity in the castle of Foix.\n\nSome imagine that cardinals loyal to him elected a series of increasingly marginal antipopes in 1437 and 1470. For instance, this is the scenario in the 1995 novel \"l'Anneau du pêcheur\" by the French writer Jean Raspail.\n\n"}
{"id": "221377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221377", "title": "Augusta, Lady Gregory", "text": "Augusta, Lady Gregory\n\nIsabella Augusta, Lady Gregory (\"née\" Persse; 15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932) was an Irish dramatist, folklorist and theatre manager. With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, she turned against it. Her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.\n\nLady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the Irish Literary Revival. Her home at Coole Park in County Galway served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important as her creative writings for that theatre's development. Lady Gregory's motto was taken from Aristotle: \"To think like a wise man, but to express oneself like the common people.\".\n\nGregory was born at Roxborough, County Galway, the youngest daughter of the Anglo-Irish gentry family Persse. Her mother, Frances Barry, was related to Viscount Guillamore, and her family home, Roxborough, was a 6,000-acre (24 km²) estate located between Gort and Loughrea, the main house of which was later burnt down during the Irish Civil War. She was educated at home, and her future career was strongly influenced by the family nurse (i.e. nanny), Mary Sheridan, a Catholic and a native Irish speaker, who introduced the young Augusta to the history and legends of the local area.\n\nShe married Sir William Henry Gregory, a widower with an estate at Coole Park, near Gort, on 4 March 1880 in St Matthias' Church, Dublin. Sir William, who was 35 years her elder, had just retired from his position as Governor of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), having previously served several terms as Member of Parliament for County Galway. He was a well-educated man with many literary and artistic interests, and the house at Coole Park housed a large library and extensive art collection, both of which Lady Gregory was eager to explore. He also had a house in London, where the couple spent a considerable amount of time, holding weekly salons frequented by many leading literary and artistic figures of the day, including Robert Browning, Lord Tennyson, John Everett Millais and Henry James. Their only child, Robert Gregory, was born in 1881. He was killed during the First World War while serving as a pilot, an event which inspired W. B. Yeats's poems \"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death\", \"In Memory of Major Robert Gregory\" and \"Shepherd and Goatherd\".\n\nThe Gregorys travelled in Ceylon, India, Spain, Italy and Egypt. While in Egypt, Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, during which she wrote a series of love poems, \"A Woman's Sonnets\".\n\nHer earliest work to appear under her own name was \"Arabi and His Household\" (1882), a pamphlet—originally a letter to \"The Times\"—in support of Ahmed Orabi Pasha, leader of what has come to be known as the Urabi Revolt, an 1879 Egyptian nationalist revolt against the oppressive regime of the Khedive and the European domination of Egypt. She later said of this booklet, \"whatever political indignation or energy was born with me may have run its course in that Egyptian year and worn itself out\". Despite this, in 1893 she published \"A Phantom's Pilgrimage, or Home Ruin\", an anti-Nationalist pamphlet against William Ewart Gladstone's proposed second Home Rule Act.\n\nShe continued to write prose during the period of her marriage. During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title \"An Emigrant's Notebook\", but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called \"Over the River\", in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, \"If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says.\".\n\nA trip to Inisheer in the Aran Islands in 1893 re-awoke for Lady Gregory an interest in the Irish language and in the folklore of the area in which she lived. She organised Irish lessons at the school at Coole, and began collecting tales from the area around her home, especially from the residents of Gort workhouse. One of the tutors she employed was Norma Borthwick, who would visit Coole numerous times. This activity led to the publication of a number of volumes of folk material, including \"A Book of Saints and Wonders\" (1906), \"The Kiltartan History Book\" (1909) and \"The Kiltartan Wonder Book\" (1910). She also produced a number of collections of \"Kiltartanese\" versions of Irish myths, including \"Cuchulain of Muirthemne\" (1902) and \"Gods and Fighting Men\" (1904). (\"Kiltartanese\" is Lady Gregory's term for English with Gaelic syntax, based on the dialect spoken in Kiltartan.) In his introduction to the former, Yeats wrote \"I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time.\". James Joyce was to parody this claim in the Scylla and Charybdis chapter of his novel \"Ulysses\".\n\nTowards the end of 1894, encouraged by the positive reception of the editing of her husband's autobiography, Lady Gregory turned her attention to another editorial project. She decided to prepare selections from Sir William Gregory's grandfather's correspondence for publication as \"Mr Gregory's Letter-Box 1813–30\" (1898). This entailed her researching Irish history of the period; one outcome of this work was a shift in her political position, from the \"soft\" Unionism of her earlier writing on Home Rule to a definite support of Irish nationalism and Republicanism, and to what she was later to describe as \"a dislike and distrust of England\".\n\nEdward Martyn was a neighbour of Lady Gregory, and it was during a visit to his home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats. Discussions between the three of them, over the following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's \"The Heather Field\" and Yeats's \"The Countess Cathleen\".\n\nThe Irish Literary Theatre project lasted until 1901, when it collapsed owing to lack of funding. In 1904, Lady Gregory, Martyn, Yeats, John Millington Synge, Æ, Annie Horniman and William and Frank Fay came together to form the Irish National Theatre Society. The first performances staged by the society took place in a building called the Molesworth Hall. When the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting to meet the needs of the society.\n\nOn 11 May 1904, the society formally accepted Horniman's offer of the use of the building. As Horniman was not normally resident in Ireland, the Royal Letters Patent required were paid for by her but granted in the name of Lady Gregory. One of her own plays, \"Spreading the News\", was performed on the opening night, 27 December 1904. At the opening of Synge's \"The Playboy of the Western World\" in January 1907, a significant portion of the crowd rioted, causing the remainder of the performances to be acted out in dumbshow. Lady Gregory did not think as highly of the play as Yeats did, but she defended Synge as a matter of principle. Her view of the affair is summed up in a letter to Yeats where she wrote of the riots: \"It is the old battle, between those who use a toothbrush and those who don't.\"\n\nLady Gregory remained an active director of the theatre until ill-health led to her retirement in 1928. During this time she wrote more than 19 plays, mainly for production at the Abbey. Many of these were written in an attempted transliteration of the Hiberno-English dialect spoken around Coole Park that became widely known as Kiltartanese, from the nearby village of Kiltartan. Her plays had been among the most successful at the Abbey in the earlier years, but their popularity declined. Indeed, the Irish writer Oliver St. John Gogarty once wrote \"the perpetual presentation of her plays nearly ruined the Abbey\". In addition to her plays, she wrote a two-volume study of the folklore of her native area called \"Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland\" in 1920. She also played the lead role in three performances of \"Cathleen Ni Houlihan\" in 1919.\n\nDuring her time on the board of the Abbey, Coole Park remained her home; she spent her time in Dublin staying in a number of hotels. For example, at the time of the 1911 national census, she was staying in a hotel at 16 South Frederick Street. In these she dined frugally, often on food she had brought with her from home. She frequently used her hotel rooms to interview would-be Abbey dramatists and to entertain the company after opening nights of new plays. She spent many of her days working on her translations in the National Library of Ireland. She gained a reputation as being a somewhat conservative figure. For example, when Denis Johnston submitted to the Abbey his first play, \"Shadowdance\", it was rejected by Lady Gregory and returned to the author with \"The Old Lady says No\" written on the title page. Johnston decided to rename the play, and \"The Old Lady Says 'No!' \" was eventually staged by the Gate Theatre in 1928.\n\nWhen she retired from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory returned to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and demesne at Coole Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy. Her Galway home had long been a focal point for the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one can still see the carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother Jack, George Moore, Seán O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw, Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: \"The Wild Swans at Coole\", \"I walked among the seven woods of Coole\", \"In the Seven Woods\", \"Coole Park, 1929\" and \"Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931\".\n\nLady Gregory, whom Shaw once described as \"the greatest living Irishwoman\", died at home aged 80 from breast cancer, and is buried in the New Cemetery in Bohermore, County Galway. The entire contents of Coole Park were auctioned three months after her death, and the house was demolished in 1941.\n\nHer plays fell out of favour after her death, and are now rarely performed. Many of the diaries and journals she kept for most of her adult life have been published, providing a rich source of information on Irish literary history during the first three decades of the 20th century.\n\nHer \"Cuchulain of Muirthemne\" is still considered a good retelling of the Ulster Cycle tales such as Deidre, Cuchulainn, and the Táin Bó Cúailnge stories. Thomas Kinsella wrote \"I emerged with the conviction that Lady Gregory's 'Cuchulian of Muirthemne', though only a paraphrase, gave the best idea of the Ulster stories\". However her version omitted some elements of the tale, usually assumed to avoid offending Victorian sensibilities, as well being an attempt as presenting a 'respectable' nation myth for the Irish, though her paraphrase is not considered dishonest. Other critics find the bowdlerisations in her works more offensive, not only the removal of references to sex and bodily functions, but also the loss of Cuchulain's \"battle frenzy\" (\"Ríastrad\"); in other areas she censored less than some of her male contemporaries, such as Standish O'Grady.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He specialised in sculptures of animals, with a particular emphasis on big cats.\n\nAfter spending his childhood in Luxembourg, Auguste Tremont moved to Paris where he enrolled at the Ecole des Arts décoratifs in 1909. World War I caught him by surprise while he was visiting Luxembourg. As he tried to make his way back to Paris by passing through Switzerland, he was arrested by German forces near the Swiss border and was imprisoned. Once released from detention, he returned to Luxembourg where he remained until the end of the war in 1918, working in a steel factory in Dudelange This work gave him the opportunity to practice his skills by drawing pictures of steel workers in action; he also befriended future Arbed president Aloyse Meyer.\n\nAt the end of the war, Trémont returned to Paris where he studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. He first specialized in portraits and pictures of Paris and still life. This changed when he visited the Jardin des Plantes, the zoological gardens, where he found the subjects that were to become his main area of specialization: animals. Later in his life, when asked why he chose to represent animals, he replied: “because it was the most difficult task”.\n\nIn 1924, Trémont made his first sculptures, and he subsequently developed his skills as a sculptor by creating animal sculptures in a variety of sizes and species. The late 1920s-early 1930s were his most productive years; it is during this period that he sculpted, in Paris, two large lions that now decorate the entrance of the Luxembourg City Hall. He spent World War II in Paris, and returned to Luxembourg at the end of the war where he created monuments for the victims of the war. He later returned to his wonderful detailed still life and oil paintings of flowers and portraits. \n\nTremont's work was made available to the public through the Ruhlmann art gallery, then later Edgar Brandt and Malesherbes art galleries. His work is also represented on numerous Luxembourgian stamps.\n\nWorks by Trémont adorn some of the most prominent buildings in his hometown of Luxembourg City , including Notre-Dame Cathedral and Luxembourg City Hall. He also created sculptures for the Luxembourgish pavilions at the Brussels 1935 and Paris 1937 World's Fairs.\n\n\n\nAuguste Trémont, Le grand Animalier, in Les Cahiers luxembourgeois, 1993\n"}

One of his first projects was an electronic mailing list and online music resource, SFRaves, which a friend persuaded him to start in 1992.\nBehlendorf was an early participant and technologist for the Burning Man festival, and founded a large online resource devoted to electronic music and related subcultures.\n\nIn 1993, Behlendorf, Jonathan Nelson, Matthew Nelson and Cliff Skolnick co-founded Organic, Inc., the first business dedicated to building commercial web sites.\nWhile developing the first online, for-profit, media project — the HotWired web site for Wired Magazine — in 1994, they realized that the most commonly used web server software at the time (developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) could not handle the user registration system that the company required. So, Behlendorf patched the open-source code to support HotWired's requirements.\n\nIt turned out that Behlendorf wasn't the only one busy patching the NCSA code at the time, so he and Cliff Skolnick put together an electronic mailing list to coordinate the work of the other programmers.

Somiah was a former Comptroller and Auditor General of India who was known for his honesty and for his impeccable career record. He wrote a best-seller autobiography 'The honest always stand alone'. He had a long career as an IAS officer first in the state of Orissa and next in five central ministries (defense, finance, company affairs, planning and home affairs) of India.\n\nCodanda G Somiah was born on 11 March 1931 as the son of a forest officer who belonged to a family of Kodavas from Madikeri in Kodagu. He obtained his honorary bachelor's degree in Science (Chemistry) from Loyola College, Madras University. He then served as a faculty member of that college briefly before he cleared the Indian Administrative Service examination and joined the service in 1953. He was then made part of the Orissa state cadre. He won the South India Junior Tennis Championship and the All Orissa Badminton Championship in 1956.\n\nSomiah was first posted as assistant commissioner in Orissa. As Collector and Deputy Commissioner at Mayurbhanj in Orissa, Somiah was known for his brilliant sense of humour, his witty remarks and for not losing his cool.\n\nIn Orissa as State Forest Secretary, he took a principled stand against granting concessions to contractors of the \"Kendu\" leaf (a minor forest produce used for wrapping beedis) commodity. It was in 1967 when Maharaja R. N. Singh Deo was the Chief Minister of Orissa. He had wanted Somiah to grant relief to Kendu leaf contractors on grounds of a poor crop that year. But Somiah refused by stating that the contractors had made enormous profits the previous years. He did not agree to reduce or remit the lease-rent as demanded by Kendu leaf contractors as he found their plea of crop failure baseless. By doing so, Somiah had ignored the politically motivated suggestions by the ruling party and did what he thought was right. This vexed the C. M. who later made 'adverse remarks' in Somiah's performance assessment record. Somiah was later transferred to Cuttack where he was made Excise Commissioner. This resulted in having to wait for two years for his name to be cleared of the unnecessary blemish. The contractors had their way and Somiah's promotion was delayed. Somiah's successor complied with Deo and the contractors were given money grants. This blew up into a huge corruption case and Deo's government was toppled. Somiah fought against the 'adverse remarks' made by the 'vengeful' C.M. With the change of guard a commission was appointed to enquire into the Kendu leaf 'scandal' and its report vindicated his position. The Justice Mitter Commission, appointed by the later Congress government, indicted the previous government in granting 'unwarranted and mala fide' relief. He had to thus resist political pressure and risk an adverse entry in his confidential report. Thus his struggle against the politician-contractor nexus on tendu leaves ended with him partly winning.\n\nSomiah was awarded the Queen Elizabeth Fellowship and did his sabbatical at the Oxford University in 1974–1975. Somiah declined an offer to join the Indian Foreign Service.\n\nDuring the Emergency in 1975–1977, he cleared the names of officers and political leaders who were wrongly booked under various offences and were to be subjected to unlawful detentions. He declared to his secretary M L Khurana that it was important for the bureaucracy to apply its mind before taking a decision (based on the words of political leaders).\n\nSomiah was deputed to the Central Government in New Delhi where he had an uninterrupted 15-year stint in various \"Bhavans\" (Government houses and offices) on Raisina Hill until 1996. Somiah worked in association with luminaries such as Nani Palkivala and Ashoke Kumar Sen. Once Dhirubhai Ambani tried to test his integrity by offering him some shares in Reliance out of the promoter's quota. Somiah bluntly refused him.\n\nHe was the financial controller of the Asian Games Organising committee in the 1982 Asian Games held in New Delhi. In 1983 he was appointed Secretary Department of Company Affairs and Chairman of the Company Law Board.\n\nWhile he had a stint in the department of Company Affairs, the exemption limit under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act was raised. So accordingly, when Somiah later became the Home Secretary he found his office room was bugged. He summoned the individual responsible for this and chastised him.\n\nLater when India purchased Czech pistols, Somiah found them to be defective. He worked through the diplomatic channels and got the price refunded from the foreign seller. But he was unnecessarily suspected and a probe was instituted after which he was found to be innocent.\n\nHe was made Secretary of the Planning Commission when Dr. Manmohan Singh was its chairman. He was the Home Secretary under Rajiv Gandhi. He had advised the Central Government during the formulation of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and in deciding the allocation of financial resources for the various State Plans.\n\nHe was later made Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs. As Home Secretary, he led a delegation to Pakistan in 1987 to discuss counter terrorism and the control of narcotics.\n\nHe was also involved in Operation Black Thunder, in fighting terrorism in Punjab and in flushing out terrorists from the Golden Temple. He later paid a visit to the Golden Temple with his wife, to pray and to pay his respects, while his superiors supposedly overlooked the need to do so. His act helped assuage the tense situation in Amritsar.\n\nHe was also involved in controlling the disturbances that occurred in Darjeeling. He was closely involved in signing the Punjab, Assam, Mizo and Gorkhaland accords. On 22 August 1988, the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Treaty was signed inside the throne room in Kolkata's Raj Bhavan by Subhash Ghising (GNLF Chief) on behalf of Darjeeling Gorkhas, C. G. Somiah (Central Home Secretary) on behalf of the Indian Union and Rathindranath Sengupta (Chief Secretary of West Bengal) on behalf the West Bengal State. Home Minister Buta Singh and West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu stood as witnesses. In October 1988, Somiah was made the Central Vigilance Commissioner.\n\nWhen he was part of the home ministry, he rejected the suggestion to ban the religious right of the Coorgs (Kodavas) and the people of Coorg (Kodagu) to possess guns. This religious right is similar to that of the Sikhs to hold the kirpans.\n\nSomiah was as renowned for his modesty as he was for his uprightness. He would dine modestly with his family and drive his personal Maruthi car while not flaunting his status as home secretary. When he once missed a red signal once, he promptly paid the fine on the spot to the constable without making any fuss.\n\nHe was sworn in by the President of India in 1990 to serve a six-year term as Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). He served as the CAG between 27 March 1990 and 11 March 1996. The CAG is ranked 9th in India according to the Indian order of precedence and has the same status as a judge of the Supreme Court of India. As CAG he headed the financial audits of the Central Government, the 26 States and 5 Union Territories of India.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, he was the Chairman of Asian Organisation of Supreme Audit Institution (ASOSAI). He was also elected to the United Nations Board of Auditors for a three-year term from July 1993. In January 1995, he became the Chairman of the UN Board of Auditors or the UN Audit Committee (the first Indian to become so).\n\nHe retired in 1996 and settled down in Bangalore. After retirement he became an avid golfer. In November 2000, the Karnataka state honoured him with the Rajyotsava Prashasti (Rajyotsava award).\n\nHis autobiography 'The honest always stand alone', by Niyogi Publishers, was launched by former President of India Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam in New Delhi on 15 July 2010.\n\nHe died on 13 September 2010, aged 79, after a brief illness. His funeral was attended by several fans, well-wishers and relatives.\n\nHe was succeeded by his wife Indira, son Anand and daughter Pria Alva (the daughter-in-law of Margaret Alva).\n"}

He appeared in twenty films but was only credited for major films such as \"Wild West Days\" (1937), \"For the Service\" (1936), \"Silly Billies\" (1936), \"Custer's Last Stand\" (1936), \"Annie Oakley\" (1935), \"Cyclone of the Saddle\" (1935), \"Laughing Boy\" (1934), and \"Heroes of the West\" (1932).\n\nThunderbird was born on August 6, 1866, near Tongue River, Montana and attended the Carlisle Indian School.\n\nThunderbird made his first appearance in a film in 1914. He played an \"Indian\" (an uncredited role) in the film \"The Perils of Pauline\" \nThunderbird got his first credited roles in the movie \"Heroes of the West\" where he played as Chief Thunderbird. The protagonists of the film included Noah Beery Jr., as Noah Blaine, Julie Bishop as Ann Blaine, Onslow Stevens as Tom Crosby and William Desmond as John Blaine. The film was a classic Western film in which the leading role was known for fighting off the crooks and Indians for the railroad.\n\nThunderbird got his first big role in his next film, \"Laughing Boy\" (1934), where he played Laughing Boy's Father. The film itself was a controversial one, revolving around Ramon Novarro's character, Laughing Boy, who falls in love with Lupe Velez's character, Silly Girl. Laughing Boy's family, of Navaho descent, disapprove of their son's decision to marry a white man's mistress.\n\nThe next film Thunderbird was credited for was \"Cyclone of the Saddle\" (1935) where he starred as High Hawk. The movie itself was about how Rex Lease's character, Andy Thomas, was in charge of getting to the bottom of who was harassing the wagon trains. Thunderbird however did not have much of a commanding role in this film.\n\nLater in 1935, Thunderbird was showcased in his most notable film \"Annie Oakley\" (1935), starring as Chief Sitting Bull. The film, called a \"Western\", takes place in Cincinnati. Thunderbird plays the character of Chief Sitting Bull, a representation of the actual Sitting Bull (1831–1890), a Native American of Sioux descent.\n\nThunderbird next starred in \"Custer's Last Stand\" (1936) as Rain-in-Face. (Chick Davis) however had a very minimal role in the film. The film itself was about how the villains (the Indians) were attacking white men. Blade, the main protagonist steals an Indian medicine arrow. When asked to exchange the arrow for gold, Blade decides to start killing the Indians. Although it is an abysmal role for Thunderbird, it is important to understand the representation of the Native Americans in these films at this time.\n\nThunderbird made his next appearance in 1936 in the film \"Silly Billies\", where he played Chief Cyclone. The two main characters travel to the West to open up a new dentist practice where they find themselves saving the day against the hostile Indians.\n\nThunderbird made another appearance in 1936 in the film \"For the Service\", where he played Chief Big Bear. In this film, main characters, Buck Jones (Buck O'Bryan) and Captain Murphy (Edward Keane) send their troops to go after the outlaw gang, composed of whites and Indian renegades. This film portrays Indians as killers, thieves and all around not intelligent human beings.\n\nThunderbird's last major credited film came in 1937, where he played Chief Red Hatchet in \"Wild West Days\". Like most Westerns of the time, Thunderbird played the side of the villain. In \"Wild West Days\" the Indians plotted alongside the Secret Seven to take over the Munro Ranch.\n\nThunderbird made his last appearance in 1944 in the film \"The Falcon Out West\", where he was uncredited in the role of Eagle Feather. He died two years later on April 6, 1946 in Los Angeles County, California, at the age of 79.\n\nThough Thunderbird acted in twenty films, he never got a commanding role because of discrimination against his Native American race. During his era, Indians were portrayed as rebels, sought out to kill and rob all of the main white protagonists.\n"}

{"id": "10400647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10400647", "title": "Dada Bhagwan", "text": "Dada Bhagwan\n\nDada Bhagwan, also known as Dadashri, born Ambalal Muljibhai Patel, was a spiritual leader from Gujarat, India who founded the Akram Vignan Movement.\n\nAmbalal Muljibhai Patel (A. M. Patel) was born on 7 November 1908 in Tarsali, a village near Baroda (now in Gujarat, India). His parents, Muljibhai and Jhaverba, were Vaishnava Patidars. He grew up in Bhadran, Kheda district in central Gujarat. A. M. Patel credited his mother for instilling an early appreciation of the values of nonviolence, empathy, selfless generosity, and spiritual penance within him. It is said that he was blessed by a saint when he was thirteen who told that he would attain liberation. He married a local village girl named Hiraba in 1924. Their children (born in 1928 and 1931) died a few months after birth so they had no surviving children. During this period, he was also influenced by the writings of Shrimad Rajchandra who was also householder and religious teacher whose teaching inspired new religious movement later. He began practicing temporary celibacy and later vowed lifelong celibacy. He was a contractor by profession. He moved to Bombay where he worked successfully as a contractor for the company Patel & Co. The company used to maintain and construct dry docks in the Bombay harbour.\n\nHe claimed to have attained self-realisation in June 1958 at Surat railway station while sitting on a bench at platform number 3. It was about 6 pm and it lasted 48 minutes. However this was not revealed initially by him.\n\nAfter his experience, a close relative began to address him by the spiritual name of Dada (a Gujarati term for \"Revered Grandfather\") Bhagwan (Lord) became his spiritual name. The experience or self-realization is described as revelation or manifestation of the god within, or pure self, supreme self manifested through body; which he later called \"Dada Bhagwan\". He had differentiated between self and his empirical self as Patel and Dada Bhagwan.\n\nHe left his business to his partners to concentrate on his spiritual goals. He continued to live on the dividends of his shares of company. He continued his householder life as his teaching did not require renunciation or asceticism.\n\nDada Bhagwan formed a movement which he termed Akram Vignan Movement. Unlike the step-by-step purification according to Jain principles, Akram Vignan promises instant salvation through the grace of Simandhar Swami, for whom Dada Bhagwan serves as a medium. His followers believe that they will be reborn in two lives in Mahavideha, a mythical land described in Jain cosmology from where they can achieve Moksha (liberation) as they are in connection with \"Gyani\" (knower). Flügel regards the movement to be a form of Jain-Vaishnava syncretism, a development analogous to the Mahayana in Buddhism.\n\nInitially, he had not revealed his experiences to the public but his some close relatives and friends knew it. In 1962, during a conversation with him, a person name Chandrakant Patel from Uganda experienced sudden self-realization. Such experience is described in traditional Jainism as \"kshayaka samyatva\" which is only achieved in presence of Tirthankara. Kanubhai K. Patel was the second person, who was also his business partner, who received instant knowledge in 1963 from Dada Bhagwan.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1968, very few close people received \"knowledge\" through Dada Bhagwan. Following 1968, he bestowed \"knowledge\" who requested to be blessed. This is the foundation of the movement. He said that he was initially reluctant due to fear of public opinion as in case of Shrimad Rajchandra but after his visit to a Rishabha temple in Khambhat he decided to public performance of \"Gnanvidhi\", a practice to transfer of \"knowledge\" for self-realisation. In 1968, the first \"Gnanvidhi\" was held at Bombay. Over the years, the \"Gnanvidhi\" became more elaborate and achieved its present form in 1983. He continued to give spiritual discourses all over the world. He emphasized contact of \"knower\" (\"jnani\") to gain knowledge over scriptural or ritual knowledge. His followers were initially spread in his hometown Vadodara and Bombay. The movement expanded in the 1960s and 1970s to southern Gujarat and Maharashtra and in Gujarati diaspora in East Africa, North America and UK. In 1983, he had reportedly around 50,000 followers.\n\nWhen he died on 2 January 1988, his funeral was attended by about 60000.\n\nJay Sachchidanand Sangh, the major organisation of Akram Vignan movement, was founded under the auspices of Dada Bhagwan in Mumbai. Khetsi Narsi Shah, head of local Dada Bhagwan Vitarag Trust, was appointed as the first \"sanghpati\", the community leader of it. He was succeeded by G. A. Shah of Ahmedabad. The organisation manages activities, community funds and supervises building activities along with the publication of books and magazine, \"Akram Vignan\" (first published in 1979). Now the organisation is led by local \"sanghpati\"s in Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, London and US.\n\nSoon after the death of Dada Bhagwan, the movement split into two fractions. One led by Kanubhai Patel and backed by Jay Sachchidannad Sangh and other led by Niruben Amin. Niruben claimed that she was instructed and trained in \"Gnanvidhi\" by Dada Bhagwan. Niruben formed her own organisations; Dada Bhagwan Foundation Trust and Simandhar Swami Aradhana Trust in Ahmedabad and Mahavideh Foundation in Mumbai. She became a popular leader of the movement and was addressed as Niruma by her followers from 1999. After death of Niruben in 2006, she was succeeded by Deepakbhai Desai.\n\nKanubhai Patel, also known as Kanudada, was close to Dada Bhagwan before 1978. He claims succession and presents a recorded tape in which he had instructed about it. He is seen as future Tirthankara by his many followers. His fraction refers their teaching of \"Akram Vignan\" as \"Vitrag Vignan\".\n\nIn 2012, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation named a stretch of road between Visat crossroads and Sabarmati crossroads as \"Pujya Dada Bhagwan Road\" and the Zundal circle as Dada Bhagwan circle.\n\nDada Bhagwan was portrayed by Gulshan Grover in a 2012 independent film \"Desperate Endeavors\" directed by French-Algerian director Salim Khassa.\n\nDada Bhagwan has authored the following books now translated in English:\n"}
{"id": "53937399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53937399", "title": "Daniel Irujo Urra", "text": "Daniel Irujo Urra\n\nAlejandro María Daniel Irujo Urra (1862-1911) was a Spanish lawyer. In popular discourse he is known as father of Manuel Irujo Ollo, a Basque political leader. In scholarly historiographic realm he is acknowledged mostly as defense attorney of Sabino Arana during his trials of 1896 and 1902. Politically Irujo is considered a typical case of an identity located in-between Carlism and emerging Spain's peripheral nationalisms, in this case the Basque one.\n\nOrigins of the Irujo family are not clear; some claim they descended from a noble Urra family of Améscoa in Western Navarre. It is certain that in the mid-18th century one branch of the Irujos lived in Tafalla; Daniel’s grandfather, Matías Irujo Pascual (1757-1832), apart from having been an alpargatero owned some 9 ha of vineyards and 12 ha of arable land; he was rich enough to build an own house in the city. Married he had 11 children, born between 1780 and 1803; all except one settled on the rural economy. It is not clear what language was spoken in the family; in the late 18th century Tafalla remained on the borderlines of Basque-speaking zone. The youngest son and Daniel’s father, Manuel Irujo Apastegui (1803-1871), entered the Pamplona seminar but abandoned it and completed law in Zaragoza, where he initially practiced. During the First Carlist War he joined the legitimists holding some admin posts in Estella and suffered some repression afterwards, when back in Tafalla. This did not prevent his law practice and career in local administration, though he failed in a Cortes bid.\n\nIn 1850 Manuel married Engracia Urra Jordan (1825-1885), daughter to an Estella official, whom he probably met during the war. The couple left Tafalla – according to some accounts due to an anti-Carlist backlash suffered – and moved to the bride’s house in Estella. Engaged in local business, Manuel went on as lawyer. In the 1860s elected as mayor for procedural reasons he could not assume the post, yet in 1866 he was elected to , due to poor health barely serving. Manuel and Engracia had 5 children, born between 1850 and 1862; Daniel was the only surviving son. It is not clear whether the family spoke Basque or Spanish; in Estella of the time only few spoke \"en vasco\".\n\nThe young Alejandro María Daniel Irujo and his siblings were brought up in religious ambience. In the mid-1870s he was sent away from Estella, then a Carlist capital, to the Bétharram college near Pau. Prior to 1876 he moved to the Jesuit Orduña establishment, where he met the likes of Sabino Arana and Juan Olazábal. In 1878 he commenced law studies in Valladolid, graduating in derecho civíl y canónico in 1882. Evading military service, in 1883 he settled in Pamplona. Employed by the law office of his brother-in-law, he set up his own office following a move back to Estella in 1885. In 1890 Daniel married Aniana Ollo Elordi (1866-1950), Estella-born daughter of a local pharmacist and concejal. The couple had 10 children, born between 1891 and 1910. Most were engaged in Basque nationalist politics. The best known, Manuel, was minister in the Republican government during the Civil War. Also other sons held posts in Basque Republican administration, two of them – and - known for their contribution to the Basque culture during exile years in Southern America. Some lived long enough to return to Spain following the death of Franco.\n\nIn historiography political antecedents of Daniel are summarized as \"scarcely homogeneous\". Some of his paternal uncles engaged in Tafallese militia and ancestors of his wife were distinguished Estella Liberals. It is clear, however, that the Carlist leaning prevailed; apart from Daniel’s father and other paternal uncles also his maternal uncle, Sebastián Urra Jordán, held various posts in the party and represented it in the Cortes. As it was him appointed by late Manuel cabezalero of his children, Urra has contributed to their Carlist outlook. Already as a child in Carlist-held Estella Daniel used to collect unexploded cartridges fired by the governmental troops to make sure they do not hurt the Carlists, and he admitted to having \"sucked\" Carlism when a child. Education in Orduña college, managed by the Jesuits, is likely to have reinforced this stand; also during academic years in Valladolid Irujo remained in the company of Carlism-minded friends.\n\nNothing is known about Irujo’s engagement either in the Carlist youth organization or in the party structures in the 1880s. However, he demonstrated particular interest in one element of the Carlist political program: restoration of traditional legal provincial establishments, the fueros. He seemed heavily influenced by his brother-in-law Estanislao Aranzadi, co-founder of and its daily, \"Lau-buru\"; politically the grouping tended to fuerismo, with return to foral regime placed as the central if not exclusive objective. Apart from personal links and subscription to fuerista periodicals Irujo did not engage politically before in 1887 he was offered a job in the Jesuit Deusto college. He assumed the chair of Procedimientos Judiciales y Práctica Forense and settled in Bilbao either that year or the following one. His focus on fueros matured into a treaty, produced at unspecified time though most likely in the mid-1890s, and intended as sort of a textbook for his Deusto disciples. It advanced a thesis that until 1839 Navarre and the Vascongadas enjoyed the status of sovereign entities, united with the rest of peninsula mostly by means of personal union. \n\nIn 1893 Navarre was rocked by the so-called , opposition to a ministerial attempt to scrap remnants of the provincial fiscal autonomy. The Carlist deputy to the Cortes from Estella, Juan Vázquez de Mella, in name of \"nosotros, fueristas y regionalistas\" voiced against the project in the parliament, joined by another Carlist and the only non-Navarrese deputy who voted against it, Joaquín Llorens. Irujo most likely remained in touch with the two; when Llorens was cheered in Estella upon return from Madrid, he delivered his triumphant addresses from the balcony of Irujo’s house. Similarly, the following year Irujo was in Castejón, the first major Navarrese train station, organizing welcome of the Navarrese diputación returning from negotiations in Madrid.\n\nWhen in Bilbao Irujo resumed his friendship with the Arana brothers and in 1894 he subscribed to their review \"\", though he did not join the early Basque nationalist organisation, . During Gamazada he introduced Arana to the Navarrese fueristas; it was also in 1894 that at one point, taken over by Arana’s harangue, he declared \"I am your man, though I keep being a Carlist\". His relations with the Aranas got closer; when in 1895 they faced trial, charged with multiple offences related to reportedly Basque-nationalist, anti-Spanish background, Irujo was initially supposed to defend Luis Arana in court. The plan was changed and in 1896 he defended Sabino Arana, freed on bail. Irujo’s defense line was that Arana violated no law; he went on to claim that his client campaigned against 1841 regulations, which he was perfectly entitled to do, apart from representing legitimate aspirations of \"pueblo euskaldun\", embodied in the God and Old Rights slogan. With Irujo fully successful, Arana was absolved.\n\nIn the late 1890s Irujo and the Aranas got even closer. In 1897 Irujo was asked to review \"El Partido Carlista y los Fueros Vasko-Nabarros\", a pamphlet written by Arana and denouncing the Carlist vision as \"plain regionalism\". Formally Irujo was to ensure that the document provides no basis for legal action; it is neither clear whether he contributed to the political content nor how he reconciled the task with his Carlist identity. He helped the Aranas also otherwise, e.g. propagating their new periodical, \"Berritarra\", in Estella, or contributing to pro-nationalist turn of a Pamplona daily \"\". However, Irujo fell short of open political access to the Aranistas and their Partido Nacionalista Vasco. Prior to the 1898 elections to the Sabino Arana suggested that Irujo runs as his representative, but the latter declined the offer. His exact views are not clear; it is not known what his opinion was about the conflict and rapprochement between the Aranistas and Euskalerriacos or general twists and turns of the PNV strategy. At some point between 1899 and 1902 he entered Centro Vasco in Bilbao and subscribed to militant nationalist periodicals, \"La Patria\" and \"Euskalduna\". \n\nIn 1902 Sabino Arana was detained in relation to a telegram message he intended to send to president Roosevelt, congratulating him on recognition of Cuba, until 1898 the Spanish possession. The charges advanced referred to assault on Spanish territorial integrity. The defendant again asked Irujo to represent him. In general terms the defense mounted was very much similar to that of 1896, pointing to Basque rights and revocation of the 1840s regulations; Irujo reiterated his claim that nationalism was not equal to separatism. In terms of specific charges he argued that the telegram message intended expressed admiration and nothing more. At the final stage aided by Teodoro Aguirre, Irujo again emerged triumphant; the defendant was acquitted. He refused to charge his client and maintained close friendship with Sabino Arana until the latter’s death in 1903.\n\nThroughout the entire Bilbao period Irujo maintained close links with Navarre and with Estella. Around 1904 he returned to his native city; exact reasons remain unclear and perhaps are related to taking care of local family business. He re-entered the local Carlist círculo; around that time the Carlist jefe in Vascongadas, Tirso Olazábal, offered him the party jefatura in the and Irujo accepted. For the first time he also openly engaged in political strife. In the local realm dominated by the Conservatives and the Carlists, in 1905 he decided to represent the latter when running for the Estella ayuntamiento; PNV at the time did not have its representatives in the area and explicitly banned their sympathizers from voting other parties. Irujo was successful and though initially his mandate was revoked on procedural ground, he was eventually reinstated in early 1906. In line with official requirements, he declared his political affiliation as Carlist. The first year of his tenure was a routine one, perhaps except minor Carlist political demonstrations he took part in.\n\nIn 1908 the Aranista Centro Vasco of Bilbao used the services of Irujo’s brother-in-law Aranzadi to offer the Estella city a shoot from the Guernica oak, a symbol of vasco-navarrese fueros. Irujo passed the proposal to ayuntamiento, which accepted the offer and in a pompous ceremony few months later planted the shoot at a patio of a local school. Navarrese press remained largely sympathetic, but a Liberal daily raised alarm, claiming that the local self-government fuels Basque separatism. As nationwide press followed suit the issue turned into a scandal, especially that the ceremony was marked by Basque and Navarrese flavor with almost total absence of official references to Spain; moderate Irujo’s address was interrupted by angry \"Viva España!\" cries from the disgusted crowd. The council declared they had been unaware that the shoot originated from Centro Vasco and suggested having been maneuvered into a separatist affair, blaming Aranzadi and Irujo for the miscommunication.\n\nAt the council sittings and in the press Irujo claimed that ayuntamiento was perfectly aware of the shoot origins, yet his arguments were rejected. The shoot was sent back to Centro Vasco and replaced by new ones, officially provided by the Biscay diputación. They were planted 3 weeks after the first ceremony. The re-implantation was an equally public though somewhat less pompous event; this time the Spanish and Navarrese features were carefully balanced, while the Basque ones were absent. Embittered with the city council blaming him for the affair, in the immediate aftermath Irujo ceased to attend its sittings, excusing himself for the absence. Later in 1908 the ayuntamiento admitted he was right, but this did not make Irujo change his mind. In early 1909 the mayor and his deputy resigned; technically, as segundo teniente de alcalde Irujo was becoming the interim alcalde. At this point he formally resigned his counselor mandate and did not stand in the successive elections of May 1909.\n\nInitially the Carlist \"\" acknowledged the first implantation with sympathy, praising the homage to \"nuestras libertades tradicionales\" and complaining only about lack of Irujo’s references to Carlist champions of Navarrese rights like Llorens. However, soon the party press – especially in Vascongadas – assumed a hostile tone; the Gipuzkoan \"\" lambasted Irujo as \"concejal reaccionario\" and \"\" linked the event to venomous anti-Spanish separatism. Carlist circles and provincial leaders were sending messages congratulating the ayuntamiento on their decision to send the original shoot back. Another Carlist in the council, Nicanor Larráinzar Senosiáin, led an all-out charge on Irujo, also publicly, claiming that his support for the Aranistas was incompatible with Carlism. Irujo denied separatist charges, charged his opponent with political opportunism and initially confirmed his Carlist identity. Things changed when Tirso Olazábal congratulated Larráinzar on his stand. In a public letter to Olazábal Irujo considered himself disauthorised; speculating that apparently he had been erroneous as to fuerista objectives of the Carlists, he declared leaving Carlism.\n\nIn a letter to Luis Arana Irujo proclaimed that from then on he would not be any \"carlo-bizkaitarra\", but \"nacionalista vasco a secas\". However, when in late 1908 offered a post in Navarrese Partido Nacionalista Vasco structures, he declined. The reasons are not clear. Some scholars speculate that aware of growing controversy between Arana and Aranzadi, Irujo could have not brought himself to taking a stand; another reason might have been growing rivalry between a radical Navarrese wing of Evangelista de Ibero and a more moderate one championed by his brother-in-law. Nevertheless, he remained in touch with PNV activists both in Navarre and in Biscay. When their new Navarrese periodical \"Napartarra\" was launched in 1911, Irujo featured as one of its collaborators. Some students speculate that had it not been for his premature death, Irujo would have represented the Nationalists in forthcoming elections.\n\nOne scholar concludes that indeed, apparent Irujo’s attempt to match Nationalist and Carlist objectives was mission impossible. He identifies Irujo's political position as \"radical fuerismo\", its essence being reversal to pre-1839 regime. Deprived of anti-Spanish venom and far from classic separatism, it envisioned Vasco-Navarrese area as sovereign entities united with other Spanish political bodies by a common monarch. It also did not include \"los aspectos más negativos del aranismo\", i.e. racism. It is not clear to what extent Irujo embraced nationalism as emerging in Europe of the time. He certainly acknowledged and appreciated separated Basque identity, yet it seems that his vision of Basque commonality was based on geography, religion, history and culture rather than on ethnicity. On the other hand, he hailed the newly invented icon of Basque nationalism, ikurriña, and called for unification of all Basques in \"tierra euzkeriana\". Another scholar considers Irujo a typical case of transitory identity from Carlism to peripheral nationalism, parallel to those of Vayreda (Catalonia), (Galicia) and Pereda (Cantabria). One more author considers Irujo irrelevant when discussing relations between \"fuerismo tradicionalista\" and \"nacionalismo vasco\".\n\n\n\n"}

Christie had an elder brother, John Coldwells who died in childhood in his twelfth year in 1872, and a younger sister, Alice Margaret. In 1865 Christie's father purchased the Castleton estate in the Ochils, renaming it Cowden Castle, and the family moved there. Christie and her sister were educated at home by her parents and governesses. From an early age she made annual trips with her parents to Europe including Spain, Italy, Germany and the Low Countries. After her mother's death and her sister's marriage Christie continued to travel with her father and also alone or with a friend. She visited Egypt, Palestine and Syria and started to write about her trips.\n\nOn her father's death in 1902 it was found that he had disinherited both Christie and her sister, leaving the entirety of his estate to an orphanage that he had founded without their knowledge. They contested the will and in 1903 it was settled with the estate being divided between the two sisters and the orphanage. Ella lived on at Cowden Castle and managed the estate.\n\nAfter her father's death Christie's travels became more ambitious and she began to travel more widely. From 1904 to 1905 she travelled with her maid, Humphries, initially to India and then on to Kashmir, Tibet, Ceylon, Malaya and Borneo. Being well connected and carrying letters of introduction she attended a banquet with the maharaja of Kashmir and dined with Lord Kitchener. Her adventures saw her camping in the snow at Chorbat Pass, sailing in a cargo ship full of pigs, travelling by pack horse and cart in the Kashmir wilderness and trekking by foot for 60 miles in the Desoi mountains.\n\nIn 1907 she visited China, Korea and Japan. While in Japan Christie was fascinated by the Japanese formal style of gardening, an interest that would inspire her to create a Japanese garden at Cowden Castle.\n\nIn 1910 she packed a camp bed, stove, lamp, oatmeal and biscuits and travelled to Russian Turkestan. Her journey took her to Constantinople across the Black Sea, through Georgia to the Caspian Sea and onwards to Ashkabad and Merv. She travelled by train and boat along the Silk Road, visiting Buhkhara, Samarkand, Kokand, and finally to Andhizan.\n\nChristie undertook a further trip to the Russian Empire in 1912. Starting in Saint Petersburg she travelled by train, steamer and droshky to Tashkent, Samarkand and Khiva. She was the first British woman to ever visit Khiva.\n\nIn 1914 she visited the United States and Cuba.\n\nChristie kept an account of her travels in her diaries and she was in regular correspondence with her sister. She later wrote about her trips to the Russian Empire in the book \"Through Khiva to golden Samarkand\".\n\nIn 1916, Christie travelled to France to become the manager of the \"L'Oeuvre de la Goutte de Café\" at Bar-sur-Aube. This network of cafés was established by the French and British Red Cross as a places for tired soldiers to relax and rest. The café that Christie managed was staffed by five Scottish women and served the soldiers fighting at the Battle of Verdun. From 1918-1919 Christie oversaw another \"'LOuevre de la Goutte de Café\" at Mulhouse.\n\nAfter her visit to Japan in 1907 Christie was inspired to create a seven-acre Japanese garden at her home at Cowden Castle. She employed Taki Handi, from the Royal School of Garden Design in Nagoya, to help plan and design the garden. The burn on the estate was dammed and a hollow made to create an artificial loch and a pond and island garden was developed along with a stroll garden and a tea-house garden. Plants, shrubs, trees and a traditional stone lantern were imported from Japan. The garden was named \"Shāh-raku-en\" meaning a place of pleasure or delight.\n\nChristie was advised on the form, maintenance and development of the garden by Professor Jijo Soya Suzuki, Master of the Soami School of Imperial Design. Suzuki considered the garden to the best Japanese garden in the Western world. Shinzaburo Matsuo lived and worked at Cowden as gardener from 1925 until his death in 1937. Queen Mary visited the garden in the late 1930s.\n\nAfter Christie's death in 1949 the garden was maintained by workers on the Cowden estate. In 1963 it was vandalised and the teahouses and bridges were burned and the lanterns and shrines knocked into the loch.\n\nIn 2014 Christie's great great niece Sara Stewart started a fundraising campaign to raise £1,000,000 to restore the garden.\n\nChristie was a fellow Royal Geographical Society of Scotland, she was a member of council and in November 1934 she became a vice-president of the Society. She was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.\n\nOn 15 January 1913 the Royal Geographical Society voted to allow women to be elected to become members of the Society. On 10 February 1913 Christie was in the first cohort of women to be elected Fellows.\n\nChristie died of leukemia on the 29 January 1949 at Strathearn Road, Edinburgh.\n\nChristie authored and co-authored several books about her travels, two of which she wrote with her sister, Alice.\n"}

The word derives from the Arabic word for \"ploughman\" or \"tiller\".\n\nA fellah could be seen wearing a simple cotton robe called \"galabieh\" (jellabiya). The word \"Galabieh\" originated around 1715–25 and derived from the Egyptian Arabic word \"gallabīyah\" (جلابية).\n\nFellahin was the term used throughout the Middle East in the Ottoman period and later to refer to villagers and farmers. Nur-eldeen Masalha translates it as \"peasants,\".\n\nFellahin were distinguished from the \"effendi,\" or, land-owning class, although the fellahin in this region might be tenant farmers, smallholders, or live in a village that owned the land communally. Others applied the term \"fellahin\" only to landless workers. The term \"fallahin\" applied to Christian, Druze, Jewish and Muslim villagers. The term \"fallah\" was applied to people from several regions in the Middle East, including those of Egypt, Levant, Iraq and Cyprus.\n\nComprising 60% of the Egyptian population in both Lower and Upper Egypt, the fellahin lead humble lives and continue to live in mud-brick houses like their ancient ancestors. Their percentage was much higher in the early 20th century, before the large influx of Egyptian fellahin into urban towns and cities. In 1927, anthropologist Winifred Blackman, author of \"The Fellahin of Upper Egypt\", conducted ethnographic research on the life of Upper Egyptian farmers and concluded that there were observable continuities between the cultural and religious beliefs and practices of the fellahin and those of ancient Egyptians.\n\n\n"}

Hamengkubuwono X was formally installed as Sultan on 7 March 1989. However, the position of the Governor of the Yogyakarta Special Region did not go to Hamengkubuwono X. Vice Governor Sri Paku Alam VIII, prince of the subordinate enclave of Paku Alaman within Yogyakarta was instead controversially elevated to the position of governor. This was in contrary to the agreement made at the independence of Indonesia in recognition of Hamengkubuwono IX's support and role in the Indonesian War of Independence. Under the agreement, the Yogyakarta Sultan holds the position of governor in the Yogyakarta Special Region, and the Paku Alam holds the position of vice governor.\n\nAfter the fall of the Suharto regime in May 1998, and following the death of Sri Paku Alam VIII on 11 September 1998, the central government required an election be held for the post of Yogyakarta Governor.

He was born in Lagoa da Canoa, Alagoas, Brazil. Pascoal is a beloved figure in the history of Brazilian music, known for his abilities in orchestration and improvisation, as well as being a record producer and contributor to many Brazilian and international albums by other artists.\n\nPascoal comes from a remote corner of northeastern Brazil, an area that lacked electricity at the time he was born. He learned the accordion from his father and practised for hours indoors as, being albino, he was incapable of working in the fields with the rest of his family.\n\nHermeto's career began in 1964 with appearances on several Brazilian recordings alongside relatively unknown groups. These now-classic albums and the musicians involved (Edu Lobo, Elis Regina, Cesar Camargo Mariano) established widely influential new directions in post-bossa nova Brazilian jazz.\n\nIn 1966, he played in the Sambrasa Trio, with Airto Moreira and Humberto Clayber; they released only one album, \"Em Som Maior\". Then he joined Trio Novo (Airto Moreira, Heraldo do Monte, Theo de Barros) and in 1967 the group, renamed Quarteto Novo, released an album that launched the careers of Pascoal and Moreira. Pascoal would then go on to join the multi-faceted group Brazilian Octopus.\n\nPascoal initially caught the international public's attention with an appearance on Miles Davis's 1971 album \"Live-Evil\", which featured him on three pieces, which he also composed. Davis said that Pascoal was \"the most impressive musician in the world\". Later collaborations involved fellow Brazilian musicians Airto Moreira and Flora Purim. From the late 1970s onward he has mostly led his own groups, playing at many prestigious venues, such as the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1979. Other members of the group have included bassist Itibere Zwarg, pianist Jovino Santos-Neto and percussionists Nene, Pernambuco and Zabele.\n\nKnown as \"o Bruxo\" (the Sorcerer), Pascoal often makes music with unconventional objects such as teapots, children's toys, and animals, as well as keyboards, button accordion, melodica, saxophone, guitar, flute, voice, various brass and folkloric instruments. Perhaps because he grew up in the countryside, he uses nature as a basis for his compositions, as in his \"Música da Lagoa\", in which the musicians burble water and play flutes while immersed in a lagoon: a Brazilian television broadcast from 1999 showed him soloing at one point by singing into a cup with his mouth partially submerged in water. Folk music from rural Brazil is another important influence in his work.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1997, Pascoal worked on a book project called \"Calendário do Som\", which contains a song for every day of the year, including 29 February, so that everyone would have a song for his or her birthday.\n\nHermeto was married to Ilza da Silva, to whom he dedicated many compositions, from 1954 until her death in 2000. They had six children, Jorge, Fábio, Flávia, Fátima, Fabiula and Flávio, and many grandchildren. He was married Aline Morena from 2003 until 2016, while living in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. He has since returned to the Jabour neighborhood in Bangu, Rio de Janeiro, where he spent much of his time living, composing, rehearsing and hosting musicians from all over the world.\n\n\n\n"}

(born in Bireuën, Aceh, Indonesia; 2 August 1960), is an Indonesian politician who served as Governor of Aceh province in north Sumatra. He was re-elected Governor in early 2017 after serving an earlier term between 2006 and 2012.\n\nIrwandi first won a term as governor in the 2006 Aceh regional election as an independent candidate (non-party). Muhammad Nazar, S. Ag. was his running mate in 2006. However Irwandi lost his 2012 re-election campaign to Zaini Abdullah following a strong challenge and intensive campaigning by other local political rivals. Allegations that he may have wrongfully granted land concessions involving previously protected high conservation value land to palm oil companies also surfaced before the campaign. In 2017, he was reelected as the Governor of Aceh, with Nova Iriansyah as his partner.\n\nIn 2018, the former Free Aceh Movement (GAM) leader is the second Aceh governor implicated in a corruption case after Abdullah Puteh, who was sentenced to 10 years for graft surrounding the procurement of an MI-2 Rostov helicopter worth US$872,500.\n\nIrwandi was arrested and caught red handed in a corruption transaction, along with Bener Meriah Regent Ahmadi and eight other individuals following a suspicious transaction involving provincial and regency officials, according to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). Since Irwandi was caught red-handed by the KPK, he started to lose supports from Acehnese people. He is now still in jail and going through his trial with a possibility of serving 6 years of jail time without parole.\n\nIrwandi Yusuf, a veterinarian (Alumnus of Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh), joined the Free Aceh Movement ( or GAM) in 1990, participating for three years before taking up a scholarship at Oregon State University, US, in 1993, where he undertook a master's degree in Veterinary Science.\n\nAfter returning to Banda Aceh to teach at his alma mater, Irwandi became a founding member of the Acehnese branch of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (now known as Fauna and Flora International), lending his veterinary expertise to their conservation campaigns.\n\nIn 2018, the former Free Aceh Movement (GAM) leader is the second Aceh governor implicated in a corruption case after Abdullah Puteh, who was sentenced to 10 years for graft surrounding the procurement of an MI-2 Rostov helicopter worth US$872,500.\n\nIrwandi was arrested along with Bener Meriah Regent Ahmadi and eight other individuals following a suspicious transaction involving provincial and regency officials, according to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). Since Irwandi was caught red-handed by the KPK, he started to lose supports from Acehnese people. \n\nIn the past, his concern for Acehnese socio-political issues led him into further contact with GAM. He held several different positions in the movement, including as a special staff office for psy warfare in the Central GAM command, as negotiation coordinator, and as Expert Staff on counter-intelligence in the Central Command of the Aceh National Army. He spent some time in 2001 with the Red Cross, taking the opportunity to study humanitarian law. Irwandi was arrested in 2003, and was held as a war prisoner in the Keudah Prison in Banda Aceh.\n\nIrwandi was in his jail cell when the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake struck. The epicentr of the quake was close to the Acehnese coastline. The population of Aceh before the December 2004 tsunami was 4,271,000 (2004). The population as of 15 September 2005 was 4,031,589; a discrepancy of 239,411 lives. 170,000 people were confirmed dead.\n\nAs the tsunami's waters rose inside the prison, Irwandi fled to the Musholla (prayer room) on the second floor while walls crumbled around him. His only means of escape was to punch a hole through the asbestos ceiling, scramble onto the roof, and hang on until the tsunami abated.\nOut of the prison population of 278, Irwandi was one of just 40 survivors.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tsunami, GAM and the Indonesian central command negotiated a peace settlement, and Irwandi renounced his separatist agenda. No longer in conflict with the Indonesian government, the former rebel liaised with the international NGOs whose presence paved the way for Aceh's first democratic election in almost 30 years. It was a landslide victory for Irwandi, who won 39.3% of the popular vote, as announced by Public Issue Network (JIP) and Indonesian Survey Circle (LSI).\n\nHe took office in 8 February 2007 and established a normal relationship with the army that once pursued him as a GAM rebel. In an unusual move for a former revolutionary, he kept much of the old administration in place although he also moved to reform a range of positions in the senior ranks of the provincial public service. In a 2007 New York Times interview, Irwandi said, \"I tell them, 'I believe, I trust you all. You are all trustworthy until you prove otherwise. Then I will know.'\" In the same interview, he remarked that his former enemies in the cabinet were welcome to 'rock and roll' with him – \"Rock and roll... That means to do something new, rocky, that was never felt before. It is spirit. Spirited people. Young blood. Young spirit.\" His first term expired on 8 February 2012, and later he lost his reelection run against Zaini Abdullah.\n\nIn July 2018, he was arrested by the Corruption Eradication Commission, after allegedly having caught red-handed receiving bribes.\n\nOne of Governor Irwandi's declared priorities was the protection of Aceh's magnificent rainforest. \"This is my obsession, since a long time ago – that Aceh is Aceh, and the forests of Aceh need to be kept well.\" His first step as a green governor was to embrace the establishment of carbon trading in Aceh using the \"REDD\" mechanism, (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) to reinvigorate the faltering economy and prevent further destruction of Aceh's rainforests.\n\nIrwandi declared a moratorium on all logging in Aceh in March 2007, and personally drove out to villages to conduct spot inspections of former logging camps, encouraging the locals to take up sustainable new professions.\n\nHowever, in 2011, Irwandi's apparent pro-environmental efforts were abruptly halted and reversed. He allegedly surprised supporters when information was uncovered that, on 25 August 2011, he had quietly granted a concession to palm oil supplier PT Kallista Alam which authorised the destruction of a peat swamp forest that is one of the last refuges of the critically endangered Sumatran orangutan. Some of the indigenous peoples took the about-face from the so-called 'Green Governor' personally, calling it a betrayal of their homeland and of his previous environmental credentials. On a legal level, though, many environmental organisations argued that Irwandi's decision breached a presidential moratorium – part of an international deal to save Indonesia's forests – as well as legislation protecting a conservation area where the Tripa swamp is located. Litigation was filed by environmental groups known as WAHLI, challenging the legality of this concession and contending it was granted in an area of protected forest and further violated a moratorium on peatlands conversion.\n\nOn 27 March 2012, on the eve of the WAHLI case being heard in court, over seventy illegally set fires mysteriously broke out in this protected Tripa swamp area, including fires set in the oil palm concession granted by Irwandi to PT. Kallista Alam. Many involved with the WAHLI litigation believed the fires were set in direct defiance of the pending litigation, in effect ignoring any eventual ruling on the alleged legality of Irwandi's granted concession. Mainstream media outlets and environmental organisations report that these fires could lead to the imminent and immediate extinction of the animal inhabitants of the Tripa swamp, including over 200 orangutans.\nOn 3 April 2012, the Council of Judges of the Banda Aceh National Administrative Court dismissed the WALHI case on jurisdictional grounds. WALHI was expected to appeal. The court acknowledged that the permit that Irwandi approved allowing PT Kallista Allam to convert the Tripa peat swamp into palm oil plantations was indeed located inside the protected Leuser Ecosystem and thus in violation of current Indonesian law. Some legal observers considered the lack of a decision by the court as a case of inappropriate behaviour because it refused to reach a ruling even though the case had been running for nearly five months.\n\nIrwandi had spoken out amid the considerable attention that emerged in the wake of the Tripa peat swamp fires and the WALHI litigation. In reports on 5 April 2012, Irwandi claimed that the land grant, while legal, was 'immoral' yet intended by him to bring world attention to global inability to tackle global climate change, in effect destroying the Tripa forests to save them. Irwandi was quoted as saying, \"That concession, 1,600 hectares, was like a pinch to the international community. Maybe I will make a threat to lift the moratorium [entirely] to make them look at Aceh.\" He also denied that any orangutans had died in the fires despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nLater, after Irwandi had left office, the apparent over-exploitation of the Tripa forest area continued to attract comment. In July 2012 it was reported that officials from the national Environment Ministry who visited the Tripa area said that there were 'strong indications' that deliberate burning had been taking place in the region to convert the area to an oil palm plantation,\n\nOn 30 August 2012, judges of the Higher Administrative Court in Medan granted the WAHLI appeal, casting further doubt on Yusuf's one-time claims to be the \"Green Governor.\" The ruling contained among other things: 1) the granting of the WALHI appeal; 2)cancellation of the contested Tripa license issued by the Governor of Aceh (then Yusuf) on 25 August 2011; 3) an order to the current governor of Aceh to withdraw the contested State Administrative Decision issued by Yusuf on the plantation permit to PT. Kalista Alam issued on 25 August 2011; 4) and an order that the Defendants jointly cover the cost of both court process.\n\nOn 9 April 2012 Irwandi lost the re-election campaign that would have allowed him to continue as governor of Aceh. Irwandi claimed voter fraud and voter intimidation was the cause of his loss. Zaini Abdullah,\nthe new governor of Aceh elected to replace Irwandi, took office on 25 June 2012. Zaini, then 72, was the former GAM foreign minister in exile in Sweden before the signing of the 2005 Indonesian government-GAM peace agreement in Helsinki. Deputy Governor Muzakir Manaf, then 48, was the former commander of GAM's Armed Wing.\n\nDespite a guarantee from incoming deputy governor Muzakir Manaf that Irwandi's safety would be guaranteed if he attended the inauguration of the new provincial government in June 2012, following the event Irwandi was surrounded and beaten about the face and head by uniformed Aceh Party supporters. He was accused of being a traitor to GAM, the Acehnese militia, because of his negotiations and compromises with the Indonesian government. Irwandi's own governorship campaign in 2006 had been as an independent candidate, not with his former rebel comrades, a fact exploited by the Aceh Party (PA) during the 2012 election campaign to sway popular opinion in their direction. Irwandi stated that the PA's propaganda implying that he betrayed GAM was the cause of the attack by party supporters. Only one arrest was made.\n"}

She is currently the Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha from the Samajwadi Party, notably serving four terms since 2004. She is recognised as one of the finest Hindi film actresses of her time, particularly known for reinforcing a naturalistic style of acting in both mainstream and \"middle-of-the-road\" cinema. During her career, she won nine Filmfare Awards: including three for Best Actress and three for Best Supporting Actress, which makes her the overall most-awarded performer in the female acting categories, along with Nutan. She was awarded the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007. In 1992, she was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India.\n\nMaking her film debut as a teenager in Satyajit Ray's \"Mahanagar\" (1963), Bachchan's first screen role as an adult was in \"Guddi\" (1971), directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, with whom she would collaborate in several films. She was noted for her performances in films including \"Uphaar\" (1971), \"Koshish\" (1972) and \"Kora Kagaz\" (1974), among others. She appeared alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in films such as \"Zanjeer\" (1973), \"Abhimaan\" (1973), \"Chupke Chupke\" (1975), \"Mili\" (1975) and \"Sholay\" (1975).\n\nFollowing her marriage to actor Amitabh Bachchan and the birth of their children, Bachchan restricted her work in films. After her appearance in the \"Silsila\" (1981), she took an indefinite sabbatical from films. She returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's \"Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa\" in 1998. Since then, she has appeared in several critically and commercially successful films such as \"Fiza\" (2000), \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...\" (2001) and \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" (2003), all which garnered her critical acclaim, as well as several awards and nominations.\n\nJaya Bachchan, an alumna of the Film and Television Institute of India, started her career with a supporting role in Satyajit Ray's Bengali film, \"Mahanagar\"(1963) at the age of 15, with Anil Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee. After that, she had appeared in two Bengali films: a 13-minute short film, \"Suman\", and a Bengali comedy Dhanyee Meye (1971), as Uttam Kumar's sister-in-law.\n\nInspired by her experience with Ray, she decided to join the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune to learn acting, and passed with the gold medal. She was also picked out to play the eponymous role of \"Guddi\" in the 1971 Hrishikesh Mukherjee film, \"Guddi\" in which she played a schoolgirl obsessed with film star Dharmendra. Guddi was a success, and she moved to Mumbai and soon picked other roles, however her role of a 14-year-old schoolgirl, aided by her petite looks, created the girl-next-door image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. Though she tried to break out of the mould with glamorous roles as in \"Jawani Diwani\", (1972) and a negative character of the heroine faking amnesia, in \"Anamika\" (1973), she was mostly recognised for roles of the sort which were credited with epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of \"middle-cinema\" directors such as Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee and indeed Hrishikesh Mukherjee. These films include \"Uphaar\" (1971), \"Piya Ka Ghar\" (1972), \"Parichay\" (1972), \"Koshish\" (1972) and \"Bawarchi\" (1972), performed with marked sensitivity. By now, she was a popular star.\n\nIn Gulzar's \"Koshish\" (1973), Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as handicapped people. She described the film as \"a learning experience\" which motivated her to do social work in future.\n\nShe first acted with her future husband Amitabh Bachchan in the film \"Bansi Birju\" (1972), followed by B.R. Ishara's \"Ek Nazar\" also in the same year. Amitabh had undergone a string of flops, and when most lead heroines refused to work with him in the Salim-Javed scripted \"Zanjeer\" (1973), she stepped into the film. The film turned out to be a hit and gave rise to Amitabh Bachchan's angry-young-man image. This was closely followed by their pairing in films such as \"Abhimaan\" (1973), \"Chupke Chupke\" (1975) and \"Sholay\" (1975).\n\nHer daughter Shweta was born while Jaya and Amitabh were working on \"Sholay\". Following this, she retired from films and focused on raising her children. Her last film as a lead actress was \"Silsila\" (1981), opposite her husband. During the late 1980s, she wrote the story for the film \"Shahenshah\" (1988), which starred her husband in the lead.\n\nAfter a gap in film appearances of 18 years, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's \"Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa\" (1998), a film about the Naxalite movement. In 2000 she starred in \"Fiza\" for which she received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for her work. She also starred in Karan Johar's family drama \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...\" (2001) with her husband. She then starred in Karan Johar's next film, \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" (2003) playing the role of Preity Zinta's mother, Jennifer Kapur, for which she again received a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. She appeared with her son Abhishek in the films \"Laaga Chunari Mein Daag\" (2007) and \"Drona\" (2008).\n\nIn 2011, she appeared in the Bangladeshi film \"Meherjaan\" starring with Victor Banerjee and Humayun Faridi. The film is based on a Bangladesh-Pakistan love story in the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities. It is the story of Meherjaan (played by Jaya Bachchan), a Bangladeshi woman who falls in love with a Pakistani army officer, who refuses to join the war and saves her from being raped by other Pakistani troops, who do not however spare her cousin Neela and kill her father.\n\nBachchan was first elected in 2004 as the Member of Parliament from the Samajwadi Party, representing Uttar Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha till March 2006. She got a second term from June 2006 till July 2010 and in February 2010 she stated her intent to complete her term. She was re-elected in 2012 for the third term and again in 2018 for her fourth term in the Rajya Sabha from Samajwadi Party.\n\nBachchan's speech during the musical launch of the film \"Drona\" in the second half of 2008 was criticized by some sections of politicians in Maharashtra. In response to the film's director, Goldie Behl, making his introductory speech in English, she said \"Hum UP ke log hain, isliye Hindi mein baat karenge, Maharashtra ke log maaf kijiye\". (We are from UP, so we will speak in Hindi. People of Maharashtra, please excuse us.) Subsequently, she encouraged actress Priyanka Chopra to speak in Hindi. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray commented that Jaya had no business alluding to all the people of Maharashtra in that statement. He threatened to ban all Bachchan films unless Jaya apologized in a public forum for hurting Maharashtrians. MNS workers began to attack theaters screening \"The Last Lear\" starring her husband, Amitabh Bachchan. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut also criticized her statement saying: \"After making all your success and fortune in Mumbai, if you feel like saying that we are from UP, it's very unfortunate.\" Amitabh Bachchan tendered an apology for her statements on her behalf.\n\nOn 3 June 1973, she married actor Amitabh Bachchan. The couple has two children: Shweta Bachchan-Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan, who is also an actor. Shweta is married to industrialist Nikhil Nanda of the Kapoor family in Delhi, and has two children, Navya Naveli and Agastya Nanda, while Abhishek Bachchan is married to Aishwarya Rai, and has a daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan.\nCivilian Award\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\nWinner\n\nNominated\n\nInternational Indian Film Academy Awards\n\nWinner\n\nOther film awards\n\nWinner\n\nHonours and recognitions\n\n"}

He is one of the seven monstrous children of Tau and Kerana, and as such is one of the central legendary figures in the region of Guaraní speaking cultures. He is also one of the few figures still prominent in the modern culture of the region.\nKurupi is said to be somewhat similar in appearance to another, more popular figure from Guaraní mythology, the Pombero. Like the Pombero, Kurupi is said to be short, ugly, and hairy. He makes his home in the wild forests of the region, and was considered to be the lord of the forests and protector of wild animals. Kurupi's most distinctive feature, however, was an humongous penis that was ordinarily wound several times around his waist like a belt. Due to this feature, he was at one time revered by the Guaraní as the spirit of fertility.\n\nMuch like the Pombero, Kurupi is often blamed for unexpected or unwanted pregnancies. His penis is said to be prehensile, and owing to its length he is supposed to be able to extend it through doors, windows, or other openings in a home and impregnate a sleeping woman without even having to enter the house. Together with the Pombero, Kurupi was a scapegoat used by adulterous women to avoid the wrath of their husbands, or by single women to explain their pregnancies. Children fathered by the Kurupi were expected to be small, ugly and hairy much like their father, and if male to inherit something of their father's virility. In some cases, Kurupi is blamed with the disappearance of young women, supposedly stealing them away to his home in the forest for use in satiating his libidinous desires (rape).\n\nThe legend of Kurupi has faded somewhat in comparison to the Pombero, and figures more often as part of old tales. Rarely is he blamed with impregnating women anymore, although he is sometimes used to try and frighten young girls into being chaste.\n\n"}

The Carrera family is of Basque origin.\n\nLuis Carrera was born in Santiago, the youngest son of Ignacio de la Carrera y Cuevas and of Francisca de Paula Verdugo Fernández de Valdivieso y Herrera. Carrera completed his first studies at the \"Convictorio Carolino\", the best school in the country at the time. In 1813 – at the beginning of the Chilean War of Independence – he participated in the first encounter between the Patriot and Royalist troops at the Battle of Yerbas Buenas, as a commander of an artillery platoon. That same year he also participated in the disastrous Siege of Chillán, one of the most negative early experiences for the nascent Chilean Army, where after a long siege of the Spanish troops that were barricaded inside the city, the army had to withdraw in the midst of winter that same year.

She was the daughter of the well-known and well-to-do Presbyterian pastor Abbott Eliot Kittredge. She was raised in New York City and lived there for most of her adult life.\n\nAs a teenager she studied at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut.\n\nKittredge advocated for school lunches and started the hot-lunch program in New York City public schools in 1901. Afterwards, she continued develop the program for the next two decades, finally succeeding in getting it funded by the Board of Education in 1920.\n\nKittredge helped to financially support the Henry Street Settlement founded by her close friend Lillian Wald, and even lived at the settlement briefly in the early 1900s.\n\nKittredge became a household adviser because she believed in the importance of the home in national life and because she was shocked by the conditions in which many immigrants lived. Like Christine Frederick, she aimed to improve household management in the United States, with a focus on making better, safer food and furnishings available to women with little money and teaching them up-to-date household management techniques.\n\nUnder the umbrella title Association of Practical Housekeeping Centers, she established the first of several \"model flats\" in a New York City tenement in 1902, declaring: \"If household administration is to take its place in the front rank with the other professions of the day, educators as well as women must wake up and realize that the whole housekeeping question is dependent upon scientific management, efficiency, skilled labor, and effective tools.\"\n\nHer 1911 book \"Housekeeping Notes: How to Furnish and Keep House in a Tenement Flat\" was a compendium of household management lessons taught in these centers, and her 1918 book \"The Home and Its Management\" offered practical advice on thrift in furnishing a home as well as in shopping for daily necessities. She became the most famous home economist (also known then as home adviser) of her day.\n\nIn 1915, she attended the International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom at the Hague. She went overseas during World War I, working for Herbert Hoover and for the Commission for Relief in Belgium, heading up the child-feeding program in France and Belgium. She saw her work for the war effort as analogous to her work on household management: both were forms of national service. Papers relating to Kittredge's work with the Commission for Relief in the period 1915-18 are held by the Hoover Institution Archives in Stanford, California.\n\n"}

After the events of \"Metal Gear Solid\", he helped Solid Snake form Philanthropy, a group whose main objective is to prevent proliferation of Metal Gear-type weapons. Snake and Otacon infiltrate the military installations and facilities of the world, delving into their compounds through stealth and cyber hacking. In a sense, Snake is the brawn and Otacon is the brains behind \"Philanthropy.\"\n\nA devoted fan of anime, Hal's chosen nickname is the short form of the Otaku Convention, with reference to Otakon held in Washington, D.C. each year.

Strangelove vehemently opposed this, leading to an argument between Hal's parents and ultimately to his mother's death at his father's hands.

He became a big fan of anime, and started calling himself Otacon, short for the \"Otaku Convention\", which he never misses. He matriculated at MIT and earned his Ph.D. from Princeton University. During his college years, he was recruited by the FBI's Engineering Research Facility, but was fired from his job after hacking into their classified database. Otacon was hired by Armstech, Inc. to be the lead engineer for the Metal Gear REX project. He jumped at the chance to make an actual mecha type robot, which appears frequently in the anime he enjoys. He was led to believe that it was a mobile defense system, but in reality it was a nuclear doomsday weapon. \n\nIn 2005, during the Shadow Moses incident (the events of \"Metal Gear Solid\"), Otacon encountered Solid Snake, who had informed him of the true nature of Metal Gear REX. Devastated, Otacon realized that he had written yet another chapter in his family's dark history—his grandfather had worked on the Manhattan Project, and his father was born on the day of the Hiroshima bombing. Otacon had developed a strong attraction to FOXHOUND member Sniper Wolf. Distraught that Snake would have to kill her, Otacon eventually came to terms with her, himself, and his position in life. With Otacon's assistance, Snake was able to destroy Metal Gear REX and defeat the terrorist uprising. According to the in-universe novel \"In the Darkness of Shadow Moses: The Unofficial Truth\" in \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\", Otacon had allegedly left for Great Britain after the events of the terrorist uprising to visit relatives. After the schematics for Metal Gear were placed on the black market by Revolver Ocelot, Snake and Otacon formed Philanthropy, an organization dedicated to the end of the proliferation of Metal Gear-type weapons.\n\nIn 2007, prior to the events of \"\", Otacon received an email from his step sister, Emma, informing him of a new Metal Gear prototype codenamed RAY. The e-mail was actually a bait for the Patriots to lure Snake out of hiding and frame him for terrorism, by having Ocelot hijack RAY and place the blame on Snake with forged evidence. When the tanker was destroyed by Ocelot, Otacon took a boat and managed to save Snake, as well as Olga Gurlukovich. Otacon was forced to fake Snake's death after he was framed by the Patriots. Using connections he had with an organization, he managed to steal Liquid Snake's corpse (which was missing its right arm) and dumped it into the sea. He continued to manage Philanthropy's activities, while keeping Snake's survival a secret from the public.\n\nIn 2009, he received another anonymous e-mail, this time from Liquid (while taking over Ocelot's mind), informing him about the development of Arsenal Gear in the Big Shell. When Solidus seized the Big Shell, he infiltrated the facility with SEAL Team 10 to find Emma, who was among the hostages. He managed to be reunited with her, but she died shortly afterwards, due to stab wounds inflicted by Vamp. Before her death, Emma admitted to always admiring Hal and wanting to follow in his footsteps. Despite falling into deep despair, Snake encouraged him to move on and rescue all the hostages held in the Big Shell. Apparently he was successful in this, and stays in contact to support Raiden until he defeated Solidus. When Snake met Otacon at their hideout he was given the disk that contained the data of the Wisemen's Committee to look over, which included their names and whereabouts. After this (the ending note) Otacon told Solid Snake about the information on the disc: the twelve Wisemen had been dead for about 100 years.\n\nOtacon appeared once more as Snake's support man in \"\", set in 2014. He and Olga's daughter, Sunny, built a robotic companion to Snake called Metal Gear Mk. II, which he controlled remotely. The Mk. II was taken from a robotic character of the same name in \"Snatcher\". He became romantically involved with Naomi Hunter through the course of the story although he once again lost her upon her suicide, thus forcing him yet again to witness the death of a woman he cared about. In the finale, Otacon told Snake that he will live with Snake for the remainder of his life, to serve as witness of his existence. By the time of \"\" in 2018, Otacon is mentioned to have officially adopted Sunny.\n\nOutside of the \"Metal Gear\" series, Otacon made a guest appearance in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", where he was one of Snake's support crew available through taunting.\n\nOtacon is widely regarded as one of the best sidekick type characters in video games. As such, he was declared the best \"buddy in gaming\" by Machinima.com in 2010. Cracked.com included him on their 2010 list of six video game sidekicks that are actually more effective than the actual hero at number four, stating: \"Really, Otacon doesn't need Snake at all. The only thing keeping us from \"Metal Gear Solid: Nerdy Mouthbreather\" is the fact that Otacon pees all over himself when he's scared and has sex with his stepmother.\" In 2011, UGO Networks ranked him the sixth best video game companion, comparing him to Q of James Bond, while \"Maximum PC\" listed him among 25 of gaming's greatest sidekicks, commenting that \"Snake wouldn’t be half the man he is without Otacon backing him up.\" In 2013, Hanuman Welch of \"Complex\" ranked Otacon and Meryl Silverburgh \"ex equo\" at fourth place on a list of video game sidekicks that deserve their own titles. In GameSpot's poll \"All-Time Greatest Game Sidekick\", Otacon got to the semi-finals, before losing to Albert Einstein of the \"\" series. \n\nOtacon was ranked the fourth best \"Metal Gear\" character by \"Play\". 1UP.com's Scott Sharkey ranked Otacon's reaction to the death of Sniper Wolf at second place in his 2009 list of the series' \"most awkward\" moments, calling it \"the world's most embarrassingly stupid case of Stockholm syndrome.\" Among other reception, Marissa Meli of UGO placed him at third place on her 2010 list of the greatest Jewish characters in video games and Ryan Woo of \"Complex\" ranked him as the sixth most stylish video game character for his \"Metal Gear Solid 4\" outfit in 2011. In 2012, \"Complex\" also put him and Solid Snake at second place on their list of \"Most A**-Kicking Video Game Duos\", ScrewAttack ranked Otacon tenth on their top list of \"P#$$y @$$ B!tche$ in Gaming\", and GamesRadar included him among the \"13 unluckiest bastards in gaming\".\n"}

He was not the head of the weavers' guild as is popularly believed (mostly because he was portrayed as such in the novel \"The Lion of Flanders\" by Hendrik Conscience). Together with Jan Breydel, a butcher, he was in the forefront of the popular uprising that led to the Battle of the Golden Spurs. Right before that battle he was knighted together with two of his sons. \n\nBefore the Battle of the Golden Spurs began he was seen by the city government of Bruges as a dangerous agitator and was imprisoned in June 1301. He was freed by the people of Bruges. Afterwards, the \"Leliaarts\", a political faction supporting French rule, took over control of the city. Jacques de Châtillon, the then appointed governor of County of Flanders, entered Bruges with a small force and de Coninck was banished.\n\nUrged on by John I, Marquis of Namur, de Coninck restored his authority in Bruges in December 1301. He tried to align the people of Ghent on the same side but failed. On 1 May 1302 he was one of the leaders of a gang of rebels who took the castle of Sijsele and Male. At Male, the rebels killed the entire French garrison. De Châtillon responded by again marching on Bruges with a force of 800 men, and again expelling de Coninck from the city. De Châtillon marched into the city with his army fully clad and battle-ready (against established agreements with the city magistrates) The people of Bruges, fearing bloody preprisals, and in order to protect themselves helped de Coninck to enter the city with his followers during the night. On 18 May 1302, during the so-called Bruges Matins or \"Brugse Metten\", nearly all the French present in Bruges and their \"Leliaart\" supporters were killed. De Châtillon barely managed to escape.\n\nAfter the Bruges Matins, de Coninck was one of the leaders of the Bruges militia that cleared the coastal area from \"Leliaart\" insurgents and French stragglers. After they failed to take the besieged castle of Cassel, they marched onto Kortrijk (Courtrai) where a Flemish makeshift army was gathering to stop a French army under the command of Robert II of Artois. This battle, won by a motley alliance of Flemish and Namur petty nobles and many commoners, was later famously called the Battle of the Golden Spurs.\n\nIn 1309, together with Jan Breydel and Jan Heem, he led a new uprising in Bruges, this time against the adverse effects (for Flanders) of the peace of Athis-sur-Orge (1305). In 1321 he again took part in an uprising in Bruges. As a punishment all his possessions were confiscated and sold.\n\nPieter de Coninck was married twice. He died in 1332 or 1333. Together with Jan Breydel he has a statue on the market of Bruges. It was put up in 1887.\n"}

He studied Medicine at Aberdeen University graduating MB CM DPH in 1888.\n\nHe undertook his clinical training at Middlesex Hospital as house physician and surgeon. Aberdeen gave him his doctorate (MD) in 1894. In 1895 he became an Anatomy Demonstrator at the hospital and in 1896 became Senior Demonstrator.

{"id": "2444784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2444784", "title": "Richard Barlow (Intelligence analyst)", "text": "Richard Barlow (Intelligence analyst)\n\nRichard Barlow is an American intelligence analyst and a former senior member of the counter-proliferation desk at the Central Intelligence Agency who lost his job when he acted as a whistleblower about the George H. W. Bush administration's misleading Congress over Pakistan's nuclear weapon program. Following several investigations, he was vindicated in 1997; unable to collect a government pension, he lives in a motor home in Montana.\n\nBarlow entered the intelligence community with two years of work at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He then, in 1985, entered the CIA, where he collated and examined information about nuclear programs in the Third World. He worked on the National Intelligence Estimates, and won the CIA's Exceptional Accomplishment Award in 1988.\n\nIn 1989, Barlow transferred to the office of the Secretary of Defense, where he initiated an in-house intelligence analysis program. He was in a chain of command below Stephen J. Hadley, then Assistant Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of Defense was Dick Cheney. His early work included an effort to sound the alarm about the now-discredited Pakistani nuclear scientist and proliferator, Abdul Qadeer Khan. In particular, he discovered that Pakistan's nuclear program depended upon clandestine and illegal procurement activity within the United States. The US administration, however, knew that this was the case; indeed, his report detailed occasions when the State Department under Ronald Reagan had actually helped it happen, warning targets of sealed arrest warrants in FBI operations and approving export licenses for restricted goods.\n\nDuring the debate over the sale of F-16s to Pakistan in 1989, the U.S. administration was constrained by the 1985 Pressler amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act which prohibited the sale of any matériel or armaments which might assist in the development or delivery of nuclear weapons. Barlow's analysis of Pakistan's nuclear program indicated that Pakistan possessed the capability to use the fighters to drop nuclear bombs, and the report which he submitted to Dick Cheney concluded that the F-16 sale indisputably violated the law. He drew on details available to the intelligence community about how Pakistan had used the F-16s it already possessed.\n\nBarlow then learned that Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Hughes had delivered testimony to Congress that stated the exact opposite, including the statement that using F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons \"far exceeded the state of art in Pakistan,\" which Barlow knew to be untrue. Barlow believed that the details had been \"willfully falsified by officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense\", including then-Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz and then-Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Scooter Libby. On examining the archives he discovered that his reports were \"mysteriously substituted or altered\".\n\nWithin days of Barlow's sharing his concerns with colleagues at the Department of Defense, he was fired.\n\nBarlow brought a legal action for wrongful dismissal that received considerable attention, including from the United States Congress, where he was defended by Paul Wolfowitz, who said \"there have been times on that issue when I specifically sensed that people thought we could somehow construct a policy on a house of cards that the Congress wouldn't know what the Pakistanis were doing\" and that the retaliation Barlow had faced was \"wrong\".\n\nFollowing congressionally ordered investigations, the inspector-general at the State Department concluded that Barlow had been fired as a reprisal; however, the inspector-generals at the CIA and the Defense Department stated that the Pentagon was within its rights to fire Barlow. A final investigation by Congress' own Government Accountability Office was completed in 1997 and \"largely vindicated\" Barlow, who had his security clearance restored. During the investigation, the State department inspector-general, Sherman Funk, described Barlow as \"one of the most brilliant analysts I've ever seen\".\n\nThe activities of the Defense Department officials, however, including Cheney, Libby, Wolfowitz and Hadley, were never investigated. Rep. Stephen Solarz, a major player in counter-proliferation, told Seymour Hersh for the latter's famous exposé of the Pakistani nuclear program that \"If what Barlow says is true, this would have been a major scandal of Iran-Contra proportions, and the officials involved would have had to resign\".\n\nBarlow, however, was unable to find employment after his clearance was removed and marriage broke up. \"They viciously tried to destroy my life, personally and professionally\" he is quoted as saying. \"Not just my career, but they went after my marriage, my livelihood, and smeared my name in truly extraordinary ways that no one had ever seen before or since—at least not until the Wilsons were victims of the same people years later.\" According to Barlow the allegations included the \"fabrication\" that he \"was an 'intended' Congressional spy\", that he was an alcoholic, had not paid his taxes, and was an adulterer. \"Then they accused me of being psychotic and used that to invade my marital privacy, including that of my now ex-wife who also worked at the CIA, and sought to destroy my marriage as punishment.\"\n\nAlthough he was found to have breached no national security regulations and was vindicated, Barlow did not receive his government pension and has had trouble finding employment. The authors of \"The Nuclear Jihadist\" a biography of A.Q. Khan, caused a sensation in 2005 when they revealed that they had tracked him down to a motor home in Bozeman, Montana where he lived with two dogs.\n"}
{"id": "1723963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1723963", "title": "Roger Stone", "text": "Roger Stone\n\nRoger Jason Stone Jr. (born August 27, 1952) is an American political consultant, lobbyist and strategist noted for his use of opposition research, usually for candidates of the Republican Party. Since the 1970s, Stone has worked on the campaigns of key Republican politicians such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, Bob Dole and Donald Trump.\n\nIn addition to serving as a frequent campaign advisor, Stone was previously a political lobbyist. In 1980, he co-founded the Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone with principals Paul Manafort and Charles R. Black Jr. The firm recruited Peter G. Kelly and was renamed Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly in 1984. During the 1980s, BMSK became a top lobbying firm by leveraging its White House connections to attract high-paying clients including U.S. corporations, trade associations, and foreign governments. By 1990, it was one of the leading lobbyists for American companies and foreign organizations.\n\nStone has variously been referred to in media as a \"political dirty trickster\", a \"renowned infighter\", a \"seasoned practitioner of hard-edged politics\", a \"mendacious windbag\", and a \"veteran Republican strategist\". Over the course of the Trump presidential campaign, Stone promoted a number of falsehoods and conspiracy theories.\n\nStone is the subject of a Netflix documentary film, titled \"Get Me Roger Stone\", which focuses on his past and on his role in the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Stone first suggested Trump run for President in the spring of 1998 while Stone was Trump's casino business lobbyist in Washington.\n\nStone officially left the Trump campaign on August 8, 2015; however, it has been reported that, as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States election, two associates of Stone have claimed he collaborated with WikiLeaks owner Julian Assange in the spring of 2016 to discredit Hillary Clinton's campaign. Stone has denied this.\n\nStone was born on August 27, 1952, in Norwalk, Connecticut, to Gloria Rose (Corbo) and Roger J. Stone. He grew up in Lewisboro, New York, in a family of Hungarian and Italian descent. His mother was a small-town reporter, his father a well driller and business owner. He has described his family as middle-class, blue-collar Catholics.\n\nIn the first grade, Stone claims, he broke into politics to further John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign: \"I remember going through the cafeteria line and telling every kid that Nixon was in favor of school on Saturdays ... It was my first political trick.\"\n\nWhen he was a junior and vice president of student government at his high school in northern Westchester County, New York, he manipulated the ouster of the president and succeeded him. Stone recalled how he ran for election as president for his senior year:\nI built alliances and put all my serious challengers on my ticket. Then I recruited the most unpopular guy in the school to run against me. You think that's mean? No, it's smart.\n\nGiven a copy of Barry Goldwater's \"The Conscience of a Conservative\", Stone became a convert to conservatism as a child and a volunteer in Goldwater's 1964 campaign. In 2007, Stone indicated he was a staunch conservative but with libertarian leanings.\n\nAs a student at George Washington University in 1972, Stone invited Jeb Magruder to speak at a Young Republicans Club meeting, then asked Magruder for a job with Richard Nixon's Committee to Re-elect the President. Magruder agreed and Stone then left college to work for the committee.\n\nStone's political career began in earnest on the 1972 Nixon campaign, with activities such as contributing money to a possible rival of Nixon in the name of the Young Socialist Alliance – then slipping the receipt to the \"Manchester Union-Leader\". He also hired a spy in the Hubert Humphrey campaign who became Humphrey's driver. According to Stone, during the day he was officially a scheduler in the Nixon campaign, but \"By night, I'm trafficking in the black arts. Nixon's people were obsessed with intelligence.\" Stone maintains he never did anything illegal during Watergate.\n\nAfter Nixon won the 1972 presidential election, Stone worked for the administration in the Office of Economic Opportunity. After Nixon resigned, Stone went to work for Bob Dole, but was later fired after columnist Jack Anderson publicly identified Stone as a Nixon 'dirty trickster'.\n\nIn 1975, Stone helped found the National Conservative Political Action Committee, a New Right organization that helped to pioneer independent expenditure political advertising.\n\nIn 1976, he worked in Ronald Reagan's campaign for president. In 1977, at age 24, Stone won the presidency of the Young Republicans in a campaign managed by his friend Paul Manafort; they had compiled a dossier for each of the 800 delegates that gathered, which they called “whip books”.\n\nStone went on to serve as chief strategist for Thomas Kean's campaign for governor of New Jersey in 1981 and for his re-election campaign in 1985.\n\nStone, the \"keeper of the Nixon flame\", was an adviser to the former president in his post-presidential years, serving as \"Nixon's man in Washington\". Stone was a protégé of former Connecticut Governor John Davis Lodge, who introduced the young Stone to then former Vice President Nixon in 1967.\n\nJohn Sears recruited Stone to work in Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, coordinating the Northeast. Stone said that Roy Cohn helped him arrange for John B. Anderson to get the nomination of the Liberal Party of New York, a move that would help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and that, as instructed by Cohn, he dropped off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46% of the vote. Speaking after the statute of limitations for bribery had expired, Stone later said, \"I paid his law firm. Legal fees. I don't know what he did for the money, but whatever it was, the Liberal party reached its right conclusion out of a matter of principle.\"\n\nIn 1980, after their key roles in the Reagan campaign, Stone and Manafort decided to go into business together, with partner Charlie Black, creating a political consulting and lobbying firm to cash in on their relationships within the new administration. Black, Manafort & Stone (BMS), became one of Washington D.C.’s first mega-lobbying firms and was described as instrumental to the success of Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign. Republican political strategist Lee Atwater joined the firm in 1985, after serving in the #2 position on Reagan-Bush 1984.\n\nBecause of BMS’s willingness to represent brutal third-world dictators like Mobutu Sese Seko in the Republic of the Congo and Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, the firm was branded \"The Torturers’ Lobby\". BMS also represented a host of high-powered corporate clients, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, The Tobacco Institute and, starting in the early 1980s, Donald Trump.\n\nIn 1987–88, Stone served as senior adviser to Jack Kemp's presidential campaign, which was managed by consulting partner Charlie Black. In that same election, his other partners worked for George H. W. Bush (Lee Atwater as campaign manager, and Paul Manafort as director of operations in the fall campaign).\n\nIn April 1992, \"Time\" alleged that Stone was involved with the controversial Willie Horton advertisements to aid George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, which were targeted against Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis. Stone has said that he urged Lee Atwater not to include Horton in the ad. Stone denied making or distributing the advertisement, and said it was Atwater's doing. However, the actual ads featuring Horton's picture (run originally on CNN) were produced by Americans for Bush/NSPAC (National Security PAC), an independent-expenditure group not controlled or coordinated by Atwater and the Bush campaign. FEC records for NSPAC do not indicate any payments to or affiliation with Stone, and the ads were reported in 1988 and thereafter to have been produced by another consultant.\n\nIn the 1990s, Stone and Manafort sold their business. Although their careers went in different directions, their relationship remained close.\n\nStone married his first wife Anne Elizabeth Wesche in 1974. Using the name Ann E.W. Stone, she and Stone founded the group Republicans for Choice in 1989. They divorced in 1990.\n\nIn 1995, Stone was the president of Republican Senator Arlen Specter's campaign for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. Specter withdrew early in the campaign season with less than 2% support.\n\nStone was for many years a lobbyist for Donald Trump on behalf of his casino business and also was involved in opposing expanded casino gambling in New York State, a position that brought him into conflict with Governor George Pataki.\n\nIn 1996, Stone resigned from a post as a consultant on Senator Bob Dole's campaign for president after \"The National Enquirer\" wrote that Stone had placed ads and pictures in racy swingers' publications and a website seeking sexual partners for himself and his second wife, Nydia Bertran Stone, whom he married in Las Vegas in 1992. Stone initially denied the report. On the \"Good Morning America\" program he stated, \"An exhaustive investigation now indicates that a domestic employee who I discharged for substance abuse on the second time that we learned that he had a drug problem is the perpetrator who had access to my home, access to my computer, access to my password, access to my postage meter, access to my post-office box key.\" In a 2008 interview with \"The New Yorker\" Stone admitted that the ads were authentic.\n\nIn 2000, Stone served as campaign manager of Donald Trump's aborted campaign for president in the Reform Party primary. Investigative journalist Wayne Barrett accused Stone of persuading Trump to publicly consider a run for the Reform nomination to sideline Pat Buchanan and sabotage the Reform Party in an attempt to lower their vote total to benefit George W. Bush.\n\nLater that year, according to Stone and the film \"Recount\", Stone was recruited by James Baker to assist with public relations during the Florida recount. His role in the Brooks Brothers riot, the demonstration by Republican operatives against the recount, remains controversial.\n\nIn 2002, Stone was associated with the campaign of businessman Thomas Golisano for governor of New York State.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential campaign, Democrat Al Sharpton responded to accusations that Stone was working on his campaign, stating, \"I've been talking to Roger Stone for a long time. That doesn't mean that he's calling the shots for me. Don't forget that Bill Clinton was doing more than talking to Dick Morris.\" Critics suggested that Stone was only working with Sharpton as a way to undermine the Democratic Party's chances of winning the election. Sharpton denies that Stone had any influence over his campaign.\n\nIn that election a blogger accused Stone of responsibility for the Kerry–Specter campaign materials which were circulated in Pennsylvania. Such signs were considered controversial because they were seen as an effort to get Democrats who supported Kerry to vote for then Republican Senator Arlen Specter in heavily Democratic Philadelphia.\n\nDuring the 2004 general election, Stone was accused by then-DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe of forging the Killian memos that led CBS News to report that President Bush had not fulfilled his service obligations while enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard. McAuliffe cited a report in the \"New York Post\" in his accusations. For his part, Stone denied having forged the documents.\n\nIn 2007, Stone, a top adviser at the time to Joseph Bruno (the Majority Leader of the New York State Senate), was forced to resign by Bruno after allegations that Stone had threatened Bernard Spitzer, the then-83-year-old father of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Eliot Spitzer. On August 6, 2007, an expletive-laced message was left on the elder Spitzer's answering machine threatening to prosecute the elderly man if he did not implicate his son in wrongdoing. Bernard Spitzer hired a private detective agency that traced the call to the phone of Roger Stone's wife. Roger Stone denied leaving the message, despite the fact that his voice was recognized, claiming he was at a movie that was later shown not to have been screened that night. Stone was accused on an episode of \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" on August 22, 2007 of being the voice on an expletive-laden voicemail threatening Bernard Spitzer, father of Eliot, with subpoenas. Donald Trump is quoted as saying of the incident, \"They caught Roger red-handed, lying. What he did was ridiculous and stupid.\"\n\nStone consistently denied the reports. Thereafter, however, he resigned from his position as a consultant to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee at Bruno's request.\n\nIn January 2008, Stone founded Citizens United Not Timid, an anti-Hillary Clinton 527 group with an intentionally obscene acronym.\n\nStone is featured in \"\", documentary on Lee Atwater made in 2008. He also was featured in \"\", the 2010 documentary of the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal.\n\nFormer Trump aide Sam Nunberg considers Stone his mentor during this time, and \"surrogate father\".\n\nIn February 2010, Stone became campaign manager for Kristin Davis, a madam linked with the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal, in her bid for the Libertarian Party nomination for governor of New York in the 2010 election. Stone said that the campaign \"is not a hoax, a prank or a publicity stunt. I want to get her a half-million votes.\" However, he later was spotted at a campaign rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino, of whom Stone has spoken favorably. Stone admittedly had been providing support and advice to both campaigns on the grounds that the two campaigns had different goals: Davis was seeking to gain permanent ballot access for her party, and Paladino was in the race to win (and was Stone's preferred candidate). As such, Stone did not believe he had a conflict of interest in supporting both candidates. While working for the Davis campaign, Warren Redlich, the Libertarian nominee for Governor, alleged that Stone collaborated with a group entitled \"People for a Safer New York\" to send a flyer labeling Redlich a \"sexual predator\" and \"sick, twisted pervert\" based on a blog post Redlich had made in 2008. Redlich later sued Stone in a New York court for defamation over the flyers, and sought $20,000,000 in damages. However, the jury in the case returned a verdict in favor of Stone in December 2017, finding that Redlich failed to prove Stone was involved with the flyers.\n\nStone volunteered as an unpaid advisor to comedian Steve Berke (\"a libertarian member of his so-called After Party\") in his 2011 campaign for mayor of Miami Beach, Florida in 2012. (Berke lost the race to incumbent mayor Matti Herrera Bower.)\n\nIn February 2012, Stone said that he had changed his party affiliation from the Republican Party to the Libertarian Party. Stone predicted a \"Libertarian moment\" in 2016 and the end of the Republican party.\n\nIn June 2012, Stone said that he was running a super PAC in support of former New Mexico governor and Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, whom he had met at a \"Reason\" magazine Christmas party two years earlier. Stone told the \"Huffington Post\" that Johnson had a real role to play, although \"I have no allusions (sic) of him winning.\"\n\nStone considered running as a Libertarian candidate for governor of Florida in 2014, but in May 2013 said in a statement that he would not run, and that he wanted to devote himself to campaigning in support of a 2014 constitutional amendment on the Florida ballot to legalize medical marijuana.\n\nStone served as an advisor to the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Stone left the campaign on August 8, 2015 amid controversy, with Stone claiming he quit and Trump claiming that Stone was fired. Despite this, Stone still supported Trump. A few days later, Stone wrote an op-ed called \"The man who just resigned from Donald Trump's campaign explains how Trump can still win\" for \"Business Insider\".\n\nDespite calling Stone a \"stone-cold loser\" in a 2008 interview and accusing him of seeking too much publicity in a statement shortly after Stone left the campaign, Donald Trump praised him during an appearance in December 2015 on Alex Jones' radio show that was orchestrated by Stone. \"Roger's a good guy,\" Trump said. \"He's been so loyal and so wonderful.\" Stone remained an informal advisor to and media surrogate for Trump throughout the campaign.\n\nDuring the course of the 2016 campaign, Stone was banned from appearing on CNN and MSNBC after making a series of offensive Twitter posts disparaging television personalities. Stone specifically referred to a CNN commentator as an \"entitled diva bitch\" and imagined her \"killing herself\", and called another CNN personality a \"stupid negro\" and a \"fat negro\". Erik Wemple, media writer for \"The Washington Post\", described Stone's tweets as \"nasty\" and \"bigoted\". In February 2016, CNN said that it would no longer invite Stone to appear on its network, and MSNBC followed suit, confirming in April 2016 that Stone had also been banned from that network. In a June 2016 appearance on \"On Point\", Stone told Tom Ashbrook: \"I would have to admit that calling Roland Martin a 'fat negro' was a two-martini tweet, and I regret that. As for my criticism of Ana Navarro not being qualified ... I don't understand why she's there, given her lack of qualifications.\"\n\nIn March 2016, an article in the tabloid magazine \"National Enquirer\" stated that Ted Cruz, Trump's Republican primary rival, had extramarital affairs with five women. The article quoted Stone as saying, \"These stories have been swirling about Cruz for some time. I believe where there is smoke there is fire.\" Cruz denied the allegations (calling it \"garbage\" and a \"tabloid smear\") and accused the Trump campaign, and Stone specifically, of planting the story as part of an orchestrated smear campaign against him. Cruz stated, \"It is a story that quoted one source on the record, Roger Stone, Donald Trump's chief political adviser. And I would note that Mr. Stone is a man who has 50 years of dirty tricks behind him. He's a man for whom a term was coined for copulating with a rodent.\" In April 2016, Cruz again criticized Stone, saying on Sean Hannity's radio show of Stone: \"He is pulling the strings on Donald Trump. He planned the Trump campaign, and he is Trump's henchman and dirty trickster. And this pattern, Donald keeps associating himself with people who encourage violence.\" Stone responded by comparing Cruz to Richard Nixon and accusing him of being a liar.\n\nIn April 2016, Stone formed a pro-Trump activist group, Stop the Steal, and threatened \"Days of Rage\" if Republican party leaders tried to deny the nomination to Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The \"Washington Post\" reported that Stone \"is organizing [Trump] supporters as a force of intimidation\", noting that Stone \"has ... threatened to publicly disclose the hotel room numbers of delegates who work against Trump\". Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said that Stone's threat to publicize the hotel room numbers of delegates was \"just totally over the line\".\n\nAfter Trump had been criticized at the Democratic National Convention for his comments on Muslims by Khizr Khan, a Pakistani American whose son received a posthumous Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004, Stone made headlines defending Trump's criticism by accusing Khan of sympathizing with the enemy.\n\nDuring the campaign, Stone frequently promoted conspiracy theories, including the false claim that Clinton aide Huma Abedin was connected to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn early 2018, the Portland, Oregon newspaper Willamette Week published an article describing his relationship with the Proud Boys.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Stone was accused by Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta of having prior knowledge of the publishing by WikiLeaks of Podesta's private emails obtained by a hacker. Stone tweeted before the leak, \"It will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel\". Five days before the leak, Stone tweeted, \"Wednesday Hillary Clinton is done. #Wikileaks.\" Stone has denied having any advance knowledge of the Podesta email hack or any connection to Russian intelligence, stating that his earlier tweet was referring to reports of the Podesta Group's own ties to Russia. In his opening statement before the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on September 26, 2017, Stone reiterated this claim: \"Note that my tweet of August 21, 2016, makes no mention, whatsoever, of Mr. Podesta's email, but does accurately predict that the Podesta brothers' business activities in Russia ... would come under public scrutiny.\"\n\nHowever, Stone has repeatedly acknowledged that he had established a back-channel with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to obtain information on Hillary Clinton. Stone has pointed to this intermediary as the source for his advance knowledge about the release of Podesta's e-mails by WikiLeaks. Stone ultimately named Randy Credico, who had interviewed both Assange and Stone for a radio show, as his intermediary with Assange.\n\nIn February 2017, \"The New York Times\" reported that as part of its ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign, the FBI was looking into any contacts Stone may have had with Russian operatives.\n\nIn March 2017, after reports surfaced in \"The Washington Times\" that Stone had direct-messaged alleged DNC hacker Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter, Stone admitted to having contact with the mysterious persona and made public excerpts of the messages. Stone claimed the messages were just innocent praise of the hacking. According to a publicly released report by U.S. intelligence agencies, the U.S. intelligence community believes Guccifer 2.0 to be a false persona created by Russian intelligence to obscure its role in the DNC hack. The Guccifer 2.0 persona has since been linked with an IP address believed to originate at the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, in Moscow; apparently this was discovered by the FBI when a user with a Moscow IP address logged into one of the Guccifer social media accounts without using a VPN.\n\nIn March 2017, the Senate Intelligence Committee asked Stone to preserve all documents related to any Russian contacts. The Committee Vice Chair, Senator Mark Warner, called on Stone to testify before the committee, saying he \"hit the trifecta\" of shady dealings with Russia. Stone denied any wrongdoing in an interview on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" on March 31, 2017, and claimed he was willing to testify before the committee.\n\nOn September 26, 2017, Stone testified before the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors, but he released a public statement which he had delivered to the Committee shortly before, and supplied to the media afterwards. The Washington Post noted his affiliations with Infowars, Breitbart, and Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories promulgator, Jerome Corsi. Stone also made personal attacks on Democratic committee members Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell and Dennis Heck.\n\nOn October 28, 2017, Stone became agitated following a news report by CNN that indictments would be announced within a few days. Subsequently, Stone's Twitter account was suspended by Twitter for what it called \"targeted abuse\" of various CNN personnel in a series of derogatory, threatening and obscenity-filled tweets.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, two sources close to Stone, former Trump aide Sam Nunberg and a person speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged to the Washington Post that Stone had established contact with WikiLeaks owner Julian Assange and that the two had a telephone conversation discussing emails related to the Clinton campaign which had been leaked to WikiLeaks. According to Nunberg, who claimed he spoke to the paper after being asked to do so by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Stone joked to him that he had taken a trip to London to personally meet with Assange, but declined to do so, had only wanted to have telephone conversations to remain undetected and did not have advance notice of the leaked emails. The other source, who spoke on anonymity, stated that the conversation occurred before it was publicly known that hackers had obtained the emails of Podesta and of the Democratic National Committee, documents that WikiLeaks released in late July and October. Stone afterwards denied that he had contacted Assange or had known in advance about the leaked emails.\n\nIn May 2018, Stone's social media consultant, Jason Sullivan, was issued grand jury subpoenas from the Mueller investigation.\n\nOn July 3, 2018, U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle dismissed a lawsuit brought by political activist group Protect Democracy, alleging that Donald Trump's campaign and Stone conspired with Russia and WikiLeaks to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 presidential election race. The judge found that the suit was brought in the wrong jurisdiction. Six days later, in July 13, the anonymous person mentioned in the indictment released by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which charged twelve Russian military intelligence officials with conspiring to interfere in the 2016 elections, as somebody the Russian hackers operating by means of the online persona Guccifer 2.0 communicated with, and who the indictment alleged ″was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign″ was identified by two government officials as Stone.\n\nSince 2010, Stone has been an occasional contributor to the conservative website \"The Daily Caller\", serving as a \"male fashion editor\". Stone also writes for his own fashion blog, \"Stone on Style\".\n\nStone has written five books, all published by Skyhorse Publishing of New York City. Stone's books have been described as \"hatchet jobs\" by the \"Miami Herald\" and \"Tampa Bay Times\".\n\nStone has been noted for his personal style, described as flamboyant. In a 2007 \"Weekly Standard\" profile written by Matt Labash, Stone was described as a \"lord of mischief\" and the \"boastful black prince of Republican sleaze.\" Labash wrote that Stone \"often sets his pronouncements off with the utterance 'Stone's Rules,' signifying to listeners that one of his shot-glass commandments is coming down, a pithy dictate uttered with the unbending certitude one usually associates with the Book of Deuteronomy.\" Examples of Stone's Rules include \"Politics with me isn't theater. It's performance art, sometimes for its own sake.\"\n\nStone does not wear socks—a fact that Nancy Reagan brought to her husband's attention during his 1980 presidential campaign. Labash described him as \"a dandy by disposition who boasts of having not bought off-the-rack since he was 17,\" who has \"taught reporters how to achieve perfect double-dimples underneath their tie knots.\" Washington journalist Victor Gold has noted Stone's reputation as one of the \"smartest dressers\" in Washington. Stone's longtime tailor is Alan Flusser. Stone dislikes single-vent jackets (describing them as the sign of a \"heathen\"); says he owns 100 silver-colored neckties; and has 100 suits in storage. Fashion stories have been written about him in \"GQ\" and \"Penthouse\". Stone has written of his dislike for jeans and ascots and has praised seersucker three-piece suits, as well as Madras jackets in the summertime and velvet blazers in the winter.\n\nIn 1999, Stone credited his preternatural looks to \"decades of following a regimen of Chinese herbs, breathing therapies, tai chi and acupuncture,\" according to the \"Times\". Stone wears a diamond pinkie ring in the shape of a horseshoe and in 2007 he had Richard Nixon's face tattooed on his back. As of 2007, he owned five Jaguar cars and five Yorkshire Terriers. In 2016, he claimed in a \"Newsweek\" interview that at least two of his dogs have been poisoned. He has said: \"I like English tailoring, I like Italian shoes. I like French wine. I like vodka martinis with an olive, please. I like to keep physically fit.\"\n\nStone's office in Florida has been described as a \"Hall of Nixonia\" with framed pictures, posters, and letters associated with Nixon. Exceptions are a poster of a stripper and a photo of him standing by a pool with a bikini-clad pornographic film actress, Nina Hartley.\n\n"}

{"id": "14647718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14647718", "title": "Serbian names", "text": "Serbian names\n\nThis article features the naming culture of personal names of ethnic Serbs and the Serbian language. Serbian names are rendered in the \"Western name order\" with the surname placed after the given name. \"Eastern name order\" may be used when multiple names appear in a sorted list, particularly in official notes and legal documents when the last name is capitalized (e.g. MILOVANOVIĆ Janko).\n\nAs with most European cultures, a child is given a first name chosen by their parents or is chosen by godparents. The given name comes first, the surname last, e.g. \"Željko Popović\", where \"Željko\" is a first name and \"Popović\" is a family name.\n\nSerbian first names largely originate from Slavic roots: e.g. Slobodan, Miroslav, Vladimir, Zoran, Ljubomir, Vesna, Radmila, Dragan, Milan, Goran, Radomir, Vukašin, Miomir, Branimir, Budimir; see also Slavic names, or the )\n\nSome may be non-Slavic but chosen to reflect Christian faith. Names of this nature may often originate from Hebrew for Biblical reasons. Christian names include: e.g. Nikola, Ivan, Jovan, Marija, Ana, Mihailo. Along similar lines of non-Slavic names among Christians, the origins for many such names are Greek: e.g. Aleksandar, Andrej, Teodora, Jelena, Sofija, Katarina, Nikola, Đorđe, Stefan, Petar, Vasilije, Todor. Names of Latin origin include: e.g. Marko, Anđelka, Antonije, Pavle, Srđan, Marina, Natalija, Kornelije. Names of Germanic origin, entering through Russian, include: e.g. Igor, Oliver, Olga.\n\nIn Serbian naming culture, apotropaic names (\"zaštitne ime\", \"protective names\") include Vuk (and its many derivatives), Nenad, Prodan, Sredoje, Staniša, and others.\n\nMost Serbian surnames have the surname suffix \"-ić\" (-ић) (). This can sometimes further be transcribed as \"-ic\", but in history, Serbian names have often been transcribed with a phonetic ending, -ich or -itch.\n\nThis form is often associated with Serbs from before the early 20th century: hence Milutin Milanković is usually referred to, for historical reasons, as Milutin Milankovitch, and Mileva Marić, born in Vojvodina (then a part of Hungary) has sometimes been rendered as Marity (e.g. in the claim of \"Einstein-Marity\" theory).\n\nThe -ić suffix is a Slavic diminutive, originally functioning to create patronymics. Thus the surname Petrović means the little son of Petar (Petrić signifies the little son of Petra, the widow).\n\nMost Serbian surnames are paternal (father), maternal (mother), occupational, or derived from personal traits.\n\nOther common surname suffixes are \"-ov\", \"-ev\", \"-in\" and \"-ski\" (also -cki/čki/ški) which is the Slavic possessive case suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov. The two suffixes are often combined, most commonly as -ović. Other, less common suffices are \"-alj/olj/elj\", \"-ija\", \"-ica\", \"-ar/ac/an\", .\n\nWhen marrying, the woman most often adopts her husband's family name, though she can also keep both of her last names or not change her last name at all.\n\nIt is estimated that some two thirds of all Serbian surnames end in -ić. The ten most common surnames in Serbia, in order, are Jovanović, Petrović, Nikolić, Marković, Đorđević, Stojanović, Ilić, Stanković, Pavlović and Milošević.\n\nOutside Serbian countries, Slavic suffixes have been transliterated. Serbs in Hungary have the endings -ity -ics -its, Serbs in R. Macedonia -ikj (iḱ, иќ), and Serbs in Romania -ici.\n\nThe names of Serbian rulers thru Mutimir are Slavic dithematic names, as per Old Slavic tradition, until the 9th century and Christianization after which Christian names appear.\n\nDemetrios Chomatenos (Archbishop of Ohrid from 1216 to 1236) registered the naming culture of the South Slavs in Byzantine lands. In the 11th and 12th century, family names became more common and stable in Byzantium, adapted by the majority of people in Byzantine Macedonia, Epirus and other regions (including women, sometimes even monks), not only aristocrats. The South Slavs, however, maintained the tradition of only giving a personal name, sometimes with a Patronymic. There are only 2 cases of family names used by South Slavs during this time; Bogdanopoulos and Serbopoulos, both Serbian names with the Greek suffix -opoulos (όπουλος, originating in Peloponnese in the 10th century)\n\nIn older naming convention which was common in Serbia up until the mid 19th century a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from father's personal name, and the family name, as seen in for example in the name of language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, and is a nationally-recognized commentator on Native American issues, politics, and ethics. In 1994, Rodgers founded Carlyle Consulting, a governmental/media/public relations firm located in Alexandria, Virginia that represents the interests of Native Americans.\n\nRodgers played an important role in the investigation that led to the conviction of former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Since then, Rodgers has waged a Native American Voting Rights effort to help provide Native Americans on remote, poverty-stricken reservations with equal access to voting. Rodgers has dubbed the effort to suppress the Native American vote \"the Jim Crow of the West.\" He played a lead role in an historic Native American voter registration and turnout effort in the 2016 elections. The effort drew the support of Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and National Congress of American Indians, prevailing in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorney General Eric Holder in June 2014 stated that the Montana native voting rights \"conditions are unacceptable and they are outrageous...As a nation, we cannot -- and we will not -- simply stand by as the voices of Native Americans are shut out of the democratic process.\"\n\nIn May 2015, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, a stalwart proponent of expanding voter access for Native Americans, transmitted to Vice President Joe Biden and Speaker of the House John Boehner a request in statutory form that the outcome sought in the Wandering Medicine litigation should be enacted into federal law. This was soon followed by introduction of legislation by Senators Jon Tester, Heidi Heitkamp, Tom Udall, and Al Franken. The federal action elevated the significance of the Wandering Medicine litigation in the Native Americans empowerment and enfranchisement movement dating back to the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. In the spring of 2018, Tester broadened the Native American voter access fight, demanding Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director Tracy Toulou of the Office of Tribal Justice establish satellite voting locations on tribal lands. \n\nBuilding off the voter project, in the fall of 2016 Rodgers joined a national advocacy effort on behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux, working to educate lawmakers and officials in Washington, D.C. and nationwide to the need to protect the water supply for the tribe and all downstream residents in the upper Missouri River region from the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\nRodgers is currently engaged in an effort to repatriate to his native land the remains and spirit of Jim Thorpe, one of the greatest athletes in history known in his Sac and Fox Nation as Wa-tho-huck (the \"light after the lightning”). In what Rodgers describes as a \"sacred covenant\" with Bill Thorpe, the son of Wa-tho-huck, Rodgers is working to have Wa-tho-huck's remains moved from a tomb in Pennsylvania to Oklahoma, so his spirit can rest in peace in his ancestral home.\n\nRodgers is also leading an ongoing effort to educate people about the impact the opioid crisis has had on Native American tribes and nations. Rodgers is organizing Native Americans as part of a federal class action lawsuit against opioid manufacturers and distributors. Legal action taken by his own Blackfeet Nation was named in July 2018 as one of two Native American bellwether cases in the opioid class action lawsuit.\n\nRodgers was born and raised on the Great Plains near Glasgow, Montana, considered to be the most isolated community in the U.S. and located in \"the middle of nowhere.\" Rodgers obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Economics, J.D. and L.L.M in Taxation at the University of Denver. He went on to obtain a Masters in International Public Policy with an emphasis in China Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He also attended the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business Executive MBA program. Rodgers commitment to education includes regularly speaking before high school and college students.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1993, Rodgers served as tax legislative counsel to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus. Before that, he served as tax counsel to United States Tax Court Judge Marvin F. Peterson. Rodgers went on to form Carlyle Consulting. He has written about persistent poverty and high unemployment in Native American communities.\nRodgers established a scholarship at his alma mater, The University of Denver Sturm College of Law, named the Tom C. Rodgers O-tee-paym-soo-wuk Ethics in Government Scholarship, to benefit Native American law students, “O-tee-paym-soo-wuk” means “a man who owns himself” in the Cree language. The purpose of the scholarship is to develop the legal and advocacy skills necessary to participate in the debate surrounding public policy and its creation, using ethics as their guiding value. The total scholarship value is around $160,000 over three years. Rodgers has raised more than $1.2 million in charity for Native American youth, tribal governments, Native American financial literacy programs, and Native American voting rights efforts.\n\nAfter years of advocating for \"Indian Country\", Rodgers was approached in early 2002 by tribal leaders from The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana and The Saginaw Chippewa of Michigan to discuss threats that had been made to them by their lobbyist Jack Abramoff. They expressed concern as to the services they were receiving in exchange for the large amount being charged.\nRodgers worked with the tribal members to gather internal invoices and documents, and leak the documents to reporters. They were instrumental in exposing Abramoff's criminal activities, which subsequently led to the arrest of former Rep. Bob Ney (R-Ohio), helping to force then-Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) from office. During this time, Rodgers was represented by whistle-blowers' advocate, Houston attorney Philip H. Hilder. In the aftermath, Congress passed the most sweeping new ethics rules since Watergate.\n\nRodgers has continued to track Abramoff to criticize his reform claims, to question the intentions of organizations that have shown support for Abramoff’s recent reform efforts. and the extent to which Abramoff’s influence reached into the media. Rodgers appeared in the documentary, ‘’Casino Jack and the United States of Money’’, by Alex Gibney about the career and corruption scandal surrounding Jack Abramoff. He received an ethics award from the University of Denver for his role in bringing to light Abramoff’s criminal actions.\n\nRodgers has been interviewed on the Abramoff case, as well as on Native American rights, for media outlets, including \"The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, USA Today, The Hill, The Huffington Post,\" BBC, \"The Nation,\" CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, \"The Atlantic, Roll Call, Financial Times, Bloomberg News, Talking Points Memo, Washingtonian, Indian Country Today,\" Democracy NOW, and the National Press Club newsmakers series. \n"}

His father, a master tailor measured , while his siblings and mother Anne were of average size, although one sister who died in an accident at age 16 was tall.\n\nHe was said to have been teased at school because of his height, though many students were scared of him. Teachers at the school were said to have punished misbehaving students by getting Bradley to lift them onto high cross beams, until the teacher decided to have them taken down again. After leaving school he worked on a farm near the town of Pocklington, earning less than 10 shillings (50p) a week.\n\nBradley travelled with a group of showmen under the alias of the Yorkshire Giant; at the time, the freak shows were popular and would draw large crowds. As the tallest British man, Bradley was a prized asset in the business joining the huge Yorkshire Pig which was bred in Sancton two miles from Market Weighton.\n\nAfter touring many fairs up and down the country, including the Hull Fair, he parted from his minder by 1815 to manage himself. He would charge a shilling for each person to visit him in a room which he hired in various towns. He was even presented before King George III at Windsor who gave him a large golden watch on a chain, which he wore for the rest of his life.\n\nBradley died aged 33 in his hometown of Market Weighton, where he was buried inside the church because of fears of graverobbing. His house still stands on Market Hill. The A1079 road which passes Market Weighton is named Giant Bradley Way.\n\nAn annual festival is organised in memory of William Bradley in his home town of Market Weighton. The event has been held annually in May since 1996 and is attended by hundreds of people in the town. It is a family-oriented event with games, amusement rides, stalls and other attractions, including the famous \"Weighton Lash\". Christopher Greener who was the tallest living European for a period of time has taken part in the celebrations in the past.\n"}
{"id": "99338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99338", "title": "William Henry Perkin", "text": "William Henry Perkin\n\nSir William Henry Perkin, FRS (12 March 1838 – 14 July 1907) was a British chemist and entrepreneur best known for his serendipitous discovery of the first synthetic organic dye, mauveine, made from aniline. Though he failed in trying to synthesise quinine for the treatment of malaria, he became successful in the field of dyes after his first discovery at the age of 18.\n\nPerkin set up a factory to produce the dye industrially. Lee Blaszczyk, professor of business history at the University of Leeds, states, \"By laying the foundation for the synthetic organic chemicals industry, Perkin helped to revolutionize the world of fashion.\"\n\nWilliam Perkin was born in East End of London, the youngest of the seven children of George Perkin, a successful carpenter. His mother, Sarah, was of Scottish descent and moved to East London as a child. He was baptized in the Anglican parish church of St Paul's, Shadwell, which had been connected to such luminaries as James Cook, Jane Randolph Jefferson (mother of Thomas Jefferson) and John Wesley.\n\nAt the age of 14, Perkin attended the City of London School, where he was taught by Thomas Hall, who fostered his scientific talent and encouraged him to pursue a career in chemistry.\n\nIn 1853, at the age of 15, Perkin entered the Royal College of Chemistry in London (now part of Imperial College London), where he began his studies under August Wilhelm von Hofmann. At this time, chemistry was still primitive: although the major elements had been discovered and techniques to analyze the proportions of the elements in many compounds were in place, it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds. Hofmann had published a hypothesis on how it might be possible to synthesise quinine, an expensive natural substance much in demand for the treatment of malaria. Having become one of Hofmann's assistants, Perkin embarked on a series of experiments to try to achieve this end.\n\nDuring Easter vacation in 1856, Perkin performed some further experiments in the crude laboratory in his apartment on the top floor of his home in Cable Street in east London. It was here that he made his great accidental discovery: that aniline could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. Perkin, who had an interest in painting and photography, immediately became enthusiastic about this result and carried out further trials with his friend Arthur Church and his brother Thomas. Since these experiments were not part of the work on quinine which had been assigned to Perkin, the trio carried them out in a hut in Perkin's garden to keep them secret from Hofmann.\n\nThey satisfied themselves that they might be able to scale up production of the purple substance and commercialise it as a dye, which they called mauveine. Their initial experiments indicated that it dyed silk in a way which was stable when washed or exposed to light. They sent some samples to a dye works in Perth, Scotland, and received a very promising reply from the general manager of the company, Robert Pullar. Perkin filed for a patent in August 1856, when he was still only 18.\nAt the time, all dyes used for colouring cloth were natural substances, many of which were expensive and labour-intensive to extract—and many lacked stability, or fastness. The colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times, was especially expensive and difficult to produce, as the dye used, known as Tyrian purple, was made from the glandular mucus of certain molluscs. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and so Perkin and his brother realised that they had discovered a possible substitute whose production could be commercially successful.\n\nPerkin could not have chosen a better time or place for his discovery: England was the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, largely driven by advances in the production of textiles; the science of chemistry had advanced to the point where it could have a major impact on industrial processes; and coal tar, the major source of his raw material, was an abundant by-product of the process for making coal gas and coke.\n\nHaving invented the dye, Perkin was still faced with the problems of raising the capital for producing it, manufacturing it cheaply, adapting it for use in dyeing cotton, gaining acceptance for it among commercial dyers, and creating public demand for it. He was active in all of these areas: he persuaded his father to put up the capital, and his brothers to partner with him to build a factory; he invented a mordant for cotton; he gave technical advice to the dyeing industry; and he publicised his invention of the dye. \n\nPublic demand was increased when a similar colour was adopted by Queen Victoria in Britain and by Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, in France, and when the crinoline or hooped-skirt, whose manufacture used a large quantity of cloth, became fashionable. Everything fell into place: with hard work and lucky timing, Perkin became rich. After the discovery of mauveine, many new aniline dyes appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.\n\n\nWilliam Perkin continued active research in organic chemistry for the rest of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including \"Britannia Violet\" and \"Perkin's Green\"; he discovered ways to make coumarin, one of the first synthetic raw materials of perfume, and cinnamic acid. (The reaction used to make the last became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. \n\nIn 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did. \n\nDuring the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.\n\nPerkin died in 1907 of pneumonia and other complications resulting from a burst appendix. He is buried in the grounds of Christchurch, Harrow, Middlesex.\n\nPerkin married Jemima Harriet, the daughter of John Lissett, in 1859, which resulted in two sons, (William Henry Perkin Jr. and Arthur George Perkin). Perkin's second marriage was in 1866, to Alexandrine Caroline, daughter of Helman Mollwo. They had one son (Frederick Mollwo Perkin) and four daughters. All three sons became chemists.\n\nPerkin received many honours in his lifetime. In June 1866, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1879, received their Royal Medal and, in 1889, their Davy Medal. He was knighted in 1906, and in the same year was awarded the first Perkin Medal, established to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of his discovery of mauveine. Today, the Perkin Medal is widely acknowledged as the highest honour in the U.S. industrial chemistry and has been awarded annually by the American section of the Society of Chemical Industry.\n\nPerkin was a Liveryman of the Leathersellers' Company for 46 years and was elected Master of the Company for the year 1896–97.\n\nToday blue plaques mark the sites of Perkin's home in Cable Street, by the junction with King David Lane, and the Perkin factory in Greenford, Middlesex.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, search engine Google showed a Google Doodle to mark Perkin’s 180th Birthday.\n\nIn 2013, the William Perkin Church of England High School opened in Greenford, Middlesex. The school is operated by the Twyford Church of England Academies Trust (which also operates Twyford Church of England High School). The school is named after William Perkin, and has adopted a mauve uniform and colour scheme, in tribute to his discovery of mauveine.\n\nSince 2007, when Imperial College London gained its own Royal Charter, the Academic dress of Imperial College London features purple across the range of garments to celebrate the work of Perkin. In 2015, President of the College, Professor Alice Gast, stated that: \"The colour purple symbolises the spirit of endeavour and discovery, and the risk-taking nature that characterises those with an Imperial education and training.\"\n\n"}
