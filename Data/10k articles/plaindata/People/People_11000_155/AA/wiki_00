{"id": "35270691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35270691", "title": "Al St. John filmography", "text": "Al St. John filmography\n\nAl St. John (1893-1963) was an American comic actor who appeared some 350 or more films between 1913 and 1952. Starting at Mack Sennett's Keystone Film Company, St. John rose through the ranks to become one of the major comedy stars of the 1920s, though less than half of his starring roles still survive today. With the advent of sound drastically changing and curtailing the two-reel comedy format, St. John diversified, creating a second career for himself as a comic sidekick in Western films and ultimately developing the character of \"Fuzzy Q. Jones,\" for which he is best known in posterity.\n\nSt. John's first starring roles were made at Keystone, but most of these were made at the very end of the history of the company, just as Mack Sennett was abandoning the \"Keystone\" moniker in order to extricate himself from the Triangle Film Corporation partnership. St. John got a second chance at solo stardom starting in 1919 with Paramount Pictures and the early Warner Bros. studio, and this led to extended series of 2-reel comedies for Fox Film Corporation and Educational Pictures. Al St. John starred in more than 70 2-reel comedies through 1932. This is the most important part of his personal legacy, but it remains the least accessible part of his activity. Changes to this list are inevitable, and are welcomed.\n\n\"Fuzzy Q. Jones\" was developed when Al St. John filled in for actor Fuzzy Knight on a film Knight was unable to make. St. John made more than 80 western films in this character, which proved indispensable to the PRC studio and so popular that \"Fuzzy Settles Down\" (1944) remains the only American B-Western that is titled after the sidekick. In post-war Germany, where Fuzzy was especially popular, he was always billed in the title of his pictures, despite the presence of the hero. It was as Fuzzy—whom Al came to regard as a separate person, apart from himself—that St. John finished out his long film career.\nThese films had, in many cases, multiple theatrical distributors, and most of the PRCs were re-released in the 1950s by Madison Pictures, though in some instances in cut down versions. In cases where a television vendor is the more likely medium through which one may see a given title, the vendor is listed in the distribution field is given rather than the original theatrical distributor. A listing for a home video does not automatically mean that the title is still available for viewing. All of these films were made in sound, and are extant.\n\nAl St. John's association with his uncle, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, was central to his film career. Arbuckle first brought St. John to the Keystone set in 1913; over the years to follow, Arbuckle routinely employed St. John in playing rubes, rivals and other parts in support of his popular \"Fatty\" character. When Arbuckle left Keystone in early 1917 to form the Comique Comedy unit at Paramount, he and St. John were joined by stage comedian Buster Keaton, and the three created a singular cycle of silent comedies that exploited their matched acrobatic abilities and hard-driving capabilities in slapstick. This section represents onscreen appearances in films by St. John with either Arbuckle, Keaton or both, and it remains the most accessible area of Al St. John's silent comedy work. Arbuckle-directed comedies starring Al St. John are listed in the \"Starring Al St. John\" section above. \n\nUpon his arrival at Keystone, Al St. John was swiftly absorbed into the Keystone repertory company; he appeared in more 1914 films than Charlie Chaplin did. After Keystone, St. John appeared in support of other comics in 2-reelers up to the end of the silent era. Appearances in films with Roscoe Arbuckle are included in the list above. This list may be incomplete, as the full extent of St. John's appearances of this kind is not known, owing to so many lost films that may serve as possible candidates. For Keystones, the principal actor is included, though in many cases it is unclear who within the film that may be. Owing to the ensemble nature of many early Keystones, there are films which essentially do not have a central comedian as the fixture, and outside of Charlie Chaplin, survival rates on Keystones are less than what would be ideal. Unconfirmed appearances are not included in this list. \n\nWith the dawn of sound around 1930, Al St. John went from appearing almost exclusively in two-reel shorts to appearing almost exclusively in features. While his Fuzzy Q. Jones roles dominate St. John's feature output, he did appear in a number of features in other parts, mostly in Westerns. Some of these, particularly his serio-comic turn as \"Uncle Billy\" in The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1937), demonstrate a greater range of acting ability than the average Fuzzy Q. Jones role might suggest. Several parts listed here, however, are the tiniest of tiny bit roles.\n\nAl St. John\n\n"}

His rifles feature a tubular magazine under the barrel similar to a Winchester rifle; the cartridge lifter was the key to the Kropatschek design. One of his designs was sold to the French Navy, and was later adapted by the French Army in the development of the prolific Lebel rifle, which served as France's front-line rifle from 1886 through the First World War. According to historian Roger A Pauly, some people joked that more bullets from Kropatschek-designed rifles were fired at the Austrians, than by them. Kropatschek's tubular magazine design was also adapted to the German Mauser Model 1871 rifle, resulting in the Model 71/84.\n\nKropatschek was a contemporary of Ferdinand Mannlicher in their affiliations with the Steyr munitions company, but they had competing designs. The Steyr Kropatschek rifles featured the tubular magazine and the Steyr Mannlicher rifles featured a box magazine. The limiting factors of the tubular magazines were: a risk of pointed tip bullets firing the primer of the next cartridge in the tube, and the lack of magazine capacity for short weapons such as carbines (shorter tubes). An advantage of the box magazine is quick reloading by inserting a full clip or by a stripper-clip.\n\nModel 1881 Gendarmarie Carbine (also known as \"M1874/81\") <br>\n1881 Type Trials Rifles\n\nModel 1878 Navy rifle (\"Fusil de Marine Mle 1878\"), <br>\nModel 1884 Infantry Rifle (\"Fusil d'Infanterie Mle 1884\"), <br>\nModel 1885 Infantry Rifle (\"Fusil d'Infanterie Mle 1885\").\n\nModel 1886 8 mm Infantry Rifle (\"Espingarda de Infantaria 8 mm m/1886\"), <br>\nModel 1886/89 8 mm Infantry Rifle with heat protecting handguard for colonial use (\"Espingarda de Infantaria 8 mm m/1886/89\"), <br>\nModel 1886 8 mm Light Infantry Carbine (\"Carabina de Caçadores 8 mm m/1886\")<br>\nModel 1886 8 mm Cavalry Carbine (\"Carabina de Cavalaria 8 mm m/1886\").\n"}

{"id": "58998605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58998605", "title": "Awamir", "text": "Awamir\n\nThe Awamir () (singular Al Amiri ) is a Bedouin Arab tribe in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman. Warlike, fiercely independent and frequently murderous, they were camel breeders, raiders and occasionally date farmers before settling in the 1960s.\n\nThe Awamir roamed across the whole Oman peninsula, from Muscat and Nizwa to Abu Dhabi and Liwa. The Awamir in the area of Abu Dhabi were considered affiliated to the Bani Yas and frequently supported them in conflicts. A large tribe, the Awamir originated in the steppes to the north of the Hadhramut, settling in the north in a process of migration which took place over 500 years. A subsection of the tribe, 'Afar, was linked to Dhafrah. Some 4,000 Awamir settled outside of Oman proper at the turn of the 20th century and of the whole tribe, numbered at the time as 10,000 strong, some 3,500 were nomadic Bedouin.\n\nJ. G. Lorimer characterised the Awamir as \"Reputed brave and warlike but crafty, treacherous and predatory; they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet...\"\n\nIn 1848, Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan was spurred into action against the Wahhabis encamped in Buraimi, capturing his two forts back with the help of the Awamir. The Awamir formed part of the tribal confederacy force he then pulled together and used to clear the oasis and block a relieving army under Sa'ad bin Mutlaq. By 1850, Saeed's great tribal association had cleared Buraimi Oasis of Wahhabi forces. He subsequently accepted a stipend from the Sultan of Muscat for the defence of Buraimi.\n\nThe Awamir supported Saeed's successor, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan in his extended war with Qatar in the 1880s, a series of conflicts that secured the western border of Abu Dhabi. By the 1920s, the Awamir were central to a number of conflicts between the tribes around Buraimi and Abu Dhabi town, fighting with the Manasir, Duru and Bani Qitab.\n\nBy the 1930s, the decline of pearling on the Trucial Coast had led to a general recession and the Awamir's raiding activities grew as demand for their camels and services as drivers dropped. The raids on Dubai alone were part of the general unrest (in a time of depression and poverty) felt by the people against their Ruler, Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum Bin Hasher Al Maktoum, leading to the Majlis movement. In 1931 alone several such incidents included raids on camel trains, on settlements and date groves and, in at least one case, sheer vandalism in retaliation against a ruler's punishment of them: they cut down 20 unripe date palms in Umm Al Quwain following an outbreak of looting. This raiding led to open conflict between tribes and Abu Dhabi found itself called to account on behalf of its unruly subjects as raids led to open and bloody warfare between tribes. For the first time, the British were forced to intervene in matters of the interior and broker an agreement between Abu Dhabi and Dubai over their border and the terms of a peace between the tribes.\n\nThe Awamir had long been in conflict with the Duru and in the 1940s, the ongoing conflict led the headman of the Bedouin Awamir, Salim bin Hamad bin Rakkad, to lead his people to Al Hasa in 1943. They returned in 1948, but in subsequent years were constantly drawn back to Hasa. The bulk of the tribe remained at Buraimi and petitioned the Al Bu Falah for protection. One of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan's first acts when he was appointed \"wali\" of Al Ain was to call for Salim bin Mussalam bin Hamm and appoint him as head of the Bedouin Awamir. The portion of the tribe which had moved south under Salim bin Hamad became Saudi citizens and this schism within the Awamir was later to form part of the territorial arguments put forward in the Buraimi Dispute.\n\nBy the 1950s, some 50 families of the Awamir had acquired date plantations in Buraimi but few settled in Liwa. Staunchly nomadic and focused on breeding and herding camels, the Awamir had no interests in the pearling beyond casual work on the boats and remained essentially nomadic.\n\nBy 1968, some 1,721 members of the Awamir were identified in a census, many of whom had taken up employment with the oil companies.\n"}

According to the Bhai Bala Janam Sakhi's, he travelled with Guru Nanak and Bhai Mardana on all of their great journeys around the world including China, Mecca, and around India. He supposedly died in Khadur Sahib, in his late 70s, in 1544. There is currently ongoing debate surrounding the existence of Bhai Bala.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion as regards to Bhai Bala's existence, particularly within the Sikh academic field. The reasons for this are:\n\nBhai Gurdas, who has listed all Guru Nanak's prominent disciples (in his 11th Var), does not mention the name of Bhai Bala (this may be an oversight, for he does not mention Rai Bular either). However Bhai Mani Singh's Bhagat Ratanwali, which contains essentially the same list as that by Bhai Gurdas, but with more detail, also does not mention Bhai Bala. There are a number of other anomalies, which Dr. Kirpal Singh has explicated in his Punjabi work `Janamsakhi Tradition.'\n\nProfessor Surjit Hans also notes that the only role of Bhai Bala was to denigrate the name of Nanak and that Guru Nanak prophesizes about a greater bhagat (Hundal) to come:\n\n\"The first clue to grasping the true character of the Bala Janamsakhi is the fact that the persons related most closely to Guru Nanak are presented in uncomplimentary light. His father, Kalu, for instance, is a cruel man; he is greedy and ill spoken; he blames Mardana for spoiling his son; and Guru Nanak is rather chary of meeting him. Guru Nanak’s wife regrets marrying him, she is hot-tempered and full of anger. His mother-in-law is quarrelsome and hardhearted. His father-in-law curses his fate to have a son-in-law like Guru Nanak. The Guru’s constant companion, Mardana, is pleased with counterfeit coins and cast off clothes; he is all the time hungry.\"\n\nAlso in the Bhai Bala Janamsakhi are several language inconsistencies. For example, the Sikh salutation 'Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh' is used in the Bala Janamsakhi, however this term only gained currency during the reign of Guru Gobind Singh.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31118318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31118318", "title": "Bob Dalton (outlaw)", "text": "Bob Dalton (outlaw)\n\nRobert Rennick Dalton (May 13, 1869 – October 5, 1892), better known as Bob Dalton, was an American outlaw in the American Old West. He led the ill-fated Dalton Gang raid on two banks in Coffeyville, Kansas. Ambushed by town citizens, Bob, Bill Power, Grat Dalton and Richard L. \"Dick\" Broadwell were all killed.\n\nThe Dalton family came from Jackson County, Missouri. Dalton's father, Lewis Dalton, was a saloon keeper in Kansas City, Kansas, when he married Adeline Younger, the aunt of Cole and Jim Younger. By 1882, the family moved to northeast Oklahoma, then known as the Indian Territory, and by 1886 they had moved to Coffeyville in southeast Kansas. Bob was one of 13 of the couple's 15 children who survived to maturity. His siblings included: Frank, Grat, Bill and Emmett.\n\nBob acquired a reputation for being dangerous after he killed a man at age 19. A deputy at the time, he claimed the killing was in the line of duty. The victim, however, was suspected of flirting with a man that Bob liked.\n\nBob's older brother Frank was a U.S.A.U. (meaning?) Deputy Marshal and Bob served with him on several posses. Frank was killed by a gang of horse thieves, the Smith-Dixon Gang, on November 27, 1887 and Bob may have been part of that posse. After that incident Bob wished to be commissioned as a Deputy Marshal in the Western District at Fort Smith, Arkansas and was assigned to work for the Wichita, Kansas Court. Additionally, Dalton also served as the Chief of police for the Osage Nation while he was with the Kansas court.\n\nOn August 26, 1889, Dalton was sent to Coffeyville, Kansas to arrest a man named Charley Montgomery, who was charged with illegally selling whiskey and stealing horses in Indian Territory. Montgomery resisted arrest and drew his guns forcing Dalton to kill him with his pistol. Since there was no bounty on Montgomery Dalton did not receive any payment when he returned with Montgomery's corpse to Fort Smith. When no one claimed the outlaw's body, as was the custom of the time, Dalton was required to pay for the burial.\n\nIn April 1890, both Dalton and his brother Grat were sent to Claremore, Indian Territory to arrest Alex Cochran who had been accused of killing U.S. Deputy Marshal Cox. The Daltons followed a rider fitting the description of the fugitive but the rider attempted to distance himself from the two deputies. The man refused to stop so, from a distance of 300 yards, Bob shot both the rider and his horse. The dead man, unfortunately, was Cochran's son, not Alex himself.\n\nWhile Dalton continued to work as Police chief for the Osage Nation rumors began that he and his youngest brother Emmett were illegally selling whiskey to the Indians and the brothers became involved in a noisy disturbance with them. U.S. Commissioner Fitzpatrick called Bob Dalton in from the field, when he heard of the news, to demand his badge and discharge him from his position. Angered, Dalton claimed that he resigned, rather than being dismissed, over being cheated him out of several expenses. Charged with selling liquor in Indian Territory he would pay his bail but not appear for his trial.\n\nIn July 1890, Bob, Grat, and Emmett were accused of stealing horses near Claremore to sell them in Kansas. With a posse close behind of them Bob and Emmett left the territories for California where brother Bill was residing. Grat was arrested for the crime but would gain his release because of a lack of evidence. He would join his brothers in California.\n\nOn the night of February 6, 1891 the Daltons raided a train operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad, near Alila, stealing $60,000. The boys were accused of the crime causing Bob and Emmett to flee the state, with a posse after them, while Grat and Bill were arrested. Grat would be found guilty on July 3, 1891 after a jury trial.\n\nBob and Emmett retreated to the Indian Territories, but the law was still after them, so they decided to hide themselves. When Emmett worked, previously, at the Bar X Bar Ranch he became friends with cowboys Bill Doolin and Bill Power. Acquaintances of Emmett from other ranches included Charlie Pierce, George Newcomb, Charlie Bryant, and Richard Broadwell. Bob, as gang leader, decided they needed reinforcements and the future gang recruits were tough men who would help the brothers rob banks and trains throughout the Oklahoma Territory over the following 18 months.\n\nThe Dalton boys, at first, connected with Bryant and Newcomb in Wharton, Oklahoma Territory to rob a train in May 1891 earning $1745. Shortly after the robbery, Bryant fell ill and was taken to Hennessey to see a doctor. After being spotted and arrested by Deputy Marshal Ed Short they killed each other during an escape attempt. \n\nOn the night of September 15, 1891 they robbed the KATY train at Leliaetta, near Wagoner, Indian Territory. Bob and Emmett Dalton led Newcomb, Powers, Broadwell, Pierce and Doolin on the raid. The gang stopped and boarded the train and then stole $2500 from the express car.\n\nGrat escaped from jail on Sept. 18 while awaiting sentence in California and promptly returned to Oklahoma to rejoin his brothers. At the end of May 1892 the three Dalton brothers led Pierce, Newcomb, Powers, Broadwell, and Doolin on another train robbery. At the Red Rock train station, June 1, 1892, the gang positioned themselves to await an approaching train. A train entered the station with its coaches dark, which alerted the gang to a problem, so they allowed it to continue. A second train suddenly arrived which the gang boarded as it stopped at the station. They gang boarded it and robbed it but only collected $50. The gang later ed that the first train carried armed guards protecting $70,000 of the Sac and Fox Nation annuity.\n\nThe gang made its last train robbery at Adair, Indian Territory on July 14, 1892. The train was again loaded with deputies, but the gang was quick and quiet enough not to disturb the marshals until the job was nearly completed. Exiting from the train the marshals engaged the gang in a violent but short gun battle. The battle claimed the life of an innocent bystander and wounded another. The Dalton Gang escaped without casualties and with the cash.\n\nThe gang split to pursue their own goals after the Adair raid. Bob and his brothers were deeply concerned with the pressure put upon them by the law. They decided to make one last robbery to earn enough money to leave the country. Their plan was to rob two banks in the same town at the same time to get the money and to also make history for accomplishing something that no other outlaw gang had even attempted. Their target was their old hometown of Coffeyville, Kansas.\n\nEarly on Oct. 5 1892, Bob, Grat, Emmett, Powers and Broadwell entered Coffeyville. Tying up their horses in the alley across from the banks, they walked across the street dividing into two groups before entering the Condon National Bank and First National Bank. Well known by the townspeople they were recognized and an alarm was given. Townsmen quickly armed themselves with guns from the local hardware stores and took positions to defend their town. As the Dalton Gang began their escape a gun battle erupted that killed gang members and four town citizens. The lone survivor among the gang, Emmett, was seriously wounded receiving 23 gunshot wounds and he stood trial for the bank robberies after recovering. Sentenced to life in prison, he was granted a pardon by the governor after 14 years. \n\nDeputy Marshal Heck Thomas remembered Bob Dalton as the most accurate shot he had ever seen. Dalton is buried at the Coffeyville, Kansas Cemetery under a group marker for himself, his brother Grat, and Bill Power.\n\nThe actor Forrest Tucker played Bob Dalton in the 1963 episode \"Three Minutes to Eternity\" of the syndicated western television series \"Death Valley Days\", a dramatization of the simultaneous bank robberies in Coffeyville. Tom Skerritt portrayed the surviving Emmett Dalton; Jim Davis was cast as Grat Dalton. The episode was narrated by Stanley Andrews, known as \"The Old Ranger\".\n\nIn 1975 Bob Dalton was played by the actor Robert Conrad in the TV movie western \"The Last Day\".\n"}

In the Gallo-British heraldic tradition, cadency marks have been available to \"difference\" the arms of a son from those of his father, and the arms of brothers from each other, and traditionally this was often done when it was considered important for each man to have a distinctive individual coat of arms and/or to differentiate the arms of the head of a house from junior members of the family. This was especially important in the case of arms of sovereignty: to use the undifferenced arms of a kingdom is to assert a claim to the throne. Therefore, in the English royal family, cadency marks were used from the time of Henry III, typically a label or bordure alluding to the arms of the bearer's mother or wife. After about 1340, when Edward III made a claim to the throne of France, a blue label did not contrast sufficiently with the blue field of the French quarter of the royal arms; accordingly most royal cadets used labels argent: that of the heir apparent was plain, and all others were charged. Bordures of various tinctures continued to be used into the 15th century.\n\nIn the ordinary system of differences a label of three points (which has also been termed a label with three files) is the distinction of the eldest son during the lifetime of his father. In the oldest rolls of arms the labels are all of five points; but labels of three points were at an early period used interchangeably. Besides being used as mere temporary marks of cadency, labels are also employed as permanent distinctions, borne (like any other charge) by every member of some particular branches of certain families. Labels are the principal cadency marks used in certain royal families. In the British royal family, all labels are \"argent\" (white). The sons and daughters of the sovereign all bear labels of three points argent; that of the arms of the Prince of Wales is plain, but all others are charged. Further descendants of princes bear labels of five points charged. All such differences should be borne on the arms, crest, and supporters.\n\n</div></div>\nThe system of a special mark for difference for each member of the family goes back to the time of Henry III, whose successor, as a prince, placed such a mark on the shield of England. Since 1340 this label has almost always been white, and overlaid with small figures, or charges, such as red crosses of St George. This red cross represents England and its patron saint, and was first borne by Richard of Bordeaux (future king Richard II) before the death of his father Edward, the Black Prince in 1376.

He reigned during his minority, under a Council of Regency, headed by Captain MacMurdo and composed of Jadeja chiefs.\n\nDuring his reign Kutch suffered a severe earthquake in 1819 followed by severe famine in 1823, 1825 & 1832. Further, Kutch was attacked by marauding band from Sindh. Rao Deshalji and his Dewan Devkaran with their mediocre power and the support of their brethren defeated Kesarkhan and Sher Bulandkhan the Muslim marauding band. Also they defeated the evil designs of Sindh’s Nagarparkar.\n\nDeshalji although 18 years of age took the management of law in his own hands. The trade with Africa especially Zanzibar improved significantly. Slowly and steadily the industrialization in Kutch got a setback which was started by Lakhpatji and Godji. The maritime trade with Zanzibar and Oman grew. Also the glass factory started during reign of Lakhpatji by Ram Singh Malam at Madhapar helped industrialization. Further, breeding of good quality Kutchi horses was also encouraged by Deshaliji, which brought in fair amount of revenue. In the period of Deshalji II steps were taken to suppress infanticide, sati and the slave trade in the State. The educational system was also improved.\n\nHe had eight wives and several sons of which Pragmalji II was declared Yuvraj by him, who ascended the throne after his death in 1860. One of his queens is responsible for erection of present-day temples at Narayan Sarovar.

A popular author of children's fiction at the turn of the 20th century, he published over forty volumes of his work between 1884 and 1914.\n\nHe was a prolific historical novelist, many of his books being set in Czarist Russia, and his \"schoolboy\" and adventure serials appeared in many boys' magazines of the era. Several of these were published as full-length novels, such as \"Gubbins Minor and Some Other Fellows\" (1897), \"The Boys of Brierley Grange\" (1906) and \"The Competitors: A Tale of Upton House School\" (1906). Other stories, such as \"The White Witch of the Matabele\" (1897) or \"The Three Scouts: A Story of the Boer War\" (1900), depicted colonial Africa.\n\nWhishaw was also one of the first translators of Fyodor Dostoevsky, the first in the English language. He had several of the Russian author's novels published between 1886 and 1888.\n\nFrederick James Whishaw was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, to English-born parents, Bernard Whishaw of Cheltenham and Isabel Maria Cattley, on 14 March 1854; he was one of eight children. His family had been in Russia since the 18th century. Eight weeks after his birth, his parents moved the family back to Great Britain and settled in Paignton, Devon where Whishaw would spend much of his childhood. He was educated at Leamington College and then at Uppingham where became an accomplished sportsman and tenor. He was also popular among his classmates for the food hampers he often received from Russia.\n\nAt age 16, Whishaw left school and returned to St. Petersburg to work for an office firm. He spent much of his recreational time running and rowing. He also had a collection of verses, \"Loves of the Flowers\", published in 1878. Unhappy with his occupation, Whishaw left \"Hills & Whishaw\" and eventually emigrated to England after his marriage to Ethel Charlotte Moberly on 30 March 1880. Their first and only child, Gwendolen, was born on 13 January 1884. Returning to his childhood home of Paignton, he began a career as a musician and soon became a well-known and successful tenor.\n\nDuring this time, he also began translating the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky which was published by Henry Vizetelly between 1886 and 1888. His efforts eventually resulted in many of Dostoevsky's novels being made available for English-language readers in Victorian Britain for the first time.\n\nWhishaw was soon inspired to try his hand at writing and had his semi-autobiography, \"Out of Doors in Tsarland: A Record of the Seeings and Doings of a Wanderer in Russia\", published in 1893. A year later, his wrote his first children's novel, \"Boris the Bear-Hunter\", followed by ten more novels between 1895 and 1898, including his first collection of English \"schoolboy\" stories, \"Gubbins Minor and Some Other Fellows\". These and other stories were published as popular serials in many boys' adventure magazines throughout his career.\n\nHis schoolboy stories were a mix of gentle humor and more serious themes of public school life such as theft, house matches, and other common behavior of the time. It was his Russian-themed children's adventure stories and historical novels for which he was best known. Several of these stories took place in other parts of the world, such as colonial Africa, as seen in \"The White Witch of the Matabele\" (1897), and focused on then-current events like \"The Three Scouts: A Story of the Boer War\" (1900). Whishaw also wrote several books on Russian history, most notably the well-received \"Moscow: A Story of the French Invasion of 1812\" in 1905. He wrote his final novel, \"A Bespoken Bride\", in 1914 though many of his earlier stories continued to be reprinted for years afterwards. Whishaw died at his home in Slapton, Devon on 8 July 1934.\n\n\n"}

Between 1904 and 1917 he published \"The Word\". In 1950 he founded The Word Foundation, Inc. to keep \"Thinking and Destiny\" and all of his other works in print.\n\nHarold Waldwin Percival was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, British West Indies in 1868 to parents of English descent. When his father died his mother moved to the United States, eventually settling in New York City.\nEven as a young boy, Harold Percival was a seeker of truth. He was convinced that there were \"wise ones\" who could answer his many questions and impart knowledge. As a young man, one of his first experiences on his quest for knowledge came in 1892 when he joined the Theosophical Society. He would later help to organize the Theosophical Society Independent of New York and for many years serve as its president while also writing and lecturing.\n\nIn 1893, and twice during the next 14 years, Percival had the unique experience of being \"conscious of Consciousness,\" a potent spiritual and noetic enlightenment. He stated that the value of that experience was that it enabled him to know about any subject by a process he called \"real thinking.\" Because these experiences revealed to him more than was contained in Theosophy, he wanted to share this knowledge with humanity.\n\nIn 1902 Percival started to develop his own system. For over 30 years he worked on the manuscript that would lead to the writing of his magnum opus, \"Thinking and Destiny\", now more than 65 years in print. He subsequently published three books expanding upon topics in the light of his system: \"Man and Woman and Child\" (1951), \"Masonry and Its Symbols\" (1952 ) and \"Democracy Is Self-Government\" (1952).\n\nBetween 1904 and 1917 Mr. Percival published \"The Word\", a magazine with a worldwide circulation dedicated to the brotherhood of humanity. Percival's own articles earned him a place in Who's Who in America (1928–29).\n\nIn 1950, The Word Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization, was established for the purpose of making known to the people of the world the writings of Harold W. Percival.\n\nPercival’s works were noted as a major influence upon Richard Matheson, the famous science-fiction author. He said that his book \"The Path\" (1998) was based largely on \"Thinking and Destiny\".\n\nIn the book, \"The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self\", 1999, by Owen Slight, the author states that Harold W. Percival’s \"Thinking and Destiny\", like the Bhagavad Gita, reveals relevant, instructive and long lasting lessons regarding the higher self and the human plight—long lost lessons of everlasting truth contained both in the Sanskrit \"Bhagavad Gita\" and \"Thinking and Destiny\". Both books contain complete systems of knowledge. The plight of Arjuna is shown by Percival to be our own.\n\n\nPercival wrote the following editorials for \"The Word\" between 1904 and 1917:\n\n"}
{"id": "189451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189451", "title": "Ion Iliescu", "text": "Ion Iliescu\n\nIon Iliescu (; born 3 March 1930) is a Romanian politician who served as President of Romania from 1989 until 1996, and from 2000 until 2004. From 1996 to 2000 and from 2004 until his retirement in 2008, Iliescu was a senator for the Social Democratic Party (PSD), of which he is honorary president.\n\nHe joined the Communist Party in 1953 and became a member of its Central Committee in 1965. However, beginning with 1971, he was gradually marginalized by Nicolae Ceaușescu. He had a leading role in the Romanian Revolution, becoming the country's president in December 1989. In May 1990, he became Romania's first freely elected head of state. After a new constitution was approved by popular referendum, he served a further two terms as president, from 1992 to 1996, and from 2000 to 2004, separated by the presidency of Emil Constantinescu, who defeated him in 1996.\n\nIliescu is widely recognized as a predominant figure in the first fifteen years of post-revolution politics. During his presidency, Romania joined NATO. In April 2018, Ion Iliescu was charged in Romania with committing crimes against humanity during the deadly aftermath of the country's 1989 revolution. \n\nIliescu's father, Alexandru Iliescu, was a railroad worker with Communist views during the period in which the Romanian Communist Party was banned by the authorities. In 1931, he went to the Soviet Union to take part in the Communist Party Congress of Moscow. He remained in the USSR for the next four years and was arrested upon his return. He was imprisoned from June 1940 to August 1944 and died in August 1945. During his time in the Soviet Union, Alexandru Iliescu divorced and married Marița, a chambermaid.\n\nIliescu married Nina Șerbănescu in 1951; they have no children, not by choice but because they could not, as Nina had three miscarriages. Born in Oltenița, Iliescu studied fluid mechanics at the Bucharest Polytechnic Institute and then as a foreign student at the Energy Institute of the Moscow University. During his stay in Moscow, he was the secretary of the \"Association of Romanian Students\" it is alleged that he met Mikhail Gorbachev, although Iliescu always denied this. However, years later, president Nicolae Ceaușescu probably believed that there was a connection between the two, since during Gorbachev's visit to Romania in July 1989, Iliescu was sent outside of Bucharest to prevent any contact.\nHe joined the Union of Communist Youth in 1944 and the Communist Party in 1953 and made a career in the Communist nomenklatura, becoming a secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth in 1956 and a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965. At one point, he served as the head of the Central Committee's Department of Propaganda. Iliescu later served as Minister for Youth-related Issues between 1967 and 1971.\n\nHowever, in 1971, Ceaușescu felt threatened by Iliescu, who was seen as Ceaușescu's heir apparent. He was marginalized and removed from all major political offices, becoming vice-president of the Timiș County Council (1971–1974), and later president of the Iași Council (1974–1979). Until 1989, he was in charge of the Editura Tehnică publishing house. For most of the 1980s (if not before), he was tailed by the Securitate (secret police), as he was known to oppose Ceaușescu's harsh rule.\n\nThe Romanian Revolution began as a popular revolt in Timișoara. After Ceaușescu was overthrown on 22 December (he was executed on Christmas Day), the political vacuum was filled by an organization named National Salvation Front (FSN: \"Frontul Salvării Naționale\"), formed spontaneously by second-rank communist party members opposed to the policies of Ceaușescu and non-affiliated participants in the revolt. Iliescu was quickly acknowledged as the leader of the organization and therefore of the provisional authority. He first learned of the revolution when he noticed the Securitate was no longer tailing him.\nIliescu proposed multi-party elections and an \"original democracy\". This is widely held to have meant the adoption of \"Perestroika\"-style reforms rather than the complete removal of existing institutions; it can be linked to the warm reception the new regime was given by Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership, and the fact that the first post-revolutionary international agreement signed by Romania was with that country.\n\nIliescu did not renounce Communist ideology and the program he initially presented during the revolution included restructuring the agriculture and the reorganization of trade, but not a switch to capitalism. These views were held by other members of the FSN as well, such as Silviu Brucan, who claimed in early 1990 that the revolution was against Ceaușescu, not against communism. Iliescu later evoked the possibility of trying a \"Swedish model\" of socialism.\n\nRumours abounded for years that Illiescu and other second-rank Communists had been planning to overthrow Ceaușescu, but the events of December 1989 overtook them. For instance, Nicolae Militaru, the new regime's first defense minister, said that Illiescu and others had planned to take Ceaușescu prisoner in February 1990 while he was out of the capital. However, Illiescu denies this, saying that the nature of the Ceaușescu regime—particularly the Securitate's ubiquity—made advance planning for a coup all but impossible.\n\nThe National Salvation Front decided to organize itself as a party and run in the 1990 general election—the first free election held in the country in 53 years. It won a sweeping victory, taking over 70% of the votes. In the separate presidential election, Iliescu won handily, taking 85 percent of the vote. He thus became Romania's first democratically elected head of state, and the first since 1947 who was not a Communist or fellow traveler.\n\nIliescu and his supporters split from the Front and created the Democratic National Salvation Front (NSDF), which later evolved into the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), then the Social Democratic Party (PSD) (see Social Democratic Party of Romania). Progressively, the Front lost its character as a national government or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not enjoy this status, nor the credibility.\n\nUnder the pressure of the events that led to the Mineriads, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent of \"Perestroika\", Iliescu recast himself as a Western European social democrat. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, and especially to the strong nationalist and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceaușescu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most communist-to-social democrat changes in the Eastern bloc, Romania's tended to retain various cornerstones.\n\nThe new Constitution was adopted in 1991, and in 1992 he won a second term when he received 61% of the vote. He immediately suspended his NSDF membership; the Constitution does not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term. After the June 16, 1991 bridge of flowers, Mircea Snegur, then President of the Republic of Moldova, proposed in August Iliescu the union of the two countries. Snegur would become the Vice President of Romania. However, his proposal was ignored. He ran for a third time in 1996 but, stripped of media monopoly, he lost to Emil Constantinescu. Over 1,000,000 votes were cancelled, leading to accusations of widespread fraud.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election Iliescu ran again and won in the run-off against the ultra-nationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor. He began his third term on 20 December of that year, ending on 20 December 2004. The center-right was severely defeated during the 2000 elections due largely to public dissatisfaction with the harsh economic reforms of the previous four years as well as the political instability and infighting of the multiparty coalition. Tudor's extreme views also ensured that most urban voters either abstained or chose Iliescu.\n\nIn the PSD elections of 21 April 2005, Iliescu lost the Party presidency to Mircea Geoană, but was elected as honorary president of the party in 2006, a position without official executive authority in the party.\n\nThough enjoying a certain popularity due to his opposition to Ceaușescu and image as a revolutionary, his political career after 1989 was characterized by multiple controversies and scandals. Public opinion regarding his tenure as president is still divided.\n\nSome alleged Iliescu had connections to the KGB, the allegations continued during 2003–2008, when Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, who had been granted access to Soviet archives, declared that Iliescu and some of the NSF members were KGB agents, that Iliescu had been in close connection with Mikhail Gorbachev ever since they had allegedly met during Iliescu's stay in Moscow, and that the Romanian Revolution of 1989 was a plot organized by the KGB to regain control of the country's policies (gradually lost under Ceaușescu's rule). The only hard evidence published was a discussion between Gorbachev and Bulgaria's Aleksandar Lilov from 23 May 1990 (after Iliescu's victory in the May 20 elections) in which Gorbachev says that Iliescu holds a \"calculated position\", and that despite sharing common views with Iliescu, Gorbachev wanted to avoid sharing this impression with the public.\n\nHe, along with other figures in the leading FSN, was allegedly responsible for calling the Jiu Valley miners to Bucharest on 28 January and 14 June 1990 to end the protests of the citizens gathered in University Square, Bucharest, protests aimed against the ex-communist leaders of Romania (like himself). The pejorative term for this demonstration was the Golaniad (from the Romanian \"golan\", rascal). On 13 June, an attempt of the authorities to remove from the square around 100 protesters, which had remained in the street even after the May elections had confirmed Iliescu and the FSN, resulted in attacks against several state institutions, such as the Ministry of Interior, the Bucharest Police Headquarters and the National Television. Iliescu issued a call to the Romanian people to come and defend the government, prompting several groups of miners to descend on the capital, armed with wooden clubs and bats. They trashed the University of Bucharest, some newspaper offices and the headquarters of opposition parties, claiming that they were havens of decadence and immorality – drugs, firearms and munitions, \"an automatic typewriter\", and fake currency. The June 1990 Mineriad in particular was widely criticized both at home and internationally, with one historian (Andrei Pippidi) comparing the events to Nazi Germany's Kristallnacht. Government inquiries later established that the miners were infiltrated and instigated by former Securitate operatives. In February 1994 a Bucharest court \"found two security officers, Colonel Ion Nicolae and warrant officer Corneliu Dumitrescu, guilty of ransacking the house of Ion Rațiu, a leading figure in the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, during the miners’ incursion, and stealing $100,000.\"\n\nIn 1992, three years after the revolution which overthrew the Communist dictatorship, the Romanian government allowed King Michael to return to his country for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds. In Bucharest over a million people turned out to see him. Michael's popularity alarmed the government of President Ion Iliescu, so Michael was forbidden to visit Romania again for five years. In 1997, after Iliescu's defeat by Emil Constantinescu, the Romanian Government restored Michael's citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country.\n\nIn December 2001, Iliescu pardoned three inmates convicted for bribery, including George Tănase, former Financial Guard head commissioner for Ialomița. Iliescu had to revoke Tănase's pardon a few days later due to the media outcry, claiming that \"a legal adviser was superficial in analyzing the case\". Later, the humanitarian reasons invoked in the pardon were contradicted by another medical expert opinion. Another controversial pardon was that of Dan Tartagă—a businessman from Brașov that, while drunk, had run over and killed two people on a pedestrian crossing. He was sentenced to three years and a half but was pardoned after only a couple of months. Tartagă was later sentenced to a two-year sentence for fraud.\n\nMost controversial of all, on 15 December 2004, a few days before the end of his last term, Iliescu pardoned 47 convicts, including Miron Cozma, the leader of the miners during the early 1990s, who had been sentenced in 1999 to 18 years in prison in conjunction with the September 1991 Mineriad. This has attracted harsh criticism from all Romanian media. Many of the pardoned had been convicted for corruption or other economic crimes, while one had been imprisoned for his involvement in the attempts at suppressing the 1989 Revolution.\n\nIn the last days of his President mandate, he awarded the National Order \"Steaua României\" (rank of ceremonial knighthood) to the ultra-nationalist controversial politician Corneliu Vadim Tudor, a gesture which drew criticism in the press and prompted Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, fifteen Radio Free Europe journalists, Timișoara mayor Gheorghe Ciuhandu, songwriter Alexandru Andrieș, and historian Randolph Braham to return their Romanian honours in protest. The leader of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, Béla Markó, did not show up to claim the award he received on the same occasion. President Traian Băsescu revoked the award granted to Tudor on 24 May 2007, but a lawsuit is ongoing even after Băsescu's decree was declared constitutional.\n\nIon Iliescu is mentioned in the report of the Council of Europe investigator into illegal activities of the CIA in Europe, Dick Marty. He is pointed out as one of the people who authorized or at least knew about and have to stand accountable for torture prisons at Mihail Kogălniceanu airbase from 2003 to 2005. In April 2015, Iliescu confirmed that he had granted a CIA request for a site in Romania, but was not aware of the nature of the site, describing it as a small gesture of goodwill to an ally in advance of Romania's eventual accession to NATO. Iliescu further stated that had he known of the intended use of the site, he would certainly not have approved the request.\n\n\n\n"}

His first teacher was his father, Avraham ben Shabtai Sheftel Horowitz, a notable scholar and author, and a disciple of Moses Isserles (Rema). Horowitz studied under Meir Lublin and Joshua Falk. He married Chaya, daughter of Abraham Moul, of Vienna, and was a wealthy and active philanthropist, supporting Torah study, especially in Jerusalem. In 1590, in Lublin, he participated in a meeting of the Council of Four Lands, and his signature appears on a decree that condemns the purchase of rabbinic positions.\n\nIn 1602, Isaiah Horowitz was appointed Av Beit Din in Austria, and in 1606 was appointed Rabbi of Frankfurt. In 1614, after serving as rabbi in prominent cities in Europe, he left following the Fettmilch Uprising and assumed the prestigious position of chief rabbi of Prague.\n\nIn 1621, after the death of his wife, he moved to Palestine, was appointed rabbi of the Ashkenazi community in Jerusalem, and married Hava, daughter of Eleazer. In 1625, he was kidnapped and imprisoned, together with 15 other Jewish rabbis and scholars, by the Pasha (Ibn Faruh) and held for ransom. After 1626, Horowitz moved to Safed, erstwhile home of Kabbalah, and later died in Tiberias on March 24, 1630 (Nisan 11, 5390 on the Hebrew calendar).\n\nIn his many kabbalistic, homiletic and halachic works, he stressed the joy in every action, and how one should convert the evil inclination into good, two concepts that influenced Jewish thought through to the eighteenth-century, and greatly influenced the development of Hasidic Judaism.\n\nFamous descendants of Isaiah Horowitz included Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin (known as \"The Seer of Lublin\"), the prominent Billiczer rabbinical family of Szerencs, Hungary and the Dym family of rabbis and communal leaders in Galicia. Aaron HaLevi ben Moses of Staroselye, one of the most prominent student of Shneur Zalman of Liadi, founder of Chabad, the Fruchter-Langer families and Rabbi Meir Zelig Mann of Memel, Lithuania (b. 1921, d. 2008).\n\nHis most important work \"Shenei Luḥot HaBerit\" (, \"Two Tablets of the Covenant\", abbreviated \"Shelah\" ), is an encyclopedic compilation of ritual, ethics, and mysticism.

The title page of the first edition states that the work is \"compiled from both Torahs, Written and Oral, handed down from Sinai\". The work has had a profound influence on Jewish life - notably, on the early Hasidic movement, including the Baal Shem Tov; Shneur Zalman of Liadi was described as a \"Shelah Yid\", and \"Shelah\" clearly echoes in his work, \"Tanya\". The work was first published in 1648 by his son, Shabbethai Horowitz, and has been often reprinted, especially in an abbreviated form. (See also in the Hebrew Wikipedia).\n\nHorowitz also wrote the \"Sha'ar ha-Shamayim\" siddur (prayer book) which had an influence on the later Ashkenazi \"nusach\".\n\nRabbi Horowitz wrote that the eve of the first day of the month of Sivan is the most auspicious time to pray for the physical and spiritual welfare of one's children and grandchildren, since Sivan was the month that the Torah was given to the Jewish people. He composed a special prayer to be said on this day, known as the \"Tefillat HaShlah\" \"the Shelah's Prayer\". In modern times, the custom of saying this prayer on the appointed day has become very popular among Orthodox parents.\n\n\n\n"}

Benson's partner Hal Woodward invented modern full text computer indexing and searching in 1981 based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation – the search system was called FARA (FAR Automated), and Benson exploited the new field through companies he co-founded. Benson was active in the early days of Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In the early 1990s, he assembled a large collection of help files that became the predecessor to today's IRChelp.org.\n\nBenson was a founding member of the Personal Spaceflight Federation. Benson was on the Board of Directors of the California Space Authority from 2005 to 2007 was named one of the \"50 People to Watch in 2005\" by San Diego magazine, and was named 2005 \"Alumnus of the Year\" by the University of Missouri at Kansas City. He founded the non-profit Space Development Institute, and introduced the Benson Prize for Amateur Discovery of Near Earth Objects. Benson was Vice-Chairman and private sector representative on NASA's national Space Grant Review Panel. Benson received a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City, in his hometown.\n\nAfter a successful career as a computer industry entrepreneur, Benson decided to take on the challenge of starting a space commercialization venture. It combined his lifelong interests in science, technology and astronomy with his successful business experience.\n\nBenson started the trend of successful high tech entrepreneurs moving into the space development arena, by incorporating SpaceDev, Inc. as a publicly owned space exploration and development company in 1997.\n\nBenson and SpaceDev worked to develop the world's first private sector enterprise to profitably explore and develop space beyond earth orbit. SpaceDev's mission is to help \"make space happen\" for all of humanity, through the development of a comprehensive private space program, by delivering affordable and practical space technologies, products and solutions to SpaceDev's government and commercial customers, while creating value for SpaceDev stockholders.\n\nBenson searched NASA's archives and \"saw the HL-20's potential as a project that had already received huge amounts of development money. [The vehicle had] friendly flying characteristics combined with a thick pedigree of expensive studies.\" \nSpaceDev licensed the HL-20 technology from NASA and extended it to use for its new Dream Chaser suborbital spacecraft. Later, the Dream Chaser became a candidate for NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Program for delivering cargo to and from the International Space Station. In the event, SpaceDev was not selected for award under COTS, but did sign a non-reimburseable Space Act Agreement to facilitate additional exchange of non-cash project milestones with NASA.\n\nAfterwards, Benson stepped down as Chairman of SpaceDev and founded the Benson Space Company to pursue the Dream Chaser project. \"In the fall of 2007, Benson Space announced a partnership with United Launch Alliance to turn the Dream Chaser into an orbital vehicle by launching it on an Atlas V rocket. Benson and his team were going to try to go all the way to orbit.\"\n\nSpaceDev acquired the former Integrated Space Systems, a space systems engineering firm, in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, SpaceDev and its chairman James Benson were named in an administrative proceeding alleging securities fraud. The SEC alleged that SpaceDev and chairman Benson made false and misleading statements through various media in an attempt to increase its stock value. A settlement was later agreed upon that states that the SEC was founded in its allegations and SpaceDev cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Mr. Benson cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nSpaceDev acquired the intellectual property of American Rocket Company in 1999 after AMROC's 1996 bankruptcy. The AMROC-derived hybrid rocket motors were used in several SpaceDev projects that followed.\n\nSpaceDev started developing the science mission CHIPSat for the University of California, Berkeley in 1999. In 2003, SpaceDev launched the United States' smallest, low-cost, high performance satellite named CHIPSat for NASA. CHIPSat is a suitcase-size science microsatellite that is also the first U.S. mission to use only TCP/IP Internet communications for end-to-end satellite operations control, becoming the first satellite whose mission control and operations center is any laptop computer located anywhere in the world. Although the nominal mission duration was one year, the satellite operated successfully for almost five years when mission was terminated in April 2008.\n\nIn 2004, SpaceDev's hybrid rocket motors were used by Burt Rutan's SpaceShipOne to win the $10 million Ansari X Prize.\n\nDuring his 10 years with the company, Benson served as founder, chairman, chief executive officer and chief technology officer of SpaceDev. He stepped down on September 28, 2006 to announce that he was starting a new venture called Benson Space Company.\n\nJim Benson announced on September 28, 2006 that he had launched an ambitious new venture focused on commercial space tourism, Benson Space Company.\n\n, Benson Space stated intentions to be first to market in the emerging multibillion-dollar space tourism or personal spaceflight industry, with the safest and lowest cost astronaut-making suborbital missions.\n\n\"I am dedicated to opening space for all of humanity and, with SpaceDev well-managed and growing, I plan to spend the next several years creating the possibility that anyone who wants to go to space will be able to, safely and affordably,\" said Benson in September, 2006. SpaceDev owns many of the patents and intellectual property rights associated with hybrid rocket motors used for safe human spaceflight. Under Benson's guidance, SpaceDev developed critical hybrid rocket motor technology and furnished all of the rocket motors for Paul Allen's SpaceShipOne, the craft that earned the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004.\n\nBenson Space had completed its first round of financing and submitted a request for proposal to SpaceDev for the design and development of its SpaceDev Dream Chaser spaceships. BSC expected to be one of SpaceDev's largest customers, purchasing multiple spaceships and safe hybrid rocket motors for use in personal spaceflight.\n\nSpaceDev announced on October 10, 2008, that James Benson had died earlier that day. He had been diagnosed with Glioblastoma multiforme, a type of brain tumor, in the spring of 2008.\n\n"}

{"id": "156475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156475", "title": "Jean-Pierre Boyer", "text": "Jean-Pierre Boyer\n\nJean-Pierre Boyer (possibly 15 February 1776 – 9 July 1850) was one of the leaders of the Haitian Revolution, and President of Haiti from 1818 to 1843. He reunited the north and south of Haiti in 1820 and also annexed by force the newly independent Spanish Haiti (Santo Domingo), which brought all of Hispaniola under one Haitian government by 1822. Boyer managed to rule for the longest period of time of any of the revolutionary leaders of his generation.\n\nBoyer was born in Port-au-Prince and was the son of a French tailor, and an African mother; a former slave from Guinea. He was sent to France by his father to become educated. During the French Revolution, he fought as a battalion commander, and fought against Toussaint Louverture in the early years of the Haitian Revolution. He later allied himself with André Rigaud, also of mulatto ancestry, in the latter's abortive insurrection against Toussaint to try to keep control of the southern region of Saint-Domingue.\n\nAfter going into exile in France, Boyer and Alexandre Pétion, returned in 1802 with the French troops led by General Charles Leclerc. After it became clear the French were going to try to reimpose slavery and restrictions on free \"gens de couleur\", Boyer joined the patriots under Pétion and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who led the colony to independence. After Pétion rose to power in the State of Haiti in the South, he chose Boyer as his successor. He was reportedly under the influence of his (and his predecessor's) lover, Marie-Madeleine Lachenais, who acted as his political adviser.\n\nWhen Santo Domingo became independent late in 1821, Boyer was quick to occupy and gain control, uniting the entire island under his rule by 9 February 1822. Boyer ruled the island of Hispaniola until 1843, when he lost the support of the ruling elite and was ousted.\n\nAfter the uprising of African slaves in the north of Saint-Domingue in 1791, Boyer joined with the French Commissioners and went there to fight against the \"grand blancs\" (plantation owners) and royalists. In 1794, Saint-Domingue was invaded by British forces trying to capitalize on the unrest in the formerly wealthy colony. Boyer went to Jacmel, where he joined forces with mulatto leader, General André Rigaud. While other mulatto leaders surrendered to Toussaint Louverture in southern Saint-Domingue, Boyer escaped to France with Rigaud and Alexandre Pétion.\n\nAt the time, the United States supported French efforts to re-establish control, although it sent 20,000 troops. Boyer traveled to Paris, where he stayed until 1801.\n\nNext, he returned to Haiti to protest the independence that Toussaint Louverture had just achieved. By early 1802, Rigaud and other leaders learned that the French intended to take away the civil rights of mulattoes and re-institute slavery for former slaves in Saint-Domingue (as they had managed to do in Guadeloupe.) They sent General LeClerc to defeat the rebels, and over the next 21 months, added to his forces by 20,000 troops. Boyer collaborated with other native leaders to defeat the French. In November 1803, France withdrew its surviving 7,000 troops, less than one-third of the forces sent to the island. Most had died as a result of yellow fever, which was endemic to the island.\n\nJean-Jacques Dessalines, a former slave from the North, declared Haitian independence on 1 January 1804. He established himself as Emperor Jacques I. He was assassinated by opponents in 1806.\n\nAlexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe competed to rule Haiti, and represented the split between the urban mulatto elite of the South and the black former slaves of the North, respectively. After years of warfare, they established separate states: Pétion continuing the Republic of Haiti in the southern part of Haiti, and Christophe creating the State (later Kingdom) of Haiti in the north.\n\nIn 1818 Pétion died and Boyer replaced him as the second President of the Republic of Haiti. This was an arranged transition since Pétion had selected Boyer for his succession and the Senate approved his choice. The 1816 revised constitution provided for the President to select his successor as a measure to protect the nation from foreign intrusion. Joseph Balthazar Inginac also continued as the President's secretary and right hand.\n\nBoyer believed Haiti had to be acknowledged as an independent nation, and that this could be established only by cutting a deal with France. On 11 July 1825, Boyer signed an indemnity treaty stipulating that Haiti would pay France a certain amount of money to compensate for the lost property in slaves and trade in exchange for formal diplomatic recognition of its independence.\n\nAs soon as Boyer came to power, he was confronted with the continuing competition with Henri Christophe and the Kingdom of Haiti in the north. Christophe's autocratic rule created continued unrest in the Kingdom of Haiti. After his soldiers rebelled against him in 1820, in failing health and fearing assassination, Christophe committed suicide. Boyer reunited Haiti without a single battle.\n\nOn 30 November 1821, several frontier towns near the border with Santo Domingo raised the Haitian flag as a show of independence. The new nation was known as the Republic of Spanish Haiti. On 1 December 1821, the leaders of the new nation resolved to unite it with Gran Colombia. \n\nBut, some politicians and military officers in Santo Domingo favored unification with the Republic of Haiti. Former slaves sought to secure emancipation under the Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer. Another faction based in Dajabon, near the border, opposed union with Gran Colombia and supported Boyer. \n\nBoyer sought to protect his country from the danger of France or Spain re-taking Santo Domingo and attacking or re-conquering Haiti. He wanted to maintain Haitian independence and secure the freedom of the slaves in Santo Domingo.\n\nAfter promising protection to several Dominican frontier governors and securing their allegiance, in February 1822 Boyer annexed the newly independent state with a force of 50,000 soldiers. These forces encountered little resistance from the considerably smaller Dominican population. On 9 February 1822, Boyer formally entered the capital city, Santo Domingo, where Núñez de Cáceres handed over the keys to the city. Dominicans reacted uneasily to the Haitian invasion. \n\nThe island of Hispaniola was now united under one government from Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana. By awarding land to Haitian military officers at the expense of former members of the Spanish forces of Santo Domingo, Boyer reduced his influence with the Spanish-Haitian leadership. He continued the policy of Pétion, his former political mentor, of helping free people of color in other Spanish-American colonies to resist the Spanish crown. Boyer ignored Haitian political opponents who called for reforms, such as parliamentary democracy, and veteran generals of the War of Independence, who believed that the revolution was not complete and that they were being neglected. \n\nBoyer, and his assistants, Joseph Balthazar Inginac and Jonathas Granville, were deeply involved with the massive migration of black Americans to Haiti in 1824. Yet, this event did not happen in a vacuum. Neither did the migrants respond reflexively to the promises the Haitian government offered. The migration is often called a failure because of the 6,000 (or more) migrants, a couple or more thousands returned to the U.S. However, those who stayed often had a different assessment of the migration. The term failure, then, should be applied to the prospects the Haitian government had with the migrants and the idea many white philanthropists in the U.S. had of relocating the entire black population out of the country. None of these two objectives were met. Yet, for the descendants of the migrants now living in the Peninsula of Samaná and those who also assimilated into the local culture, the migration gave them the opportunity to find new life on the island, and often, to interact in a wider black diaspora through commerce and industry—their knowledge of the English language gave them an edge in Haiti.\n\nThe American Colonization Society (ACS) noticed the recruitment effort. Concerned that free blacks could never assimilate to the United States, its members founded their society in 1816 to \"repatriate\" American blacks to Africa, regardless of where they had been born. It was an uneasy collaboration between abolitionists and slaveholders, who approached the issue from differing viewpoints. The ACS planned colonization in what became Liberia for former slaves. In 1817 Loring D. Dewey toured the East Coast to recruit emigrants, starting in New York. The organization hoped to resettle 100,000 free people of color within 10 years.\n\nDewey's meetings with people in New York convinced him to abandon the idea of colonizing Liberia. Most American blacks did not want to leave what they considered was fully their native country. Dewey met with Haitian citizens in New York, most of whom were refugee ethnic French and free people of color who had fled the revolution. They recommended Haiti as the ideal black homeland, due to its moderate weather conditions and independent black government. After Dewey wrote to Boyer to determine if he was still interested in receiving American immigrants, Boyer proposed that Haiti would seek blacks exclusively from the United States.\n\nThe ACS sent Boyer questions related to its goal of a colony for American free blacks. Boyer was confident that his government would be able to receive these people. The ACS tried to negotiate to have the Haitian government pay transportation costs for the emigrants. Boyer responded that the government would pay for those who could not afford it, but the ACS would have to take care of the rest of the finances. Haiti was already in debt to the French, which had exacted high payment for lost properties of planters, in essence making Haiti pay for its independence. The government did not have funds to transport American families to Haiti.\n\nDewey proposed establishing a colony for American free blacks that would be separate from the rest of the island, with its own laws, legislature, etc. Boyer was opposed to the idea of an American colony on the island, since the Haitians already feared re-colonization by the French. He told Dewey that the laws of the Haitian government applied to everyone across Haiti.\n\nBeginning in September 1824, nearly 6,000 Americans, mostly free people of color, migrated to Haiti within a year, with ships departing from New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia. Due to the poverty of the island and the inability of Boyer's administration to help support the new immigrants in the transition, most returned to the United States within a short period of time.\n\nBoyer was anxious to eliminate the threat from France and opened negotiations. An agreement was reached on 11 July 1825, when Boyer signed an indemnity treaty. It stated that France would recognize Haiti as an independent country in return for 150 million francs paid within five years. While this sum was later reduced to 90 million francs (in 1838), it was a crushing economic blow to Haiti.\n\nBoyer had to negotiate a loan from France of 30 million francs to pay the first part of the indemnity. Most of the largely rural Haitian population meanwhile was retreating into an agricultural subsistence pattern. He tried to enforce the semi-feudal \"fermage\" system in order to increase agricultural productivity on the island, but the people resisted being tied to other people's lands. With the Rural Act, Boyer resurrected a land distribution program. He broke up some of the large plantations and distributed land to the small farmers. To try to produce enough products for export to generate revenue, the government \"tied\" the rural population to their smallholdings and established production quotas.\n\nBoyer's rule lasted until 1843, when the poor economic situation was worsened by an earthquake. The disadvantaged majority rural population rose up under Charles Rivière-Hérard in late January. On 13 February 1843, Boyer fled Haiti to nearby Jamaica. He eventually settled in exile in France, where he died in Paris in 1850. Descendants of Boyer still live in Haiti.\n\nHaiti was the first government of an independent state that recognised the Greek revolution against the Ottoman Empire. Jean-Pierre Boyer, following a Greek request for assistance, addressed a letter on 15 January 1822. In the letter sent to Greek expatriates living in France, Adamantios Korais, Christodoulos Klonaris, Christodoulos Klonaris, Konstantinos Polychroniades and A. Bogorides, who had assembled themselves into a Committee which was seeking international support for the ongoing Greek revolution, expressed his support for the Greek Revolution and compared the struggle underfoot across the Atlantic to the struggle for independence in his own land. He apologized for being unable to support the Revolution in Greece financially, though he hoped he might be able to in the future. But he articulated his moral and political support for the revolution, notably by filling his letter with references to classical Greek history, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of this history and powerfully evoking the contemporary revolutionaries as the rightful heirs of their ancestors. \n\nSome historians claim that Boyer also sent to the Greeks 25 tons of Haitian coffee that could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons, but not enough evidence exists to support this or the other claim that one hundred Haitian volunteers set off to fight in the Greek Revolution. Allegedly, their ship was boarded by pirates somewhere in the Mediterranean and these fighters purportedly never reached their destination.\n\nBelow is the letter to the Greeks:\n\n\"JEAN PIERRE BOYER\n\nPresident of Haiti\n\nTo the citizens of Greece A. Korais, K. Polychoroniades, A. Bogorides and Ch. Klonaris.\n\nIn Paris\n\n\"Before I received your letter from Paris, dated last August 20, the news about the revolution of your co-citizens against the despotism which lasted for about three centuries had already arrived here. With great enthusiasm we learned that Hellas was finally forced to take up arms in order to gain her freedom and the position that she once held among the nations of the world.\nSuch a beautiful and just case, most importantly, the first successes which have accompanied it, cannot leave Haitians indifferent, for we, like the Hellenes, were for a long time subjected to a dishonorable slavery and finally, with our own chains, broke the head of tyranny.\n\nWishing to Heavens to protect the descendants of Leonidas, we thought to assist these brave warriors, if not with military forces and ammunition, at least with money, which will be useful for acquisition of guns, which you need. But events that have occurred and imposed financial restrictions onto our country absorbed the entire budget, including the part that could be disposed by our administration. Moreover, at present, the revolution which triumphs on the eastern portion of our island is creating a new obstacle in carrying out our aim; in fact, this portion, which was incorporated into the Republic I preside over, is in extreme poverty and thus justifies immense expenditures of our budget. If the circumstances, as we wish, improve again, then we shall honorably assist you, the sons of Hellas, to the best of our abilities.\n\nCitizens! Convey to your co-patriots the warm wishes that the people of Haiti send on the behalf of your liberation. The descendants of ancient Hellenes look forward, in the reawakening of their history, to trophies worthy of Salamis. May they prove to be like their ancestors and guided by the commands of Miltiades, and be able, in the fields of new Marathon, to achieve the triumph of the holy affair that they have undertaken on behalf of their rights, religion and motherland. May it be, at last, through their wise decisions, that they will be commemorated by history as the heirs of the endurance and virtues of their ancestors.\n\nIn the 15th of January 1822 and the 19th year of Independence\"\n\nBOYER\"\n\n\n"}

Kane served with the Royal Air Force in various European theatres as a radio operator in World War II, before joining GCHQ after the war. While serving with GCHQ in Hong Kong, Kane was concerned with the lack of security and after uncovering fraud, raised his complaints with officials. Kane retired in 1978 and his complaints were investigated by a senior civil servant, but the report was never published. Kane wrote a memoir in 1984, \"GCHQ: The Negative Asset\", which was subsequently banned, as was a second memoir, \"The Hidden Depths of Treachery\". Kane later worked as a milkman after retiring from GCHQ.\n\nKane was born in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, in 1921, his mother died in childbirth when he was two. Raised by his father with the help of aunts, he was educated at St Patrick's High School in Coatbridge. Kane was married twice, first to Alexandra in 1949, with whom he had two sons. Kane had met Alexandra in Greece, where she had been a member of the Greek Resistance. Alexandra had been imprisoned during the Second World War for helping to evacuate Allied soldiers stranded there after the Battle of Greece. Kane married Cynthia, his second wife, in 1983. After his marriage to Cynthia, Kane moved to Barton on Sea in Hampshire, where he worked as a milkman and school bus driver.\n\nIn 1939, Kane joined the Royal Air Force, training as a radio operator in Blackpool. With the RAF Kane flew on sorties during the Battle of the Atlantic, tasked with calibrating radar signals, to help combat the threat of German submarines to Allied shipping. Kane also served with RAF squadrons supporting allied forces in North Africa and Italy, and was sent into occupied Yugoslavia in 1944, and Greece.\nAfter leaving the RAF at the end of the war, Kane was recruited by intelligence agency GCHQ in November 1946. He was posted to a listening station at Hawklaw, near Cupar in Fife, Scotland. Raw intelligence material would be supplied by Hawklaw to Bletchley Park (known as X-Station) to be de-coded. During the Cold War, the target of Kane's interception efforts at Hawklaw were the Soviet Union and its allies behind the Iron curtain. Much of the material collected at Hawklaw would be subsequently transferred to the United States National Security Agency for further analysis. The Cupar station was one of a number of British Y-stations, monitoring the radio communications of Soviet naval vessels.\nKane served with GCHQ in Istanbul, Aden, Singapore, Hong Kong and Belfast. He retired from GCHQ in November 1978.\n\nBy the early 1970s Kane had been working for GCHQ for more than 25 years, having worked in almost every section of the organisation. In 1973, Kane uncovered fraud in GCHQ, concerned with subsistence allowances. Staff sent on training courses had been collecting their full allowance over a weekend, when they were already home. Fraud that Kane found in the GCHQ outpost of Little Sai Wan in Hong Kong concerned employees renting apartments at lower rates than their £600 rent allowance, then submitting false invoices for the higher amount, and sharing the difference with their Chinese landlords. Kane had worked in Hong Kong until 1976. Senior GCHQ officers were also involved in the fraud, and Kane found that senior management at GCHQ were not interested in his complaints. Kane believed that these activities could expose staff to blackmail by hostile intelligence agencies. A spy ring had already been uncovered in Little Sai Wan, with 150 people arrested for spying in Hong Kong from 1970–1976. His allegations also concerned the loss of secret documents and the collection of material from wastepaper baskets by Chinese cleaners, which he had established by intercepting communications between Chinese intelligence agents.\n\nLax security at GCHQ was another target of Kane's allegations. Kane said that there were no proper controls of photocopiers, with no record of the number of copies taken. In addition, too many people had access to highly classified material, and staff were often found in high-security areas without the necessary clearance.\n\nThough Kane was criticised by his GCHQ colleagues for taking security too seriously, he had subsequent meetings with Special Branch, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Security Commission and Member of Parliament Kenneth Warren. Warren subsequently advanced Kane's complaints with Prime Minister James Callaghan. To investigate Kane's complaints Callaghan appointed a senior civil servant from the Home Office, James Waddell. Waddell's report was finished in April 1979, and never published. The new Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, described Kane's allegations as \"unfounded\" to Parliament; as a consequence Waddell hinted to a journalist that his report had not concluded that Kane's allegations were without foundation.\n\nA June 1980 episode of the investigative television show, \"World In Action\", titled \"Mr Kane's Campaign\", was dedicated to Kane's revelations and campaign for stricter security at GCHQ in Hong Kong. The programme was modified after having been restricted from being broadcast by the Independent Broadcasting Authority.\n\nKane's 1984 memoir, \"GCHQ: The Negative Asset\", was confiscated by Special Branch, and remains unpublished. The publishers of his first memoir, Robert Hale, were served with an injunction to prevent its publication. Details of the manuscript of \"The Negative Asset\" were published in \"The Washington Post\" in 1985; Kane denied leaking the manuscript to the newspaper. Copies of the \"Negative Asset\" were seized from its London publisher and from newspapers that had been considering serialization of its contents; police officers from Special Branch also travelled to New York to seize manuscripts.\n\nThe publication of Kane's 1987 memoir, \"The Hidden Depths of Treachery\" was also subsequently halted by an injunction served on the publishers Transworld Publications, Ltd. The two books had been written by Kane following his failure to end what he believed was the widespread existence of fraudulent activities in GCHQ. Kane was never prosecuted for his actions, which took place alongside the Geoffrey Prime affair and the ABC trial. Kane had also provided information to the defendants in the ABC trial. The \"Daily Telegraph\" said that these events gave the \"ring of truth\" to Kane's criticisms.\n\nIn July 1988, Kane made an extended appearance on the \"British Intelligence\" episode of the Channel 4 discussion programme \"After Dark\", alongside Merlyn Rees, Robin Ramsay, H. Montgomery Hyde and others. He discussed with the former home secretary why he had been singled out by the authorities and said, as reported by \"The Scotsman\", \"in reasoned and deliberate voice\": \"Special Branch arrived at my house in Hampshire on a Sunday morning and I endured three days of intense questioning. I was never arrested or charged.\"\n\n"}

He is the son of writer Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. and his first wife, Jane Cox. He is the brother of Edith Vonnegut and Nanette Vonnegut. He described himself in the preface to his 1975 book as \"a hippie, son of a counterculture hero, BA in religion, (with a) genetic disposition to schizophrenia.\"\n\nMark Vonnegut (whom his parents named after Mark Twain) graduated from Swarthmore College in 1969. He briefly worked at Duthie Books and was also briefly chief of a 20-man detachment of special state police that provided the security for Boston State Hospital. During the Vietnam War, he filed an application with the draft board to be considered a conscientious objector, which was denied. After taking the psychological examination, he was given a psychiatric 4F classification and avoided conscription into the U.S. military.\n\nDuring his undergraduate years, he set out to become a Unitarian minister. He eventually abandoned that goal.\n\nHe is the author of \"The Eden Express\" (1975), which describes his trip to British Columbia to set up a commune with his friends and his personal experiences with schizophrenia, which at that time he attributed to stress, diet and in part, drug use. During this period, he lived mainly at the commune at Powell Lake, located 18 kilometers by boat from the nearest road or electricity. The book is widely cited as useful for those coping with schizophrenia.\nHe married in 1975. He had a son, Eli James Vonnegut (b. 1980).\nOn February 14, 1971, he was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia and committed to Hollywood Hospital in Vancouver. Standard psychotherapy did not help him, and most of his doctors said his case was hopeless.\n\nVonnegut first attributed his recovery to orthomolecular megavitamin therapy and then wrote \"The Eden Express\". However, it should be pointed out that in this book, he states that \"approximately a third - improve without any treatment. Whatever shrink happens to be standing around when such remissions occur is usually willing to assume credit\" pg. 267. From the book, one can see that he was trying to decide if it is the therapy or the ever changing medications that are the most effective for treatment. Vonnegut does not presently attribute his recovery to vitamins. In reality, such situations take years of trial and error treatment to figure out what actually is effective treatment since the diagnostic tools are based on statistics (a group of symptoms and how long they last and what is the age of the patient), making them inherently weak on predictability. This is made worse given the short duration of any treatment because of the prohibitive costs of longer term productive treatment. He subsequently studied medicine at Harvard Medical School and later came to the conclusion that he actually had bipolar disorder. Dr. Vonnegut, despite odds against him, graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1979. After graduation, Dr. Vonnegut completed a pediatric Internship and Residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Vonnegut published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine December 27, 2007 and has published several short pieces on pediatrics and other topics in The Boston Globe and The Patriot Ledger. He has served on the National Institute for Health Consensus Conference on ADHD since November 1999. Dr. Vonnegut wrote The Eden Express which was first published in 1975 and re-published in 2002. His new book, \"Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So\", was published October 5, 2010. He has practiced pediatrics for over 30 years, opening his own practice, M.V. Pediatrics, in 2001. Dr. Vonnegut respects the parents’ right to choose what is best for their children, and will support parents' decisions. His practice discourages psychiatric medication use in children, and instead offers therapy via social workers, reiki, yoga, and acupuncture. He is currently a pediatrician in Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\nVonnegut published his second book, \"Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So\", in 2010.

He is the father of Daisy Johnson.\n\nCalvin Zabo appears in the television series \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan.\n\nMister Hyde first appeared in \"Journey into Mystery\" #99 and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck. Mister Hyde is based upon the literary character by Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nHe has appeared as a regular character in \"Thunderbolts\" since issue #157, and remained with the team after the title transitioned into \"Dark Avengers\" beginning with issue #175.\n\nCalvin Zabo was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was a morally abject but brilliant biochemist who was fascinated by the effect of hormones on human physiology. One of his favorite stories was Stevenson's 1886 classic, \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\". He was convinced that the experiment Dr. Jekyll performed in the story could actually be accomplished, and became obsessed with the idea of unleashing his full bestial nature in a superhuman form. However, he needed money to do this, so he robbed his various employers systematically. Though too intelligent to be caught, the medical community was suspicious of his tendency to always be employed by organizations which were subsequently robbed. Zabo eventually sought work as a surgeon in a hospital where Donald Blake was a directing physician, yet Blake would not allow him a job due to his history. Zabo was enraged that Blake would not give him the position, even though he did indeed intend to rob the organization, and swore revenge. He was eventually successful in creating his formula and turned into a huge, Hulk-like creature he called \"Mister Hyde,\" named after the character in the novel. In this new form, he found he had superhuman strength enabling him to crush cars and tear through steel as though it were made of cardboard. With his new superhuman powers he sought out Blake, whom he tried to kill by throwing him from a window, but Blake transformed into Thor by striking his cane on the wall and survived, claiming he had saved Blake. Hyde, hearing of this on the radio, decided to eliminate Thor, and tried to frame him for a bank robbery by using his superhuman strength to tear open a bank vault while disguised as Thor. While Donald and Jane were out, Mister Hyde met and kidnapped them at gunpoint. As Don Blake, Thor was tied up next to a bomb that would explode in 24 hours unless Mr. Hyde defused it. However, when attempting to steal a Polaris submarine to roam the seas like a pirate, Hyde was defeated and the authorities, seeing his superhuman strength, realized he must have impersonated Thor, but Thor was forced to allow him to escape, as Jane Foster thought Blake was still in danger.\n\nHyde went into business as a full-time professional super-criminal and partnered himself with the Cobra to get revenge upon Thor, but they were both defeated despite getting Thor's hammer from him briefly. With the Cobra, he was bailed out and employed by Loki to kidnap Jane Foster, and they battled Thor again. Loki doubled their powers to try to help them. Loki showed Thor where Jane Foster was being held. The house had many traps set up for Thor, and Jane Foster was almost killed in an explosion. Thor was able to defeat both villains, and Mister Hyde was caught by a ray which paralyzed him. Both Hyde and Cobra were jailed, and Jane's life was saved by an Asgardian formula Balder sent to Thor. Hyde and the Cobra escaped prison, but were eventually recaptured by Daredevil. They teamed with the Jester to get revenge, but were defeated again. With the Scorpion, Hyde then battled Captain America and the Falcon. Teaming with the Cobra again, Hyde attempted to acquire Cagliostro's serum. While serving in prison following this failed attempt, Hyde was ensnared by the mind-control power of the Purple Man, and forced to battle Daredevil in an arena alongside Cobra, the Jester, and the Gladiator.\n\nTiring of their repeated failures, the Cobra elected to sever their partnership when he escaped from Ryker's Island, taking the time to taunt Hyde before leaving. Hyde has never forgiven him for the slight. With Batroc, Hyde later blackmailed New York City with a hijacked supertanker and attempted to destroy the entire city in order to kill Cobra. Eventually, he was defeated by Captain America with Batroc's aid. Hyde again stalked Cobra seeking revenge, and this time battled Spider-Man. He was imprisoned again, but escaped Ryker's Island and battled Spider-Man and the Black Cat during another attempt at Cobra's life. Hyde later battled Daredevil again.\n\nHyde later became a member of Baron Helmut Zemo's incarnation of the Masters of Evil and invaded Avengers Mansion along with them, torturing the Black Knight and Edwin Jarvis. With Goliath and the Wrecking Crew, he nearly killed Hercules, but was defeated by the Avengers. Mister Hyde later attempted an escape from the Vault alongside Titania, Vibro, the Griffin, and Armadillo, but was defeated and recaptured by The Captain. He eventually escaped from the Vault alongside the Wizard and others. Hyde was later defeated in combat by the Cobra.\n\nHyde later fought with the Grey Hulk and received head trauma that limited his ability to transform. He was subsequently caught by the police when he coincidentally checked into the same hotel as the one where the \"Daily Bugle\" staff were attending Robbie Robertson's retirement party, allowing Peter Parker to defeat him using an improvised costume. Shortly after, Hyde had several run-ins with the Ghost Rider in which he was defeated with the Penance Stare.\n\nHyde briefly helped the symbiote-bonded Toxin track Cobra after a prison escape by providing a piece of skin for the symbiote to track.\n\nZabo was being held in The Raft (the Ryker's Island Prison complex) 6 months after the events of \"Avengers Disassembled\". When a prison break was caused by the villain Electro, Zabo emerged in his Hyde persona, fought with Daredevil, and was knocked unconscious by Luke Cage.\n\nAt one point, Zabo was discovered by the Young Avengers to be selling a derivative of his Hyde formula on the street as one of the various illegal substances known as Mutant Growth Hormone.\n\nZabo grafts abilities similar to the powers of Spider-Man to homeless teenagers. After Spider-Man revealed his identity during the \"Civil War\" storyline, Zabo sought to recreate the circumstances of Spider-Man's \"birth\", by taking in orphans off the street, imbuing them with spider-powers, and seeing whether or not the teenagers would give in to their darker impulses. During the ensuing battle with Spider-Man, Hyde pulled webbing off his face, taking his eyelids with it, and was hit in the face with hydrochloric acid, courtesy of one of his own guinea pigs. It is stated by Spider-Man that he has been left blinded and had his face ruined as a result. Dr. Curt Connors was later seen aiding Spider-Man in a cure for Calvin, one of Zabo's test subjects.\n\nHyde's daughter is Daisy Johnson, who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.; her mother was apparently a prostitute with whom Calvin Zabo regularly had 'business', and the girl was put up for adoption after birth. Daisy subsequently manifested superpowers inherited from Zabo's mutated genetic code.\n\nThe Hood hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.\n\nLater he was seen along with Firebrand, King Cobra, and Mauler, who attacked Yellowjacket, Constrictor and other Initiative staff and trainees.\n\nMister Hyde worked with Boomerang, Tiger Shark, and Whirlwind to manipulate Venom III into procuring Norman Osborn's fortunes. This was thwarted by Venom and Green Goblin as Norman threw a bomb into Mister Hyde's mouth causing him to spit out blood. Norman Osborn then warned Mister Hyde and the villains that if they cross him again, he will kill everyone that they ever loved before they are tortured to death.\n\nMister Hyde joins the Grim Reaper's new Lethal Legion, claiming embarrassment over Norman blowing up his mouth with a bomb.\n\nMister Hyde appears as member of Hood's crime syndicate, during an attack on the New Avengers.\n\nMister Hyde was selected to be a part of the \"beta team\" of the Thunderbolts, alongside Boomerang, Shocker, Gunna and Centurius.\n\nLater, Mister Hyde began a drug operation in California where he came into conflict with Robbie Reyes after his car had some of Mister Hyde's pills inside. Mister Hyde's mercenaries chase Robbie down during the race in order to retrieve the car and the pills. Robbie is gunned down by the mercenaries when he mistakes them for police, and they torch the scene. Robbie is revived as a demonic being called the Ghost Rider who sports a flaming helmet-like head. In this form, Robbie drives off in the car, now similarly ablaze. The Ghost Rider defeats a few mercenaries and soon disappears in an explosion. Robbie eventually fights and defeats Zabo, becoming something of a local hero and urban legend. Having regrouped and refined his Hyde Formula into new blue pills, Calvin Zabo gradually takes over the L.A. criminal underground with his \"Blue Hyde Brigade,\" which includes Guero and his gang, longtime enemies of Robbie, calling themselves the \"Blue Krüe.\"\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Mister Hyde was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nDuring the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Mister Hyde is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil. During Hydra's takeover of the United States, Mister Hyde is one of a few Army of Evil members not in a stasis pod and is shown leading a group of Hydra soldiers to invade New Attilan and capture the Inhumans. He alongside Hydra's Avengers catch his daughter Daisy and her team, the Secret Warriors. During interrogation, Daisy uses her powers to destroy the Helicarrier they're in, forcing Mister Hyde to retreat.\n\nThe process that transforms Dr. Calvin Zabo into his Mr. Hyde persona is a hormonal transformation caused by ingestion of chemical formula. As his body adjusted to its new form, Mr. Hyde's strength, stamina, durability, and resistance to physical injury all increase to superhuman levels. Hyde's powers are sufficient to stand toe to toe with the likes of Thor and survive. He has been shown tearing apart steel in a bank vault with ease. Through further experimental procedures over the years, his strength has been increased beyond its original limits. Mr. Hyde must ingest his special chemical formula periodically to maintain his ability to transform himself from one identity to the other at will; mental fatigue or injury can impair his ability to transform himself into Mr. Hyde. He employs a device that resembles a wristwatch that contains a supply of the formula that he can use to deliver it directly into his bloodstream, enabling him to transform at the push of a button.\n\nDue to the nature of the transformation, Hyde's skin is warped. This gives his face a distorted look reminiscent of the Lon Chaney, Sr. make-up used in \"The Phantom of the Opera\".\n\nDr. Calvin Zabo is a brilliant medical research scientist with a Ph.D. in Medicine and extensive knowledge of biochemistry. These skills are lost to his Hyde persona.\n\nIn the timeline of the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline Mr. Hyde (as well as the Cobra) is a near-feral and cannibal \"Scavenger\". He is known to prowl graveyards and attack anyone entering his territory.\n\nMr. Hyde appeared in the Elseworlds \"\" crossover book. Two-Face partnered with Mister Hyde for a series of technological robberies. In truth, Two-Face had implanted Hyde's brain with the material needed to \"grow\" an experimental \"organic\" computer chip, and fed Hyde pills to keep him enraged. Once grown, the chip would kill Hyde, its current growth also weakening Hyde's strength as his energy is diverted to support the chip (Batman noting during the fight that Hyde should normally have a punch that could knock Superman into orbit). Hyde berates Two-Face, proud he has abandoned his past as Zabo and insults Two-Face for hanging onto his Harvey Dent side, as well as using a coin to decide between right and wrong. Two-Face is glad the process will kill Hyde. In the end, Daredevil uses his past friendship with Dent to talk Two-Face into supplying the antidote for the chip, which saves Hyde's life.\n\nMister Hyde appears as a member of Hood's Masters of Evil. Before the Red Guard attacks Santo Rico, Mister Hyde leaves the team alongside Cobra (Klaus Voorhees), Crossbones (Brock Rumlow), and Thunderball (Eliot Franklin). Mister Hyde was later seen as an Army scientist.\n\nA zombified Mister Hyde appears in \"Marvel Zombies 4\". He is seen attacking the new Midnight Sons, trying to bite one of them, but he is quickly killed by Man-Thing when he rips zombie Mister Hyde apart and holding a huge boulder and dropping it down on him, crushing the zombie Mister Hyde to death instantly.\n\nMr. Hyde is the antagonist of the first two issues of this alternate universe retelling of Thor's origin. Thor, confused and partially amnesiac, stops Hyde from hassling an innocent woman. This drives Hyde into an obsession with Thor's new friend, a museum employee named Jane Foster.\n\n\n\nMister Hyde was ranked #15 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters in 2015.\n"}

For a year between his time at USD and Yale, Erickson served as the national treasurer of the College Republicans in Washington, D.C., whose staff at the time included Grover Norquist, Ralph Reed, and Jack Abramoff. Abramoff later wrote, \"To every college Republican who contacted the national office, Paul Erickson was by far the most impressive person they had ever encountered in politics.\" \n\nAlso while in college, Erickson wrote \"Fritzbusters\", a comedy routine that was critical of Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale which had similarities to the then newly released film \"Ghostbusters\" (1984). Erickson and some fellow College Republicans performed Fritzbusters at the 1984 Republican National Convention and later as a warm-up act for Ronald Reagan at some rallies during the 1984 United States presidential election. The campaign stopped running Fritzbusters after more than 100 students wearing Fritzbusters shirts heckled Mondale in September 1984. Erickson earned a law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1988.\n\nIn addition to his political work while in college, Erickson worked in 1985 as the deputy campaign manager for Richard Viguerie’s unsuccessful campaign for Virginia lieutenant governor.\n\nFrustrated by the tax increase led by President George H.W. Bush, Erickson served as the national political director / campaign manager for the 1992 presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan. A biographer of Buchanan later said Erickson was \"the best there was at the price Pat could afford.\" \n\nErickson later served as an advisor to Mitt Romney for both of his presidential campaigns. He is also a former board member of the American Conservative Union, the group that organizes the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). He was a friend of Andrew Breitbart.\n\nStephen Moore, founder of the right-leaning limited-government group Club for Growth often relies on what he calls Erickson’s “clever and creative ideas.” However, Lee Schoenbeck, a former Republican Watertown Representative to the South Dakota House of Representatives, has called him \"the single biggest phony I’ve ever met in South Dakota politics.\" Casey Phillips, a South Dakota Republican political consultant, has said of Erickson, \"He likes to put people in touch with people. He’s a person that’s at the center of relationships all over the place.\"\n\nErickson worked as an executive producer of \"Red Scorpion\" (1988), an anti-communist action film produced by Jack Abramoff.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, Erickson acted as a media adviser, agent, and lawyer for John Wayne Bobbitt, whose wife Lorena had cut off his penis with a kitchen knife. Erickson booked Bobbitt on an international \"Love Hurts\" tour during which Bobbitt made appearances on television shows such as \"The Howard Stern Show\".\n\nIn 1994, Erickson obtained a $30,000 contract with Jack Abramoff to lobby for entrance into the United States by Mobutu Sese Seko, the military dictator of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who had been banned from the entering the United States due to the corrupt and dictatorial nature of his regime. Mobutu sought a visit to the United Nations to claim credit for this offer, but his visa request was ultimately denied due to his past human rights abuses.\n\nIn 1997, Erickson founded Compass Care, a senior living company based in South Dakota dedicated to developing non-nursing home care options for seniors in the Midwest. This venture led to senior care consulting spinoffs, independent living communities and the licensing of medical technology. Erickson and his companies have amassed at least seven civil court judgments against them over the years. In two such cases, lawsuits by investors in Compass Care alleged that Erickson had predicted investment returns of 25–100% but that neither investor received any returns and that Erickson had reneged on his promises to refund the original investments. One investor won a judgment for $115,417 in 2003 while another obtained a judgment for $190,000 in 2008. Two of Erickson's lawyers withdrew from the second case, one after Erickson wrote him a bad check.\n\nErickson has strong ties to both the National Rifle Association and the Russian gun rights community. He has supported Maria Butina, now in jail awaiting her trial, who is a former assistant to Aleksandr Torshin and the founder of a Russian gun rights group called \"The Right to Bear Arms\". In 2016, Erickson and Butina set up a South Dakota business named \"Bridges, LLC\", which Erickson later said was created to provide financial assistance for Butina's graduate studies. \n\nDuring Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, Erickson attempted to develop a back-channel between the NRA and the Russian government. In May 2016, Erickson sent an e-mail with the subject line \"Kremlin Connection\" to Trump campaign adviser Rick Dearborn asking Dearborn and then-Senator Jeff Sessions for advice on setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin at an annual NRA convention. After Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, Erickson said he was advising his transition team.\n\nErickson, Butina, and Torshin have been part of an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Torshin has also been the subject of a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigations into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency. In July 2018 Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian Federation. In Butina's indictment, federal prosecutors said an unnamed American political operative, later identified as Erickson, had worked with Butina to arrange introductions to influential people inside the U.S. and to advance Russian interests.\n\nErickson served a term on the board of directors of the Institute for Lutheran Theology. \n\nIn 1997 Erickson helped to organize a religious revival service on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Promise Keepers, an Evangelical Christian men's organization. Hundreds of thousands of men participated in the day-long service.\n\nErickson is single and has never married. He has homes in New York, Los Angeles, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nAccording to criminal charges against Butina, Erickson and Butina lived together and were in a sexual relationship, which Butina was using to advance Russian national interests. According to prosecutors, Butina \"privately expressed 'disdain' for him\".\n\n"}

He was educated privately, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827. There he was drawn into a literary set, and became a member of the famous Apostles Club, which then included Alfred Lord Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, Richard Chenevix Trench, Joseph Williams Blakesley, and others. \nAfter graduating with an M.A. in 1831, Milnes travelled abroad, spending some time at the University of Bonn.\n\nHe went to Italy and Greece, and published in 1834 a volume of \"Memorials of a Tour in some Parts of Greece\", describing his experiences.\n\nMilnes returned to London in 1837, and was elected to Parliament as member for Pontefract as a Conservative. \nIn parliament he interested himself particularly in the question of copyright and the conditions of reformatory schools. \nHe left Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel's party over the Corn Law controversy, and was afterwards identified in politics with Lord Palmerston. \nHis easy good nature had the effect that his political career was viewed with less seriousness by his contemporaries than it might otherwise have been. \nIn 1848, he went to Paris to see something of the revolution, and to fraternise with both sides. \nOn his return he wrote, as a ‘Letter to Lord Lansdowne,’ 1848.\nDuring the Chartist riots of 1848, Matthew Arnold wrote to his mother:Tell Miss Martineau it is said here that Monckton Milnes refused to be sworn in a special constable, that he might be free to assume the post of President of the Republic at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 1863, Palmerston elevated Milnes to the peerage as Baron Houghton, of Great Houghton in the West Riding of the County of York.\n\nGeorge W. E. Russell said of him: \"As years advanced he became not (as the manner of most men is) less Liberal, but more so; keener in sympathy with all popular causes; livelier in his indignation against monopoly and injustice.\"\n\nMilnes' literary career was often influenced by church matters. He wrote a tract in 1841, which was praised by John Henry Newman. He took part in the discussion about \"Essays and Reviews\", defending the tractarian position in \"One Tract More\" (1841). He published two volumes of verse in 1838, \"Memorials of Residence upon the Continent and Poems of Many Years\", \"Poetry for the People\" in 1840 and \"Palm Leaves\" in 1844. He also wrote a \"Life and Letters of Keats\" in 1848, the material for which was largely provided by the poet's friend, Charles Armitage Brown. Milnes' ballads were among the most popular of their day. In 1868, Lord Houghton was elected to the Royal Society. In 1870, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.\n\nDespite his piety, he had apparently an almost unsurpassed collection of erotic literature, which he bequeathed to the British Library, a collection known to few in his lifetime. A man whom his biographer Saunders said, \"had many fine tastes and some coarse ones,\" Milnes has been considered a possible author of \"The Rodiad\", a pornographic poem on the subject of flagellation.\n\nHowever, his chief distinctions were his sense of literary merit in others, and the way he fostered it. He was surrounded by the most brilliant men of his time, many of whom he had been the first to acclaim. His reputation rests largely on the part he played, as a man of influence in society and in moulding public opinion on literary matters, in connection with his large circle of talented friends. He secured a pension for Tennyson, helped to make Ralph Waldo Emerson known in Britain, and was one of the earliest champions of Algernon Charles Swinburne. He helped David Gray by writing a preface for \"The Luggie\". He helped to obtain a job for Coventry Patmore at the British Museum. He was, in the traditional sense, a patron of literature, who never abused the privileges of his position.\n\nHe likewise admired the literacy brilliance in female writers and was a firm friend of the Gaskell family of Manchester. A believer in the advancement of women, he supported Meta, the daughter of novelist Elizabeth Gaskell in her work as the Representative of the \"Manchester Ladies' Educational Association\" and on The North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women. The Spectator reported upon Meta's death in 1913 that, \"Lord Houghton once said that the conversation and society to be met with in the house of the Gaskells at Manchester – Plymouth Grove – were the one thing which made life in that city tolerable for people of literary tastes\".\n\nMilnes was a persistent suitor of Florence Nightingale (who finally refused to marry him), and one of her staunchest supporters along with the statesman Sidney Herbert. \nOn 30 July 1851, he married the Honourable Annabel, daughter of John Crewe, 2nd Baron Crewe. She died in 1874. \nLord Houghton died at Vichy, France, in August 1885, aged 76, and was buried at Fryston. \nHe was succeeded in the barony by his son, Robert, who became a prominent Liberal statesman and was created Earl of Crewe in 1895 and Marquess of Crewe in 1911.\n\nThe novelist Florence Henniker was his daughter.\n\nMilnes took interest in parapsychology, he was a member of the Society for Psychical Research.\n\n\n\n"}

She was the mother of Armoni and Mephibosheth (; ).\n\nAfter the death of Saul, according to the Bible, Abner was accused of sleeping with Rizpah, resulting in a quarrel between him and Saul's son and successor, Ishbosheth. () The quarrel led to Abner's defection to David, () who was then king of the breakaway Kingdom of Judah. This incident led to the downfall of Ishbosheth and the rise of David as king of a reunited Kingdom of Israel.\n\nA famine lasting three years hit Israel during the earlier half of David's reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was believed to have happened because of \"Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.\" The Gibeonites were not Israelites, but the remnant of the Amorites, which Saul pursued from within Israel. David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul's sons.()\n\nDavid accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Merab, Saul's eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies at the sanctuary at Gibeah. () Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah, and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, () till they were at length taken down and buried by David () in the family grave at Zelah with the bones of Saul and Jonathan. (2 Samuel 21:14).\n\nBritish rabbi Jonathan Magonet has described Rizpah as \"every mother who sees her sons killed before their time for reasons of state, be they in time of peace or in war. All that remains is for her to preserve the dignity of their memory and live on to bear witness and call to account the rulers of the world\".\n"}

The spiritual institution Paramhans Satyarthi Mission is led and governed by him. He is one of the major saints of Shri Nangli Sahib. He was born as younger son of Shri Paramhans Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj (1897-1986). Shri Paramhans Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj founded Paramhans Satyarthi Mission and in 1985 he anointed Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj as his spiritual successor and the patron saint of the Paramhans Satyarthi Mission. Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj travels around the world and preaches about spirituality and enlightenment. He is also the koshadhyaksh (treasurer) of Shri Nangli Sahib Guru Mandir Trust. Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Trust, Shri Satyarthi Sevadal, Shri Satyarthi High School, and \"Shri Satyarthi Sandesh Magazine\" are also administered in his guidance.\n\nHe was born on 5 September 1943, in a religious family and was named as Shri Khairati Lal Bhardwaj. His father, Pandit Khushiram Bhardwaj was a devotee of Lord Krishna and was a scholar of Sanskrit, Astrology, Vedenta, Shastras and Upanishads. Pandit Khushiram Bhardwaj Ji became a disciple of Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj and adopted a life of renunciation (Sanyas). He was later famed as Shri Swami Ramanand Satyarthi ji Maharaj.\n\nSwami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj acquired knowledge of Rajyoga from Shri Swami Ramanand Satyarthi ji Maharaj. By the age of ten years he used to go into state of super-consciousness (Samadhi) with ease. He continued his practices of Raj Yoga with his schooling and graduation. He also holds a degree of M.A.\n\nShri Swami Advaitanand Ji Maharaj (1846-1919) also known as the \"First Spiritual Master\" of the Shri Paramhans Advait Mat lineage, initiated the \"Second Spiritual Master\", Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj ( also known as Shri Nangli Niwasi Bhagwan Ji) in the early 1900s. Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj was further succeeded by Shri Swami Paramhans Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj. On 2 July 1985(the day Vyas Pooja), Shri Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj declared Shri Khairati Lal Bhardwaj as his spiritual successor and the patron saint of Paramhans Satyarthi Mission and named him as Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj.\n\nSwami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj adopted renunciation (Sanyas) and vowed to publicize the supreme knowledge of Paramhans tradition on 8 January 1995 at Satyarthi Samadhi Mandir, Shri Nangli Sahib. Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj has founded various Satyarthi Dhams (Ashrams) at New Delhi, Haridwar, Lucknow, Chhatarpur, Bareily and Shri Nangli Sahib. Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj organizes Gyan-Yagyas at different places. Paramhans Satyarthi Mission organizes camps for spiritual and moral understanding every year at Rajyog Mandir, New Delhi in which Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj teaches the practices of Dhyana and meditation.\n\nThe primary teachings of Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj are Bhakti, Sewa(Service), Prem (love) and Rāja yoga (meditation). The spiritual institution (Paramhans Satyarthi Mission) led by Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj believes in the principle of Vasudev Kutumbkam. The symbol of the mission is Hans or the swan bird on the lotus flower. \"Satya\" (truth) is the methodology of the mission. Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj preaches the concept and relevance of Advaita Vedanta and self-realization. Advait refers to its idea that the soul (Atman) is the same as the highest metaphysical Reality (Brahman). Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the idea that \"moksha\" is achievable in this life in contrast to Indian philosophies that emphasize moksha after death. Advaita Vedanta is one of the most studied and most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Advaita philosophy is non-dualistic.\n\nRaj yoga is variously referred to as \"royal yoga\", \"royal union\", \"sahaj marg\", \"best of yoga\". Raj yoga refers to the goal of yoga (which is usually samadhi). Raja Yoga meditation is an inwardly oriented practice. Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj teaches the way to meditate on the pious name which is two and a half words powerful mantra. This mantra is given to the devotees as Updesh. It is known to make the person’s life free of all hassles, to show and guide him in the right direction. He has written several books on Rajyog, Sewa, Satya, etc.\n\nIn his view, sewa is the best way of practicing Bhakti. It could be in any way, by going to his temple and physically contributing to the activities happening there, by remembering him in our hearts and doing Pooja (worship) at home, by devoting (as per the wish) to the funds.\n\nBhakti means devotion. Bhakti yoga means to practice connecting the God, and establishing our relationship with, God, through acts of love and service, or devotional service. Basic principle of Bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is that the Absolute Truth is not an impersonal void but rather the Supreme Person. The goal of one who practices Bhakti yoga is to revive that state of pure consciousness.\n"}

He became a member of the Servants of India Society founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale in 1914. In 1922, he founded the \"Bhil Seva Mandal\". Later, he became the general secretary of the \"Harijan Sevak Sangh\" founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 . The \"Bharatiya Adimjati Sevak Sangh\" was founded on 24 October 1948 on his initiative. When Indian constitution was in process, Thakkarbapa visited remotest and most difficult parts of India and conducted probe into the situation of tribal and Harijan people. He added valuable inputs in the process of constitution. Mahatma Gandhi would call him 'Bapa'.\n\nThakkarbapa visited forests in Assam, rural Bengal, drought affected areas of Orissa, Bhil belts in Gujarat and Harijan areas of Saurashtra, Mahar areas of Maharashtra, untouchables in Madras, hilly areas of Chhota Nagpur, desert of Tharparkar, foothills of Himalaya, coastal areas of Travancore with his mission of upliftment of tribal and harijans. He would always travel in third class of railway. Thakkarbapa spent 35 years of his life in service of tribal and harijans.\n\nThakkar Bappa was born on 29 November 1869 in a middle-class family of Bhavnagar in Saurashtra region of Gujarat State India. His father Vithal Das Thakkar named the child Amrit Lal. He received his first schooling for benevolence and service to humanity from his father. He got his L.C.E.

He served also as chief engineer in Sangli State for some time and then was employed in Bombay municipality as an engineer. It was here he saw, for the first time, the miserable conditions of those scavengers who had to dispose of the refuse of the whole town of Bombay. He was shocked to see the filthy colonies where the Sweepers had to live and made a firm resolve to devote the rest of his life to alleviate the lot of these people. He later served in Uganda (Country) railways in East Africa. In 1914, he resigned and took up social work. He became a member of Servants of India Society and advocated the rights of untouchables and tribals.\n\nThe Government of India issued a stamp in his honour in 1969.

Perhaps known best for his participation in battles such as the Battle of the Rosebud against General Crook on June 17, 1876, in the Montana Territory, the Battle of Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876 and what would prove to be his last battle, the Battle of Wolf Mountain on January 8, 1877. Two Moons' defeat in the battle at Wolf mountain by General Nelson A. Miles would inevitably lead to the surrender of his Cheyenne band at Fort Keogh in April, 1877.\n\nAfter the surrender of the Cheyenne band he led in 1877, Two Moons chose to enlist as an Indian Scout for the same General, Nelson A. Miles to whom he had not long since surrendered. As a result of Two Moons' pleasant personality, the friendliness that he showed towards the whites as well as his ability to get along with the military, General Miles appointed him head Chief of the Cheyenne Northern Reservation. As head Chief, Two Moons would prove to play a crucial role in facilitating the surrender of Chief Little Cow's Cheyenne band to Fort Keogh.\n\nTwo Moons traveled on multiple occasions to Washington, D.C., to discuss and fight for the future of the Northern Cheyenne people and to better the conditions that existed on the reservation. In 1914, Two Moons met with President Woodrow Wilson to discuss these matters.\n\nTwo Moons was one of the models selected for James Fraser's famous Buffalo Nickel.\nTwo Moons died in 1917 at his home in Montana at the age of 70. Two Moons' grave still lies alongside U.S. Route 212, west of Busby, Montana.\n\n"}

She was one of the delegates to the 1977 National Women's Conference, a major U.S. women's conference held in conjunction with the International Women's Year celebrations of the United Nations. In 2012, her name was inscribed on an arch recognizing women who were Native American leaders at the University of Arizona.\n\nVera Brown was born on May 23, 1924 at the Indian Reservation of Camp Verde, Arizona to Mary and Sam Brown, members of the Mojave-Apache. She was the youngest of three siblings. Her father was a miner, working in the United Verde Mine near Jerome, Arizona and the smelters in Clarkdale and Clemenceau. Until she was school age, the family lived in a \"wickiup\" near Clarkdale. She attended the segregated public school in Clarkdale, which allowed whites to attend in the mornings and Hispanics and American Indians to attend afternoon classes and though she was placed in the morning session, she remembered experiencing discrimination and did not speak English. When she was eleven, her father died on April 19, 1935, from silicosis, having worked the mines without any protective respiratory equipment. She was sent to the Valentine Indian School under the American Indian boarding school program and graduated from the Indian High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Though she earned a scholarship to the University of New Mexico, Brown returned to Carkdale to care for her mother because the pension her father earned had ended after one year and her mother was denied social security. \n\nAfter World War II, Brown married Antonio L. Moreno (1924–1968), a veteran and miner, from Clarkdale. The couple originally made their home in Jerome, where their children Anthony Jr. (1948–2009) and Petra (1949–2011) were born. In 1949, they moved to Ajo, where Antonio worked at the Phelps-Dodge smelter. \n\nIn 1967, against her mother's recommendation, Moreno decided to run for a seat on the tribal council of the Yavapai-Apache Nation. After her husband's death in 1968, Moreno remarried with Henry Starr. She was successful in attaining a seat in 1969 and served for six years, before becoming the first woman to serve as the Tribal Chair in 1975. After serving two-years as Tribal Chair, the 1977 election was fraught with factionalism, causing a contested election, a court battle, and finally a new vote. Starr did not win her re-election bid as Chair. \n\nStarr joined the North American Indian Women's Association (NAIWA), an organization formed to foster inter-tribal betterment for Native Americans. In 1977, she attended the National Women's Conference, which was held in conjunction with the United Nations' International Women's Year celebrations. As one of Arizona's four Native American delegates, of specific interest to her were the anti-discrimination resolution passed by the women which addressed minority rights, including the removal of American Indian children from their homes and tribes, as well as the discussion of the failure of Arizona to pass Medicaid legislation to provide health care to low-income families.\n\nThough defeated in her bid for re-election to the chair, Starr continued to serve on the council, being returned in 1978 as a council member. In 1981, she was elected as treasurer of the tribe and held that post until her election as vice chair of the tribe in 1982. She returned as vice chair in 1983. Issues on which she focused during her time on the council were those that would improve the lives of tribe members. She advocated for improved housing, health care initiatives, and protection of water rights.\n\nStarr died on March 4, 1985 in Cottonwood, Arizona at the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Hospital. Posthumously, her name was inscribed in 2011 on the Native American Women of Arizona Arch on the University of Arizona campus, after having been selected to represent their tribe by the Yavapai-Apache Nation.\n\n"}

{"id": "2826982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2826982", "title": "Winthrop Ames", "text": "Winthrop Ames\n\nWinthrop Ames (November 25, 1870 – November 3, 1937) was an American theatre director and producer, playwright and screenwriter.\n\nFor three decades at the beginning of the 20th century, Ames was an important force on Broadway, whose repertoire included directing and producing Shakespeare and classic plays, new plays, and revivals of Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy operas.\n\nAmes was born in North Easton, Massachusetts to Cathrine Hobart and Oakes Angier Ames, members of a wealthy manufacturing family. Ames studied art and architecture at Harvard University. He worked in the publishing business before turning to a career in the theatre. In 1911, Ames married Lucy (Fuller) Cabot in London, and the couple had two daughters named Catherine and Joan.\n\nIn 1904, Ames toured Europe to study the management techniques of sixty opera and theatre companies. Upon his return to America, he became manager of Boston's Castle Square Theatre. In 1908, he was appointed as the managing director of the New Theatre, at Central Park West and 62nd Street in New York. In November 1909, the theatre opened officially to the public with an opulent production of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" starring Julia Marlowe and E. H. Sothern. The New Theatre was the largest playhouse in New York City at that time, and Ames began to mount ambitious productions, ranging from Shakespeare and other classics to modern works. The theatre was a financial failure and closed after only two seasons.\n\nIn 1912, bucking the tide of Broadway commercialism, Ames used his own money to build the Little Theatre at 240 West 44th Street with the express idea of putting on experimental dramas and to give an opportunity to new playwrights. This theatre had 300 seats and was, at the time, the smallest legitimate theatre in New York. One of the plays he presented in October of the first year of operation was \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", which he billed as the \"First play written entirely for the enjoyment of children.\" Ames wrote the play under the pseudonym \"Jessie Graham White\" from the stories of the Brothers Grimm. The play received favorable reviews. He also built the Booth Theatre on West 45th Street in 1913 and managed both the Little Theatre and the Booth until 1930.\n\nAmes's most notable Broadway productions included an adaptation of \"Prunella\" (1913), \"The Philanderer\" (1913), \"A Pair of Silk Stockings\" (1914), and \"Pierrot the Prodigal\" (1916). During World War I, Ames organized the Over There Theatre League, which arranged for actors to travel to Europe to entertain troops.\n\nAfter the war, Ames began to direct most of the Broadway shows that he produced, including \"The Betrothal\" (1918), \"The Green Goddess\" (1921), \"The Truth About Blayds\" (1922), \"Will Shakespeare\" (1923), \"Beggar on Horseback\" (1924), \"Minick\" (1924), \"Old English\" (1924), \"White Wings\" (1926), \"Escape\" (1927), \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1928) and \"Mrs. Moonlight\" (1930).\n\nBy the 1920s, after the extraordinary success of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in America at the end of the nineteenth century, the popularity of Gilbert and Sullivan had waned. Ames revived interest in these comic operas with lavish and lively seasons of \"Iolanthe\", \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and \"The Mikado\" from 1926 to 1929. Ames directed the productions himself at the Booth Theatre, which received critical praise. These paved the way for American tours by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the 1930s. \"TIME\" magazine wrote of Ames' production of \"Iolanthe\": \"It is generally agreed that in this entertainment he has done the best job of any producer attempting one of the famous series in our time. The only anxiety now is that he may be distracted before he has revived everyone of the operas in an equally felicitous vein... The show is now accepted as incomparably the finest musical preparation of its type in town, and probably in the world.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ames began leasing his theatres to other producers, and he produced his last Broadway play in 1930. In 1931, as he wound down his business affairs with age and poor health, he sold the Little Theatre building to \"The New York Times\". In 1959, the theatre was converted back to a theatre and was briefly renamed in 1964 as the \"Winthrop Ames Theatre\", and in 1983 it was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. In 1932, Ames left New York to retire to North Easton, but there he helped to found the Cambridge School of Drama. In 1929, he was elected a trustee of Harvard and in 1936 became vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.\n\nIn addition to writing his children's adaptation of \"Snow White\" in 1913, Ames was commissioned by the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation to write the screenplay for their 1916 motion pictures \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Snow White\". He also translated \"The Merchant of Paris\" from the French in 1930 and wrote other plays.\n\nAmes died of pneumonia in 1937 in Boston three weeks before his 67th birthday and was buried in North Easton. Like other influential Broadway theater producers, Ames's likeness was captured in caricature by Alex Gard for the wall of Sardi's, the New York City Theater District restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library.\n\nAmes was inducted, posthumously, into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.\n\n\n"}
