Charged with monitoring quality control, she was paired with a French winemaking team from Domaine Chandon’s parent company, Moet & Chandon, which included veteran enologist and winemaker, Edmond Maudiere. Cast in the role of Maudiere’s protégé, Dyer oversaw a series of winemaking trials aimed at creating a naturally fermented sparkling wine based on both Old and New world styles and techniques, including France’s Methode Champenoise. At the time, only a half dozen sparkling wine producers existed in the United States, among them Korbel, Kornell and Schramsberg. The effort resulted in California’s first sparkling wine made from Pinot Meunier, a black grape typically used in Champagne for additional depth and maturity. A separate effort led by Dyer resulted in a still wine also made from the Pinot Meunier varietal.\n\nOver the course of her 24-year tenure at Domaine Chandon, Dyer rose up through the ranks of the Yountville, Calif.-based winery, ultimately becoming vice president and principal winemaker. In this capacity, she oversaw all winemaking at the 400,000-case winery and also worked with its parent company in France. In 1986, Dyer helped found Domaine Chandon’s sister winery in Australia’s Yarra Valley, and also oversaw export products for the company’s winery facility in Argentina. It was during this period that Dyer joined forces with other winemakers and grape growers in calling for the creation of Geographic Indications and Appellations of Origin for America’s wine growing regions, including the Napa Valley AVA.\n\nWhile at Domaine Chandon, Dyer and husband Bill, a respected winemaker in his own right, planted a cabernet sauvignon vineyard in the Diamond Mountain District AVA of the Napa Valley, and began making earthy Bordeaux-style wines from the hillside estate. In 2000, she left Domaine Chandon to devote more time to Dyer Vineyard, which produces 400 cases of wine per year. The estate-grown cabernet is known for its minerality and deep berry flavors, characteristics associated with wines produced in the higher elevation Diamond Mountain AVA. In the 2004 book by Matt Kramer, \"New California Wine: Understanding the Napa Valley, Sonoma, Central Coast and Beyond\", the \"Wine Spectator\" columnist credited the Dyers with creating “great cabernets” produced in “minute” but “superb quality.”\n\nDawnine and Bill Dyer have been the winemakers for Sodaro Estate Winery in Napa, CA since its inception. \n\nIn 2005, the Dyers partnered with former America Online Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Barry Schuler and his wife, Tracy Strong Schuler to create a cabernet sauvignon blend, branded Meteor Vineyard, made from grapes grown on the Schuler’s vineyard in the Napa Valley’s Coombsville region. The hilltop vineyard, which previously sold its grapes to acclaimed Napa Valley labels including Dyer, Lail, Favia, Arietta, Etude and Vineyard 29, bottled its first vintage under the Meteor label in 2005, with a release date of February 2008. In the September 2007 issue of Decanter, U.K. wine authority Steven Spurrier commended the Meteor team, including Dyer, for its 2005 vintage after sampling the wine at a recent barrel auction. In an article, he described the blend as having \"smooth, spicy fruit” and \"plush tannins.” Spurrier organized the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 in which French and California wines were tasted side-by-side in the first serious competition between the two countries.\n\nDuring her career, Dyer has served as President of the Napa Valley Vintners Association (NVV), president of Napa Valley Wine Technical Group and was a member of the founding board of Women for WineSense, a national 12-chapter association founded in 1990. Through her work with the NVV, she has become a recognized voice for the importance of Geographic Indications and Appellations of Origin to the Napa Valley and has been invited to speak on the issue in Geneva, Switzerland, Beijing, China, Lima, Peru, and Bordeaux, France. She lectures for the annual Wine Industry Executive program at the University of California at Davis Graduate School of Business and also sits on the board of directors for Frog's Leap Winery. She is also a judge for several professional wine competitions, including the U.S.-based National Women’s Wine Competition.\n\nThe Dyers have been married since 1981. The couple lives full-time on their Diamond Mountain estate. Their wine properties are held by the limited liability company, Dyer Straits Wine Co.\n\n"}

She and her husband Joseph Nāwahī were leaders in the opposition to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and they co-founded \"Ke Aloha Aina\", a Hawaiian language newspaper, which served as an important voice in the resistance to the annexation of Hawaii to the United States. After annexation, she helped established the Democratic Party of Hawaii and became a supporter of the women's suffrage movement.\n\nBorn on September 28, 1854, at Kūkūau, a rural part of Hilo on the island of Hawaii, she was regarded as a \"hapa-pākē\", of half-Native Hawaiian and half-Chinese descent. Her mother Kahaoleʻauʻa was the daughter of a minor Hilo chief, while her father Tong Yee was a Chinese immigrant from Xiangshan County, Guangdong. Her father originally left China to take part in the California Gold Rush but later settled in Hilo in 1850 where he became a successful businessman and co-founded Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation with other Chinese sugar planters from lands leased from King Kamehameha V. Her parents married on June 25, 1851. Her father adopted the surname \"Aʻii\" (based on the Hawaiian pronunciation of his given name) for himself and his children. She and her four sisters: Aʻana, Aʻlai, Aʻoe, and Mihana were known as \"Ka Pua O Kina\" (The Flower of China) and regarded as \"famous beauties.\"\n\nOn February 17, 1881, Emma married politician Joseph Nāwahī, in Hilo, as his second wife. They had three sons: Albert Kahiwahiwa Nāwahī (1881–1904), Alexander Kaʻeʻeokalani Nāwahī (1883–1942) and Joseph Nāwahī, Jr. (1885–1888). Through their sons, they have surviving descendants living to this day. They also adopted a daughter named Emmeline Kaleionamoku \"Kalei\" Nāwahī (1877–1901), who died while attending St. Andrew's Priory School in Honolulu.\nDuring her husband's political career and the couple's residency in Honolulu, Emma became a lady-in-waiting and confidante to Queen Liliʻuokalani.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the monarchy, on January17, 1893, her husband Joseph Nāwahī became the president of Hui Aloha ʻĀina oNa Kane (Hawaiian Patriotic League for Men), a patriotic group founded shortly after the overthrow to oppose annexation and support the deposed queen. Emma joined the corresponding female organization, the Hui Aloha ʻĀina oNa Wahine (Hawaiian Women's Patriotic League), which was under the leadership of Abigail Kuaihelani Campbell as president. She served one of the member of the executive committee of the organization in 1893 and later served as the Secretary of the Hilo Branch of the League.\n\nIn 1893, Emma and the other members of the executive committee of Hui Aloha ʻĀina oNa Wahine submitted a petition to the United States Commissioner James Henderson Blount sent by President Grover Cleveland to investigate the overthrow. The petitions addressed to the government of the United States read:\n\nIn December 1894, a search warrant was served on the Nāwahīs' Kapālama home looking for \"sundry arms and ammunition.\" Although nothing was found, Joseph Nāwahī was arrested for treason and bail was set at 10,000 dollars. He spent nearly three months in jail until being bailed out. \nIn May 1895, Nāwahī and Emma founded \"Ke Aloha Aina\", a weekly anti-annexationist newspaper written in the Hawaiian language to promote Hawaiian independence and opposition to American annexation.\nThe paper ran until 1920.\n\nFollowing his release, Nāwahī's health deteriorated from the tuberculosis he had contracted during his imprisonment. On the recommendation of his doctor to seek a change of climate, they left Hawaii for a trip to San Francisco, California. They left Honolulu aboard the steamer \"Alameda\" on August 20, 1896, along with the families of Edward C. MacFarlane and Hermann A. Widemann, both influential royalists and former cabinet ministers of Liliʻuokalani. On September 14, 1896, Nāwahī died of tuberculosis in San Francisco. According to Silva, his last words were to Emma, apologizing for \"taking her so far from the \"‘äina\" and from her family and friends, to deal with his death alone in a foreign place\". Emma had the remains of her dead husband embalmed and returned to Hawaii for two grand state funerals organized by his supporters, and burial at their home in Hilo.\n\nAfter Nāwahī's death, Emma became an important political leader in her own right, continuing the legacy of her husband. In 1897, Emma and members of both the male and female branches of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures by the residents of the Hawaiian Islands opposing an annexation treaty being discussed on the floors of the United States Senate. These Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by a delegation of Native Hawaiians and was used as evidence of the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by the Newlands Resolution, issued in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.\n\nAfter annexation, Emma helped organize the Democratic Party of Hawaii in 1899 at the time of the formation of the Territory of Hawaii. In the 1910s, she became a supporter of the women's suffrage movement prior to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920.\n\nEmma died on December 28, 1935 and was buried at Homelani Memorial Park in Hilo alongside her husband.\n"}

Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have \"too many words\", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.\n\nThe social networking website Facebook has maintained the real-name system policy for user profiles. According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position \"that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.\" Likewise per this policy, a \"real name\" is defined by \"your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID.\" In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83 million Facebook accounts are fake accounts. As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20. Facebook has asserted that \"authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person.\"\n\nNative Americans have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy. \n\nA number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service. Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a class action lawsuit against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.\n\nIn 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her surname, which is common in Japan, being confused with a Star Wars character of the same name.\n\nThe Dublin branch of the Irish language rights group, Misneach, started a Change.org online petition to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.\n\nIn 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.\n\nIn the Spanish-influenced indigenous Chamoru culture of the Marianas, the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's maiden name as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that \"Names can't have too many words.\" Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.\n\nIn cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that \"Profile names can't have too many periods.\") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being \"Mary Dlg Mafnas\". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.\n\nIn January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being \"false and misleading\". \"Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?\" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to \"Phoo Da Bi\" (IPA: ). After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was \"glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous\". Subsequently \"Phuc Dat\" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.\n\nTamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials. This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.\n\nFacebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or pseudonyms used by the transgender community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake. A user via the anonymous Android and iOS app Secret began reporting \"fake names\" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the stage names of drag queens.\n\nTransgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional. According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, Chris Cox, Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.\n\nSecular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger Raif Badawi in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in Bangladesh or Pakistan.\n\nInternational non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation stated they were \"alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nOnline magazine \"Queerty\" called Facebook's policy \"a frankly creepy overreach of authority\", adding \"There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place.\"\n\nIn an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: \"If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone… FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money.\"\n\nSeattle drag performer Olivia LaGarce started a Change.org online petition titled \"Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!\"\n\nOn December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims. The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their \"special circumstance\" or \"unique situation\" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.\n\nThis measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.\n\n\n\n"}

Her monument sculpted by Rodrigo Arenas stands in Neiva, the capital of the Huila Department in Colombia.\n\nAccording to Spanish chronologists, at the time of conquest, the modern territory of Huila Department was inhabited by many different indigenous peoples. The Yalcón (with nearly 6,000 warriors), the Avirama, the Pinao, the Guanaca, and the Paez lived north of the Magdalena River, with later concentrations around the La Plata River. South of the Magdalena River lived the Andaquí and Timaná and to the east lived the Pijao.\n\nPedro de Añasco was a Spanish conquistador, sent by Sebastián de Belalcázar to found a village in the territory of what is today Timaná, in order to create a trade route through the Magdalena Valley.\n\nDe Añasco called all the indigenous leaders and demanded them to pay him a tribute. A tribe of Yalcón people, commanded by a young man and his mother (\"cacica\" Gaitana) delayed the payment, and De Añasco decided to set an example by ordering her son to be burned alive.\n\nThe execution of Gaitana's son caused outrage among the indigenous tribes, who decided to cooperate with each other to join forces against the Spaniards. Añasco and his men were attacked by surprise. The men were executed and Añasco had his eyes removed and was dragged around the village until he died.\n\nHowever, one of the indigenous leaders, Cacique Matambo, betrayed the organized indigenous forces. Matambo warned the Spaniards about plans against them with the result that the indigenous forces were crushed and the remaining indigenous people were gradually decimated by slavery, smallpox and other European diseases. A few hundred thousand of their descendents are scattered throughout the Colombian southwest as the modern Paez people, Guambiano people, and Pijao people among others.\n\n"}

{"id": "33780062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33780062", "title": "Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam", "text": "Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam\n\nHassan Tehrani Moghaddam () (29 October 1959 – 12 November 2011) was an Iranian military officer in the Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and designer of Iran's ballistic missile project. He was the chief of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He founded Iran's long-range missile program and sought the expertise and blueprint designs from North Korea in order to help develop Iran's missile technology. He designed the Shahab, Ghadr and Sejjil missiles with an operational range of more than 1,000–2,000 kilometres to target Israel. For these reasons he is regarded as the father of Iran's missile program. He was killed on 12 November 2011 in the Bid Kaneh explosion, at a military base belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 25 miles west of Iran's capital, Tehran.\n\nTehrani Moghaddam was born on 29 October 1959 in Tehran. In 1977, he graduated from high school. In 1979, he received a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. In 1981, he received his MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering from K.N. Toosi University of Technology.\n\nMoghaddam took part in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In 1980, he joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and was given special responsibility for information in the northern section of Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. He had important roles in the Iran–Iraq War as follows:\n\nAfter the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), as Iran had only non-native Scud missiles with an operational range limited to 300 kilometers, Moghaddam set up a long-range missile program and designed a number of different missiles. His immediate goal was to develop a ballistic missile program with an operational range of more than 2,000 kilometers that could hugely threaten Israel. Mostafa Izadi, a commander in the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution and close friend of Moghaddam said, \"Since 1984 [Moghaddam] pioneered the IRGC's ground to ground missile system ... the work which has so frightened the world's imperialist powers and the Zionist regime today.\"\n\nAt first, Moghaddam designed missiles that were reverse-engineered from Russian made Scud missiles. He produced the Shahab-1 from the Scud-B, and then developed the Shahab-2 and the Zelzal missiles (Zelzal-1, Zelzal-2, and Zelzal-3). In 1998, from the Scud-C he developed the Shahab-3, which is a medium-range ballistic missile with an operational range of 2,000 kilometers. It was tested between 1998 and 2003 and was added to Iran's military arsenal on 7 July 2003, with an official unveiling by Ayatollah Khamenei on 20 July of the same year. Moghaddam later improved the Shahab-3 and developed a new version of this missile called Ghadr-110, which has a range of 1,800–2,000 kilometers and is also known as the Ghadr-101.\n\nIn 2008, Moghaddam developed and designed with the help of North korea the first range of Iranian solid-fueled ballistic missiles known as the Sejjil. The Sejjil replaced the Shahab liquid-fueled ballistic missiles. According to US Pentagon sources, the missile profile of the Sejjil closely matches those of the Ashura (Ghadr-110) and Samen missiles. The Sejjil launch tests on 13 November 2008 displayed an operational range of 2,000–2,500 kilometers. Subsequent to this Moghaddam was the chief designer of the Shahab, Ghadr, and Sejjil missiles.\n\nSaeed Qasemi, a commander in the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, said that Iran owed its missile program to Moghaddam and stated: \"A major part of [Iran's] progress in the field of missile capability was due to round-the-clock efforts by ... Moghaddam\". Another commander has described Moghaddam as the founder of Iran's ballistic missile systems. Hossein Salami, the deputy head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp, declared about his role: \"Moghaddam was the main architect of the IRGC' missile power and the founder of the deterrent power of our country.\"\n\nThe Bid Kaneh arsenal explosion was a very large explosion that occurred on 12 November 2011 at the missile garrison of Modares. Seventeen members of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed in the incident, among them the father of Iran's missile program. Those who died are known as the \"Shahidan Ghadir\".\n\nAfter the explosion, initial reports indicated that it had happened at a CNG station, but this was later denied. Iranian officials said that the blast at the missile base was an accident, and ruled out any sabotage organized by the United States and its regional allies. The Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution said that the explosion \"had taken place in an missile arms depot when munitions were being moved\". On the Iranian parliament's website, \"icana.ir\", Parviz Soroori, an Iranian MP, was quoted as saying, \"No sabotage was involved in this incident. It has nothing to do with politics\". However, \"Time\" magazine cited a \"western intelligence source\" as saying that Mossad was behind the blast, and other reports, which were attributed to western intelligence services, also mentioned the involvement of Israel's intelligence services. Speaking to \"The Guardian\" on condition of anonymity, an official with close links to the Iranian Government in Iran said that he believed the Bid Kaneh explosion was \"part of the covert war against Iran, led by Israel\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22390673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22390673", "title": "Hellboy: Darkness Calls", "text": "Hellboy: Darkness Calls\n\nHellboy: Darkness Calls is a comic book limited series created by Mike Mignola and published by American company Dark Horse Comics. It starred Hellboy.\n\nParts of the story arc will be adapted for the 2019 \"Hellboy\" reboot, directed by Neil Marshall.\n\nIn \"Darkness Calls\", several plotlines and characters from earlier stories converge.\n\nIn a tomb near Lucca, Italy, Igor Bromhead (last seen in \"\") summons the witch-goddess Hecate to a catacomb using runes written in blood. She demands to see the lizard body with which the devil Astaroth had cursed him and he obliges. Before she can destroy him he surprises her by invoking her secret name, which, ever since her resurrection in \"\", has been that of Ilsa Haupstein, her luckless human host. Bromhead reveals the bones of Haupstein's lover and Hecate's son, the vampire Vladimir Giurescu, from which Bromhead has magically wrung the information which gives him full power over the horrified goddess.\n\nBack in England, three witches meet among standing stones; they have recovered the horns Hellboy broke from his skull during \"\" and carved a bust of him from one of them. Hellboy wakes in the house of Harry Middleton, an old friend of his and of his adoptive father Trevor Bruttenholm. Under the witches' (and the carved horn's) influence, Hellboy decides to go for a walk, but not before accepting a vintage pistol and holster from Middleton as a gift. On his walk into the woods he is followed by a troop of cats and spied upon from the trees by a haggard specter with copper coins for eyes. Hellboy encounters two odd men and a woman who see him and cut short their rendition of the evocative \"Mister Stormalong\" sea shanty, whose monster-hunting folk hero they identify with Hellboy, and whose verses we have been hearing over several pages of captions. They inform Hellboy that they have reached the spot where corrupt 17th-century witchfinder Henry Hood hung three witches, \"their ladies\", who cursed him with torture and undeath (he is the coin-eyed specter we have seen). After hearing the hanging scene reenacted, the trio rush off to find the burial site of the three hanged witches, whose doting animal familiars they reveal themselves to be: while Hellboy finds himself immobilized (by the spell being cast on his horn) they begin to assume the shapes of a frog, a raven and a cat, resurrecting their former mistresses with a potion poured on their gravesite, and promising Hellboy a gathering of witches (both alive and dead) \"like none before in the history of the world\" telling Hellboy: \"They gather for you!!\"\n\nThe three witches with the carved horn thank the night and its associated powers for binding Hellboy and for resurrecting their three dead sister witches, executed by Henry Hood but now flying about a shocked Hellboy. The three greet their dead mistresses happily but Henry Hood bursts upon them transfixing two of them with the blue unearthly fire of his cutlass. It also wounds the half-demon Hellboy, who he attacks for his hellish parentage, leaving Hellboy reluctantly to be rescued by the third witch and her raven familiar who carry Hellboy off amid a flock of undead witches \"to the sabbath at Leeds\" until he shoots her with Harry Middleton's pistol and, dropped, plummets from the sky. He has not escaped, however, as he crashes through the roof of a disused, cobwebbed church and finds it filled with live witches who await him, having summoned him there using his carved horn.\n\nFor a cautious, inquisitive Hellboy, they recount the scene between Bromhead and Hecate, filling in relevant history from \"\" and showing a triumphant Bromhead removing Ilsa Haupstein's wailing corpse from the Iron Maiden in which she had become Hecate, and bricking it into an alcove with Giurescu's still-amorous skeleton, there to wait \"till Doomsday.\" Bromhead had then tried futilely and disastrously to become King of the Witches by drawing down lunar powers beyond his strength. They tell Hellboy that as the son of a human witch and of the demon ruling the witches of Lancashire and Abbotsbury (and East Bromwich, Faversham and Berkswell), they have selected him as their king. Hellboy angrily refuses them, declares himself at war with them, and begins to make his way out of the church. The carved horn shatters. Panic-stricken, the witches cast about for a plan, when Koku, a diminutive servant of Hellboy's old enemy Baba Yaga, appears and conveys his mistress' offer to take Hellboy off their hands if they (who unlike the Baba Yaga still live in the real world) \"offer\" him to her. The witches agree, and Hellboy steps out of the church into the middle of a vast and empty wintry expanse through which an army of armed and fur-clad skeletons approach. Amidst the thicket of impaled lantern skulls in which she keeps her power, we see the Baba Yaga promising to take Hellboy's eye (in return for the one of hers he'd shot out decades before in \"\") and (as the arriving army reports to Hellboy) also his life.\n\nBack in the church, the witches debate who will rule them if not Hecate or Hellboy. The Gruagach of Loch Leane, Hellboy's vengeful fairy nemesis, arrives offering to go fetch a witch they poisoned and cut in pieces, one that they still fear, who should be their queen, and could rescue them from dwindling into nothing, and also \"make the daytime world weep with fear.\" Meanwhile, in the snowy plain \"beyond the thrice-nine lands in the thrice-tenth kingdom\" the Baba Yaga's army attacks Hellboy, who fights for a while and then runs into a wood. Giant wolves rush from the wood to attack the Baba Yaga's soldiers, and a giant white wolf guides Hellboy into the woods to the campfire of his master, the Leshii. Hellboy bores the Leshii who is nonetheless happy to save Hellboy in order to spite the Baba Yaga. Before departing in the form of a giant horned bear, the Leshii warns Hellboy to stay in the woods only for one night. He asks Perun, the Russian storm-god, to destroy the army, which is buried in snow, as Hellboy finds them when, just before daybreak, he is chased from the woods by the Leshii's wolves. Thwarted, the Baba Yaga flies in her mortar and pestle to the castle of Koschei the Deathless, who broods, cobwebbed on his throne, demanding that if he helps her, she must give him the gift of death. She promises to set him free from life in return for Hellboy's head. Meanwhile, Hellboy finds his way through a winter storm to a small house where he resists a brief attack from, and then makes friends with, the house's guardian spirit or Domovoi. The Domovoi tells him that Perun is hiding him from the Baba Yaga and from Koschei using the storm weather, but that Koschei cannot be killed as his soul is inside an egg inside a duck inside a rabbit inside a goat which the Baba Yaga has hidden. Meanwhile, the Baba Yaga finds Perun (who we have just seen as a spear-armed horseman riding above stormclouds) drawing lightning branches with a stick in the mud of a riverbank, a mud-caked and naked old man. Her soldiers dispatch him with arrows as she tells him she will tolerate no other Russian gods than herself.\n\nA bird grieves over Perun's body, meanwhile somewhere in England, blood wells over the lintel of a hilltop church, flowing from two murdered monks. A hole in the floor before the altar leads to an ancient cavern where the Gruagach and two elfin servants approach a well with a giant iron lid. When Gruagach rings on the lid with his hammer, a giant appears who puts on spectacles to read the letter Gruagach hands him - from the giant's masters, the witches of Britain - and then begins to weep at what he must do. He raises the lid and climbs down to get his prisoner for the Gruagach. With Perun dead, meanwhile, the storm outside Hellboy's cottage has failed, and Koschei kicks in the door. The two fight as Koschei explains his intentions and motives, and the Domovoi wails over his broken furniture. Hellboy impales Koschei and beheads him but Koschei merely reattaches his head. At that moment Vasilisa, appearing at the cottage's door, subdues Koschei with light from the skull she received from Baba Yaga in her legend. Hellboy pins Koschei to the floor with his own sword and they run. Kosschei ignores the Domovoi's goading, extricates himself, and takes out an arrow from his pack. Vasilisa explains to Hellboy the story of her magic doll and her time with the Baba Yaga, and shows Hellboy the tunnel back to the real world, before falling to the first of Koschei's arrows, which also pepper Hellboy as Koschei rides on them. Dying, Vasilisa gives Hellboy the wooden comb and blue handkerchief her doll had given her (\"When I was old and grey and dying in my bed,\" she says) and then becomes her doll, still pierced by Koschei's arrow. Hellboy confronts the now-arrived Koschei.\n\nAt Yggdrasil, the world tree, a squirrel, (never identified specifically as Ratatosk) worries aloud that Ragnarok has come with the death of Vasilisa, but one of the Baba Yaga's soldiers shoots him and he dies. The Baba Yaga, Koku, and a figure that seems to be Death watch from their place at the tree's roots. In the distance, Hellboy tosses Vasilisa's comb at Koschei, who tosses it over his shoulder. Where it hits the earth a small forest springs up, its branches lifting Koschei into the sky and growing agonizingly through his chest and limbs. The Baba Yaga insists that there is no longer a place even in the real world to which Hellboy can run, and back in the hilltop church, the giant climbs out of his well carrying a small wooden box containing the dismembered and segmented body of his prisoner. He then climbs tearfully back into the hole, pulling the lid down over him, in order to escape the new and bloody world coming into being. Tugging the box out of the church, Gruagach and his companions tell a small bird (who will next appear in the opening scene of \"\") that it had best tell its mistress to choose sides \"for our new queen is here.\" Elsewhere, the lead fairy from \"\" asks the Dagda, fairy king, how bad it will be and the Dagda answers \"We will not survive it.\" In the Thrice-Tenth Kingdom, Hellboy begins to climb toward the tunnel back to reality; but the Baba Yaga calls for Koschei's soul and begins to breathe her power into its mouth. Up in the branches, Koschei screams as his body bursts with light and fire burning free of the branches. He descends blazing upon Hellboy as the Baba Yaga anticipates using Hellboy's eye to look into Hell and into secret places to learn \"the secret workings of all things.\" As Hellboy crushes Koschei beneath a boulder, the Baba Yaga repeats that Hellboy has no home left in the real world, and through the tunnel we see England's witches flying about their cobwebbed church celebrating the approach of their new queen. She breathes more power into the goat and Koschei bursts up through the stone as a blazing giant, screaming \"DEATH!\"\n\nThe Baba Yaga's ten thousand skull lanterns are going out, all their power breathed into Koschei. Meanwhile, two of Baba Yaga's undead soldiers reminisce about serving under Koschei when alive, and pity his servitude to the witch. Koschei begs Hellboy to accept death, and regrets that he is cursed to keep killing Vasilisa. The Baba Yaga breathes her last spark of life into Koschei who still cannot defeat Hellboy. She considers using the spirit of Rasputin which she had stored in an acorn since the epilogue of \"\", but Koku knocks it from her hand so it falls through the roots of the World Tree into Hell. Defeated, Koschei hurls his sword at and into a departing Hellboy's back, so that he drops Vasilisa's blue handkerchief which becomes a flood to carry Koshchei's body away. Death explains to the Baba Yaga that \"Hellboy is as deathless as Koschei\" and his eye must be given freely, for which Hellboy is not yet ready. Hellboy wanders through the tunnel into the cobwebbed church (now empty), where he silently passes the ghostly figure of Vasilisa, lighting a cigar and reaching back to pull out Koschei's sword. Henry Hood greets him in the churchyard repeating \"Finish it\" before dissolving into dust and two copper coins. Scratched in the rust of Hood's cutlass is the name: IGOR BROMHEAD. Forty-two hours later in Italy, near Lucca, two villagers show Hellboy where Bromhead has been hiding - he has been eating their sheep. Having swallowed the moon, he has bloated into a monstrous giant human worm. He begs Hellboy to kill him, while two witches, flying as birds, urge that he be left to his fate. Hellboy asks if he's ready and then stabs him with Hood's cutlass. Dying, and once again with a fully human body, Bromhead tells Hellboy that he will see him in Hell, and that he sees him there already, seated on a dragon at the head of his army. Meanwhile, the Dagda meets the Gruagach and his friends, who have dragged their new queen's box to the top of a hill. He begs the Gruagach to see reason and one of the Gruagach's two bodies stabs him fatally in the back, before stabbing his own heart in remorse.

This event caused the downfall of the Hyperborean civilization as Hecate, revered by some as a goddess, is cursed into her lamia-like form by Thoth. Regardless, Hecate tells Grey she is still unrepentant at her mission to enlighten and free mankind: insisting that she is beyond human knowledge. Before entering a deep sleep until the last day when Hellboy calls her, Hecate foretells her own death in an and that Grey will find and assist Helboy. Hecate concludes her prophecy before entering her rest by telling Grey: \"Before you are finally allowed to die, you will suffer as few men have ever suffered.

{"id": "40547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40547", "title": "Ian Curtis", "text": "Ian Curtis\n\nIan Kevin Curtis (15 July 1956 – 18 May 1980) was an English singer-songwriter and musician. He was the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division. Joy Division released their debut album, \"Unknown Pleasures\", in 1979 and recorded their follow-up, \"Closer\", in 1980.\n\nCurtis, who suffered from epilepsy and depression, took his own life on 18 May 1980, on the eve of Joy Division's first North American tour and shortly before the release of their second album. His suicide resulted in the band's dissolution and the subsequent formation of New Order. Curtis was known for his bass-baritone voice, dance style, and songwriting typically filled with imagery of desolation, emptiness, and alienation.\n\nCurtis was born on 15 July 1956, at the Memorial Hospital in Stretford, Manchester, and grew up in a working-class household in Macclesfield, Cheshire. He was the first of two children born to Kevin and Doreen Curtis. From an early age, Curtis was a bookish and intelligent child, displaying a particular flair for poetry. He was awarded a scholarship at the age of 11 at Macclesfield's independent King's School. Here, he developed his interests in philosophy, literature, and eminent poets such as Thom Gunn. While at King's School, he was awarded several scholastic awards in recognition of his abilities—particularly at the ages of 15 and 16. The year after Ian had graduated from King's School, the Curtis family purchased a house from a relative, and moved to New Moston.\n\nAs a teenager, Curtis chose to perform social service by visiting the elderly as part of a school programme. While visiting, he and his friends would steal any prescription drugs that they found and later take them together as a group. On one occasion when he was 16, after consuming a large dosage of Largactil he and his friends had stolen, Curtis was discovered unconscious in his bedroom by his father and was taken to hospital to have his stomach pumped. Curtis had held a keen interest in music since the age of 12, and this interest developed greatly in his teenage years, with artists such as Jim Morrison and David Bowie being particular favourites of his, and thus influencing his poetry and art. Curtis could seldom afford to purchase records, leading him to frequently steal them from local shops. By his mid-teens, Curtis had also developed a reputation among his peers as a strong-willed individual, with a keen interest in fashion.\n\nDespite gaining nine O-levels at King's School, and briefly studying A-Levels in History and Divinity at St. John's College, Curtis soon became disenchanted with academic life, and abandoned his studies to commit himself to finding employment. Despite abandoning his studies at St. John's College, Curtis continued to focus on the pursuit of art, literature and music, and would gradually draw lyrical and conceptual inspiration from ever more insidious subjects.\n\nCurtis obtained a job at a record shop in Manchester City Centre, before obtaining more stable employment within the civil service. His employment as a civil servant saw Curtis initially deployed to Cheadle Hulme, where he worked for several months with the Ministry of Defence, before he was offered alternate employment within the Manpower Services Commission in a building at Piccadilly Gardens. He later worked as a civil servant in Woodford, Greater Manchester, although at his request, approximately one year later, Curtis was posted to Macclesfield's Employment Exchange, where he worked as an Assistant Disablement Resettlement Officer.\n\nOn 23 August 1975, Curtis married Deborah Woodruff, to whom he was introduced by a friend, Tony Nuttall. Ian and Deborah initially became friends then began dating in December 1972, when both were 16 years old. Their wedding service was conducted at St Thomas' Church in Henbury, Cheshire. Curtis was 19 and Woodruff 18. They had one child, a daughter named Natalie, born on 16 April 1979. Initially, the couple lived with Ian's grandparents, although shortly after their marriage, the couple moved to a working-class neighbourhood in Chadderton, where they paid a mortgage while working in jobs neither enjoyed. Before long, the couple became disillusioned with life in Oldham, and remortgaged their house before briefly returning to live with Ian's grandparents. Shortly thereafter, in May 1977, the couple moved into their own house in Barton Street, Macclesfield, with one of the rooms of the property becoming colloquially known between the couple as Curtis's \"song-writing room\".\n\nAt a July 1976 Sex Pistols gig at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall, Curtis encountered three childhood school friends named Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Terry Mason. The trio informed Curtis—whom they had seen at earlier punk gigs at The Electric Circus—of their intentions to form a band, and Curtis informed them of his then-recent efforts to do likewise, before proposing himself as both their singer and lyricist. Initially, Mason became the band's drummer, but his rehearsal sessions were largely unproductive, and he briefly became the band's manager. The group then unsuccessfully attempted to recruit several drummers before selecting Stephen Morris in August 1977. The band was later managed by Rob Gretton, who—having already seen Joy Division perform live at local venues such as Rafters—offered to become their manager in 1978.\n\nInitially, the band named themselves \"Warsaw\", from the title of a song on David Bowie's then-recent album \"Low\", but as this name somewhat conflicted with that of a London-based group named \"Warsaw Pakt\", they renamed themselves \"Joy Division\". This moniker was derived from the 1955 novel \"The House of Dolls\", which featured a Nazi concentration camp with a sexual slavery wing called the \"Joy Division\". The cover of the band's first EP depicted a drawing of a Hitler Youth beating a drum and the A-side contained a song, \"Warsaw\", which was a musical retelling of the life of Nazi leader Rudolf Hess.\n\nAfter founding Factory Records with Alan Erasmus, Tony Wilson signed the band to his label following the band's first appearance on the TV music show he hosted, \"So It Goes\", in September 1978. This appearance had been largely prompted by an abusive letter sent to Wilson by Curtis, and saw the band play the song \"Shadowplay\".\n\nWhile performing with Joy Division, Curtis became known for his quiet and awkward demeanour, and a unique dancing style often reminiscent of the epileptic seizures he began experiencing in late 1978. Although predominantly a singer, Curtis also played guitar on a handful of tracks (usually when Sumner was playing synthesizer; \"Incubation\" and a \"Peel session\" version of \"Transmission\" were rare instances when both Sumner and Curtis played guitar). Initially, Curtis played Sumner's Shergold Masquerader, but in September 1979 he acquired his own guitar, a Vox Phantom VI Special (often described incorrectly as a Teardrop or ordinary Phantom model) which had many built-in effects used both live and in studio.\n\nCurtis's widow has claimed that, in October 1979, Curtis began conducting an affair with the Belgian journalist and music promoter Annik Honoré, whom he had first met at a gig held in Brussels that month. Reportedly, despite the fact he had for many years exhibited a somewhat controlling attitude within their relationship (which had included minimising any opportunity for his wife to come into contact with other men), Curtis was consumed with guilt over this affair due to being married, and the father to their baby daughter, but at the same time still yearning to be with Honoré. On one occasion in 1980, Curtis asked Bernard Sumner to make a decision on his behalf as to whether he should remain with his wife or form a deeper relationship with Honoré; Sumner refused. Honoré claimed in a 2010 interview that although she and Curtis had spent extensive periods of time in each other's company, their relationship had been a platonic one.\n\nCurtis' bandmates later recollected that Curtis began to become slightly \"lofty\" and distant from them after he had become acquainted with Honoré, who was demanding of his time and attention. These facts would occasionally invoke pranks directed at himself and Honoré from them. He is also known to have become a vegetarian—likely at Honoré's behest—although he was known to have eaten meat when not in her presence.\n\nCurtis began suffering epileptic fits in late 1978; he was officially diagnosed with the condition on 23 January the following year, with his particular case being described by doctors as so severe, his \"life would [be] ruled to obsolescence by his severe epilepsy\" without the various strong dosages of medications he was prescribed. Having joined the British Epilepsy Association, Curtis was initially open to discuss his condition with anyone who inquired, although he soon became withdrawn, and reluctant to discuss any issue regarding his condition beyond the most mundane and necessary aspects. On each occasion it became apparent a particular prescribed medication failed to control Curtis's seizures, his doctor would prescribe a different anticonvulsant, and his wife noted his being \"full of renewed enthusiasm\" that this particular formulation would help him bring his seizures under control.\n\nThroughout 1979 and 1980, Curtis's condition gradually worsened amid the pressure of performances and touring, with his seizures becoming more frequent and more intense. Following his diagnosis, Curtis continued to drink, smoke, and maintain an irregular sleeping pattern—against the advice given to those suffering from the condition. The medications Curtis was prescribed for his condition produced numerous side effects, including extreme mood swings. This change in personality was also observed by Curtis's wife, family and in-laws, who noted how taciturn he had become in his wife's company. Following the birth of his daughter in April 1979, because of the severity of his medical condition, Ian was seldom able to hold his baby daughter in case he compromised the child's safety.\n\nAt the time of the recording of the band's second album, Curtis's condition was particularly severe, with him enduring a weekly average of two tonic-clonic seizures. On one occasion during these recordings, Curtis's bandmates became concerned when they noted he had been absent from the recording studio for two hours. The band's bassist, Peter Hook, discovered Curtis unconscious on the floor of the studio's toilets, having hurt his head on a sink following a seizure. Despite instances such as this, Hook stated that, largely through ignorance of the condition, he, Sumner and Morris did not know how to help. Nonetheless, Hook was adamant that Curtis never wanted to upset or concern his bandmates, and would \"tell [us] what [we] wanted to hear\" if they expressed any concern as to his condition. In one incident at a concert held before almost 3,000 people at the Rainbow in Finsbury Park in April 1980 when Joy Division appeared alongside the Stranglers, the lighting technicians at this venue—contrary to instructions given to them by Rob Gretton prior to the gig—switched on strobe lights midway through Joy Division's performance, causing Ian Curtis to almost immediately stagger backwards and collapse against Stephen Morris's drum kit in the throes of an evident seizure. He had to be carried offstage to the band's dressing room to recuperate.\n\nWhen Curtis had recovered from this first seizure, he was adamant the band travel to West Hampstead to honour their commitment to perform their second gig of the evening at this location, although some 25 minutes into this second gig, Curtis's \"dancing started to lose its rhythmic sense and change into something else entirely\" before he collapsed to the floor and experienced the most violent seizure he had endured to date.\n\nCurtis's onstage dancing was often reminiscent of the seizures he experienced, and has been termed by some to be his \"epilepsy dance\". Throughout Joy Division's live performances in 1979 and 1980, Curtis collapsed several times while performing and had to be carried off stage. To minimise any possibility of Curtis having epileptic seizures, flashing lights were prohibited at Joy Division gigs; despite these measures, Bernard Sumner later stated that certain percussion effects would cause Curtis to suffer a seizure. In April 1980, Terry Mason was appointed as a minder to ensure Curtis took his prescribed medications, avoided alcohol consumption, and got sufficient sleep.\n\nRegarding the choreography of Curtis's stage performances, Greil Marcus in \"The History of Rock 'n' Roll in Ten Songs\" quotes Jon Savage from \"Melody Maker\": \"Ian's mesmeric style mirrored the ever more frequent epileptic spasms that Deborah Curtis had to cope with at home.\" Marcus remarked that Curtis's performance \"might also have been a matter of intentionally replicating fits, re-enacting them, using them as a form of energy and a form of music.\"\n\nCurtis's final live performance with Joy Division was on 2 May 1980. This performance was at the High Hall of Birmingham University, and included Joy Division's first and only performance of \"Ceremony\", later recorded by New Order and released as their debut single. The final song Curtis performed on stage with Joy Division prior to his death was \"Digital\".\n\nFollowing Curtis's first definite suicide attempt on 6 April 1980, Tony Wilson and his partner, Lindsay—expressing deep concerns as to Joy Division's intense touring schedule being detrimental to Curtis's physical and mental well-being—invited him to recuperate at their cottage in Charlesworth. At this address, he is known to have written several letters to Honoré, proclaiming his love for her as he recuperated from this initial suicide attempt.\n\nBy early 1980, Curtis's marriage to Deborah was floundering, as she had commenced divorce proceedings due to his having failed to cease all contact with Honoré. Curtis had enjoyed solitude, but had never been mentally equipped for living alone. He was having difficulty balancing his family obligations with his musical ambitions, and his health was gradually worsening as a result of his epilepsy, thus increasing his dependency upon others. On the evening prior to his death, Curtis informed Bernard Sumner of his insistence upon seeing his wife that evening. He had also made firm plans to rendezvous with his bandmates at Manchester Airport the following day, prior to their departure for America.\n\nOn the evening of 17 May, Curtis asked his wife to drop her impending divorce proceedings; she replied that he would likely have changed his mind by the following morning, and then—mindful of his previous suicide attempt and also concerned his state of anxiety and frustration may drive Curtis into an epileptic fit—offered to spend the night in his company. Deborah then drove to her parents' home to inform them of her intentions. When Deborah Curtis returned to Barton Street, Ian's demeanour had changed, and he informed his wife of his intentions to spend the night alone, first making her promise not to return to the house before he had taken his scheduled 10 a.m. train to Manchester to rendezvous with his bandmates.\n\nIn the early hours of 18 May 1980, Curtis killed himself by hanging himself in the kitchen of his house at 77 Barton Street, Macclesfield. He was 23 years old. His wife Deborah found his body the next morning; he had used the kitchen's washing line to hang himself after having written a note to her in which he declared his love for her despite having recently conducted an affair with Honoré. In her biography, \"Touching from a Distance\", Deborah Curtis recalls finding her husband's body, and initially thinking that he was still alive before noting the washing line around his neck.\n\nAccording to Tony Wilson, prior to his suicide, Curtis had watched Werner Herzog's 1977 film \"Stroszek\" and listened to Iggy Pop's album \"The Idiot\". His wife recollected that he had taken photographs of their wedding and their baby daughter off the walls, apparently to view as he composed his suicide note.\n\nAt the time of his suicide, Joy Division were on the eve of their debut North American tour, and Deborah Curtis has stated Ian had viewed this upcoming tour with extreme trepidation, not only because of his extreme fear of flying (he had wanted to travel to America by ship), but because he had also expressed deep concerns as to how American audiences would react to his epilepsy. Deborah Curtis has also claimed Ian had confided in her on several occasions that he held no desire to live past his early twenties. He had furthermore expressed to both his wife and Annik Honoré his deep concerns as to his medical condition being likely to kill him in addition to his receiving mockery from the band's audiences, and that this mockery would only increase from the band's impending American audiences on their upcoming tour.\n\nAccording to Lindsay Reade (the wife of the manager of Factory Records), Curtis had informed her shortly before his death of his belief that, with his epilepsy, he could no longer perform live with the band. In addition, he had claimed that with the impending release of \"Closer\", he believed the band had hit an artistic pinnacle. Tony Wilson later said that Curtis likely saw his act of suicide as somewhat altruistic.\n\nIn a 2013 \"The Guardian\" interview, Genesis P-Orridge spoke about being the last person Curtis spoke to before his death.\n\nBassist Peter Hook later reflected on the tragedy of the timing of Curtis's death, just before what might have been a breakthrough to fame. Hook also claimed that, prior to the release of the 2007 documentary film \"Joy Division,\" a specialist in epilepsy had viewed the combination of drugs Curtis had been prescribed for his condition, and expressed concerns about its safety.\n\nCurtis's body was cremated at Macclesfield Crematorium on 23 May; his ashes were later buried at Macclesfield Cemetery. A memorial stone, inscribed with \"Ian Curtis 18 – 5 – 80\" and \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", was placed above his ashes.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"The Guardian\", Stephen Morris expressed regret that nobody had realised during Curtis's life the distress he was in, even though it was evident in his lyrics.\n\nShortly after Curtis's cremation, Sumner, Hook, and Morris—strongly aided by Rob Gretton— formed a new band. Initially calling themselves \"The No Names\" and playing largely instrumental tracks, they soon became \"New Order\". Shortly after Curtis's death, Bernard Sumner inherited the Vox Phantom VI Special guitar Ian Curtis had acquired in September 1979; he used this instrument in several early New Order songs, including the single \"Everything's Gone Green\".\n\nIn 1985, New Order released the instrumental song \"Elegia\", written in memory of Ian Curtis. Label sharing band the Durutti Column released in 1981 their album \"LC\", including the Ian Curtis tribute song \"The Missing Boy\". In 1990, Psychic TV released \"I.C. Water\", a song dedicated to Curtis.\n\nDeborah Curtis has written a biographical account of their marriage, \"Touching from a Distance\", which was first published in 1995. This biography details in part his relationship with Annik Honoré. In 1999, the post-hardcore band Thursday released a song titled \"Ian Curtis\" on their debut album, \"Waiting\".\n\nThe 2002 New Order song \"Here to Stay\" was dedicated to Ian Curtis, Rob Gretton and Martin Hannett. Authors Mick Middles and Lindsay Reade released the book \"Torn Apart: The Life of Ian Curtis\" in 2006. This biography takes a more intimate look at Curtis and includes photographs from personal family albums and excerpts from his letters to Honoré during their relationship. Music journalist Paul Morley wrote \"Joy Division, Piece by Piece, writing about Joy Division 1977–2007\"; it was published in late 2007. The book documents all of his writings and reviews about Joy Division, from their formation until Tony Wilson's death.\n\nThe words \"Ian Curtis Lives\" are written on a wall in Wallace Street, Wellington, New Zealand. The message, which appeared shortly after the singer's death in 1980, is repainted whenever it is painted over. A nearby wall on the same street on 4 January 2005 was originally emblazoned \"Ian Curtis RIP\", later modified to read \"Ian Curtis RIP Walk in Silence\" along with the incorrect dates \"1960–1980\". Both are referred to as \"The Ian Curtis Wall\".\n\nOn 10 September 2009, the wall was painted over by Wellington City Council's anti-graffiti team. The wall was chalked back up on 16 September 2009. The wall was repainted on 17 September 2009, and has been removed and repainted on and off. A new and improved design, with correct dates and the original \"Walk in Silence\", was painted on the wall on 27 February 2013.\n\nIn 2012, Curtis was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover.\n\nCurtis was portrayed by Sean Harris in the 2002 film \"24 Hour Party People\", which dramatised the rise and fall of Factory Records from the 1970s to the 1990s. In 2007, a British Ian Curtis biographical film entitled \"Control\" was released. This film was largely based upon Deborah Curtis's book \"Touching from a Distance\". The film was directed by the Dutch rock photographer and music video director Anton Corbijn, who had previously photographed the band and directed the video for their single \"Atmosphere\". Deborah Curtis and Tony Wilson were executive producers, while Todd Eckert of Clara Flora was the producer. Sam Riley, the lead singer of the band 10,000 Things, portrays Curtis, while Samantha Morton plays his wife, Deborah.\n\n\"Control\" was debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2007, and took three awards at the Directors' Fortnight. \"Control\" portrays Curtis's secondary school romance with Deborah, their marriage, his problems balancing his domestic life with his rise to fame, his struggles with both his major depressive issues and his poorly medicated epilepsy, and his later relationship with Annik Honoré.\nIn 2014, the house in which Curtis committed suicide went on sale. Upon hearing this news, a fan initiated a campaign via Indiegogo to raise funds to purchase the house with intentions to preserve the property as a museum to Ian Curtis and Joy Division. The campaign only raised £2,000 out of the intended final goal £150,000. The money raised was later donated to the Epilepsy Society and MIND charities.\n\nUpon hearing of the failure of this project, an entrepreneur and musician named Hadar Goldman purchased the property; offering to pay a £75,000 compensation fee on top of the requested house price of £125,000 in order to secure the purchase of 77 Barton Street and thus reverse the transacted sale from a private purchaser, which at the time was already in progress. Justifying his decision, Goldman stated he intended the property to act as a Joy Division museum, and as a digital hub to support musicians and other artists worldwide.\n\n"}

{"id": "30363839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30363839", "title": "Joe Arridy", "text": "Joe Arridy\n\nJoe Arridy (; April 29, 1915 – January 6, 1939) was a mentally disabled 23-year-old who was falsely accused of the rape and murder of a 15-year-old schoolgirl in Pueblo, Colorado. He was put to death on January 6, 1939. Arridy was officially pardoned in 2011 (72 years after his death) as evidence proved he was coerced into confession. The evidence was provided by then Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, a former district attorney, after research had shown that Arridy was likely not in Pueblo when the crime happened and had been coerced into confessing.\n\nArridy was born in Pueblo, Colorado, to Henry and Mary Arridy, a family who emigrated from Syria to Pueblo. Arridy was admitted to the State Home and Training School for Mental Defectives in Grand Junction, where he spent most of his life. He was often mistreated and beaten by his peers. He left the institution and moved to the railyard in August 1936.\n\nOn August 26, 1936, Arridy was arrested in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after being caught wandering around the railyards. The arrest threw Arridy in a large ongoing investigation into the rape and murder of a Pueblo schoolgirl. Arridy caught the attention of the sheriff in charge, George Carroll, when Arridy revealed that he had come through Pueblo by way of a train while on the run from Grand Junction, Colorado. Prior to notification by the sheriff in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Pueblo had already arrested Frank Aguilar as the prime suspect when Sheriff George Carroll contacted the sheriff in Pueblo and claimed that Arridy told him several times he had \"been with a man named Frank\" at the crime scene. Joe gave several versions of the murder in multiple confessions-the first was that a club was used in the murder. This later changed when the authorities found an axe at the scene and he later testified in interviews that he used an axe. When the case was finally brought to trial his lawyer did not try to fight the allegations and instead sought reprieve through a plea of insanity. Arridy was convicted even though there was a lack of hard evidence which included the sisters' testimony that Frank Aguilar had been present and not Arridy and the determination he was an imbecile with an IQ score of 46 by three state psychiatrists who agreed that Arridy was \"incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and therefore, would be unable to perform any action with a criminal intent.\"\n\nArridy was known for spending his time on death row playing with a toy train, given to him by prison warden Roy Best, who called Arridy \"the happiest prisoner on death row.\" He was liked by both the prisoners and guards. His execution was commented on by Best: \"He probably didn't even know he was about to die, all he did was happily sit and play with a toy train I had given him.\" He received nine stays of execution while the man who was arrested before him, Frank Aguilar, was executed nearly two years earlier. For his last meal, he requested ice cream. When questioned about his impending execution he showed \"blank bewilderment\" and it was clear that he did not realize the meaning of the gas chamber, telling the warden \"No, no, Joe won't die.\" He was reported to have smiled while being taken to the gas chamber and was only momentarily nervous until the warden grabbed his hand and reassured him.\n\n"}

He was also a political philosopher, editor, welder, motorcycle racer, tax resister, atheist, and libertarian activist. His career included stints on the Republican right and the New Left before embracing free-market anarchism. Later in life, he summed up his role in the economy by remarking \"I am by occupation a free marketer (crafts and ideas, woodworking, welding, and writing).\"\n\nHess was born Carl Hess III in Washington, D.C. and moved to the Philippines as a child. His parents were of German and Spanish ancestry. When his mother discovered his father's marital infidelity, she divorced her wealthy husband and returned (with Karl) to Washington. She refused alimony or child support and took a job as a telephone operator, raising her son in very modest circumstances.\n\nKarl's mother encouraged curiosity and direct learning. She often insisted that Karl figure things out for himself, or increase his knowledge through reading. Karl, believing (as his mother did) that public education was a waste of time, rarely attended school; to evade truancy officers, he registered at every elementary school in town and gradually withdrew from each one, making it impossible for the authorities to know exactly where he was supposed to be. He had developed great reverence for libraries; this became very basic to his personal philosophy, and in his autobiography he wrote: \"Literacy is the basic tool in the workshop of the entire world.\"\n\nAs a young person, Karl played tennis, learned marksmanship, and pursued fencing. Later on he learned gunsmithing. He officially dropped out at 15 and went to work for the Mutual Broadcasting System as a newswriter at the invitation of Walter Compton, a Mutual news commentator who resided in the building where Mrs. Hess operated the switchboard. Hess continued to work in the news media, and by age 18 was assistant city editor of \"The Washington Daily News\"\n\nEarly during the Second World War, Hess enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942, but was discharged when they discovered he had contracted malaria in the Philippines.\n\nHe was later an editor for \"Newsweek\" and \"The Fisherman.\" He worked as a staff writer, and sometimes as a freelancer, for a number of anti-Communist periodicals. In the 1950s he worked for the Champion Papers and Fibre Company. He was dismayed that people in the management portion of the corporate world seemed more interested in personal advancement than in doing good work. At Champion his bosses encouraged him to get involved in conservative politics for the company's benefit. In doing so he met Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and many other prominent Republicans, thus beginning the GOP epoch of his life.\n\nIn his book \"Dear America,\" Hess wrote that he became an atheist because his temporary job as a coroner's assistant when he was 15 left him convinced that people were simply flesh-and-blood beings with no afterlife. Consequently, he stopped attending church (he had been a devout Roman Catholic). Years later, while on leave from Champion and working for the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), he resumed attending church because virtually all of his AEI colleagues did so. His return merely reinforced his atheism; on one Sunday morning, while enduring a service as his young son sat on his lap, Hess became disgusted with himself for exposing his child to an institution he himself had rejected.\n\nHess was the primary author of the Republican Party's 1960 and 1964 platforms. In the lead-up to the 1964 presidential election, Hess worked closely with Barry Goldwater. He came to view Goldwater as a man of sterling character, a conservative holding a number of significant libertarian convictions. Hess worked as a speechwriter, and explored ideology and politics. He was widely considered to be the author of the renowned Goldwater line, \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice; moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue,\" but revealed that he had encountered it in a letter from Lincoln historian Harry Jaffa and later learned it was a paraphrase of a passage from Cicero. He later called this his \"Cold Warrior\" phase.\n\nFollowing the 1964 presidential campaign in which Lyndon Johnson trounced Goldwater, Hess became disillusioned with traditional politics and became more radical. Hess and others on the losing team had found themselves outsiders within the national Republican party because of their support of the controversial Goldwater. Hess felt that he had been purged by the Republicans and he departed from involvement with grand-scale politics altogether.\n\nIn 1965 Hess took up motorcycle riding. His need to occasionally repair his motorcycles led to his interest in welding (which he learned at Bell Vocational School). Welding skills gave him something he could trade upon. Initially, he set up a commercial partnership, with a fellow Bell graduate, doing on-site industrial welding. Eventually, his skill led to an involvement with welded-metal sculpture.\n\nAll of this unfolded around the same time as his divorce from his first wife. Hess hereafter publicly criticized big business, suburban American hypocrisy and the military-industrial complex. Though well beyond college age, Hess joined Students for a Democratic Society, worked with the Black Panther Party and protested the Vietnam War.\n\nAfter his work on the Goldwater campaign, Hess was audited by the Internal Revenue Service, which he believed was in retaliation for his support of the losing candidate. In response, he sent the IRS a copy of the Declaration of Independence with a letter saying that he would never again pay taxes. Hess claimed that the IRS then threatened to put a lien on all of his property and 100% of his future earnings. He was supported financially thereafter by his wife and used barter to keep himself busy.\n\nIn 1968, Richard Nixon was elected president and Barry Goldwater went to Washington as Arizona's junior senator. Hess, despite now being a member of the New Left, had recently written some speeches for Goldwater and resumed their close personal relationship; he had concluded that American men should not be forced into military service and urged Goldwater to submit legislation abolishing conscription. Goldwater replied, \"Well, let's wait and see what Dick Nixon wants to do about that one.\" Hess despised Nixon almost as much as he admired Goldwater and could not tolerate the notion that Goldwater would defer to Nixon. Thus ended one of Hess's closest professional associations, and the situation significantly compromised one of his deepest friendships. (Nixon abolished conscription during his presidency, with Goldwater's support.)\n\nHess began reading American anarchists largely because of the recommendations of his friend Murray Rothbard. Hess said that upon reading the works of Emma Goldman he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the Republican Party would represent, and that Goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of Ayn Rand without any of the \"crazy solipsism that Rand was so fond of.\"\n\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Hess edited \"The Libertarian Forum\" with Rothbard.\n\nHess had come to put his focus on the small scale, on community. He said, \"Society is: people together making culture.\" He deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be \"opposition to central political authority\" and \"concern for people as individuals.\" His rejection of standard American party politics was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said, \"The Democrats or liberals think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody... to tell them how to behave themselves. The Republicans think everybody is lazy...\"\n\nIn 1969 and 1970, Hess joined with others, including Murray Rothbard, Robert LeFevre, Dana Rohrabacher, Samuel Edward Konkin III, and former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) leader Carl Oglesby to speak at two \"left-right\" conferences which brought together activists from both the Old Right and the New Left in what was emerging as a nascent libertarian movement.\n\nAs part of his effort to unite right and left-libertarianism, Hess would join the SDS as well as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), of which he explained, \"We used to have a labor movement in this country, until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned. You could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them. They're destroying the militant black leaders the same way now. If the slaughter continues, before long liberals will be asking, 'What happened to the blacks? Why aren't they militant anymore?'\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Hess joined the Libertarian Party, which was founded in 1971 and served as editor of its newspaper from 1986 to 1990.\n\nHess was an early proponent of the \"back to the land\" movement, and his focus on self-reliance and small communities happened in part by government mandate. According to a \"Libertarian Party News\" obituary, \"When the Internal Revenue Service confiscated all his property and put a 100 percent lien on all of his future earnings, Hess (who had taught himself welding) existed on bartering his work for food and goods.\"\n\nHess's life as a welder put him in rapport with a very large segment of the American population who are manual laborers. He eventually came to the conviction that virtually no one in national politics identified with these people anymore. Hess's revolt against public giantism reflected a distrust toward large-corporate business as well as big government. After Hess had made friends within the New Left and related circles, he began to encounter the young, new-breed appropriate technology enthusiasts (exemplified, by the early 1970s, in the editors and readerships of the \"Whole Earth Catalog\" and \"Mother Earth News\").\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hess became involved in an experiment with several friends and colleagues to bring self-built and -managed technology into the direct service of the economic and social life of the poor, largely African American neighborhood of Adams-Morgan in Washington, D.C.. It was the neighborhood in which Hess had spent his childhood. Afterward, Hess wrote a book entitled \"Community Technology\" which told the story of this experiment and its results. According to Hess, the residents had a vigorous go at participatory democracy, and the neighborhood seemed for a time like a fertile ground for the growth of community identity and capability.\n\nMuch of the technological experimentation Hess and others engaged in there was successful in technical terms (apparatus was built, food raised, solar energy captured, etc.). For instance, Hess wrote: \"In one experiment undertaken by the author and associates, an inner-city basement space, roughly thirty by fifty feet, was sufficient to house plywood tanks in which rainbow trout were produced at a cost of less than a dollar per pound. In a regular production run the total number of fish that can be raised in such a basement area was projected to be five tons per year.\" He taught courses and lectured on Appropriate Technology and Social Change in this period at the Institute for Social Ecology in Vermont. Nonetheless, the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, continuing on what he felt was a path of social deterioration and real-estate gentrification, declined to devote itself to expanding on the technology. Hence, in his view, a needy community got little value from the application of viable technology.\n\nSubsequently, Hess and his wife, Therese, moved to rural Opequon Creek between Martinsburg and Kearneysville, West Virginia, where he set up a welding shop as partial support for his household. He became deeply involved with local affairs there. Hess built an affordable house that relied largely on passive-solar heating, and took an interest in wind power and all forms of solar energy. The house they built was a 2000 sq. ft. sun-warmed, earth-sheltered structure – constructed mostly using their own labor, and at cost of just $10,000 (mid-1970s dollars). They acquired most of the tools needed for the construction, and the appliances needed for a comfortable modern life, second-hand. By the late 1970s, Hess saw solar energy as emblematic of decentralization and nuclear energy as emblematic of central organization.\n\nHess wrote for a survivalist newsletter titled \"Personal Survival (\"P.S.\") Letter,\" which was published from 1977 to 1982. It was first published and edited by Mel Tappan. In the same time period, Hess authored the book \"A Common Sense Strategy for Survivalists\".\n\nHess ran a symbolic campaign for Governor of West Virginia in 1992. When asked by a reporter what his first act would be if elected, he quipped, \"I will demand an immediate recount.\"\n\nIn a Reuters online \"Opinion\" piece, in 2012, New Yorker Maureen Tkacik asserted that Karl Hess was the ideological grandfather of the anti-1% movement – making Hess the direct antecedent of thinkers like Ron Paul and both the Tea Party movement and the Occupy movement. She cites the detailed argument Hess, in his libertarian phase, put forward in his book \"Dear America\" to delineate and decry the extreme concentration of power in the hands of a tiny financial and stock-holding elite. Tkacik quotes passages from Hess's book to offer proof that Hess developed the language of the 1% versus the 99% (the former being those whose role, according to Hess, is demonstrably detrimental to the vast majority of Americans).\n\n\n\"\" is a documentary film which won the Academy Award for best short documentary in 1981, after having previously won a Student Academy Award. Another documentary prominently featuring Hess was \"Anarchism in America\" (1983).\n\n"}

{"id": "1517837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1517837", "title": "Lyman E. Johnson", "text": "Lyman E. Johnson\n\nLyman Eugene Johnson (October 24, 1811 – December 20, 1859) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He broke with Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon during the 1837–38 period when schism divided the early church. Johnson later became a successful pioneer lawyer in Iowa and was one of the town fathers of Keokuk, Iowa.\n\nJohnson was born in Pomfret, Windsor County, Vermont, to John Johnson, and Alice Elsa Johnson. The family moved to Hiram, Ohio, in 1818, where they established the John Johnson Farm, a successful farm.\n\nJohnson died in 1859, drowning in the Mississippi River in a boating accident at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. He had at least five children.\n\nJoseph Smith and Emma Hale Smith moved into the Johnson home on September 12, 1831. Within a month, Johnson was ordained an elder and then a high priest of the Latter Day Saint church. In response to a revelation given on January 25, 1832, Johnson joined Orson Pratt on an evangelizing mission which took them through the northeastern United States. The two were highly successful preachers and brought many converts to Mormonism on this and other subsequent missions.\n\nIn the summer of 1834, Johnson marched with the Zion's Camp expedition which hoped to restore Latter Day Saints in Missouri to their lands in Jackson County. Although the expedition was a failure, many of the veterans of the expedition were soon called to high leadership positions in the church. Among these were Johnson and his brother Luke, who were among the original twelve men called on February 14, 1835, to be \"Special Witnesses\" or apostles in a \"traveling high council\" of the church, later known as the Council or Quorum of the Twelve. The chief duty of the apostles was to preside over missionary activities. Johnson continued to operate as a successful missionary from 1835 to 1837. On September 4, 1834, Johnson was married to Sarah Susan Long.\n\nThe failure of the Kirtland Safety Society, a bank founded by church leaders, led to widespread dissent in 1837. The church held a high council trial on September 3, 1837, which ejected Johnson, his brother Luke, and John F. Boynton from the Quorum of the Twelve. Boynton explained that his difficulties with the church resulted from \"the failure of the bank\" which he had understood \"was instituted by the will and revelations of God, and he had been told that it would never fail\". Despite these difficulties, Johnson and the others temporarily reconciled with church leaders and were restored to their apostleships on September 10, 1837, after which Johnson and his family moved to the Latter Day Saint settlement of Far West, Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, schismatic strife between the loyalist faction and the dissenting faction continued to divide the church in Kirtland. The schismatic strife followed them, but in Far West, the loyalists were able to keep control by excommunicating the leadership of the Missouri church—David Whitmer, John Whitmer, W. W. Phelps—along with Oliver Cowdery, Johnson, and others. In Johnson's case, a list of seven charges were presented to him by the Far West High Council on April 9, 1838, which included the charge of \"saying he would appeal the suit between him & Brother Phineas Young and take it out of the County.\" Johnson replied on April 12 that \"I should not condescend to put my constitutional rights at issue upon so disrespectful a point, as to answer any of those other charges until that is withdrawn & until then shall withdraw myself from your society and fellowship.\"\n\n"}

The brand launched its first all-natural products early in 2016 using ethically-sourced Shea butter from Ghana. Her brand plays a part in her charity work by creating more job opportunities in Shea Butter production. A percentage of sales profit of SHE-Y is donated towards Menaye Charity Organization to help educate less fortunate children.\n\nMenaye founded the Menaye Charity Organization in 2004 contributing towards the welfare of underprivileged children through providing free quality education in Ghana. Donkor has worked tirelessly for over a decade to improve the lives of women and children in her home country Ghana through the Menaye Charity Organization. The Organisation provides free quality basic education and scholarships to rural underprivileged children in Ghana, health care and the developmental of young girls. She is solely responsible for raising funds to support the organization.\n\nThe school was founded on 7 September 2000 in the central region of Ghana. Menaye Donkor adopted the school in 2004 after winning Miss Universe Ghana to help build a better environment for the children as the original school lacked in basic necessities.\n\nThe school is located in Agona Asafo, which is considered one of the most deprived regions of the country, with high poverty and extreme illiteracy rates. Having started with 78 pupils sharing one school block, the school now has over 400 children and three blocks, helping students achieve excellent results in their BECE (pre-secondary school) examinations. The Menaye Charity Organisation funds everything for the school, from the buildings and equipment to the teachers’ salaries, as well as uniforms, books and stationery.\n\nIn September 2012, Menaye was honored and chosen by the Chief and elders, of Agona Asafo in the Central Region of Ghana, to be the ‘Nkosuohemaa’ or ‘Development Queen’ of Agona Asafo. Her official title is Nanahemaa Menaye Afumade Afrakoma I. It signifies her global responsibility to her people and as well as her contributions to society.\n\nIn 2013 she made the list of the 15 Most Influential Africans in Canada, which celebrated individuals who continuously inspire others through great achievements. In 2015, Menaye was honored with the \"Woman of The Year\" award by the Infant Charity Award in Milan. The Infant Charity Award is an organization that recognizes the work of different individuals and associations who support improving the lives of sick children.\n\n"}

Primarily active in print media as both a writer and editor, he also became known to television audiences as a co-host on \"Crossfire\". Kinsley has been a notable participant in the mainstream media's development of online content.\n\nKinsley was born to a Jewish family in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Lillian (Margolis) and George Kinsley, who practiced medicine. He attended the Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, then graduated from Harvard College in 1972. At Harvard, Kinsley served as vice president of the university's daily newspaper, \"The Harvard Crimson\". He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, then returned to Harvard for law school.\n\nWhile still a third-year law student, Kinsley began working at \"The New Republic\". He was allowed to finish his Harvard juris doctor degree through courses at the evening program at The George Washington University Law School.\n\nKinsley's first exposure to a national television audience was as moderator of William Buckley's \"Firing Line.\" In 1979, he became editor of \"The New Republic\" and wrote the magazine's TRB column for most of the 1980s and 1990s. That column was reprinted in a variety of newspaper op-ed pages, including the \"Washington Post,\" and made Kinsley's reputation as a leading political commentator.\n\nKinsley also served as managing editor of \"Washington Monthly\" (in the mid-1970s, while still in school), editor at \"Harper's\" (for a year and a half in the early 1980s), and American editor of \"The Economist\" (a short-term, honorary position).\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, Kinsley appeared on CNN's \"Crossfire\", co-hosting with conservative Pat Buchanan. Representing the liberal position in the televised political debates, Kinsley combined a dry wit with nerdy demeanor and analytical skills.\n\nIn January 1995, Kinsley had a cameo on the first episode of the TV sitcom \"Women of the House\", in which the show's main character, Suzanne Sugarbaker, was a guest on \"Crossfire\". He also appeared in three movies during the 1990s: \"Rising Sun\" (1993), \"Dave\" (1993), and \"The Birdcage\" (1996).\n\nAfter leaving \"Crossfire\" in 1995, Kinsley returned to his editorial roots, relocating to Seattle to become founding editor of Microsoft's online journal, \"Slate\". In 1998 he was considered for the position of editor in chief of \"The New Yorker\", but it was ultimately awarded to David Remnick. In 1999 he was named Editor of the Year by the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" for his work at \"Slate\".\n\nKinsley stepped down from \"Slate\" in 2002, shortly after disclosing that he had Parkinson's disease.\n\nKinsley next moved to the \"Los Angeles Times\" as editorial page editor in April 2004. He maintained his Seattle residence and often worked from there, commuting to Los Angeles on a part-time basis. During his tenure, Kinsley tried to overhaul the paper's editorial page and led an abortive experiment with a Wikitorial, while also receiving criticism from USC professor and feminist advocate Susan Estrich alleging a dearth of editorials written by women. Kinsley announced his departure in September 2005 after a falling out with the publisher.\n\nHe returned to writing a weekly column for \"The Washington Post\" and \"Slate\", and in 2006 he served briefly as American editor of \"The Guardian\". He also became a regular columnist for \"Time\" magazine, but in May 2009 wrote that the magazine had \"dumped\" him.\n\nOn September 9, 2010, Kinsley and MSNBC pundit Joe Scarborough joined the staff of \"Politico\" as the publication's first opinion columnists. On April 29, 2011, Bloomberg L.P. announced that Kinsley had joined the Bloomberg View editorial board. In January 2013, Kinsley re-joined \"The New Republic\" as editor at large. In January 2014, \"Vanity Fair\" announced that Kinsley would become a contributing editor and write a monthly column.\n\nIn 2002 Kinsley married Patty Stonesifer, a longtime top executive at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (As a Microsoft vice president, she had managed the Microsoft news portion of the MSNBC merger, which included \"Slate\".) Stonesifer has two adult children from a previous marriage. She is currently president and CEO of Martha's Table, a non-profit that develops sustainable solutions to poverty.\n\nIn 2002 Kinsley revealed that he had Parkinson's disease, and on July 12, 2006, he underwent deep brain stimulation, a type of surgery designed to reduce its symptoms. According to a humorous postscript to his \"Time\" column anticipating the surgery, the operation went well; Kinsley's first words out of the operating room were \"Well, of course, when you cut taxes, government revenues go up. Why couldn't I see that before?\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20405", "title": "Miles Davis", "text": "Miles Davis\n\nMiles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.\n\nBorn and raised in Illinois, Davis left his studies at the Juilliard School in New York City and made his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the \"Birth of the Cool\" sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album \"'Round About Midnight\". It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish-influenced \"Sketches of Spain\" (1960), and band recordings, such as \"Milestones\" (1958) and \"Kind of Blue\" (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over four million copies in the U.S.\n\nDavis made several line-up changes while recording \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and \"Seven Steps to Heaven\" (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams. After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as \"E.S.P\" (1965) and \"Miles Smiles\" (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul, drummer Al Foster, and guitarist John McLaughlin. This period, beginning with Davis' 1969 studio album \"In a Silent Way\" and concluding with the 1975 concert recording \"Agharta\", was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz. His million-selling 1970 record \"Bitches Brew\" helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with jazz fusion as the decade progressed.\n\nAfter a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and pop sounds on albums such as \"The Man with the Horn\" (1981) and \"Tutu\" (1986). Critics were generally unreceptive but the decade garnered the trumpeter his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which recognized him as \"one of the key figures in the history of jazz.\" \"Rolling Stone\" described him as \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,\" while Gerald Early called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.\n\nMiles Dewey Davis III was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent African-American family in Alton, Illinois, fifteen miles north of St. Louis. He had an older sister, Dorothy Mae (born 1925), and a younger brother, Vernon (born 1929). His mother, Cleota Mae Henry of Arkansas, was a music teacher and violinist, and his father, Miles Dewey Davis Jr., also of Arkansas, was a dentist. They owned a 200-acre estate near Pine Bluff, Arkansas with a profitable pig farm. In Pine Bluff, he and his siblings fished, hunted, and rode horses. In 1927, the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They lived on the second floor of a commercial building behind a dental office in a predominantly white neighborhood. From 1932 to 1934, Davis attended John Robinson Elementary School, an all-black school, then Crispus Attucks, where he performed well in mathematics, music, and sports. At an early age he liked music, especially blues, big bands, and gospel.\n\nIn 1935, Davis received his first trumpet as a gift from John Eubanks, a friend of his father. He took lessons from Elwood Buchanan, a teacher and musician who was a patient of his father. His mother wanted him to play violin instead. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato and encouraged him to use a clear, mid-range tone. Davis said that whenever he started playing with heavy vibrato, Buchanan slapped his knuckles. In later years Davis said, \"I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can't get that sound I can't play anything.\" In 1939, the family moved to 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis. On his thirteenth birthday his father bought him a new trumpet, and Davis began to play in local bands. He took additional trumpet lessons from Joseph Gustat, principal trumpeter of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn 1941, the 15-year-old attended East St. Louis Lincoln High School, where he joined the marching band directed by Buchanan and entered music competitions. Years later, Davis said that if he lost a contest, it was because of racism, but he added that these experiences made him a better musician. When a drummer asked him to play a certain passage of music, and he couldn't do it, he began to learn music theory. \"I went and got everything, every book I could get to learn about theory.\" At Lincoln, Davis met his first girlfriend, Irene Birth (later Cawthon). He had a band that performed at the Elks Club. Part of his earnings paid for his sister's education at Fisk University. Davis befriended trumpeter Clark Terry, who suggested he play without vibrato, and performed with him for several years.\n\nWith encouragement from his teacher and girlfriend, Davis filled a vacant spot in the Rhumboogie Orchestra, also known as the Blue Devils, led by Eddie Randle. He became the band's musical director, which involved hiring musicians and scheduling rehearsal. Years later, Davis considered this job one of the most important of his career. Sonny Stitt tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, which was passing through town, but his mother insisted he finish high school before going on tour. He said later, \"I didn't talk to her for two weeks. And I didn't go with the band either.\" In January 1944, Davis finished high school and graduated in absentia in June. During the next month, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Cheryl.\n\nIn July 1944, Billy Eckstine visited St. Louis with a band that included Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker. Trumpeter Buddy Anderson was too sick to perform, so Davis was invited to join. He played with the band for two weeks at Club Riviera. After playing with these musicians, he was certain he should move to New York City \"where the action was.\" His mother wanted him to go to Fisk University, like his sister, and study piano or violin. Davis had other interests.\n\nIn September 1944, Davis accepted his father's idea of studying at the Institute of Musical Arts, later known as the Juilliard School, in New York City. After passing the audition, he attended classes in music theory, piano, and dictation. But he spent much of his time in clubs looking for his idol, Charlie Parker, despite being advised against doing so by several people, including Coleman Hawkins. After finding Parker, he became one of a cadre of regulars at Minton's and Monroe's in Harlem who held jam sessions every night. The other regulars included J. J. Johnson, Kenny Clarke, Thelonious Monk, Fats Navarro, and Freddie Webster. Davis reunited with Cawthon and their daughter when they moved to New York City. Parker became a roommate.\n\nIn mid-1945, Davis failed to register for the year's autumn term at Juilliard and dropped out after three semesters because he wanted to perform full-time. Years later he criticized Juilliard for concentrating too much on classical European and \"white\" repertoire, but he praised the school for teaching him music theory and improving his trumpet technique.\n\nHe began performing at clubs on 52nd Street with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis. He recorded for the first time on April 24, 1945 when he entered the studio as a sideman for Herbie Fields's band. During the next year, he recorded as a leader for the first time with the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway, one of the few times he accompanied a singer.\n\nIn 1945, he replaced Dizzy Gillespie in Charlie Parker's quintet. On November 26, Davis participated in several recording sessions as part of Parker's group Reboppers that also involved Gillespie and Max Roach, displaying hints of the style he would become known for. In Parker's song \"Now's the Time\", Davis played a solo that anticipated cool jazz. He then joined a big band led by Benny Carter, performing in St. Louis and remaining with the band in California. He again played with Parker and Gillespie. In Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that put him in the hospital for several months. In March 1946, Davis played in studio sessions with Parker and began a collaboration with bassist Charles Mingus that summer. Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second child, Gregory, in East St. Louis before reuniting with Davis in New York City the following year. Davis noted that by this time, \"I was still so much into the music that I was even ignoring Irene.\" He had also turned to alcohol and cocaine.\n\nHe was a member of Billy Eckstine's big band in 1946 and Gillespie's in 1947. He joined a quintet led by Parker that also included Max Roach. Together they performed live with Duke Jordan and Tommy Potter for much of the year, including several studio sessions. In one session that May, Davis wrote the tune \"Cheryl\", named after his daughter. Davis's first session as a leader followed in August 1947, playing as the Miles Davis All Stars that included Parker, pianist John Lewis, and bassist Nelson Boyd; they recorded \"Milestones\", \"Half Nelson\", and \"Sippin' at Bells\". After touring Chicago and Detroit with Parker's quintet, Davis returned to New York City in March 1948 and joined the Jazz at the Philharmonic tour, which included a stop in St. Louis on April 30.\n\nIn August 1948, Davis declined an offer to join Duke Ellington's orchestra as he had entered rehearsals with a nine-piece band with pianist and arranger Gil Evans and baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, taking an active role on what soon became his own project. Evans' Manhattan apartment had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers such as Davis, Roach, Lewis, and Mulligan who were unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumental techniques that dominated bebop. These gatherings led to the formation of the Miles Davis Nonet, which included the unusual additions of French horn and tuba. The intent was to imitate the human voice through carefully arranged compositions and a relaxed, melodic approach to improvisation. In September, the band completed their sole engagement as the opening band for Count Basie at the Royal Roost for two weeks. Davis had to persuade the venue's manager to write the sign \"Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan.\" He prevailed only with the help of Monte Kay, the club's artistic director. Davis returned to Parker's quintet, but relationships within the quintet were growing tense mainly due to Parker's erratic behavior caused by his drug addiction. Early into his time with Parker, Davis abstained from drugs, ate a vegetarian diet, and spoke of the benefits of water and juice. Matters worsened when Davis and Roach objected to the addition of pianist Duke Jordan and preferred to hire Bud Powell. In December 1948 Davis quit, claiming he was not being paid.\n\nHis departure began a period when he worked mainly as a freelancer and sideman. His nonet remained active until the end of 1949. After signing a contract with Capitol Records, they recorded sessions in January and April 1949, which sold little but influenced the \"cool\" or \"west coast\" style of jazz. The line-up changed throughout the year and included the additions of tuba player Bill Barber, alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, who had been preferred to Sonny Stitt as his style was considered too bop-oriented, pianist Al Haig, trombone players Mike Zwerin with Kai Winding, French horn players Junior Collins with Sandy Siegelstein and Gunther Schuller, and bassists Al McKibbon and Joe Shulman. One track featured singer Kenny Hagood. The presence of white musicians in the group angered some black players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, yet Davis rebuffed their criticisms. Recording sessions with the nonet for Capitol Records continued until April 1950; much of it remained unreleased until the issue of \"Birth of the Cool\" (1957), its name given to the cool jazz movement that had developed and the musical direction the group had taken.\n\nIn May 1949, Davis performed with the Tadd Dameron Quintet with Kenny Clarke and James Moody at the Paris International Jazz Festival. On his first trip abroad Davis took a strong liking for Paris and its cultural environment, where he felt black jazz musicians and people of color in general were better respected than in America. The trip, he said, \"changed the way I looked at things forever.\" He began an affair with singer and actress Juliette Gréco that lasted for several years.\n\nAfter returning from Paris in mid-1949, he became depressed and found little work, which included a short engagement with Powell in October and guest spots in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit until January 1950. He was falling behind in hotel rent and attempts were made to repossess his car. His heroin use became an expensive addiction, and Davis, yet to reach 24 years old, \"lost my sense of discipline, lost my sense of control over my life, and started to drift.\" In August 1950, during a family trip to East St. Louis and Chicago in an attempt to improve their fortunes, Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second son, Miles IV. Davis befriended boxer Johnny Bratton and began his interest in the sport. Davis left Cawthon and his three children in New York City in the hands of a friend, jazz singer Betty Carter. He remained grateful to her for the rest of his life. He toured with Eckstine and Billie Holiday and was arrested for heroin possession in Los Angeles. The story was reported in \"DownBeat\" magazine, which caused a further reduction in work, though he was acquitted weeks later.\n\nIn January 1951, Davis's fortunes improved when he signed a one-year contract with Prestige Records after owner Bob Weinstock became a fan of the nonet. Davis chose Lewis, trombonist Bennie Green, bassist Percy Heath, saxophonist Sonny Rollins, and drummer Roy Haynes; they recorded what became part of \"Miles Davis and Horns\" (1956). Davis was hired for other studio dates in March, June, and September 1951 and started transcribing scores for record labels to fund his heroin addiction. During the next month, he recorded his second session for Prestige as band leader. The material was released on \"The New Sounds\" (1951), \"Dig\" (1956), and \"Conception\" (1956).\n\nDavis supported his heroin habit by playing music and by living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes, and receiving money from friends. By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a \"Down Beat\" interview with Cab Calloway, whom he never forgave as it brought him \"all pain and suffering.\" He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months. Though he continued to use heroin, he met Roach and Mingus in September 1953 on their way to Los Angeles and joined their band, but the trip caused problems. He returned to his father's home, \"determined to kick my habit...that was the only thing on my mind.\" He locked himself inside the guest house \"for about seven or eight days\" until he had gone through withdrawal. After the ordeal, he \"sat down and started thinking about how I was going to get my life back together.\"\n\nDavis lived in Detroit for about six months, avoiding New York City where it was easy to get drugs. Though he used heroin, he was still able to perform locally with Elvin Jones and Tommy Flanagan as part of Billy Mitchell's house band at the Blue Bird club. He was also \"pimping a little.\" A widely related story, attributed to Richard \"Prophet\" Jennings, was that Davis stumbled into Baker's Keyboard Lounge out of the rain, carrying his trumpet in a paper bag under his coat. He walked to the bandstand, interrupted Roach and Clifford Brown in the middle of performing \"Sweet Georgia Brown\", and played \"My Funny Valentine\" before leaving. Davis was supposedly embarrassed into getting clean by this incident. He disputed this account, stating that Roach had invited him to play and that his decision to quit heroin was unrelated to the incident. He said he was inspired to quit by his idol, boxer Sugar Ray Robinson.\n\nIn February 1954 Davis returned to New York City, feeling good \"for the first time in a long time,\" mentally and physically stronger, and joined a gym. He informed Weinstock and management at Blue Note Records that he was ready to record with a quintet, which he was granted. He considered the resulting albums \"Miles Davis Quartet\" (1954) and \"Miles Davis Volume 2\" (1956) \"very important\" because he felt his performances were particularly strong. He was paid roughly $750 (US$ in dollars) for each album and refused to give away his publishing rights.\n\nDavis abandoned the bebop style and turned to the music of pianist Ahmad Jamal, whose approach and use of space influenced him. When he returned to the studio in June 1955 to record \"Miles Davis Quartet\", he wanted a pianist like Jamal and picked Red Garland. \"Blue Haze\" (1956), \"Bags' Groove\" (1957), \"Walkin'\" (1957), and \"Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants\" (1959) were recorded after his recovery from heroin addiction. They documented the evolution of his sound with the Harmon mute, also known as a wah-wah mute, placed close to the microphone, and the use of more spacious and relaxed phrasing. He assumed a central role in hard bop, which was slower than bebop, less radical in harmony and melody, and often used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues. A few critics consider \"Walkin' \" (1957) the album that created the hard bop genre.\n\nDavis gained a reputation for being cold, distant—and easily angered. He wrote that in 1954 Sugar Ray Robinson \"was the most important thing in my life besides music\" and adopted Robinson's \"arrogant attitude.\" He showed contempt for critics and the press. There were well-publicized confrontations with the public and with other musicians. An argument with Thelonious Monk during the recording of \"Bags' Groove\" was reported. In mid-1954, Davis reunited with Gréco for the first time since 1949 after she arrived in New York City for film prospects. The two had been in occasional contact since he left Paris. Though he was too busy to move to Spain with her, they \"remained lovers for many years.\n\nDavis had an operation to remove polyps from his larynx in October 1955. The doctors told him to remain silent after the operation—but he got into an argument that permanently damaged his vocal cords and gave him a raspy voice for the rest of his life. He was called the \"prince of darkness,” adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.\n\nIn July 1955, Davis's fortunes improved considerably when he was invited to the second annual Newport Jazz Festival on July 17, with a line-up of Monk, Heath, drummer Connie Kay, and horn players Zoot Sims and Gerry Mulligan. He convinced organizer George Wein that he should be on the bill, and Wein agreed. The performance was praised by critics and increased his popularity among affluent white audiences. He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 \"Down Beat\" magazine Readers' Poll.\n\nGeorge Avakian of Columbia Records saw Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance (US$ in dollars) and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.\n\nAt the request of Avakian, he formed the Miles Davis Quintet for a performance at Café Bohemia. The quintet consisted of Davis on trumpet, Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on double bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Rollins was replaced by John Coltrane, completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige: \"Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet\" (1957), \"Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet\" (1958), \"Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet\" (1959), and \"Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet\" (1961). Each album helped establish Davis's quintet as one of the best.\n\nThe style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the Great American Songbook and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on \"'Round About Midnight\", Davis's first album for Columbia.\n\nIn 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the Modern Jazz Quartet and French and German musicians. In Paris he reunited with Greco for the first time since 1949. He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine. At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and Art Taylor.\n\nIn November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the soundtrack to \"Ascenseur pour l'échafaud\" directed by Louis Malle (1958). Consisting of French session musicians Barney Wilen, Pierre Michelot, and René Urtreger, and American drummer Kenny Clarke, the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.\n\nAfter returning to New York City, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on \"Milestones\" (1958), an album that demonstrated Davis's interest in modal jazz. A performance by Les Ballets Africains drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords. In this form of ballet music, the kalimba was played for a long periods on a single chord, weaving in and out of consonance and dissonance.\n\nBy May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer Jimmy Cobb, and Red Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on \"Sid's Ahead\" for the album \"Milestones\". He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired Bill Evans, a young, white pianist with a background in classical music. Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. Wynton Kelly, his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans's delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on \"Jazz Track\" (1958).\n\nBy early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring with his quintet and wished to pursue new projects. During a two-week residency in Chicago in March, the 30-year-old Davis told journalists of his intention to retire at its conclusion and revealed offers he had received to become a teacher at Harvard University and a musical director at a record label. Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward. Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to \"Music for Brass\" (1957), an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by Gunther Schuller featuring Davis as a guest soloist.\n\nDavis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962. \"Miles Ahead\" (1957) showcased Davis playing a flugelhorn and a rendition \"The Maids of Cadiz\" by Léo Delibes, the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music. \"Porgy and Bess\" (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin's opera. \"Sketches of Spain\" (1960) contained music by composers Joaquín Rodrigo and Manuel de Falla and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn't handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US. Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity. The pair's final album was \"Quiet Nights\" (1962), a collection of bossa nova songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer Teo Macero and refused to speak to him for more than two years. Davis noted later that \"my best friend is Gil Evans\"; their work was included in the boxed set \"\" (1996), which won a Grammy Award for Best Historical Album and Best Album Notes in 1997.\n\nIn March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album, \"Kind of Blue\" (1959). He named the album for its mood. He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans's piano style. Both Davis and Evans were familiar with George Russell's ideas about modal jazz. But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, \"Freddie Freeloader.” The sextet had played \"So What\" and \"All Blues\" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.\n\nReleased in August 1959, \"Kind of Blue\" was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics. It remains the best selling jazz album of all time. In October 2008, the album reached 4× platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over four million copies in the US alone. In 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution that honored it as a national treasure.\n\nDuring the success of \"Kind of Blue\", Davis found himself involved with the law. On August 25, 1959, during a recording session at the Birdland nightclub in New York City for the US Armed Services, he took a break outside the club. As he was escorting a blonde-haired woman to a taxi, policeman Gerald Kilduff told him to \"move on.\" Davis said that he was working at the club, and he refused to move. Kilduff arrested him and grabbed him as he tried to protect himself. Witnesses said the policeman punched Davis in the stomach with a nightstick without provocation. Two detectives held the crowd back, while a third approached Davis from behind and beat him in the head. Davis was taken to jail, charged for assaulting an officer, then taken to the hospital where he received five stitches. He was released on a $525 bail (US$ in dollars). By January 1960, he was acquitted of disorderly conduct and third-degree assault. He later stated the incident \"changed my whole life and whole attitude again, made me feel bitter and cynical again when I was starting to feel good about the things that had changed in this country.\"\n\nDavis and his sextet toured to support \"Kind of Blue\". He persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his quartet, though he returned for some tracks on Davis's album \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" (1961). Its front cover shows a photograph of his wife, Frances Taylor, after Davis demanded that Columbia depict black women on his album covers. In early 1958, Davis began a relationship with Frances Taylor, a dancer he had met five years earlier in Los Angeles. They married on December 21, 1960. The relationship involved numerous incidents of Davis' domestic violence towards Taylor. He later wrote, \"Every time I hit her, I felt bad because a lot of it really wasn't her fault but had to do with me being temperamental and jealous.\" One reason for his behavior was that in 1963 he had increased his use of alcohol and cocaine to reduce joint pain caused by sickle cell anemia. He hallucinated, \"looking for this imaginary person\" in his house while wielding a kitchen knife. About a week after the photograph for the album \"E.S.P.\" (1965) was taken, Taylor left him for the last time. They remained separated until their divorce in February 1968.\n\nIn December 1962, Davis, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and Rollins played together for the last time as the first three wanted to leave and play as a trio. Rollins left to join them soon after, leaving Davis to pay over $25,000 (US$ in dollars) to cancel upcoming gigs and quickly assemble a new group. Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist George Coleman, bassist Ron Carter, pianist Victor Feldman, and drummer Frank Butler. By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by pianist Herbie Hancock and 17-year-old drummer Tony Williams who made Davis \"excited all over again.\" With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became \"Seven Steps to Heaven\" (1963) and recorded the live albums \"Miles Davis in Europe\" (1964), \"My Funny Valentine\" (1965), and \"Four & More\" (1966). The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis's previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.\n\nIn 1964, Coleman was replaced by saxophonist Sam Rivers until Davis persuaded Wayne Shorter to leave Art Blakey. This quintet lasted through 1968. Shorter became the group's principal composer, and the album \"E.S.P.\" (1965) was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album, \"Miles in Berlin\" (1965).\n\nDavis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year. He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed. After his third month in the hospital, he discharged himself due to boredom and went home. He returned to the hospital in August after a fall required the insertion of a plastic hip joint. In November 1965, he had recovered enough to return to performing with his quintet, which included gigs at the Plugged Nickel in Chicago. Teo Macero returned as his engineer and record producer after their rift over \"Quiet Nights\" had healed.\nIn January 1966, Davis spent three months in the hospital due to a liver infection. When he resumed touring, he performed more at colleges because he had grown tired of the typical jazz venues. Columbia president Clive Davis noted that in 1966 his sales had declined to around 40,000–50,000 per album, compared to as many as 100,000 per release a few years before. Matters were not helped by the press reporting his apparent financial troubles and imminent demise. After his appearance at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, he returned to the studio with his quintet for a series of productive sessions. He started a relationship with actress Cicely Tyson, who helped him reduce his alcohol consumption.\n\nMaterial from the 1966–1968 sessions was released on \"Miles Smiles\" (1966), \"Sorcerer\" (1967), \"Nefertiti\" (1967), \"Miles in the Sky\" (1968), and \"Filles de Kilimanjaro\" (1968). The quintet's approach to the new music became known as \"time no changes\"—which referred to Davis's decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists' melodies. Through \"Nefertiti\" the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.\n\n\"Miles in the Sky\" and \"Filles de Kilimanjaro\"—which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks—pointed the way to the fusion phase of Davis's career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of \"Filles de Kilimanjaro\" was recorded, bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea had replaced Carter and Hancock. Davis soon took over the compositional duties of his sidemen.\n\nIn September 1968, Davis married 23-year-old model and songwriter Betty Mabry. The marriage ended in divorce the following year, but Mabry, a familiar face in the New York City counterculture, helped introduce Davis to popular rock, soul, and funk musicians. Jazz critic Leonard Feather visited Davis's apartment and was shocked to find him listening to albums by The Byrds, Aretha Franklin, and Dionne Warwick. He also liked James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, and Sly and the Family Stone.\n\n\"In a Silent Way\" (1969) was recorded in a single studio session on February 18, 1969, with Shorter, Hancock, Holland, and Williams alongside keyboardists Chick Corea and Josef Zawinul and guitarist John McLaughlin. The album contains two side-long tracks that Macero pieced together from different takes recorded at the session resembling elements of a classical sonata form. When the album was released in July 1969, some critics accused him of \"selling out\" to the rock and roll audience. Nevertheless, it reached number 134 on the US \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, his first album since \"My Funny Valentine\" to reach the chart. \"In a Silent Way\" was his entry into jazz fusion. The touring band of 1969–1970—with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette—never completed a studio recording together, and became known as Davis's \"lost quintet\".\n\nIn October 1969, Davis was shot at five times while in his car with one of his two lovers, Marguerite Eskridge. The incident left him with a graze and Eskridge unharmed.\n\nFor the double album \"Bitches Brew\" (1970), he hired Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and Bennie Maupin. The album contained long compositions, some over twenty minutes, that were never played in the studio but were constructed from several takes by Macero and Davis. Other studio techniques included splicing, multitrack recording, and tape loops. \"Bitches Brew\" peaked at No. 35 on the \"Billboard\" Album chart. In 1976 it was certified gold for selling over 500,000 records. By 2003, it had sold one million copies.\nIn March 1970, Davis began to perform as the opening act for various rock acts, allowing Columbia to market \"Bitches Brew\" to a larger audience. He so offended by Clive Davis's suggestion to perform at the Fillmore East that he threatened to switch record labels, but he reconsidered and shared a bill with the Steve Miller Band and Neil Young with Crazy Horse on March 6 and 7. Biographer Paul Tingen wrote, \"Miles's newcomer status in this environment\" led to \"mixed audience reactions, often having to play for dramatically reduced fees, and enduring the 'sell-out' accusations from the jazz world,\" as well as being \"...attacked by sections of the black press for supposedly genuflecting to white culture.\" The 1970 tours included the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival on August 29 when he performed to an estimated 600,000 people, the largest of his career. Plans to record with Hendrix ended after the guitarist's death; his funeral was the last that Davis attended. Several live albums with a transitional sextet/septet including Corea, DeJohnette, Holland, Moreira, saxophonist Steve Grossman, and keyboardist Keith Jarrett were recorded during this period, including \"Miles Davis at Fillmore\" (1970) and \"\" (1973).\nBy 1971, Davis had signed a contract with Columbia that paid him $100,000 a year (US$ in dollars) for three years in addition to royalties. He recorded the soundtrack for the 1970 documentary film about heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson, containing two long pieces of 25 and 26 minutes in length with Hancock, McLaughlin, Sonny Sharrock, and Billy Cobham. He was committed to making music for African-Americans who liked more commercial, pop, groove-oriented music. By November 1971, DeJohnette and Moreira had been replaced in the touring ensemble by drummer Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler and percussionists James Mtume and Don Alias. \"Live-Evil\" (1971) was released in the same month. Showcasing former Stevie Wonder touring bassist Michael Henderson, who replaced Holland in the autumn of 1970, the album demonstrated that Davis's ensemble had transformed into a funk-oriented group while retaining the exploratory imperative of \"Bitches Brew\".\n\nIn 1972, composer-arranger Paul Buckmaster introduced Davis to the music of German avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, leading to a period of creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote, \"The effect of Davis' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long ... Davis' own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally.\" His recordings and performances during this period were described as \"space music\" by fans, Feather, and Buckmaster, who described it as \"a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music.\" The studio album \"On the Corner\" (1972) blended the influence of Stockhausen and Buckmaster with funk elements. Davis invited Buckmaster to New York City to oversee the writing and recording of the album with Macero. The album reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" jazz chart but peaked at No. 156 on the more heterogeneous Top 200 Albums chart. \"On the Corner\" elicited a favorable review from Ralph J. Gleason of \"Rolling Stone\", but Davis felt that Columbia marketed it to the wrong audience. \"The music was meant to be heard by young black people, but they just treated it like any other jazz album and advertised it that way, pushed it on the jazz radio stations. Young black kids don't listen to those stations; they listen to R&B stations and some rock stations.\" In October 1972, he broke his ankles in a car crash. He took painkillers and cocaine to cope with the pain. Looking back at his career after the incident, he wrote, \"Everything started to blur.\"\nAfter recording \"On the Corner\", he assembled a group with Henderson, Mtume, Carlos Garnett, guitarist Reggie Lucas, organist Lonnie Liston Smith, tabla player Badal Roy, sitarist Khalil Balakrishna, and drummer Al Foster. Only Smith was a jazz instrumentalist; consequently, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of solos. This group was recorded live for \"In Concert\" (1973), but Davis found it unsatisfactory, leading him to drop the tabla and sitar and play keyboards. He also added guitarist Pete Cosey. The compilation studio album \"Big Fun\" (1974) contains four long improvisations recorded between 1969 and 1972.\n\nStudio activity in the 1970s culminated in sessions throughout 1973 and 1974 for \"Get Up with It\" (1974), a compilation that included four long pieces (comprising over ninety minutes of new music) alongside four shorter recordings from 1970 and 1972. The album contained \"He Loved Him Madly\", a thirty-minute tribute to the recently deceased Duke Ellington that presaged later developments in ambient music. In the United States, it performed comparably to \"On the Corner\", reaching number 8 on the jazz chart and number 141 on the pop chart. He then concentrated on live performance with a series of concerts that Columbia released on the double live albums \"Agharta\" (1975), \"Pangaea\" (1976), and \"Dark Magus\" (1977). The first two are recordings of two sets from February 1, 1975 in Osaka, by which time Davis was troubled by pneumonia, osteoarthritis, sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, and stomach ulcers; he relied on alcohol, codeine, and morphine to get through the engagements. His shows were routinely panned by critics who mentioned his habit of performing with his back to the audience. Cosey later asserted that \"the band really advanced after the Japanese tour\", but Davis was again hospitalized, for his ulcers and a hernia, during a tour of the US while opening for Herbie Hancock. Hancock had eclipsed his former employer from a commercial standpoint with \"Head Hunters\" (1973) and \"Thrust\" (1974), two albums that were marketed to pop audiences in the aftermath of the \"On the Corner\" farrago and peaked at number 13 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart.\n\nAfter appearances at the 1975 Newport Jazz Festival in July and the Schaefer Music Festival in New York City on September 5, Davis dropped out of music.\n\nIn his autobiography, Davis wrote frankly about his life during his hiatus from music. He called his Upper West Side brownstone a wreck and chronicled his heavy use of alcohol and cocaine, in addition to his sexual encounters with many women. In December 1975, he had regained enough strength to undergo a much needed hip replacement operation. In March 1976, \"Rolling Stone\" reported rumors of his imminent demise, citing his health problems during the previous tour. In December 1976, Columbia was reluctant to renew his contract and pay his usual large advances. But after his lawyer started negotiating with United Artists, Columbia matched their offer, establishing the Miles Davis Fund to pay him regularly. Pianist Vladimir Horowitz was the only other musician with Columbia that had a similar status.\n\nIn 1978, Julie Coryell interviewed Davis. Concerned about his health, she had him stay with a friend in Norwalk, Connecticut. Davis asked Coryell's husband, fusion guitarist Larry Coryell, to participate in sessions with keyboardists Masabumi Kikuchi and George Pavlis, bassist T. M. Stevens, and drummer Al Foster. Davis played the arranged piece uptempo, abandoned his trumpet for the organ, and had Macero record the session without the band's knowledge. After Coryell declined a spot in a band that Davis was beginning to put together, Davis returned to his reclusive lifestyle in New York City. Soon after, Eskridge had Davis jailed for failing to pay child support to their son, which cost him $10,000 (US$ in dollars) for release on bail. A recording session that involved Buckmaster and Gil Evans was halted, with Evans leaving after failing to receive the payment he was promised. In August 1978, Davis hired a new manager, Mark Rothbaum, who had worked with him since 1972. Despite the dearth of new material, Davis placed in the Top 10 trumpeter poll of \"Down Beat\" magazine in 1979.\nBy 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress Cicely Tyson, with whom he overcame his cocaine addiction and regained his enthusiasm for music. The two married on November 26, 1981, in a ceremony at Bill Cosby's home in Massachusetts that was officiated by politician and civil rights activist Andrew Young. The marriage ended in a divorce that was finalized in 1989.\n\nIn October 1979, his contract with Columbia was up for negotiation. Label president Clive Davis was replaced by George Butler, who had visited Davis several times during the previous two years to encourage him to return to the studio. To help his situation, Davis had Buckmaster come over to collaborate on new music. After arriving, Buckmaster organized an intervention for Davis, who was living in squalor among cockroach infestations, in the dark with his curtains always closed. His sister Dorothy cleaned his house with help from Buckmaster, Tyson, and neighbor Chaka Khan. Davis later thanked Buckmaster for helping him.\n\nDavis hadn't played the trumpet much for three years and found it difficult to reclaim his embouchure. His first studio appearance since his hiatus took place on May 1, 1980. A day later, Davis was hospitalized due to a leg infection. He recorded \"The Man with the Horn\" (1981) from June 1980 to May 1981 with Macero producing. A large band was abandoned in favor of a combo with saxophonist Bill Evans (not to be confused with pianist Bill Evans) and bassist Marcus Miller. Both would collaborate with him during the next decade.\n\n\"The Man with the Horn\" received a poor critical reception despite selling well. In June 1981, Davis returned to the stage for the first time since 1975 in a ten-minute guest solo as part of Mel Lewis's band at the Village Vanguard. This was followed by appearances with a new band, a four-night run at Kix in Boston, and two shows at Avery Fisher Hall on July 5 as part of the Kool Jazz Festival. Recordings from a mixture of dates from 1981, including the Kix and Avery Fisher Hall gigs, were released on \"We Want Miles\" (1982), which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist.\nIn January 1982, while Tyson was working in Africa, Davis \"went a little wild\" with alcohol, and suffered a stroke that temporarily paralyzed his right hand. Tyson returned home and cared for him. After three months of treatment with a Chinese acupuncturist, he was able to play the trumpet again. He listened to his doctor's warnings and gave up alcohol and drugs. He credited Tyson with helping his recovery, which involved exercise, piano playing, and visits to spas. She encouraged him to draw, which he pursued for the rest of his life.\n\nDavis resumed touring in May 1982 with a line-up that included French percussionist Mino Cinelu and guitarist John Scofield, with whom he worked closely on the album \"Star People\" (1983). In mid-1983, he worked on the tracks for \"Decoy\", an album mixing soul music and electronica that was released in 1984. He brought in producer, composer, and keyboardist Robert Irving III, who had collaborated with him on \"The Man with the Horn\". With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and Darryl Jones, he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the Léonie Sonning Music Prize. Trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg had written a contemporary classical piece titled \"Aura\" for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album, \"Aura\" (1989). Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.\n\nIn May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records that required him to give up his publishing rights. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis publicly dismissed his more recent fusion recordings as not being \"'true' jazz.\" Davis shrugged off the comment, calling Marsalis \"a nice young man, only confused.\" Marsalis appeared unannounced onstage during Davis's performance at the inaugural Vancouver International Jazz Festival in 1986. Marsalis whispered into Davis' ear that \"someone\" had told him to do so. Davis responded by ordering him off the stage. Davis had become increasingly irritated at Columbia's delay in releasing \"Aura\". The breaking point appears to have come when a producer at Columbia asked him to call Marsalis and wish him a happy birthday. The tour in 1985 included a performance in London in July in which Davis performed on stage for five hours. Jazz critic John Fordham concluded, \"The leader is clearly enjoying himself.\" By 1985, Davis was diabetic and required daily injections of insulin.\n\nHe released \"You're Under Arrest\", his final album for Columbia, in September 1985. It included cover versions of two pop songs: \"Time After Time\" by Cyndi Lauper and \"Human Nature\" sung by Michael Jackson. He considered releasing an album of pop songs, and he recorded dozens of them, but the idea was rejected. He said that many of today's jazz standards had been pop songs in Broadway theater and that he was simply updating the standards repertoire.\n\nDavis collaborated with a number of figures from the British post-punk and new wave movements during this period, including Scritti Politti. At the invitation of producer Bill Laswell, he recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd.'s \"Album\", according to John Lydon in the liner notes of their \"Plastic Box\" box set. In Lydon's words, however, \"Strangely enough, we didn't use [his contributions].\" According to Lydon in the \"Plastic Box\" notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon's singing voice to his trumpet sound during these sessions.\n\nAfter taking part in the recording of the 1985 protest song \"Sun City\" as a member of Artists United Against Apartheid, Davis appeared on the instrumental \"Don't Stop Me Now\" by Toto for their album \"Fahrenheit\" (1986). For his next studio album, he intended to collaborate with Prince, but the project was dropped. Instead, he worked with Marcus Miller. The result, \"Tutu\" (1986), was the first time he used modern studio tools such as programmed synthesizers, sampling, and drum loops. Released in September 1986, its front cover is a portrait of Davis by Irving Penn. The album was called the modern counterpart of \"Sketches of Spain\". In 1987, he won a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist.\n\nIn 1988, Davis had a small part as a street musician in the Christmas comedy film \"Scrooged\" starring Bill Murray. He also collaborated with Zucchero Fornaciari in a version of \"Dune Mosse\" (\"Blue's\"), published in 2004 in \"Zu & Co.\" of the Italian bluesman. In November 1988, he was inducted into the Knights of Malta at a ceremony at the Alhambra Palace in Spain (hence the \"Sir\" title on his gravestone). Later that month, Davis cut his European tour short after he collapsed and fainted after a two-hour show in Madrid and flew home. Rumors of his health were made public after the American magazine \"Star\", in its February 21, 1989 edition, published that Davis had contracted AIDS, prompting his manager Peter Shukat to issue a statement the following day to deny the claim. Shukat revealed Davis had been in the hospital for a mild case of pneumonia and the removal of a benign polyp on his vocal cords and was resting comfortably in preparation for his 1989 tours. Davis later blamed one of his former wives or girlfriends for starting the rumor and decided against taking legal action. He was interviewed on \"60 Minutes\" by Harry Reasoner. In October 1989, he received a Grande Medaille de Vermeil from Paris mayor Jacques Chirac. In 1990, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film \"Dingo\" as a jazz musician.\nDavis followed \"Tutu\" with \"Amandla\" (1989) and soundtracks to four films: \"Street Smart\", \"Siesta\", \"The Hot Spot\", and \"Dingo.\" His last albums were released posthumously: the hip hop-influenced \"Doo-Bop\" (1992) and \"Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux\" (1993), a collaboration with Quincy Jones from the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival where, for the first time in three decades, he performed songs from \"Miles Ahead\", \"Porgy and Bess\", and \"Sketches of Spain\".\n\nOn July 8, 1991, Davis returned to performing material from his past at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival with a band and orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones. The set consisted of arrangements from his albums recorded with Gil Evans. The show was followed by a concert billed as \"Miles and Friends\" at the Grande halle de la Villette in Paris two days later, with guest performances by musicians from throughout his career, including John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul. In Paris, he was awarded the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. After returning to America, he stopped in New York City to record material for \"Doo-Bop\", then returned to California to play at the Hollywood Bowl on August 25, his final live performance.\n\nIn early September 1991, Davis checked into St. John's Hospital near his home in Santa Monica, California, for routine tests. Doctors suggested he have a tracheal tube implanted to relieve his breathing after repeated bouts of bronchial pneumonia. Their suggestion provoked an outburst from Davis that led to an intracerebral hemorrhage followed by a coma. After several days on life support, his machine was turned off and he died on September 28, 1991. He was 65 years old. His death was attributed to the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. According to Troupe, Davis was taking azidothymidine (AZT), a type of antiretroviral drug used for the treatment of HIV and AIDS, during his treatments in hospital. A funeral service was held on October 5, 1991, at St. Peter's Church in New York City that was attended by around 500 friends, family members, and musical acquaintances, with many fans standing in the rain. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, with one of his trumpets, near the site of his idol, Duke Ellington.\n\nLate in his life, from the \"electric period\" onwards, Davis repeatedly explained his reasons for not wishing to perform his earlier works, such as \"Birth of the Cool\" or \"Kind of Blue\". In his view, remaining stylistically static was the wrong option. He commented: So What' or \"Kind of Blue\", they were done in that era, the right hour, the right day, and it happened. It's over ... What I used to play with Bill Evans, all those different modes, and substitute chords, we had the energy then and we liked it. But I have no feel for it anymore, it's more like warmed-over turkey.\" When Shirley Horn insisted in 1990 that Miles reconsider playing the ballads and modal tunes of his \"Kind of Blue\" period, he demurred. \"Nah, it hurts my lip\", was the reason he gave.\n\nOther musicians regretted Davis' change of style. Bill Evans, who played piano on \"Kind of Blue\", said, \"I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master, but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience. It happens more and more these days that unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music.\"\n\nMiles Davis is considered one of the most innovative, influential, and respected figures in the history of music. \"The Guardian\" described him as \"a pioneer of 20th-century music, leading many of the key developments in the world of jazz.\" He has been called \"one of the great innovators in jazz\", and had the titles the Prince of Darkness and the Picasso of Jazz bestowed upon him. \"The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll\" said, \"Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style—in attitude and fashion—as well as music.\"\n\nWilliam Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote, \"To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period ... It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasn't there to push it forward.\" Music writer Christopher Smith wrote,\n\nMiles Davis's artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary. ... Miles' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.\n\nHis approach, owing largely to the African-American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.\n\n\"Kind of Blue\" remains the best-selling jazz album of all time. On November 5, 2009, U.S. Representative John Conyers of Michigan sponsored a measure in the United States House of Representatives to commemorate the album on its 50th anniversary. The measure also affirms jazz as a national treasure and \"encourages the United States government to preserve and advance the art form of jazz music.\" It passed with a vote of 409–0 on December 15, 2009. The trumpet Davis used on the recording is displayed on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was donated to the school by Arthur \"Buddy\" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program.\n\nIn 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Davis an Honorary Doctorate for his contributions to music. Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.\n\nIn 2001 a two-hour documentary film by Mike Dibb entitled \"The Miles Davis Story\" won an International Emmy Award for arts documentary of the year.\n\n\"Miles Ahead\" was a 2015 American music film directed by Don Cheadle, co-written by Cheadle with Steven Baigelman, Stephen J. Rivele, and Christopher Wilkinson, which interprets the life and compositions of Davis. It premiered at the New York Film Festival in October 2015.

He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nBishop was born in Kaysville, Utah and graduated from Davis High School. He served as a Mormon missionary in Germany from 1970 until 1972. Bishop received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 1974. He taught civics classes at Brigham City's Box Elder High School from 1974 to 1980; he next taught German in Ogden, Utah at Ben Lomond High School; then he returned to teaching government and history classes at Box Elder High School until his retirement from teaching in 2002. While a teacher at Box Elder, Bishop partnered with the Close Up Foundation to help students participate in Close Up's Washington, D.C. based civic education programs. He remains actively involved in the program and works to ensure that Utah students have the opportunity to visit Washington, D.C.\n\nBishop was a member of the Utah House of Representatives from 1978 to 1994. He was House Majority Leader and later served as Speaker of the House from 1992 until 1994. After his retirement from the state legislature, Bishop returned to Box Elder High School and taught advanced placement courses while chairing the history department.\n\nIn 1997 he was elected chairman of the Utah Republican Party, and served for two terms in this position. He has also worked as a legislative lobbyist in Washington.\n\nIn 2002, Bishop returned to politics when he ran for the Republican nomination in the 1st District. 22-year incumbent Jim Hansen had recently announced his retirement. At the state Republican convention, he finished first in the seven-candidate field and went on to face State Representative Kevin Garn in a primary. He defeated Garn in that primary with 59.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring him of being the next congressman from this heavily Republican district. As expected, he won the general election with 61% of the vote. He has won re-election in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 with even larger margins. In 2014, he was reelected with 64% of the vote.\n\nAs a teacher, he has made education related issues a top priority. He is a strong advocate for increased local control of schools. He opposes No Child Left Behind and supports school vouchers. He was also a co-sponsor of a proposed amendment to guarantee a balanced federal budget.\n\nIn 2016 Bishop led drafting efforts on legislation to address the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis.\n\nIn the 2016 election cycle, 92.6% of contributions to Bishop's political campaign came from outside Utah, the highest out-of-state percentage of any member of the House, with much of the contributions coming from the energy and agribusiness sectors, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn 2010 Bishop introduced to the House an amendment to the United States Constitution, known as the \"repeal amendment,\" which would allow a majority vote of the states to overturn any act of the United States Congress.\n\nBishop supports repeal of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, saying it has been \"hijacked\" to control land and block economic development, and that he \"would love to invalidate\" the law. Bishop is among those most critical of the Antiquities Act. Bishop opposed the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument and supports repealing or shrinking the designation. Bishop supports transferring federal public lands to the states.\n\nIn February 2011, Bishop introduced a budget amendment that would have defunded the National Landscape Conservation System, which manages 27 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land, including the National Monument, National Conservation Area, National Wilderness Preservation, National Wild and Scenic Rivers, National Scenic Trail, National Historic Trail systems and other systems. After coming under fire for introducing this amendment, Bishop withdrew it.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act. The bill would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 to subject national monument declarations by the President to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). At present, the President of the United States can unilaterally designate areas of federally-owned land as a national monument, whereas national parks and other areas are required to be enacted into law by the United States Congress. Bishop argued that \"the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President\". He claims his new bill would ensure \"that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input\".\n\n\n\nBishop is the co-founder of the Western State Coalition, a states' rights organization. \n\nBishop is married to Jeralynn Hansen, a former Miss Peach Queen for Brigham City, Utah, where he and his family currently live.

Angers (1894–1965) and the former Anna Mae Nunez (1898–1988). He graduated from Catholic High School, then known as St. Peter's College of New Iberia. In 1940, he procured his Bachelor of Arts in journalism from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. During World War II, Angers was a major of the United States Army's 24th Infantry Regiment. He received the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Bronze Star. In 1949, Angers graduated from the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nAngers began his journalism career upon graduation from LSU with his hometown \"Abbeville Progress\". After wartime service, he became in 1945 the advertising manager in 1945 of the \"Weekly Iberian\" and \"New Iberia Enterprise\". With his father and brother, Allen, Angers co-owned Angers Real Estate Agency in New Iberia from 1946–1950, when he became the publisher of the \"Franklin Banner-Tribune\" in Franklin, the seat of St. Mary Parish. During his fifteen years at the \"Banner-Tribune\", the newspaper converted from a weekly to a daily publication and won 150 state and national press association awards.\n\nIn 1961, Angers co-founded with future Lafayette Mayor Kenny Bowen, Angers, Bowen and Associates public relations firm in Lafayette He sold his interest to Bowen in 1962. From 1966-1968, Angers was an editorial writer and columnist of the \"Lafayette Daily Advertiser\". He founded the \"Jeanerette Weekly Journal\" (1964–1965), \"Southwest Louisiana Capitalist\" (1963), and \"Acadiana Profile\" magazine (1968), which covers twenty-two South Louisiana parishes and is the longest-running still active magazine in Louisiana history. Assisted by his wife, Angers edited and published \"Acadiana Profile\" from 1968–1985, when his son took over the management. His last job in journalism was again at the \"Lafayette Daily Advertiser\" as business editor from 1985 until his death in 1988. From 1967-1968, Angers was also editor of \"Latin American Report\" magazine in New Orleans. He founded the Acadian News Agency, which syndicated his public affairs editorials to Louisiana newspapers. Trent Angers acquired the news agency in 1970.\n\nAngers was a Democrat until 1960, when he joined the Republican Party. In 1964, he supported Charlton Lyons for governor of Louisiana. In July 1964, Angers was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in San Francisco, where he supported U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater for U.S. President. He lashed out at the then all Democratic congressional delegation from Louisiana, calling the members \"so-called southern conservatives who are really liberals ... that vote with Lyndon Johnson on nearly all major bills.\"\n\nAngers himself ran as the GOP candidate for the Lafayette-based 3rd Congressional District seat against the 16-year incumbent, Democrat Edwin E. Willis of St. Martinville. Angers received 31,806 votes (37.7 percent) to Willis's 52,532 (62.3 percent) and lost every parish in the district. In Lafayette Parish, Angers procured 49.6 percent of the vote and outpolled Goldwater there by 3.5 percentage points. Three other Republicans ran unsuccessfully for U.S. House seats from Louisiana that year: future Governor David C. Treen in the New Orleans suburbs, Floyd O. Crawford (1907–1995) of Baton Rouge, and William Stewart Walker of Winnfield, who opposed the conservative Democrat Speedy O. Long in the since defunct 8th congressional district. Angers was a Louisiana delegate to the 1968 Republican National Convention which nominated the Nixon-Agnew ticket. In 1974, however, Angers left the GOP and re-registered as an Independent.\n\nAngers was a member of the St. Pius Catholic Church of Lafayette. He was also affiliated with a plethora of organizations, including the journalism society, Sigma Delta Chi, the New Iberia Port Commission, the Kiwanis Club, and Rotary International, which endowed a Paul Harris Fellowship in his name. He was the founding secretary of the trade association, the Louisiana Intracoastal Seaway Association, and a charter member of the Caribbean-American Freedom League, which worked with Cuban exile groups in unsuccessful efforts to overthrow the communist government of Fidel Castro. Angers was a director of the Louisiana Sugar Cane Festival and the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana. He was a former president of the Louisiana Press Association, the Franklin Chamber of Commerce (1953), and the Louisiana Jaycees (1949). He founded and served as the first president of the interest groups, The International Relations Association of Acadiana (TIRAA) and the International Good Neighbor Council. He founded these organizations to promote trade, tourism and goodwil in French and Spanish-speaking countries. Angers received the George Washington Honor Medal from Freedoms Foundation in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Prior to his death, he received the Lafayette Board of Realtors \"Good News Award\". He was also cited by the Louisiana Farm Bureau for its \"Special Press Award\" for his lifetime endeavors of promoting and writing about agriculture.\n\nOn August 31, 1941, Angers married the former Geraldine Isabelle Beaulieu (born March 3, 1921) of Jeanerette in Iberia Parish, the daughter of Gerald A. Beaulieu, Sr., and the former Laurice Hebert. The couple had seven sons and a daughter: Robert Gerald, Judith Ann, Trent Michael, Stephen Brion, Winston Thomas, John Matthew, Glen Williams, and Jefferson Mark. Another son died at birth.\nAngers died at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. His passing came three months after the death of his mother.

{"id": "261268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261268", "title": "Rufus King", "text": "Rufus King\n\nRufus King (March 24, 1755April 29, 1827) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat. He was a delegate for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress and the Philadelphia Convention and was one of the signers of the United States Constitution in 1787. After formation of the new Congress he represented New York in the United States Senate. He emerged as a leading member of the Federalist Party, serving as the party's last presidential nominee in the 1816 presidential election.\n\nThe son of a prosperous Massachusetts merchant, King studied law before volunteering for the militia in the American Revolutionary War. He won election to the Massachusetts General Court in 1783 and to the Congress of the Confederation the following year. At the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, he emerged as a leading nationalist, calling for increased powers for the federal government. After the convention, King returned to Massachusetts, where he used his influence to help win ratification of the new Constitution. At the urging of Alexander Hamilton, he then abandoned his law practice and moved to New York City.\n\nHe won election to represent New York in the United States Senate in 1789, remaining in office until 1796. That year, he accepted President George Washington's appointment to the position of Minister to Britain. Though King aligned with Hamilton's Federalists, Democratic-Republican President Thomas Jefferson retained his services after Jefferson's victory in the 1800 presidential election. King served as the Federalist vice presidential candidate in the 1804 and 1808 elections, running on an unsuccessful ticket with Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. Though most Federalists supported Democratic-Republican DeWitt Clinton in the 1812 presidential election, King, without the support of his party, won little votes of those Federalists who were unwilling to support Clinton's candidacy. In 1813, he returned to the Senate and remained in office until 1825.\n\nKing was the informal de facto Federalist nominee for president in 1816, losing in a landslide to James Monroe. The Federalist Party became defunct at the national level after 1816, and King was the last presidential nominee the party fielded. Nonetheless, King was able to remain in the Senate until 1825, making him the last Federalist senator, due to a split in the New York Democratic-Republican Party. After that King accepted John Quincy Adams's appointment to serve another term as ambassador to Britain, but ill health forced King to retire from public life, and he died in 1827. King had five children who lived to adulthood, and he has numerous notable descendants.\n\nHe was born on March 24, 1755, at Scarborough, which was then a part of Massachusetts but is now in the state of Maine. He was a son of Isabella (Bragdon) and Richard King, a prosperous farmer-merchant, \"lumberman, and sea captain\" who had settled at Dunstan Landing in Scarborough, near Portland, Maine, and had made a modest fortune by 1755, the year Rufus was born. His financial success aroused the jealousy of his neighbors, and when the Stamp Act 1765 was imposed, and rioting became almost respectable, a mob ransacked his house and destroyed most of the furniture. Nobody was punished, and the next year the mob burned down his barn. This statement proves true as John Adams once referenced this moment discussing limitations of the \"mob\" for the Constitutional Convention writing a letter to his wife Abigail and describing the scene as:\n\nI am engaged in a famous Cause: The Cause of King, of Scarborough vs. a Mob, that broke into his House, and rifled his Papers, and terrifyed him, his Wife, Children and Servants in the Night. The Terror, and Distress, the Distraction and Horror of this Family cannot be described by Words or painted upon Canvass. It is enough to move a Statue, to melt an Heart of Stone, to read the Story... It was not surprising that Richard King became a loyalist. All of his sons, however, became patriots in the American War of Independence.\n\nKing attended Dummer Academy (now The Governor's Academy) at the age of twelve, located in South Byfield, MA. Later on he attended Harvard College, where he graduated in 1777. He began to read law under Theophilus Parsons, but his studies were interrupted in 1778 when King volunteered for militia duty in the American Revolutionary War. Appointed a major, he served as an aide to General Sullivan\n\nAfter the campaign, King returned to his apprenticeship under Parsons. He was admitted to the bar in 1780 and began a legal practice in Newburyport, Massachusetts. King was first elected to the Massachusetts General Court in 1783, and returned there each year until 1785. Massachusetts sent him to the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787. He was one of the youngest at the conference.\n\nIn 1787, King was sent to the Constitutional Convention held at Philadelphia. King held a significant position at the convention. Despite his youthful stature, \"he numbered among the most capable orators\". Along with James Madison, \"he became a leading figure in the nationalist causus\". Furthermore, he attended every session. King's \"views underwent a startling transformation during the debates\" originally changing a mindset supporting Articles of Confederation and utterly throwing out the idea that it could be sustained. King's major involvements included serving on the Committee on \"Postponed Matters\" and the \"Committee of Style and Arrangement.\" Although he came to the convention unconvinced that major changes should be made in the Articles of Confederation, his views underwent a startling transformation during the debates. He worked with Chairman William Samuel Johnson, James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, and Alexander Hamilton on the Committee of Style and Arrangement to prepare a final draft of the United States Constitution. King is one of the more prominent delegates namely because of playing \"a major role in the laborious crafting of the fundamental governing character. The constitution was signed on September 17, only needing to be ratified by each of the subsequent states. After signing the Constitution, he returned home and went to work to get the Constitution ratified and unsuccessfully position himself to be named to the U.S. Senate. The ratification passed by the narrow margin of 187–168 votes. With the ratification passed, Massachusetts \"became the sixth state to ratify [the] constitution in early February 1788. Rufus is indirectly responsible for the passing of this ratification seeing that his \"learned, informative, and persuasive speeches\" were able to convince a \"popular, vain merchant and prince-turned-politicians to abandon his anti-federalism and approve the new organic law\".\n\nAfter his early political experiences during the constitutional convention, King decided to switch his vocational calling by \"[abandoning] his law practice [in 1788], [and] moved from the Bay State to Gotham, and entered the New York political forum\". At Hamilton's urging, he moved to New York City, and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1789. Shortly afterwards he was elected as Senator from New York and reelected in 1795. In 1795, King helped Hamilton defend the controversial Jay Treaty by writing pieces for New York newspapers under the pseudonym \"Camillus.\" Of the thirty eight installments in the series, King wrote eight, numbers 23–30, 34, and 35, discussing the treaty's maritime and commercial aspects. He was re-elected in 1795 but resigned on May 23, 1796, having been appointed U. S. Minister by George Washington to Great Britain. \"Even though King was an outspoken Federalist politically, Republican President Thomas Jefferson, upon his elevation to the presidency, refused to recall him. In 1803, King voluntarily relinquished...\" this position.\n\nKing then returned to elected politics, for a long time with little success, but later he returned to the Senate. In April 1804, King ran unsuccessfully for the Senate from New York. Later that year, and again in 1808, King and fellow-signer Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were the candidates for Vice President and President of the declining Federalist Party, respectively, but had no realistic chance against Democratic Republican Thomas Jefferson with only 27.2% of the popular vote, losing by 45.6%, marking the highest recess in Presidential election history. In 1808 both candidates were renominated and lost against James Madison, gaining 32.4% this time.\n\nIn September 1812, when the unpopular War of 1812 against Great Britain helped the opposing Federalists to regain reputation, King led an effort at the Federalist party caucus to nominate a Federalist ticket for the presidential election that year, but the effort failed, as Democratic Republican DeWitt Clinton had the best chances to defeat his fellow party member Madison, which made the Federalists field no candidate. However, some sought to make King the nominee, in order to have a candidate under the Federalist banner on the ballot, and though little came of it, he did finish third in the popular vote with approximately 2% of the total. Shortly thereafter, King celebrated his first success after 10 years, when he was elected to his \"second tenure on Senate\" in 1813.\n\nIn April 1816 he ran for Governor of New York and lost to Daniel D. Tompkins. In the fall of that year, he did become the informal presidential nominee for the Federalist Party, as they did not meet for any convention. He only received 30.9% and lost again, this time to James Monroe, whose running mate, coincidentally, was Tompkins. King would be the last presidential candidate by the Federalists before their collapse. When he ran for re-election to the Senate in 1819, he ran as a Federalist even though the party was already disbanding and had only a small minority in the New York State Legislature. But, due to the split of the Democratic-Republicans, no successor was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1819, and the seat remained vacant until January 1820. Trying to attract the former Federalist voters to their side at the next gubernatorial election in April 1820, both factions of the Democratic-Republican Party now supported King, who served another term in the U.S. Senate until March 4, 1825. At the time the Federalist Party had already ceased to exist on the federal stage. During his second tenure in the Senate, he continued his career as an opponent of slavery, which he denounced as anathema to the principles underlying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. In what is considered the greatest speech of his career, he spoke against admitting Missouri as a slave state in 1820.\n\nSoon after his second term in the Senate ended, King was appointed Minister to Great Britain again, this time by President John Quincy Adams. But he was forced to return home a few months later due to failing health. He subsequently retired from public life.\n\nKing played a major diplomatic role as Minister to the Court of St. James from 1796 to 1803, and again from 1825 to 1826. Although he was a leading Federalist, Thomas Jefferson kept him in office until King asked to be relieved. Some prominent accomplishments that King had from his time as a national diplomat include a term of friendly relations with Britain and the United States (at least until it became hostile in 1805). With that in mind, he was able to successfully reach a compromise on the passing of the Jay Treaty being an avid supporter of it. King was outspoken against potential Irish immigration to the United States in wake of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In a September 13, 1798 letter to the Duke of Portland, King said of potential Irish refugees, \"I certainly do not think they will be a desirable acquisition to any Nation, but in none would they be likely to prove more mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater opportunities of propagating their principles than in any other Country.\" Also, while in Britain, he was in close personal contact with South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and facilitated Miranda's trip to the United States in search of support for his failed 1806 expedition to Venezuela.\n\nKing had a long history of opposition to the expansion of slavery and the slave trade. This stand was a product of moral conviction which coincided with the political realities of New England federalism. While in Congress, he successfully added provisions to the 1787 Northwest Ordinance which barred the extension of slavery into the Northwest Territory.\n\nBut he also said he was willing \"to suffer the continuance of slaves until they can be gradually emancipated in states already overrun with them.\" He did not press the issue very hard at this time. At the Constitutional Convention, he indicated that his opposition to slavery was based upon the political and economic advantages it gave to the South, but he was willing to compromise for political reasons.\nIn 1817, he supported Senate action to abolish the domestic slave trade and, in 1819, spoke strongly for the antislavery amendment to the Missouri statehood bill. In 1819, his arguments were political, economic, and humanitarian; the extension of slavery would adversely affect the security of the principles of freedom and liberty. After the Missouri Compromise, he continued to support gradual emancipation in various ways.\nAt the time of his death in 1827, King had a library of roughly 2,200 titles in 3,500 volumes. In addition, King had roughly 200 bound volumes containing thousands of pamphlets. King's son John Alsop King inherited the library and kept them in Jamaica, Queens, until his death in 1867. The books then went to John's son Dr. Charles Ray King of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. They remained in Pennsylvania until donated to the New-York Historical Society in 1906, where most of them currently reside. Some books have extensive marginalia. In addition, six commonplace books survive in his papers at the New-York Historical Society.\n\nIn his lifetime, King had been an avid supporter of Hamilton and his Fiscal programs and unsurprisingly that he would find himself also become one of the directors of the Hamilton-sponsored First Bank of the United States. Among other prominent things that occurred in King's life, he was first elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805, and was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.\nContrary to his previous position on the national bank of the United States, King found himself denying the reopening of a Second National Bank in 1816.\nFinally, in 1822, he was admitted as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.\n\nMany of King's family were also involved in politics and he had a number of prominent descendants. His brother William King was the first governor of Maine and a prominent merchant, and his other brother, Cyrus King, was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts.\n\nHis wife Mary Alsop was born in New York on October 17, 1769, and died in Jamaica, New York, on June 5, 1819. She was the only daughter of John Alsop, a wealthy merchant and a delegate for New York to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. She was also a great niece of Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She married Mr. King in New York City on March 30, 1786, he being at that time a delegate from Massachusetts to the Congress of the Confederation then sitting in that city.\n\nMrs. King was a lady of remarkable beauty, gentle and gracious manners, and well cultivated mind, and adorned the high station, both in England and at home, that her husband's official positions and their own social relations entitled them to occupy. A King family member once wrote to their wife of Mrs. King's beauty and personality as, \"'Tell Betsy King [Rufus's half-sister] her sister is a beauty. She is vastly the best looking woman I have seen since I have been in this city...She is a good hearted woman, and, I think, possesses all that Benevolence and kind, friendly disposition, that never fail to find respectable admirers'\". As mentioned earlier her \"remarkable beauty\" and \"well cultivated manner\" seems to help the Kings in the type of lifestyle they lives, one where the Kings found themselves in \"fashionable circles and entertained frequently\" ... (potentially helped by how \"[Mrs. King] was widely admired in New York society; her retiring nature set her apart.\"). The Kings found themselves having 7 children (of which 5 managed to live to adulthood). On June 5, 1819, Mrs. King died. \"She was buried in the old churchyard of Grace Church\". Rufus King remarked on her death regarding his wife, \"The example of her life is worthy of the imitation of us all\".\n\nRufus King died on April 29, 1827, and his funeral was held at his New York home in Jamaica, Queens. He is buried in the Grace Church Cemetery in Jamaica, Queens, New York.\n\nThe home that King purchased in 1805 and expanded thereafter and some of his farm make up King Park in Queens. The home, called King Manor, is now a museum and is open to the public.\n\nThe Rufus King School, also known as P.S. 26, in Fresh Meadows, New York, was named after King, as was the Rufus King Hall on the CUNY Queens College campus and King Street in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nConfusingly, Rufus King International School – High School Campus, formerly Rufus King High School, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is named after his grandson, Rufus King, a general in the American Civil War.\n\nRufus King's descendants number in the thousands today.

She has a Pakistani father and English mother, and emigrated to Adelaide, Australia, with her family in the early 1970s. Key themes in her work, such as migration, orientation, difference, strangerness, and mixed identities, relate directly to some of these early experiences. She completed her first degree at Adelaide University and doctoral research at the Centre for Critical and Cultural Theory, Cardiff University. \nShe now lives in the outskirts of Cambridge with her partner, Sarah Franklin who is an academic at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAhmed was based at the Institute for Women’s Studies at Lancaster University from 1994 to 2004, and is one of its former directors. She was appointed to the Department of Media and Communications at Goldsmiths College, University of London in 2004, and was the inaugural director of its Centre for Feminist Research, which was set up 'to consolidate Goldsmiths' feminist histories and to help shape feminist futures at Goldsmiths.' In spring 2009 Ahmed was the Laurie New Jersey Chair in Women’s Studies at Rutgers University and in Lent 2013 she was the Diane Middlebrook and Carl Djerassi Professor in Gender Studies at Cambridge University, where she conducted research on \"Willful Women: Feminism and a History of Will\". In 2015 she was the keynote speaker at the National Women's Studies Association annual conference. In 2016 Ahmed resigned from her post at Goldsmiths in protest over the alleged sexual harassment of students by staff there. She has indicated that she will continue her work as an independent scholar. She blogs at feministkilljoys, a project she continues to update. The blog is a companion to her book \"Living a Feminist Life\" (2017) that enables her to reach people; posts become chapters and the book becomes blogging material. The term \"feminist killjoy\" \"became a communication device, a way of reaching people who recognized in her something of their own experience.\". \n\nAhmed has been described as a prolific writer. One reviewer of her work commented, \"Few academic writers working in the UK context today can match Sara Ahmed in her prolific output, and fewer still can maintain the consistently high level of her theoretical explorations.” Ahmed has written eight single-authored books.\n\nPublished in 1998 by Cambridge University Press \n\nPublished in 2000 by Routledge. \n\nPublished in 2004, second edition 2014 by Edinburgh University Press and in New York by Routledge. \n\nPublished in 2006 by Duke University Press. \nAhmed often focuses on the subject of orientation and being orientated in space, especially in relationship to sexual orientation. In her book \"Queer Phenomenology: Orientation, Objects, Others\" Ahmed states that orientation refers to the objects and others that we turn to face as well as the space that we inhabit, and how it is that we inhabit that space. Ahmed brings together queer phenomenology as a way of conveying that orientation is situated in the lived experience.\n\nPublished in 2010 by Duke University Press.

{"id": "28606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28606", "title": "Seinfeld", "text": "Seinfeld\n\nSeinfeld is an American television sitcom that ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, with the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City, the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, including best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), friend and former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being \"a show about nothing\", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. \n\n\"Seinfeld\" was produced by West-Shapiro Productions and Castle Rock Entertainment in association with Columbia Pictures Television. In syndication, the series has been distributed by Sony Pictures Television since 2002. It was largely written by David and Seinfeld with script writers who included Larry Charles, Peter Mehlman, Gregg Kavet, Carol Leifer, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer, Steve Koren, Jennifer Crittenden, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Dan O'Keefe, Charlie Rubin, Marjorie Gross, Alec Berg, Elaine Pope, and Spike Feresten. A favorite among critics, the series led the Nielsen ratings in seasons six and nine, and finished among the top two (with NBC's \"ER\") every year from 1994 to 1998.\n\n\"Seinfeld\" is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms ever made. It has been ranked among the best television shows of all time in publications such as \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"TV Guide\". The show's most renowned episodes include \"The Chinese Restaurant\", \"The Parking Garage\", and \"The Contest\". In 2013, the Writers Guild of America voted it the No. 2 Best Written TV Series of All Time (second to \"The Sopranos\"). E! named the series the \"Number 1 reason the '90s ruled\", and quotes from numerous episodes have become catchphrases in popular culture.\n\n\n\n\nMany characters have made multiple appearances, like Jerry's nemesis Newman and his Uncle Leo. In addition to recurring characters, \"Seinfeld\" features numerous celebrities who appear as themselves or girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses and other acquaintances. Many actors who made guest appearances became household names later in their careers, or were already well known.\n\nMany \"Seinfeld\" episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines. For example, George's storyline, \"The Revenge\", is based on Larry David's experience at \"Saturday Night Live\". \"The Contest\" is also based on David's experiences. \"The Smelly Car\" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car. \"The Strike\" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday—Festivus. Other stories take on a variety of turns. \"The Chinese Restaurant\" consists of George, Jerry and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode. \"The Boyfriend\", revolving around Keith Hernandez, extends through 2 episodes. \"The Betrayal\" is famous for using reverse chronology, and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play, \"Betrayal\". Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features \"Notes About Nothing\", \"Inside Look\", and \"Audio Commentary\". In \"The Maestro\", Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald's coffee case. \"The Outing\" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality.\n\nThe series was often described as \"a show about nothing\". However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated \"the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that.\"\n\n\"Seinfeld\" broke several conventions of mainstream television. The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality. An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes revolve around the characters' involvement in the lives of others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the \"no hugging, no learning\" rule. Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even Susan's death elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show.\n\nThe characters are \"thirty-something singles with vague identities, no roots, and conscious indifference to morals\". Usual conventions, like isolating the characters from the actors playing them and separating the characters' world from that of the actors and audience, were broken. One such example is the story arc where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named \"Jerry\". The show within a show, \"Jerry\", was much like \"Seinfeld\" in that it was \"about nothing\" and Seinfeld played himself. The fictional \"Jerry\" was launched in the season four finale, but unlike \"Seinfeld\", it wasn't picked up as a series. \"Jerry\" is one of many examples of metafiction in the show. There are no fewer than twenty-two fictional movies featured, like \"Rochelle, Rochelle\". Because of these several elements, \"Seinfeld\" became the first TV series since \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" to be widely described as postmodern.\n\nJerry Seinfeld is an avid Abbott and Costello fan, and has cited the Abbott and Costello Show as an influence on \"Seinfeld.\" \"Everybody on the show knows I'm a fan. We're always joking about how we do stuff from their show. George and I will often get into a riff that has the rhythm from the old Abbott and Costello shows. And sometimes I'll hit George in the chest the way Abbott would hit Costello.\" The series includes numerous references to the team. George Costanza's middle name is \"Louis,\" after Costello. \"The Old Man\" episode features a cantankerous character named \"Sid Fields\" as a tribute to the landlord on the team's TV show. Kramer's friend is named Mickey Abbott. A copywriter for the J. Peterman catalog is named Eddie Sherman, after the team's longtime agent. In Episode 30, Kramer hears the famous Abbott and Costello line, \"His father was a mudder. His mother was a mudder.\"\n\nMany terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture. Notable catchphrases and terms include:\n\nThe lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as Seinlanguage, the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor.\n\nA signature of \"Seinfeld\" is its theme music. Composed by Jonathan Wolff, it consists of distinct solo sampled bass synthesizer riffs (played on a Korg M1 synthesizer) which open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by beatboxing. The bass synthesizer music eventually replaced the original piano/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of the pilot episode. The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.\n\nIn \"The Note\", the first episode of season three, the bumper music featured a scatting female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like \"easy to beat\". Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements. In the commentary of \"The Note\", Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time.\n\nIn the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be restyled in different ways depending on the episode. For instance, in \"The Betrayal\", part of which takes place in India, the theme is heard played on a sitar.\n\n\"Seinfeld\" stood out from family and group sitcoms of its time. The principal characters are not related by family or work connections but remain distinctively close friends throughout the series.\nMany characters were based primarily on Seinfeld's and David's real-life acquaintances. Two prominent recurring characters were based on well-known people: Jacopo Peterman of the J. Peterman catalog (based on John Peterman), and George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees. Many characters were introduced as new writers got involved with \"Seinfeld\". Other characters based on real people include the Soup Nazi and Jackie Chiles, who was based on Johnnie Cochran.\n\n\"Seinfeld\" follows its own structure: story thread is presented at the beginning of every episode, which involves the characters starting in their own situations. Rapid scene-shifts between plot lines bring the stories together. Even though it does not follow a pattern as other sitcoms, the characters' stories variously intertwine in each episode. Despite the separate plot strands, the narratives reveal the creators' \"consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy\" among the small cast of characters.\n\nThe show maintains a strong sense of continuity—characters and plots from past episodes are often referenced or expanded on. Occasionally, story arcs span multiple episodes and even entire seasons, the most memorable being season four, which revolved around the pilot pitch to NBC by Jerry and George. Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in \"The Stake Out\" and he ends the relationship when things do not work out in \"The Stock Tip\". Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the \"Peterman catalog\". Larry David, the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"—David's later comedy series—expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.\n\nA major difference between \"Seinfeld\" and sitcoms which preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's producers was: \"No hugging, no learning\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as \"a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings\". This leads to very few happy endings, except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters getting a justly deserved comeuppance.\n\nThe show premiered as \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up. Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next 4 episodes were filmed. These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of \"Cheers\" on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30 p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called \"FM\". The series was renamed simply \"Seinfeld\" after the failure of short-lived 1990 ABC series \"The Marshall Chronicles\". After airing the remaining four episodes of its first season the summer of 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes. Larry David believed that he and Jerry Seinfeld had no more stories to tell, and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes. Season two was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the (Persian) Gulf War. It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and eventually flipped with veteran series \"Night Court\" to 9:00.\n\nTV critics championed \"Seinfeld\" in its early seasons, even as it was slow to cultivate a substantial audience. For the first three seasons, Jerry's stand-up comedy act would bookend an episode, even functioning as cut scenes during the show. A few episodes set a benchmark for later seasons. \"The Deal\" establishes Jerry and Elaine's relationship by setting rules about sleeping together and remaining friends. \"The Parking Garage\" was the first episode shot with no audience for the episode and, after \"The Chinese Restaurant\", with not showing Jerry's apartment. \"The Keys\" contains a crossover to CBS show \"Murphy Brown\", marking the first such cooperation between rival networks. \"The Busboy\" introduces George, Kramer and Elaine as having their own storylines for the first time. Although Castle Rock Entertainment's Glenn Padnick thought Jerry Seinfeld was too generous, showcasing his co-stars' comedic talent became a trademark throughout the series.\n\nLarry Charles wrote an episode for season two, \"The Bet\", in which Elaine buys a gun from Kramer's friend. This episode wasn't filmed because the content was deemed unacceptable, and was replaced by the episode \"The Phone Message\". \"The Stranded\", aired in season three, was intended for season two. In the beginning of this episode, Jerry clears up the continuity error over George's real estate job.\n\nSeason four marked the sitcom's entry into the Nielsen ratings Top 30, coinciding with several popular episodes, such as \"The Bubble Boy\" in which George and the bubble boy argue over \"Trivial Pursuit\", and \"The Junior Mint\" in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room. This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, \"Jerry\". Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of \"Seinfeld\" episodes was cut.\n\nMuch publicity followed the controversial episode, \"The Contest\", an Emmy Award-winning episode written by co-creator Larry David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word \"masturbation\" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references. Midway through that season, \"Seinfeld\" was moved from its original 9:00 p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30 p.m. on Thursdays, following \"Cheers\" again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom \"Home Improvement\" on ABC had aired at the same time and \"Improvement\" kept beating \"Seinfeld\" in the ratings. NBC moved the series after Ted Danson announced the end of \"Cheers\" and \"Seinfeld\" quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00 p.m. \"Cheers\" reruns that spring. The show won an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Comedy Series\" in 1993, beating out its family-oriented, time-slot competitor \"Home Improvement\", which was only in its second season on rival network ABC.\n\nSeason five was an even bigger ratings-hit, consisting of popular episodes, such as \"The Puffy Shirt\" in which Jerry feels embarrassed wearing a \"pirate\" shirt on \"The Today Show\", \"The Non-Fat Yogurt\" featuring Rudy Giuliani, the Republican then-mayor-elect of New York, and \"The Opposite\" in which George, doing the opposite of what his instincts tell him he should do, lands a job with the New York Yankees and Elaine leaves \"Pendant Publishing\" because of a comedy of errors that lead to its demise. Another story arc has George returning to live with his parents. In the midst of the story arc, Kramer creates and promotes his coffee table book. The show was again nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to the \"Cheers\" spin-off \"Frasier\", then in its first season. \"Seinfeld\" was nominated for the same award every year for its entire run but always lost to \"Frasier\", which went on to win a record thirty-nine Emmy Awards in its eleven-season run.\n\nIn season six, Andy Ackerman replaced Tom Cherones as director of the show. The series remained well-regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as \"The Beard\" in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched \"Melrose Place\", \"The Switch\" in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo, and \"The Understudy\" in which Elaine meets J. Peterman for the first time. Story arcs used in this season were Elaine working as a personal assistant to her eccentric boss Justin Pitt and George's parents' temporary separation. This was the first season in which \"Seinfeld\" reached No. 1 in the Nielsen Ratings. The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined with the end stand-up segment no longer appearing, as the storylines for all four characters grew denser.\n\nIn season seven, a story arc involved George getting engaged to his ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross, after the pilot \"Jerry\" proved unsuccessful. In it, George spends most of the season regretting and trying to get out of the engagement. Along with the regular half-hour episodes, two notable one-hour episodes were \"The Cadillac\" in which George plans to date award-winning actor Marisa Tomei and \"The Bottle Deposit\" with Elaine and Sue Ellen participating in a bidding war to buy JFK's golf clubs in an auction.\n\nThe show's ratings were still going strong in its final two seasons. Larry David left at the end of season seven, although he continued to voice Steinbrenner, so Seinfeld assumed David's duties as showrunner, and, under the direction of a new writing staff, \"Seinfeld\" became a faster-paced show. The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedy—Jerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilities—and storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor. For example, in \"The Bizarro Jerry\", Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famed \"man hands\". Some notable episodes from season eight include \"The Little Kicks\" showing Elaine's horrible dancing, and \"The Chicken Roaster\" which portrays the \"Kenny Rogers Roasters\" chicken restaurant which opened during that time. A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to Burma in \"The Foundation\" until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in \"The Money\", followed by Elaine writing Peterman's biography in \"The Van Buren Boys\", which leads to Kramer's parody of Kenny Kramer's Reality Tour seen in \"The Muffin Tops\".\n\nThe final season included episodes like \"The Merv Griffin Show\" in which Kramer converts his apartment into a talk-show studio and plays the character of talk-show host, \"The Betrayal\" that presents in reverse chronological order what happened to Sue Ellen's wedding in India, and \"The Frogger\" in which George pushes a \"Frogger\" machine across the street, mimicking the action of the game itself. The last season included a story arc in which Elaine has an on/off relationship with Puddy. Despite the enormous popularity and willingness of the cast to return for a tenth season, Seinfeld decided to end the show after season nine, believing he would thereby be able to ensure the show would maintain its quality and go out on top. NBC offered him over $100 million for a tenth season, but Seinfeld declined.\n\nA major controversy caused in this final season was the accidental burning of a Puerto Rican flag by Kramer in \"The Puerto Rican Day\". This scene caused a furor among Puerto Ricans, and as a result, NBC showed this episode only once. Jerry Seinfeld defused the protestors by not letting this episode continue in syndication, as revealed in \"Inside Look\" on DVD. However, the episode would be added to the syndicated rerun package several years later uncut.\n\nAfter nine years on the air, NBC and Jerry Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998. The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including the \"New York Times\". Jerry Seinfeld was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine's first issue of 1998. The series ended with a seventy-five-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in syndication, in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998. Before the finale, a forty-five-minute retrospective clip show, \"The Chronicle\", was aired. The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.\n\nIt was the first episode since the finale of season seven, \"The Invitations\", to feature opening and closing stand-up comedy acts by Jerry Seinfeld. The finale was filmed before an audience of NBC executives and friends of the show. The press and public were shut out of the taping in order to keep its plot secret; those who attended the shoot of the final episode were required to sign written \"vows of silence\". The secrecy only seemed to increase speculation about how the series would end. The producers of the show tweaked the media about the hype, spreading a false rumor about Newman ending up in the hospital and Jerry and Elaine sitting in a chapel, presumably to marry.\n\nThe final episode enjoyed a historic audience, estimated at 76.3 million viewers (58% of all viewers that night) making it the fourth most watched regular series finale in U.S. TV history, behind \"M*A*S*H\", \"Cheers\" and \"The Fugitive\". However, the finale received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the show. The finale poked fun at the many rumors that were circulating, seeming to move into multiple supposed plots before settling on its true storyline—a lengthy trial where the gang is prosecuted for violating a \"Good Samaritan law\" and sentenced to prison terms.\n\nAccording to \"Forbes\" magazine, Jerry Seinfeld's earnings from the show in 1998 came to US$267 million, including syndication earnings. He refused NBC's offer of $5 million per episode, or over $100 million total, to continue the show into a tenth season. The offer NBC made to Seinfeld was over three times higher per episode than anyone on TV had ever been offered before. Seinfeld told the network that he was not married nor had children, and wished to focus on his personal life. As reported in July 2007, he was the second-highest earner in the TV industry, earning at the time $60 million a year. The show became the first TV series to command over $1 million a minute for advertising–a mark previously attained only by the Super Bowl.\n\nAccording to Barry Meyer, chairman of Warner Bros. Entertainment, \"Seinfeld\" made $2.7 billion through June 2010. the show has made an estimated $4.06 billion in syndication. Steve Bannon, who invested in the show, later said, \"We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication. We were wrong by a factor of five\".\n\n\"Seinfeld\" began as a twenty-three-minute pilot titled \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\". Created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt and the effort by men to properly interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.\n\nThe pilot was filmed at Stage 8 of Desilu Cahuenga studios, the same studio where \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" was filmed (this was seen by the crew as a good omen), and was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood. The pilot was first screened to a group of two dozen NBC executives in Burbank, California in early 1989. It didn't yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like \"The Cosby Show\" and \"The Golden Girls.\" Brandon Tartikoff was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as \"Too New York, too Jewish\". Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as \"weak\", which Warren Littlefield, then second-in-command in NBC's entertainment division, called \"a dagger to the heart\". Comments included, \"You can't get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat\"; \"Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character\"; \"Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast\"; and \"Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?\" Seinfeld and David didn't see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, \"We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment.\"\n\nAround the time the show's pilot was filmed, Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the show, had also produced another pilot for NBC that featured Ann Jillian in her almost-similarly eponymous TV series. After \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" tested poorly among audiences, Castle Rock then devoted their focus to Jillian's series, which tested better with audiences and received a full-season order. \"Ann Jillian\" would last only a single season of 13 episodes and would be off the air by the end of 1990.\nWhen NBC announced its 1989–90 primetime schedule in May 1989, \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" was not included, but supporters of the show didn't give up on it. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama \"Jake and the Fatman\", receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19, meaning that the pilot was watched by 10.9% of American households, and that 19% of all TVs in use at the time were tuned into it. The ratings didn't exhibit regional skew that Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Despite the poor test results, Ludwin cancelled one of the Bob Hope specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\", which formed the rest of the show's first season (the series was by then retitled to just \"Seinfeld\"); a move without which \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist Phil Rosenthal later stated there would be no \"Seinfeld\". Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order. The show was renamed simply \"Seinfeld\", but it wouldn't return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it would be another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show. Preston Beckman, who was in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, \"The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits.\"\n\nWhen it was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26. These ratings were high enough to secure a second season. NBC research showed that the show was popular with young male adults, a demographic sought after by advertisers. This gave NBC an incentive to keep broadcasting the show. One DVD reviewer, Britt Gillette, wrote that \"this initial episode exhibits the flashes of brilliance that made \"Seinfeld\" a cultural phenomenon.\"\n\nThere are two high-definition versions of \"Seinfeld\". The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases. Syndicated broadcast stations and the cable network TBS began airing the syndicated version of \"Seinfeld\" in HD. Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame, while restoring previously cropped images on the sides, from the 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 frame.\n\nElizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of \"Seinfeld\" with recourse to the incongruity theory of humor: \"The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation. For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic.\" Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on \"The Marine Biologist\", where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on \"The Red Dot\", where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine's expense by giving her a marked-down cashmere sweater.\n\nNod Miller, of the University of East London, has discussed the self-referential qualities of the show:\n\nWilliam Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in \"Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing\". Some entries include \"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\", \"George's Failed Zest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\", \"Elaine's Moral Character\", \"Kramer the 'Seducer, \"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\", \"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\", \"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\", and \"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\".\n\n\"Seinfeld\" has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s. It was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993, Golden Globe Award for Best TV-Series (Comedy) in 1994 and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 1995, 1997 and 1998. Apart from these, the show was also nominated for an Emmy award from 1992 to 1998 for Outstanding Comedy series, Golden Globe award from 1994 to 1998 for Best TV-Series (Comedy), and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series from 1995 to 1998.\n\n\"TV Guide\" named it the greatest TV show of all time in 2002. and in 2013, they ranked it as the second greatest TV show.\n\nA recurring feature of \"Seinfeld\" was its inclusion of specific products, especially candy, as plot points. These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., Junior Mints, Twix, Jujyfruits, bite size Three Musketeers, Snickers, Nestlé Chunky, Oh Henry!, Drake's Coffee Cake and PEZ), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. Oh Henry! bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., Chuckles, Clark Bar, Twinkies). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.\n\nThe show's creators claim that they weren't engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. \"I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie\", explained \"Seinfeld\" writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in \"The Hollywood Reporter\". \"At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'\"\n\nMany advertisers capitalized on the popularity of \"Seinfeld\". American Express created a webisode where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated Superman (voiced by Patrick Warburton, who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the Today Sponge created the \"Spongeworthy\" game, on their website, inspired by \"The Sponge\". An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a Chrysler commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with Lee Iacocca plays on his George's relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for Vodafone which ran in Australia where he dressed and acted exactly like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls.\n\nIn addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a Scotch brand called \"Hennigan's\" (a portmanteau of \"Hennessy\" and \"Brannigans\") and a canned meat product called \"Beef-a-reeno\" (a parody of \"Beef-a-roni\").\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment released all nine seasons of \"Seinfeld\" on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 between 2004 and 2007. On November 6, 2007, \"Seinfeld: The Complete Series\" was released on DVD. The complete series box set includes a 2007 \"roundtable\" reunion of the four main cast members and Larry David; only highlights of this were also included in the Season 9 set.\n\nOn April 29, 2015, it was officially announced, during Hulu's upfronts presentation in New York, that all nine seasons of Seinfeld would be available for online streaming, via the video service, starting in June 2015. The news was first reported by \"Deadline\" and \"Variety\", citing the deal at around $130 million to $180 million. On May 20, 2015, Hulu announced that every episode would be available, on June 24, 2015.\n\nOn November 8, 2016, the Australian streaming service Stan announced via Twitter that later in the week all episodes would be available to stream for the first time in Australia. All episodes were available from November 11, 2016 with the remastered versions of all episodes on the service featuring HD and Widescreen enhancements. The widescreen offered was cropped from the original 4:3 format negatives, thus resulting in better visual quality than the previously available DVD version, however the top and bottom portions of the frame were cut out to achieve the widescreen aspect ratio.\n\nOn the November 1, 2007, episode of \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", Jerry Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of shooting one last scene, after they leave jail. He mentioned that he was too busy to do it at the time, but didn't announce what the scene would entail, as its production isn't a certainty.\n\nIn commentary from the final season DVD, Seinfeld outlines that he and Jason Alexander spoke about this scene being in Monk's Cafe, with George saying \"That was brutal\" in reference to the foursome's stint in prison.\n\nOn an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" that Jerry Seinfeld hosted on October 2, 1999, a sketch was produced that showed what life was like for Jerry behind bars after being transferred to the fictional prison portrayed on the HBO series \"Oz\". The roughly four-minute sketch shows the opening credits for the HBO series with clips of Jerry mixed in doing various activities around the prison. The sketch continues and mixes in different story lines from both \"Oz\" and \"Seinfeld\" and has Jerry interacting with various characters from the show in his typical quick-witted, sarcastic way.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards have all tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season. This gave rise to the term \"Seinfeld curse\": the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's \"Seinfeld\" popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the \"Seinfeld curse\" are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's \"Watching Ellie\", Jason Alexander's \"Bob Patterson\" and \"Listen Up!\", and Michael Richards' \"The Michael Richards Show\". Larry David said of the curse, \"It's so completely idiotic. It's very hard to have a successful sitcom.\"\n\nThis phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of Larry David's HBO program \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\". However, the Emmy award-winning success of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the CBS sitcom \"The New Adventures of Old Christine\" led many to believe that she had broken the curse. In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, \"I'm not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!\" The show was on the air for five seasons starting March 13, 2006 before its cancellation on May 18, 2010; the series produced enough episodes to air in reruns in syndication for several years, something the other shows didn't achieve. The \"Saturday Night Live\" episode guest-hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Louis-Dreyfus went on to win six further Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmys for her acclaimed performance as Vice President Selina Meyer in HBO's comedy series \"Veep\".\n\nEarly in March 2009, it was announced that the \"Seinfeld\" cast would reunite for season seven of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\". The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing their real life selves. The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a \"Seinfeld\" reunion show as a ploy to get his ex-wife, Cheryl, back. Along with the four main characters, some \"Seinfeld\" supporting actors like Wayne Knight, Estelle Harris and Steve Hytner appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show. Though much dialogue in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the \"Seinfeld\" special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by \"Seinfeld\" regular Andy Ackerman, making this the first time since \"Seinfeld\" went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.\n\nJerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Wayne Knight, playing their respective \"Seinfeld\" characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. FOX came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York that year. An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" titled \"The Over-Cheer\". Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, who produces the series, did not pay for it. Seinfeld has indicated that he thinks the webisode will probably be the last cast reunion, saying, \"I have a feeling you've seen the final coda on that very unique experience.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "32850684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32850684", "title": "Uzun-Mirko", "text": "Uzun-Mirko\n\nMirko Apostolović, known as Uzun-Mirko (; 1782–1868) was a Serbian \"voivode\" (military commander), with the \"bimbaša\" rank during the Serbian revolution; he took part in both the First and Second Serbian Uprising. He was famed for his many fatal wounds, undetected infiltration into the Ottoman fort at Belgrade, among other operations, which gained him many awards. He is the founder of the Uzun-Mirković family.\n\nMirko was born in 1782, in Brajkovac (then Smrdljikovac), near Lazarevac. His family were of the Piperi, and settled first in Rudnik, they then moved to Belgrade, and during the Austrian-Turkish War they lived in Srem. His father Petar Apostolović and grandfather Apostol died in the Austrian-Turkish War in 1792. They fought in Kočina Krajina, in the Austrian freicorps against the Ottoman Turks. At the return from Srem, Mirko and his mother lived in Mislođin, then he moved to Belgrade, where he learned to be a tailor. He received his nickname 'Uzun' from his height, the Turkish word for tall.\n\nUzun-Mirko reached fame when he participated in the Battle of Belgrade that took place from November 29 to December 12, 1806, when he together with his band and bimbaša Konda, a former mercenary commander serving the Ottomans in Belgrade, entered undetected in the city and from the interior opened the Sava Gate for the Serbian Army. He was seriously wounded during the fighting. He was wounded; in the head in Karanovac (1805, modern Kraljevo), in his left side in Paraćin (1805), in the shoulder in Smederevo (1805), in the right hand caused by knife in Sava (1806), in the hip in Užice (1805 or 1807), in the breast in Malajnica (1807), over the thighs caused by saber in Drina (1810). After the First Serbian Uprising, he rehabilitated in Wien. He also participated in the Second Serbian Uprising, in the battles of Lipar, Čačak and Dublje. When he sought a pension from the \"Sovjet\" (Serbian government) in 1842, they asked him for documents, upon which he answered \"my documents are my 7 wounds!\".\n\nUzun-Mirko was, like other elders, connected to the Church and obeyed the laws; he had a space in his house on the upper floor, where he every morning and evening prayed in front of icons. According to contemporaries, he prayed loudly, \"so that it could be heard outside\".\n\nOn May 21, 1865, for the 50-year-anniversary of the Second Uprising, Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia, personally brought the Takovo cross for Uzun-Mirko, and also awarded him with the Montenegrin golden medallion of Obilić (as a Hero). He died in 1868, and was buried in Belgrade, his grave is situated in the Novo Groblje in Belgrade.\n\nUzun-Mirko is the founder of the Uzun-Mirković family. His son was Infantry colonel Ljubomir Uzun-Mirković (1832–1905), he in turn had a son, Division general Dragoljub Uzun-Mirković (1875–1941), who in turn had a son, Artillery captain Miroslav Uzun-Mirković (1941). His maternal cousin was Division general Dragutin Đ. Okanović, who in 1906 as a member of the Black Hand, founded \"Novi pokret\".\n\n\n"}
