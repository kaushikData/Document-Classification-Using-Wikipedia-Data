{"id": "9556285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9556285", "title": "Afshar Operation", "text": "Afshar Operation\n\nThe Afshar Operation was a military operation in Afghanistan that took place on February 11-12, 1993 during the Afghan Civil War (1992-96). The operation was launched by Ahmad Shah Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani's Islamic State of Afghanistan government and the allied Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's Ittehad-i Islami paramilitary forces against Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezbe Islami and Abdul Ali Mazari's Hezbe Wahdat militias in the densely populated Afshar district in west Kabul. The Hazara-Hezbe Wahdat together with the Pashtun-Hezbe Islami of Hekmatyar had been shelling densely populated areas in northern Kabul from their positions in Afshar, killing thousands. To counter the shelling, government forces attacked Afshar in order to capture the positions of Wahdat and its leader Mazari, and to consolidate parts of the city controlled by the government.\n\nThe operation became an urban war zone and escalated into what is called the Afshar massacre when Sayyaf's Ittehad-i Islami forces and Massoud's Jamaat-e-Islami forces committed \"repeated human butchery\" turning against the Shia Muslims. Reports emerged that Sayyaf's Sunni Wahhabist forces backed by Saudi Arabia rampaged through Afshar, murdering, raping and burning homes. Both the Hezb-e Wahdat and the Ittihad-i Islami had been involved in systematic abduction campaigns against civilians of the \"opposite side\", a pattern Ittihad continued in Afshar. Besides Ittihad commanders, two of the nine government commanders on the ground, Anwar Dangar (who later defected to the Taliban) and Mullah Izzat, were also named as leading troops that carried out abuses. Reports describe looting, indiscriminate shelling by Sayyaf´s men and massacaring of thousands of civilians from Hazara ethnic group. In one instance fleeing civilians in the streets were hit by fire from government soldiers. At the same time it was reported that in another incidence government troops carried a wounded Afshar civilian to safety and that some commanders on the ground tried to stop abuses from taking place.\n\nThe Islamic State's Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud ordered an immediate halt to the crimes on the second day of the operation, but especially looting and the destruction of houses continued to take place for a second day. Massoud then appointed a Shia commander, Hussain Anwari, to ensure the safety of the Shia civilian population in Afshar. However Anwari himself became infamous for terrorizing Pashtun civilians, who were also raped and assaulted.\n\nHe also ordered the withdrawal of all offensive troops and persuaded Sayyaf to do the same. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission paid ransoms for approximately 80 to 200 people held by several Ittihad commanders. But 700-750 people abducted by Ittihad during the campaign were never returned, and were presumably killed or died in captivity. The same commission received information that many women were abducted during the operation, but said that few families would report it. The Afshar operation proceeded with Massoud's approval, although he disapproved of Sayyaf's methods.\n\nThe Afshar operation, which saw hundreds of Sunni Pashtuns and Shia Hazaras systemically targeted and depopulated from villages in the area, was the first such sectarian oriented incident in Afghanistan's modern history. It is also considered to have been one of the worst single events in Afghanistan's wars.\n\nOn April 26, 1992, the mujahedin leaders announced a new peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accords. During the period discussed in this article, the sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the \"Islamic State of Afghanistan,\" an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibu\nlah government through the Peshawar Accords. The legitimate representatives of the government were President Burhanuddin Rabbani and minister of defense Ahmad Shah Massoud.\n\nWith the exception of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami which to a very large extent was controlled by the regime in Pakistan, all parties were ostensibly unified under this government in 1993. Hekmatyar shelled Kabul with tens of thousands of rockets in 1992 to gain power for himself. Hekmatyar repeatedly was offered the position of prime minister but he did not want to share power.\n\nAfter failed attempts for negotiations a brutal war broke out between the Saudi-backed Ittihad-e-Islami of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the Jamiat-e-Islami of Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Hezb-i Wahdat of Abdul Ali Mazari. According to Human Rights Watch numerous Iranian agents were assisting Wahdat forces, as Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence in the new government. Saudi agents, private or governmental, were trying to strengthen Sayyaf and his Ittihad faction to the same end. Rare ceasefires commonly collapsed within days.\n\nIn December 1992 Abdul Ali Mazari's Wahdat entered in an alliance with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. With his newly created alliance with Hezb-i Wahdat, Hekmatyar increased his rockets and shell attacks on the city. Human Rights Watch concludes:\nThe Afghanistan Justice Project gives the following objectives for the military operation:\n\nAccording to a Human Rights Watch report, \"credible and consistent\" accounts from several officials who worked in Shura-e-Nazar (the informal politico-military organization headed by Rabbani's defense minister, Ahmad Shah Massoud) and the Rabbani interim government reveal that a military campaign against Hezb-i Wahdat was planned and approved by officials at the \"highest levels\" of the Rabbani government.\n\nAccording to Afghanistan Justice Project although individual commanders cannot be identified, brigade and battalion leaders can be listed. For Jamiat, these include Qasim Fahim, Anwar Dangar, Mullah Ezat, Mohammad Ishaq Pashiri, Haji Bahlol Panshiri, Baba Jalandar Panjshiri, Khanjar Akhund Panshiri, Musdoq Lalai, and Baz Mohammad Ahmadi Badakhshani. From Ittihad these included Haji Shir Alam, Amir Anwar Oryakhail, Zulmai Tufan, Dr. Abdullah, Jaglan Naeem, Mullah Taj Mohammad, Abdullah Shah, Khinjar, Abdul Manan Diwana, Amanullah Kochi, Shirin, Mushtaq Lalai, and Mullah Kachkol.\n\nBy February 1993, Massoud had conducted negotiations with dissident Wahdat commanders who signed secret protocols with Massoud in order to avoid a long fight promising to cooperate during the conflict and to capture Mazari and his cabinet.\n\nThe men of Mohammad Fahim, who was in charge of special operations, contacted a number of the Shia commanders and obtained their co-operation. This allowed the artillery to be pre-positioned in advance of the battle, with a ZU-23 gun and 30 men being positioned on Aliabad hill, with the purpose of targeting the Central Silo, Afshar, Kart-iSeh, Kart-iChar and Kart-I Sakhi. The forces allied with the government began to bomb the area around Afshar before troops began to move in around 4:00 am on February 11. Troops moved from Badambagh to the top of Radar hill, which was part of the Afshar ridge. According to Afghanistan Justice Project:\n\nA large contingent of both Ittihad and Jamiat forces advanced towards Afshar from the west. The closest point of the front line to the main target of the operation was the Kabul Polytechnic. A Jamiat force advanced along the main Afshar Road, from Kart-iParwan and the Intercontinental Hotel, towards the Social Science Institute, entering Afshar from the east. The ISA forces did not advance along other sections of the front line marking the west Kabul enclave, although they maintained an intense bombardment and had ample forces deployed to maintain a threat of advance.\n\nAccording to this, by 13:00 the main defense line of Hezb-I Wahdat had failed and the forces, including Mazari and his top commanders, began to flee on foot. By 14:00 the Social Science Institute was captured and troops were in control of Khushal Mina and Afshar.\n\nMazari re-established a defense line near the Central Silo and Kart-iSakhi, at the edge of Khushhal Mina, keeping control over most of West Kabul. Following this many of the residence fled to Taimani, an Ismali area of the city.\n\nThe objectives of the military operation were largely attained during the operation. Wahdat's headquarters and many of their positions were captured so that they were not able to shell Kabul from those positions anymore.\n\nNumerous abuses were reported and large information was collected through interviews by two separate reports – one by Afghanistan Justice Project and another by Human Rights Watch. The abuses largely took place after the military operation itself when forces started to establish posts and to search homes.\n\nThe vast majority of testimony regarding the Afshar operation suggests that the abuses were largely carried out by the Ittihad forces of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and the Jamiat forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Ittihad forces played a major role in the assault, working directly under Sayyaf and receiving pay from him. The Ittihad forces were not absorbed into the ministry of defense. Sayyaf acted as the de facto general commander of Ittihad forces during the operation and was directly in touch with senior commanders by radio.\n\nAccording to reports, Wahdat soldiers as well as male Hazara citizens were being arrested and executed mostly by Ittihad forces. Unarmed civilians as well were being killed, with men in particular being targeted. Other men were abducted and taken to the base of Sayyaf's Ittihad in Paghman and made to dig trenches and bury the dead. Those who survived stated they saw on the bodies evidence of torture and mutilations. Human Rights Watch suggests that 70-80 people were killed in the streets fighting, while 700-750 people disappeared. It states that between 80-200 people were later released after ransoms were paid to Sayyaf's Ittihad commanders.\n\nJohn Jennings, a journalist with the AP present in Afshar during the operation around Massoud's troops, went into considerable detail to debunk allegations of a systematic massacre of civilians. Although he did leave open the possibility that some captured Wahdat fighters were summarily executed rather than being treated as POWs by troops furious at Wahdat atrocities against Kabul civilians during the preceding months. Jennings recounts entering a nearby basement where Wahdat fighters had tied up non-Hazara hostages with wire, shot them and tried to burn the bodies, before fleeing the scene ahead of Massoud's advancing troops. Jennings also describes Ahmad Shah Massoud's followers rescuing a wounded Hazara civilian caught in the crossfire during the height of the battle. Despite these written reference — and although Jennings is quoted as a reliable source on other topics in the Human Rights Watch reports — any account of what he witnessed during and after the Afshar battle was left out by Human Rights Watch editors.\n\nThe Afshar campaign and the surrounding violence were ended by the Islamabad Accord between the Islamic State and Hekmatyar's alliance (including Hezb-i Wahdat) fashioned in late February 1993 and signed on March 7, 1993. There were a few weeks of relative calm. Hezb-i Wahdat ally Gulbuddin Hekmatyar took the long-offered position of prime minister in the Rabbani government.\n\nThe Islamabad Accord among other things stated:\nPulitzer Prize-winning Roy Gutman of the United States Institute of Peace wrote in \"How We Missed the Story: Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan\":\nHekmatyar turned out afraid to enter the city (he had shelled for one year) more than once to take up his post. He attended one cabinet meeting but by late March, unwilling to compromise with other cabinet members not belonging to his faction and while his aides were still in the prime minister's palace, Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami forces were again shelling Kabul.\n\n"}
{"id": "46000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46000", "title": "Alexandru Ioan Cuza", "text": "Alexandru Ioan Cuza\n\nAlexandru Ioan Cuza (, or Alexandru Ioan I, also anglicised as Alexander John Cuza; 20 March 1820 – 15 May 1873) was Prince of Moldavia, Prince of Wallachia, and later \"Domnitor\" (Ruler) of the Romanian Principalities. He was a prominent figure of the Revolution of 1848 in Moldavia. He initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.\n\nBorn in Bârlad, Cuza belonged to the traditional boyar class in Moldavia, being the son of Ispravnic Ioan Cuza (who was also a landowner in Fălciu County) and his wife Sultana (or Soltana), a member of the Cozadini family of Phanariote origins. Alexander received an urbane European education, becoming an officer in the Moldavian Army (rising to the rank of colonel). He married Elena Rosetti in 1844.\nIn 1848, known as the year of European revolutions, Moldavia and Wallachia fell into revolt. The Moldavian unrest was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer (\"see 1848 Wallachian revolution\"). Young Cuza played a prominent enough part so as to establish his liberal credentials during the Moldavian episode and to be shipped to Vienna as a prisoner, where he made his escape with British support.\nReturned during the reign of Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, he became Moldavia's minister of war in 1858 representing also Galați in the ad hoc Divan at Iași. Cuza was acting freely under the guarantees of the European Powers in the eve of the Crimean War for a recognition of the Prince of Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of Moldavia and Walachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was nominated as a candidate in both principalities by the pro-unionist Partida Națională (profiting of an ambiguity in the text of the Treaty of Paris). Cuza was finally elected as Prince of Moldavia on 17 January 1859 (5 January Julian) and, after \"street pressure\" changed the vote in Bucharest, also Prince of Wallachia, on 5 February 1859 (24 January Julian). He received the firman from the Sultan on 2 December 1861 during a visit to Istanbul.\nHe was recipient of the Order of Medjidie, Order of Osmanieh, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and Order of the Redeemer.\n\nAlthough he and his wife Elena Rosetti had no children, she raised as her own children his two sons from his mistress Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenović: Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza (1864–1889), and Dimitrie Cuza (1865–1888 \"suicide\").\n\nThus Cuza achieved a de facto union of the two principalities. The Powers backtracked, Napoleon III of France remaining supportive, while the Austrian ministry withheld approval of such a union at the Congress of Paris (18 October 1858); partly as a consequence, Cuza's authority was not recognized by his nominal suzerain, Abdülaziz, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, until 23 December 1861, (and, even then, the union was only accepted for the duration of Cuza's rule).\n\nThe union was formally declared three years later, on 5 February 1862, (24 January Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital city.\n\nCuza invested his diplomatic actions in gaining further concessions from the Powers: the sultan's assent to a single unified parliament and cabinet for Cuza's lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus, he was regarded as the political embodiment of a unified Romania.\n\nAssisted by his councilor Mihail Kogălniceanu, an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.\n\nHis first measure addressed a need for increasing the land resources and revenues available to the state, by \"secularizing\" (confiscating) monastic assets in 1863. Probably more than a quarter of Romania's farmland was controlled by untaxed Eastern Orthodox \"Dedicated Monasteries\", which supported Greek and other foreign monks in shrines such as Mount Athos and Jerusalem (a substantial drain on state revenues). Cuza got his parliament's backing to expropriate these lands. He offered compensation to the Greek Orthodox Church, but Sophronius III, the Patriarch of Constantinople, refused to negotiate; after several years, the Romanian government withdrew its offer and no compensation was ever paid. State revenues thereby increased without adding any domestic tax burden.\nThe land reform, liberating peasants from the last corvées, freeing their movements and redistributing some land (1864), was less successful. In attempting to create a solid support base among the peasants, Cuza soon found himself in conflict with the group of Conservatives. A liberal bill granting peasants title to the land they worked was defeated. Then the Conservatives responded with a bill that ended all peasant dues and responsibilities, but gave landlords title to all the land. Cuza vetoed it, then held a plebiscite to alter the Paris Convention (the virtual constitution), in the manner of Napoleon III.\nHis plan to establish universal manhood suffrage, together with the power of the Domnitor to rule by decree, passed by a vote of 682,621 to 1,307. He consequently governed the country under the provisions of \"Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris\" (\"Statute expanding the Paris Convention\"), an organic law adopted on 15 July 1864. With his new plenary powers, Cuza then promulgated the Agrarian Law of 1863. Peasants received title to the land they worked, while landlords retained ownership of one third. Where there was not enough land available to create workable farms under this formula, state lands (from the confiscated monasteries) would be used to give the landowners compensation.\n\nDespite the attempts by Lascăr Catargiu's cabinet to force a transition in which some corvées were to be maintained, Cuza's reform marked the disappearance of the boyar class as a privileged group, and led to a channeling of energies into capitalism and industrialization; at the same time, however, land distributed was still below necessities, and the problem became stringent over the following decades – as peasants reduced to destitution sold off their land or found that it was insufficient for the needs of their growing families.\n\nCuza's reforms also included the adoption of the Criminal Code and the Civil Code based on the Napoleonic code (1864), a Law on Education, establishing tuition-free, compulsory public education for primary schools (1864; the system, nonetheless, suffered from drastic shortages in allocated funds; illiteracy was eradicated about 100 years later, during the communist regime). He founded the University of Iași (1860) and the University of Bucharest (1864), and helped develop a modern, European-style Romanian Army, under a working relationship with France. He is the founder of the Romanian Naval Forces.\n\nCuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent authoritarian in the style of Napoleon III. Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked bureaucrats, Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, Maria Catargiu-Obrenović, and popular discontent culminated in a coup d'état.\n\nCuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called \"monstrous coalition\" of Conservatives and Liberals. At four o'clock on the morning of 22 February 1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his abdication. On the following day they conducted him safely across the frontier.\n\nHis successor, Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was proclaimed Domnitor as Carol I of Romania on 20 April 1866. The election of a foreign prince with ties to an important princely house, legitimizing Romanian independence (which Carol came to do after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878), had been one of the liberal aims in the revolution of 1848.\n\nDespite the participation of Ion Brătianu and other future leaders of the Liberal Party in the overthrow of Cuza, he remained a hero to the radical and republican wing, who, as Francophiles, had an additional reason to oppose a Prussian monarch; anti-Carol riots in Bucharest during the Franco-Prussian War (\"see History of Bucharest\") and the coup attempt known as the Republic of Ploiești in August 1870, the conflict was eventually resolved by the compromise between Brătianu and Carol, with the arrival of a prolonged and influential Liberal cabinet.\n\nCuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in Paris, Vienna and Wiesbaden, accompanied by his wife, his mistress, and his two sons. He died in Heidelberg. His remains were buried in his residence in Ruginoasa, but were moved to the Trei Ierarhi Cathedral in Iași after World War II.\n\n"}
{"id": "18768704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18768704", "title": "Arthur Derounian", "text": "Arthur Derounian\n\nJohn Roy Carlson (April 9, 1909, Alexandroupoli – April 23, 1991, New York City) is one of the many pen names of Arthur Derounian, born Avedis Boghos Derounian, the journalist and best-selling author of \"Under Cover\".\n\nDerounian wrote for the \"Armenian Mirror-Spectator\", \"Fortune Magazine\", the \"Council Against Intolerance\" and the \"Friends of Democracy.\" In the 1950s he founded and managed the Armenian Information Service, which made a number of publications. His exposé writing has been the subject of lawsuits.\n\nDerounian is also notable for editing the manifesto of Armenia's first Prime Minister, Hovhannes Kajaznuni.\n\nHe was born to Boghos Derounian and Eliza Aprahamian in Dedeagach, Adrianople Vilayet, Ottoman Empire (today Alexandroupoli, Greece). The Balkan Wars and First World War had an unsettling effect on the entire region, and his hometown repeatedly changed hands. The family moved several times, spending time in Turkey and Sofia, Bulgaria, where his brother Steven Derounian (who later became a Republican Representative) was born. Eventually the family emigrated to the United States, settling in Mineola, New York. He went on to study at New York University's School of Journalism. Later, he married Marie Nazarian and had a daughter named Elyse and a son named Robert.\n\nHe died of a heart attack on April 23, 1991, while researching at the library of the American Jewish Committee on East 56th Street.\n\nIn 1933, Archbishop Leon Tourian was assassinated at the altar of his New York church. The assassins were members of the Dashnaks, a radical Armenian group who accused the Archbishop of treason to the Armenian national cause. Deeply shocked, Derounian spent the rest of his life opposing the Dashnaks as well as other violent radicals - in particular, fighting fascism and all forms of racism.\n\nDuring the 1948 Israeli-Arab War, Derounian also infiltrated among the Arabs fighting the newborn Israel, travelling extensively in the Arab parts of the expiring Mandatory Palestine as well as in Egypt and Syria. He took a highly partisan position on the Israeli-Arab Conflict, stating at the conclusion of his book \"Cairo to Damascus\" that \"\"In the simplest of terms, Israel, as I saw it, represented Good; the Arab world represented Evil\".\n\n\"Under Cover: My Four Years in the Nazi Underworld of America - The Amazing Revelation of How Axis Agents and Our Enemies Within Are Now Plotting To Destroy the United States\" became a best seller when published in 1943.\n\nDerounian was a tireless investigator of subversive activity, and infiltrated numerous \"patriotic\" groups, some of which he listed in the opening of his book \"Under Cover\": German American Bund, Christian Front, American Nationalist Party, American Women Against Communism, The Gray Shirts, America First Committee, Christian Mobilizers, The American Defense Society, Anglo-Saxon Federation of America, National Workers League, Yankee Freemen, Flanders Hall, American Patriots among many others.\n\nAmong the groups he also helped expose was the international Nazi propaganda news agency \"World-Service\".\n\nHe was also the chief investigator of the anti-fascist organization, Friends of Democracy.\n\nIn a speech Representative Arthur G. Klein attempted to give in the US House in 1944 and which was printed in \"The Nation,\" Klein praises Derounian's book \"Under Cover\":\nThis expose made him enemies, and several parties instituted actions against him for alleged libelous material. Three of the four cases failed the consolidated case before the jury, leaving a verdict in favor only of lawyer Jeremiah Stokes, which was later overturned. The lawsuit claimed that Derounian had held Stokes up for ridicule. Stokes is first mentioned on page 365 of \"Under Cover\", and his patriotism questioned in the next chapter, which begins:\n\nI was in the room alone with two men. The one who had pumped both my hands in welcome was a small round man with a bald dome and rotund face. He had small, beady eyes and he peered at you from behind rimmed glasses. He was definitely of the single-track, uncompromising zealot type. Jeremiah Stokes had let his law practice slide and was devoting the major portion of his time to the writing of \"patriotic\" tracts.\nDerounian appealed; the appellate court reversed the district court and remanded the matter, stating in the overview:\n\nThe court found error in the submission to the jury of a physical description of the individual as small and rotund in stature, bald, round of face, and having small and beady eyes. The description of the individual was not reasonably calculated to subject him to public ridicule. It was error to submit to the jury ridicule of personal appearance as an element of damages.\nShortly after the publication of \"Under Cover\", Derounian as \"John Roy Carlson\" set himself with an assignment: to go undercover again and investigate the collaboration of Nazi and antisemitic people and organizations with the Arabs in the civil war that broke out in Palestine after the UN resolution to partition the country, a war that would be the early stage of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nHe decided to travel to Palestine in 1947 via England and Egypt, to chronicle the war. Traveling with his camera, he documented what he saw and the material for this adventure became his book \"Cairo to Damascus\", published in 1951.\n\nDuring his investigation, Carlson covered, not just the original subject, but many other aspects of the war. Throughout the war, Carlson didn't travel with the Western journalists. He traveled with Arabs, posing as an anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi, pro-Arab sympathizer in order to win their confidences. In general, everywhere he visited in the Arab world, Carlson presented extreme anti-Jewish views, whereby he could hear from his conversation partners, be it Arab civilians and military men, Nazi-German mercenaries or the Grand Mufti's Bosnian volunteers, their extreme views and their aspiration to put an end to Jewish existence in Palestine. He travelled between the two sides, crossing the hot zone in the midst of armed conflict, while in the Jewish side of Jerusalem, he identified himself with his true identity, as the writer of \"Under Cover\".\n\nCarlson was an eye-witness to the pull-out of the British troops, the activities of the Haganah, and the hand-over to the United Nations forces. He observed first-hand the activities of the Arab Legion trained and armed by the British and the battle for the state of Israel.\n\nIn January 1948, Carlson arrived in London, where he presented himself as Charles L. Morey, \"sales manager of the Homestead Farm Appliance Corporation, with offices and plant in St. John, Indiana\" - an identity he had used already in 1945, in his correspondence with \"every British hate-monger and anti-democrat\" he read or heard about. In London he met with British Fascists who supported Oswald Mosley as well as mercenaries that were about to join the Arabs and fight alongside with them.\n\nCarlson left London and reached Cairo on March 2, 1948. When he tried to take photographs in the city, he was detained by the police under the suspicion of being a Jewish spy. On their way to the police station, Carlson and the two policemen were followed by a crowd yelling \"Jew!\". When Carlson turned around and shouted \"I am an American!\", he was yelled back: \"Then you are worse than a Jew!\". In Cairo he met with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and got them to talk about their hatred towards Jews.\n\nOn April 1, 1948, Carlson left Cairo accompanying the Egyptian \"Green Shirts\" volunteers as a photographer. They entered Palestine through Rafah. Not far from Be'er Sheba, Carlson saw for the first time a Jewish communal settlement – Kibbutz Beit Eshel - \"contrasted sharply with the squalor of Arab villages\". Through Hebron, the men reached Jerusalem. Carlson accompanied the Arab fighters, moving between different points of conflict. On April 13, 1948, the Hadassah medical convoy massacre took place, after which Carlson says the Arabs claimed \"they had been falsely informed of large concentrations of Jewish bands gathering near the Hospital and University.\" When asked who had informed them, the Arabs of Aboutor answered: \"The English!\".\n\nCarlson went with his friends back to Egypt in order to purchase more weapons. On their way they passed very near Kfar Etzion, where he witnessed a battle between the Arab Legion and the Jewish Kibbutz. On their way back from Egypt to Palestine, the volunteer fighters' truck drove near the ruins of Kibbutz Kfar Darom, towards Gaza City. On the beach, a member of the city council said to Carlson: \"See that water? One month from now it will be black as far as the horizon with the nude bodies of floating Jews.\" Carlson and his friends proceeded to Jerusalem, during a wave of Arab defeats all over the country. In his book, Carlson is referring to the Palestinian exodus that followed those defeats: \"This flight-psychosis, which prevailed among the Arabs ... is a difficult phenomenon to explain. It was a mass hysteria induced by poor morale and by fear of revenge and retribution for the Arab massacres and lootings from 1920 on.\"\n\nCarlson claims the Arab Legion was seen in Gaza, Hebron and Jerusalem, while the British formally stated that \"all units of the Arab Legion had left Palestine for Trans-Jordan prior to the end of the Mandate\". On the night of the May 14 - the night before the Israeli declaration of independence, Carlson saw Gush Etzion burning down. His good friend Moustafa told him that night: \"Every Arab knows that we will be in Tel Aviv one month from tomorrow. We will sit in the cafes by the sea, drink coffee...eat baklawa and enjoy the Jewish girls!\"\n\nCarlson decided to cross to the Jewish part of Jerusalem, so he could \"be with the Jews on the first day of the new Jewish State\". Holding a small American flag he crossed just in time to cover the departure of Alan Cunningham, the High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan. He experienced the siege of the Jewish part of Jerusalem from within, and depicted the inhabitants' hardships, shortage, hunger, continuous bombardment and grief over the dead.\n\nCarlson went back and forth between the Jewish and the Arab sides. He met Abdullah el-Tell, the commander of the Arab Legion in Jerusalem, and under his protection he witnessed the fall of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem and the evacuation of its Jewish inhabitants on May 28, 1948, after a siege that lasted six months. He also took the chance to take a photograph of King Abdullah I of Jordan when he came to Jerusalem just after the Jewish surrender.\n\nCarlson then visited Bethlehem, Jericho, Amman and Damascus, where he met with pro-Nazi Arab circles who admired the German Führer, and introduced him to a German Nazi with whom he raised a glass and toasted \"Heil Hitler\". In Damascus, Carlson managed to be accepted for a short interview with Haj Amin al-Husseini. Carlson's last visit in the Arab side of the conflict was to Beirut, the capitol of Lebanon, which astonished him with its modernity in comparison to the simplicity of Amman and Damascus. In Beirut, he met with Christians who were aspiring to democracy and some of them even dared to express pro-Zionist views. His attempt to interview Fawzi al-Qawuqji failed, when Qawuqji decided to leave angrily after being asked about his lies about his victories and his sojourn in Germany.\n\nCarlson's journey amongst the Arabs ended when, through Nicosia, he reached Haifa on a ship along with 280 Jewish displaced persons, Holocaust survivors from the Cyprus internment camps.

Poonacha was Chief Minister of Coorg, Minister in Mysore State, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha), Union Railway Minister of India and Governor of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.\n\nC. M. Poonacha was a descendant of the Coorg Dewans. During the Freedom Movement he was sentenced to imprisonment twice during the Salt Satyagraha in 1932 and 1933. He was again imprisoned in 1940–41. and in 1942–44. He became a member of All-India Congress Committee in 1938. Also, in 1938 he was elected to Coorg District Board, became its President in 1941 and in 1945 he was elected to Coorg Legislative Council. From 1945 to 1951 he was leader of the Congress Legislative Party in the Council. He hence became a prominent member of the Indian National Congress party in Coorg.\n\nIn 1947 Coorg was a separate state in South India until 1956. The other states of South India at that time were Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency, Mysore kingdom, Travancore kingdom, Cochin kingdom and Hyderabad kingdom. The Coorg State Assembly had a strength of 24 members and the Cabinet consisted of just two members.\n\nC M Poonacha represented the Coorg state as a member of the Constituent Assembly.\n\nTwo parties fought the 1952 state elections: the Takkadi ('Scales of Justice') party under veteran Gandhian Pandyanda Belliappa, who was a dominant political force and voice of Coorg with its anti-merger plank, and the Congress under C.M. Poonacha in Coorg. Poonacha was elected Chief Minister of Coorg State (1952–56) in the first general elections. Coorg had two MPs in the Union Parliament then, besides having a state legislative body. In 1956 the State Reorganisation Act was passed. Coorg was merged with Mysore and the legislative body at Mercara dissolved. While the Chief Minister was C.M. Poonacha, (who also held the finance portfolio), the only other Minister was Home Minister, Kittur Mallappa. C.M. Poonacha had won the Beriathnad seat while K. Mallappa won the second seat from Sanivarasante. The Congress won 15 seats and Independents (opposing merger), represented by the Takkadi party, won nine seats. Under various circumstances Coorg was merged with the then Mysore in 1956. This election was widely controversial as it was believed that many people from nearby districts of Hunsur, Mysore and Mandya were brought to Kodagu to vote as the government of Karnataka(Congress) believed people of Kodagu will vote overwhelmingly in opposition of the merger. The head of State was the Chief Commissioner, Colonel Dayasingh Bedi. As the governor’s equivalent, Colonel Bedi was presiding over the meetings of the Cabinet.\n\nKodagu was, amidst protests, merged with the then Mysore State in 1956. The 1951 pattern of voting continued in 1957 when elections were held for the two Assembly constituencies in Kodagu – Virajpet and Madikeri. Poonacha of the INC was re-elected from Madikeri. He defeated Kolera Karumbayya of the Praja Socialist Party.\n\nAfter the formation of the new Mysore State Poonacha was Minister for Home and Industries under its Chief Minister S. Nijalingappa. He was also Chairman, State Trading Corporation of India from 1959 to 1963. He led the Government of India Trade delegation to some East European countries in 1960 and was the leader of the State Trading Corporation delegation to Japan in 1961.\n\nPoonacha was elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1964. Later Poonacha was made Union Minister without portfolio in Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet. From 1 to 24 January 1966, he was Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance and from 25 January 1966 to 12 March 1967 Minister of State in the Ministry of Transport, Aviation, Shipping and Tourism. He contested and won the Lok Sabha seat for the Mangalore constituency in 1969. He contested again in 1971 as a candidate of NCO party, but lost.\n\nAfter some time he became Union Minister for Railways from 1967 to 1969 (at first interim and then final) and Minister for Steel and Heavy Engineering in 1969. At that time he was the Member of Parliament representing Mangalore Lok Sabha constituency to which Coorg then belonged.\n\nAfter his retirement from active politics, he served two terms as governor, once as Governor of Madhya Pradesh (Governors of Madhya Pradesh) taking charge on 17 August 1978 and later as Governor of Orissa on 30 April 1980 (Governors of Odisha).\n\nPoonacha had two sons and two daughters. Two of his children, C. P. Belliappa and Kaveri Nambisan, are well-known writers in English.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26496842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26496842", "title": "Eddie Van Halen", "text": "Eddie Van Halen\n\nEdward Lodewijk Van Halen (born January 26, 1955) is a Dutch-American musician, songwriter, and producer. He is the main songwriter and founder — with drummer Alex Van Halen, bassist Mark Stone, and singer David Lee Roth — of the American hard rock band Van Halen.\n\nIn 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Van Halen number eight in the list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists. In 2012, he was voted number one in a \"Guitar World\" magazine reader's poll for \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".\n\nBorn in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Edward Lodewijk van Halen is the son of Dutch father, Jan van Halen, a clarinetist, saxophonist, and pianist, and Indonesian-born Indo (Eurasian) mother, Eugenia van Halen ( van Beers). Van Halen's middle name, \"Lodewijk\", is after composer Ludwig van Beethoven, \"Lodewijk\" being the Dutch equivalent of \"Ludwig\". He continued this tradition by naming his son Wolfgang after composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nIn February 1962, the family moved to the United States, settling in Pasadena, California. Both Eddie and his older brother, Alex, are naturalized U.S. citizens. The brothers learned to play the piano as children starting at the age of six.\n\nThey commuted from Pasadena to San Pedro to study with an elderly man, who taught them classical piano. Although they hated the commute, they continued as their mother would discipline them if they refused to go.\n\nVan Halen revealed in an interview that he was never able to read music. Instead, he learned from watching and listening. During recitals of Bach or Mozart, he would improvise. From 1964 through 1967, he won first place in the annual piano competition held at Long Beach City College. Afterward, the judges would comment that he had an interesting interpretation of the classical piece. Van Halen's view was, \"What? I thought I was playing it correctly!\" However, according to one interview, playing the piano did not prove to be challenging or interesting to him. Consequently, while Alex began playing the guitar, Eddie bought a drum kit and began practicing for hours every day.\n\nAfter Eddie heard Alex's performance of The Surfaris' drum solo in the song \"Wipe Out\", he decided to switch instruments and began learning how to play the electric guitar. According to Eddie, as a teen, he would often practice while walking around at home with his guitar strapped on or sitting in his room for hours with the door locked.\n\nEddie Van Halen acknowledged the importance of supergroup Cream's \"I'm So Glad\" on \"Goodbye Cream\" to be \"mind-blowing\". He once claimed that he had learned almost all of Eric Clapton's solos in the band Cream \"...note for note.\" \"I've always said Eric Clapton was my main influence,\" Van Halen said, \"but Jimmy Page was actually more the way I am, in a reckless-abandon kind of way.\"\n\nEddie and Alex formed their first band with three other boys, calling themselves \"The Broken Combs\", performing at lunchtime at Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena, where Eddie was in the fourth grade. Eddie would later say that this was when he first felt the desire to become a professional musician.\n\nIn 1972, Van Halen formed another band, originally called \"Genesis\". The name was changed to \"Mammoth\" when Van Halen became aware of the English progressive rock band of the same name.\n\nMammoth consisted of Van Halen on guitar and lead vocals, his brother Alex on drums and bass guitarist Mark Stone. Mammoth had no P.A. system of their own, so they rented one from David Lee Roth, a service for which he charged by the night. Van Halen became frustrated with singing lead vocals, and decided they could save money by adding Roth to the band. Soon after, Michael Anthony replaced Stone on the bass guitar. The band opted to change its name because Roth suggested that the last name of the two brothers \"sounded cool\".\n\nAt one point, the band considered using the name \"Rat Salade\", after the Black Sabbath song of the same name, before settling on \"Van Halen\". The band originally began playing cover material, ranging from pop to disco.\n\nIn 1976, band supporter Rodney Bingenheimer invited Kiss bass guitarist Gene Simmons to check out a Van Halen show. Impressed, Simmons soon produced a Van Halen demo tape with recording beginning at the Village Recorder studios in Los Angeles and finishing with overdubs at the Electric Lady Studios in New York.\n\nLooking to strike a recording contract, Simmons shopped the demo tape around, but found no success. In May 1977 at the Starwood, Van Halen was spotted by record producer Ted Templeman. Like Simmons, Templeman was impressed and quickly convinced Warner Bros. Records executive Mo Ostin to sign the band, and they accepted 24 hours later. Their self-titled debut album was recorded in mid-September to early October 1977, and was released on February 10, 1978.\n\nVan Halen released a total of six albums with vocalist David Lee Roth: \"Van Halen\" (1978), \"Van Halen II\" (1979), \"Women and Children First\" (1980), \"Fair Warning\" (1981), \"Diver Down\" (1982), and \"1984\" (1984).\n\nIn the early 1980s, the band began having increasing trouble working together as a cohesive unit. According to Gene Simmons' book \"Kiss and Make-Up\", Eddie Van Halen approached Simmons in 1982 about possibly joining Kiss to replace Ace Frehley, chiefly because of his personality conflicts with Roth. Simmons and Alex Van Halen persuaded Eddie to remain in Van Halen, while Kiss replaced Frehley with Vinnie Vincent.\n\nShortly afterwards, Van Halen released the album \"1984\", from which the single \"Jump\", was their first and only #1 single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Other singles released from the album performed well, particularly \"Hot for Teacher\", the video for which featured a scantily dressed model playing the part of a female elementary school teacher and young actors portraying the band members as children. The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard charts, behind only Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\".\n\nJimmy Page said at the time, \"For my money, Van Halen was the first significant new kid on the block. Very dazzling.\"\n\nIn 1982, Van Halen was invited by producer Quincy Jones to contribute the guitar solo for Michael Jackson's single, \"Beat It\", but reportedly declined any payment for the recording, deeming a credit on the album sufficient.\n\nWith the arrival of former Montrose singer Sammy Hagar in July 1985, the band's sound changed somewhat to adapt to the strengths of the new vocalist. Eddie Van Halen's keyboard playing became more prominent, as heard in songs such as \"Dreams\" and \"Love Walks In\". Hagar appeared on four studio albums with the band, \"5150\" (1986), \"OU812\" (1988), \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\" (1991), and \"Balance\" (1995), as well as one live album, \" \"(1993).\n\nDuring Hagar's time with the band, some fans informally referred to the band as \"Van Hagar\" to distinguish it from the David Lee Roth lineup. With Hagar, all four studio releases reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts. \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\" was awarded the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal. The live album \"Live: Right Here, Right Now\" peaked at No. 5.\n\nFollowing Hagar's departure, the group briefly reunited with original singer David Lee Roth and released \"Best Of – Volume I\", a greatest-hits package, in October 1996. Two new songs were recorded for the album, \"Me Wise Magic\"—which reached No. 1 on the mainstream rock chart as a single—and \"Can't Get This Stuff No More\". However, previous disagreements resurfaced and the reunion did not last. Roth left in September 1996 after the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe band auditioned many prospective replacements for Hagar, finally settling on Gary Cherone, former frontman of Boston hard rock band Extreme. Cherone predicted that the new lineup would last \"10 years\"; however, the \"Van Halen III\" (1998) album was poorly received. The band completed a world tour with their new single \"Without You\" and returned to the studio to start on a second album. However, Cherone soon after departed amicably and, without a lead singer, Van Halen went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2004, Van Halen returned with Hagar as their lead singer. A greatest hits package, \"The Best of Both Worlds\", was released to coincide with the band's reunion tour. The album included three new tracks recorded with Hagar, \"Up For Breakfast\", \"It's About Time\", and \"Learning to See\". The band toured the United States, visiting 80 cities.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, it was officially announced on the band's website that David Lee Roth would rejoin Van Halen for their summer tour. Excitement over the tour waned when, on February 20, 2007, reports surfaced that the tour was indefinitely postponed. A previously planned compilation of Roth-era Van Halen hits was shelved.\n\nAfter six months and a stint in rehabilitation for Eddie, the band confirmed on August 13, 2007, at a press conference in Los Angeles, they would do a tour with Roth from late 2007 into 2008 across North America, with worldwide touring and a new album to follow. Persistent rumors had long indicated the Van Halen brothers were in talks with Roth to rejoin the band for a tour and/or new material. Van Halen's then 15-year-old son Wolfgang was to play bass on the tour, replacing Michael Anthony.\n\nVan Halen toured the U.S. and Canada from September 2007 through summer 2008. The band released their twelfth studio album, \"A Different Kind of Truth\", on February 7, 2012, their first album in 14 years and their first album with Roth since \"1984\". \n\nVan Halen's approach to the guitar involves several distinctive components. His use of two-handed tapping, natural and artificial harmonics, vibrato, and tremolo picking, combined with his rhythmic sensibility and melodic approach, have influenced an entire generation of guitarists. The instrumental \"Eruption\" was voted No. 2 in \"Guitar World\" magazine's readers poll of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos. Despite his massive success, Van Halen has never fully learned to read music.\n\nThe 1978 instrumental \"Eruption\" by Van Halen showcased a solo technique called tapping, using both left and right hands on the guitar neck. Although Van Halen popularized tapping, he did not invent the tapping technique which had been used infrequently by various guitarists in blues and rock in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. \n\nGeorge Lynch said in an interview that he and Van Halen saw Harvey Mandel tap at the Starwood in the 1970s. Van Halen's accounts of how he came across the tapping technique vary. In one interview with \"Guitar World\", he said:\n\nVan Halen also employs tapping harmonics. He holds the pick between his thumb and middle finger, which leaves his index finger free for tapping, and also makes for easy transitions between picking and tapping. \n\nVan Halen holds a patent for a flip-out support device that attaches to the rear of the electric guitar. This device enables the user to play the guitar in a manner similar to the piano by orienting the face of the guitar upward instead of forward.\n\nVan Halen has used a variety of pickups including Gibson PAF's, 1970s Mighty Mites, DiMarzios and Ibanez Super 70s. He was using Mighty Mite pickups in 1977 club photos, just prior to the recording of the first Van Halen album. Mighty Mite pickups were OEM pickups made by Seymour Duncan and were copies of DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups. Seymour Duncan apparently rewound a Gibson PAF for Van Halen around early 1978.\n\nHis later guitars include various Kramer models from his period of endorsement for that company (most notably the Kramer 5150, from which Kramer in its Gibson-owned days based their Kramer 1984 design, an unofficial artist signature model) and three signature models: the Ernie Ball/Music Man Edward van Halen Model (which continues as the Ernie Ball Axis), the Peavey EVH Wolfgang (which has been succeeded by a similar guitar called the HP Special), and the Charvel EVH Art Series, on which Van Halen does the striping before they are painted by Charvel. His current deal is with Fender, making the EVH series of striped guitars, Wolfgang guitars, and EVH amps.\n\nIn an interview in \"Guitar World\" magazine in July 1985, Van Halen states that his \"brown sound\" is \"...basically a tone, a feeling that I'm always working at ... It comes from the person. If the person doesn't even know what that type of tone I'm talking about is, they can't really work towards it, can they?\"\nIn an interview with \"Billboard\" magazine in June 2015, he states that with the expression \"brown sound\" he actually tried to describe the sound of his brother Alex Van Halen's snare drum, which he thought \"...sounds like he’s beating on a log. It’s very organic. So it wasn’t my brown sound. It was Alex's.\" \nVan Halen is the inventor on . The main claim is for a supporting member on the back of a stringed instrument, allowing the musician to play and/or fret the instrument in new ways.\n\nHe is the lead inventor of , for the D-Tuna he invented to enable a non-floating Floyd Rose-equipped guitar to quickly change the tuning of the low E string by a whole step.\n\nAnother patent naming Van Halen as inventor is D388117 for the headstock design for the EVH Wolfgang guitars.\n\nOn August 29, 1980, Eddie met actress Valerie Bertinelli at a Van Halen concert in Shreveport, Louisiana. They married in California on April 11, 1981; and have one child, a son, Wolfgang (born March 16, 1991).\n\nAfter his father's death in December 1986 and his brother Alex's eventual sobriety in April 1987, Eddie Van Halen struggled with drug and alcohol abuse on and off for twenty years. In April 1988, he was hospitalized with dengue fever while on a wedding anniversary vacation in Australia. On September 2, 1994, he made his first attempt at sobriety.\n\nSuffering from lingering injuries from past high-risk acrobatic stage antics and crashes, Van Halen underwent hip replacement surgery in November 1999, after his chronic avascular necrosis, with which he was diagnosed in 1995, became unbearable. In April 2001, Van Halen confirmed he had been undergoing treatment for tongue cancer since May 2000. The subsequent surgery removed roughly a third of his tongue. He was declared cancer-free in May 2002.\n\nSince the 2004 tour, Van Halen had largely disappeared from the public eye, with the exception of occasional appearances including the 14th annual Elton John Academy Awards party and a performance at a Kenny Chesney concert. In December 2004, Van Halen attended \"Dimebag\" Darrell Abbott's funeral, and donated the black and yellow guitar featured on the \"Van Halen II\" album inlay, stating that it was always a favorite of Dimebag's. The guitar was put in Darrell's Kiss Kasket and he was buried with it.\n\nOn December 5, 2005, Van Halen's wife, Valerie Bertinelli, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court, after four years of separation, which was finalized on December 20, 2007. On March 8, 2007, Van Halen announced on the official band website that Van Halen was entering rehabilitation for unspecified reasons. However, both Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony have made statements indicating that Van Halen's personality had changed due to alcohol abuse.\n\nVan Halen emerged from rehabilitation and appeared publicly as an honorary official during a NASCAR race at Phoenix International Raceway on April 21, 2007. He unveiled a new Fender Stratocaster with a paint job made for the NASCAR races before the ceremony. In 2007, Van Halen was honored in the Xbox 360 version of \"Guitar Hero II\".\n\nOn October 6, 2008, Van Halen proposed to his girlfriend, Janie Liszewski, an actress and stunt-woman who became Van Halen's publicist in 2007. The two married on June 27, 2009, at his Studio City estate, with his son Wolfgang and Bertinelli in attendance.\nEddie's brother Alex officiated the ceremony, while his son served as best man. On January 1, 2011, Eddie and Wolfgang Van Halen attended Bertinelli's remarriage. \n\nIn mid-January 2011, he attended the winter NAMM Show to present his new Wolfgang guitars, sharing the Fender booth with fellow guitar player Yngwie Malmsteen.\n\nIn August 2012, Van Halen underwent an emergency surgery for a severe bout of diverticulitis. His recovery time was four to six months, causing Van Halen to postpone their Japanese tour, which was originally scheduled to begin in November 2012.\n\nEddie has donated 75 of his personal guitars to The Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation stating: \"I wanted to give back to the community, and especially kids in need who want an instrument but didn’t have the opportunity I had. I wanted to donate instruments because I have so many guitars and nobody would take them... until we found Mr. Holland’s Opus.\"\n\n\nEddie Van Halen has appeared on several projects outside of his eponymous band.\n\nVan Halen is on the Hollywood Rock Walk located in front of Guitar Center's Hollywood store on Sunset Boulevard.\n\n"}
{"id": "526549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526549", "title": "Evenki language", "text": "Evenki language\n\nEvenki , formerly known as Tungus or Solon, is the largest member of the northern group of Tungusic languages, a group which also includes Even, Negidal, and (the more closely related) Oroqen language. The name is sometimes wrongly given as \"Evenks\". It is spoken by Evenks in Russia and China.\n\nIn certain areas the influences of the Yakut and the Buryat languages are particularly strong. The influence of Russian in general is overwhelming (in 1979, 75.2% of the Evenkis spoke Russian, rising to 92.7% in 2002). Evenki children were forced to learn Russian at Soviet residential schools, and returned with a “poor ability to speak their mother tongue...\". The Evenki language varies considerably among its dialects which are divided into three large groups: the northern, the southern and the eastern dialects. These are further divided into minor dialects. A written language was created for Evenkis in the Soviet Union in 1931, first using a Latin alphabet, and from 1937 a Cyrillic one. In China, Evenki is written experimentally in the Mongolian script. The language is generally considered endangered.\n\nEvenki is a member of the Tungusic family. Its similarity to Manchu, the best-documented member of the family, was noted hundreds of years ago, first by botanist P. S. Pallas in the late 18th century, and then in a more formal linguistic study by M. A. Castren in the mid-19th century, regarded as a \"pioneer treatise\" in the field of Tungusology. The exact internal structure of the Tungusic family is a matter of some debate. Some scholars propose two sub-families: one for Manchu, and another for all the other Tungusic languages, including Evenki. SIL International's Ethnologue divides Tungusic into two sub-families, Northern and Southern, with Evenki alongside Even and Negidal in the Northern sub-family, and the Southern family itself subdivided into Southwestern (among which Manchu) and Southeastern (Nanai and others). Others propose three or more sub-families, or at the extreme a continuum with Manchu at one end and Evenki at the other.\n\nBulatova enumerated 14 dialects and 50 sub-dialects within Russia, spread over a wide geographical area ranging from the Yenisei River to Sakhalin. These may be divided into three major groups primarily on the basis of phonology:\n\n\nEvenks in China also speak several dialects. According to Ethnologue, the Hihue or Hoy dialect is considered the standard; Haila’er, Aoluguya (Olguya), Chenba’erhu (Old Bargu), and Morigele (Mergel) dialects also exist. Ethnologue reports these dialects differ significantly from those in Russia.\n\nSome works focused on individual Russia dialects include (Barguzin), (Tommot), and (Sakhalin).\n\nThe Evenki language typically has CV syllables but other structures are possible. Bulatova and Grenoble list Evenki as having 11 possible vowel phonemes; a classical five-vowel system with distinctions between long and short vowels (except in ) and the addition of a long and short , while Nedjalkov claims that there are 13 vowel phonemes. Evenki has a moderately small consonant inventory; there are 18 consonants (21 according to Nedjalkov 1997) in the Evenki language and it lacks glides or semivowels.\n\nBelow are tables of Evenki consonant phonemes, including those identified by Nedjalkov (1997) in italics.\nThe phoneme () has a word-final allophone, , as well as an intervocalic variant, . Likewise, some speakers pronounce intervocalic as . Speakers of some dialects also alternate and . Consonant inventories given by researchers working on dialects in China are largely similar. The differences noted: Chaoke and Kesingge \"et al.\" give instead of and lack , , or ; furthermore, Kesingge \"et al.\" give instead of .\n\nBelow is a chart of Evenki vowels found among Russian dialects, including those identified by Nedjalkov (1997) in italics.\nThe vowel inventory of the Chinese dialects of Evenki, however, is markedly different (Chaoke, 1995, 2009):\nLike most Tungusic languages, Evenki employs vowel harmony—suffix vowels are matched to the vowel in the root. However, some vowels – – and certain suffixes do not adhere to the rules of vowel harmony. Knowledge of the rules of vowel harmony is fading, as vowel harmony is a complex topic for elementary speakers to grasp, the language is severely endangered (Janhunen), and many speakers are multilingual.\n\nPossible syllable structures include V, VC, VCC, CV, CVC, and CVCC. In contrast to dialects in Russia, dialects in China do not have /k/, /ŋ/, nor /r/ in word-initial position.\n\nThe creation of the Evenki alphabet began in the 1920s. In May 1928, researcher G. M. Vasilevich () prepared for the Evenk students who studied in Leningrad the “Memo to Tungus-vacationers”. It was a small textbook duplicated on the glass. It used the Vasilyevich Evenki alphabet on a Latin graphic basis. A year later, she compiled the “First Book for Reading in the Tungus Language” (\"Әwәnkil dukuwuntin\"). This alphabet had the following composition: \"Aa Bb HH Dd Ӡӡ Ee Әә Gg Hh Ii Kk Ll Mm Nn ​​Ŋŋ Oo Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Ww Yy\"; it also included the diacritical marks: a macron, to indicate the longitude of the sound, and a sub-letter comma, to indicate palatalization.\n\nIn 1930, it was decided to create a written language for the majority of the peoples of the North of the USSR. The Latin alphabet was chosen as its graphic basis. In the same year, the project of the Evenki alphabet was proposed by Ya. P. Alcor. This project differed from Vasilevich’s alphabet only by the presence of letters for displaying Russian borrowings (\"C c, F f, J j, W w, Z z\"), as well as using \"V v\" instead of \"W w\". After some refinement, the letter \"Ч\" was replaced by \"Ç ç\", \"V v\" by \"W w\", and the letter \"Y y\" was excluded. In May 1931, the Evenki romanized alphabet was officially approved, and in 1932 regular publishing began on it. The basis of the literary language was laid the most studied nepsky dialect (north of the Irkutsk region).\n\nThe official Latinized Evenk alphabet, in which book publishing and schooling were conducted, looked like this:\n\nToday, the official written language in Russia for the evenki language is Cyrillic script. The script has one additional letter, ӈ, to indicate /ŋ/; it is used only inconsistently in printed works, due to typographical limitations. Boldyrev's dictionary uses ң instead. Other sounds found in Evenki but not Russian, such as /dʒ/, lack devoted letters. Instead \"д\" stands in for both /d/ and /dʒ/; when the latter pronunciation is intended, it is followed by one of Cyrillic's iotified letters, similar to the way those letters cause palatalization of the preceding consonant in Russian. However orthographic decisions like these have resulted in some confusion and transfer of Russian phonetics to Evenki among younger speakers. For example, the spellings \"ди\" and \"ды\" were intended to record [dʒi] and [di] (i.e. the same vowel sound). However, in Russian \"и\" and \"ы\" are respectively two different vowels /i/ and /ɨ/. Long vowels are indicated with macrons.\n\nIn the \"Imperial History of the National Languages of Liao, Jin, and Yuan\" () commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor, the Manchu alphabet is used to write Evenki words.\n\nEvenki in China is now written in the Latin script and experimentally in the Mongolian script. Evenki scholars made an attempt in the 1980s to create standard written forms for their language, using both Mongolian script and a pinyin-like Latin spelling. They published an Evenki–Mongolian–Chinese dictionary () with Evenki words spelled in IPA, a pinyin-like orthography, and Mongolian script, as well as a collection of folk songs in IPA and Mongolian script (and Chinese-style numbered musical notation).\n\nThe orthographic system developed by Chinese Evenki scholars reflects differences between Evenki and Mongol phonology. It uses both and (usually romanised from Mongolian as \"q\" and \"ɣ\") for /g/. The system uses double letters in both Mongolian and Latin to represent most long vowels; however for /ɔː/ \"ao\" is written instead of \"oo\". The same scholars' collection of songs has some orthographic differences from the table below; namely, long vowels are occasionally written not just doubled but also with an intervening silent (\"ɣ\"), showing clear orthographic influence from the Mongolian language. In medial and final positions, \"t\" is written in the Manchu script form . \"Evenki\" itself is spelled \"eweŋki\", despite Mongolian orthography usually prohibiting the letter combination \"ŋk\". The vowel inventory of this system is also rather different from that of Chaoke (1995, 2009).\n\nEvenki is highly agglutinating, suffixing, and not flexive: Each morpheme is easily recognizable and carries only one piece of meaning. Evenki pronouns distinguish between singular and plural as well as inclusive and exclusive in the first person. The Evenki language has a rich case system—13 cases, though there is some variation among dialects—and it is a nominative–accusative language. Evenki differentiates between alienable and inalienable possession: alienable possession marks the possessor in the nominative case and the possessum in the possessed case, while inalienable possession is marked by personal indices.\n\nBelow is a table of cases and suffixes in Evenki, following Nedjalkov (1997):\nPlurals are marked with -il-, -l-, or -r- before the case marker, if any: \"tyge-l-ve\" (cup--) \"the cups (accusative);\" Ivul-ngi oro-r-in (Ivul- reindeer--), \"the reindeer (pl.) of Ivul.\"\n\nEvenki is a subject–object–verb and head-final language. The subject is marked according to the nominative case, and the object is in the accusative. In Evenki, the indirect object precedes the direct object.\n\nThe Manchu script was used to write Evenki (Solon) words in the \"Imperial History of the National Languages of Liao, Jin, and Yuan\". The Evenki did not have their own writing system until the introduction of the Latin script in 1931 and the subsequent change to Cyrillic in 1936-7. The literary language was first based on the Nepa dialect of the Southern subgroup, but in the 1950s was redesigned with the Stony Tunguska dialect as its basis. Ethnographer S. M. Shirokogoroff harshly criticised the \"child-like\" literary language, and in a 1930s monograph predicted it would quickly go extinct. Although textbooks through the 8th grade have been published, \"Literary Evenki has not yet achieved the status of a norm which cut across dialects and is understood by speakers of some dialects with great difficulty\". However, despite its failure to gain widespread acceptance, within its dialectal base of roughly 5,000 people, it survived and continues in use up to the present. Since the 1930s, \"folklore, novels, poetry, numerous translations from Russian and other languages\", textbooks, and dictionaries have all been written in Evenki. In Tura (former administrative center of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug), the local newspaper includes a weekly supplement written in Evenki.\n\nThere is a large quantity of Russian loan words in Evenki, especially for technologies and concepts that were introduced by the Russian pioneers in Siberia. \"Evenki is spoken in regions with heavy multilingualism. In their daily life the people come into contact with Russian, Buriat and Yakut, and each of these languages had affected the Evenki language. Russian is the lingua franca of the region, part of the Evenki population is bilingual, and part trilingual. All Evenki know Russian relatively well.\" In 1998 there were approximately 30,000 ethnic Evenkis living in Russia and about 1/3 of them spoke the language. Even a decade ago Bulatova was trying to warn speakers and linguists alike: \"There is widespread loss of Evenki and the language can be considered seriously endangered\". According to the 2002 Russian census, there are 35,527 citizens of the Russian Federation who identify themselves as ethnically Evenki, but only 7,580 speakers of the language.\n\nIn China, there is an ethnic population of 30,500 but only 19,000 are fluent in Evenki and there are only around 3,000 people who are monolingual in Evenki. Juha Janhunen investigated multilingualism in Hulunbuir (northern Inner Mongolia) and the adjoining section of Heilongjiang (e.g. Qiqihar) in 1996. He found that most Solons still spoke Evenki, and about half knew Daur language as well. Furthermore, Mongolian functioned as a \"lingua franca\" among members of all minority groups there, as they tended to do their education in Mongolian-medium schools. The only Evenki-speakers whom Janhunen knew not to speak Mongolian as a second language were the Reindeer Evenki (sometimes called \"Yakut\") in the northern part of Hulunbuir, who used Russian as their \"language of intercultural communication\". Janhunen predicted that all of these languages, including Mongolian, were likely to lose ground to Chinese in coming years. However Chaoke noted more than a decade later that the usage rate of Evenki remained quite high, and that it was still common to find Evenki-speakers who were proficient in three, four, or even five languages.\n\nThere is a small population of Mongolized Hamnigan speakers in Mongolia as well, numbering around 1,000.\n\nThere is little information regarding revival efforts or Evenki's status now. In 1998, the language was taught in preschools and primary schools and offered as an option in 8th grade. The courses were regarded as an 'ethnocultural component' to bring Evenki language and culture into the curriculum. Instruction as a second language is also available in the Institute of the Peoples of the North at Herzen University (the former St. Petersburg State Pedagogical University). In the 1980s, Christian missionaries working in Siberia translated the Bible into Evenki and a Christian group called the Global Recordings Network records Christian teaching materials in Evenki.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11446405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11446405", "title": "Joseph Breen", "text": "Joseph Breen\n\nJoseph Ignatius Breen (October 14, 1888 – December 5, 1965) was an American film censor with the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America who applied the Hays Code to film production.\n\nBreen was the youngest of three sons born to Mary and Hugh A. Breen in Philadelphia. His father had emigrated from Ireland and met his mother Mary in New Jersey. Breen was raised in a strict Roman Catholic home and attended Gesu Parish School until the eighth grade. He then attended Boys Catholic High School. He attended Saint Joseph's College but dropped out after two years, after which he worked as a newspaper reporter for fourteen years in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. After working as a reporter, Breen worked for the United States Foreign Service for four years, serving in Kingston, Jamaica, and in Toronto, Canada.\n\nBreen was a journalist and an \"influential layperson\" in the Catholic community. Breen worked for Will H. Hays as a \"troubleshooter\" as early as 1931. \n\nIn 1933, the Roman Catholic National Legion of Decency was founded, and began to rate films independently, putting pressure on the industry. In 1933 and 1934 the Legion along with a number of Protestant and women's groups launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral. The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) had, up until then, enforced the motion picture industry's own self-censorship standards, albeit not very seriously. Hays, who had been in charge of enforcing this voluntary code since 1927, worried that the NLD's efforts could weaken his own power and that of his office, and hurt industry profits. \n\nHays appointed the \"tough Irish Catholic\" Breen to head the Production Code Administration (PCA), a newly created department of the MPPDA, created to administer the Motion Picture Production Code. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions became binding — no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA. Any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000. \n\nAfter ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide production code was enforced starting on July 1, 1934. \"Liberty Magazine\" wrote in 1936 that Breen's appointment gave him \"more influence in standardizing world thinking than Mussolini, Hitler, or Stalin.\"\n\nBreen has been accused of anti-Semitism because of a few personal letters he wrote in the early 1930s. In these letters, he lamented the immorality of the filmmakers. According to author Thomas Doherty, this outburst was likely a reaction to Breen's sudden immersion in the alien Hollywood culture rather than an expression of deeply held beliefs, stating that \"The antisemitic bile erupted during the pre-Code era, when Breen, newly arrived in Hollywood, was shocked by the folkways of the locals and anguished by his inability to purify the screen.\" After 1934, he was \"publicly and forthrightly anti-antisemitic.\"\n\nWilliam Dudley Pelley, founder of the anti-Semitic organization the Silver Legion of America, believed that Jews controlled the movie industry, which he thought to be the \"most effective propaganda medium in America\", during the 1930s. Hence he applauded the fact that Breen had assumed the power to censor Hollywood. Breen, who also expressed anti-Semitic views, was deeply worried that Jewish filmmakers would try to use Nazi mistreatment of Jews during the 1930s as a vehicle for propaganda. He was concerned that Germans would be offended by harsh depiction of Nazis. He specifically warned Hollywood producers to avoid the topic altogether, saying that \"[t]here is a strong pro-German and anti-Semitic feeling in this country ... and while those who are likely to approve of an anti-Hitler picture may think well of such an enterprise, they should keep in mind that millions of Americans might think otherwise.\" Breen claimed that plans to make such pictures were being coordinated through the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, which he claimed was \"conducted and financed almost entirely by Jews\". As a result of Breen's anticommunist views, the censorship board pressured Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to drop plans to film Sinclair Lewis's anti-fascist novel, \"It Can't Happen Here\".\n\nIn 1938, largely in response to Nazi activities in Germany, Pope Pius XI denounced anti-Semitism, stating that \"it is not possible for Christians to take part in anti-Semitism\". In response to this encouragement, American Roman Catholics formed the Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism. The two authors of the Hays Code, Martin J. Quigley and the Rev. Daniel Lord, SJ, promoted the cause. Quigley asked Breen to help gather statements of support from Catholics in the Hollywood film industry. Breen did so, and issued a statement himself, which said, in part, \"In my judgement there is nothing more important for us Catholics to do at the present moment [July 1939] than to use our energies in stemming the tide of racial bigotry and hostility.\"\n\nBreen retired from the PCA in April 1941, announcing that his departure was due to overwork and exhaustion. Between 1941 and 1942 Breen was the general manager of RKO Pictures. He returned to the PCA in 1942.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Breen's power over Hollywood was diminishing. For instance, Samuel Goldwyn publicly insisted that the production code be revised. Around the same time, Howard Hughes, owner of RKO, released \"The French Line\", featuring revealing images of actress Jane Russell in a bathing suit, despite the fact that Breen had refused to approve the picture for release.\n\nIn 1951, Breen's office refused to approve Otto Preminger's film \"The Moon Is Blue\" because of objections to the dialogue. United Artists backed Preminger in his decision to release the movie without Breen's approval.\n\nIn 1954, the same year he retired, in responding to these events in an interview with Aline Mosby, Breen claimed that \"[A]fter the events of the past 10 months — \"The French Line\", \"The Moon is Blue\" and Goldwyn — the code is more entrenched than ever before. Those events brought tremendous support from groups all over the country.\" Breen retired from the PCA and was replaced by Geoffrey Shurlock. On his retirement he was presented with an honorary Academy Award for \"his conscientious, open-minded and dignified management of the Motion Picture Production Code\".\n\nBreen married Mary Dervin in February 1914, with whom he had six children, three boys and three girls. Their son Joseph Breen, Jr. was a writer and director. One of their other children, Thomas, whose right leg was amputated due to a combat injury on Guam during World War II, was cast in a feature role in Jean Renoir's 1950 film \"The River\", playing a wounded war veteran. Renoir was not aware at the time that Thomas was Joseph Breen's son.\n\nAfter his retirement, Breen moved to Phoenix, Arizona with his wife Mary. He suffered from poor health in his later years and eventually lost the use of his legs. He died at the age of 77 on December 5, 1965, at the Brentwood Convalescent Home in Los Angeles and was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City.\n\nAfter Breen's death, \"Variety\" magazine wrote that Breen was \"one of the most influential figures in American culture\" and that \"more than any single individual, he shaped the moral stature of the American motion picture.\" The trade magazine went on to say that Breen enforced the PCA code \"with a potent mix of missionary zeal and administrative tenacity.\"\n\nIn the 2004 film \"The Aviator\", Breen was portrayed by Edward Herrmann.\n\n"}

At an early age Spindler decided to go to sea rather than join the family business, serving for a period as a watch officer on a Lloyd line steamship. He subsequently enlisted in the marine school in Bremen and the naval academy in Sonderburg, then part of Germany. He served on several ships of the German Imperial Navy and at the outbreak of the Great War, he was commanding the Polarstern, a guardship for the port of Wilhelmshaven.\n\nOn 20 March 1916 Spindler was given instructions by his senior officer to undertake a highly secret and dangerous mission on board a disguised merchant ship and to pick five officers and a crew of 16 to join him on the journey. He was given command of a vessel named \"Libau\", a captured British vessel formerly named \"Castro\" and informed that it was to be falsely flagged as a Norwegian freighter and carry a cargo of weapons to the West Coast of Ireland along with a passenger, Sir Roger Casement. It was part of a plan to land German arms in Ireland to assist Irish republicans in staging what would become the 1916 Rising. Spindler travelled to Berlin for further orders and met Casement there. However Casement preferred to travel on board a submarine which would accompany the \"Libau\" which was to be renamed the \"Aud\", the name of a real Norwegian ship, once it went to sea. Casement was later put ashore at Banna Strand in Co. Kerry from the submarine by means of a small collapsible boat. However Casement was arrested soon afterwards on Good Friday, 21 April 1916, and taken prisoner in the Tower of London on charges of High Treason against the United Kingdom. He was subsequently executed by hanging at Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916. The uprising had failed. Meanwhile, Spindler's ship, now renamed the \"Aud\", was intercepted by British naval vessels near the Blasket Islands and forced to sail for Cobh (then known as Queenstown) where the British had a major naval base. However Spindler instructed his crew to open the ship's sea-valves and blow an explosive charge in the hold. As they left the sinking ship the crew took down the false Norwegian flag she was flying and hoisted the German Imperial flag in its place. They then left the vessel on board two dinghies and were taken prisoners by the British. After some questioning they were taken as prisoners of war to Donington Hall. From there they later escaped only to be recaptured the following day. Spindler was in a weakened state after several bouts of ill-health, and in a prisoner exchange shortly before the end of the war he was transferred to the Netherlands. He subsequently travelled to the United States where he went on a lecture tour speaking of his ill-fated trip to Ireland and his connections with the Easter Rising. In 1921 Spindler published a book on the \"Aud\" episode which was translated into English as \"The mystery of the Casement ship\" or \"The Mystery Ship\" and had significant sales and was translated into several languages. He was feted by Irish-American groups in the US and received numerous awards.\n\nAlthough he made several returns to Germany to see his family, Spindler remained in the United States for the rest of his life. During World War II he was detained in an internment camp as an enemy alien as he failed to get permanent residency or naturalization in the US. He was released in poor health at the end of that war. Karl Spindler died on 29 November 1951 in Bismarck, North Dakota.\n"}

She was the wife of spy Morris Cohen.\n\nLona Cohen was born Leontine Theresa Petka in Adams, Massachusetts, the daughter of Polish Catholic immigrants. An American citizen, she was a member of the Communist Party USA and had been recruited into Soviet espionage in 1939 by her husband, Morris. She worked for Soviet case officers, including Anatoli Yatskov, out of the New York \"rezidentura\" during World War II.\n\nAfter her husband was drafted in 1942, Cohen ran a network that included engineers and technicians at munitions and aviation plants in the New York area. One of her sources smuggled a working model of a new machine gun out of a munitions plant. She worked at two defense plants, the Public Metal Company in New York City in 1941 and the Aircraft Screw Products plant on Long Island in 1943.\n\nShe was a courier who picked up reports from Theodore Hall, and a source cover named \"FOGEL\" and \"PERS\" from the American secret atomic weapons project at Los Alamos, New Mexico and carried them to the Soviet consulate in New York, where a KGB sub-residency under a young engineer, Leonid R. Kvasnikov, coordinated operations and dispatched intelligence to Moscow.\n\nAfter the defections of Elizabeth Bentley and Igor Gouzenko, the Cohens ended contact with Soviet intelligence until 1949, at which time they began working with Col. Rudolph Abel, a U.S. based illegal resident. After Klaus Fuchs was arrested in the United Kingdom in 1950, Cohen and her husband fled to Moscow, where she received additional training as a radio operator and cipher clerk. In 1954, the pair resurfaced in London under the names Helen and Peter Kroger with New Zealand passports. They set up an antiquarian book business which was cover for their activities of running the London Illegal Rezidentura. Gordon Lonsdale worked with them as part of the Portland Spy Ring.\n\nWhile in London, the Cohens were friends with Frank and Nora Doel. Frank Doel is the bookseller whose correspondence with the author Helene Hanff became the bestseller, \"84 Charing Cross Road\". In her follow-up book, \"The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street\", Hanff reported an anecdote told her by Nora Doel. One New Year's Eve, the Doels gave a party at which Lona Cohen (aka Helen Kroger):\n\narrived looking very exotic in a long black evening dress. 'Helen, you look like a Russian spy!' said Nora. And Helen laughed and Peter laughed and a few months later Nora picked up the morning paper and discovered that Helen and Peter Kruger \"were\" Russian spies.\n\n In the basement of their house, at 45 Cranley Drive, Ruislip, situated not far from the military airfield of Northolt, they set up a high speed radio transmitter and began sending Moscow \"information of special importance\". In January 1961, they were arrested for espionage, and in March, she received a sentence of 20 years while her husband got 25 years, of which they served only eight, until in 1969, the two were finally exchanged with the Soviet Union for a British subject called Gerald Brooke.\n\nBefore being taken in custody, Mrs. Kroger had asked permission to stoke up the boiler. Before she could do so, Detective Superintendent Smith, a veteran \"spy catcher\" who was in charge of the arrest, insisted on checking her handbag first. It was found to contain microdots, the photographic reduction of documents, in order to make them small enough to be smuggled out of the country more easily.\n\n In 1941, Cohen married Morris Cohen, who recruited her to his espionage activities.\n\nCohen died in Moscow on December 23, 1992.\n\nLona Cohen was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and Order of Friendship of Nations by the Soviet Union.\n\nOnce in Moscow, the Cohens continued training colleagues for illegal intelligence operations.\nIn 1983, the British playwright Hugh Whitemore dramatized the case as \"Pack of Lies\", which was performed in London's West End theatre district starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams. It played on Broadway for 3½ months in 1985, for which Rosemary Harris won the best actress Tony award for her portrayal of the British neighbor of the Cohens/Krogers. It was made into a TV movie starring Ellen Burstyn, Alan Bates, Teri Garr and Daniel Benzali (as \"Peter Schaefer,\" i.e., \"Peter Kroger,\" i.e., Morris Cohen) which aired in the U.S. on CBS in 1987. The plot centered on the neighbors (and seeming friends) whose house was used as a base from which the security services could spy on the Cohens, and the way paranoia, suspicion and betrayal gradually destroyed their lives during that time.\n\nThe Cohens' cover as antiquarian book dealers Peter and Helen Kroger is mentioned in Helene Hanff's \"The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street\" because they were friends of London book dealer Frank Doel, recipient of the letters and book orders that inspired the bestseller \"84 Charing Cross Road\".\n\n"}

This connection may be residential, legal, historical, or cultural. For most Malaysians, several (frequently all) of those types of connections exist and are the source(s) of their being considered Malaysians. Although citizens make up the majority of Malaysians, non-citizen residents and overseas Malaysians may also claim a Malaysian identity.\n\nThe country is home to people of various national, ethnic and religious origins. As a result, many Malaysians do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance to Malaysia. Majority of the population, however, belong to several clearly defined ethnolinguistic groups within the country with their own distinct cultures and traditions: Malays, Orang Asli (aboriginal population), Malaysian Chinese (primarily Han Chinese), Malaysian Indians (primarily Tamils). Malays themselves are the source of the name \"Malaysia\" (\"land of Malays\") as they traditionally formed the majority during the British rule. The majority of the non-Malay and non-aboriginal population in modern Malaysia is made up of immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of Portuguese, Dutch and then significantly longer British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-aboriginal peoples took place over the course of nearly five centuries and continue today.\n\nMalayan independence from United Kingdom in 1957 grew gradually over the course of latter part of the 20th century since the formation of the Federation of Malaya in 1948 (excluding Crown Colony of Singapore, Crown Colony of North Borneo and Crown Colony of Sarawak). World War II in particular gave rise to a desire amongst Malayans to have their country recognised as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship.\n\nAs of 2010, Malaysians make up 0.4% of the world's total population, having relied upon immigration for population growth and social development. Approximately 30% of current Malaysians are first- or second-generation immigrants, and 20 percent of Malaysian residents in the 2000s were not born in Malaysian soil. It is estimated, by 2031, nearly one-half of Malaysians above the age of 15 will be foreign born or have one foreign born parent. Bumiputera, according to the 2010 Malaysian Census, numbered at 17,523,508 or 61.85% of the country's 28,334,135 population.\n\nClassification of 2010 Census ethnic group is as set by Inter-Agency Technical Committee (IATC) in Appendix 1. IATC is a committee formed to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation and use of standardised codes, classifications and definitions used by the Department of Statistics, Malaysia and other government agencies. For the purpose of tabulation and analysis, as well as taking into account the diverse ethnic group in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Federal Territory of Labuan and Sarawak, major ethnic groups according to region as follows:\n\nInformation collected in the census including ethnic group and citizenship was based on respondent's answer and did not refer to any official document.\n\nInformation on citizenship should be used with caution as it is subject to content and coverage errors especially for non-citizens as in censuses in most countries.\n\nMalaysia contains speakers of 137 living languages, 41 of which are found in Peninsula Malaysia. Malaysian, or Standard Malay, is the official language, while English is considered the de facto language for business. The Bumiputeras speak various Austronesian and Austroasiatic languages as well as smaller language families such as Tai-Kadai and Creoles. Chinese Malaysians predominantly speak varieties of Chinese from the southern provinces of China. The more common varieties in the country are Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, and Fuzhou. Tamil is the predominant among Indian Malaysians, though languages like Telugu, Malayalam and Punjabi are also spoken.\n\nThe Malaysian constitution guarantees freedom of religion while making Islam the state religion. According to the Population and Housing Census 2010 figures, ethnicity and religious beliefs correlate highly. Approximately 61.3% of the population practice Islam, 19.8% practice Buddhism, 9.2% Christianity, 6.3% Hinduism and 1.3% practice Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions. 0.7% declared no religion and the remaining 1.4% practised other religions or did not provide any information.\n"}

She is also responsible for many of the power plants built in Yugoslavia, which helped rebuild the country's economy after the Second World War. Known for her modernist approach, she is one of the first women in Serbia to undertake large scale architectural projects.\n\nŠterić was born in Smederevo, Serbia and studied architecture in Belgrade, graduating in 1937. Once World War 2 was over, she was hired by Elektroistok in 1947. She then worked at Energoprojekt from 1951 until 1985, where she became their chief architect. She initially focused on constructing industrial and infrastructural buildings for both companies, designing several power plants throughout Yugoslavia. Her first thermal power plant was built in Kostolac in 1948 and was called \"Mali Kostolac\". She went on to construct \"Kolubara A\" in Veliki Crljeni in 1956. She also built the \"Kakanj\" plant near Zenica and the \"Velenje\" plant in Slovenia.\n\nIn 1957, Šterić spent half a year in the Netherlands working at the architectural firm \"Van den Broek and Bakeme\" where she learnt more about the Bauhaus style. After returning to Serbia, she applied her new skills and built a commercial building on Carice Milice 2 street. Constructed in 1957, the building's facade is a combination of steel and glass, underscored by horizontal bands of windows. Just down the road, Šterić also built the headquarters of Energoprojekt in 1960, which later became the Beobank building. It was the first structure in Belgrade with free standing pillars and a transparent glass facade. Several housing projects in Bor, Bijeljina, Kladovo, Smederevo, and Herceg Novi were designed by her in the 1960s, as well as a power station in New Belgrade. From the 1970s onwards, she was responsible for the construction of various public buildings in Smederevo, such as a department store, a children's institution, and cultural center.\n\nŠterić participated in international competitions, winning several contracts. During the 1970s, she co-designed the ministerial building in Kanou, Nigeria, along with fellow architect Zoran Bojović. She also built the Cimpata military settlement in Zambia and co-designed a Bedouin settlement in Kuwait consisting of 5,000 houses.\n\nIn 1984, Šterić received the \"Grand prix d'architecture\" from the \"Union of Architects of Serbia\". In 1994, she was a member of the committee that created the \"Academy of Architecture of Serbia\" the following year. In 2015, the \"Belgrade International Architecture Week\" festival organized a walking tour of Belgrade buildings that were constructed by women architects such as Šterić. That same year, she was one of several female pioneers reviewed in the book \"Women in Architecture - Contemporary architecture in Serbia since 1900\".\n\nŠterić's Beobank building will be transformed into an eco-center sometime in 2018. Located in the Zeleni Venac neighbourhood, the structure won her the \"Sedmojulska nagrada\" (\"7th Prize award for architecture\") when it was built. In 2018, Šterić and other Yugoslav architects will be the focus of an exhibition at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called \"Towards Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980\".\n\n"}

The term also describes the related music genre, which is sometimes also referred to as hatecore. Nazi Punk music generally sounds like other forms of punk rock, but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some ethnic minorities, Jews, homosexuals,anarchists, and other perceived enemies. \n\nIt is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the anti-authoritarian ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture. While early punks including Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux incorporated Nazi imagery such as Swastikas, this has commonly been interpreted as an attempt to shock, rather than as a genuine belief in principles of Nazism. In the long-standing band The Exploited, Wattie Buchan has been regularly questioned about his swastika tattoo and he has constantly denied being a racist.\n\nIn 1978 in Britain, the white nationalist National Front had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front. Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several English punks, as well as forming a number of white power punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss. In the early 1980s, the white power skinhead band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band. They said they did that in the hopes of getting public concerts booked easier, but this tactic did not work, and they soon returned to being a racist skinhead band.\n\nThe Nazi Punk subculture appeared in the United States by the early 1980s in the hardcore punk scene.\n\n\n\n"}

His father, Cicerone Mokhehle, was the headman of the village and one of the early Basotho Inspector of Schools. He was admitted to Fort Hare University, Transkei in 1940 where he studied science. He published articles in the Basotho newspaper \"Mochochonono\" and later involved in protesting activities which led to his expulsion from the university in 1942. Mokhehle joined the Lekhotla la Bafo during his time in Lesotho.

He fought colonial rule in Lesotho and demanded greater self-rule. He also founded the influential \"Mohlabani (The Warrior)\" and \"Makatolle\" political newspapers. His outspoken political views caused him to be dismissed from his teaching position at Basutoland High School in 1954.

Hill\n\nPaul Richard Hill (1909–1990) was a renowned mid–twentieth-century American aerodynamicist. He was a leading research and development engineer and manager for NASA (National Aeronautical and Space Administration) and its predecessor, NACA (the National Advisory Council for Aeronautics) between 1939 and 1970, retiring as Associate Chief, Applied Materials and Physics Division at the NASA Langley Research Centre. He is arguably most widely known today as the author of \"Unconventional Flying Objects: a Scientific Analysis\".\n\nHill was born in Odebolt, Iowa in February 1909. After graduating with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from University of California, Berkeley in 1936 he was Professor of Aeronautics at the Polytechnic College of Engineering in Oakland, California for three years before joining the National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics (NACA) in 1939. He continued to work in a range of senior R&D management roles when NACA became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 at the NASA Langley Research Center. Hill was married to Frances Hoback Hill (d. 1999). They had one daughter, Julie M. Hill. Paul Richard Hill died on April 9, 1990 in the James River Regional Convalescent Centre, Newport News, Virginia, USA.\n\nThe Paul R Hill Special Collection is held by the Archives of American Aerospace. He was awarded NASA's Exceptional Service Medal in 1969. This award was \"… granted for significant achievement or service characterized by unusual initiative or creative ability that clearly demonstrates substantial improvement in engineering, space flight, or space-related endeavors which contribute to NASA programs\". In 1970 Hill received a citation for outstanding scientific leadership for \"directing research applicable to space laboratories and other spacecraft.\"\n\nDuring the second world war Hill co-authored a number of technical NACA papers, focusing on aerodynamic aspects of aircraft performance. Hill was also involved in NACA collaboration with the Republic Aircraft Company, assisting in the design of the highly successful P-47 fighter. Hill's specific role was in the aerodynamic design. In the immediate post war period Hill made a number of significant contributions to the development of ram jet technology, including establishing and supervising the Wallops Island ram jet test flight programme and authoring the first NACA technical paper on ram jet technology.\n\nBy the early 1950s, in part inspired by his personal interest in the 'flying saucer' or 'UFO' phenomenon, Hill began experimenting in his own time with kinesthetically controlled flying platforms. This led to an official project, which Hill initiated with Charles Zimmerman, who had been independently working on similar concepts for some time. This project designed and test flew such platforms in collaboration with the United States Air Force, the Royal Canadian Airforce and the US Office of Naval Research. The increased understanding of the aerodynamic and performance characteristics of such platforms informed future design work for the Lunar Landing Module (LM), other VTOL designs and experiments with disc shaped aircraft in the period.\n\nIn the early 1950s Hill was part of a specially-assembled advisory panel of \"great men\"; aerodynamicists advising Sandia Labs on problems encountered with the design of the second generation bombs (H Bombs). In addition to Hill, who at this time headed NACA's Pilotless Aircraft Division, the \"great men\" listed by Dr Robert F Brodsky of Sandia Labs in his memoir were Jack Northrop (founder of Northrop Aircraft), George Schairer (Chief of aerodynamics at Boeing), Ira H. Abbott (\"a legendary engineer\"), Ed Heinemann (Chief engineer Douglas Aircraft), Dr. Alex Charters (\"a famous ballistician\"), Al Sibilia (Vought aircraft chief of aerodynamics), Dr. Charles Poor (Chief Scientist Army's Ballisic Research Laboratory), and \"several other distinguished engineers\". It was Hill and Charters, however, whom Brodsky called the \"heroes\". Hill's specific contribution was in diagnosing the aerodynamic problems in the bomb design, though Brodsky acknowledges that at the time they were ignored until a year later when the Sandia scientists realized they were right. \"Both experts were correct, but they were too far ahead of us technically\".\n\nIn 1956 the US Air Force established project HYWARDS, with the aim of developing a hypersonic design capable of up to Mach 12, as a successor to the X-15. The aerospace historian, James Hansen notes that a number of NACA engineers later joined the initial HYWARDS study group at Langley Research Centre \"notably Paul Hill, configuration and propulsion…\". Hill made a number of important contributions, particularly in the design of hypersonic wind tunnels.\n\nBy 1959 Hill became involved in research for a future lunar mission. A lunar study group was established under the leadership of Clint Brown who asked for the participation of six of \"Langley's most thoughtful analysts: David Adamson, Supersonic Aerodynamics Division; Paul R. Hill, PARD; John C. Houbolt, Dynamic Loads Division; Albert A. Schy, Stability Research Division; Samuel Katzoff, Full-Scale Research Division; and Bill Michael of his own Theoretical Mechanics Division\". This was one of many study groups to examine a lunar mission during the period, with arguably its major contribution being in initiating the concept of rendezvous in orbit between a lander and a main spacecraft.\".\n\nSpace station research began in earnest at NASA-Langley in the early 1960s and Hill played a prominent role. The historian James Hansen describes Hill as one of two \" key members of Langley's early space station research\" (along with Robert Osborne), with again much of Hill's pioneering work feeding into later developments.\n\n\"Of all those who contributed to the Moon decision, the ones farthest in the background were the engineers of Langley and Goddard and Marshall, many of whom devoted their lives to spaceflight, designing dreams ...\".\n\nHill maintained a long-term interest in Unidentified Flying Objects. He had two personal UFO sightings. The first, on July 16, 1952, was with his future wife, Frances Hoback, and was reported to the USAF Blue Book project. This sighting was officially classified as aeroplanes as a flight of bombers were in the area. The then head of Blue Book, Captain (later Major) Edward Ruppelt was later to write of the case, however,\n\n\"The only possible solution to the sighting was that the two men (sic) had seen airplanes. We investigated this report and found that there were several B-26's from Langley AFB in the area at the time of the sighting, but none of the B-26 pilots remembered being over Hampton Roads. In fact, all of them had generally stayed well south of Norfolk until about 10:30P.M. because of thunderstorm activity northwest of Langley. Then there were other factors - the observers heard no sound and they were away from all city noises, aircraft don't carry just one or two amber lights, and the distance between the two lights was such that had they been on an airplane the airplane would have been huge or very close to the observers. And last, but not least, the man from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was a very famous aerodynamicist and of such professional stature that if he said the lights weren't airplanes they weren't.\"\n\nHill's second personal UFO sighting, in 1962, was not reported to Blue Book, but is described in his book.\n\nHill was a strong proponent of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, which suggests that some UFOs represent structural craft of extraterrestrial origin. After retiring from NASA he developed his analysis with the aim of demonstrating that those UFOs that are not misidentifications of mundane objects or phenomena, have a coherent and consistent set of performance characteristics that are in line with what is allowable within physical theory. Hill presented his case within his book, \"Unconventional Flying Objects: A Scientific Analysis\". The book was published posthumously, following a number of rejections from publishers during Hill's lifetime.\n\n\"Unconventional Flying Objects\" was well received by the ufology community and is widely referenced by authors interested in UFOs.\nIn an interview in 2000 Hill's daughter, Julie, described her father's interest in psi research:\n\n\"He spoke about a friend who was a psychic and experiments they did. He said he set up a pinwheel experiment – I don't know how, but he knew how to set up an experiment that would be valid – and he told me that for about a week he could turn it with his mind, with his thoughts, but after about a week he couldn't do it anymore. He also told me a story about being in a car parked on the street, he was into thought experiments, and he said he projected a thought into her mind to get into my car, and as the woman was walking by the car she stopped, opened the door and sat down and looked at him, and I don't know if she shrieked or what but she was absolutely stunned at what she was doing. He said, I willed her to get into the car, and she did. I think he was as shocked as she was. They were both shocked.\nHe told me when I was in my late teens, and this was before Shirley Maclaine and astral projection, that when he slept, he could float out of his body at night and float on the ceiling and look down and watch himself sleep. He never said he went anywhere or saw fantastic things, just that he left his body and watched himself sleep\".\n\nNone of these experiments were subject to peer review or published in any other way, however.\n"}

He has 40 books and two films to his credit.\n\nHe served as the President of Goa Konkani Akademi (Goa Academy of Letters for Konkani) of the Government of Goa since 2002. His novel \"Acchev\" (The Upheaval, 1977) and the first Konkani novel to be translated into English, is considered a landmark in the history of the language. It is a story based in a Goa wrecked by rampant mining.\n\n\"Acchev\" has been described as a novel which \"describes peasant life in the Ponda [sub-]district and shows what happens when a traditional society that lives by myths and rituals comes into contact with modern mechanised ways of life.\"\n\nManohar Shetty, in a review in the \"Deccan Herald\", writes: \"Pundalik Naik's novel is set in this grim backdrop, chronicling in detail the decay of a self-sufficient agricultural community with the impassive invasion of the mining industry. Naik's novel, the first to be translated from Konkani, created something of a sensation when it appeared in 1977. No other writer in Goa had portrayed in such graphic and brutal detail the ruinous fallouts on small agricultural holdings by the bulldozers of big industry. Pandhari, the protagonist of the novel, is the first to fall into the tempting shaft. Just before the auspicious day of sowing, Babuso, a wily and unscrupulous go-between, approaches him for his services as a load-bearer and to hire his bullock-cart to carry ore from the mines. Pandhari succumbs to the allure of quick money and in an instant becomes a bonded labourer and the bullocks, which once ploughed the life-sustaining fields, become a transport vehicle, the cart laden with the metallic spoils of the pillaged land.\"\n\nHe was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in Konkani for his work, \"Chowrang\", in 1984, by Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters. He was awarded the \"Gomant Sharda Puraskar\" for Lifetime Achievement in 2010.\n\nIn all, Naik has 32 plays, and collections of short stories, novels, no uvellas, translations and books of children's rhyme to his credit. He is considered a pioneer in the realm of Konkani drama.\n\nSome of his plays are as follows:\n\nSome have complained that \"his works are pretty difficult to bring into English and other languages\". There is also an essay (translated into English by Vidya Pai) explaining how Naik's \"Acchev\" happened. This essay (in Konkani) was originally published in the special issue of the Konkani literary magazine \"Jaag\" released to celebrate 150 years of the Konkani novel in early 2012.\n\nDuring a five-day theatre festival on the plays of Pundalik Naik, called \"Natyarang Pancham\", held in 2011, the plays staged were \"Shabay Shabay Bhaujan Samaj\", \"Kaansulo\", \"Suring\", \"Chaityanak Math Naa\" and \"Shree Vichitrachi Jatra\".\n\nNaik took to writing plays in 1977. The Shubham Naik Trust and the Directorate of Art and Culture had organised a festival of selected Konkani plays of Pundalik Naik at five regional centers including Masordem—Sattari, Mandrem—Pernem, Sanguem, Chaudi—Canacona and Shiroda—Ponda.\n\nNaik was born on 21 April 1952, in Volvoi village of Ponda taluka of Goa. He started his career as a schoolteacher (1972–78), joined All India Radio, Panjim, as a sub-editor in 1979, and later worked there as an assistant editor in charge of scripts. In 1984, he left All India Radio to become a full-time writer, and has 32 plays to his credit. He is married to Hema Naik, also a Konkani writer. He played a prominent role in the Konkani-Marathi linguistic controversy (1985–87) in Goa. He was the Convenor of the Konkani Porjecho Avaz, a campaign group promoting the cause of Konkani at the time.\n\nNaik has also written plays for radio and television, and has edited films.\n\nHe has edited an anthology, \"Chowrang\", for which he got the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1984. Besides, he has been bestowed the AIR's Playwright Award (1986, 1987), the Paters Award of the Australian Academy of Broadcasting and Science (1988), the Government of Goa award for children's drama (1975), and the Konkani Bhasha Mandal Prize. In 2013, the Sangeet Natak Akademi award came on account of his contribution to Indian theatre as a playwright.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a leader in the Winnebago War against the United States. He was for many years one of the most friendly and trusted of the Wisconsin Native Americans. In the late 1820s Red Bird and his followers began to grow uneasy over the encroachments of lead miners on Ho-Chunk land. The tribe was also disturbed by the mistaken belief that two Ho-Chunk had been put to death at Fort Snelling in 1826 for a murder they did not commit. Near Prairie du Chien on June 28, 1827, Red Bird and three companions followed the Indian code of revenge and under the influence of liquor murdered Registre Gagnier and Solomon Lipcap and seriously injured Gagnier's infant daughter. They fled after Gagnier's wife and son escaped and gave the alarm in Prairie du Chien.\n\nOn June 30, 1827, a band of Ho-Chunk fired on the Wisconsin River keelboat \"Oliver Perry\" killing two of the crew and wounding several others. With an Indian war threatening, the militia was mobilized and Federal troops were dispatched to Prairie du Chien from Jefferson Barracks, Mo. To avert a general war, Red Bird and his companions surrendered at Portage on Sept. 2, 1827. Although the chief expected the dignity of being put to death, he was instead taken to Prairie du Chien where he died in prison, Feb. 16, 1828. Several months later the other Indians were pardoned. One of the most dramatic incidents in Wisconsin history, the surrender of the proud and handsome chief became the subject of stories, paintings, and plays.\n\n\n"}

The statue and its basin date to the Nara period and have been designated National Treasures.\n\nThe birth of Shaka, the historical Buddha (Sanskrit: Siddhārtha Gautama or Śākyamuni), is one of the eight major events in the life of the Buddha that formed a popular subject for artistic representation. While Māyā was walking in the Lumbinī gardens and had stopped to pick flowers, the Buddha is said to have emerged from her right side. According to the \"Dīrghāgama Sūtra\", the young prince immediately took seven steps in the four directions and declared \"in the Heavens and on Earth, only I am the Venerable One\". The \"Lalitavistara\" relates that the infant was then bathed by two nāga, Nanda and Upananda, serpent deities or Dragon Kings.\n\nThe \"Sutra on the meritorious action of bathing the Buddha's image\" was translated into Chinese in 710. Reenacting the legend of the Buddha's birth, the annual rite known as \"kanbutsu-e\" (\"rite of sprinkling the Buddha\", more popularly \"hana matsuri\" or \"flower festival\") sees the bathing of small Buddha statues amidst garlands of flowers. Perfumed water was once used but, since the nineteenth century, this has generally been replaced by sweet hydrangea tea known as \"amacha\". Another variant sees the image repeatedly wiped with a silk cloth rather than anointed.\n\nCelebrations of the Buddha's birth have been staged in Japan on the eighth day of the fourth month since Empress Suiko ordered that vegetarian feasts should be held in all the temples in 606. \"Kanbutsu-e\" or \"sprinkling\" ceremonies are known to have been held at the Seiryōden, led by a priest from Gangō-ji, in 840 and the \"Engi shiki\" lists the utensils used at these Palace ceremonies. Earlier temple records and inventories of their treasures list \"kanbutsuzō\" or \"images for sprinkling\" at Hōryū-ji and Daian-ji, and early surviving examples include one dating to the Asuka period at in Aichi Prefecture (Important Cultural Property). This example at Tōdai-ji is generally dated to the 750s.\n\nAt Tōdai-ji today, a is erected each year before the Daibutsuden (Great Buddha Hall). This National Treasure Shaka at Birth was still used in the ceremony when Langdon Warner was writing in the late 1950s and indeed as late as the 1980s. More recently it has been replaced with a copy.\n\nEvoking the legend of his birth, the statue of the infant Buddha has its right arm raised, pointing to heaven, and left arm pendant, pointing to the earth; he is bare chested and wears a skirt. The elongated earlobes and spiral-shaped curls of hear, resembling snail-shells, are among the eighty secondary physical characteristics of the Buddha. The deep ridges on both body and arms \"emphasize the fleshiness\" of the smiling child's body. The soft, rounded, \"sweet-faced\" features of the young Buddha have been likened to those of the celestial musicians on the roughly contemporary octagonal lantern erected in front of the Tōdai-ji Daibutsuden. The original pedestal on which the image stands has been lost and replaced with a small wooden base carved with lotus petals.\n\nLike the statue, the basin or \"kanbutsuban\" is the largest of its type known. The exterior has incised images of human figures, animals real and imaginary, birds, and butterflies, set against a landscape of flowers, grasses, shrubs, trees, mountain peaks, clouds, and pagodas. Images of hermits with banners riding on birds, barbarians in foreign garb astride Chinese lions, and hunters chasing tigers are similar to motifs found on metalwork in Tōdai-ji's celebrated repository the Shōsōin. Much of this decoration is secular rather than Buddhist in inspiration. Like the statue, the basin shows the influence of contemporary Tang China.\n\nBoth statue and basin are of gilt bronze, cast using the lost-wax method. The statue was cast in one piece, other than for the right forearm which is a restoration; the join is clearly visible. Pieces of the clay core were left inside after casting. The decorative motifs on the outside of the basin were engraved and the background of dots hammered with a burin in the technique known as . Both statue and bowl are recognized as masterpieces of eighth-century metalwork.\n\n"}

{"id": "16802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16802", "title": "The Katzenjammer Kids", "text": "The Katzenjammer Kids\n\nThe Katzenjammer Kids is an American comic strip created by Rudolph Dirks in 1897, and later drawn by Harold Knerr for 35 years (1914 to 1949). It debuted December 12, 1897, in the \"American Humorist\", the Sunday supplement of William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Journal\". Dirks was the first cartoonist to regularly express dialogue in comic characters through the use of speech balloons. The comic strip was turned into a stage play in 1903. It inspired several animated cartoons and was one of 20 strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of U.S. commemorative postage stamps.\n\nAfter a series of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Dirks left the Hearst organization and began a new strip, first titled Hans and Fritz and then The Captain and the Kids. It featured the same characters seen in \"The Katzenjammer Kids\", which was continued by Knerr. The two separate versions of the strip competed with each other until 1979, when \"The Captain and the Kids\" ended its six-decade run. \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" published its last strip on January 1, 2006, but is still distributed in reprints by King Features Syndicate, making it the oldest comic strip still in syndication and the longest-running ever.\n\n\"The Katzenjammer Kids\" was inspired by \"Max and Moritz\", a children's story of the 1860s by German author Wilhelm Busch. \n\n\"Katzenjammer\" translates literally as \"the wailing of cats\" (i.e. \"caterwaul\") but is used to mean \"contrition after a failed endeavor\" or \"hangover\" in German (and, in the latter sense, in English too). Whereas Max & Moritz were grotesquely but comically put to death after seven destructive pranks, the Katzenjammer Kids and the other characters still thrive.\n\n\"The Katzenjammer Kids\" was so popular that it became two competing comic strips and the subject of a lawsuit. This happened because Dirks, in 1912, wanted to take a break after drawing the strip for 15 years, but the Hearst newspaper syndicate would not allow it. Dirks left anyway, and the strip was taken over by Harold Knerr. Dirks' last strip appeared March 16, 1913. Dirks sued, and after a long legal battle, the Hearst papers were allowed to continue \"The Katzenjammer Kids\", with Knerr as writer and artist. He took over permanently in the summer of 1914. However, Dirks was allowed to create an almost identical strip of his own for the rival Pulitzer newspapers, although he had to use a different name for the strip.\n\nInitially named \"Hans und Fritz\" after the two naughty protagonist brothers, Dirks' new feature was called \"The Captain and the Kids\" from 1918 on. \"The Captain and the Kids\" was very similar to \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" in terms of content and characters, but Dirks had a looser and more verbal style than Knerr, who on the other hand often produced stronger, more direct gags and drawings. \"The Captain and the Kids\" soon proved to equal the popularity of \"The Katzenjammer Kids\". It was later distributed by the United Feature Syndicate (while Hearst's King Features distributed \"The Katzenjammer Kids\").\n\n\"The Captain and the Kids\" also introduced some new characters. Ginga Dun is a snooty Indian trader who can outsmart almost anyone and only talks in verse. Captain Bloodshot is a pint-sized pirate rival of John Silver's.\n\n\"The Captain and the Kids\" expanded as a daily strip during the 1930s, but it had only a short run. However, the Sunday strip remained popular for decades. From 1946, Dirks' son, John Dirks, gradually began doing more of the work on \"The Captain and the Kids\". They introduced new characters and plots during the 1950s, including a 1958 science fiction storyline about a brilliant inventor and alien invasions. Even as John Dirks took over most of the work, Rudolph Dirks signed the strip until his death in 1968. John Dirks' drawing shifted slightly towards a more square-formed line, though it maintained the original style until \"The Captain and the Kids\" ended its run in 1979.\n\nKnerr continued drawing \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" until his death in 1949; the strip was then written and drawn by Charles H. \"Doc\" Winner (1949–56), with Joe Musial taking over in 1956. Musial was replaced on \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" by Mike Senich (1976–81), Angelo DeCesare (1981–86), and Hy Eisman (1986–2006). Now syndicated in reprint form, the strip is distributed internationally to some 50 newspapers and magazines. Eisman reused a lot of old gags and stories in later years.\n\n\"The Katzenjammer Kids\" (three brothers in the first strip but soon reduced to two) featured Hans and Fritz, twins who rebelled against authority, particularly in the form of their mother, Mama; der Captain, a shipwrecked sailor who acted as a surrogate father; and der Inspector, an official from the school system. Other characters included John Silver, a pirate sea captain and his crew, and King Bongo, a primitive-living but sophisticated-acting black jungle monarch who ruled a tropical island. Several of the characters spoke in stereotypical German-accented English. The main plot of the strip was Hans and Fritz would pull a prank or trick on one of the adults which resulted in their being hunted down and given a spanking in the end panel.\n\nKnerr's version of \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" introduced several major new characters in the 1930s. Miss Twiddle, a pompous tutor, and her brainy niece Lena came to stay permanently with the Katzenjammers in early 1936. Later in the year Twiddle's ex-pupil, \"boy prodigy\" Rollo Rhubarb joined them. The ever-smug Rollo is always trying to outwit Hans and Fritz, but his cunning plans often backfire.\n\nNotable features of the later strips included a more constructive relationship between the Captain and the boys, who sometimes had friendly conversations instead of fights. The King and his people were now Polynesian rather than African. \n\nThe \"Katzenjammer Kids\" characters initially appeared outside comics in a handful of live-action silent films, the first released in 1898. This first film, titled \"The Katzenjammer Kids In School\" was made for the Biograph Company by William George Bitzer. This film was followed in 1900 by another Bitzer-Biograph film, \"The Katzenjammer Kids in Love.\"\n\nBetween December 1916 and August 1918, a total of 37 \"Katzenjammer Kids\" silent cartoon shorts were produced by William Randolph Hearst's own cartoon studio International Film Service, which adapted well-known comic strips owned by Hearst for animation. The series was retired in 1918 at the height of the characters' popularity – partly because of the growing tension against titles with German associations after World War I. The comic strip was briefly renamed to \"The Shenanigan Kids\" around this time, and in 1920 another five cartoons were produced under this title. All \"Katzenjammer Kids\"/\"Shenanigan Kids\" cartoons from International Film Services were directed (and most likely also animated) by Gregory La Cava.\n\nIn addition, the Katzenjammer Kids had appearances (along with a lot of other King Features comic strip stars) in Filmation's TV special \"Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter\" (1972).\n\nIn 1938, \"The Captain and the Kids\" became the subject of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's first self-produced series of theatrical short subject cartoons, directed by William Hanna, Bob Allen and Friz Freleng: \"The Captain and the Kids\". Unlike the strip, which focused most of all on the gruesomely amusing antics of Hans and Fritz, the MGM cartoons often centered on the Captain. The series was overall unsuccessful, ending after one year and a total of 15 cartoons. Following that cancellation, Freleng returned to Warner Bros., where he had earlier been an animation director. The Captain was voiced by Billy Bletcher, and John Silver was voiced by Mel Blanc.\n\n\"The Captain and the Kids\" version of the strip was also animated for television as a back-up segment on Filmation's \"Archie's TV Funnies\" in 1971. \n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1983, she was appointed as a vice president, assistant treasurer and assistant secretary to several corporations to include Wilson Brothers, NVF company, Southeastern Public Service Authority and Birdsboro Corporation. In 1993, while still active in her father's many companies, Posner Ward was described as \"one of the world's wealthiest women\".\n\nIn 1994, Tracy Posner Ward and her husband, actor Burt Ward, founded Gentle Giants Rescue and Adoptions, a giant-breed dog rescue organization. The Wards operate a communal home for dogs, where they nurse 45–50 dogs at a time back to health, then put them up for adoption at their home and facility in Norco, California. The city of Norco limits nonprofit animal rescue organizations to 55 animals on premises at a time.\n\nIn August 1984, Posner Ward represented her father, Victor Posner, who was unable to attend the renaming of a street in his name by Hermitage, Pennsylvania. Speaking to the assembled guests and reporters, Posner Ward apologized for her father's inability to attend by saying, \"My father planned to come up to the last minute; I hope you realize how hard he tried to make it. He is truly honored by this decision.\" She declined to speak about her father's legal case in Florida.\n\nIn 1989, Victor Posner sent Tracy to take over Burt Ward's publicly traded fund-raising company.\n\nIn 1994, Posner Ward sued her half brother Steven Posner, claiming he let one of her smaller trust funds, worth $2 million, dwindle to $100,000 with undocumented loans and other transactions of little or no value.

Posner Ward was involved in lawsuits until April 2015 which entangled the estate of her late father, industrialist Victor Posner, who changed his will shortly before he died in 2002, and removed his children and grandchildren as heirs to his estate. A lawsuit by Troy Posner, not including Tracy, was eventually settled for $14 million.\n\nPosner appeared in three films with her husband, Burt Ward.

{"id": "48029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48029", "title": "Valerie Solanas", "text": "Valerie Solanas\n\nValerie Jean Solanas (April 9, 1936 – April 25, 1988) was an American radical feminist and author best known for writing the \"SCUM Manifesto,\" which she self-published in 1967, and attempting to murder Andy Warhol in 1968.\n\nSolanas had a turbulent childhood. She said her father regularly sexually abused her and she had a volatile relationship with her mother and stepfather after her parents' divorce. She was sent to live with her grandparents but ran away after being physically abused by her alcoholic grandfather. Solanas came out as a lesbian in the 1950s. After graduating with a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland, College Park, Solanas relocated to Berkeley, California, where she began writing her most notable work, the \"SCUM Manifesto\", which urged women to \"overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex\".\n\nSolanas moved to New York City in the mid-1960s. She met pop artist Andy Warhol and asked him to produce her play \"Up Your Ass\". She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing or stealing. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, \"I, a Man\", paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the \"SCUM Manifesto\". Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in early 1968.\n\nOn June 3, 1968, she went to The Factory, where she found Warhol. She shot at Warhol three times, the first two shots missing and the third wounding Warhol. She also shot art critic Mario Amaya and attempted to shoot Warhol's manager, Fred Hughes, point blank, but the gun jammed. Solanas then turned herself in to the police. She was charged with attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a gun. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and pleaded guilty to \"reckless assault with intent to harm\", serving a three-year prison sentence, including treatment in a psychiatric hospital. After her release, she continued to promote the \"SCUM Manifesto\". She died in 1988 of pneumonia in San Francisco.\n\nSolanas was born in 1936 in Ventnor City, New Jersey, to Louis Solanas and Dorothy Marie Biondo. Her father was a bartender and her mother a dental assistant. She had a younger sister, Judith Arlene Solanas Martinez. Her father was born in Montreal to parents who immigrated from Spain and her mother was an Italian-American of Genoan and Sicilian descent born in Philadelphia.\n\nSolanas said that her father regularly sexually abused her. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, in 1949 her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again.\n\nDespite this, she graduated from high school on time and earned a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she was in the Psi Chi Honor Society. While at the University of Maryland, she hosted a call-in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men. She was also an open lesbian, despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s.\n\nShe attended the University of Minnesota's Graduate School of Psychology, where she worked in the animal research laboratory, before dropping out and moving to attend Berkeley for a few courses. It was during this time that she began writing the \"SCUM Manifesto\".\n\nIn the mid-1960s Solanas moved to New York City, where she supported herself through begging and prostitution. In 1965 she wrote two works: an autobiographical short story, \"A Young Girl's Primer on How to Attain the Leisure Class\", and a play, \"Up Your Ass\", about a young prostitute. According to James Martin Harding, the play is \"based on a plot about a woman who 'is a man-hating hustler and panhandler' and who ... ends up killing a man.\" Harding describes it as more a \"provocation than ... a work of dramatic literature\" and \"rather adolescent and contrived.\" The short story was published in \"Cavalier\" magazine in July 1966. \"Up Your Ass\" remained unpublished until 2014.\n\nIn 1967, Solanas encountered Andy Warhol outside his studio, The Factory, and asked him to produce her play. He accepted the script for review, told Solanas it was \"well typed\", and promised to read it. According to Factory lore, Warhol, whose films were often shut down by the police for obscenity, thought the script was so pornographic that it must have been a police trap. Solanas contacted Warhol about the script, and was told that he had lost it. He also jokingly offered her a job at the Factory as a typist. Insulted, Solanas demanded money for the lost manuscript. Instead, Warhol paid her $25 to appear in his film \"I, a Man\".\n\nIn her role in \"I, a Man\", she leaves the film's title character (played by Tom Baker) to fend for himself, explaining \"I gotta go beat my meat\" as she exits the scene. Solanas was satisfied with her experience working with Warhol and her performance in the film, and brought Maurice Girodias to see the film. Girodias described her as being \"very relaxed and friendly with Warhol.\" Solanas also had a nonspeaking role in Warhol's film \"Bikeboy\", in 1967.\n\nIn 1967, Solanas self-published her best-known work, the \"SCUM Manifesto\", a scathing critique of patriarchal culture. The manifesto's opening words are:\n\nSome authors have argued that the \"Manifesto\" is a parody of patriarchy and a satirical work and, according to Harding, Solanas described herself as \"a social propagandist\", but Solanas denied that the work was \"a put on\" and insisted that her intent was \"dead serious\". The \"Manifesto\" has been translated into over a dozen languages and is excerpted in several feminist anthologies.\n\nWhile living at the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas introduced herself to Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press and a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her \"next writing, and other writings\". In exchange, Girodias paid her $500. She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that \"everything I write will be his. He's done this to me ... He's screwed me!\" Solanas intended to write a novel based on the \"SCUM Manifesto\", and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the \"Up Your Ass\" script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.\n\nOn May 31, 1968, Solanas went to writer Paul Krassner to ask him for $50, which he loaned to her. Krassner later speculated that Solanas could have used the money to buy the gun she used to shoot Warhol, as the shooting was only three days later.\n\nAccording to an unquoted source in \"The Outlaw Bible of American Literature\", on June 3, 1968, at 9:00 am, Solanas arrived at the Chelsea Hotel, where Girodias lived. She asked for him at the desk but was told he was gone for the weekend. She remained for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available.\n\nIn her 2014 biography \"Valerie Solanas\", Breanne Fahs argues that it is unlikely that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the \"SCUM Manifesto\", which he had published. Fahs states that \"the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning.\" Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas \"had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind.\" Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then \"shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble.\"\n\nFahs records that Solanas then traveled to producer Margo Feiden's (then Margo Eden) residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Solanas believed that Feiden would be willing to produce her play. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas's play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out her gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, Solanas responded, \"Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it.\" As she was leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a copy of her play (a partial copy of an earlier draft of \"Up Your Ass\") and other personal papers.\n\nFahs describes how Feiden then \"frantically called her local police precinct, Andy Warhol's precinct, police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and the offices of Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on her way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol.\" In some instances, the police responded that \"You can't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol,\" and even asked Feiden \"Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like?\" In a 2009 interview with James Barron of \"The New York Times\", Feiden said that she knew Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it. (A \"New York Times\" assistant Metro editor responded to an online comment regarding the story, saying that the \"Times\" \"does not present the account as definitive.\")\n\nFahs additionally cites Assistant District Attorney Roderick Lankler's handwritten notes on the case, written on June 4, 1968, which begin with Margo Feiden's stage name, \"Margo Eden\", address, and telephone numbers at the top of the page.\n\nLater that day, Solanas arrived at the Factory and waited outside. Morrissey arrived and asked her what she was doing there, and she replied \"I'm waiting for Andy to get money\". Morrissey tried to get rid of her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day, but she told him she would wait. At 2:00 pm she went up into the studio. Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not coming in and that she had to leave. She left but rode the elevator up and down until Warhol finally boarded it.\n\nShe entered The Factory with Warhol, who complimented her on her appearance as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup. Morrissey told her to leave, threatening to \"beat the hell\" out of her and throw her out otherwise. The phone rang and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom. While Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through both lungs, his spleen, stomach, liver, and esophagus. She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip. She tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol's manager, in the head, but her gun jammed. Hughes asked her to leave, which she did, leaving behind a paper bag with her address book on a table. Warhol was taken to Columbus–Mother Cabrini Hospital, where he underwent a successful five-hour operation.\n\nLater that day, Solanas turned herself in, gave up her gun, and confessed to the shooting, telling a police officer that Warhol \"had too much control in my life.\" She was fingerprinted and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the \"New York Daily News\" ran the front-page headline \"Actress Shoots Andy Warhol.\" Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement that she was an actress. The \"Daily News\" changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating \"I'm a writer, not an actress.\" At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn't produce her play but said \"it was for the opposite reason\", that \"he has a legal claim on my works.\" Solanas told the judge that \"it's not often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me.\" She told the judge she wanted to represent herself and she declared that she \"was right in what I did! I have nothing to regret!\" \"The judge struck her comments from the court record\" and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation.\n\nAfter a cursory evaluation, Solanas was declared mentally unstable and transferred to the prison ward of Elmhurst Hospital. Solanas appeared at New York Supreme Court on June 13, 1968. Florynce Kennedy represented her and asked for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that Solanas was being held inappropriately at Elmhurst. The judge denied the motion and Solanas returned to Elmhurst. On June 28, Solanas was indicted on charges of attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a gun. She was declared \"incompetent\" in August and sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. That same month, Olympia Press published the \"SCUM Manifesto\" with essays by Girodias and Krassner.\n\nIn January 1969, Solanas underwent psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. In June, she was finally deemed fit to stand trial. She represented herself without an attorney and pleaded guilty to \"reckless assault with intent to harm\". She was sentenced to three years in prison, with one year of time served.\n\nThe shooting of Warhol propelled Solanas into the public spotlight, prompting a flurry of commentary and opinions in the media. Robert Marmorstein, writing in \"The Village Voice\", declared that Solanas \"has dedicated the remainder of her life to the avowed purpose of eliminating every single male from the face of the earth.\" Norman Mailer called her the \"Robespierre of feminism.\"\n\nTi-Grace Atkinson, the New York chapter president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), described Solanas as \"the first outstanding champion of women's rights\" and \"a 'heroine' of the feminist movement\", and \"smuggled [her manifesto] ... out of the mental hospital where Solanas was confined.\" According to Betty Friedan, the NOW board rejected Atkinson. Atkinson left NOW and started another feminist organization, According to Friedan, \"the media continued to treat Ti-Grace as a leader of the women's movement, despite its repudiation of her.\"\n\nAnother NOW member, Florynce Kennedy, called Solanas \"one of the most important spokeswomen of the feminist movement.\"\n\nEnglish professor Dana Heller argued that Solanas was \"very much aware of feminist organizations and activism\", but \"had no interest in participating in what she often described as 'a civil disobedience luncheon club.'\" Heller also stated that Solanas could \"reject mainstream liberal feminism for its blind adherence to cultural codes of feminine politeness and decorum which the \"SCUM Manifesto\" identifies as the source of women's debased social status.\"\n\nAfter Solanas was released from the New York State Prison for Women in 1971, she stalked Warhol and others over the telephone and was arrested again in November 1971. She was subsequently institutionalized several times and then drifted into obscurity.\n\nThe attack had a profound impact on Warhol and his art, and security at the Factory scene became much stronger afterward. For the rest of his life, Warhol lived in fear that Solanas would attack him again. \"It was the Cardboard Andy, not the Andy I could love and play with,\" said close friend and collaborator Billy Name. \"He was so sensitized you couldn't put your hand on him without him jumping. I couldn't even love him anymore, because it hurt him to touch him.\"\n\nSolanas may have intended to write an eponymous autobiography. In a 1977 \"Village Voice\" interview, she announced a book with her name as the title. The book, possibly intended as a parody, was supposed to deal with the \"conspiracy\" that led to her imprisonment. In a corrective 1977 \"Village Voice\" interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion and that it would be about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would \"deal \"very\" intensively with the subject of bullshit\", but she said nothing about parody.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, in New York City, according to Heller, Solanas was \"apparently homeless\", \"continued to defend her political beliefs and the \"SCUM Manifesto\"\", and \"actively promoted\" her new \"Manifesto\" revision.\n\nUltra Violet, according to her somewhat unreliable report, interviewed her. Solanas was then known as Onz Loh. Solanas stated that the August 1968 version of the manifesto had many errors, unlike her own printed version of October 1967, and that the book had not sold well. She also said that, until told by Violet, she was unaware of Warhol's death.\n\nOn April 25, 1988, at the age of 52, Solanas died of pneumonia at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: \"Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing at her desk. There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery.\" Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously.\n\nSolanas's life has been the focus of numerous performances, films, musical compositions, and publications.\n\nIn 1996, actress Lili Taylor played Solanas in the film \"I Shot Andy Warhol\", which focused on Solanas's assassination attempt on Warhol (played by Jared Harris). Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the Sundance Film Festival for her role. The film's director, Mary Harron, requested permission to use songs by The Velvet Underground, but was denied by Lou Reed, who feared that Solanas would be glorified in the film. Six years before the film's release, Reed and John Cale included a song about Solanas, \"I Believe\", on their concept album about Warhol, \"Songs for Drella\" (1990). In \"I Believe\", Reed sings, \"I believe life's serious enough for retribution... I believe being sick is no excuse. And I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself.\" Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol's death from a gallbladder infection 20 years after she shot him.\n\nSolanas's life has inspired three plays. \"Valerie Shoots Andy\" (2001), by Carson Kreitzer, starred two actors playing a younger (Heather Grayson) and an older (Lynne McCollough) Solanas. \"Tragedy in Nine Lives\" (2003), by Karen Houppert, examined the encounter between Solanas and Warhol as a Greek tragedy and starred Juliana Francis as Solanas. Most recently, in 2011, \"Pop!\", a musical by Maggie-Kate Coleman and Anna K. Jacobs, focused mainly on Warhol (played by Tom Story). Rachel Zampelli played Solanas and sang \"Big Gun\", described as the \"evening's strongest number\" by \"The Washington Post\".\n\n\"Up Your Ass\" was rediscovered in 1999 and produced in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco. The copy Warhol had lost was found in a trunk of lighting equipment owned by Billy Name. Coates learned about the rediscovered manuscript while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum marking the 30th anniversary of the shooting. Coates turned the piece into a musical with an all-female cast. Coates consulted with Solanas's sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a \"very funny satirist\" out of Solanas, not just showing her as Warhol's attempted assassin.\n\nSwedish author Sara Stridsberg wrote a semi-fictional novel about Solanas called \"Drömfakulteten\" (English: \"The Dream Faculty\"). The book's narrator visits Solanas toward the end of her life at the Bristol Hotel. Stridsberg was awarded the Nordic Council's Literature Prize for the book.\n\nComposer Pauline Oliveros released \"To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of Their Desperation\" in 1970. In the work Oliveros seeks to explore how \"Both women seemed to be desperate and caught in the traps of inequality: Monroe needed to be recognized for her talent as an actress. Solanas wished to be supported for her own creative work.\"\n\nThere is a music group from Belgium called The Valerie Solanas.\n\nSolanas was featured in a 2017 episode of the FX series \"\", \"\". She was played by Lena Dunham. The episode portrayed Solanas as the instigator of most of the Zodiac Killer murders.\n\nSolanas's role as a cult figure was solidified with the publication of the \"SCUM Manifesto\" and her shooting of Warhol. Harding explained that, by declaring herself independent from Warhol, after her arrest she \"aligned herself with the historical avant-garde's rejection of the traditional structures of bourgeois theater\", and that her anti-patriarchal \"militant hostility ... pushed the avant-garde in radically new directions.\" Harding believed that Solanas' assassination attempt on Warhol was its own theatrical performance. At the shooting, she left on a table at the Factory a paper bag containing a gun, her address book, and a sanitary napkin. Harding stated that leaving behind the sanitary napkin was part of the performance, and called \"attention to basic feminine experiences that were publically taboo and tacitly elided within avant-garde circles.\"\n\nFeminist philosopher Avital Ronell compared Solanas to an array of people: Lorena Bobbitt; a \"girl Nietzsche\"; Medusa; the Unabomber; and Medea. Ronell believed that Solanas was threatened by the hyper-feminine women of the Factory that Warhol liked and felt lonely because of the rejection she felt due to her own butch androgyny. She believed Solanas was ahead of her time, living in a period before feminist and lesbian revolutionaries such as the Guerrilla Girls and the Lesbian Avengers.\n\nSolanas has also been credited with instigating radical feminism. Catherine Lord wrote that \"the feminist movement would not have happened without Valerie Solanas.\" Lord believed that the reissuing of the \"SCUM Manifesto\" and the disowning of Solanas by \"women's liberation politicos\" triggered a wave of radical feminist publications. According to Vivian Gornick, many of the women's liberation activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later, developing the first wave of radical feminism. At the same time, perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political, according to Harding and Victor Bockris.\n\nBreanne Fahs describes Solanas as a contradiction that \"alienates her from the feminist movement.\" Fahs argues that Solanas never wanted to be \"in movement\" but nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking NOW members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in her lifestyle as a lesbian who sexually serviced men, her claim to be asexual, a rejection of queer culture, and a non-interest in working with others despite a dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas's life. She is described as a victim, a rebel, and a desperate loner, yet Solanas' cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear said she had a \"groovy childhood.\" Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life, despite claiming that he sexually abused her. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a Manchester solicitor by profession in the firm of Hockin, Beckton & Hockin.\n\nBeckton began to collect stamps as a boy in 1879. Greece and Italy were two of his particular interests and in competitive philately he won medals for his Greece, Straits Settlements, Japan, British West Indies, and Romania. He won the Lindenberg Medal in 1931.\n\nBeckton was one of the Manchester school of philately which advocated the scientific study of all aspects of stamp production including paper, watermark, printing and perforation. He was president of the Manchester Philatelic Society for thirty-five years consecutively. He joined The Royal Philatelic Society London in February 1892, eventually becoming president of that society from 1929 until his death in 1931. He was also vice-president of the International Philatelic Union. He wrote extensively on philately and was a regular contributor to the \"Philatelic Journal of Great Britain\" and other philatelic periodicals.\n\nBeckton's death was unexpected, reportedly from \"angina pectoris\", over the night of 17–18 March 1931 while he was still president of the Royal. He did not marry and was survived by a sister and brother. His collection of philatelic literature of over 900 volumes was donated to the Manchester public library in 1934 where it is still available as the \"Beckton Philatelic Library\". His collection of Greece was auctioned by H.R. Harmer in two sales of 1935 and 1936.\n\nSelected papers and articles reprinted from \"The London Philatelist\":\n\n\n\n"}

On his father's side of the family, he descends from a rabbinical Sephardi line with roots in Bessarabia which was, at the turn of the 20th century, a province of Russia. On his mother's side, he is descended from a Polish Ashkenazi family. His Ashkenazi great-grandfather was Zerah Barnet, who helped found the Orthodox Meah Shearim district, just outside the Old City of Jerusalem, and a Hebrew yeshiva in Jaffa.\n\nHe attended Saint Martin's School of Art and the Royal Academy, studying painting during his time there. After college his jobs included working in general and psychiatric hospitals, as well as in a theatre workshop and at the Royal Opera House.\nBesides theatre work and practising graphic design , he also taught at RADA and the Architectural Association. He ran workshops for the Wrekin Trust and has lectured at the Theosophical Society, the Royal College of Art and the Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture.\n\nHe first started studying Kabbalah at the age of 25. Since then, he has been a student and tutor of the Kabbalah for more than 60 years, beginning to teach it in 1971. During this time he has visited nearly all the old major centres of Kabbalah in Europe, North Africa and Israel, while specialising in the Toledano Tradition, a form that derives from the Sephardi Kabbalah which developed in early medieval Spain and France and which included among its focal points the towns of Lunel and Girona and the city of Toledo. \n\nThese and other centres flowered, producing among their practitioners of mysticism and Kabbalah Solomon ibn Gabirol, Isaac the Blind and Nachmanides. During this period Kabbalists incorporated into their expositions and exegeses a degree of Neoplatonic emanationism, called Ein Sof by kabbalists, that conformed to the requirements of Jewish theology and philosophy, though, to some extent, in medieval times, it conflicted with the Aristotelian approach to Jewish philosophy by Maimonides and his followers.\n\nA fellow of the Temenos Academy, UK, instituted by the poet, Kathleen Raine, Halevi regularly lectures there. He has taught groups on every continent, including at Interface Boston, the New York Open Centre; The Centre for Psychological Astrology, UK; Omega Institute; New York Kabbalah Society; the Jungian Institute of Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Karen Kabbalah, Atlanta, as well as in synagogues and at rabbinical colleges. He is the Director of Tutors for the Kabbalah Society and for many years ran a series of Kabbalah courses at Regent's College in London.\n\nHe travels widely and runs a continuing series of \"Way of Kabbalah\" courses and lectures held in many countries, including America, Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Germany, Holland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Scotland and Spain, though few of his lectures have been published and fewer still are online; similarly with his articles. . Over the years, he has also taken part in a series of interviews for various media.\n\nHalevi is as well known a writer as he is a teacher, having published 18 books, including a kabbalistic novel and books on astrology and kabbalistic astrology. Contemporary astrologers such as Judy Hall refer to the work he has done on the latter. , p. 22. In the earlier part of his career he wrote a number of books on stagecraft. Both he and his work on the Toledano Tradition are publicly recognised. and his work has now been translated into over thirteen languages, including Hebrew.\n\nMany of his publications are issued under his Hebrew name, Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi, a contraction of his full family name of Z'ev ben Shimon ben Joshua Haham-Halevi. Both of his families were Levites, according to family records. When his grandfather migrated to England in 1900 the name Haham was recorded as Kaufman; it was later changed to Kenton.\n\n\nIn an introduction to the Sacred Web Conference, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, 23/24 September 2006 at the University of Alberta in 2006, the Prince of Wales, a Patron of the Temenos Academy, said, when talking of the tension between Tradition and Modernism:\n\nThis dilemma is captured in ancient notions of balance and harmony; notions that are, for example, expressed in many guises in that wonderful Kabbalistic diagram of the Tree of Life. As the Temenos Fellow, Warren Kenton, so beautifully explains in his lectures to the students of the Academy, the teaching of the Tree of Life is that the \"active\" and the \"passive\" aspects of life, which on their own may lead to imbalance and disharmony, must be, can only be, brought together in harmony by the influx into our lives of the Divine and the Sacred. Whether or not we interpret this image as an explanation of an outer or an inner orientation, it is in this way, and only in this way, that the forces, or characteristics, of expansion and constraint can be brought into balance.\n\nThere is a DVD that includes this portion of the Prince's talk on the World Wisdom website. \n\n\nThe poet, Kathleen Raine, had this to say about Halevi's work:\n\nA feature of this author's system not found in others (although doubtless it is traditional though not universally taught) is the beautiful way in which the interfaces of each 'world' overlap with the one above (or below). Thus, the highest experiences of the physical world overlap the lower part of the next world (the psychological]: and again psyche's highest experiences of the individual soul coincide with spiritual regions of the transpersonal world of universal forms. So from illumination to illumination we reascend the 'ladder' by which each of us 'came down to earth from heaven'. The awe-inspiring sublimity of the Kabbalistic universe at once convinces and comforts. It is our destiny to descend and to fulfil some task, learn some lesson in the natural world; as it is to follow the path of return, to reascend from world to world, no matter how many lifetimes this may take us before we return to our true home, 'the kingdom of Heaven'. \"Kathleen Raine, Light Magazine, Spring 1989.\"\n\n\nSinger Sinéad O'Connor wrote in the inner sleeve notes to the album, \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\", \"Special thanks to Selina Marshall + Warren Kenton for showing me that all I'd need was inside me.\"\n\n\nArtist Charles Thomson said, \"I studied Kabbalah under a teacher called Warren Kenton, who said there was a lot of humour at the spiritual level, and I think that's true.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA professor of Kabbalah at Hebrew University of Jerusalem has bemoaned the hijacking of kabba'lah by various New Age authors and has given Halevi as an example. Joseph Dan, in his work \"The Heart and the Fountain: An Anthology of Jewish Mystical Experiences\", writes in footnote 57 to the introduction:\n\nIn 'Authorized Guardians' in \"Polemical Encounters\" (Olav Hammer and Kocku von Stuckrad (ed.), Leiden:Brill, 2007; p. 89) Prof. Boaz Huss at Ben-Gurion university points at the fact that the criticism launched at Halevi does appear in the chapter 'The Christian kabbalah'. These and other attempts can be viewed as 'boundary-constructing discourse' and 'othering of the enemy', depicting him as 'debased' or 'degenerated' to annihilate him (cp. Huss in Hammer/Von Stuckrad, 2007, xiii). Halevi lives in the London borough of Brent.\n\n"}
