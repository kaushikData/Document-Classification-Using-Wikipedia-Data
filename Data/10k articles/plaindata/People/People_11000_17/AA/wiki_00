Born in Barcelona, Spain she held Guatemalan citizenship and lived in exile in Mexico. She worked as a professor in both Guatemala and Mexico. Much of her poetry was published in Mexico and she co-founded one of the first feminist publications, \"Fem\", in the country. After her husband's death, she made a trip to Guatemala to see her mother and renew her passport. She was detained and disappeared in Guatemala City on 19 December 1980, presumed to be murdered. Some sources note the date of her disappearance as 9 December 1980.\n\nMaría Alaíde Foppa Falla was born 3 December 1914 in Barcelona, Spain to Tito Livio Foppa and Julia Falla. Her mother was a pianist of Guatemalan descent and her father was an Argentine- Italian diplomat. She grew up traveling, living in Belgium, France and Italy. She was educated in Italy, studying the history of art and literature. She spoke fluent Italian and worked for several years as a translator.\n\nIn the 1940s, Foppa attained Guatemalan citizenship, and married a Guatemalan leftist, Alfonso Solórzano. A member of the FDN, he was an \"intellectual communist\", who managed the Guatemala Institute of Social Security. Solórzano eventually also served as a cabinet adviser to Guatemalan president Jacobo Árbenz With Solórzano, she had four children, born in Mexico: Mario, Juan Pablo, Silvia and Laura. Foppa's oldest son Julio was the child of Juan José Arévalo, Árbenz's predecessor as president of Guatemala. \n\nFoppa served on the faculty of the humanities department at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (University of San Carlos of Guatemala) and was a founder of the Italian Institute of Culture in the Central American country. She and her husband were forced to flee the country in 1954 when the presidency of Jacobo Árbenz was overthrown by a CIA-backed military coup.\n\nFoppa lived in exile in Mexico, working as a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where she taught Italian at the School of Philosophy and Letters and offered the first-ever course at a Latin American university on the sociology of women. She lectured at other institutions, published columns and served as an art critic in local newspapers, and she wrote much of her poetry in Mexico City. It is believed that other than a volume called \"Poesías\" printed in Madrid and \"La Sin Ventura\" published in Guatemala, all her other poetic works were published in Mexico, though she wrote and edited some of them at her family's farm in the Sacatepéquez Department, while visiting her mother.\n\nIn 1972, she created the radio program \"Foro de la Mujer\" (Women's Forum) which was broadcast on \"Radio Universidad\", to discuss inequalities within Mexican society, violence and how violence should be treated as a public rather than a private concern, and to explore women's lives. In 1975, she co-founded with Margarita García Flores the publication \"Fem\", a magazine for scholarly analysis of issues from a feminist perspective. Foppa financed the publication from her own funds. Important Mexican journalists and intellectuals aided in the co-founding of the magazine. Many prominent Latin Americans in the early 1980s did not identify with \"Feminism\" but rather with \"Humanism\", as in the case of Griselda Alvarez when asked by \"Fem\".\n\nFoppa was also a regular participant in events with Amnesty International and the International Association of Women Against Repression (AIMUR). With others of the Guatemalan intellectual community, Foppa denounced the government for human rights violations and her name began appearing on published lists of \"subversives\".\n\nWhen her husband Solórzano was struck and killed by a car, Foppa went to Guatemala, ostensibly to visit her mother and renew her passport, but it was believed she had decided to work for the guerrillas. By one account, she had engaged in a guerrilla courier mission to Guatemala City, where she was promptly captured by government security forces. Both of her sons Mario and Juan Pablo, though born in Mexico, had returned to fight with the guerrilla forces in Guatemala and were killed. Her daughter, Silvia, who also supported the rebels, had been in hiding in Cuba for a while and at the time of Foppa's disappearance was back in Guatemala.\n\nFoppa's daughter Laura was a dancer and was performing in a production at the Covarrubias Theatre that was to open on 21 December 1980. When she called to verify that her mother would be returning for the performance, she learned from her grandmother of her mother's disappearance with the chauffeur, Leocadio Axtún Chiroy. Oldest son, Julio Solórzano Foppa, got a phone call from Laura who imparted the news to him and oldest daughter, Silvia learned of her mother's disappearance on the radio in a guerrilla camp in the mountains of El Quiché.\n\nFoppa had apparently gone to buy flowers and pick up her passport in Guatemala City on 19 December 1980. She was accompanied by her mother's driver, Leocadio Axtún, who had taken her to the Plaza El Amate, where they were intercepted, and never heard from again. Rumors were that she was tortured by a death squad of a high-ranking minister and killed the same day she was captured. Initially the newspapers carried a report that she had been abducted by members of the G-2 intelligence unit, beaten, and forced into a car, which sped away, but fearful of retaliation witnesses would not come forward.\n\nWhen news of the disappearance reached friends and family, they mobilized. Daughter Laura, who had won a grant to study dance in New York, used the trip to visit both the United Nations and the office of human rights of the Organization of American States. Julio, flew to Paris and with the help of friends secured an audience with the Legislative Assembly in an attempt to put international pressure on the Guatemalan government. Friends wrote letters and formed committees to demand action from the Guatemalan authorities.\n\nJulio returned to Mexico and met with Jorge Castañeda y Álvarez de la Rosa, Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Mexican president Jose Lopez Portillo authorized a commission of legal scholars, journalists and Foppa's children to go to investigate the disappearance; however, right before the group was to leave, a veiled threat was received telling them they were welcome to come but that \"international communism, in its efforts to make the Guatemalan government look bad, may cause harm… to come to them.\" The group decided the risk was too great, since Foppa was probably not still alive.\n\nOn 2 December 1999, Foppa's children requested that the Audiencia Nacional de España open an inquiry. Though a case was opened, Guatemalan authorities did not respond. In 2005, an explosion at an obscure police station on the outskirts of Guatemala City revealed an archive of records going back to the creation in 1880 of the National Police. Forensic teams began examining the documents in the Guatemala National Police Archives, and Julio Solórzano wanted to ensure that the documents remained accessible. He contacted Karen Engle at the University of Texas’ Rapoport Center for Human Rights and persuaded them to digitize the records. He is hopeful that within the archive is information on his mother's case.\n\nIn 2010, Foppa's family, \"Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo\" (GAM) (Mutual Support Group) and the \"Centro de Reportes Informativos sobre Guatemala\" (CERIGUA) (Center of Informative Reports on Guatemala) and other organizations demanded that an inquiry into Foppa's disappearance be launched by Guatemalan authorities. In 2012, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) filed a complaint against Guatemala's inaction on the case. In 2014, Foppa's daughter Silvia concurred that there was no resolution from any of the court actions—in Spain, before the Guatemalan Supreme Court, or from the IACHR case. The whereabouts of Foppa and what happened to her is still unanswered. In 2014, a documentary by Maricarmen de Lara entitled “¡Alaíde Foppa, la sin ventura!” (Alaide Foppa, without luck) was released.\n\n"}
{"id": "923383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923383", "title": "Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy", "text": "Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy\n\nCount Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, often referred to as A. K. Tolstoy () ( – ), was a Russian poet, novelist and playwright, considered to be the most important nineteenth-century Russian historical dramatist, primarily on the strength of his dramatic trilogy \"The Death of Ivan the Terrible\" (1866), \"Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich\" (1868), and \"Tsar Boris\" (1870). He also gained fame for his satirical works, published under his own name (\"History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev\", \"The Dream of Councillor Popov\") and under the collaborational pen name of Kozma Prutkov. His fictional works include the novella \"The Family of the Vourdalak\", \"The Vampire\" (1841), and the historical novel \"Prince Serebrenni\" (1862).\n\nAleksey was a member of the Tolstoy family, and a second cousin of Leo Tolstoy. Due to his mother's closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future Alexander II's childhood entourage and became \"a comrade in games\" for the young Crown Prince. As a young man Tolstoy traveled widely, including trips to Italy and Germany, where he met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Tolstoy began his education at home under the tutelage of his uncle the writer Antony Pogorelsky, under whose influence he first became interested in writing poetry, and a number of other teachers. In 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a student. In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the University of Moscow.\n\nThroughout the 1840s Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees and fleeting romances. He also spent many years in state service as a bureaucrat and diplomat. In 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy one of his personal aide-de-adjutants. Tolstoy served as an infantry major in the Crimean War. He eventually left state service in the early 1860s to pursue his literary career. He died in 1875 of a self-administered lethal dose of morphine at his Krasny Rog estate in the Chernigov Governorate.\n\nAlexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy was born in Saint Petersburg to the famed family of Tolstoy. His father, Count Konstantin Petrovich Tolstoy (1780–1870), a son of the army general, was a Russian state assignation bank councilor. His mother, Anna Alekseyevna Perovskaya (1796–1857), was an illegitimate daughter of Count Aleksey Kirillovich Razumovsky (1784–1822), an heir of the legendary Ukrainian hetman Alexey Razumovsky. A. K. Tolstoy's uncle (on his father's side) was Fyodor Tolstoy (1783–1873). His uncle on his mother's side was Aleksey Perovsky (1787–1836), an author known under the pen name of Antony Pogorelsky. Aleksey Konstantinovich was a second cousin of Leo Tolstoy; Count Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy was their common great-grandfather.\n\nKonstantin Tolstoy and Anna Perovskaya's marriage was short-lived; they divorced in October 1817. With her six weeks old son, Anna moved first to her own Blistava estate in Chernigov Governorate, then to Krasny Rog, an estate belonging to her brother Aleksey Perovsky, who became Aleksey Konstantinovich's tutor and a long-time companion. Common knowledge has it that Pogorelsky's famous fantasy fairytale \"The Black Chicken or The People of the Underground\" was premiered at home, his young nephew being the only member of Pogorelsky's audience. It was under the latter's influence that Aleksey started to write poetry, as early as 1823, inspired by some old books he found at home. Aleksey had good teachers and at the age of six he fluently spoke French, German and English. Later he learned Italian as well.\n\nAs for the Tolstoys, Anna Perovskaya stopped seeing them altogether, only sending them postcards on major dates and holidays. Remembering those happy years, Aleksey later wrote: \nIn early 1826 Anna Perovskaya returned to Saint Petersburg with her brother and son. Here, due to his mother's closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future Tsar Alexander II's childhood entourage and in August became what was officially termed \"a comrade in games\" for the young Crown Prince. Aleksey's duties were not many: he had to visit the Crown Prince in Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo, take walks with him on Yelagin Island and participate in games, many of which were, in effect, small scale military exercises. They became friends and this friendship lasted for several decades, ending in the mid-1860s. In autumn of 1826 Aleksey met Aleksander Pushkin for the first time.\n\nIn summer 1827 the family visited Germany where in Weimar young Aleksey met Goethe. The great man greeted the boy very warmly and left him a fragment of a mammoth tusk with his own drawing (depicting a frigate) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: \"Only his magnificent features and the way he took me upon his lap,\" according to his autobiography. The family spent the next ten years in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. \"Back in Russia I fell into a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams carried me off to this Paradise lost,\" he wrote in his autobiography decades later. In Italy the family met Karl Bryullov. On May 10, 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: \"Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album.\" The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.\n\nIn 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a \"student\", where he got his first taste of working with real historical documents. In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the University of Moscow for the formal 1st Grade State Bureaucrat certificate. He soon embarked on a career in the Economic Affairs and Statistics Department in Saint Petersburg. Before that, in July 1835, he had buried his uncle Aleksey Perovsky (who died in Warsaw of tuberculosis) and had become heir to his Krasny Rog estate. Also in 1835 Aleksey showed some of his new poems to Vasily Zhukovsky, who praised them. There's evidence that Pushkin also approved of the young poet's early works, giving him full moral support. Tolstoy wrote a lot, refining his technique, but wasn't eager to get published. \"My first experiments were, no doubt, absurd, but at least metrically they were flawless. I went on training thus for many years, before I debuted... as a prose writer, not a poet,\" he remembered later. \n\nIn January 1837 Tolstoy became attached to the Russian Embassy in Frankfurt where he spent the next two years. The assignment was rather formal; it did not demand Tolstoy's presence in Germany and he spent most of his time in Saint Petersburg, leading a merry life, spending up to three thousand rubles per month, often traveling to Italy and France. It was during one of these visits that he wrote his first two \"gothic\" novellas – \"The Family of the Vourdalak\" and \"Three Hundred Years On\" (originally in German, later translated into Russian by Boleslav Markevich). Tolstoy showed great interest in all things macabre, influenced, again, by his late uncle who \"was obsessed with mysticism in every possible form\" and who, in turn, was influenced by E. T. A. Hoffmann whom he was personally acquainted with.\n\nIn late 1840 Tolstoy was transferred back to Russia to a position in the Tsar's Imperial State Chancellery 2nd Department where he continued to work for many years, slowly rising in the hierarchy. As time went by, though, he showed less and less enthusiasm, for the demands of his position had come to feel like a major hindrance to his literary aspirations. In May 1841 Tolstoy debuted with \"The Vampire\" (a novella published under the pen name of \"Krasnorogsky\", a reference to Krasny Rog, his residence). Complicated in structure, multi-layered and rich in counterpoints, featuring both the element of \"horror\" and political satire, it instantly caught the attention of Vissarion Belinsky who praised its \"obviously still very young, but undoubtedly gifted author,\" totally unaware of the latter's real identity. Tolstoy himself saw the story as insignificant and made no attempt to include it in any of the subsequent compilations; it was only in 1900 that \"The Vampire\" was re-issued. In the autumn of 1843 Tolstoy debuted as a poet: his poem \"Serebryanka\" was published in the No.40 edition of \"Listok Dlya Svetskikh Lyudey\" (The Paper for Fashionable People).\n\nIt took another two years for him to see his second short story, \"Artyomy Semyonovich Bervenkovsky\", a homage to the so-called 'natural school' apparently written under the influence of Nikolai Gogol's \"Dead Souls\", published in the 1st volume of Count Vladimir Sollogub's \"Yesterday and Today\" almanac. The 2nd volume featured \"Amena\", a novella, described as an extract from a novel called \"Stebelovsky\" which remained unfinished. Belinsky responded negatively to this publication, describing the piece as \"rather dull\", and an \"unfortunate manifestation of mental irritation picked from Chateaubriand\" (meaning apparently \"Les Martyrs\", 1809).\n\nThroughout the 1840s Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees and fleeting romances. He was described as \"a handsome young man with blonde hair and a freshly coloured face\" and was renowned for his physical strength, \"bending spoons, forks and horse-shoes and driving nails into walls with one finger.\" One notable business trip to Kaluga in 1850 led to a close friendship with Nikolai Gogol (whom he first met in Frankfurt and then in Rome). Tolstoy recited to Gogol many of his yet unpublished poems and fragments from what later became the novel \"Prince Serebryany\". Gogol read him the second part of his novel \"Dead Souls\". Among other friendships he struck up in the forties were those with Ivan Aksakov, Pavel Annenkov, Nikolai Nekrasov, Ivan Panaev and Ivan Turgenev.\n\nIn the early 1850s, in collaboration with the Zhemchuzhnikov brothers, Tolstoy created the fictional writer Kozma Prutkov, a petty bureaucrat with great self-esteem who parodied the poetry of the day and soon became famous for his utterly banal aphorisms. In 1851 Prutkov debuted with \"The Fantasy\" a comedy which was signed \"Y\" and \"Z\" and written by Tolstoy and Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov. The play, mocking the then popular \"nonsense\" vaudeville premiered on January 8 in the Alexandrinsky Theatre. This spectacular farce (featuring at one point a dozen small dogs running about on stage) caused a huge scandal, was promptly banned by Nikolay I (who was among the audience) and remained unpublished until 1884.\n\nIt was also in 1851 that Tolstoy first met Sophia Andreyevna Miller (1827?–1892), the wife of a cavalry colonel (whom she later divorced with great difficulty) and an impressively well-educated woman who knew fourteen languages, at a Bolshoy Theater masquerade. Tolstoy fell in love with her but had to wait for another twelve years before they were able to marry. Miller had, apparently, a perfect artistic taste and Tolstoy later referred to her as his harshest and most objective critic, as well as the best friend he'd ever had. All of his love lyrics from 1851 onwards were written for and about Sophia. Many of his poems (\"My dear bluebells\", \"Amidst the ball uproar\", \"Brighter than the skylark's singing\", \"The wind from high up, it is not...\") have been set to music by renowned composers and have become famous Russian romances.\n\nIn 1854 \"Sovremennik\" magazine published several of Tolstoy's verses (\"My bluebells\", \"Oh you haystacks...\" and others), which instantly got critics talking, and also the first of Kozma Prutkov's humorously pompous poetic exercises. The latter was not so much a collective pseudonym, as a character who was making quite a point of coming across as a \"real\" creature, performing, among other things, obnoxious pranks, one of which involved a messenger visiting all the leading Saint Petersburg architects late at night with the urgent news of the Isaakiyevsky Cathedral having fallen down and urging them to appear early next morning at the court of Tsar Nikolay I, which they hastily did, to the Tsar's utter annoyance.\n\nAs the Crimea War broke out, Tolstoy's first intention was to gather a partisan fighting unit and lead it to the Baltic Sea, should the English decide to land there. Along with Count Aleksey Bobrinsky (future Minister of transport) he started to finance and equip two partisan squads, forty fighters each. He bought some ammunition from Tula and traveled all along the Baltic coastline, examining what was supposed to be his future theater of war, the Crown Prince being totally unaware of his plans. On 2 September the allies landed at Yevpatoria and Tolstoy headed South, to join the Imperial infantry regiment (under the command of Lev Perovsky, another of his uncles) as an army major, in March 1855. The regiment went only as far as Odessa where a thousand men were lost from typhoid. In February 1856 Tolstoy became one of the casualties. In Odessa he was nursed back to health by Sophia Miller. Alexander II was telegraphed daily on the subject of his old friend's condition, at his personal request. In May 1855 Tolstoy was back on his feet, but the war was over for him; he instead embarked upon a Crimean journey with Sophia.\n\nAfter the War, in 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy as one of his personal aide-de-camp. It was only three years later that Tolstoy managed to get rid of this tiresome privilege which implied regular duties in the Palace, interfering with his now burgeoning literary career. \"You cannot imagine what a storm of rhymes rages in me, what waves of poetry are sweeping through me, longing to break free,\" he wrote in a letter to Sophia Miller. Two thirds of Tolstoy's poetic legacy was created in the late 1850s. 1857 saw the publication of a large poem called \"The Sinner\". It was followed by the more significant \"Ioann Damaskin\", first published in \"Russkaya Beseda\" January 1859 issue. The poem, dealing with the nature of poetry and the poet's position in society, but also hinting at the author's personal plight, caused scandal. The head of the 3rd Department Prince Vasily Dolgorukov ordered the printing of the magazine to be stopped and for the poem to be removed. The Minister of Education Evgraf Kovalevsky personally permitted the publication, his rather daring decision causing a serious rift between the two departments.\n\nTolstoy's poems were appearing in virtually all the major Russian magazines of the time, regardless of their ideological inclinations. Yet, in 1857 his relationship with the leftist \"Sovremennik\" group became strained. Tolstoy drifted towards the Slavophiles and their \"Russkaya Beseda\" magazine, becoming a close friend of Ivan Aksakov and Aleksey Khomyakov, but this liaison was short-lived too. In the 1860s he found himself in a strange position of being a highly popular author, criticized fiercely both from the left and from the right. As to the reasons for this, A.K. Tolstoy was never in doubt. In an autobiographical letter to Angelo de Gubernatis he wrote: \nTolstoy caused much controversy with his scathing remarks aimed at contemporary government officials (Alexander Timashev, Vladimir Butkov, Ivan Veillot) whom he – a supporter of the monarch – considered real enemies of the State. He also criticized the activities of the 3rd Department, and in the wake of the Polish uprising was one of the very few people in the Court to openly denounce Muravyov the Hangman's draconian methods of political repression.\n\nA fierce opponent of xenophobia, he saw Russia as a European country, and Russians as Europeans. This clashed with the Slavophile doctrine of maintaining Russia's \"special place\" in the world. \"[Speaking] of slavophiles, Khomyakov sickens me when he places [Russia] above the West just on the strength of our being Orthodox,\" Tolstoy wrote in a letter. All the while, well-publicized was his dispute with Turgenev, who saw the French state as Russia's potential guiding light. \"What France is moving towards is the dictatorship of mediocrity,\" Tolstoy argued. Being neither a westernizer nor a slavophile, Tolstoy annoyed both parties by his infatuation with pre-Tatar Russian society which he idealized whole-heartedly, seeing it as an Eastern strain of European knighthood, based on the cult of the nobleman. Also causing controversy were Tolstoy's critique of the West's amoral pragmatism and socialist ideas, his dismissal of the Russian imperial ideals which he saw as tragically flawed, and his own doctrine of a centralized Russia, the vile Moscovia State being, in his view, at the root of all Russian political evil. This eclectic \"political romanticism\" appeared to be in conflict with every political and social trend of the time.\n\nTolstoy rejected some ecclesiastical teachings, calling them the \"church's argo\" and believed in God as a \"higher being\" and cosmic mind. \"I believe God gave us the power of emotion so we could go further than our mind leads us. As a leading force, human emotion is preferable to a thought, just as music is more perfect than a spoken word,\" he wrote.\n\nIn 1861 Tolstoy quit the Court. \"For quite some time I was under the illusion that I'd be able to suppress my artistic nature but life taught me different; this struggle was futile. Service and the arts are incompatible,\" he wrote in a letter to disappointed Alexander II. \"Tolstoy represented a rare type of man who not only evaded by every possible means the favours and laurels that came his way, but had to go through painfully tedious battles with people who, driven by the best of intentions, were imposing every opportunity of making a brilliant career on him,\" wrote literary historian and BEED biographer Semyon Vengerov in 1903.\n\nFrom then on the writer's visits to the Palace became rare, but he used each one as an opportunity to \"speak the truth regardless,\" as he put it. In 1862 Tolstoy solicited for Ivan Aksakov who'd been banned from editing his \"Den\" (The Day) newspaper. A year later he helped Ivan Turgenev out of an exile the latter found himself in after having contacted the \"London propagandists\", as Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Ogarev were then known. In 1864 Tolstoy tried to exert his influence upon Alexander II to make him alleviate the plight of the imprisoned Chernyshevsky. Asked by the Tsar for the latest news in the world of literature, Tolstoy said: \"The whole of Russia has gone into mourning for Chernyshevsky to whom an injustice has been done...\" - \"No, Tolstoy, I beg you never to remind me of Chernyshevsky, please,\" the monarch hastily retorted. This aborted conversation, as it happened, brought to an end a friendship that had lasted for forty years.\n\nTolstoy's historical novel \"Prince Serebrenni\" (1862, \"Russky Vestnik\"), set during the time of Ivan the Terrible, was widely popular and was translated into many languages. The novel premiered at a recital evening in the Palace, and brought its author a book-trinket from the Empress consort Maria Aleksandrovna, who greatly admired Tolstoy, both as writer and a person. His poetic drama \"Don Juan\", published the same year, was less successful: even if not officially banned, it wasn't staged in its author's lifetime and made its theatrical debut only in 1905, severely cut by censors. \nKozma Prutkov aside, Tolstoy wrote satirical verses under his own name, the best known of which was the Karamzin-inspired \"History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev\" (1868), a parody on Russian history that focused on the vicious characteristics of Russian monarchs. Another satirical poem, \"The Dream of Councillor Popov\", written in the summer of 1873, spread across Russia in hand-written form and became hugely popular. Both Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev expressed their delight at this personal swipe at the Interior Minister Pyotr Valuyev, and a mockery in general of a conservative bureaucrat trying to come across as a liberal. The poem came out in 1878, in Berlin, as a brochure, then six years later was reprinted by \"Russkaya Starina\" (No.12, 1884). 1867 saw the release of \"Poems\", the vast collection of Tolstoy's verse (all in all, 131 pieces), the only such compilation published in his lifetime.\n\nTolstoy's lasting contribution to Russian literature was a trilogy of historical dramas (modelled after Alexander Pushkin's \"Boris Godunov\"): \"The Death of Ivan the Terrible\", \"Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich\", and \"Tsar Boris\". \"The Death of Ivan the Terrible\", published in 1866 in \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\" magazine, was staged the following year in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and some provincial theaters and enjoyed massive success, but after 1870 was virtually banned and got revived on stage only in the late 1890s. \"Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich\" (1868, \"Vestnik Evropy\") was banned from being produced on stage personally by Interior minister Timashev; as late as 1907 censors deemed the play \"inappropriate.\" \"Tsar Boris\" (1870, \"Vestnik Evropy\") received no official ban, but the Directorial council of the Imperial Theatres refused to sanction its production. In 1871 Tolstoy started his fifth and final play called \"Posadnik\" (set in the times when the Novgorod Republic prospered), which remained unfinished. Parts of it were published in \"Skladchina\", an 1874 charity almanac, the rest appeared in \"Vestnik Evropy\" in 1876, after the author's death.\n\nTolstoy was lenient land-owner, admired by his Krasny Rog peasants who were permitted to use his fields as common pastures and given free timber and primary education for their children in a school he built for them in 1859. In 1861 he personally gathered all of his peasants together, read them the Emancipation reform of 1861 decree, gave money to everybody present and participated in the grandiose drinking spree that followed. Being a lavish spender and having no knowledge of the practical side of life, by the end of the 1860s he found himself on the verge of bankruptcy, but loathed the idea of returning to the Tsar's Court.\n\nEver since the mid-1860s Tolstoy had fallen more and more out of sync with Russian cultural life, feeling acutely his ideological and spiritual isolation. Referring to himself as an 'anchorite', he spent most of his time in Pustynka (near Saint Petersburg) and his Krasny Rog estate, worsening financial situation and deteriorating health adding to his troubles. Tired of fighting his many opponents, totally disillusioned with what he saw around him, A. K. Tolstoy wrote to his friend Boleslav Markevich in 1869:\nA.K.Tolstoy entered the 1870s as a very sick man, suffering from asthma, angina pectoris, neuralgias and severe headaches. Regular visits to European medics only temporarily alleviated his conditions. In the spring of 1875 Tolstoy started taking morphine. \"Now I'm feeling much better, at least the neuralgia's gone. But never before have I been so short of breath. Asthma fits are continuous,\" he complained in a letter to poet Karolina Pavlova (who was also a translator of his dramas) on 8 July 1875.\n\nAleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy died on September 28, 1875, in Krasny Rog, Chernigov Governorate, after having given himself a lethal injection of morphine. He was buried in the family vault in the Uspenskaya Church in Krasny Rog.\n\nTolstoy represented the later period of Romanticism in Russian literature; art for him was a mystic link between the human world and the higher spheres where \"eternal ideas dwell.\" Along with Afanasy Fet, his artistic and spiritual ally, he saw Art as a higher science, man's only instrument for a true and comprehensive understanding of the world. Romantic tendencies were best realised in Tolstoy's poetry and in some of his dramas, notably \"Don Juan\" where the hero is on quest for a romantic ideal, looking everywhere for love \"that helps one penetrate into the wonderful universal laws, our world's hidden beginnings,\" as he put it. \"Art can only be a 'means' – all of the 'ends'... it contains in itself,\" Tolstoy wrote in 1870, in the course of long dispute with those whom he labeled \"utilitarianists in literature\". Such views automatically made him a \"conservative\" in the eyes of the revolutionary democrats who formed a large majority in the Russian literary circles of the 1850s and 1860s. Unlike Fet, though, Tolstoy insisted on the artist's total independence from ideology and politics, and felt himself totally free to criticize and mock authorities, a trait that snubbed many people in high places.\n\nTolstoy's poetry had certain qualities that made it unusual and even unique, one being the \"half-spoken\" nature of the verse. \"It's good for poetry when a thought is only half-fulfilled, so that readers can complete it – each in their own way,\" he explained in a letter to Sophia Miller in 1854. This view translated into a technique of writing. One of the things Tolstoy was criticized and even jeered for were \"bad rhymes\" which he used consciously, as part of his \"poetic system\". \"Imperfect rhyming, if kept in bounds of course, can be seen as corresponding to the Venetian school in painting which with little imperfections, or should I say, carelessnesses, could achieve the kind of effects which Raphael wouldn't dream of for all of his precision,\" Tolstoy wrote in 1859. In fact, Tolstoy, as I. Yampolsky pointed out, was a master of versification. Consciously imposed \"careless\" rhyming gave his poems an improvisational tone (with \"an impression of thoughts being put to paper exactly in the form they were born\") but behind it there was hard work and much editing. \"Tolstoy's verse is so simple it hardly rises above prose, yet the poetic impression it carries is perfectly full,\" critic Nikolay Strakhov wrote in 1867. Another unusual feature of Tolstoy's poems was the fact that, while rather salon-like and graceful both in nature and form, they were full of 'simplistic' bits borrowed freely from common talk and traditional Russian folklore. Kept in perfect balance, these tinged his verse with a peculiar, musical quality. More than half of Tolstoy's poems have been put to music by leading Russian composers like Tchaykovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Musorgsky, Mily Balakirev, Cesar Cui, Anton Rubinstein, Sergey Rakhmaninov and others. \"Tolstoy is the unfathomable well of poems crying for music. For me he is one of the most attractive poets,\" wrote Tchaykovsky.\n\nAssessing Tolstoy's poetry as a whole, D.S.Mirsky wrote: \"Even if they suffer from sentimentality and are occasionally banal, his lyrics retain their freshness and even now taste like a delightful morning dew,\" the critic wrote.\n\nInnokenty Annensky saw Tolstoy's poetry as being the perfect expression of \"pure love\", the \"human soul's inner beauty\" being the poet's ideal. \"Tolstoy never wrote for children but his crystal clear idealism, tinged with mysticism, made his poetry resonate well with the period in adolescence when the human soul reaches out to something high and indescribable,\" Annensky wrote. Mentioning Nekrasov, who in his latter works created a strong image of the Russian mother, Annensky argued that what Tolstoy managed to create was an equally sublime portrait of the noble woman whose \"serene placidity belies unspeakable sadness… of the one who's ashamed of her own happiness fearing that she, making the most of this world's beauty, somehow takes it away from those who have no opportunity to enjoy such riches in abundance.\"\n\nTolstoy's ballads and songs were close to traditional bylinas both in essence and form; in fact, the author himself made no distinction between the two genres. Critics argued that (unlike, say, Nekrasov) Tolstoy used folklorisms as a mere stylistic instrument, using stories from the history of the Russian Middle Ages as a means to convey his own ideas and theories (\"Zmei Tugarin\"), and to link historical utopias with relevant social comment (\"Boryvoi\", \"Vasily Shibanov\"). Tolstoy tended to greatly idealise Russia's pre-Mongol past which made the traditional bylina characters almost superheroes. \"It's hard to recognize Alyosha Popovich, eyes-a-jealous, hands-a-grabbin'- as a romantic youth, speaking of love and devotion to his beloved,\" Semyon Vengerov remarked. Likewise, the fearsome Ilya Muromets who came across as a rather violent, dangerous and often sacrilegious type in folk bylinas, was portrayed by Tolstoy as a \"benign grandfather figure,\" rather gracious and well-spoken.\n\nCritic Yuly Aykhenvald derided Tolstoy's insistence on continuing with his \"nationalistic masquerade\" and quoted Anton Chekhov as commenting: \"[Tolstoy] has put the opera costume on and forgotten to take it off before leaving the theatre.\" According to Aykhenvald, Tolstoy failed to see that \"the national values, when taken to the extreme, become alien-looking.\" For Aykhenvald, though, it was Tolstoy's humour that prevented him from turning into an \"archeology worshipper\". The critic saw Tolstoy's romanticism as universal and in a certain way religious (resulting in the fact that his most memorable character, Tsar Fyodor was \"an epitome of Christian meekness and grace\"). Yet, \"[Tolstoy] worshipped that kind of God who was devoid of stiffness... he was a free spirit and valued freedom most.\"\n\nTolstoy's sense of humour was best realised in Kozma Prutkov's extraordinary aphorisms, as well as in his own satirical poems. \"Tolstoy... without any doubt, is Russia's greatest absurdist poet,\" wrote Mirsky. \"The Dream of Councillor Popov\" and \"History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev\", his best known satires, were spread across Russia in manuscript, gaining huge popularity amongst all social strata. According to Mirsky, \"The Dream\" is \"the acme of Russian humorous poetry, mixing sharp, poignant satire... and pure delight in cheerful absurdity\". It's \"The Dream\" that can be seen as Aleksey Tolstoy's most solid claim for immortality,\" the critic argued, mentioning \"The Uproar in the Vatican\" as another of his humorous masterpieces.\n\nTolstoy's anti-leftist, pro-conservative sarcasm, on the other hand, received much stick from the 'democratic' press. His \"Ballad With a Tendency\" was bitterly criticised by Saltykov-Schedrin while \"\" magazine parodied it in 1872 with a verse entitled \"A Ballad with a Pro-Police Tendency\". Shchedrin, describing the current state of Russian literature as a \"kingdom of scoundrels\", in a letter to Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov wrote: \"Add to all this the fun-and-games-seeking 'free artists' like Count A. K. Tolstoy who makes... our obscurantists' hearts beat faster with delight. I don't know about you, but I find it painful to see how people whom I though honest, even if not very far-seeing, fight on the side of obscurantism, employing pseudo-folklorism as a weapon.\"\n\nTolstoy was a master of prose; both his novella \"The Vampire\" (praised by Vissarion Belinsky) and his novel \"Prince Serebrenni\" received a lot of good press. The latter, though, was criticised for being tendentious; many argued that both the main character and Yelena Morozova looked very much like people of the 19th, rather than 16th century. On the other hand, Ivan Grozny and the oprichnina horrors were depicted with great vividness and passion; the novel's masterfully built structure, its rich musical language made it a perfect Walter Scott-type of book for adolescents, according to Vengerov. \"The novel is highly involving… finely structured and well-written,\" Ivan Turgenev wrote, recommending it to a French publisher. Still, as a prosaic Tolstoy made much less of an impact than as a poet. He’s been lauded as a classic of the 19th century Russian historical drama. D. S. Mirsky regarded Tolstoy as a dramatist superior to Aleksander Ostrovsky, describing his plays as \"full of intriguing ideas and brilliantly crafted characters. They impress us with intelligence and insight rather than with flights of imagination, but in \"Tsar Fyodor\" Tolstoy managed to create one of the most interesting characters in Russian literature: that of a kind and weak ruler who has a keen sense of justice but is unable to make his evil aids implement his good will.\"\n\nCritics noted, though, that history as such was secondary to Tolstoy; he was driven mostly by his own personal views and feelings, tending to judge his 16th century characters using mid-19th century moral values. \"The life of today seeps through everywhere,\" Tolstoy himself admitted, speaking of his ballads. According to the author, historical drama had to be \"true\" only in a \"humanist way\". \"A poet... has just one responsibility: to his own poetic self... human truth is his one law. Historical truth is something he is not bound to. If it fits into the concept, very good, if not, he can easily do without it,\" he wrote. So on the one hand, Tolstoy's dramatic trilogy- \"The Death of Ivan the Terrible\", \"Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich\" and \"Tsar Boris\"- was not historical in the strict sense of the word; on the other hand, it was far from being the brand of \"patriotic drama\" produced by Nestor Kukolnik or the imitation of the French \"tragedie des allusions\" which Aleksander Pushkin ridiculed. In fact, Pushkin's attitude was the closest approximation to that of Tolstoy. The latter's plays had their \"second levels\", directly corresponding to contemporary political situations, but were driven mostly by the author's historical views and theories which involved the glorifying of Russian \"noble men\" (he associated them with the boyarstvo) and the vilification Ivan Grozny whom the boyarstvo had fallen victim to.\n\nPavel Annenkov considered Ioann and Fyodor as \"loosely based upon\" characters, being perfectly fine but only in representing their era, not their own historical selves. \"They are as loose as King Lear or Hamlet were and, if they do belong more to Russian history than those two belong to English history, that is because no other reality than that of our Old Russia could have inspired [Tolstoy] in such a way, bringing him such colors, such an essence to freely draw from,\" the critic wrote. It was the generic closeness of Tolstoy's plays to the Russia of old, Annenkov argued, that made them historic in the truest sense of the word, for \"their significance as living testimony to the spirit those people and their times is beyond doubt\".\n\nCommon to the trilogy was a somewhat morbid look at the history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: \"God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the result of our disintegration!\" (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), \"I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!\" (Tsar Fyodor), \"What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else.\" (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were \"united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia,\" had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to \"Tsar Boris\" in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left \"supported\" boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.\nAll three plays became part of the repertoire of the leading Russian and Soviet theaters, notably the Maly Theatre, with stars like Ivan Moskvin, Pavel Olenev, Stepan Kuznetsov and Nikolai Khmelyov in the leading roles. According to I. Yampolsky, Tolstoy the dramatist, even if not on par with Pushkin, was high above his contemporaries; he created complex, multi-dimensional historical figures. \"In the arts, to be wary of showing weaknesses in your favourite characters is to pay them bad service... Thus one can only succeed in creating faceless dummies whom nobody would believe in,\" Tolstoy wrote.\n\nIn the mid-19th century Tolstoy was not taken very seriously, but his reputation started to grow after his death in 1875. Vladimir Korolenko called \"Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich\" \"a gem of Russian drama,\" that's been shining especially bright next to \"the totally dismal theater repertoire of the late 19th century\".\n\nTolstoy was highly valued by Aleksander Blok and Valery Bryusov; Ivan Bunin, otherwise harsh in his comments on fellow writers, rated him very high; Velemir Khlebnikov mentioned him among his all-time favourites and, most surprisingly (according to Korney Chukovsky), Vladimir Mayakovsky knew his poetry by heart and often recited it in public. Both Tolstoy's poetry (the larger part of which has been transformed into classic romance) and his historical drama trilogy are regarded as an intrinsic part of the classic Russian literature of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n"}

While working on the project, he was nearly killed in an accident at the Philadelphia Naval Yard where a prototype thermal diffusion isotope separation device was being constructed. The priest of the Philadelphia Naval Yard offered last rites to Kramish, who refused, as he was Jewish. After World War II, he wrote numerous books on nuclear issues. He is perhaps best known for his book \"The Griffin - the greatest untold espionage story of World War II\", about Paul Rosbaud, who passed important scientific and military information from Germany to the Allies.\n\nKramish was born on June 6, 1923, in Denver and received his undergraduate degree in 1945 from the University of Denver. He moved on to Harvard University, where he majored in physics and was awarded a master's degree in 1947.\n\nWhile still in college, Kramish was assigned to work on the Manhattan Project, working in the special engineering division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico and at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. While working on a test in Philadelphia on September 2, 1944, Kramish was critically injured in the explosion of uranium enrichment equipment. Two chemists were killed immediately and two soldiers received severe burns in the accident, which occurred while they were trying to unclog an enrichment device which exploded, releasing steam laced with uranium hexafluoride and hydrofluoric acid. Kramish would later call the blast \"perhaps then the largest release in history of radioactive materials\".\n\nSeverely injured and losing consciousness, Kramish declined the assistance of a priest who was offering to administer Last Rites. While recuperating from the severe burns from the incident at a Philadelphia naval hospital, his mother came to visit him by train from Denver, carrying with her a jar of chicken soup on the three-day trip, which she fed him upon her arrival at the hospital, which Kramish would credit for his unexpected recovery. Despite wartime censorship of any details of the incident and secret classification after the war ended, Kramish lobbied the government to memorialize the victims of the accident.\n\nAfter World War II, Kramish worked for the Atomic Energy Commission as a liaison to the Central Intelligence Agency providing intelligence estimates on Soviet nuclear capabilities and worked with Edward Teller on the design and development of the Hydrogen bomb. Physicist Samuel Cohen credited Kramish with being one of the first to obtain accurate information about Soviet efforts and making his best efforts to pass on that knowledge to senior officials. He assisted in the interrogation of David Greenglass, who was one of the atomic spies for the Soviet Union together with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. He was later employed as a nuclear weapons research strategist by the RAND Corporation.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Kramish was an adviser to the United States Department of State in Paris, and during the 1980s he served as the chair of a study for the Reagan administration that recommended pursuing the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative as a means to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. He was also an advisor to UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on nuclear arms control and security issues.\n\nKramish became a historian of the atomic era, writing \"The Griffin - The greatest untold espionage story of World War II\", about a spy who passed information to the British about the German nuclear energy project to develop an atom bomb for Nazi Germany, using information he gathered from some 500 interviews. In a review of the book, \"The Washington Post\" reviewer expressed his regret that \"it is an ironic tribute to this bookish spy's mastery of his trade that the Griffin remains a surprisingly shadowy figure\". Though he was frequently contacted as a source for history about the Manhattan Project and the history of the nuclear arms race, Robert Norris of the Natural Resources Defense Council regretted that he was not \"more forthcoming and generous in sharing what he knew\".\n\nA resident of Reston, Virginia, Kramish died at age 87 on June 15, 2010, at George Washington University Hospital due to normal pressure hydrocephalus. He was survived by his wife, Vivian Raker, a daughter, a son, a sister, and four grandchildren.\n\n"}
{"id": "49513836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49513836", "title": "Balbo Monument", "text": "Balbo Monument\n\nThe Balbo Monument consists of a column that is approximately 2,000 years old dating from between 117 and 38 BCE and a contemporary stone base. It was taken from an ancient port town outside of Rome by Benito Mussolini and gifted to the city of Chicago in 1933 to honor General Italo Balbo's trans-Atlantic flight to the Century of Progress Worlds Fair.\n\nThe Balbo Monument includes a column that was taken from a site about 200 meters outside of Porta Marina in Ostia. The building that the column originated from is called the Prospetto a Mare which translates to the Prospectus to Sea. Due to extensive renovation that was done during the second century AD, many of the buildings throughout the settlement of Ostia were repurposed or built over. Although this building endured through years of change and innovation, there are very few records still in existence that pertain to the building's original purpose. Not far from Rome, Ostia is a harbor town that was founded by a king of Rome who ruled in the late seventh century BC. Knowledge of this first settlement did not arise from archaeological finds but texts written by sources such as Ennius, Livius, Cicero and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. In antiquity, the settlement sat at the mouth of the River Tiber but has since receded from the shoreline due to silting that occurred throughout the centuries.\n\nWhile it may have started off as a colonial outpost, Ostia has been rebuilt and reinvented many times. In the 3rd century BC it was a naval base which participated heavily in the Punic Wars. Commercialization occurred later on in the 2nd century BC when grain became the main commodity that was transported through the port. There is little information about the town from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC due to rebuilding but it is known that well to do merchant families began to rule over Ostia in the latter half of the 1st century BC. This carried on well into the 2nd century AD after which Rome retook control over the city and began renovations that would cause Ostia's rise in popularity. The city rapidly became densely populated with a large international population and many types of buildings were erected. According to archaeological reports of the sites, there was a large variety of structures ranging from three-story apartment buildings, brothels, bars, shops and bakeries to baths, temples, shrines and sculptures.\n\nThe Romans built the structure and column from breccia which is a type of stone created from the combination of angular gravel and the fragments of boulders. The pillar is a greenish color, thirteen feet tall and three feet in diameter. Two Italian architects named Capraro and Komar created the base of the monument out of travertine, which is a type of lightly colored limestone that is formed when river and spring waters evaporate. They inscribed a message in Italian from the Italian people of Fascist Italy. In English the message reads:\n\n<poem></poem>\n\nThis object's purpose and meaning has experienced drastic transformations throughout the centuries. It went from being a piece of a building that had a very functional purpose in a thriving community to a ruin that a dictator pilfered. Benito Mussolini removed the pillar from its original place in order to create a monument that produced mixed emotions from people in the U.S. and abroad. The monument represents a portion of history but it is also valued as a piece of art and it stands as a symbol that has very different meanings for different groups of people.\n\nAfter Benito Mussolini had the pillar removed from its original place in Ostia, he had it converted into a monument that he gifted to the City of Chicago. It was transported by boat to America and arrived in Chicago in 1934 during the Century of Progress World's fair and placed in front of the Italian Pavilion. While the fair was eventually disassembled, the column was left standing in its original place just a short distance from the shores of Lake Michigan in an often overlooked area of Burnham Park. This token was a tribute to the first transatlantic crossing made by the Italian air force and their general, Italo Balbo. At the time of this celebration, many Italians and Americans thought that this gift was a symbol of growing positive relations between Italy and America. For others, it was seen as proof that the U.S. was condoning terrorism and murder. After WWII, The Italian ambassador to the U.S. recommended that all symbols of admiration for Fascist Italy be removed. As is evident from its current existence, Balbo's pillar endured in spite of intermittent objections. There are still mixed emotions that survive to this day. Some believe the monument to be a controversial link to Fascism while older Chicago residents hold on to fond memories of an age of progress.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53594388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53594388", "title": "Child health and nutrition in Africa", "text": "Child health and nutrition in Africa\n\nChild health and nutrition in Africa is concerned with the health care of children through adolescents in the various countries of Africa. The right to health and a nutritious and sufficient diet are internationally recognized fundamental human rights protected by international treaties and conventions on the right to life, as well as in charters, strategies and declarations. Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1, 4, 5 and 6 highlight, respectively, how poverty, hunger, child mortality, maternal health, the eradication of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases are of particular significance in the context of child health.\n\nDespite these commitments and ideals, however, the reality is that high mortality among young children, particularly in Africa, continues to be a cause for concern. Children born in developed countries such as Sweden have a less than 1 per cent risk of dying before the age of 1 year, whereas for children born in developing countries, the risk is closer to 10 per cent or higher. Within developing countries, there are significant disparities between rich and poor and urban and rural areas.\n\nWorldwide, substantial progress has been made in the effort to reduce child mortality. The number of under-5 deaths in the world has declined from nearly 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011; and the global under-five mortality rate has dropped 41 per cent since 1990 – from 87 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 51 in 2011. The leading causes of death among children under age 5 are pneumonia (18 per cent), preterm birth complications (14 per cent), diarrhoea (11 per cent), complications during birth (9 per cent), and malaria (7 per cent). Globally, more than one third of under-5 deaths are attributable to undernutrition.\n\nIn Africa, some progress has also been registered over the decades. Compared to other regions, sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a faster rate of reduction in under-5 deaths, with the annual rate of decline doubling between 1990-2000 and 2000-2011. However, child mortality figures in sub-Saharan Africa are still sobering. The region alone accounts for 3,370,000 deaths of children under 5 in 2011 (WHO, 2012) which corresponds to 9,000 children dying every day, and six children dying every minute. Out of 3 million neonatal deaths worldwide, approximately 1.1 million are found in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2012). The highest rates of child mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, where 1 in 9 children dies before age 5; and 1 in 16 children in Southern Asia.\n\nGiven that vitamin A is critical for proper functioning of the visual system and for maintaining immune defences, its deficiency remains a public health issue. An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children deficient in vitamin A become blind every year, half of them dying within 12 months of losing their sight. This deficiency accounts for 350 million cases of blindness and 670,000 deaths globally (WHO, 2001). In Africa alone, it contributes to 23 per cent of child deaths. In 2009, the prevalence of low serum retinol, associated with vitamin A deficiency, was 37.7 per cent in Ethiopia, 49 per cent in the Congo, and 42 per cent in Madagascar. The immediate causes of this deficiency are the low rates of consumption of animal products, the poor bioavailability of vitamin A in cereal-based diets, the consumption of green leaves with low lipid content, and an increased bodily demand for vitamin A owing to the infections that frequently affect African children (Manga, 2011).\n\nThere are equally disturbing levels of zinc deficiencies and this has seriously adverse effects on growth, the risk and severity of infections, as well as the level of immune function. Although the actual prevalence is unclear, zinc deficiency is recognized as one of the main risk factors for morbidity and mortality. It contributes to over 450,000 deaths per year among children under 5 years, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It affected 57 per cent of children under 5 in Senegal, 72 per cent in Burkina Faso, and 41.5 per cent in Nigeria in 2004. The main causes of this deficiency in children are a lack of zinc-rich easily absorbed foodstuffs (such as meat, poultry, seafood) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs that inhibit zinc absorption, such as cereals, roots and tubers, which are among Africa’s staples.\n\nInadequacies in iodine intake on the other hand impair the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which are critical for normal development and proper functioning of the brain and nervous system as well as the conservation of body heat and energy. Iodine deficiency causes endemic goitre and cretinism as well as stunting of mental and physical development. Globally, 1.6 million people are at risk of iodine deficiency disorders and 50 million children affected by them. About 100,000 children are born each year with mental retardation, most of them in Africa. This is due to the low consumption of iodine-rich foodstuffs (e.g. marine products) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs causing goitre, particularly bitter cassava, which is a staple in Central Africa.\n\nAnaemia is quite prevalent in Africa especially among young children due mainly to a diet that is low in animal-based foodstuffs and high in fibre-rich cereals, tannins and phytates which inhibit iron absorption. In 2006, about 67.6 per cent of children under 5, and overall 83.5 million children were anaemic. Through its effects on metabolic processes such as oxygen transport, oxidative metabolism and cell growth, iron deficiency also retards growth and development. It impairs the immune response and increases susceptibility to infection, delays motor development, and diminishes concentration (impairing cognitive and behavioural capacities). It therefore prevents 40-60 per cent of African children from attaining their full mental capacities. Moreover, of the 26 health risks reported by the WHO Global Burden of Disease project, iron deficiency is ranked ninth in terms of years of life lost.\n\nBreast milk is the ideal natural food for optimal growth and safe psychomotor development. This is due to its rich nutrients and protective factors, as well as its biospecificity (the kinetics of its composition change during lactation) and impact on mother-child relationships. These key advantages reduce child mortality rate by 13 per cent in areas where over 80 per cent of women breastfeed exclusively.\n\nUndernourished children have lowered resistance to infection and are at greater risk of common childhood diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, recurring sickness and faltering growth, often with irreversible damage to their cognitive and social development. For current and future generations, good nutrition is a cornerstone for survival, health and development. Well-nourished children set off on a better developmental path (both physically and mentally), perform better in school, grow into healthier adults and are able to give their own children a better start in life. Supplementary feeding, when properly implemented, helps to reduce the mortality rate of children under 5 by 6 per cent.\n\nThe prevention of malaria through the use of LLINs is a key strategy for rolling back malaria in Africa. According to model-generated estimates based on the number of LLINs supplied by the manufacturers, the number distributed by national malaria control programmes and data from household surveys, the percentage of households with at least one LLIN in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 3 per cent in 2000 to 50 per cent in 2011. Coverage rates of more than 80 per cent can reduce Africa’s child mortality rate by 7 per cent.\n\nHib, meningitis and respiratory infections are frequent and serious on account of their high mortality rates and potential consequences, which include sensorineural damage. These infections can be prevented by vaccination to reduce child mortality by 4 per cent. Hib vaccination is part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) together with vaccines against tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, measles and yellow fever. EPI is a key preventive intervention in reducing infant morbidity and mortality; together with the monitoring and promotion of growth, it is a fundamental pillar in child health and development.\n\nThe 25 per cent prevalence of HIV in some eastern and southern African countries is a matter of concern. African countries that showed more than 20 per cent adult HIV prevalence in 2011 included Botswana (23.4 per cent), Lesotho (23.3 per cent) and Swaziland (26 per cent) (UNICEF, 2013). Globally, the number of new HIV infections continues to fall annually, although there is considerable regional variation. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most of those newly infected with HIV live, it is estimated that 1.9 million (1,700,000 – 2,100,000) people were infected in 2010. According to estimates, this represents a 16 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections with HIV in 2001, which was 2.2 million (2,100,000-2,400,000), and a 27 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections between 1996 and 1998, when the incidence of HIV infection in the region peaked.\n\nThe vast majority of children are infected before birth, during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding (if the mother is seropositive). The course of HIV and AIDS is particularly aggressive in children. Without care and treatment, the virus multiplies and destroys the child’s immune system, lowering resistance to infections such as pneumonia and other common childhood diseases. Almost half of all children infected by their mothers die before the age of 2.Thanks to a decrease in the price of drugs, increased awareness, the introduction of fixed-dose combinations of anti-retrovirals (ARVs) and more reliable forecasts of demand for paediatric ARVs, several countries have been able to distribute them for use in children, but the coverage rate remains extremely low in Africa.\n\nFood fortification is a cost effective way of ensuring that a population receives adequate nutrients without altering their usual dietary practices. WHO recommends mass fortification of salt with iodine to prevent iodine deficiency in both children and adults. Fortification of other foods such as flour and cooking oil has been suggested and implemented in some countries, but salt iodization has been the most successful in terms of implementation and benefits in Sub Saharan Africa. Micronutrient powders (MNPs) for point of use fortification, contain a mixture of vitamins and minerals. They are added on to ready to eat semi solid foods such as porridge, without altering the original taste. This intervention reduces iron deficiency anaemia in children between six and twenty-three months of age\n\nThe role of zinc in strengthening immune defences cannot be underestimated and in areas where effective preventive supplementation campaigns have been implemented, particularly in Africa, the child mortality rate has been lowered by 4 per cent.\n\nBiannual vitamin A supplements can help to reduce mortality among young children by 23 per cent.\n\nOral rehydration is considered one of the greatest revolutions in improving child health and managing diarrhoea. With new oral rehydration solutions containing zinc, child mortality can be reduced by 15 per cent.\n\nF75 and F100 are types of therapeutic milk that is used in inpatient management of severe acute malnutrition. They differ in concentrations of ingredients and amount of energy. Ready to use therapeutic foods (RTUF) are semi-solid foods for outpatient management of malnutrition. These may be used as part of a community based food and nutrition program. \n\nThe improved availability of antibiotics to treat pneumonia, particularly in remote areas and among deprived populations, has contributed to reducing the child mortality rate by 6 per cent.\n\nOther curative interventions which can help to reduce child mortality include antibiotics to treat sepsis (6 per cent), the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria (5 per cent) and antibiotics to treat dysentery (2 per cent).\n\nThese interventions are highly beneficial to child health and development. However, coverage rates remain low due to underdevelopment and poverty, poor health care systems with limited access to health services (less than 40 per cent in most African countries), a lack of qualified human resources resulting in part from the brain drain to Western and Arab countries, inadequate equipment, an inconsistent supply of medications and basic products with frequent shortages, a poorly structured and barely functioning programme of health promotion, and limited budgets for health (less than the 15 per cent recommended by WHO for most African countries) combined with often unorthodox financial governance.\n\nThe strategies outlined below are recommended by WHO and adopted by all African countries as part of a bolder approach to serious child health problems. Their strengths reside in the complementarity of components integrated into strategies, the effectiveness in reducing child mortality and morbidity, and the positive long-term impact generated for children, such as enhanced school performance, well-being and life chances. These strategies offer an immediate return while having a significant impact on the future.\n\nIMCI is a strategy that integrates various programmes for the survival of children under 5 with a view to improving the practices that are likely to have the greatest impact on their health, growth and development. This is the overarching strategy for achieving MDG 4 (reduction of child mortality), and it is recommended by WHO and UNICEF, particularly in countries with a high child mortality rate. The strategy is simple and, according to the World Bank, cost-effective. It aims to address the main causes of child mortality in settings characterized by (1) a low level of health coverage, with little or no access to diagnostic equipment and treatment, (2) a low level of health monitoring, and (3) weak links between healthcare facilities and communities. IMCI has three components: (1) improving the skills of health care workers, (2) strengthening the health care system, and (3) improving family and community practices.\n\nMaternal and neonatal mortality in the Africa region accounts for more than half (51 per cent) of the world’s total maternal deaths, with a neonatal mortality rate of approximately 40 per thousand. The causes of these deaths could be prevented or avoided by the proper implementation of strategies for skilled care at birth and emergency obstetric and neonatal care services. With the assistance of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and the World Bank, various African countries have developed roadmaps for accelerating the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality by improving the skills of service providers, standardizing treatment protocols, and developing quality criteria for EmONC.\n\nWhile effective interventions and strategies for improving the health and nutrition status of young children are available, the financial resources required to implement them in Africa are inadequate. It is essential that African governments, their domestic partners (the private sector and civil society) and their partners abroad (bilateral and multilateral cooperation) invest more heavily in mobilizing resources for early childhood development. The focus should be on optimal governance of financial resources with transparent management rules and particular emphasis on equity of care and guaranteed access for the poor.\n\n"}

He conceived the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt which has become, at 54 tons, the world's largest piece of community folk art as of 2016. In 1983, at the onset of the AIDS pandemic Jones co-founded the San Francisco AIDS Foundation which has grown into one of the largest and most influential People with AIDS advocacy organizations in the United States.\n\nJones was born in West Lafayette, Indiana. He moved with his family to Scottsdale, Arizona, when he was 14, and was a student at Arizona State University for a time. Jones claimed, however, he never really accepted the Phoenix area as his home. His father was a psychologist. His mother was a Quaker, a faith she held at least in part to benefit her son in the era of the draft for the Vietnam war. He did not reveal his sexual orientation to his parents until he was 18.\n\nHis career as an activist began in San Francisco during the turbulent 1970s when, as a newcomer to the city, he was befriended by pioneer gay-rights leader Harvey Milk. Jones worked as a student intern in Milk’s office while studying political science at San Francisco State University.\n\nIn 1978, Dan White assassinated Harvey Milk, recently elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, along with San Francisco’s Mayor George Moscone, and Jones was one of the first people to see Milk's body after the assassination. Jones went to work in the district office of State Assemblyman Art Agnos.\n\nIn 1983, when AIDS was still a new and largely underestimated threat, Jones co-founded the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. Jones conceived the idea of the AIDS Memorial Quilt at a candlelight memorial for Harvey Milk in 1985 and in 1987 created the first quilt panel in honor of his friend Marvin Feldman. The AIDS Memorial Quilt has grown to become the world’s largest community arts project, memorializing the lives of over 85,000 Americans killed by AIDS.\n\nJones ran for a position on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in the November 3, 1992 election.\n\nWhile in San Francisco, Jones took part in a documentary, \"Echoes of Yourself in the Mirror\", about the HIV/AIDS epidemic, speaking during World AIDS Day in 2005. In the documentary he talks about the idea behind the AIDS Memorial Quilt, as well as the activism of San Francisco citizens in the 1970s and '80s to help people affected by AIDS and to figure out what the disease was. The film also looks at the impact HIV/AIDS is having in communities of color, and the young.\n\nJones has been working with UNITE HERE, the hotel, restaurant, and garment workers' labor union on homophobia issues. He is a driving force behind the Sleep With The Right People campaign, which aims to convince LGBT tourists to stay only in hotels that respect the rights of their workers. Another part of Jones's work with UNITE HERE is making the labor movement more open to LGBT members.\n\nIn an interview in November 2016 with Terry Gross on NPR radio talk show Fresh Air, Jones described his status as HIV+, and said while he first learned of his status when tests for infection came out the 1980s, he was likely infected with the virus around the winter of 1978 or 1979, based on blood samples collected from him as part of a study he volunteered for.\n\nIn the same interview, Jones also talked about the time when he became seriously ill, and how he responded rapidly to the \"cocktail\" of drugs that fought the virus, in the earliest trials of it. He described his present health as good. The interview was based on Jones's book, \"When We Rise: My Life in the Movement\", and the television program \"When We Rise\", broadcast in February and March 2017 on ABC in the USA. A theme of the interview was that activism saved his life, as he was in the early drug trials, part of the group pushing the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) to stop doing double-blind trials as soon as it was clear that the cocktail of drugs saved lives.\n\nJones is portrayed by actor Emile Hirsch in \"Milk\", director Gus Van Sant's 2008 biopic of Harvey Milk.\n\nJones is prominently featured in \"And the Band Played On\", Randy Shilts's best-selling 1987 work of non-fiction about the AIDS epidemic in the United States. Jones was also featured in the 1995 documentary film \"The Castro\".\n\nJones was one of the Official Grand Marshals of the 2009 NYC LGBT Pride March, produced by Heritage of Pride joining Dustin Lance Black and Anne Kronenberg on June 28, 2009. In August 2009, Jones was an official Grand Marshal of the Vancouver Pride Parade.\n\nJones participated as an actor in the Los Angeles premiere of \"8\", a condensed theatrical re-enactment of the \"Perry v. Schwarzenegger\" trial's closure, on March 3, 2012.\n\nJones is portrayed by actors Austin P. McKenzie and Guy Pearce in the 2017 ABC television miniseries \"When We Rise\", directed by Gus Van Sant.\n\nJones had a cameo appearance playing himself in \"\" in 2016.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "598596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=598596", "title": "Daniel Berrigan", "text": "Daniel Berrigan\n\nDaniel Joseph Berrigan (May 9, 1921April 30, 2016) was an American Jesuit priest, anti-war activist, Christian pacifist, playwright, poet, and author.\n\nLike many others during the 1960s, Berrigan's active protest against the Vietnam War earned him both scorn and admiration, but it was his participation in the Catonsville Nine that made him famous. It also landed him on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \"most wanted list\" (the first-ever priest on the list), on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, and in prison. His own particular form of militancy and radical spirituality in the service of social and political justice was significant enough, at that time, to \"shape the tactics of resistance to the Vietnam War\" in the United States.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Berrigan remained one of the US's leading anti-war activists. In 1980, he founded the Plowshares Movement, an anti-nuclear protest group, that put him back into the national spotlight. He was also an award-winning and prolific author of some 50 books, a teacher, and a university educator. He, along with his activist brother Philip Berrigan, were nominated in 1998 for the Nobel Peace Prize by 1976 laureate Mairead Maguire.\n\nBerrigan was born in Virginia, Minnesota, the son of Frieda Berrigan (née Fromhart), who was of German descent, and Thomas Berrigan, a second-generation Irish Catholic and active trade union member. He was the fifth of six sons. His youngest brother was fellow peace activist Philip Berrigan.\n\nAt age 5, Berrigan's family moved to Syracuse, New York. In 1946, Berrigan earned a bachelor's degree from St. Andrew-on-Hudson, a Jesuit seminary in Hyde Park, New York. In 1952 he received a master's degree from Woodstock College in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nBerrigan was devoted to the Catholic Church throughout his youth. He joined the Jesuits directly out of high school in 1939 and was ordained to the priesthood on June 19, 1952.\n\nBerrigan taught at St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City from 1946 to 1949.\n\nIn 1954, Berrigan was assigned to teach French and theology at the Jesuit Brooklyn Preparatory School. In 1957 he was appointed professor of New Testament studies at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York. The same year, he won the Lamont Prize for his book of poems, \"Time Without Number\". He developed a reputation as a religious radical, working actively against poverty and on changing the relationship between priests and lay people. While at Le Moyne, he founded its International House.\n\nWhile on a sabbatical from Le Moyne in 1963, Berrigan traveled to Paris and met French Jesuits who criticized the social and political conditions in Indochina. Taking inspiration from this, he and his brother Philip founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship, a group which organized protests against the war in Vietnam.\n\nOn October 28, 1965, Berrigan, along with the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, founded an organization known as Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam (CALCAV). The organization, founded at the Church Center for the United Nations, was joined by the likes of Dr. Hans Morgenthau, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., and the Rev. Philip Berrigan, among many others. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who delivered his 1967 speech \"\" under sponsorship from CALCAV, served as the national co-chairman of the organization.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, Berrigan was the assistant director of the Cornell University United Religious Work (CURW), the umbrella organization for all religious groups on campus, including the Cornell Newman Club (later the Cornell Catholic Community), eventually becoming the group's pastor.\n\nBerrigan at one time or another held faculty positions or ran programs at Union Theological Seminary, Loyola University in New Orleans, Columbia, Cornell, and Yale. His longest tenure was at Fordham (a Jesuit university located in the Bronx), where for a brief time he also served as poet-in-residence.\n\nBerrigan appeared briefly in the 1986 Warner Brothers film \"The Mission\", playing a Jesuit priest. He also served as a consultant on the film.\n\nBerrigan, his brother and Josephite priest Philip Berrigan, and Trappist monk Thomas Merton founded an interfaith coalition against the Vietnam War and wrote letters to major newspapers arguing for an end to the war. In 1967, Berrigan witnessed the public outcry that followed from the arrest of his brother Philip, for pouring blood on draft records as part of the Baltimore Four. Philip was sentenced to six years in prison for defacing government property. The fallout he had to endure from these many interventions, including his support for prisoners of war and, in 1968, seeing firsthand the conditions on the ground in Vietnam, further radicalized Berrigan, or at least strengthened his determination to resist American military imperialism.\n\nBerrigan traveled to Hanoi with Howard Zinn during the Tet Offensive in January 1968 to \"receive\" three American airmen, the first American prisoners of war released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun.\n\nIn 1968, he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse to make tax payments in protest of the Vietnam War. In the same year, he was interviewed in the anti-Vietnam War documentary film \"In the Year of the Pig\", and later that year became involved in radical non-violent protest.\n\nDaniel Berrigan and his brother Philip, along with seven other Catholic protesters, used homemade napalm to destroy 378 draft files in the parking lot of the Catonsville, Maryland, draft board on May 17, 1968. This group, which came to be known as the Catonsville Nine, issued a statement after the incident:\n\nBerrigan was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison, but went into hiding with the help of fellow radicals prior to imprisonment. While on the run, Berrigan was interviewed for Lee Lockwood's documentary \"The Holy Outlaw\". The FBI apprehended him on August 11, 1970 at the home of William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne. Berrigan was then imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut until his release on February 24, 1972.\n\nIn retrospect, the trial of the Catonsville Nine was significant because it \"altered resistance to the Vietnam War, moving activists from street protests to repeated acts of civil disobedience, including the burning of draft cards.\" As \"The New York Times\" noted in its obituary, Berrigan's actions helped \"shape the tactics of opposition to the Vietnam War.\"\n\nOn September 9, 1980, Berrigan, his brother Philip, and six others (the \"Plowshares Eight\") began the Plowshares Movement. They trespassed onto the General Electric nuclear missile facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where they damaged nuclear warhead nose cones and poured blood onto documents and files. They were arrested and charged with over ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. On April 10, 1990, after ten years of appeals, Berrigan's group was re-sentenced and paroled for up to 23 and 1/2 months in consideration of time already served in prison. Their legal battle was re-created in Emile de Antonio's 1982 film \"In the King of Prussia,\" which starred Martin Sheen and featured appearances by the Plowshares Eight as themselves.\n\nBerrigan endorsed a consistent life ethic, a morality based on a holistic reverence for life. As a member of the Rochester, New York-area consistent life ethic advocacy group \"Faith and Resistance Community\", he protested via civil disobedience against abortion at a new Planned Parenthood clinic in 1991.\n\nBerrigan said of pastoral care to AIDS patients:\nBerrigan published \"Sorrow Built a Bridge: Friendship and AIDS\" reflecting on his experiences ministering to AIDS patients through the Supportive Care Program at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in 1989. The \"Religious Studies Review\" wrote, \"the strength of this volume lies in its capacity to portray sensitively the impact of AIDS on human lives.\" Speaking about AIDS patients, many of whom were gay, \"The Charlotte Observer\" quoted Berrigan saying in 1991, \"Both the church and the state are finding ways to kill people with AIDS, and one of the ways is ostracism that pushes people between the cracks of respectability or acceptability and leaves them there to make of life what they will or what they cannot.\"\n\nAlthough much of his later work was devoted to assisting AIDS patients in New York City, Berrigan still held to his activist roots throughout his life. He maintained his opposition to American interventions abroad, from Central America in the 1980s, through the Gulf War in 1991, the Kosovo War, the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was also an opponent of capital punishment, a contributing editor of \"Sojourners\", and a supporter of the Occupy movement.\n\nBerrigan has been considered by many to be a Christian anarchist.\n\n\nOn 30 April 2016, forty-one years after the conclusion of the Vietnam War, Berrigan died in The Bronx, New York City, at Murray-Weigel Hall, the Jesuit infirmary at Fordham University. For many years, since 1975, he had lived on the Upper West Side at the West Side Jesuit Community. He died as he lived, in faith and freedom.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38468174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38468174", "title": "Edward Clark (conductor)", "text": "Edward Clark (conductor)\n\nThomas Edward Clark (10 May 188830 April 1962) was an English conductor and music producer for the BBC. Through his positions in leading new music organizations and his wide-ranging contacts with British and European composers, he had a major impact on making contemporary classical music available to the British public for over 30 years. He was a leading figure in the BBC's Concerts of Contemporary Music between 1926 and 1939, and he played a significant role in the founding and early development of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held prominent positions in the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) from its inception in 1922, and was its President from 1947 to 1955.\n\nHe was responsible for producing a number of important world and British premieres (some of which he also conducted), and he was associated with most of the important European and British composers, such as Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, Ferruccio Busoni, Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, William Walton, Arthur Bliss, Arnold Bax, Peter Warlock, John Ireland, Constant Lambert, Arthur Benjamin, Humphrey Searle, Denis ApIvor, Alan Rawsthorne, Benjamin Britten, Michael Tippett, Benjamin Frankel, Roberto Gerhard, Luigi Dallapiccola, Christian Darnton and others.\n\nEdward Clark was described by some as Mephistophelean. He was outspoken, immensely erudite, and a visionary. But he was also a loose cannon when it came to administrative matters, tending to ruffle feathers with his too-individual approach, brooking no interference, and being distrustful of those who did not share his vision but often inadequately communicating that vision to them. In 1936 these matters contributed in large part to his premature departure from the BBC, and from the inner sanctum of the contemporary music scene, which he had helped to create as much as anyone, and more than most. His personal integrity in regard to the use of official funds also came under question more than once, in one instance leading to a public scandal and court case in which he sued Benjamin Frankel for slander.\n\nClark's ex-wife Dorothy Eckersley was jailed in 1945 for making anti-British broadcasts over a German radio station during World War II; their teenage son James Clark was also involved in this. His second wife was the composer Elisabeth Lutyens, with whom he had another child.\n\nThomas Edward Clark was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 10 May 1888. His father, James Bowness Clark (1863–1934), was a coal exporter and amateur musician who supported his son's musical interests and for two decades was the secretary of the Newcastle and Gateshead Choral Union. He and his wife Elizabeth née Thirlaway (1858–1939) had three children.\n\nEdward Clark was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle. Studying in Paris in 1907 and 1908, he met Claude Debussy, Albert Roussel and Maurice Ravel. He returned to Newcastle and presented a paper called \"Paper on a Modern French Composer: Claude Debussy\"; at that time he formulated a strong desire to encourage British audiences \"to understand this music of to-day before it becomes the music of the day before yesterday\". In 1909 he studied conducting with Oskar Fried in Berlin while employed as the Berlin correspondent for \"The Musical Times\".\n\nClark's first exposure to the music of Arnold Schoenberg was at a performance of his symphonic poem \"Pelleas und Melisande\" on 31 October 1910 at a concert by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Berlin. He was profoundly impressed by this music, and he was introduced to Schoenberg and Anton Webern after the concert. He became Schoenberg's champion and, along with people like Artur Schnabel, Ferruccio Busoni, Oskar Fried and others, he convinced him to move from Vienna to Berlin, because of the greater opportunities and contacts there. From 1910 until 1912 Clark studied with Schoenberg in Berlin, the only British student he ever had. At first Clark was his sole pupil, then he was joined by Eduard Steuermann, and others later. Clark arranged for Schoenberg to give a series of ten public lectures at the Stern Conservatory (\"10 Lectures on the Aesthetics of Music and the Rules of Composition\"), which he also attended. He helped raise funds for Schoenberg, and played a part in having his \"Five Pieces for Orchestra\" published in a cheap edition, which sold out quickly. One of the purchasers was Sir Henry Wood.\n\nOn 3 September 1912, Wood conducted the world premiere of the \"Five Pieces for Orchestra\" at a Promenade Concert at the Queen's Hall in London. At Wood's suggestion, Clark invited Schoenberg to make his British conducting debut, and on 17 January 1914 he conducted the same work at the same venue.\n\nClark attended the Leipzig premiere of \"Gurre-Lieder\" in January 1914 along with Schoenberg, Webern and others. He had been considering settling permanently in Germany, and the matter was decided when he was offered a professional post in Stettin. In early August 1914 he was attending the Bayreuth Festival, on his way to take up that appointment, when World War I broke out. He was arrested at Bayreuth as an enemy alien, and interned at Ruhleben internment camp near Berlin; Edgar Bainton, his colleague from Newcastle, was also interned at that time, as were Ernest MacMillan, Arthur Benjamin and others. Clark was released in May 1918 through the offices of the Red Cross.\n\nOn his return to London, he became assistant conductor to Ernest Ansermet and Adrian Boult for Sergei Diaghilev's seasons of the Ballets Russes, and he became friendly with Diaghilev and Igor Stravinsky. In the winter and spring of 1921 he presented two series of concerts of new music, which proved very popular but made him little money. On 8 April at the Queen's Hall he presented the UK premiere of Stravinsky's 1919 Suite from \"The Firebird\", and two world premieres: Arnold Bax's \"The Bard of the Dimbovitza\", song cycle with orchestra, with Ethel Fenton (mezzo-soprano) and the \"Storm Music\" from Arthur Bliss's incidental music for \"The Tempest\".\n\nOn 20 April 1921 Arthur Bliss's \"Conversations\" for string quartet had its world premiere at a Clark concert. On 6 May 1921 he presented Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9, to British audiences for the first time, at the Aeolian Hall. The players were Charles Woodhouse (violin), John Barbirolli (cello), Léon Goossens (oboe), and Aubrey Brain and Alfred Brain (horns). This was part of a series of four concerts of recent works by French, German and English composers, many of them first English performances. On 20 May 1921 he conducted the British premiere of Manuel de Falla's \"Nights in the Gardens of Spain\", with the composer at the piano.\n\nClark attended the inaugural session of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) in Salzburg in 1922, and remained a significant figure in the organisation for the rest of his life.\n\nIn August 1921 he married Dorothy (\"Dolly\") Stephen, and their son James Royston Clark was born in 1923.\n\nClark was hired by the BBC in August 1924 as Musical Director for their Newcastle station. His imagination, creativity and innovative approaches to programming were soon noted, attracting praise from local Newcastle musical circles; but so too were his administrative shortcomings. In December 1924, in Newcastle, Clark conducted the world premiere of the orchestral version of Arnold Schoenberg's \"Verklärte Nacht\". The Newcastle station orchestra was disbanded at the end of 1926, and Clark transferred to London in January 1927 as a programme planner, at the request of Percy Pitt.\n\nAlthough he was employed full-time by the BBC for only another seven years, it was primarily through his influence that the BBC became established as an international patron of new music. He also did a considerable amount of conducting during this period, sometimes of the works he was producing for the BBC, and sometimes on a free-lance basis.\n\nOn 19 June 1927 he conducted the British premiere of Igor Stravinsky's Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, with the composer (in his British radio debut) and the Wireless Symphony Orchestra. On 10–12 July 1927 he conducted three fully staged performances of \"L'Histoire du soldat\" at the Arts Theatre Club; they were sung in English and the third performance was broadcast. Clark had also performed this work in its British premiere in the autumn of 1926 in Newcastle.\n\nIn November of that year he was able to secure Oskar Fried his first British conducting engagement (the programme included Weber, Brahms and Liszt). Clark invited Schoenberg to London to conduct the first British performance of his \"Gurre-Lieder\" on 27 January 1928, and assisted with the rehearsals. (He had tried to have the premiere the previous year, on 14 April 1927, but these plans fell through.)\n\nIn April 1929, Edward Clark along with Julian Herbage of the BBC's Music Department devised a plan for a 114-piece orchestra that was especially suited to broadcasting, and one that could be split into four different smaller groups as required. This was the original workable concept for the BBC Symphony Orchestra after some earlier ideas from Sir Thomas Beecham foundered. Beecham was the first choice for chief conductor, but he withdrew and Adrian Boult directed the orchestra for the next 20 years. Boult did not always support Clark's choices of repertoire, however. He refused to play the music of Alexander Scriabin that Clark programmed, calling it \"evil music\", and even issued a ban on Scriabin's music from broadcasts in the 1930s. It is also true that he had no personal sympathy with the music of the Second Viennese School, describing Alban Berg's \"Lyric Suite\" as \"a Kensington drawing room apology for what Berg really meant\", but Clark's influence was such that he was at least prepared to participate in performances of this music.\n\nIt was Clark who suggested to William Walton that he invite Paul Hindemith to be the soloist at the premiere of his Viola Concerto in 1929, when the dedicatee Lionel Tertis declined. Tertis also claimed to have suggested Hindemith in his place, but Walton confirmed it was Clark's idea. Walton was initially somewhat reluctant to invite Hindemith, as he felt he had modelled the concerto too closely after the latter's style, which he would quickly recognise; but thanks to Edward Clark, the invitation was sent and accepted, the premiere took place on 3 October, and the two composers became lifelong friends (they had met briefly in 1923).\n\nClark played an even greater role in Walton's \"Belshazzar's Feast\": he was its progenitor. On 21 August 1929 he asked Walton for a work suitable for broadcasting, written for a small choir, soloist, and an orchestra not exceeding 15 players. Walton later thanked Clark for bringing \"Belshazzar's Feast\" to the attention of Sergei Prokofiev, who showed some interest in it.\n\nHis friend John Ireland introduced Alan Bush to Clark, who was responsible for having many of Bush's works broadcast between 1929 and 1936.\n\nOn 3 March 1930, Edward Clark played a major part in the first complete broadcast (18 poems) of Walton's \"Façade\", at the Central Hall, Westminster, with Edith Sitwell and Constant Lambert (speakers), Leslie Heward conducting.\n\nOn 9 January 1931, Schoenberg conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the British premiere of \"Erwartung\". Clark was able to use the prestige and contacts he had by now built up to secure the ISCM Festival for London and Oxford in July 1931.\n\nAs well as Schoenberg, Clark invited Anton Webern and Alban Berg to visit England several times to conduct their own works. Berg was very reluctant, insisting he was no conductor. Clark nevertheless made sure his major works received performances in England: the \"Lyric Suite\" and Chamber Concerto (21 April 1933); the \"Wozzeck\" fragments (13 May 1932), and complete in concert performance (14 March 1934); \"Der Wein\"; the Symphonic Pieces from \"Lulu\" (20 March 1935; this was the first time Berg had ever heard this music (by radio broadcast); he was not to hear a live performance of it until 11 December in Vienna, a fortnight before his death); and, posthumously, the Violin Concerto.\n\nBetween November 1932 and January 1933, while staying in Barcelona, Schoenberg wrote a transcription for cello and orchestra of the Keyboard Concerto in D by Georg Matthias Monn. He wrote it for Pablo Casals, to whom he offered the first performance, but Casals declined. It received its first public airing on 3 February (or 5 February) 1933 in an afternoon studio broadcast from London by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Edward Clark, with the soloist Antoni Sala. There was no announcement of this world premiere and there is no extant documentation of the broadcast. Schoenberg was probably in attendance; he was in London to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra's world premiere (broadcast) performance of the Variations, Op. 31.\n\nOn 1 March 1933, just four weeks after Adolf Hitler had become German Chancellor, Schoenberg resigned from his teaching post in the face of imminent dismissal for being part of what Hitler had described as \"the Jewish stranglehold on Western music\". He moved to Paris on 16 May, intending to remain there, but he had no luck in securing a French publisher or any conducting opportunities. He wrote to Edward Clark by postcard later that month, asking him to use his contacts to get him some performances of the Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra, and a British publisher for that work and the Cello Concerto. He was also seeking to have his Jewish drama, written 1925–26, be published by a British Jewish publisher. Clark approached a number of people on Schoenberg's behalf, but received only knockbacks. He did, however, arrange for two concerts in November, in which \"Pierrot Lunaire\" and the Suite, Op. 29 would receive performances. But it was not to be. Schoenberg received an offer of a teaching post at a Boston music academy, and decided to quit Europe, sailing for the United States on 25 October 1933.\n\nClark was in Moscow in January 1934, where he conducted John Ireland's Piano Concerto in E-flat major. On 8 February 1935 he conducted the first British broadcast of Kurt Weill's \"Die Dreigroschenoper\". It received scathing reviews from Ernest Newman and other critics. But the most savage criticism came from Weill himself, who described it privately as \"the worst performance imaginable ... the whole thing was completely misunderstood\". But his criticisms seem to have been for the concept of the piece as a Germanised version of \"The Beggar's Opera\", rather than for Clark's conducting of it, of which Weill made no mention.\n\nAlso in 1935 he chose Harriet Cohen to perform new Soviet music by Dmitri Shostakovich, Dmitry Kabalevsky, and Georgy Kh. Mepurnov in London. The same year he was instrumental in arranging a series of BBC broadcasts, in which the emigré German composer and musicologist Ernst Hermann Meyer was engaged to present important revivals of 17th century consort music.\n\nClark was responsible for bringing Béla Bartók to Britain to perform his works at the Proms, such as the Piano Concerto No. 2 on 7 January 1936 under Sir Henry Wood. Through Clark's endeavours the world premiere concert performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, took place in Vienna in 1936 under the BBC Symphony Orchestra.\n\nEdward Clark may have suggested Benjamin Britten's name to Alberto Cavalcanti of the GPO Film Unit as a young composer he should consider for film scores. This led to Britten's score for \"Night Mail\" (1936). Clark had planned to have the world premiere of Britten's \"Cantique d'amour\" presented by the BBC in 1936, but perceptions about Britten's personal morality led to the plan being shelved, to Clark's chagrin.\n\nUnder the direction of Edward Clark and Constant Lambert, some of Bernard van Dieren's larger works were performed by the BBC in the composer's last years, and just after his death in 1936.\n\nOn 19 January 1936, Hindemith travelled to London, intending to play the British premiere of his viola concerto \"Der Schwanendreher\", with Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Queen's Hall on 22 January. However, just before midnight on 20 January, King George V died. The concert was cancelled, but Boult and Clark still wanted Hindemith's involvement in any music that was broadcast in its place. They debated for hours what might be a suitable piece, but nothing could be found, so it was decided that Hindemith should write something new. The following day, from 11 am to 5 pm, Hindemith sat in an office made available to him by the BBC and wrote \"Trauermusik\" in homage to the late king. It, too, was written for viola and orchestra. It was performed that evening in a live broadcast from a BBC radio studio, with Boult conducting and the composer as soloist.\n\nClark resigned angrily and abruptly from the BBC on 16 March 1936. The immediate cause of this protest was some alterations to the concert programmes for the BBC Symphony Orchestra's forthcoming European tour, in which he had invested much time and great care. These changes were made without his knowledge and while he was on sick leave, and they included the complete removal of Béla Bartók's \"Four Orchestral Pieces\" from the Budapest programme.\n\nHowever, this parting of the ways suited many people in the BBC, as it came in the wake of very strong criticism that had been building over a long time about Clark's poor work habits, his general inefficiency, his unpunctuality and missing of important deadlines, his administrative bungling and his unwillingness to communicate with his colleagues about what he was doing, thinking or planning. His dismissal had been considered more than once. His conducting was also the subject of criticism, on the basis that he could not quickly establish rapport with or give strong and unambiguous directions to his players, and he was discouraged from this activity. His personal integrity had also come under question: He took sick leave in 1928 due to severe rheumatism that necessitated having his affected arm in a sling, but while on leave he conducted orchestras in both London and Prague. Then there was a trip to Europe to negotiate with Arturo Toscanini about his involvement in the forthcoming BBC Symphony Orchestra's appearances at the Florence May Festival; Clark changed his travel arrangements at the last minute, he stayed a week longer than he was scheduled to, he still did not complete the task he was sent to do, and the rocky relationship Toscanini already had with the BBC was further soured. Adrian Boult backed Clark to the hilt, saying he had done a very good job in very difficult circumstances; but it was too late.\n\nClark never worked in a steady job again, although he was a consultant to the BBC on certain projects, and continued to conduct on a free-lance basis for a few years until the work dried up.\n\nEdward Clark's departure had the effect of relegating Schoenberg, Webern, Berg and other members of the Second Viennese School to fringe composers as far as British audiences were concerned, and they were not brought back into the mainstream until William Glock's appointment in 1959. The BBC Symphony Orchestra's repertoire was similarly affected; it became more focused on the works of Romantic and post-Romantic composers for the next 25 years, leaving contemporary music to struggle for limited hearings. \"Tonality had returned to the airwaves\", to the relief of many.\n\nBut Clark himself remained busy with the ISCM and other activities. On 19 April 1936 he was at the ISCM Festival in Barcelona for the world premiere of Berg's Violin Concerto, played by Louis Krasner. He arranged for Krasner to come to Britain for the local premiere; in the event, it was a private studio performance on 1 May, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Anton Webern, who had gone to Barcelona to conduct the world premiere but withdrew at the last minute, fortunately proved up to the task on this occasion.\n\nClark's influence was not confined to Britain and Europe. The Australian pianist and composer Roy Agnew heard some of Clark's broadcasts while he was in Britain in the 1920s. He was part of the network of like-minded people who spread the word about emerging compositions throughout the English-speaking world. Between 1937 and 1942 Agnew broadcast his own radio programme, \"Modern and Contemporary Music\", for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This was no doubt strongly influenced by Clark's programmes.\n\nClark produced concert versions of Ferruccio Busoni's \"Doktor Faust\" (1937) and \"Arlecchino\" (1939), many years before the British stage premiere of either work.\n\nIn 1938 Edward Clark met the composer Elisabeth Lutyens. In quick succession they became lovers, she left her husband Ian Glennie, she and Clark had a child (her fourth), and they married in 1942. They spent the war years in Newcastle, where he founded the North East Regional Orchestra (NERO).\n\nLutyens was equally well connected with the musical establishment, and was also a friend of Igor Stravinsky. Clark's influence may have been a decisive factor in her adopting serial techniques. It is certainly the case that her first truly serial composition, the Chamber Concerto No. 1, was completed in 1939, the year after she and Clark became partners, and she dedicated it to him.\n\nBut because he was mostly unemployed now, this meant that Lutyens was the main bread winner for the family of six, and she took on certain commissions she might otherwise have declined. These included her film scores, which have received latter-day recognition as among her finest creations. She was also prepared to scrub floors to help make ends meet; but Clark would consider nothing but conducting, even though all offers dried up early. He was essentially unemployed for the last 23 years of his life. Lutyens said that she hated writing her 1972 autobiography \"A Goldfish Bowl\", and only did so to record Clark's earlier achievements.\n\nIn 1945, William Walton was able to repay Clark's good work from the Viola Concerto premiere in 1929. Elisabeth Lutyens approached Walton for an introduction to Muir Mathieson with a view to getting some film music work. He readily agreed to pass on her name, but he went a step further. He invited Lutyens to write any work she liked, dedicate it to him and he would pay her £100 sight unseen. The work she wrote was \"The Pit\". Clark conducted \"The Pit\" at the 1946 ISCM Festival in London, along with her \"Three Symphonic Preludes\".\n\nIf not a communist, Clark was always a dedicated socialist, and he was a member of the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR (now the Society for Co-operation in Russian and Soviet Studies, SCRSS). It was in this capacity that in March 1940 he approached firstly Clifford Curzon, who declined, and then Moura Lympany, who agreed, to be the soloist at the UK premiere of Aram Khachaturian's Piano Concerto in D-flat. The work was still in manuscript, and there was only one month in which to learn it. The concert was at the Queen's Hall on 13 April 1940, and the orchestra was conducted by Clark's friend and committed communist Alan Bush.\n\nIn 1945–46 he presented three concerts at the Wigmore Hall in London, of music by British and European composers. He organised the 1946 London ISCM Festival, a year before being elected the organisation's third President. He been active with the ISCM since its inception in 1922, as Chairman of the British Chapter. He was also associated with the London Contemporary Music Centre 1947–52 (where the Australian composer Don Banks was his secretary), and music adviser to the Institute for Contemporary Arts from its inception in 1948. Humphrey Searle became the ISCM's General Secretary with Clark's support.\n\nIn 1946 Clark attended the first performance of Denis ApIvor's \"Lorca songs\" at a concert for the Society for the Promotion of New Music. He was impressed, and included these songs in a London Contemporary Music concert at the Wigmore Hall in 1947. Later that same year, Clark produced ApIvor's Violin Sonata, Op. 9 played by Antonio Brosa and Kyla Greenbaum. It was through Clark that ApIvor became interested in serialism.\n\nHis administrative skills never improved. In 1947, Peggy Glanville-Hicks, President of the United States branch of the ISCM, was forced to write sharply to him to protest about unanswered correspondence in which the Americans had asked that the ISCM Festival scheduled for June 1948 in Amsterdam be held as late as possible in the month, in order to allow them the chance to attend, given their existing university teaching commitments. In the event, the US branch withdrew from the festival, but Glanville-Hicks attended in her personal capacity.\n\nIn 1948, for the BBC's Third Programme, Clark presented \"Turning Points in Twentieth-Century Music\", a series of eight programmes of his own creation, which looked at the composers Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Bartók.\n\nHe gave the Commemoration Speech before the London Opera Guild's 'Arnold Schoenberg Memorial Concert' on 16 December 1951.\n\nIn 1953 Sir William Walton used his contacts to secure a Civil List pension for Clark.\n\nIn 1955, Benjamin Frankel succeeded Clark as Chairman of the ISCM. That year issues arose about certain expenses Clark had claimed while he was Chairman. Clark alleged that Frankel had falsely accused him of fraud. Frankel denied he had ever made any such claim, but nevertheless said that such a claim, had he made it, would have been true. This amounted to slander as far as Clark was concerned, and he sued Frankel in the High Court. As part of the arguments, various allegations of communist sub-plots were given an airing. While Frankel's alleged slander itself was unproven, the jury exonerated Clark of any wrongdoing and he felt this meant his integrity was intact. Elisabeth Lutyens ever after referred to Frankel as \"composer and ex-colleague\".\n\nIn 1960 and 1961 he used his influence to have Denis ApIvor's opera \"Yerma\" broadcast by the BBC after the Sadler's Wells Theatre refused to mount the production (even though it had been commissioned by the Sadler's Wells Trust). It was conducted by Sir Eugene Goossens.\n\nEdward Clark died suddenly of a coronary thrombosis in London on 30 April 1962, aged 73. Stravinsky wept on hearing of Clark's death.\n\nIn 1951 the Internationale Gesellschaft für Neue Musik (IGNM) awarded Edward Clark the Arnold Schoenberg Medal.\n\nClark is one of a select band of Honorary Members of the ISCM.\n\n\nOn 10 August 1921 he married Frances Dorothy (\"Dolly\") Stephen (18 December 1893 – 1971), who was related to the literary Stephen family (including Sir Leslie Stephen and his daughter Virginia Woolf). Clark's and Dolly's son James Royston Clark was born in 1923. Dolly left him in the summer of 1925, taking James with her.\n\nDolly later went to work for the BBC as a secretary, and had an affair with Clark's colleague, the engineer Peter Eckersley. This seemed to have Clark's blessing, as on one occasion he even arranged for Eckersley to visit Germany on BBC business, and for Dolly to accompany him. Eckersley was married, but although he and Dolly made no secret of their liaison, his wife Stella was unaware. It was Muriel Reith, the wife of the BBC Director-General John Reith, who broke the news to her. John Reith was strictly puritanical about such matters (although his own private life was questionable), and he was most unwilling to have a senior staff member on the payroll who was known to be conducting an adulterous affair or in the process of divorcing his own wife. Top level conferences were held; the Archbishop of Canterbury was even consulted. However, Eckersley was not sacked immediately, as he undertook to end the affair with Dolly Clark and return to his wife. But nature took its course, he and Dolly reunited, and he resigned in April 1929. The Eckersley affair prompted a public enquiry into the BBC's personnel practices.\n\nDolly Clark and Peter Eckersley were married on 25 October 1930.\n\nShe had always been very much pro-Nazi in her politics. She was known as a strongly pro-German fascist and a fanatical admirer of Adolf Hitler. She was a friend of William Joyce (\"Lord Haw-Haw\") and Unity Mitford, and a member of Arnold Leese's Imperial Fascist League. Peter Eckersley himself held similar opinions. After they met Sir Oswald Mosley, he became involved in his New Party, chairing its London Central Committee. He travelled throughout Europe constantly in a quest to expand the reach of international radio broadcasts; he claimed there were no sinister political motives behind his activities, but that they were simply his attempt to make himself very rich. From November 1939 the transmitter he had arranged to put in place at Osterloog became the vehicle for William Joyce's broadcasts to Britain and Europe. Joyce was later hanged for treason, and Eckersley has been described as \"at best a foolish Fascist fellow traveller and at worst a traitor\". As for Dolly, she joined Mosley's British Union of Fascists, but outdid Mosley in her enthusiasm for the Nazi concept of fascism. She also joined the National Socialist League, which had been founded by William Joyce after he was expelled by Mosley for being too anti-semitic.\n\nThe Eckersleys took their holidays in Germany a number of times, and attended the Nuremberg rallies in 1937 and 1938. In July 1939 Dorothy took her and Edward Clark's 16-year-old son James to a Nuremberg rally, and also attended the Salzburg Festival. She had a chance encounter with William Joyce in August and got him a job as a radio announcer and scriptwriter. When Britain declared war in September, she felt no need to return to her own country but decided to stay. James was enrolled in a German school, and gained \"a very favourable impression of Germany under Nazi rule\". In December 1939 she commenced work for the radio station Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (RRG), a propaganda machine for Joseph Goebbels. She was initially employed as an English-language announcer and later on office duties. James, although only aged 16, was taken out of school to also be a newsreader there. He changed his name to Richard, to sound less Jewish and more Wagnerian. He worked there on and off until July 1942; she continued until January 1943. For obscure reasons they were arrested by the Gestapo in December 1944 and incarcerated till the end of the war. They were liberated by the British, but promptly re-arrested. They were both tried in London in October 1945 for assisting the enemy by broadcasting. Dorothy was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison. James, still only 22, pleaded he had been hypnotised as an impressionable youth by the trappings and tricks of Nazi propaganda; this was accepted, and he was bound over for two years.\n\nDorothy Eckersley died in 1971. James Clark became an editor and translator and died in 2012.\n\nIn 1938 Edward Clark met the composer Elisabeth Lutyens, who was married to the baritone Ian Glennie. She and Clark quickly became lovers, and later that year she left Glennie for Clark, taking her and Glennie's three children (a son and twin daughters) with her. In 1941 Clark gave her a fourth child (a son, Conrad) before marrying her on 9 May 1942.\n\nTheir son Conrad Clark became a sculptor, designer and painter; he moved to Australia and now lives in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23197929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23197929", "title": "Frank Newsam", "text": "Frank Newsam\n\nSir Frank Aubrey Newsam, (13 November 1893 – 25 April 1964) was a British civil servant notable for his service as Permanent Under-Secretary of State to the Home Office from 1948 to 1957, although he had been a central figure for many years previously. His strong leadership abilities had a dominating effect on the character of his department, in which he served for all but a few months of his career. His principal interest during this time was the Police service, for which he created the Police Staff College at Bramshill. At his best in a crisis, his contribution to the recovery after the North Sea flood of 1953 was particularly praised.\n\nA man of great energy and drive, Newsam's tendency to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant that he was not automatically popular with the Home Secretaries under whom he worked. However, his negotiating ability was superb, and he allowed himself time to enjoy the finer things in life. His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.\n\nNewsam was born in Barbados, where his father William Elias Newsam held a post in the British Colonial Service. He went to school at Harrison College in Barbados, and then won an open scholarship in classics to St John's College, Oxford in 1911. Newsam graduated in 1915 with second classes in each of Mods and Greats, his failure to take a first being later ascribed to his desire to enjoy life while at university. Newsam (who had been a member of the Inns of Court Officer Training Corps) was then commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment. He saw active service in Ireland and was wounded during the Easter Rising in 1916; during the First World War he served in Belgium, France, the Punjab and Afghanistan. In September 1918, while a Lieutenant, he was awarded the Military Cross; the citation referred to him going \"forward collecting all stragglers and reorganising the line when one of the companies commenced to retire\", so restoring the offensive capability of his unit.\n\nLate in the war, Newsam served with the first battalion of the 30th Punjabis in India (in October 1919 he was promoted to the rank of Captain in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers). He served again in Ireland after the armistice, but after demobilisation in 1919 he joined the teaching staff at Harrow School under Dr Lionel Ford. Newsam was at Harrow for only a brief period while waiting for the result of the Class I Competition for the Home Civil Service. In July 1920 he was informed that he had passed, and he then joined the Children's Division of the Home Office.\n\nNewsam made his mark in the division, and in 1924 was picked by the then Permanent Secretary Sir John Anderson, as Anderson's own private secretary. Having come to trust Newsam's abilities, Anderson retained him in this post despite Newsam's promotion to principal in 1925. There were some who saw him as a \"power behind the throne\" in assisting Anderson. In 1927, Anderson placed Newsam in an even more pivotal post as Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs (Home Secretary) – responsible for administering the office of the political head of the department. Newsam held this key position for over five years, assisting Home Secretaries William Joynson-Hicks ('Jix'), J. R. Clynes, Sir Herbert Samuel, and Sir John Gilmour. Especially after Anderson left in 1932 (his successor Sir Russell Scott came from the Treasury with little knowledge of the operation of the Home Office), no other civil servant rivalled his experience. For his part, Newsam learned a great deal about the operations of senior politicians and of Parliament.\n\nA round of changes in civil service appointments at the Home Office in June 1933 saw Newsam, now promoted to Assistant Secretary, take charge of a new division. His first responsibility was to guide into law the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934, but he soon began to handle other sensitive matters. He was also appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1933 Queen's Birthday Honours. Newsam sat on a departmental committee of inquiry into Firearms in 1934, and this was followed by the problem of addressing the disorder caused by fighting between members of the British Union of Fascists and its opponents. Newsam played a large role in devising and then implementing the Public Order Act 1936, which banned all political uniforms and was seen as effective in returning order to the streets.\n\n1938 saw Newsam moved to take charge of the criminal division, where he began preparations for a major Criminal Justice Bill; however the advancing threat of war led to it being put off (in the event, most of the provisions were enacted in the Criminal Justice Act 1948). Late in 1938, Newsam was selected as Principal Officer in the South Eastern Civil Defence region; this role meant that should war break out, he would be Chief of Staff to the Regional Commissioner. He duly took up his post in September 1939 but after only a few months in Tunbridge Wells, he was recalled to London to take charge of the criminal and aliens divisions, now with the rank of Assistant Under-Secretary of State.\n\nIn April 1941 Newsam's appointment to Deputy Under-Secretary of State was announced. He was now the second most senior civil servant in the Home Office and had a special responsibility for security. Newsam negotiated with the United States how to handle criminal offences committed by American soldiers in the United Kingdom, the agreement being enacted in the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942. With the Home Office responsible for relations with the Crown Dependencies, Newsam drew up plans for the restoration of life in the Channel Islands once German occupation was ended. Newsam's plans were subsequently put into effect in 1945, and led to a long association with the islands where he helped reform constitutions and develop their legal and administrative systems.\n\nHaving been in charge of internment of enemy aliens and suspected fascist sympathisers under Defence Regulation 18B, Newsam had in 1944 to consider the vexed question of what to do with the 'Red Book' containing the membership list from Archibald Maule Ramsay's 'Right Club', after Ramsay was released from detention. After discussing the question with a colleague, the idea came up that it may be necessary to illegally destroy the book and then take the chance that Ramsay would get only token damages out of any legal action that might ensue. In the end, the book was returned to Ramsay. Newsam became Sir Frank in 1943 when he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours.\n\nIt was towards the end of the war that Newsam's particular interest in the police force began to take shape. His first task was to reform the large number of very small police forces, as many municipal boroughs that were not especially large had a separate constabulary. Wartime powers had forced some to amalgamate, but Newsam needed to go further. Conscious that a Whitehall takeover was feared, in May 1945 he spoke to the conference of the Chief Constables' Association to reassure them that there would be no regional or national police forces. He eventually drafted the Police Act 1946 which abolished nearly all the borough police forces outside County boroughs, and allowed for more amalgamations. Once the Act was passed, Newsam again reassured the police that there was no question of regionalisation or nationalisation because \"such an idea is an anathema to the Home Office\".\n\nMeanwhile, Newsam also looked into the whole policing service from 1944, and became personally committed to the idea of establishing a national staff college for the police. He saw that the project found the land needed for its buildings (at Bramshill, near Hartley Wintney in Hampshire), and became the founder chairman of the Board of Governors of the Police Staff College in 1947. He retained this role for the rest of his career.\n\nOn 10 August 1948 it was announced that Sir Alexander Maxwell was to retire at the end of September, and that Newsam had been appointed to follow him as Permanent Secretary at the Home Office. In effect this was a delayed promotion; Newsam was already 54, and might easily have reached the rank earlier. At first he had to deal with Chuter Ede as Home Secretary, with whom he had an uneasy relationship (Ede was believed not to trust Newsam's judgment). With Ede maintaining control over the department, Newsam had to deal with routine matters including presenting evidence to the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming.\n\nHowever Newsam did make an important contribution to British relations with Northern Ireland after Taoiseach John A. Costello revealed his government's intention to declare Ireland a Republic. In discussions in December 1948, Newsam first suggested passing a law declaring that Northern Ireland could not be removed from the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Such a provision was included in the Ireland Act 1949. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1950 New Year Honours.\n\nAfter the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, Newsam's activity and knowledge of his department enabled him to assert himself and he was thought to have almost eclipsed the Home Secretaries who were nominally superior. Newsam preferred to deal direct with the Home Secretary, eschewing even the junior Ministers in the department. In 1954, Newsam accepted the invitation to write a book explaining the work of the Home Office for \"The New Whitehall Series\", a series intended \"to provide authoritative descriptions of the present work of the major Departments of the Central Government\" published by George Allen & Unwin Ltd; his was the first to appear.\n\nOne of Newsam's principal concerns was the operation of capital punishment. While Deputy Under-Secretary he had strongly advised against reprieving John Amery, son of a leading Conservative politician who had pleaded guilty to treason during World War II; he believed that reprieving Amery would be a weak move that would look like a political fix. He also opposed a reprieve for William Joyce (nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw), convicted of treason for propaganda broadcasting during the war. In 1949 Newsam gave evidence for the Home Office at the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment under Sir Ernest Gowers, largely defending the established system.\n\nOnce he became Permanent Secretary, Newsam had personal involvement in the process whereby the Home Secretary decided whether to reprieve those condemned to death; for instance, he signed the letters informing the prisoners' families of the Home Secretary's decision.\n\nHe also received the families and legal representatives of those condemned to death while they pleaded for a reprieve from the Home Secretary. On 12 July 1955, Newsam was summoned back from Ascot Racecourse to meet Ruth Ellis' solicitor who wished to present new evidence. In another murder case, William Bentley wrote that Newsam spent an hour with him and his daughter while they related the difficult medical history of his condemned son Derek Bentley, and that \"Sir Frank listened sympathetically, but made no comment\". Material released by the Public Record Office in 1992 revealed that Newsam had argued for a reprieve with the words \"My own view is towards leniency\". Philip Allen later wrote that Newsam was \"gravely concerned\" when Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe disregarded his recommendation and refused to reprieve Bentley.\n\nAs a civil servant, Newsam's own views on capital punishment were not public. Long after Newsam's death, an academic journal article reported three separate views of people who knew Newsam well, all of whom believed that he supported retaining capital punishment. Towards the end of his career, Newsam developed the important distinction between capital and non-capital murder, which was enacted in the Homicide Act 1957.\n\nThe Home Office had the responsibility of dealing with any civil emergency matter which might arise, and Newsam took personal charge as chairman of the official committee on emergencies. In 1953 the storm tide of the North Sea caused severe flooding along the East coast; Newsam controlled the direction of all the resources of the government in repairing sea defences and homes, including taking charge of very large numbers of troops who provided an emergency workforce. Rab Butler wrote that he \"had almost literally taken charge of the country\" and \"secured achievements that would have surprised Canute\".\n\nThe main business of the emergencies committee was to cope with strikes, and here Newsam was cautious that the Government should not intervene incorrectly or excessively (particularly if asked to call out troops), because the likely effect would be to cause the strike to spread. Newsam was thought to have been at his best in an emergency when he had to be decisive and authoritative. On 1 July 1955 he was appointed Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John.\n\nIn 1954 Newsam was caught up in a diplomatic incident over Antoni Klimowicz, a 24-year-old Polish man who stowed away on the ship \"Jarosław Dąbrowski\" and attempted to go ashore in London and claim asylum. Klimowicz was spotted by the crew and detained on the ship. Newsam sent Home Office lawyers to obtain a writ of \"habeas corpus\" and then arranged for 120 police officers, led in person by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (Sir John Nott-Bower) to board the ship and rescue Klimowicz on 31 July. The Polish Embassy protested, but Klimowicz was allowed to stay.\n\nHowever Newsam's intervention in another matter was less successful: in late 1956 Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George accepted Newsam's advice and authorised the telephone tapping of Billy Hill, a known criminal. At the time gang warfare had broken out in London between Hill and rival gangster Jack Spot. The Bar council approached the police and requested the tapes in order to provide evidence for an investigation into the professional conduct of Hill's barrister, Patrick Marrinan.\n\nWhen this use of tapping powers was revealed in June 1957 (by which time Rab Butler had succeeded Lloyd George), there was a major row with the Leader of the Opposition Hugh Gaitskell demanding a full explanation. Butler pledged that it would not be a precedent and that he would consider withdrawing the evidence and asking the Bar council to disregard it. Marrinan was subsequently disbarred and expelled by Lincoln's Inn, but Butler was forced to appoint a committee of Privy Counsellors under Sir Norman Birkett to look into the prerogative power of intercepting telephone communications.\n\nWhen Rab Butler arrived at the Home Office, he quickly decided that his own wish to take charge and reform the department was likely to bring him into conflict with Newsam. He quietly persuaded Newsam to retire. For his part Newsam was well beyond normal retirement age for a civil servant and accepted, fixing his last day in office as 30 September 1957. A few days after his retirement was announced, Newsam was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours.\n\nIn retirement, Newsam was commissioned by the British Medical Association to report into whether it was realistic for doctors to withdraw from the National Health Service should their pay demand be rejected. He found that the threat to withdraw was unrealistic, and that public opinion would not easily forgive a move on behalf of doctors to undermine the NHS. Newsam's conclusion was unwelcome to the BMA which officially dissociated itself from it. He also served on the police committee of the British Transport Commission. Newsam's health had begun to decline during his last years in office, and he died of cancer at his home in Paddington on 25 April 1964. His name lived on as the Police Staff College inaugurated the 'Frank Newsam Memorial Lectures' on criminal justice matters.\n\nNewsam was described by Philip Allen, who served under him, as a \"born leader\" and a superb chairman of any meeting, with a strong personality which tended to drive his solutions forward. He was a good negotiator, but Allen and others agreed that Newsam could show impatience and intolerance if other people disagreed with him. While a very good professional administrator, his interest was not in organisation but in problem-solving. In speech he was said to be eloquent and able to produce surprising pieces of knowledge; and several comment on the fact that he had good looks which suggested foreign origins. Newsam enjoyed gambling on horse-racing and enjoyed high living; he was known to drink a great deal.\n\nNewsam's wife Janet, whom he married in December 1927, was from South Africa. She left London to live in Wylye, Wiltshire during World War II, and liked the countryside so much that she never returned to live in London. Newsam saw her most weekends but remained living in London after he retired; the couple remained very friendly but did not see much of each other, and they had no children.\n"}

Zazou stressed that tourists should feel secure in Egypt.\n\nIn June 2013, Zazou submitted his resignation in protest at President Morsi's appointment of a member of the Construction and Development party as governor of Luxor - this party being associated with the Jama'a al-Islamiya group, which had killed 62 tourists and local tourism-industry workers in the 1997 Luxor Massacre. Zazou's resignation placed him at the head of a mass protest from all quarters of the Egyptian tourism industry, a main source of foreign currency that is vital to the country's economy. Prime Minister Hisham Qandil \"refused the resignation and asked him to stay at his post to review the situation\". A few days later the new governor resigned instead.\n\nHowever, he and four other ministers resigned from office on 1 July due to government's reaction to mass demonstrations in the country.

Fox\n\nJohn Gaston \"Jack\" Fox (March 5, 1916 – July 24, 1980) was an American nuclear physicist. He earned his PhD from Princeton in 1941 and was soon recruited to work on the Manhattan Project. He later moved to Pittsburgh where he spent the rest of his career as a professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University. He is best known for his work in the 1960s, applying the results of the extinction theorem to the then-current body of experimental evidence relating to both special relativity and emission theory.\n\nJack Fox, as he was always known, was born in Biggar, Saskatchewan. He moved with his mother to Victoria at age 13, and left high school two years early to attend Victoria College. He went on to the University of Saskatchewan for his MS and Princeton for his PhD, both in physics. He worked briefly in industry before going to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos for the duration of World War II. In 1947, he married Constance Sullivan of Victoria; they moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he had joined the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later Carnegie Mellon). They both became U.S. citizens in 1955, and raised three children in the suburb of Oakmont, Pennsylvania. Fox died in Pittsburgh in 1980.\n\nThe second postulate of Einstein's theory of special relativity states that the speed of light is invariant, regardless of the velocity of the source from which the light emanates. The extinction theorem (essentially) states that light passing through a transparent medium is simultaneously extinguished and re-emitted by the medium itself. This implies that information about the velocity of light from a moving source might be lost if the light passes through enough intervening transparent material before being measured. All measurements previous to the 1960s intending to verify the constancy of the speed of light from moving sources (primarily using moving mirrors, or extraterrestrial sources) were made only after the light had passed through such stationary material — that material being that of a glass lens, the terrestrial atmosphere, or even the incomplete vacuum of deep space. In 1961, Fox decided that there might not yet be any conclusive evidence for the second postulate: \"This is a surprising situation in which to find ourselves half a century after the inception of special relativity.\" Regardless, he remained fully confident in special relativity, noting that this created only a \"small gap\" in the experimental record.\n\nFox suggested that better experiments were possible, in order to close that \"small gap\". Since photons with higher energies will, on average, travel much farther in any material before being extinguished and re-emitted, experiments using gamma rays instead of lower-energy visible light or x-rays would be dramatically less sensitive to the extinction problem. In 1963, along with T. A. Filippas (also of Carnegie Tech), Fox examined 68 MeV gamma rays emitted in the forward and backward directions by neutral pions moving at 0.2\"c\", i.e., two-tenths the speed of light. The classical velocities of those photons should have been 1.2\"c\" and 0.8\"c\", respectively, but this was not the case. The experiment, perhaps the earliest to be considered free of extinction effects, was successful: \"We conclude that our results provide strong evidence that the velocity of radiation from a moving source is not the classical vector sum of \"c\" and the velocity of the source. Within our accuracy, the resultant sum is \"c\" as required by special relativity.\"\n\nThe emission theory of Walter Ritz was considered early on to be an alternative to Einstein's special relativity. A key difference between the two is that under emission theory, the speed of light is expected to vary along with the speed of its source. Emission theory had long been disfavored by the 1960s, but Fox realized that the effects of extinction on the measurement of the speed of light nullified much of the accepted evidence against it.\nSo in 1964, while still a firm believer in special relativity, Fox decided it was necessary to critically reexamine all of the evidence against Ritz's theory. In doing so, he showed that most of the previous rejections of Ritz's ideas based on theoretical arguments were invalid, including all of those enumerated by Wolfgang Pauli in his 1921 monograph on relativity. In addition, most previous experimental results disfavoring emission theory could be discarded as well, once extinction effects were considered, since the light (or other radiation) whose speed was measured was all actually re-emitted somewhere other than the original moving source. But Fox determined that his own work with Filippas, as well as very current work done at the CERN laboratory using 6 GeV gamma rays from neutral pions moving at very close to \"c\", did, conclusively, support special relativity. His summary: \"Our general conclusion is that there is still a good case against emission theories but that the evidence is different from and less than it has been thought to be.\"\n\nIn the late 1940s and 1950s, Fox was part of the Carnegie Tech team that created the then state-of-the-art 450 MeV synchrocyclotron at the Nuclear Research Center in nearby Saxonburg. (The experiment with Filippas, noted earlier, was performed at this facility.) He served as head of Carnegie Tech's department of physics from 1955 to 1961. In 1962/63, Fox spent a sabbatical year in France at the , in part because of the new synchrocyclotron installed there. In 1967/68 and 1971/72, Fox spent a total of three years living and working in India at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology, in Kanpur, first as a visiting faculty member, and then as administrative head of the Kanpur Indo-American Program. Fox was also a consultant to the Nuclear Medicine Department of St. Francis General Hospital, in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn 2004, Alberto Martínez examined the rejection of Ritz's emission theory in favor of special relativity from a historical perspective. That work discusses Fox's findings at some length.\n"}

Garn became the first sitting member of the United States Congress to fly in space when he flew aboard the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" as a Payload Specialist during NASA mission STS-51-D (April 12–19, 1985).\n\nBorn in Richfield, Utah, Garn earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business and finance from the University of Utah in 1955, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He also attended East High School, Clayton Middle School, and Uintah Elementary School.\n\nSenator Garn is a former insurance executive. He served in the United States Navy as a Martin P5M Marlin pilot. He also served as a pilot of the 151st Air Refueling Group of the Utah Air National Guard, where he flew the Boeing KC-97L and KC-135A. He retired as a Colonel in April 1979. He was promoted to Brigadier General after his space shuttle mission. He has flown more than 10,000 hours in military and private civilian aircraft.\n\nPrior to his election to the Senate, Garn served on the Salt Lake City commission for four years and was elected as the mayor in 1971, entering office in 1972. He was the last Republican to hold that office to date. Garn was active in the Utah League of Cities and Towns and served as its president in 1972. In 1974, Garn was the first vice-president of the National League of Cities, and he served as its honorary president in 1975.\n\nGarn was first elected to the Senate in 1974, succeeding retiring Republican Wallace Bennett, father of later Senator Robert Bennett. Garn was re-elected to a second term in November 1980 with 74 percent of the vote, the largest victory in a statewide race in Utah history. Garn was re-elected a second time in 1986.\n\nThough strongly pro-life, Garn joined U.S. Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois in resigning from the board of the United States Pro-Life Political Action Committee when the executive director of the organization, Peter Gemma, issued a \"hit list\" to target certain lawmakers who supported abortion. Garn and Hyde, the author of the Hyde Amendment, which limited abortions financed by Medicaid, said that \"hit lists\" are counterproductive because they create irrevocable discord among legislators, any of whom can be subject to a \"single issue\" attack of this kind by one interest group or another. Gemma said that he was surprised by the withdrawal of Garn and Hyde from the PAC committee but continued with plans to spend $650,000 for the 1982 elections on behalf of anti-abortion candidates.\n\nGarn was chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and served on three subcommittees: Housing and Urban Affairs, Financial Institutions, and International Finance and Monetary Policy. He also was a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and served as Chairman of the HUD-Independent Agencies Subcommittee. He served on four other Appropriations subcommittees: Energy and Water Resources, Defense, Military Construction, and Interior. Garn served as a member of the Republican leadership from 1979 to 1984 as Secretary of the Republican Conference.\n\nHis Institute of Finance has been called a \"hot tub of influence peddling.\"\n\nGarn retired from the Senate in 1992.\n\nAs Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Garn was co-author of the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the law that partially deregulated the savings and loan industry and attempted to forestall the looming Savings and Loan crisis.\n\nGarn asked to fly on the Space Shuttle because he was head of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that dealt with NASA, and had extensive aviation experience. He had previously flown a B-2 Spirit prototype and driven a new Army tank. STS-51-D was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Its primary objective was to deploy two communications satellites, and to perform electrophoresis and echocardiograph operations in space in addition to a number of other experiments. As a payload specialist, Garn's role on the mission was as a congressional observer and as a subject for medical experiments on space motion sickness. At the conclusion of the mission, Garn had traveled over 2.5 million miles in 108 Earth orbits, logging over 167 hours in space.\n\nThe space sickness he experienced during the journey was so severe that a scale for space sickness was jokingly based on him, where \"one Garn\" is the highest possible level of sickness. Some NASA astronauts who opposed the payload specialist program, such as Mike Mullane, believed that Garn's space sickness was evidence of the inappropriateness of flying people with little training. Astronaut Charles F. Bolden, however, described Garn as \"the ideal candidate to do it, because he was a veteran Navy combat pilot who had more flight hours than anyone in the Astronaut Office\". Fellow 51-D payload specialist Charles D. Walker—who also suffered from space sickness on the flight despite having flown before—stated that\n\nThe Jake Garn Mission Simulator and Training Facility, NASA's prime training facility for astronauts in the Shuttle and Space Station programs, is named after him.\n\nUpon his return, he co-authored a novel entitled \"Night Launch\". The book centers around terrorists taking control of the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" during the first NASA–USSR space shuttle flight. It was published in 1989.\n\nGarn married Hazel Rhae Thompson in 1957. Together, they had four children: Jacob, Susan, Ellen, and Jeffrey. Hazel died in an automobile accident in 1976. In 1977, Garn married Kathleen Brewerton, who had a son, Brook, from a previous marriage. Jake and Kathleen had two children together, Matthew and Jennifer.\n\nIn February 1980, Garn was honored by the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, along with U.S. Ambassador Shirley Temple Black, actor James Stewart, singer John Denver, and Tom Abraham, a businessman from Canadian, Texas, who worked with immigrants seeking to become U.S. citizens.\nJake Garn in 1986 donated a kidney to his 27-year-old daughter, Susan Garn Horne, who was experiencing progressive kidney failure as a result of diabetes.\n\n"}

As a young rabbi in Berlin, he was forced to confront the rise of Nazism, and eventually emigrated to the United States in 1937. There he became vice-chairman of the World Jewish Congress, an active member of the World Zionist Organization and a participant in the 1963 Civil Rights March on Washington.\n\nPrinz was born in the village of Bierdzany (near Oppeln), in the Prussian province of Silesia.\n\nPrinz was born to a Jewish family. Early on, he became motivated by a charismatic rabbi and Prinz took an increasing interest in Judaism. His Jewish roots grew even stronger following his mother's death. By 1917, he had also joined Blau Weiss (Blue White), the Zionist youth movement.\n\nAt 21, Joachim Prinz received his Ph.D. in Philosophy, and had minored in Art History, at the University of Giessen. He was ordained as a rabbi at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau. He married Lucie Horovitz, the daughter of the seminary's most prominent professor. She died in Berlin shortly after giving birth to their daughter Lucie. Prinz married Hilde Goldschmidt in 1932. They had three children, Michael (born in Berlin), Jonathan and Deborah (both born in the United States)\n\nAs his prominence grew in Germany and his fears of Hitler's reign coming to fruition, he earned the sponsorship of Rabbi Stephen Wise who was a close adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt. In 1937, Prinz immigrated into the United States. He immediately began lecturing throughout the U.S. for the United Palestine Appeal, established in the 1920s as the fund raising arm in the United States for the Jewish Agency for Israel. It was, essentially, the precursor to what became the American Jewish support base for a nation state of Israel and the United Israel Appeal.\n\nJoachim Prinz settled in New Jersey as the spiritual leader of Temple B'Nai Abraham in Newark.\n\nWithin a short period, Prinz's activism helped him rise to become one of the top leaders within the Jewish organizational structure. He held top leadership positions in the World Jewish Congress, as president of the American Jewish Congress from 1958–1966, and as Chairman of the World Conference of Jewish Organizations. Later, he was a director of the \"Conference of Jewish Material Claims Against Germany\".\n\nPrinz's early involvement in the Zionist movement made him a close ally and friend of the founding leaders of the State of Israel. Prinz was essential to establishing what became the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Prinz was Chairman from 1965-1967.\n\nDr. Prinz devoted much of his life in the United States to the Civil Rights movement. He saw the plight of African American and other minority groups in the context of his own experience under Hitler. Already in 1937, the year of his immigration, Prinz wrote in an article for the German-Jewish periodical \"Der Morgen\":\n\nFrom his early days in Newark, a city with a very large minority community, he spoke from his pulpit about the disgrace of discrimination. He joined the picket lines across America protesting racial prejudice from unequal employment to segregated schools, housing and all other areas of life.\n\nWhile serving as President of the American Jewish Congress, he represented the Jewish community as an organizer of the August 28, 1963, March on Washington. He came to the podium immediately following a stirring spiritual sung by the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson and just before Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Dr. Prinz's address is remembered for its contention that, based on his experience as a rabbi in Nazi Germany after the rise of Hitler, in the face of discrimination, \"the most urgent, the most disgraceful, the most shameful and the most tragic problem is silence.\"\n\n\nDavid Suissa \"Before King, it was Prinz\", \"Jewish Journal\" 4 September 2008\n\n"}

Juana was eventually moved to Budy, a nearby subcamp where she continued her abuse of prisoners.\n\nIn 1944, as German losses mounted, Bormann was transferred to the auxiliary camp at Hindenburg (present-day Zabrze, Poland) in Silesia. In January 1945, she returned to Ravensbrück. In March she arrived at her last post, Bergen-Belsen, near Celle, where she served under Josef Kramer, Irma Grese and Elisabeth Volkenrath (all of whom had served with her in Birkenau.) On 15 April 1945, the British army took Bergen-Belsen, finding over 10,000 corpses and 60,000 survivors. The liberators forced all SS personnel to carry the dead.\n\nBormann was later incarcerated and interrogated by the military, then prosecuted at the Belsen Trial, which lasted from 17 September 1945 to 17 November 1945. The court heard testimony relating to murders she had committed at Auschwitz and Belsen, sometimes unleashing her \"big bad wolfhound\" German shepherd on helpless prisoners. She was found guilty and hanged (along with Grese and Volkenrath) on 13 December 1945. Her executioner, Albert Pierrepoint, later wrote:\"She limped down the corridor looking old and haggard. She was 42 [sic] years old (actual age, 52), standing only a little over five feet. She was trembling as she was put on the scale. In German she said: 'I have my feelings'.\"\n\n"}

He was a candidate for the Libertarian Party nomination for Vice President of the United States in 2016, losing narrowly to former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld. Sharpe was also the Libertarian nominee for Governor of New York in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Sharpe is the founder and Managing Director of Neo-Sage Group, Inc. \n\nSharpe was born on July 12, 1968 in Manhattan, New York and was adopted as an infant. He joined the United States Marines Corps at age 17, and he received a Bachelor's Degree in Anthropology from the University of Maryland University College. After working as an English teacher, Sharpe founded Prime Distribution Inc. (a trucking and distribution company which he later sold) in 2001. In 2004, Sharpe built an online business training company called Neo-Sage Group, Inc., for which he serves as Managing Director.\n\nAs a Libertarian Party activist, Sharpe has outlined a vision to grow the party by encouraging grassroots Libertarian Party campaigns across the country. Sharpe served on the Libertarian National Committee as the Alternate for Region 8, until his resignation in February 2018 because of an internal LNC vote that failed to oust the party's then-vice chair, Arvin Vohra, following public controversial comments made by Vohra.\n\nSharpe was a candidate for the 2016 Libertarian vice presidential nomination. During the 2016 Libertarian National Convention, he placed second on the first ballot with 30.4% of the vote. Because no one received a majority on that ballot, a second ballot vote was held. Sharpe received 46.9% of the vote on the second ballot, finishing second to former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld.\n\nOn July 12, 2017, Sharpe announced his 2018 candidacy for Governor of New York, making him the first person to mount a challenge to incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo. Sharpe received the Libertarian nomination on April 21, 2018 and Andrew Hollister was selected as the Lieutenant Governor nominee for the ticket.\n\nSharpe's campaign raised $102,596 prior to the first filing deadline, which was second to Andrew Cuomo's re-election campaign. As of October 10, 2018, Sharpe raised $449,515 for his campaign, the highest amount ever raised by a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in New York. Sharpe in addition was the only candidate in the race to have visited all 62 counties on the campaign trail. \n\nOn Election Day, Sharpe received 90,816 votes (1.6%) and came in fourth place behind Cuomo, Republican challenger Marc Molinaro, and Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins. Sharpe's vote total achieved automatic ballot access for the Libertarian Party of New York for the first time in the party's history.\n\nSharpe supports reducing regulations such as occupational licensing, as well as legalizing marijuana and decriminalizing other drugs. Sharpe has advocated for raising revenue for New York by selling naming rights to bridges and highways.\n\nSharpe considers himself \"pro-choice\" as well as \"anti-abortion\". He has vowed to reduce the number of abortions in New York state by increasing availability of other options, instead of instituting regulations on abortion.\n\nSharpe favors marijuana legalization, calling for hemp and marijuana to be \"regulated like onions\". Sharpe has said he would pardon those convicted of victimless crimes or otherwise non-violent offenses.\n\nSharpe has supported deregulation to stimulate economic growth, ending the funding of enforcement of unnecessary regulations. In particular, Sharpe has cited occupational licensing as a hurdle to small business, describing mandatory licensing for jobs such as barbers and dog walkers as \"barriers to entry and a tax on the poor.\" Additionally, to reduce the state deficit, Sharpe has called for eliminating unfunded mandates. He has vowed to follow this reduction in state spending with a reduction in property taxes and the ultimate repeal of the New York state income tax.\n\nSharpe has called for the decentralization of education in New York State and has proposed a \"K-10\" model, reducing the span of high school to ready students for the workforce and/or college. Sharpe has also rejected standardized testing until high school. He stated, \"everyone should be able to opt out of testing at any time...it puts kids who have special needs at a huge disadvantage. Kids who do not test well are labeled as dumb.\"\n\nAdditionally, Sharpe has stated he would refuse federal grants for education. He would also abolish the Board of Regents.\n\nSharpe vowed to repeal the NY SAFE Act by 2020 and pardon those convicted under its provisions. Sharpe supports allowing school teachers and staff to carry firearms on school grounds, on a voluntary basis.\n\nSharpe lives with his wife Georgia and their two children in Queens, New York.\n\n! style=\"background-color:#B2BEB5; width: 3px\" |\n\n! style=\"background-color:#B2BEB5; width: 3px\" |\n\n"}

Later he went to the famed Lavra of Saint Sabas in Palestine, before returning to his home region. He founded three monasteries at Mount Galesios near Ephesus, while he himself became a stylite and lived in a pillar. The monks in the monastic communities Lazaros founded lived in individual cells, rather than the cenobitic monasticism of most monasteries; they were even allowed to earn their own income through practicing a handicraft.\n\nLazaros's hagiography was written by his disciple, the \"kellarites\" Gregory; and reworked by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory II of Cyprus, in the late 13th century. According to the description of Alexander Kazhdan, the hagiography \"has few supernatural miracles but many vignettes rich in everyday details: the young Lazaros escaped sexual seduction in the house of a girl whom he accompanied to Chonae; Lazaros's corpse, with the help of the monk Cyril, signed the \"diatyposis\" for the monks; many thefts and quarrels, travels, and visits are described. Gregory focuses on local events, while Constantinople is depicted as a remote city teeming with danger\".\n\n"}

Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed.\n\nThe historical concept and definition of sexual orientation varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word \"gay\" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term \"sexual orientation\" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies. However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s). Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or identity. See homosexuality and bisexuality for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people.\n\nThe high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that \"[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East.

Americans are divided – a thin majority (51 percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42 percent disagree.\"\n"}
{"id": "2009939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009939", "title": "Madame Xanadu", "text": "Madame Xanadu\n\nMadame Xanadu is a comic book mystic published by DC Comics. The character is identified with Nimue, the sorceress from Arthurian mythology made popular by Sir Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\".\n\nThe character debuted in \"Doorway to Nightmare\" #1, (February 1978). The character was designed by cover artist Michael William Kaluta at the request of Joe Orlando (editor), based on Kaluta's unnamed host character (later known as Charity in the pages of \"Starman\") from the DC Comics mystery title \"Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion\" (seen only on that title's indicia page) and the person of Cathy Ann Thiele. The original storyline was developed by David Michelinie and Val Mayerik.\n\n\"Doorway to Nightmare\", introduced in 1978, was the last of the DC \"Mystery\" line of titles in the 1970s that became the forerunner of Vertigo. It did not have a consistent creative team—the intent was to create writer-artist pairings that had never occurred before, except for the cover art of Michael William Kaluta. Madame Xanadu, the star of the series, was not a host but an active participant, albeit never the main character in her stories. The Phantom Stranger was criticized heavily in letter columns for taking a similar approach. The \"Doorway to Nightmare\" strip lasted for ten issues: five in its own series, four in \"The Unexpected\" issues 190, 192, 194 and 195, and one issue of \"Madame Xanadu\", which was DC's second direct sales only comic. The first issue of \"Madame Xanadu\" bore little difference from an issue of \"Doorway to Nightmare\". There were several requests to reprint it in letter columns of \"The Spectre\", but they were refused because that issue gave little background as to her character, although it did introduce Ishtar to the DC Universe, who dated Destruction.\n\nMadame Xanadu was a regular supporting cast member in volumes 2 and 3 of \"The Spectre\", those versions written by Doug Moench (31 issues, 1987–1989) and John Ostrander (62 issues, 1993–1998).\n\nA \"Madame Xanadu\" ongoing series from Vertigo was announced at the 2007 San Diego Comic Con and started in 2008. It was written by Matt Wagner, with art by Amy Reeder Hadley. The series also featured art stints by Kaluta, Joëlle Jones, Marley Zarcone, Laurenn McCubbin, Chrissie Zullo, Celia Calle, and Marian Churchland. The series was concluded after 29 issues, the final one dated January 2011. The series dealt with Madame Xanadu's early life from Arthurian times until the 1960s. Starting with issue 9, the book coincided with the events of the Golden Age DC Universe.\n\nThe \"Doorway to Nightmare\" stories were typically structured around a protagonist stumbling upon Madame Xanadu's shop (stated to be on \"Christy Street\" in the East Village) (changed to Greenwich Village in \"The Unexpected\" #192) and deciding to enter. She (usually) or he would tell a story of romance that was frustrated by an outside element. Xanadu, through a tarot reading, always determined this element to be of an occult nature, then sent the protagonist to do some task in which she would intervene with the use of her powers. Upon concluding the story, the occult element would wind up in a mason jar in her back room. In the first issue, she apparently became trapped in a burning building. The central couple returns to her shop for nostalgia's sake and discovers her to be quite alive. This was a hint at the extent of her powers. The primary variation in the stories was what the occult threat actually was, be it demonic forces, Asian mummies, vampires, incubi, or other supernatural threats. In one story, she fought Azazel, but he looked nothing like in \"The Sandman\".\n\nWhen the title was moved from its own series to a revamped, 68 page and ad-free version of \"The Unexpected\" (the stories were actually expanded from 17 to 22 pages with the move, part of the DC Implosion), she was shown to be friendly with Abel in the inside front covers, which may or may not have been in continuity. She never met Abel in an actual story until \"DC Special Series\" #21, when she and the Phantom Stranger arrive at the House of Mystery with Christmas presents.\n\nMadame Xanadu's origins were explored in the first few arcs of her Vertigo series. According to these stories, her full name was once Nimue Inwudu and she is the youngest sister of Morgana (to become Morgaine Le Fay) and Vivienne, the Lady of the Lake. The sisters are descendants of the Elder Folk, survivors of Atlantis who evolved into the race known as the \"Homo magi\".\n\nMadame Xanadu is the same Nimue who casts an imprisoning spell on her former lover Merlin, blaming him for manipulating Camelot and the course of history for his own gain. Merlin has the last laugh, though, as he succeeds in stripping her magic away from her, forcing her to use potions to maintain her immortality. The mysterious Phantom Stranger influences her betrayal of Merlin and the two continue to meet throughout the centuries, sharing an ambivalent relationship. Shortly after this, either she or the Lady of the Lake (regardless, called \"Nimue\") bore a son to Kon-Sten-Tyne, an ancestor of John Constantine. The child was left with Kon-Sten-Tyne, who sacrificed the boy as a teenager to Eve.\n\nNimue wanders around the world for some time, becoming an advisor to many great rulers. She spends time in Kublai Khan's court at Xanadu, leading to her assumed name of \"Madame Xanadu.\" Again she meets the Phantom Stranger. It does not go as expected, for she learns the Stranger walks outside of the timestream. During the French Revolution, she attempts to advise Marie Antoinette. During this era, she is able to regain her immortality by besting Death in a card game. Other incidents in her long years of life include a doomed lesbian love affair during the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nIn the 1940s, she has a sexual relationship with John Zatara, who wishes to marry her, but she foresees his true love, and the later existence of his daughter, Zatanna, \"a love with whom she could never compete.\" Despite this, she uses Zatara to trap and ensnare the Phantom Stranger, preventing him from witnessing, and affecting, the supernatural origins of the Spectre. This, in turn, prevents Madame Xanadu from interfering, despite having foreseen the potential menace the unchecked Spectre would have brought on Earth. It is revealed that Xanadu's later behavior stems from this earlier fault, her magic parlor being devised as a way to control the supernatural being, ultimately hoping to restrain and quell his rage.\n\nEventually, Madame Xanadu decides that she wants to atone for her sins and begins operating the fortune-telling parlor out of \"the Village\". She however remains without any real magic might of her own, which has led her to manipulate various forces in order to gain power. Having developed herself as an advisor, she now meets clientele plagued by supernatural problems. Although she can advise them, some force prevents her from directly interfering in solving their troubles. If one of her clients manages to conquer a supernatural force, she can contain that entity in jars within her fortune parlor to prevent it from causing any further trouble.\n\nWhen the Spectre is destroyed by the Anti-Monitor, Madame Xanadu performs a magic ritual that brings him back to existence. From that day forward she acts as the Spectre's spiritual advisor while he is bound to the soul of Jim Corrigan. At first, Xanadu tries to lead Corrigan astray in order to use the Spectre-Force for her own agendas. She is depicted in a nude love scene with the Spectre in the form of mist, although readers in the letters column did not find this clear and Xanadu's nudity gratuitous. Subsequent issues made clear that this was a romantic relationship, but no more nudity was used.\n\nOver the course of their affiliation however, a strange form of friendship grows between Corrigan and Madame Xanadu. Over time, Madame Xanadu is instrumental in ensuring the safety of Corrigan's soul, stopping the various rampages of the Spectre, and ultimately shows up at Jim Corrigan's funeral not as an advisor or enemy, but as his friend. She even sheds a tear as Jim Corrigan's soul leaves the mortal plane to go to Heaven.\n\nShe is also consulted by the Suicide Squad about the increasing difficultly of dealing with Enchantress. She provides the Squad with a ring and necklace that can harm the Enchantress if she tries to use her powers against the ring-bearers' wishes.\n\nMadame Xanadu also gives Timothy Hunter a reading, helping him along his path as an emerging sorcerer. She also confronts Tim's companion John Constantine, whom she believes stole a magic artifact called the Wind's Egg from her.\n\nAlthough Madame Xanadu, among others, has no great love for or trust in the Phantom Stranger, she is a member of the Sentinels of Magic, a loose group of mages and mystics that are called upon to thwart Asmodel's uprising in Hell. Nonetheless, she prefers to operate alone and is one of the few heroes who outright refuses to ally herself with the Stranger.\n\nIn order to gain more power, Madame Xanadu bartered her soul to the demon Neron, who gave her three loyal demons named Bathopet, Maw and Atopeh to do her commands. At first, the demons responded to her every whim and almost raged out of her control. Over time, as she controlled her own emotions, she became able to control the demons as well.\n\nIn \"Day of Vengeance\" #2, an \"Infinite Crisis\" tie-in, the Spectre, then unstable and believing that magic equaled evil, disabled Madame Xanadu and took her eyes.\n\nIn the \"Day of Vengeance\" special it is revealed that Madame Xanadu is still blind. She has regrown her eyes 14 times, only for them to be burned out again, because the Spectre's powers are beyond hers. However, Madame Xanadu's abode would be the rallying point of the offense against the Spectre, gathering the Phantom Stranger, Zatanna, and Nabu.\n\nXanadu has also found a way around the Spectre's curse by training an adept, Daena, to read the cards for her. Through Daena, she sees the destruction of the world with the Spectre winning and destroying everything. It is at her place that Nabu begins his offense against the Spectre as well as the strategy for restoring the Rock of Eternity.\n\nMadame Xanadu's standing in the new magic order has yet to be explored in detail. However, it is known that she is still trying to cure her blindness. She assists the Shadowpact when members of their team were temporarily blinded by the mystical powers of the villains known as 'the Congregation.' It is the mystical aspect that allows her to help, though some of the group are able to heal the blindness on their own.\n\nMadame Xanadu appears in \"Countdown\" #50, operating out of \"Hokus & Pokus Occult Curiosities\" in Greenwich Village. She is unable to help Mary Marvel locate Captain Marvel Jr. She does advise Mary to avoid Gotham City, because \"it isn't safe for magic.\"\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Madame Xanadu has resurfaced as the result of Barry Allen's unintentional tampering with the timestream and the merging of the Vertigo, WildStorm and DC Universes.\n\nIn the new continuity Xanadu is no longer blind, and despite her past as Nimue still applying, she seems to have taken a more proactive stance during the Fall of Camelot. Instead of quietly observing like she did in her core miniseries, she staunchly opposed the surrendering of Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake, and then started traveling with Jason Blood, meeting other Dark Ages-based heroes and villains as Vandal Savage and the Shining Knight. Furthermore, the Dark Ages Madame Xanadu is seen in a relationship with both Etrigan and Jason Blood, each one believing she was humoring the other for the sake of their forced merging.\n\nThe present-day Madame Xanadu is featured in the DC Universe reboot, in \"Justice League Dark\", resuming her role as the keystone and supporter of the magical community in the DCU. Xanadu assists the 'Dark League' in various incidents, such as Zatanna vanishing and the House of Mystery letting loose demonic threats in Manhattan. She is at length revealed to be the mother of the supervillain Doctor Destiny.\n\n\"National Comics\" was announced on April 6, 2012, as a revival of the anthology title, to be launched in July 2012 and to expand upon the New 52 universe by presenting single-issue stories about different DC characters, each by a different creative team.\nThis includes \"Madame X\" #1 by Rob Williams and drawn by Trevor Hairsine and Fiona Staples.\n\nMadame Xanadu has a supernatural sensitivity to occult activities and mystic phenomena. She uses tarot cards to interpret what she senses, and is also able to tell the future of others. Xanadu can levitate objects, teleport herself, and banish demons. Madame Xanadu's parlor is full of magical books and objects, as well as jars containing the essences of malevolent entities. She rarely uses these objects of power, merely acting as a guardian of them.\n\nMadame Xanadu is immortal, never aging and unable to die of natural causes thanks to her deal with Death. In the DC Universe, she may be outright unkillable even by beings such as the Spectre.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\", Madame Xanadu is still a fortune-teller. Traci Thirteen teleported to where Madame Xanadu is located and discovers that Madame Xanadu is dying. Before dying, Madame Xanadu tells her to stop the instigated Doctor Thirteen.\n\nIn the Tangent Comics series \"Joker's Wild\", Madame Xanadu is one of three women who masquerade as a heroic version of the Joker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This also led to her membership on the EU sub-committees listed above.\n\nAs a consequence of her illness, Lady Mar founded the organisation \"Forward-ME\" to co-ordinate the activities of a fairly broad spectrum of charities and voluntary organisations working with patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, which is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).\n\nLady Mar has married three times: first to Edwin Noel Artiss, then to John Salton, and finally to John Jenkin. From the first marriage she had a daughter: Susan Helen of Mar, Mistress of Mar (born 1963), the heiress presumptive to her mother's peerage. Lady Susan is married to Bruce Alexander Wyllie, and has two daughters, Isabel and Frances.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

He was nephew of Patrick Joseph Power, MP for East Waterford from 1885 to 1913. He attended Clongowes Wood College. He resided at Ballyowen House, Dualla, Cashel, County Tipperary, was an \"extensive farmer\" and was a member of the Tipperary Hunt.\n\nHe was a founder member of Sinn Féin in 1905. He joined the Gaelic League in 1909 and was a member of the Irish Volunteers from 1914 onward.\n\nAfter more than 2,000 German and Austrian prisoners were imprisoned at Richmond Barracks, Templemore following the first battles of World War I in 1914, he plotted to engineer a mass escape but was thwarted when the prisoners were removed to Leigh, Lancashire in 1915. He was interned in 1916 after the Easter Rising for several months in Richmond Barracks, Dublin, and Knutsford, England. In May 1918, he was arrested under the German Plot and detained in Gloucester Jail.\n\nMcCan was president of the East Tipperary executive of Sinn Féin. While incarcerated, he elected as a Sinn Féin MP for the East Tipperary constituency at the 1918 general election.\n\nIn January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled in the Mansion House, Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann. McCan never sat in Dáil Éireann, dying in prison in 1919 during the 1918 flu pandemic. On 9 March 1919, McCan was buried in Dualla, Cashel, County Tipperary.\n\nNo by-election was called to replace him in the UK constituency. After 1 April 1922, the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922 prohibited any by-election, and the constituency was abolished when parliament was dissolved on 26 October 1922 for the general election on 15 November.\n\nThe First Dáil also considered how to fill the vacancy; a select committee in April recommended that the local Sinn Féin organisation which nominated him should nominate his replacement; a June proposal to postpone action, either for six months or until a Westminster by-election was held, was referred to another committee, which recommended that \"in view of the circumstances which occasioned the vacancy, it was due to the memory of the late Pierce McCann that his place should not be filled at present\".\n\nOn 10 April 1919, Cathal Brugha told the First Dáil: \"Before I formally move the motion, as I have mentioned the name of Pierce McCan, I would ask the Members of the Dáil to stand up as a mark of our respect to the first man of our body to die for Ireland, and of our sympathy with his relatives. We are sure that their sorrow is lightened by the fact that his death was for the cause for which he would have lived, and that his memory will ever be cherished in the hearts of the comrades who knew him, and will be honoured by succeeding generations of his countrymen with that of the other martyrs of our holy cause.\" The McCan Barracks in Templemore, County Tipperary, is named after him.\n\nIn the general election of January 1933, McCan's brother, Joseph, a member of the National Farmers' and Ratepayers' Association, stood unsuccessfully for the National Centre Party in the Tipperary constituency.\n\n\n\n"}

He is well known for communicating economic ideas in understandable terms as host of the \"EconTalk\" podcast.\n\nRoberts categorizes himself as a proponent of classical economic liberalism. He has said, \"I believe in limited government combined with personal responsibility. So I am something of a libertarian, but . . . that term comes with some baggage and some confusion.\"\n\nRoberts was awarded a B.A. in economics in 1975 from the University of North Carolina and Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1981 for his thesis on the design of government transfer programs under the supervision of Gary Becker.\n\nRoberts has taught at George Mason University, Washington University in St. Louis (where he was the founding director of what is now the Center for Experiential Learning), the University of Rochester, Stanford University, and the University of California, Los Angeles. He is a regular commentator on business and economics for National Public Radio's \"Morning Edition\", and has written for \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\".\n\nRoberts also blogs at \"Cafe Hayek\" with Donald J. Boudreaux at George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia.\n\nRoberts has written a number of books which illustrate economic concepts in unconventional ways.\n\nIn 2001 he published the novel \"The Invisible Heart: An Economic Romance\", which conveys economic ideas through conversations between two fictional teachers at an exclusive high school in Washington, D.C.: one is a market oriented economics instructor, and the other is an English teacher who wants governmental protections that curb the excesses of unrestrained capitalism.\n\nIn 2008, Roberts released another novel, \"The Price of Everything: A Parable of Possibility and Prosperity\", which focuses on the experiences of Ramon Fernandez, a university student and star tennis player who, as a child, accompanied his mother to the U.S. after she fled from Fidel Castro's Cuba. Like \"The Invisible Heart\", \"The Price of Everything\" uses conversations between its main characters to address economic concepts (in this case ideas such as the price system, spontaneous order and the possibility of price gouging in crisis situations).\n\nIn 2014 Roberts offered an uncommon perspective on Adam Smith in his book, \"How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human Nature and Happiness\". The book does not discuss Smith's well known 1776 work, \"The Wealth of Nations\"; it instead examines Smith's 1759 precursor to behavioral economics, \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\".\n\nRoberts generally opposes Keynesian economics - particularly stimulus spending - saying that \"it's very hard to argue in logical terms that spending money unwisely is the way to get wealthy.\" In October 2011 he initiated a lively, extended conversation with the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman over the effectiveness of Keynesian policies by declaring that \"Krugman is a Keynesian because he wants bigger government. I'm an anti-Keynesian because I want smaller government.\" Krugman quoted this statement in his response and then said that \"Keynesianism is not and never has been about promoting bigger government,\" and also that \"you find conservative economists promoting quite Keynesian views of stabilization policy.\" In subsequent posts, the two economists disagreed on many things, but neither one contested one central idea: Krugman was content to be characterized as a Keynesian, while Roberts, most definitely, was not.\n\nRoberts has urged those who formulate public policy and the economists who advise them to be more skeptical of the findings of empirical studies, and he views ultra-specific claims by politicians that their promoted policies will produce a certain number of jobs or a certain amount of growth as inherently unreliable.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3060634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3060634", "title": "Sexuality of Jesus", "text": "Sexuality of Jesus\n\nOn the issue of the sexuality of Jesus, the traditional understanding of Christian churches is that Jesus did not marry and remained celibate until his death. That has not prevented speculation about alternative theories of his sexuality. The Gospels and the New Testament reveal little on the subject.\n\nThe non-canonical Gospel of Philip (dating from around the third century) describes Jesus's relationship with Mary Magdalene using Coptic variants of the Greek κοινωνός (\"koinōnos\"). That work uses cognates of \"koinōnos\" and Coptic equivalents to refer to the literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse, but also metaphorically, referring to a spiritual partnership, and the reunification of the Gnostic Christian with the divine realm.\n\nMary Magdalene is mentioned as one of three Marys \"who always walked with the Lord\" and as his companion (Philip 59.6–11). The work also says that the Lord loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often (63.34–36). Author John Dickson argues that it was common in early Christianity to kiss a fellow believer by way of greeting, thus such kissing would have no romantic connotations. Kripal writes that \"the historical sources are simply too contradictory and simultaneously too silent\" to make absolute declarations regarding Jesus' sexuality.\n\nBart Ehrman concludes that historical evidence tells us nothing at all about Jesus' sexuality—\"certainly nothing to indicate that Jesus and Mary had a sexual relationship of any kind\". Ehrman (a scholar of the Greek New Testament and Early Christianity) says that the question people ask him most often is whether Mary Magdalene and Jesus of Nazareth married each other: \"It is not true that the Dead Sea Scrolls contained Gospels that discussed Mary and Jesus. (...) Nor is it true that the marriage of Mary and Jesus is repeatedly discussed in the Gospels that didn't make it into the New Testament. In fact, it is never discussed at all—never even mentioned, not even once. (...) It is not true that the Gospel of Philip calls Mary Jesus' spouse.\"\n\nThe Gospel of John makes references to the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" (John , , ), a phrase which does not occur in the Synoptic Gospels. In the text, this \"beloved disciple\" is present at the crucifixion of Jesus, with Jesus' mother, Mary.\n\nThe \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" may be a self-reference by the author of the Gospel (John 21:24), traditionally regarded as John the Apostle. Rollan McCleary, author of \"Signs for a Messiah\", thinks this identification would make the phrase highly significant.\n\nIn subsequent centuries the reference was used by those who implied a homosocial or homoerotic reading of the relationship. For example, Saint Aelred of Rievaulx, in his work \"De spiritali amicitia\" (\"Spiritual Friendship\"), referred to the relationship of Jesus and John the Apostle as a \"marriage\" and held it out as an example sanctioning friendships between clerics.\n\nJames I of England may have been relying on a pre-existing tradition when he defended his relationship with the young Duke of Buckingham: \"I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed. Christ had his son John, and I have my George.\"\n\nOthers who have given voice to this interpretation of the relationship between Jesus and John have been the philosophers Denis Diderot and Jeremy Bentham. However, many other researchers reject the theory.\n\nGene Robinson discussed the possible homoerotic inclinations of Jesus in a sermon in 2005. Robinson's claim has been widely criticized, most notably by David W. Virtue, who called it an \"appalling deconstructionism from the liberal lobby which will spin even the remotest thing to turn it into a hint that Biblical figures are gay\".\n\nBob Goss the author of \"Jesus Acted Up, A Gay and Lesbian Manifesto\" and \"Queering Christ, Beyond Jesus Acted Up\", said of the interaction between Jesus and John, it \"is a pederastic relationship between an older man and a younger man. A Greek reader would understand.\" (see Pederasty in Ancient Greece).\n\nIn contrast, the writer Robert Gagnon has argued that the Greek word translated as \"loved\" is agape (used, for example, in John ; \"for God so loved the world\"), rather than the Greek word referring to sexual love, \"\".\n\nThe Gospel of Mark (14:51–53), describes how in the Garden of Gethsemane, \"A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they [the Temple guards] seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.\"\n\nThe text of the naked youth is puzzling for conventional interpreters because it associates an unnamed and suggestively erotic youth very closely with Jesus. Moreover, the text only appears in Mark which has led to the tradition that Mark wrote himself into the text.\n\nThe separate and non-canonical \"Secret Gospel of Mark\"—fragments of which were contained in the controversial Mar Saba letter by Clement of Alexandria, which Morton Smith claimed to have discovered in 1958—states that Jesus during one night taught \"the mystery of the kingdom of God\" alone to a youth wearing a linen cloth. This has been linked to the views of an ancient group called the Carpocratians. Some modern commentators interpret it as a baptism, others as some form of sexual initiation, and others as an allegory for a non-sexual initiation into a gnostic sect. However, the authorship of \"Secret Mark\" is still a matter of debate and many scholars consider it to be Smith's forgery, while others believe it to be a modern apocryphon.\n\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is reported to have referred to the behaviour of eunuchs to illustrate an approach to sexuality: \"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\" (Matthew )\n\nThe term \"eunuch\" normally referred to a castrated man. Several theologians and Bible commentators have interpreted this passage as indicating Jesus's support for celibacy.\n\nThe early Christian writer Origen interpreted Jesus' words literally and so physically castrated himself as an act of devotion. The early Church Father Tertullian wrote that Jesus himself lived as a \"eunuch\", likewise encouraged people to adopt this practice.\n\nThe Bride of Christ is a metaphor for the Ecclesia (church), likening the relationship between Christians and Jesus to a betrothal pointing to a future wedding, when Christians are re-united with Jesus. In the Gospel of John (), John the baptist speaks in terms of himself as a \"best man\" with the implication that Christ the bridegroom (see also Matthew ) is coming to meet his bride, although there is nothing specific to identify the bride. Church Fathers such as Cyprian applied the image to the Church.\n\nEarly Latter Day Saint Apostle Orson Hyde taught that Jesus was a polygamist who was married to Mary Magdalene, Martha, and Mary of Bethany, and fathered children with them. He also taught that the marriage at Cana was Jesus' own wedding. This idea is not official LDS doctrine, although it has certainly entered into Mormon folklore.\n\nThe \"Children of God\" Christian group actively promotes the view that a sexual relationship with Jesus would be desirable, encouraging devotees to imagine during sexual activity that it is Jesus who is having sex with them, and equate prophecy with Jesus' ejaculation. Historic Christian figures have also been accused of similar thoughts. Teresa of Avila's description of her most famous vision has been interpreted by secular writers, such as Dan Brown, as \"a metaphor for some serious sex\"; the view of Teresa having a sexual relationship with Jesus, in her visions, is exemplified by the poster art for \"\", a 2007 film by Ray Loriga.\n\nThe fictional poem \"The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name\" speculated what it would have been like if Jesus had had several sexual encounters with other men—including with Pontius Pilate, and a graphic description of Jesus' sexual encounter with a Roman soldier; Christian opposition to the poem's suggestions resulted in the \"Whitehouse v. Lemon\" court case, a famous blasphemous libel trial.\n\nThe sadomasochistic undertones of the crucifixion have been commented upon, and occasionally portrayed explicitly in modern art; for satirical reasons, this was depicted in the controversial \"Jesus with erection\" poster, a concept which has also been depicted for serious reasons in sculpture by Terence Koh.\n\n"}

The group stars in the popular television series \"Impractical Jokers\", which premiered on December 15, 2011. The program currently airs on truTV in the U.S. and on Comedy Central in the UK, Ireland, and India.\n\nThe comedians met in religion class during freshman year at Monsignor Farrell High School on Staten Island in 1990. They became interested in drama and improv and joined an improv club because \"it was the only way to meet girls\", as their private high school was only for boys. Sal Vulcano kept a list of words that they'd be embarrassed to say in a public setting. When searching for a name for their comedy troupe, Sal's list, which included \"culottes\", \"gargoyle\", and \"nougat\", was used. The group eventually chose \"the Tenderloins\".\n\nAfter finishing college, James Murray worked for the Staten Island Ferry where he ran into his friend Sal. They reminisced about their enjoyment doing improv. After reuniting with Joe and another friend, Mike Boccio, they practiced improv at Joe's house three days a week, for six months. The Tenderloins began in 1999 as a live improv comedy and sketch comedy troupe.\n\nThey have performed in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and participated in the San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival and the Miami Improv Festival.\n\nThe troupe briefly consisted of five members. However, Gideon Horowitz soon left the group for personal reasons.\n\nAfter the success of \"Impractical Jokers\", the Tenderloins have also taken part in several American and international tours.\n\nFollowing years of live shows, in 2006, the Tenderloins redirected their talents to filmed comedic sketches. Brian Quinn subsequently replaced Mike Boccio as the troupe's fourth member.\n\nThe Tenderloins' comedic sketches have accumulated millions of views on YouTube, MySpace, Metacafe, and other websites. In 2007, the troupe won the $100,000 grand prize in the NBC \"It’s Your Show\" competition for the sketch \"Time Thugs\".\n\nFollowing the troupe's online successes, the four were signed to develop a scripted comedy pilot for Spike TV based on their own lives. The pilot was shot on location in 2008 on Staten Island, as well as at other locations around New York City. Spike TV ultimately passed on the series. A second pilot starring the Tenderloins was officially selected for the 2009 New York Television Festival.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, truTV announced a new series to star the Tenderloins. \"Impractical Jokers\" premiered on December 15, 2011, executive-produced by the troupe themselves. Season 1 consisted of 16 episodes. The first season was watched by over 32 million viewers.\n\nThe show's second season premiered on December 13, 2012 and consist of 28 episodes. Its third season had 31 episodes and premiered on January 2, 2014. On April 21, 2014, truTV announced that the series would be renewed for a 26-episode fourth season. With the fourth season renewal, a 6-episode spinoff series, \"Jokers Wild!\", was also announced. The show was renewed for a fifth season, which began on February 2016. On July 22, 2016, a sixth season was announced and the sixth season began on February 9, 2017.

TruTV also announced that an Impractical Jokers feature-length movie, \"Impractical Jokers Movie\", will go into production in the spring of 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the troupe will star in a new TBS series, \"Misery Index\", based on the card game \"Shit Happens,\" created by Andy Breckman, who created and wrote the popular TV series \"Monk\" and the recent Netflix series \"The Good Cop\".\n\nIn February 2017, Murr tweeted that he and the group had recorded the first episode of an upcoming limited-run show for SiriusXM Radio. On August 17, 2017, \"The Tenderloins Radio Show\" made its debut on SiriusXM Radio channel 94 (Comedy Greats). In the hour-long broadcast, the comedy troupe pranks friends and acquaintances, takes calls, answers emails from fans, and does sketches in a segment called \"Tenderloins Theatre\". The show airs on Thursdays at 6 p.m ET, with rebroadcasts the following day at 11 a.m ET.\n\nThe group began hosting a podcast in April 2012. It is available on their official website and iTunes.\n\n\"What Say You?\", an occasional podcast hosted by Sal and Q, was named Best New Show at the 2013 Stitcher Awards. The increased popularity of \"What Say You\" sparked a friendly competition among the friends, spurring Joe and Murr to release their own Tenderloins podcast without the other two members. In 2015, \"What Say You?\" was nominated for the Comedy, Entertainment, and Best Produced Podcast Awards at the 10th Annual Podcast Awards. Sal and Q have stated that the podcast is their own side project, not a replacement of \"The Tenderloins Podcast\". The group explained that it was difficult to coordinate the schedules of all four members outside of work, making it challenging to produce their troupe's official podcast with any regularity.\n\nBrian Michael \"Q\"uinn (born March 14, 1976) is an improvisational comedian from the New York City borough of Staten Island. He was born to Carol Murphy and James Quinn. He is the middle of 3 brothers: Jim (older) and Danny (younger).

In one such situation, he asked his friend Joey Fatone to take his place in a challenge. Doctors confirmed that he was suffering from serious encephalitis and meningitis, from which he fully recovered. In 2016, during training by Travis Pastrana for the Impractical Jokers Live Nitro Circus Spectacular, Brian broke two ribs, pulled his neck muscles and suffered nerve damage to his left hip after going airborne and crushing the quad bike he was riding. He announced in the season finale that he would not participate, and his friend, Joey Fatone, again stepped in to replace him.\n\nAn animal lover, Brian has three cats, named Brooklyn, Chessie, and Benjamin (Also known as Mistah Whiskahs). \"Benjamin\" is regularly used as a scare tactic to taunt his friend Sal Vulcano who is afraid of cats. To terrorize Sal, a production crew member from the show wears a black cat costume and chases him. Brian himself is an arachnophobic, which his friends chose to use against him in a punishment. He is also a \"Star Wars\" fan and a supporter of Manchester United, New Jersey Devils and New York Yankees.\n\nHe is currently writing the graphic novel \"Metro\", alongside Walt Flanagan and Cullen Bunn.

He began composing at the age of eight, and studied at the Juilliard School in his youth; he later attended the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with Charles Wuorinen and John Corigliano. He returned to the Juilliard School to earn his Master's in Music, and also pursued further studies at Princeton University with Milton Babbitt. By the age of thirty, Picker had been recognized with numerous awards, including the Joseph H. Bearns Prize (Columbia University), a Charles Ives Scholarship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1992, he received the Award in Music from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, where he was later elected to lifetime membership in 2012.\n\nPicker began composing music at an early age, and was quickly commissioned to compose new works, such as \"Sextet No. 3\", commissioned by Speculum Musicae and premiered at Alice Tully Hall in 1977. In the 1980s, Picker continued to compose instrumental music, and was appointed the first composer-in-residence of the Houston Symphony from 1985-1990. Picker has served as composer-in-residence for such major international festivals as the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival and the Pacific Music Festival.\n\nPicker composed his first song in 1984; throughout the early 1990s, he continued to compose music for voice. In 1994, Picker composed his first opera, \"Emmeline\", commissioned by the Santa Fe Opera, with a libretto by J.D. McClatchy. Since then, he has written numerous celebrated operas, including \"Fantastic Mr. Fox, Thérèse Raquin, An American Tragedy,\" and \"Dolores Claiborne.\" In 2010, Picker composed his first ballet, \"Awakenings\", for the Rambert Dance Company, inspired by the work of Oliver Sacks. Picker was appointed artistic director of Tulsa Opera in 2016.\n\nTobias Picker's music is published exclusively by Schott Music Corporation.\n\nPicker's symphonic music, including the tone poem \"Old and Lost Rivers\", has been performed by major orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the BBC Philharmonic, The Munich Philharmonic, the Tonhalle Orchester Zurich, and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. His piano concerto \"Keys to the City\" (written for the Centenary of the Brooklyn Bridge) is recorded on Chandos with his cello concerto and the orchestral work \"And Suddenly It's Evening\". Following this Chandos release, \"BBC Music Magazine\" proclaimed Picker's recent music \"one of the glories of the current musical scene.\"\n\n\"The Encantadas\" (for narrator and orchestra) features texts drawn from Herman Melville's descriptions of the Galápagos Islands. It was recorded on Virgin Classics by the Houston Symphony Orchestra with narration by Sir John Gielgud.\n\nOther works include \"Tres sonetos de amor\", settings of Neruda love poems in versions for baritone and orchestra, and voice and piano; and \"The Blue Hula\", a work for chamber ensemble. Picker's complete orchestral catalogue includes three symphonies, four piano concertos and concertos for violin, viola, cello and oboe.\n\nPicker has also composed numerous chamber works. In 2009, the American String Quartet commissioned and premiered his \"String Quartet No. 2\" at Merkin Concert Hall in New York. In that same year, the pianist Ursula Oppens premiered Picker's \"Four Etudes for Ursula\" and \"Three Nocturnes for Ursula\" at Baisly Powell Elebash Recital Hall, also in New York. In 2011, Picker was featured in a Miller Theatre \"Composer Portrait\" Concert, featuring the Signal Ensemble, Sarah Rothenberg, and the Brentano String Quartet, who premiered his \"Piano Quintet\" \"Live Oaks\".\n\n\nPicker composed his first ballet, \"Awakenings\" (2010), inspired by the novel by Dr. Oliver Sacks and commissioned by the Rambert Dance Company. The piece was premiered by Rambert in Salford, UK in September 2010. Rambert toured the work around the UK with over 50 performances in the 2010-11 season.\n\n\nAdditional recordings of the composer's music are available on Sony Classics, Virgin, Nonesuch Records, Ondine, Bridge and First Edition, among others.\n\nPicker has been diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome. He has mentioned that there are \"tourettic\" elements to his music. He appeared in a BBC Horizon television documentary, titled \"Mad But Glad\", about the link between Tourette's syndrome and creativity. He has been involved in mentoring programs for children with Tourette's.\n\nPicker has various tics which disappear when he's composing, playing the piano, or conducting. He has said, \"I live my life controlled by Tourette's...but I use music to control it. I have harnessed its energy—I play with it, manipulate it, trick it, mimic it, taunt it, explore it, exploit it, in every possible way.\"\n\nPicker was an acquaintance of neurologist Oliver Sacks. According to Sacks, Picker related that he found his \"problem\" in his life was \"congenital musicality\" rather than Tourette's. Picker began to play the piano at age four, and by age seven found he could reproduce large passages of music. He \"found himself overwhelmed by musical emotion.\" As related by Sacks, \"He said that it was understood, practically from the start, that he would be a musician, and that he had little chance of doing anything else, because his musicality was all-consuming...he sometimes felt that his musicality controlled him, rather than the other way around.\"\n\nPicker's partner since 1980 has been Aryeh Lev Stollman. He is a neuroradiologist and author, and has won a Lambda Literary Award.\n\n"}
{"id": "254515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254515", "title": "Villain", "text": "Villain\n\nA villain (also known as, \"baddie\", \"bad guy\", \"evil guy\", \"heavy\" or \"black hat\") is an \"evil\" character in a story, whether a historical narrative or, especially, a work of fiction. \n\nThe villain is a antagonist (though can be the protagonist) who tends to have a negative effect on other characters. A female villain is occasionally called a villainess. Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines villain as \"a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot\".\n\nVillain comes from the Anglo-French and Old French \"vilain\", which itself descends from the Late Latin word \" villanus\", meaning \"farmhand\", in the sense of someone who is bound to the soil of a \"villa\", which is to say, worked on the equivalent of a plantation in Late Antiquity, in Italy or Gaul. The same etymology produced villein. It referred to a person of less than knightly status and so came to mean a person who was not chivalrous and polite. As a result of many unchivalrous and evil acts, such as treachery or rape, being considered villainous in the modern sense of the word, it became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning. The Germanic word \"churl\", originally meaning \"a non-servile peasant\" and denoting the lowest rank of freemen in Saxon society, had gone through a similar degradation, as did the word \"boor\" which originally meant \"farmer\".\n\nVladimir Propp, in his analysis of Russian fairy tales, concluded that a fairy tale had only eight \"dramatis personae\", of which one was the villain, and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:\n\nNone of these acts necessarily occurs in a fairy tale, but when any of them do, the character that performs the act is the villain. The villain, therefore, could appear twice: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.\n\nWhen a character performed only these acts, the character was a pure villain. Various villains also perform other functions in a fairy tale; a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of \"guidance\" and thus acting as a helper.\n\nThe functions could also be spread out among several characters. If a dragon acted as the villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sisters) might take on the role of the villain and pursue the hero.\n\nTwo other characters could appear in roles that are villainous in the more general sense. One is the false hero: this character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending. Among these characters are Cinderella's stepsisters, chopping off parts of their feet to fit on the shoe. Another character, the dispatcher, sends a hero on his quest. This might be an innocent request, to fulfill a legitimate need, but the dispatcher might also, villainously, lie to send a character on a quest in hopes of being rid of him.\n\nIn fiction, villains commonly function in the dual role of adversary and foil to the story's heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, the villain exemplifies characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.\n\nOthers point out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment, which makes some people identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a characterization that provides a motive for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic Roger Ebert: \"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph.\"\n\nTod Slaughter always portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, cackling, and hand-rubbing (however, this often failed to translate well from stage to screen). Brad Warner states that \"only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad\". Ben Bova recommends to authors that their works not contain villains. He states, in his \"Tips for writers\": \"In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil... Fiction mirrors life. Or, more accurately, fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper, clearer understanding for us. There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds. There are only people with problems, struggling to solve them.\" David Lubar adds: \"This is a brilliant observation that has served me well in all my writing. (The bad guy isn't doing bad stuff so he can rub his hands together and snarl.) He may be driven by greed, neuroses, or the conviction that his cause is just, but he's driven by something, not unlike the things that drive a hero.\"\n\nIn an attempt to add realism to their stories, many writers will try to create \"sympathetic\" villains, the antithesis to an antihero called an anti-villain. These villains come in just as many shapes and sizes as anti-heroes do. Some may wish to make the world a better place but go to antagonistic lengths to do so (such as Doctor Octopus in \"Spider-Man 2\", who commits various crimes in an attempt to complete his goal of creating a cheap, renewable source of energy, and Dr. Horrible in \"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\", who wants to rule the world so that he can solve all of its problems), or may employ a code of honor in fighting his enemies, even if it is to achieve antagonistic goals (examples include Murdock, a secondary villain in the game \"\", who is honorable, but fights the player's army due to loyalty to his country). Other sympathetic villains may be pushed to antagonistic lifestyles by society's mistreatment of him due to prejudice against something he is a part of (such as racism, as is the case in \"American History X\"), but goes to absurd lengths to achieve the equality he desires, like Magneto in the \"X-Men\" comics and films. Others may include those manipulated by malevolent and opprobrious forces (such as Jack Torrance being manipulated by the Overlook Hotel in \"The Shining\"). Plot based video games tend to have two villains where one is sympathetic. This creates a foreseeable plot twist wherein either they die or they switch sides.\n\n"}

Inman graduated from Princeton University in 1982 with an A.B. in English literature.\n\nPostrel was editor-in-chief of \"Reason\" from July 1989 to January 2000, and remained on the masthead as editor-at-large through 2001. Prior to that, she was a reporter for \"Inc.\" and the \"Wall Street Journal\". She currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). From 2000 to 2006, she wrote an economics column for the \"New York Times\" and from 2006 to 2009 she wrote the \"Commerce and Culture\" column for \"The Atlantic\". She also appeared on the last episode of the third season of Penn and Teller's \"\".\n\nPostrel wrote the biweekly column \"Commerce & Culture\" for the \"Wall Street Journal\" until April 2011. Since May 2011, she has written a biweekly column for \"Bloomberg View\".\n\nShe is best known for her non-fiction books, \"The Future and Its Enemies\" and \"The Substance of Style\". In the former she explains her philosophy, \"dynamism\", a forward-looking and change-seeking philosophy that generally favors unregulated organization through \"spontaneous order\". She contrasts it with \"stasis\", a philosophy that favors top-down control and regulation and is marked by desire to maintain the present state of affairs. In November 2013, she published a third book, \"The Power of Glamour\", which defined glamour as \"nonverbal rhetoric\" that “leads us to feel that the life we dream of exists, and to desire it even more.”\n\nPostrel has written several articles on health care and bioethics, including accounts of her own experiences.\n\nIn March 2006 Postrel donated a kidney to an acquaintance, writer Sally Satel. She has recounted the experience, and referred to it in several subsequent articles and blog posts, many of which are critical of legal prohibitions against compensating organ donors. In some of the pieces, she discusses strategies for working around these restrictions, such as organ donor transplant chains.\n\nIn her March 2009 article \"My Drug Problem\" in \"The Atlantic\", Postrel wrote about her own experience of being treated for breast cancer with the expensive drug Herceptin. She questioned if such a costly treatment would be available to others and if the risky research that makes such innovative treatments possible would be profitable under the proposed health care reforms in the United States.\n\nPostrel has also referred to her experience as a cancer patient in her writing about the importance of design aesthetics in hospitals and the competitive forces that drive them to create more attractive environments for patients. This ties into the thesis of her second book, that beauty is more than simply a superficial, frivolous trait and can go more than skin deep. Notions of beauty and desirability, and thoughts on what makes good design good beyond the needs of sound engineering, inform her work at the \"Deep Glamour\" blog.\n\n\n\n"}

She is signed to WWE under the ring name Zelina Vega, where she performs on the SmackDown brand. She previously worked in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Rosita, and for various independent promotions under her real name. In TNA, she was a one-time Knockouts Tag Team Champion with Sarita.\n\nThea Megan Trinidad was born on December 27, 1990, in Queens, New York. She is of Puerto Rican descent. She grew up watching professional wrestling with her father Michael and younger brother Timothy. Her parents divorced when she and her brother were still young, while still remaining friends. She also practiced swimming and baseball. When Trinidad was ten years old, her father was killed in the September 11 attacks; he had worked as a telecom analyst for the firm Cantor Fitzgerald at the World Trade Center. He was on the 103rd floor of the North Tower when it collapsed. Trinidad's mother, Monique Ferrer, approached StoryCorps with the story of how she and her husband had met and what she experienced on the day of the attacks with his death, which StoryCorps used to create a short cartoon titled \"Always a Family\", as a way of honoring his memory.\n\nTrinidad has said it was because of her father that made her enter the wrestling business. She was featured in an NBC special, titled \"Children of 9/11\", on September 5, 2011. Growing up, Trinidad also worked as a counselor on a camp for children that had lost parents on 9/11 and also participated in charitable causes such as Habitat for Humanity after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans with Tuesday's Children.\n\nAt the age of 17, Trinidad began training under Javi-Air, Azrieal, and T.J. Perkins. Trinidad made her professional wrestling debut under the ring name Divina Fly for National Wrestling Superstars (NWS) on February 20, 2010, in Bloomfield, New Jersey, where she competed against Brittney Savage in a losing effort. On the August 21 NWS event, Fly competed against Niya in a losing effort. On October 1 at an NWS event, Trinidad, now under the ring name Snookie Fly, teamed up with Judas Young and Mike Dennis in a losing effort to Brittney Savage and Team Supreme (Corvis Fear and Nicky Oceans) in a mixed-tag-team match.\n\nOn February 20, 2010, she made her debut for Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU), under the ring name Divina Fly in a losing effort against Brittney Savage. On June 26, 2010, Divina Fly and Niya, collectively known as The Fly Girls, competed for the WSU Tag Team Championships but lost to the reigning champions, Cindy Rogers and Jana. On September 11, 2010, Divina Fly won a match against newcomer Candy Cartwright with a Fly Cutter.\n\nAfter being discovered by Tommy Dreamer, Trinidad wrestled in a tryout dark match at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's (TNA) \"Impact!\" television tapings on January 11, 2011, losing to Angelina Love. On January 27 it was reported that Trinidad had signed a contract with the promotion. On the February 10 episode of \"Impact!\", Trinidad, under the ring name Rosita debuted as the storyline cousin of Sarita in an eight knockout tag team match, where the two of them teamed with Madison Rayne and Tara and defeated Angelina Love, Mickie James, Velvet Sky and Winter, when Rosita pinned Sky. The following week Rosita and Sarita defeated Angelina Love and Velvet Sky in a tag team match to earn a shot at Love's and Winter's TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. On March 13 at Victory Road, Rosita and Sarita defeated Love and Winter to win the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, with Sarita proclaiming that their victory would start a Mexican takeover of TNA. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", the alliance of Rosita, Sarita and Hernandez was named Mexican America. The three of them were then defeated in a six-person street fight by Love, Winter and Matt Morgan. On March 24, the three were joined by Anarquia. In the following weeks Rosita and Sarita successfully defended the Knockouts Tag Team Championship first against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky) and then against Madison Rayne and Tara. They made their third successful defense on the June 16 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", defeating Velvet Sky and Ms. Tessmacher, following outside interference from ODB. Rosita and Sarita lost the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Ms. Tessmacher and Tara on July 12 at the tapings of the July 21 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\". They received a rematch on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, but were defeated by Tessmacher and Tara. On the March 22, 2012, episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Rosita and Sarita again failed to recapture the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, when they were defeated by Eric Young and ODB.\nOn April 19 episode of TNA \"Impact\", Rosita and Sarita teamed up with Madison Rayne and Gail Kim in a losing effort to Brooke Tessmacher, Tara, Velvet Sky and Mickie James. Rosita and Sarita were given another title opportunity on April 15 at Lockdown, but were once again defeated by Eric Young and ODB, this time in a steel cage match. Afterwards, both Rosita and Sarita went inactive from TNA, while Anarquia left the promotion and Hernandez turned face, effectively ending Mexican America. After months of inactivity, it was reported on January 9, 2013, that Trinidad's contract with TNA had expired and she had parted ways with the promotion.
