He took part in the defence of Paris in 1815, and afterwards occupied a subordinate situation in the prefecture of the Seine département. At 25 years of age, he was appointed a knight of the Legion of Honor. \nAbout 1820, he united some of his patriotic friends into a society called \"Amis de la vérité\". \nFrom this, a complete system of Carbonarism developed, whose peculiar principles were introduced from Italy by two of Bazard's friends. \nBazard himself was at the head of the central body, and, while taking a general lead, contributed extensively to the Carbonarist journal, \"L'Aristarque\". \nAn unsuccessful outbreak at Belfort ruined the society, and the leaders were compelled to conceal themselves. Bazard, after remaining for some time in obscurity in Paris, came to the conclusion that the ends of those who wished well to the people would be most easily attained, not through political agitation, but by effecting a radical change in their social condition.\n\nThis train of thinking naturally drew him towards the socialist philosophers of the school of Saint-Simon, whom he joined, he contributed to their journal, \"Le Producteur\"; and in 1828 began to give public lectures on the principles of the school. His opposition to the emancipation of women brought about a quarrel with Enfantin in 1831, and Bazard found himself almost deserted by the members of the society. He attacked Enfantin violently, and, in a heated argument among them, he was struck down by apoplexy. After lingering for a few months, he died.\n"}

It consists in the worship of the \"ngel zex\", the Bai word for \"patrons\" or \"lords\", rendered as \"benzhu\" (本主) in Chinese, that are local gods and deified ancestors of the Bai people. It is very similar to common Chinese religion.\n\nWhile many of the Bai are Buddhists, the local government of China has recently helped the revival of the Benzhu ethnic religion, for example through the promotion of the Gwer Sa La festival.\n\nThe \"benzhu\" are mainly deified ancestors, \"patrons\" or \"lords\" of the local communities. Every Bai village has its own pantheon of gods which has formed throughout its existence, incorporating its history in deifying virtuous leaders, warriors, and heroes. These deities, who are tied to the immediate surroundings, protect the people against sickness and violence, foster local economy, and grant prosperity.\n\nGenerally, one village enshrines one benzhu, and there are also cases of multiple villages consecrated to the same benzhu. In every village around Erhai Lake the local people have developed a peculiar mythology about their local lord, differing from that of neighboring villages. This tradition is similar to that of the City God Temple of Chinese religion.\n\nOther \"benzhu\" are gods of the generation of the local place. These include the God of the Mountain, the God of the Crops, the God of the Hunt, the Dragon King or the Mother Goddess of the Dragon King.\n\nBenzhu Festivals in Dali City take place according to the lunar calendar, after Chinese New Year. During festivals, the benzhu shrine are taken from the temples and carried through the towns to a different location where they stay for a number of days. The villagers follow the gods to the designated place burning incense and worshiping with food and money.\n\nThe Bai believe that the soul does not die with the body, but it can go to the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" helped by complex ritual ceremonies performed by the living community. Angry spirits can cause illness, but local gods can protect people against them. Illnesses are caused by the possession of evil spirits and they can be treated by female shamans.\n\nThe Nama branch of the Bai, residing near the Mekong River, preserves a cult of the white stones common to the ethnic groups descended from the Qiang people. Some believe they represent the bones of the ancestors, others that they are a representation of the Fire God, a deity worshipped around China.\n\n\n\n"}

The figure has become a cultural icon of Dallas and Texas. Since 1952 Big Tex has served as a cultural ambassador to visitors, and the statue's prime location in the fairgrounds serves as a traditional meeting point.\n\nOn October 19, 2012, the last weekend of the 2012 State Fair of Texas, Big Tex was destroyed by an electrical fire that started in the right boot and worked its way up the structure, first becoming visible from the neck area.\nAfter the fire, a new Big Tex was created by SRO Associates and Texas Scenic Co. This rendition made its first public appearance on September 26, 2013.\n\nKerens, Texas is known as the \"Birthplace of Big Tex\", although his original incarnation was as a 49-foot (15 m) tall Santa Claus constructed from iron drill casing, papier mache, and unraveled rope in 1949. The statue was an idea of Howell Brister, manager of the Chamber of Commerce, to encourage holiday sales in the town, and the \"World's Largest Santa Claus\" (a claim later disputed) stood over Colket Avenue for two holiday seasons — drawing press attention from as far away as Iran and Australia. Modeled after Kerens residents Ottis Franklin Spurlock and Hardy Mayo, the figure was built by members of the community who welded the frame, fabricated the body and sewed the clothing.\n\nAfter two seasons the excitement over the statue faded, and Kerens offered it up for sale. In 1951, State Fair president R. L. Thornton purchased Santa's components for $750 and had artist Jack Bridges transform them into a cowboy, giving birth to \"Big Tex\".\n\nBig Tex made his debut at the 1952 fair, a 52-foot cowboy dressed in denim jeans and a plaid shirt donated by the H. D. Lee Company of Shawnee Mission, Kansas. Artist Jack Bridges used a photograph of his own face, a photograph of rancher Doc Simmons and a photograph of Will Rogers to create the new look. After the fair, his appearance was slightly altered to straighten his nose and correct an odd wink. It was in 1953 that Big Tex also began speaking. Using a custom-built recipromotor and a 75-watt speaker system housed in the figure's head, Jack Bridges devised a way to create the illusion of natural speech with a swinging jaw. Tex also attended a convention in Minneapolis that year with the Dallas Jaycees.\n\nIn 1955 Big Tex received his first new change of clothes, again fabricated by the H. D. Lee Company. After that year's fair, he traveled to West Texas to participate in Abilene Christian College's 50th annual homecoming celebration. A 12-foot-tall, 19-foot long plastic model of a Hereford steer (called \"The Champ\") accompanied Big Tex for the 1956 fair, but Big Tex was primarily displayed alone. During the 1950s Big Tex underwent further re-design, replacing the papier mache \"skin\" with fiberglass. The original head was put into storage and later sold at auction in 1993 to a Dallas collector.\n\nThe State Fair of Texas announced the construction of a permanent, year-round statue of Big Tex in 1961, but the figure remained a seasonal feature appearing only during the fair. Instead, the Big Tex Circle display area was redesigned in 1966 with a larger mound.\n\nBig Tex traveled to his hometown of Kerens, Texas in 1981 to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the city. The figure continued to travel to various promotional events until the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1997, Big Tex was given a skeletal makeover consisting of 4,200 feet of steel rods weighing 6,000 pounds. The new skeleton adjusted the posture and allowed for a new hand that waved to passersby, but kept the original head. Three years later his neck was animated, allowing it to turn; his mechanical mouth was also upgraded with a new system.\n\nBig Tex celebrated his 50th birthday in 2002, receiving a giant birthday cake and an AARP card. Shades of gray were added to the hair and wrinkles were added the figure's hands and face as Big Tex continued to \"age\". In 2012 the State Fair of Texas celebrated Big Tex's 60th birthday.\n\nOn the morning of October 19, 2012 (the final weekend of the 2012 State Fair of Texas, and on Big Tex's 60th birthday) a fire started inside the framework of Big Tex. The figure's clothing, face and hat were completely destroyed in minutes as onlookers watched. An official investigation determined that the fire started in an electrical panel (fixed wiring) under the attraction's right boot. This panel was believed to have powered the air compressor that kept the clothing of the statue 'inflated'.\n\nNews of the fire received national attention, and fair officials committed to rebuilding Big Tex \"bigger and better\" in time for the 2013 fair.\n\nWorking under secrecy, a new Big Tex was created during 2013 by SRO Associates and Texas Scenic Co. at a cost of $500,000. The recreated statue weighs more than the previous version, bringing him to . This allows Big Tex to withstand winds without needing support wires as in previous versions. The height was increased by to tall. Big Tex Circle, the location during the State Fair of Texas, was also enlarged and reinforced for the larger statue.\n\nBig Tex generally receives a new shirt and jeans every 3 seasons, currently designed and fabricated by the Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Company. His clothing will next be replaced in 2019.\n\nPrior to 2013, Big Tex wore size 70 boots, a 75-gallon hat, a size 100 180/181 shirt made from nylon awning fabric and 284W/185L XXXXXL pair of Dickies jeans. The pants alone required of denim and weigh in at . Over the years the outfit was accessorized with other articles associated with that year's State Fair of Texas theme. Big Tex has suffered a few garment mishaps over the years. In 1961, Hurricane Carla's winds tore his clothes. In 1970, his huge shirt was stolen from a pickup truck and received much publicity.\n\nThe recreated structure for Big Tex that appeared in 2013 required new clothing and larger sizes. The new Dickie shirt features a 14-foot collar, 23 foot sleeves and weighs . The shirt is made from of awning material. The new Dickie jeans features a 27-foot waist, 22 foot inseam and weighs . The jeans are made from of denim material.\n\nBig Tex welcomes fairgoers with his friendly drawl of \"Hoooowdeeee, fooolllllks!\" and makes regular announcements throughout the duration of the State Fair of Texas. His booming voice has been played by only a few men over six decades, who perform every day of the fair from a booth known as the \"doghouse\".\n\nAl Jones, a disc jockey for WRR FM 101.1, was the first voice of Big Tex. Al spoke for Big Tex for three years. Radio announcer Jim Lowe, the most well-known voice of Big Tex, performed for 39 continuous years until 1998. Dan Alexander stepped up for the next two years. In 2001 a statewide competition and contest, held live at the Cotton Bowl, announced Sonny Ray Stolz as the next voice of Big Tex. But after only one season Sonny decided not to continue due to what he considered unprofessional treatment by Fair officials and the Fair brought in runner-up Bill Bragg in 2002. After the 2012 State Fair, the Fair chose not to renew Bill Bragg's contract and instead hired Dan Alexander for Big Tex, who is believed to be the new voice of Big Tex, whose contract was renewed.\n\nThe voice of the 1955 Big Tex can be heard on the recording of NBC's live Wide Wide World which includes multiple segments at the State Fair.\n\n\n"}

Immediately sending for reinforcements from Ballina, Castlebar and Swinford, a force of 200 redcoats were sent after Gallagher and, upon their arrival, proceeded to surround the home where the highwayman had been staying. Gallagher, by then in poor health and not wishing to endanger his host or his family, surrendered to the British. Taken back to Foxford, he was tried and convicted before being taken to Castlebar where he was executed.\n\nShortly before his execution, he had claimed to the British commanding officer that his treasure had been hidden under a rock in the woods of Barnalyra. After Gallagher's execution, the officer quickly led several cavalryman to Barnalyra who discovered there were thousands of rocks in the wood, upon a long search of all the rocks within the area, they reportedly only recovered a jewel hilted sword. It has been speculated that Gallagher may have been hoping to lead them to the site in the hopes his men would be able to rescue him from their hideout near the Derryronane-Curryane border although the treasure, if he owned more than the sword, was never recovered.\n\nCaptain Rock\n\n"}

Anno is also a vegetarian.\n\nAnno began his career after attending Osaka University of Arts as an animator for the anime series \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" (1982–1983). Wrapped up in producing the DAICON III and IV Opening Animations with his fellow students, he was eventually expelled from Osaka.\n\nAnno did not gain recognition until the release of his work on Hayao Miyazaki's 1984 film \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\". Running short on animators, the film's production studio posted an ad in the famous Japanese animation magazine Animage, announcing that they were in desperate need of more animators. Anno, in his early twenties at the time, read the ad and headed down to the film's studio, where he met with Miyazaki and showed him some of his drawings. Impressed with his ability, Miyazaki hired him to draw some of the most complicated scenes near the end of the movie, and valued his work highly.\n\nAnno went on to become one of the co-founders of Gainax in December 1984. He worked as an animation director for their first feature-length film, \"\" (1987), and ultimately became Gainax's premiere anime director, leading the majority of the studio's projects such as \"Gunbuster\" (1988) and \"\" (1990–1991). However, Anno fell into a four-year depression following \"Nadia\" — the series was handed down to him from NHK from an original concept by Hayao Miyazaki (of which \"Castle in the Sky\" is also partly based upon) and he was given little creative control.\n\nIn 1994, the minor planet 9081 Hideakianno was named after him by his old friend Akimasa Nakamura.\n\nAnno's next project was the anime television series (1995–1996), which would be touted as an influential animated series.\n\nAnno's history of clinical depression was the main source for many of the psychological elements of the series and its characters, as he wrote down on paper several of the trials and tribulations of his condition. During the show's production, Anno became disenchanted with the Japanese \"otaku\" lifestyle. For this and other reasons (although perhaps by design as well), \"Evangelion\"s plot became increasingly dark and psychological as the series progressed, despite being broadcast in a children's television timeslot. Anno felt that people should be exposed to the realities of life at as young an age as possible, and by the end of the series all attempts at traditional narrative logic were abandoned, with the final two episodes taking place within the main character's mind.\n\nThe show did not garner high ratings in Japan at its initial time slot, but after being moved to a later, more adult-oriented venue, it gained considerable popularity. Budgeting issues at Gainax also forced Anno to replace the planned ending of \"Evangelion\" with two episodes set in the main characters' minds. After these last two episodes were aired, Anno received numerous letters and emails from fans, both congratulating him on the series and criticizing the last two episodes. Among these were death threats and letters of disappointment from fans who thought Anno had ruined the series for them. In 1997, Gainax launched a project to re-adapt \"Evangelion\"s scrapped ending into a feature-length film. Once again, budgeting issues left the film unfinished, and the completed 27 minutes of animation were included as the second act of \"\". Eventually, the project culminated in \"The End of Evangelion\", a three-act film that served as a finale to \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\".\n\nIn September 1999, Anno appeared on the NHK TV-documentary \"Welcome Back for an Extracurricular Lesson, Senpai!\", answering some \"Evangelion\"-related questions, including the origin of the name \"Evangelion\", and teaching children about animation production.\n\nOn April 15, 2015, Anno spoke about his feelings regarding Asuka and Rei. He claimed:\n\"The truth is, I have no emotional attachment to Rei at all. \nIn the midst of making Eva, I suddenly realized that I had forgotten her. Her very existence. For example, in episode seven, I remembered and added one shot with Rei. I had no attachment to her at all. I think that was okay, because in episode eight, she didn't appear. Not even in a single shot.\"\n\nAfter \"Evangelion\", Anno directed the 1998 anime series \"Kareshi Kanojo no Jijō\" (\"Kare Kano\" for short, also known in English as \"His and Her Circumstances\"), the first Gainax television series to be directly adapted from previously-written material. During the production of \"Kare Kano\", Anno became frustrated with the restrictions placed on the show by TV Tokyo after the Pokémon seizure incident and has not directed television anime since then.\n\nThe director has also made forays into live-action films, beginning with \"Love & Pop\" (1998), a cinéma vérité-style film about enjo kosai (\"compensated dating\", a form of teenage prostitution) in Japan, of which a major portion was shot on miniature digital cameras with constantly shifting aspect ratios. He won Best New Director Award at 1998 Yokohama Film Festival for the film. Asumi Miwa who played the lead role won Best New Talent award respectively. His second live-action film, \"Shiki-Jitsu\" (2000) (\"Ritual Day\" or \"Ceremonial Day\"), is the story of a burnt-out former animation director (played by popular indie director Shunji Iwai) who falls in love with a woman disconnected from reality. Though an experimental work like \"Love & Pop\", this film was shot using the more traditional aspect ratio and has a generally more polished presentation, eschewing the cinéma vérité grittiness of Anno's first live-action film. This movie earned him Best Artistic Contribution Award at Tokyo International Film Festival and very positive reviews.\n\nAnno's third live-action film was \"Cutie Honey\", based on Go Nagai's 1973 manga and anime series. Released in the summer of 2004, this lighthearted fantasy/superhero film was a stark contrast to his earlier, more realist live-action works. Later in 2004, Anno supervised but did not direct the three-part OVA, \"\", instead directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi (part 1), Takamichi Itō (part 2), and Masayuki (part 3).\n\nAlso released in 2004 was the movie , in which Anno makes several acting cameos: as the student in the front row of the \"Home Room!\" skit sitting next to Hataru, in \"Who's the Director?\" as an animator who feels he is being overworked, and finally in \"Singles Picnic\" he is among the men awaiting females who never come.\n\nOn August 1, 2006, Hideaki Anno's official website was updated with job listings for key animators and production staff at a company he founded, Studio Khara. In September 2006, it is reported by the October edition of the Japanese animation magazine \"Newtype\". On September 9, 2006, GAINAX's official website confirmed that \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" was in the works. The first three movies would be an alternate retelling of the TV series (including many new scenes, settings, backgrounds, characters), and the fourth movie would be a completely new conclusion to the story. Kazuya Tsurumaki and Masayuki would direct the movies while Yoshiyuki Sadamoto would provide character designs and Ikuto Yamashita would provide mechanical designs. Shinji Higuchi would provide storyboards for the first movie. The first was launched in Summer 2007, and the second and third were planned to be launched in 2008, however, the second installment was released by itself on June 27, 2009. The third movie was to be released simultaneously with the fourth, instead, the third movie was released on November 17, 2012 and a release date for the fourth movie has yet to be announced. On February 17, 2007, Anno published an official statement on the Japanese Yahoo Portal for the films regarding his personal involvement and goals in their production.\n\nIn October 2007, Hideaki Anno resigned from Gainax. In 2011 Anno co-produced the Koinobori Pictures movie \"Kantoku Shikkaku\" (\"Failed Director\"), directed by Katsuyuki Hirano featuring Yumika Hayashi.\n\nIn 2012, Anno was the curator of an exhibit entitled \"Tokusatsu- Special Effects Museum-Craftsmanship of Showa and Heisei Eras Seen Through Miniatures\", held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, featuring actual props and suits from many of Japan's tokusatsu films and TV shows. Anno also produced a short live-action film for the exhibit, entitled \"A Giant Warrior Descends on Tokyo\", featuring the Giant Warrior-God from Studio Ghibli’s animated film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.\n\nAnno has gone on to work with Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli on several short films which have been shown at the Ghibli Museum. He also voiced the main character Jiro Horikoshi in Miyazaki's 2013 feature film \"The Wind Rises\".\n\nAnno designed the \"\" sci-fi anime television series opening sequence. In 2014, Anno and Studio Khara launched \"Japan Animator Expo\", a series of original net animations made by various directors.\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that Anno would team up with close friend and Gainax cofounder Shinji Higuchi to write and codirect \"Shin Godzilla\", the 2016 reboot of Toho's Godzilla franchise.\n\nAnno has appeared in manga twice, both created by personal acquaintances. His wife, Moyoko Anno, wrote \"Insufficient Direction\", a chronicle of their courtship and marriage and depicting Anno's \"true face\" as \"the founder of the otaku cult\". In 2007, a college-age version of him appeared alongside other Gainax founders Hiroyuki Yamaga, Takami Akai, and Toshio Okada in the Kazuhiko Shimamoto manga \"Aoi Honō\". Anno attended Osaka University of Arts with Shimamoto. \"Aoi Honō\" was adapted into a live action television drama in 2014, where Anno was played by actor Ken Yasuda. The 2014 animated series Shirobako has a walk-on appearance by a character named \"Mitsuaki Kanno\", who is an obvious caricature of Anno.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40424284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40424284", "title": "Jim Ranchino", "text": "Jim Ranchino\n\nJames Lewis Ranchino (; April 20, 1936 - November 7, 1978), known as Jim Ranchino, was a pollster, political consultant, and political scientist on the faculty of Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. He died of a massive heart attack while awaiting to appear on Little Rock ABC television station KATV on the night of the 1978 general election.\n\nRanchino was a strong supporter of his fellow Democrat, future U.S. President Bill Clinton, who that night easily defeated the Republican Lynn Lowe to win the first of five non-consecutive terms as governor of Arkansas.\n\nRanchino was one of five children born in Herrin in Williamson County in southern Illinois to Angelo \"Comp\" Ranchino (1908-1988) and the former Esther Verna. His siblings were three sisters, Alma Joy Hise (1928-2010) of Herrin, Mariann R. Hunt (1933-2010), of Des Moines, Iowa, and Cheryl Ranchino Trench, a newspaper columnist in Herrin, and a brother, John Edward Ranchino, who died in infancy. Ranchino and his wife, Veda, had two children, Tony A. Ranchino (born 1969), a photojournalist for KATV in Little Rock, where his father collapsed, and Nicole \"Niki\" R. Jackson (born 1971), who was seven at the time of her father's death and operates a children's camp. After her husband's early death, Veda continued to live in Clark County and the next year married local prosecuting attorney Henry Morgan.\n\nRanchino graduated from Herrin High School in 1954. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Louisiana College in 1961. In 1963 or 1964, he received his Master of Arts in history from Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas; his thesis is entitled \"The Work and Thought of a Jeffersonian in the Populist Movement: James Harvey 'Cyclone' Davis\" and is a study of the Populist organizer and Democratic U.S. Representative James \"Cyclone\" Davis of Texas. He studied graduate political science, and also history under the historian William Appleman Williams, during his time at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where he was from 1963 to 1965. Ranchino was described as a \"campus radical\".\n\nAt Ouachita Baptist University, where he started in 1965, his teaching colleagues included two other Arkansas political figures, Bob C. Riley, the lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1975, and the Clinton friend and Whitewater associate James B. Dougal, who subsequently ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1982 against the late Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt in Arkansas' 3rd congressional district. Coincidentally, Clinton himself had lost the 1974 congressional race to Hammerschmidt. A Ranchino student recalls that the professor demanded original thinking by his students and sometimes gave false information in a lecture to test the alertness and preparation of the class. Ranchino was the director of the OBU Volunteers in Service to America program, the first of its kind established in 1968 in Arkansas. Forty-eight students signed up initially as volunteers. In 1969, the program was co-sponsored by OBU and the Arkansas Council on Human Relations and described at the time as the largest of its kind in the nation.\n\nL. T. Simes, II, an African American student at OBU who in 1970 was elected vice president of the student body, recalls Ranchino as a:\n\nvisionary. I will never forget the conversation we had about political polling. He could foresee the art of polling as early as 1970. He allowed me to challenge him on this point. I didn’t believe that it was possible to predict voter behavior in that there were so many variables. Dr. Ranchino was right. Now polling is a basic component of our electoral process. Most memorable was the time he invited me to come to his office the following day to meet ... this man dressed like a hippie, long hair, etc. Dr. Ranchino said to me, L. T., I want to introduce you to Bill Clinton. He became governor of Arkansas and later President of the United States. Times passes on ... While in law school I again met Bill Clinton as my law professor. ...\n\nIn the 1968 general election, Arkansas was declared \"schizophrenic\" by political observers for having cast its electoral votes for George Wallace, its gubernatorial majority for Moderate Republican Winthrop Rockefeller, and its U.S. Senate ballots for J. William Fulbright. As a result, Ranchino in 1972 published the book \"From Faubus to Bumpers: Arkansas Votes, 1960-1970,\" a political analysis of state election during the preceding decade. In the study he concludes that Arkansas voters are flexible and independent and can make consistent ballot choices even if they appear inconsistent.\n\nRanchino estimated the 1970 Arkansas electorate as 150,000 conservatives, 150,000 liberals, and 300,000 moderates. In his own words, Ranchino offers this analysis from 1970 which has been rendered obsolete by the development of political events in the 21st century:\n\nRepublicans have never had a party in Arkansas in the strictest sense. They have not offered consistent opposition to the Democrats at all levels of government and have frequently opted out for individual efforts and campaigns at the expense of the broad party-oriented effort.<br>\n\n...Whichever way the moderate vote leans in any specific election does make the essential difference between victory or defeat for the candidates. ... There is \"no emerging Republican majority\" (a term coined in 1969 by Kevin P. Phillips) in Arkansas built on a coalition of blue-collar, middle-class Democrats and upper-class traditional Republicans. The success that Republicans have had in Arkansas has come from a moderate liberal coalition based on blacks and progressive Democrats. That combination was shattered in 1970. ...\n\nIn 1976, Ranchino attributed the Democratic presidential nomination of former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia to Carter's young pollster, Patrick Caddell, who advised the candidate to accent the \"trust factor,\" rather than highlighting various temporary campaign issues. Ranchino called his fellow pollster Caddell \"the best in the country.\"\n\nIn September 1977, the cover of the \"Arkansas Times\" magazine carried an article by Ranchino, \"The Arkansas of the '70s: The Good Ole Boy Ain't Whut He Used to Be\", which reflects on the increasing use of marijuana, pre-marital sexual relations, and unfaithfulness to marriage vows \"becoming more the rule than the exception\". The article was published at the height of Anita Bryant's \"Save the Children\" campaign against homosexual rights in Miami, Florida. Ranchino wrote that many in Arkansas had by the late 1970s already been viewing the decline of family values with growing anxiety.\n\nRanchino had no inclination of his sudden death. He had done election commentary for KATV since 1972. He leased a private plane to take him out of state as soon as his assignment for KATV had been completed. Ranchino had worked as a pollster on a campaign and wanted to be there for the final counting of the votes. Claudia Riley, widow of Lieutenant Governor Bob Riley, whose home in Arkadelphia had been a meeting place for many of the state's rising Democratic politicians, called Ranchino prior to his death \"a bright star on the horizon.\"\n\nRanchino's funeral services were held at the First Baptist Church of Arkadelphia. He is interred at Rest Haven Memorial Gardens in Arkadelphia.\n\nVeda Ranchino Morgan still operates Ranchino Research, Inc. She was a donor to Hillary Clinton in the latter's 2008 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama.\n\nOuachita Baptist University has among scores of scholarships one named in Ranchino's honor.\n"}

Founded Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art, in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions. Friend and intimate (and sometime benefactor) to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war era, such as Patrick Kavanagh and Brendan Behan; Ryan's memoirs, \"Remembering How We Stood\", evoke literary Dublin of the period 1945-55. Involved in numerous literary events and happenings and, with Brian O'Nolan, organised the first Bloomsday.\n\nJohn Ryan attended Clongowes Wood College and the National College of Art and Design (NCAD), Dublin. One of the eight children of Séamus Ryan, a member of Seanad Éireann, and his wife Agnes Ryan née Harding who came from Kilfeacle and Solohead respectively in County Tipperary and who were Republican activists during the Irish War of Independence. His mother was a patron of the painter Jack Yeats, amongst others. His sister was the actress Kathleen Ryan. Several of Ryan's children followed him into the arts: son and namesake John Ryan (journalist, publisher and actor); Seamus Ryan (photographer); Anna Livia Ryan (actress).\n\nJohn Ryan studied at the NCAD, but was largely a self-taught painter through a practice of 'careful intelligent observation' combined with 'a genuine and humorous love of land, sea and human tradition' (Hilary Pyle, 'John Ryan exhibition in Cork', The Irish Times, 23 October 1981). He was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) from 1946 onwards, and also showed at the annual Oireachtas and the Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA). Designed theatre sets for the Abbey, Gate, Olympia and Gaiety Theatres as well as for the stage in London. He also acted in and produced several plays.\n\nIn response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions founded \"Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art\" (1949–1951), and was editor of \"The Dublin Magazine\" from 1970–75. As a writer and critic he contributed to literary magazines and newspapers. Publishing two memoirs, \"Remembering How We Stood\", a memoir of post-war literary Dublin, and \"A Wave of the Sea\" (Ward River, 1981), a marine memoir. A broadcaster from the early 1950s he became a long-time contributor to Sunday Miscellany on Radio Éireann (RTÉ Radio). Purchased The Bailey pub in 1957 which became a famous literary venue frequented by characters such as Kavanagh, O'Nolan, et al. A friend and intimate to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war period, such as Behan, Anthony Cronin, Patrick Swift, Seán O'Sullivan, Pearse Hutchinson, J. P. Donleavy and Brian O'Nolan, et al., he was also a benefactor to some of these artists, particularly Patrick Kavanagh. During the war years he very cheaply rented a space above the family's Monument Creameries store (now a Burger King) on Grafton Street to sculptor Desmond MacNamara, and which became the site for a famous bohemian salon attended by all of the foregoing names and many more.\n\nRyan was an important early champion of James Joyce's work in Ireland at a time when Joyce was largely ignored in his homeland: with Brian O'Nolan he organised the first Bloomsday celebration; in 1951 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce he published a special number of \"Envoy\" dedicated to Joyce \"which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countryman towards their illustrious compatriot\" (Envoy, Vol. 5, No. 17, April 1951), inviting Brian O'Nolan to be guest editor; edited \"A Bash in the Tunnel\": James Joyce by the Irish, Patrick Kavanagh, Brian O'Nolan, Samuel Beckett, Ulick O'Connor, Edna O'Brien (Brighton: Clifton Books 1970); saved Leopold Bloom's front door to 7 Eccles Street from demolition and used it in The Bailey pub in St. Anne Street, Dublin, from whence it was removed and transported to the Joyce Museum on N. Gt. George's St., Oct. 1995; arranged that the James Joyce Tower become a museum; Secretary of the James Joyce Society of Ireland 1970–74.\n\nDecember 1949– July 1951. Founded and edited by Ryan.\nEnvoy was inaugurated in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions which had forced many writers to seek publication outside their homeland.\nDuring its brief existence, \"Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art\", published the work of a broad range of writers, Irish and others. The first to publish J. P. Donleavy, Brendan Behan's first short stories and his first poem, and an extract from Samuel Beckett's Watt. Envoy included Patrick Kavanagh's infamous monthly \"Diary\". Brian O'Nolan was another substantial contributor and was \"honorary editor\" for the special number commemorating James Joyce.\n\nAn affectionate account of Bohemian Dublin in the 1950s with Behan, Kavanagh, J. P. Donleavy (q.v.), Anthony Cronin and other Dublin characters. Ryan:\n\nFrom the foreword by J. P. Donleavy:\nAs one reads his words, dressed in their wonderful finery of irony, the world he speaks of reblossoms to be back again awhile. To see, feel and smell the Dublin of that day... a masterpiece of reminiscence.\n\nBLOOMSDAY (a term Joyce himself did not employ) was invented in 1954, the 50th anniversary, when John Ryan and the novelist Flann O'Brien organised what was to be a daylong pilgrimage along the Ulysses route. They were joined by Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Tom Joyce (a dentist who, as Joyce's cousin, represented the family interest) and AJ Leventhal (Registrar of Trinity College). Ryan had engaged two horse drawn cabs, of the old-fashioned kind, which in Ulysses Mr. Bloom and his friends drive to poor Paddy Dignam's funeral. The party were assigned roles from the novel. They planned to travel round the city through the day, visiting in turn the scenes of the novel, ending at night in what had once been the brothel quarter of the city, the area which Joyce had called Nighttown. The pilgrimage was abandoned halfway through, when the weary pilgrims succumbed to inebriation and rancour at the Bailey pub in the city centre, which Ryan then owned, and at which, in 1967, he installed the door to No. 7 Eccles Street (Leopold Bloom's front door) having rescued it from demolition . A Bloomsday record of 1954, informally filmed by John Ryan, follows this pilgrimage.\n\nWhenever you mention Patrick Kavanagh’s seat on the Grand Canal Dublin, most people will immediately think of the more famous park bench with the statue of Paddy himself sitting to one side of the seat almost beckoning for someone to sit down beside him. This bench is situated on the north bank of the Grand Canal between Baggot Street Bridge and the upstream Eustace Bridge. John Coll produced the sculpture and the seat was unveiled by President Mary Robinson on 11 June 1991, however this is not the original seat.\nOnly a relatively few people will be aware of the lesser known original Kavanagh seat situated on the South Bank at the Lock Gates close to Baggot Street Bridge. As is well known from his poem and heavy hints to his friends, he wished to be commemorated with a simple canal side seat near the lock gates of Baggot Street Bridge. To this effect shortly after his death in 1967, a committee was formed by the late John Ryan and Denis Dwyer to collect a sum of money to purchase the materials and labour for the seat. The seat was erected in the poet's memory by his friends in 1968.\n\nWriter\n\nEditor / publisher\n\nRelating to\n\n"}

Smith remained with the woman, in a lit room, for an hour after the rape, while he smoked a cigarette and she smoked two. He told her that his name was Johnny Briscoe. After the rapist left the scene the victim called police. While police were still on the scene, Smith called the victim's apartment repeatedly, again identifying himself as Johnny Briscoe. These calls were traced back to a payphone near Briscoe's apartment. The woman identified Briscoe in both a photo and in a live police lineup in which Briscoe was the only person in an orange jumpsuit.\n\nAt the trial, a forensic hair examiner declared that a piece of hair found on the victim's bed was similar to Briscoe's hair. Briscoe's attorney used an alibi defence, stating that Briscoe was at his apartment, watching Game 7 of the 1982 World Series (in which the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers). In the court room, Briscoe responded to a question and said that the Brewers won the World Series, making the alibi incredible. The jury took less than 2 hours to convict Briscoe of all the charges: rape, sodomy, burglary, robbery, stealing and armed criminal action. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.\n\nBriscoe spent five months in a cell adjacent to Larry Smith whom he confronted and accused of framing him. Smith denied the allegation. Briscoe's wife divorced him 10 years into the sentence.\n\nBriscoe requested that evidence from the crime scene be tested for DNA but the St. Louis District Attorney refused. In 1997 Briscoe's motion to compel the District Attorney to search for DNA evidence was rejected.\n\nIn 2000, Centurion Ministries took the case, and, that year and again in 2001, requested that the St. Louis Crime Laboratory search for DNA evidence. The Lab responded that the evidence collected could not be found and was probably destroyed.\n\nIn 2004, however, the cigarettes from the crime scene were found in an inventory, but the district attorney was not informed until July 6, 2006. Testing proved that Larry Smith was the criminal, not Briscoe, and Briscoe was freed on July 19.\n\nBriscoe's exoneration was widely covered in national news. It is taking some time for him to convince his family of his innocence, and for him to get a full-time job. He is suing St. Louis County and four police officers to compensate him for his time spent in prison.\n\n"}

Susan Brown (born 1959) is a Canadian anarchist communist writer and theoretician.\n\nBrown is best known for her book \"The Politics of Individualism\" (1993) and for her article \"Does Work Really Work?\". In \"The Politics of Individualism\", she makes a distinction between \"existential individualism\" and \"instrumental individualism\" and examines how these forms are utilized in liberalism (particularly liberal feminism) and anarchism. She argues for a new vision of human freedom which incorporates the insights of feminism and liberalism into a form of anarchism based on what she calls \"existential individualism\". The work focuses specifically on the similarities and differences of these political philosophies, by critically examining the liberal feminist writings of John Stuart Mill, Betty Friedan, Simone de Beauvoir and Janet Radcliffe Richards, especially focusing on the issues of employment, education, marriage and the family, and governmental politics. These works are, in turn, compared to the anarcha-feminism of Emma Goldman.\n\nIn both \"The Politics of Individualism\" and \"Does Work Really Work?\", Brown's conception of libertarian socialism is that all social bonds should be developed by individuals who have an \"equal\" amount of bargaining power, because, in Brown's view, an accumulation of monetary wealth leads to the centralization of economic and political power in the hands of a small elite, reducing the bargaining power—and thus the liberty—of the other individuals in society. She provides an in-depth analysis of why, in her view, the wage labor system is inherently corrupt and unreformable and why it must be abolished and replaced with a system in which people would be completely free to choose to perform (or not to perform) voluntary activities, a system that would, in Brown's view, encourage people to be creative and self-directed, that would celebrate enjoyment and fulfillment.\n\nBrown has published many articles on the political philosophy of anarchism and feminism, and has had her work translated into Dutch, French, German and Finnish.\n\nBrown works and lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and holds a PhD from the University of Toronto.\n\n\n"}

Historically was used to refer mostly to ethnic Lithuanians, sometimes to citizens of Grand Duchy of Lithuania of other nations. According to the Statutes of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was populated with Litvins, Rusyns, and Zmuds (Samogitians) and therefore the full name for the state was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia.\n\nThe ethnographic or cultural studies about the ethnic group are poorly noted and are traced to the beginning of 18th century. The poet-monk Klymentiy Zinoviyiv who published several works about cultural studies noted that Litvins, perhaps after the older pagan tradition worked on Sundays and rested on Fridays. More notes about Litvins were provided at the end of 18th century by historians of the Russian Empire Afanasiy (Opanas) Shafonsky and Yakov Markovych. According to Markovych, Litvins are a special regional group such as Gascoigne in France or Swabians in Germany.\n\nThe name Litvin (Litvyak) owes its origin to political and state factors and is a demonym (politonym) with reference to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nSelf name of Litvins in Chernihiv region (Chernihiv Oblast) is Ruski, but not Moskals or Katsaps. The name of Litvins among them is accepted as derogative.\n\nIn modern Belarus the word is widely used to describe only Grand Duchy of Lithuania citizens speaking Slavic languages (Ruthenian or Polish), predominantly of Catholic faith and Lithuanian origin or who strongly associated themselves with the state of Lithuania identifying themselves with the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, this idea is not accepted by the scientific community.\n\nThe term may specifically refer to people speaking Belarusian in historical contexts. In other contexts, it can also refer to Slavic people identifying themselves with the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania in present-day Lithuania and Belarus, as well in Ukraine, western Russia and parts of Poland. In modern Belarus, the term is used by some to stress Belarusian participation and contributions to the former Grand Duchy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7271220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7271220", "title": "Matt Parkman", "text": "Matt Parkman\n\nMatthew \"Matt\" Parkman, Sr., is a fictional character of the NBC science fiction serial drama \"Heroes\", played by Greg Grunberg. Matt is a police officer, who works for the LAPD and NYPD in Seasons One and Two respectively. He is a telepath; his ability allows him to read minds, and eventually extends into aspects of mind control, as stated by Bob Bishop.\n\nMatt Parkman is a police officer with the LAPD. He tried to become a detective, but had flunked the exam three times due to dyslexia. Parkman is a mind-reader; he can hear the thoughts of people around him. He first realizes this after hearing the thoughts of Molly Walker, a girl who was hiding from a serial killer named Sylar.\n\nHe is nearly arrested by his FBI partner, but then is able to later prove his ability to read thoughts. He is then offered a position in the investigation. Things turn dangerous when a man who appears to be Sylar shows up. Stopping the man from harming Molly, Matt tries to comfort her while Audrey, the FBI agent, gives chase. Ultimately, the man escapes, but not before displaying apparent telekinesis and standing after being shot. Later, Matt comes home to his wife, Janice.\n\nMatt escapes to a bar after a heated argument with his wife and hears the thoughts of the various patrons. However, when he encounters a patron, a tall silent black man, whose mind he cannot read, the other voices fade out. The man sits and stares at Matt until Matt falls unconscious.\n\nMatt wakes up strapped to a table with Mr. Bennet standing over him. Bennet explains that they had to drug him, and that he works for a secret company. Matt tries to read Bennet's mind, but is unable due to The Haitian, who was the man at the bar. Matt is still able to discern the name of Bennet's daughter, Claire, impressing Bennet with his developing power. The Haitian then wipes Matt's memories of being drugged and abducted by Bennet.\n\nMatt wakes up a day later, suffering from what he thinks is a hangover. His wife Janice tells him he has been missing and was worried. He uses his ability to listen to her thoughts and give her everything she wants, healing the rift between the two of them.\n\nThe following day at work, Matt and his partner at the FBI run down a possible lead on Sylar after discovering a charred corpse with a fingerprint. Instead of Sylar, they find a man with radioactive powers. In a stand off, Matt defuses the situation by allowing the man to speak with his comatose wife. At the end of the day, Matt is informed by his old partner that he was being given another chance to apply for a detective position. Matt happens to read the man's mind, discovering that he is sleeping with Janice. Matt punches his former partner and is consequently suspended.\n\nUnaware of this, Audrey asks Matt for assistance in interviewing Ted Sprague, the man who radiates nuclear power. Matt talks with him and discovers that, like himself, Ted was abducted from a bar after seeing the Haitian and woke up later with amnesia. He further discovers similar marks on their necks. Then, Homeland Security takes Ted into custody before Matt can learn more, but Ted tells Matt to \"find the Haitian.\" Audrey later notifies Matt that Ted has escaped. Matt and Audrey then investigate a crime scene at Union Wells High in Odessa, Texas, where they suspect Sylar was intercepted by two people nearby. They don't consider Peter Petrelli a suspect in Jackie's death, but interrogate him and learn that Sylar's target was the cheerleader Claire Bennet.\n\nMatt later attempts to read Claire's mind when she is being interviewed. However, he is unable to hear anything except static, which also happened to him before he was abducted. Suspicious, he and Audrey stake out Primatech Paper and Matt recognizes The Haitian. He attempts to overhear Mr. Bennet or the Haitian's thoughts and is able to pick up just one word: \"Sylar.\"\n\nFor the next two weeks, Matt keeps a close watch on Primatech Paper, but he is seen on cameras. Finally, in \"Godsend,\" Matt and Audrey organize a raid of Primatech. When they find nothing, their boss is very upset and threatens to fire Audrey. Fearful of losing her job, she tells Matt their partnership is over. Matt confronts Bennet, telling him he knows he was kidnapped and will make Bennet pay.\n\nMatt faces a review board that questions his details of the past few weeks. They find his references to a \"super-powered serial killer\" almost insane. Matt recants his statement after hearing it will save his job. However, Matt is suspended for six months. At home, Matt takes a job as a bodyguard for money. His assignment is Aron Malsky, a man who stole $2 million from Linderman as restitution. Upon learning the jeweler is on Linderman's payroll, they try to run, but Jessica comes to kill Aron for Linderman. After a fight, Jessica throws Matt out of a window and onto a sign girder before proceeding to tear Aron in half. Malsky had hidden diamonds in the ceiling shortly before he died. Matt finds them and keeps them.\n\nIn \"Unexpected\", Matt receives a call from Ted, who wants to meet Matt along with Hana Gitelman. Hana informs Matt of Primatech and the connection to their abductions and the markings on their necks. Ted wants to confront Mr. Bennet, but needs Matt's help. Matt agrees. Matt and Ted confront Mr. Bennet and his family at gunpoint as the family was coming home. However, things turn sour and Matt is soon captured again.\n\nIn \"Parasite\", it is revealed that Matt is a prisoner of Thompson and his associates. Then in \".07%\", Bennet helps Matt and Ted escape. Over breakfast, they solidify their plans to travel to New York City to knock out a tracking system. In \"The Hard Part\", Matt, Bennet and Ted continue their mission. They later are shown walking at Kirby Plaza in New York City, where Bennet and Claire are reunited. The group then splits in two, with Peter, Claire and Ted going to a remote town in Nebraska, and Matt and Bennet continuing with their mission to destroy the tracking system. Matt gets them where they need to go.\n\nWhile waiting for the elevator, they bump into Jessica and her husband, D.L. Bennet and Matt then go to where the tracking system is, only to find Thompson waiting. Matt saves Bennet from death, and Bennet kills Thompson. The two then find the tracking system, surprised to find Molly Walker. Matt protests killing her, but Bennet says it must be done. They argue with Bennet until Matt is knocked out by Mohinder from behind.\n\nIn the finale, \"How to Stop an Exploding Man\", Matt finds Sylar and shoots him. However, Sylar reverses the bullets and gravely wounds Matt.\n\nIn \"Four Months Later...,\" it is revealed Matt divorced Janice and that he is now a detective for the NYPD, and is taking care of Molly Walker in Mohinder's apartment. He learns Molly is having nightmares of a dangerous man who can see her when she thinks of him. In \"Lizards\", Matt is investigating the murder of Kaito Nakamura. He interrogates Angela Petrelli and learns that someone may have murdered Kaito for revenge; but Angela refuses to be interrogated further. Matt later saves Angela from a mysterious attacker. In \"The Kindness of Strangers, Matt finds out that his father is part of The Company and that he is the dangerous man frightening Molly. Molly tries to find him for Matt, but she ends up in a coma.\n\nIn \"Fight or Flight\" Matt and Nathan track down Matt's father. When they find him, he reveals he is also a telepath, and is also about to be murdered. At first he seems sorry for having left Matt as a child but ends up tricking Matt and Nathan in separate illusions. Matt is trapped in jail, confronted by his ex-wife and the baby she gave birth to after the divorce. It is indicated that while she said that the baby she was having wasn't Matt's, he knew that this wasn't true. Matt is able to telepathically talk to Nathan and escape the illusion, finding that Bob is set to be killed.\n\nIn \"Out of Time\", Matt discovers he is able to manipulate people and uses it to find the last unknown survivor of the photograph by \"interrogating\" Angela Petrelli. He also finally defeats his father because he learns that like his father he is able to control all aspects of the brain. He manages to tap into this and enter the nightmare Molly's trapped in and summon his father into it. He realizes it's his father's own nightmare and after a battle of wills leaves it with Molly and uses his powers to trap his father in his own nightmare. In \"Powerless\", he goes with Nathan to intercept Peter and Adam Monroe, in hopes of stopping them from releasing a deadly virus that would kill 93% of the world's population. Before leaving to confront them, Angela warns Matt that if they cannot stop Peter, that he'll have to kill him. Upon meeting Peter at Primatech, Matt attempts to compel Peter to stop Adam. Though this proves unsuccessful, Nathan is later able to convince Peter that Adam has tricked him. Together, they manage to stop the virus, and resolve to reveal their secret, and the Company, to the world. Nathan enlists Matt's help to use his powers in convincing the media to hear him out. At the conference, Matt is present when Nathan is gunned down before he can reveal their secrets, but is unable to locate the assailant immediately after the attack.\n\nIn \"The Second Coming\", after Nathan is shot, Matt and Peter chase the assailant, a future version of Peter, finding nothing. Matt later confronts the future Peter, who is disguised as his present self, when he becomes suspicious of his actions. Future Peter then removes his disguise, confesses that he is from the future and shot Nathan, and teleports Matt to an unknown location in Africa, because he knows too much. In \"The Butterfly Effect\", he is rescued by Usutu, who paints the future, particularly Parkman's life. He learns Parkman's name by reading it off his badge.\n\nIn \"I Am Become Death\", Matt sees the future through a dream caused by Usutu. In the dream, he finds himself still living with Molly in the same apartment as he did in the second season, only this time accompanied with another daughter, called Daniella, and the baby's mother, Daphne. Matt expresses his concern of Daphne still working for Pinehearst when she comes by to ask Molly where the present Peter fled to. Matt is next seen in awed silence watching a news report on the nuclear explosion in Costa Verde (caused by Sylar), with Molly, worried that Daphne was caught in the blast. Daphne arrives home seconds later with a smile, but gasps that she wasn't fast enough before collapsing in Matt's arms. Matt then wakes up to realize that he never left Usutu or the desert, and realizes that he must find Daphne to keep her from suffering the same fate she did in his dream. Usutu tells him that only Matt can find his way, and that he must follow his spirit guide. Matt is confused, but then notices the tortoise he saw right before meeting Usutu, and realizes it is his spirit guide. He is then seen following the tortoise as it moves slowly through the desert.\n\nIn \"Dying of the Light\", Matt has arrived at an airport with the tortoise. He is greeted by Daphne, who is shocked that he knows her name. He tells her that they are soulmates, which she doesn't believe, instead offering him a job at Pinehearst. She tells him to wait for her. After a while he decides to go ahead and leave. Daphne returns in time to stop him. She says he's a good guy and the people at Pinehearst aren't. She advises him to stay away. He tells her she should keep away from them as well. She tells him that she can't and leaves.\n\nIn \"Eris Quod Sum\", Daphne is directed by Arthur Petrelli to kill Matt after he does not come to Pinehearst. She has the gun pointed at Matt, but drops it. Knox, however, has followed her, and after knocking Daphne unconscious rips his hand through Matt, apparently killing him. After he leaves, this proves to be a dream sequence manifested by Matt. However, soon after this Daphne receives a call from Arthur revealing that she is fooling Matt into trusting her for an unknown purpose.\n\nIn \"It's Coming\", he and Daphne go to Primatech for help and find Angela in a coma. Matt decides to use his powers to try to wake her up. After Daphne supposedly goes to find a nurse but in reality alerts Arthur to his plans, Matt enters Angela's mind like he entered Molly's to save her from Maury. In Angela's mind, he finds her handcuffed to a chair and she tells him to leave as Arthur is too powerful. As he tries to free her, Arthur shows up disguised as Daphne and stabs him. When this wound manifests physically, the real Daphne grabs on to him and manages to get him to pull her into Angela's mind. Once there, Arthur reveals that Daphne had betrayed him, but while Daphne admits this, she repents, saying she loves Matt and the two embrace. Angela manages to convince Arthur to let her go and Matt pulls himself, Daphne and Angela back to the real world, finally waking her up. His psychic wound heals at this point. He then encounters Peter and attacks him for sending Matt to Africa, but Peter is able to convince him, after Matt verifies telepathically, that it wasn't him. Matt is present when Angela reveals that there's a catalyst needed for the formula and Claire realizes that it could be her.\n\nIn \"The Eclipse\", Matt (like everyone else) loses his powers thanks to the eclipse, and Daphne goes home. When he goes to visit her, he discovers that Daphne had trouble walking before she gained her powers. He is later approached by Ando and Hiro, who want him to restore Hiro's memory after it was erased by Arthur, but he is unable to do so due to Hiro's inability to speak English, and aids them in finding a way to restore his memories by looking through \"9th Wonders\" comic books. When the eclipse is over, he helps Daphne reconcile with her father.\n\nIn \"Dual\", Matt, Daphne, and Ando discover that Hiro is trapped in the past, and Daphne steals a vial of Mohinder's superpower-granting formula so Ando can give himself powers and save him. Instead of gaining Hiro's power of space-time manipulation, however, Ando gains the ability to enhance the powers of other evolved humans, which enhances Matt's telepathy to the point where he can hear every thought in the city, and enhances Daphne's speed to the point where she can travel through time, which they use to rescue Hiro. Later, they successfully steal the formula and destroy it.\n\nMatt is seen trying to live a normal life with Daphne, as a bodyguard. He begins seeing Usutu in his apartment, who tells him that he is becoming a prophet, like himself. Although Usutu is clearly dead, and he himself states he is an illusion, it is unclear how he is interacting with Matt. Matt then begins drawing the future like Usutu and Isaac Mendez. He is captured when Claire comes to warn him of Nathan rounding up the rest of the superhumans, and is seen on the plane with the rest when it goes down. Matt survives the crash and escapes together with Mohinder and Hiro Nakamura. He gets a vision from Usutu and leads his friends to a nearby trailer. There, he starts to draw under the spiritual guidance of Usutu. One of the pictures reveals Daphne getting shot in her shoulder near the plane crash, even though she wasn't on the plane. Daphne herself has run together with Ando Masahasi to the crash site to find him. After they find each other, Matt and Daphne embrace but she ends up shot by Danko's soldiers, just as depicted in Matt's paintings. Matt mind controls one of the soldiers, forcing him to shoot his comrades. The distraction allows Matt to escape with Hiro, Ando and Mohinder, leaving a presumably dead Daphne behind. Matt and Mohinder reunite with Peter Petrelli, Ando and Hiro and make plans what to do next.\n\nAt the end of \"Building 26\" and continued in \"Cold Wars\", Matt is seen kidnapping a drugged Noah Bennet at a bar along with Peter and Mohinder. The trio then take Noah to a Motel and Matt attempts to access Noah's memories about the Government's initiative and his meetings with Nathan Petrelli and The Hunter. He discovers that Bennet has warned Mohinder about the attacks, which leads to a fight between them with Mohinder, but then Bennet reveals that Daphne is alive and under custody.\n\nMatt is subsequently captured by the government while trying to rescue Daphne. With Peter having sent a tape to the national news of the government illegally loading up American civilians, The Hunter states that he needs something to blame posthumans for. He drugs Matt and straps explosives to him, pushing him out of a van and behind the Capitol Building. The explosives are disarmed when Nathan intervenes, however, and the government apprehends Matt once again.\n\nIn \"Cold Snap\", Matt, Mohinder, Tracy, and Daphne escape from the facility with help from Rebel. Matt takes Daphne with him to a hospital where she is treated for her gunshot wound. He enters Daphne's mind in her last moment of life, creating a fictional storybook ending for her in Paris to make her happy. However, she tells him to let go.\n\nIn \"Turn and Face the Strange\", Matt attempts to fulfill his lust for revenge against Danko by revealing the truth to Danko's girlfriend, who is unaware of what he really does for a living. Matt then prepares to kill her but cannot bring himself to do it. With nothing to live for, he allows Danko to fire at him. However, Hiro freezes time and rescues Matt. Matt meets his son and is last seen with Matt Parkman Jr. in the back of a car as Hiro and Ando enter.\n\nIn \"I Am Sylar\", Hiro and Ando try to convince Matt to join them bringing down Building 26, but he refuses as he wants to be there for his kid and feels he must retrieve Matt Jr. to Janice back in LA. Once there, he is ought to help Janice and Jr. escape HLS agents and eventually have a life together as a family, but then he realizes than he must help Hiro and Ando so they all will be safe from Building 26. As the agents get inside the house, Matt makes them believe nobody is there.\n\nIn \"An Invisible Thread\", Matt is seen heading to Washington D.C. to join Hiro and Ando; once in the bus stop, he meets Angela who finally convinces him about the importance of Nathan, and that he will save him. They both enter the battle room to find Nathan's dead body. Later, when Sylar is drugged and Peter and Claire are sent away, Angela and Noah convince Matt to brainwash Sylar making him believe he is the real Nathan, due to the fact that he got his appearance and memories, because they all need him to stop the hunt of posthumans. Along with Angela and Noah, they are the only ones that knows the truth about Nathan being dead and Sylar alive impersonating him. He is among the people who witness \"Sylar\" (James Martin) being cremated at Coyote Sands.\n\nIn \"Orientation\", Matt is living a comfortable life with his wife and son. Ever since he forced Sylar to turn into Nathan, Matt has sworn off using his power. When Angela calls asking for help with Sylar, Matt refuses. Later, Matt begins experiencing a hallucination of Sylar, who tells him that when Matt forced his way into Sylar's mind, a part of the serial killer latched on to Matt's own brain. Sylar wants his body back, which Matt says he won't let happen. Sylar begins to harass Matt to force him to lose control and use his power. Matt has an outburst at his addiction meeting (where he refers to his power in vague terms as his \"addiction\") and later on when Matt is interrogating a suspect. Finally, Sylar goads Matt into using his power to drive away the handsome water delivery boy, because Matt was jealous of the delivery boy's relationship with his wife and son.\n\nIn \"Ink\", Matt thinks his one use of his power was a slip up, and turns in his 30-day sobriety chip. Sylar continues to taunt Matt, who says that he will ignore him since Sylar has no real power locked up in Matt's head. While investigating the house of a suspected drug dealer, Sylar points out to Matt that his suspect is hiding in a closet with a gun. Matt is stunned when Sylar turns out to be correct. After the suspect is tied up, Matt's partner checks upstairs, and Sylar points out a pink stuffed bunny in the next room, hinting that a little girl has been kidnapped. Matt finds a ransom note, confirming this fear. Matt reads the suspect's mind and finds the girl's body. He goes berserk and starts pounding the suspect. His partner re-enters the room and demands to know what Matt is doing. Matt tries to explain, but suddenly the bunny, ransom note, and body are gone. Sylar taunts that he used Matt's own power against him, and made him see things that weren't there, and Matt realizes that Sylar does have power over him. Matt's partner is planning to call him in, but Matt, not wanting his life to be ruined, uses his power to convince his partner that the beating of the suspect was justified, and causes him to call it in as such. Sylar gives Matt an ultimatum: either give his body back, or Sylar will continually ruin Matt's life.\n\nMatt still refuses to return Sylar to his body, and in \"Strange Attractors\", Sylar takes control of Matt's body while he's making love to Janice. Matt, fearing that this new development will put his family in danger, reveals what is happening to him to Janice and she offers to take their son and leave to let Matt deal with it. Matt discovers that drinking alcohol appears to injure Sylar, and quickly downs several glasses. Sylar finally appears to disappear, and Matt blacks out right as Janice returns with Matt's partner from the force. Matt awakens hours later, and talks with his wife and partner, vowing to never let this happen to him again. However, it is revealed that Sylar took control of Matt's body while he was blacked out, and now is controlling him completely.\n\nIn \"Shadowboxing\", Matt attempts suicide by cop to prevent Sylar from taking revenge on the people who separated his mind from his body; he is last shown in an ambulance as they try to revive him. In \"Brother's Keeper\", he is healed by Peter and explains the situation, but Nathan brushes up against Matt's hand during a struggle with a guard, allowing Sylar to transfer back in. Simultaneously horrified at Nathan's plight and relieved at his own, Matt uses his telepathy to sneak out of the hospital.\n\nIn \"The Art of Deception\", Matt is confronted by Sylar upon coming home from the store and is shocked, believing Sylar is somehow in his head again. However, it is Sylar in his own body again and Sylar, wanting to become human again, demands that Matt put a block on his powers. Matt is unable to do anything due to feedback, but is able to read Sylar's mind enough to tell that he's actually serious. Sylar ends up threatening Janice (who finally realizes who he is), but Matt talks him down and gets him to allow Janice to leave. At Janice's suggestion, Matt decides to get rid of Sylar for good and pretends to block his powers while in reality he traps Sylar in his own worst nightmare: a world where he is completely alone with no powers and an hour in the real world equals a year there. After erasing Sylar's memory of what he did, Matt starts to brick Sylar in behind his wall when Peter arrives looking for Sylar. Peter copies Matt's powers again and, reading his mind, learns what he did. Needing Sylar's help, Peter enters Sylar's mind to free him against Matt's warnings that he might get trapped. Later, Matt fully bricks up Sylar, but leaves Peter's unconscious body lying against the wall.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" Matt is in his kitchen looking through the refrigerator when there's what sounds like an explosion, unknown to him the awakened Sylar breaking free of his prison. Matt is confronted by several Eli clones and tries to use his powers to stop them, but is unable to as only the real Eli has a mind that can be manipulated. Outnumbered and pretty much powerless, Matt is overpowered and his knee dislocated before the Elis' prepare to kill him with kitchen knives. At the last second, the clones disappear as Peter and Sylar defeat the real Eli and the other clones and knock out the Prime Eli which gets rid of the clones. Matt is pissed that Peter freed Sylar and refuses to help Peter by reading Eli's mind, so Peter does it himself and learns Samuel's terrible plans. Peter tries to take off with Sylar, but Matt mentally commands Sylar to stay and he and Peter try to convince Matt that Sylar has changed, going so far as to have Matt read his mind. Matt says that while Sylar's mind wants to change, he can't tell what his heart wants, but gives him a chance and orders him and Peter out. Alone with the unconscious Eli, Matt brainwashes him into turning against Samuel which ultimately helps defeat him as Eli's support helps cause the carnies to turn on Samuel and strip him of his powers.\n\nIn \"June 13 - Part 2\", Matt is brought in by Harris to find out where Claire is. To Noah's shock, Matt now works for Erica and is selling his power to the highest bidder. While Erica won't save everyone, she will save some and that's all Matt cares about now. He reads Noah's mind and learns of Claire's death in childbirth but Caspar Abraham erases Noah's memories before Matt can get anymore. Caspar knocks out Harris and while Matt has the two at his mercy, he can't bring himself to harm them and lets them both go.\n\n\nMatt is a telepath, able to read and manipulate the thoughts of others. In the episode \"Out of Time\", Bob states that Matt, like his father, should be able to control all aspects of the mind, including thoughts and senses, with practice. Matt originally could not activate his at will, causing him to pick up the thoughts of all those in close proximity to him. He gradually learns to elicit specific thoughts from people, and eventually learns to compel individuals to do as he wishes.\n\nThough Matt's power enables him to read the minds of most people, it can be defeated through various methods. The Haitian's power is able to nullify Matt's, protecting himself and those in his vicinity. Other telepaths, such as Peter Petrelli and Maury Parkman, are also able to shield their minds. Finally, since Matt only speaks English, he cannot understand thoughts in other languages; Noah Bennet is able to defeat Matt's power by thinking in Japanese, which also happens with the child-minded Hiro who didn't know English. Although in \"Cold Wars\" Matt was able to overcome this while displaying a new ability with his telepathy where he was able to make his victims relive past events by going through their memory, while doing this to his victims such as Noah Bennet, it causes them pain. However, this is merely due to them resisting his efforts and it is shown that if the person who he's doing it to allows him to do it of their own free will, there's no pain.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Matt's mind-reading is that it allows him to read any thoughts going through a person's mind - at one point, Matt read Jessica Sanders' mind and heard Niki in there as well. Jessica was surprised (\"You heard Niki?\").\n\nHe is able to enter the minds of various individuals in different episodes, including Nathan Petrelli, Molly Walker, and Angela Petrelli. When Maury traps Matt inside Molly's \"nightmare world\", Matt is able to bring his father in with them and subsequently leave with Molly, trapping Maury in his own nightmare (though Maury escapes). He later enters Angela's mind to free her after Arthur Petrelli traps her in her own mind and succeeds with Daphne's help, gaining the ability to pull people in with him at the same time. Apparently to free someone trapped in their own mind, someone has to enter it as Peter later has to do the same thing to free Sylar when Matt traps him in a nightmare. In \"Cold Snap\" he enters Daphne's mind to give her a fairytale ending while she dies.\n\nMatt's ability to compel others is not as honed as his father's, though he demonstrates the ability at various points.\n\nMatt can place suggestions in others through telepathic commands as a form of mind control, but those aware of what he is doing can resist. In \"Cautionary Tales\", Angela Petrelli initially resists his commands, though she experiences a nosebleed and eventually succumbs.\n\nIn \"Eris Quod Sum\", Matt is able to make the villain Knox see an illusion of Daphne and Matt himself dying, as well as momentarily immobilize him physically. In \"Cold Snap\" and \"I Am Sylar\" he is able to make agents ignore him and company, making them believe there was no one at the place.\n\nIn Volume Four, the combination of the growth of his telepathy and the precognitive visions induced by Usutu grants him access to the \"same plane of consciousness\" that other precognitive characters access for their own powers, allowing him to draw the future. Unlike Isaac Mendez, he didn't show any artistic skills until gaining this ability, which also happens to other characters.\n\nIn \"The Art of Deception\", Matt tries to use his telepathy to remove Sylar's powers by putting a mental block on them. Due to feedback, he is unable to, but is able to read Sylar's mind enough to know that he is actually serious about this. Ultimately Matt uses his powers to trap Sylar in a nightmare where he has no powers and is alone, similar to what his father once did to Molly Walker. In this nightmare one hour in the real world equals one year in the nightmare. Sylar is ultimately freed from his nightmare by Peter Petrelli who enters his mind and frees him like Matt did for Molly Walker and Angela Petrelli.\n"}

He is the president of International Institute of Management, a U.S. based research organization. His work at the institute focuses on economic, investment, and business strategies.\n\nMed Jones is one of few economists who predicted the Great Recession of 2008 caused by the burst of the United States housing bubble, the Subprime mortgage crisis and the Stock market crash of 2008\n\nIn a 2006 white paper, he listed three major U.S. economic risks for the decade between 2007-2017.\nThe risks included the housing bubble and consumer debt, among the main risks to the US economy. In March 2007, in a Reuters' Interview, he, again, said the impact of the subprime mortgages will not be limited to the housing sector, he warned about increased bankruptcies, stock market crash, and a loss of the confidence in the US economy. According to Reuters, “He said the bursting of the real estate bubble and high consumer debt were a major worry\" and “if people started to think there may be a lot of bankruptcies (in the subprime lending market), then you’re going to see the stock market sell-off.” More importantly, he explicitly warned about a much worse economic crisis as a result of the subprime mortgages, stating that “The worst thing that could happen to any economy is the loss of confidence”.\n\nIn 2007 the Federal Reserve was still blind to the impact of the housing bubble and subprime crash. In August 2007, the New York Federal Reserve reported that for the most part, Bear Stearns' (mortgage-related financial) problems did not pose a substantial risk to the economy. The Fed Chairman stated that: \"The housing market has looked a bit more solid, and the worst outcomes have been made less likely\". In May 2008. In a congressional testimony, the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he saw only a \"limited\" impact of subprimes on \"the broader housing market.\" \n\nIn 2009, top economists and some Nobel laureates in Economics, came under criticism for defending their failure to see the crisis, stating that the economic crisis was unpredictable. According to Wharton University, \"What made it worse is that not only the top economists failed to predict it, they positively denied that it will happen.\" \n\nEconomic forecasting is the holy grail of investing. Wall Street spends billions of dollars on economic research and analysis. Accurate economic forecasting is regarded by academics and investors to be next to impossible. Yet, sometimes some analysts emerge with a specific view that contradicts the mainstream and with exceptional accuracy they prove the most respected economists and investors wrong. Among the economists who predicted the crisis, Jones' predictions are considered the most accurate.\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama Administration and mainstream economists at leading think tanks, were focused on finding ways to restore\"economic confidence\". \nIn 2015, seven years after the Great Recession, academic researchers presented a paper at the World Economic Forum explaining that economic confidence was not fully taken into consideration in academia and it was a major factor for recovery from great recession.\n\nInvestors and investment advisers who follow Jones' predictions regard him among the prominent independent thinking money managers and economists.\n\nDespite having the most accurate forecasting record of the great recession and recovery, he advises investors against using his own forecasts. Jones believes economic forecasting is unreliable and Wall Street is a casino. In one interview, he says \"I do not advise anyone to invest based on my outlook of the economy. The truth is that when people invest on Wall Street, they are essentially making bets about the future.” In addition, although he is known for his work on economics, he tries to distance himself from the economic profession.\n\nMr. Jones is credited with the introduction of the first Gross National Happiness Index (GNH Index) in 2005, also known as Gross National Well-being Index (GNW Index).\nIn 2006, he published a white paper titled the American Pursuit of Unhappiness calling on policymakers, economists and researchers implement the first GNH Index framework. \n\nThe term Gross National Happiness (GNH) was coined in 1972 by Sicco Mansholt one of the Founding Fathers of the European Union and the fourth President of the European Commission. GNH is often misattributed to Bhutan's fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck who popularized the concept in the late 1990s. The GNH philosophy suggested that the ideal purpose of governments is to promote happiness. The philosophy remained difficult to implement due to the subjective nature of happiness and the lack of exact quantitative definition of GNH and the lack of a practical model to measure the impact of economic policies on the subjective well-being of the citizens.\n\nThe purpose of the GNH Index was to create a new metric as an alternative to the traditional GDP indicator, the new metric would integrates subjective and objective socioeconomic development policy framework and measurement indicators. The GNH Index was designed to transform the first generation abstract subjective political mission statement into a second generation implementation holistic (objective and subjective) concept and by treating happiness as a socioeconomic development metric. The proposed metric measures socioeconomic development by tracking seven wellness development areas: economic, environmental, physical, mental, workplace, social, and political via objective data and subjective results via survey. GNH value is proposed to be an index function of the total average per capita. In the same year, he published a global GNH Index survey blueprint that can benchmark the subjective well-being in different countries, correlate happiness levels with differences in local policies to help identify best practices and major socioeconomic policy issues. The first Global Gross National Happiness Index Survey was launched in 2005.\n\nAfter the introduction of GNH index initiative in 2005, several initiatives were launched that adapted the gross national happiness index to their community.\n\nIn a report (2012) prepared for the US Congressman Hansen Clarke, R, Researchers Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, at John F. Kennedy School of Government in Harvard University, recommended that \"the Congress should prescribe the broad parameters of new, carefully designed supplemental national indicators; it should launch a bipartisan commission of experts to address unresolved methodological issues, and include alternative indicators.\" They proposed that the government can use the survey results to see which well-being dimensions are least satisfied and which districts and demographic groups are most deficient, so as to allocate resources accordingly. The report list the Gross National Happiness Index and its seven measurement area as one of the main frameworks to consider.\n\nIn 2007 Thailand releases Green and Happiness Index (GHI).\n\nIn 2009, In the United States, the Gallup poll system launched the happiness survey and collected data on a national scale. The Gallup Well-Being Index was modelled after the GNH Index framework of 2005. The Well-Being Index score is an average of six sub-indexes that measures life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviours, and access to basic necessities. In October 2009, the USA scored 66.1/100.\n\nIn 2010 the Bhutan GNH Index was conducted for the first time, the Bhutan GNH Index is similar to the first GNH Index created by Med Jones \n\nIn 2011 UN General Assembly Resolution 65/309, titled \"Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development\" \n\nIn 2011 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launches \"Better Life Index\" (BLI).\n\nIn 2011 Canadian Index of Wellbeing Network (CIW Network) releases The Canadian Index of Wellbeing (CIW) \n\nIn 2011, a leading Israeli newspaper Haaretz, published an article suggesting that western GDP economics is an incomplete development model and called for the adoption of Bhutan's GNH philosophy and Jones' GNH Index in Israel.\n\nIn 2012, the city of Seattle in Washington, launched its own happiness index initiative, emphasizing measures similar to the GNH Index.\n\nIn 2012 South Korea Launched Happiness Index citing the GNH Index framework.\n\nIn India, Government of Goa 2030 Vision and Roadmap in (2012) cited the GNH Index as a model for measuring happiness.\n\nIn 2014 The government of Dubai launched its localized Happiness Index to measure the public's contentment and satisfaction with different government services.\n\nIn 2014 the United Kingdom launched its own well-being and happiness statistics .\n\nIn 2012 Professor Peter T. Coleman, a world-renowned director of the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution at Columbia University, suggested that Jones' GNH Index initiative could inform the Global Peace Index Initiative GPI.\n\nOther noteworthy Happiness Index initiatives that followed the GNH Index of 2005 are the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD Better Life Index in 2011, World Happiness Report in 2011 and the Social Progress Index SPI in 2013\n\nMed Jones is identified as an independent in his profile on Wall Street Economists \n\n"}

His mother Devorah Leah died just three years later, and her father Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi raised him as his own son. He married his first cousin Chaya Mushka Schneersohn, daughter of Rabbi Dovber Schneuri. After his father-in-law/uncle's death, and a three-year interregnum during which he tried to persuade the Hasidim to accept his brother-in-law Menachem-Nachum Schneuri or his uncle Chaim-Avraham as their leader, he assumed the leadership of Lubavitch on the eve of Shavuot 5591 (May 5, 1831 OS).\n\nHe was known as the \"Tzemach Tzedek\" (\"Righteous Sprout\" or \"Righteous Scion\"), after the title of a voluminous compendium of \"halakha\" (Jewish law) that he authored. He also authored \"Derech Mitzvotecha\" (\"Way of Your Commandments\"), a mystical exposition of the \"Mitzvos\". He compiled major works of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi for publication, including the \"Siddur L'Kol Ha'Shanah\" (commonly known as \"Siddur Im Dach\"), \"Likutei Torah\" and \"Torah Ohr\". He also authored a philosophical text entitled \"Sefer Chakira: Derech Emuna\" (Book of Philosophy: The Way of Faith).\n\nThe Tzemach Tzedek enjoyed close ties with other Jewish leaders. In the course of his battle against the \"Haskalah\" in Russia, he forged a close alliance with Rabbi Yitzchak of Valozhyn, a major leader of the misnagdim, which led to warmer relations between them and the Hasidim.\n\nAccording to Baruch Epstein, his father Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein spent six months under the Tzemach Tzedek's tutelage, and learned most of his mystical knowledge during that time. This story is disputed by Hassidic historian Yehoshua Mondshein.\n\nHis close friendship with professor J Berstenson, the Czar's court physician, often helped the delicate negotiations relating to the welfare of the community.\n\nHe set up an organisation called \"Hevras Techiyas Hameisim\" to assist Jewish boy-soldiers who were being recruited and converted to Christianity by the Russian army. These soldiers known as Cantonists were taken away from the Jewish community to other villages. Schneersohn arranged for his students to pay them regular visits to keep up their spirits and discourage them from converting.\n\nIn 1844-45 he took steps to increase the enrollment and viability of the Lubavitch Yeshivas in Dubroŭna, Pasana, Lyozno and Kalisz, expanding their enrollment to around 600 students in total.\nRepeated attempts by the authorities to entrap him using informers such as Hershel Hodesh, Benjamin the Apostate and Lipman Feldman failed.\n\nHe died in Lubavitch on 13 Nissan 5626 at the age of 77, leaving behind him seven sons and two daughters. He was succeeded by one of his youngest sons, Shmuel as the Rebbe of Lubavitch, while three of his other sons formed breakaways of the Chabad movement which continue to some extent even today.\n\nSeveral of his sons established Chasidic dynasties, see #Sons.\n\nA famous saying of the Tzemach Tzedek is \"Think good and it will be good\" (original Yiddish: \"Trakht gut vet zein gut\"). This expresses the Chabad view that simply by virtue of a person's trust in God, that person's prayer may be answered.\n\nThe Tzemach Tzedek had seven sons:\n\n1. Rabbi Baruch Shalom (1805–1869) did not become a rebbe in his own right; he chose to remain in Lubavitch and become a chasid of his youngest brother. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch, was his great-great-grandson.\n\n2. Rabbi Yehuda Leib Schneersohn (Maharil) (1808–1866) settled in Kopys a few months after the death of his father, where he founded the Kopust branch of Chabad. He died two months later. He had three sons:\n\n3. Rabbi Chaim Schneur Zalman (1814–1880) was Rebbe in Lyady after his father, the Tzemach Tzedek died. He founded the Liadi branch of Chabad. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Yitzchak Dovber (1835–1910) of Liadi, author of \"Siddur Maharid\", and his son-in-law, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak (d. 1905) of Siratin, a scion of the Rebbe of Radzimin.\n\n4. Rabbi Yisroel Noach (1815–1883) of Nizhyn founded the Niezhin branch of Chabad. Although officially a Rebbe, he had only a small following. He had no successor. His son was Rabbi Avraham Schneerson of Kischinev, whose daughter, Nechama Dina Schneersohn, married Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the sixth Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch.\n\n5. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak (1822–1876) was a Rebbe in Ovruch. He founded the Avrutch branch of Chabad. He was compelled to assume this position by his father-in-law, Rabbi Yaakov Yisroel of Cherkas (son of Rabbi Mordechai of Chernobyl and son-in-law of the Mitteler Rebbe) against his father’s wishes. He was the maternal grandfather and namesake of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the sixth Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch.\n\n6. Rabbi Yaakov, although leaving descendants, died at quite a young age. He lived in Orsha. Little is known about him.\n\n7. Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn (Maharash) (1834–1882) of Lubavitch, his youngest son, succeeded him as the Rebbe of Lubavitch.\n\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson said of the Tzemach Tzedek's work \"Ohr HaTorah\" that it contains all the previous and future teachings of the Chabad Rebbes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44933523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44933523", "title": "Nand Peeters", "text": "Nand Peeters\n\nFerdinand \"Nand\" Peeters (Mechelen, October 13, 1918 – Turnhout, December 27, 1998) was a Belgian obstetrician and gynecologist, whose research led directly to the development of Anovlar, the first combined oral contraceptive pill introduced outside the United States, in 1961, the first whose side-effects were acceptable, and the first that was used world-wide (Albach 1997:939). It remained in production, in its original formula, from its introduction until 1986 — although, beginning in 1964, Schering AG (the company that produced it) also marketed variants with lower doses of hormones, some of which continued to be named Anovlar. Nand Peeters's research also contributed substantially to the treatment of Rh-disease.\n\nNand Peeters was a son of Désiré Peeters, a surgeon who founded his own clinic in Mechelen. After attending the local Saint Rumbold's high school, he studied at the Catholic University of Leuven, intending to become a gynecologist. But he finished his training in a maternity ward in Bruges.\n\nIn 1945 he married Paula Langbeen, with whom he had six children, and who was his book-keeper all his life—Peeters detested all administrative work. \n\nIn 1946 he settled as an ob-gyn in Turnhout. At the time Turnhout had none, even though it was (and is) the largest town in the northern part of the Campine, with a population then of about 32,000. Perinatal infant mortality in Turnhout was between 10 and 12% before his arrival; in his first year in Turnhout he managed to bring it down to two cases in some 500 deliveries.\n\nHe was appointed head of the Maria Gabriël Maternity and of the gynecology department of Turnhout's municipal Saint-Elisabeth hospital in 1951. Under his direction, that department became one of the best in the country. He acquired the most modern technology available, did innovative research, encouraged young and promising doctors that he hired to do likewise, and introduced new techniques like echography. In 1952 Leuven University appointed him as one of its supervisors of trainee doctors. This appointment was withdrawn in 1963, for reasons that remain unclear.\n\nIn 1953, also in Turnhout, he founded the Saint-Elisabeth nursing school, where he taught gratis. Naturally the school provided him with well-trained nursing staff, whom he entrusted with far greater responsibilities than was customary at the time.\n\nHe retired in 1986. An intracranial hemorrhage in 1988 ended his active life—communication became impossible. He lived another ten years, dying on December 27, 1998.\n\nPeeters was first and foremost a practicing ob-gyn, a very busy and highly competent one, who stopped counting the number of deliveries that he had done when he reached the number of 30,000.\n\nThroughout his career his abiding concern was for the comfort of his patients. He was a man of few words, but a good listener, and the stories told by his patients testify to the respect in which they held him and the trust they put in him.\n\nHe did research, taught, and lectured to and published for both health care professionals and the general public. But he did all this because he hoped thereby to improve the welfare of his patients and of pregnant and nubile women in general. Typically, pain management during delivery was the first problem he tackled as a researcher, while still a trainee in Bruges.\n\nPeeters closely followed the development of various hormones and their uses in the nineteen-fifties. He was aware of the work of Pincus and of the serious side-effects of Pincus's Enovid, which was first introduced as a remedy against menstrual disorders in 1957. He knew that Schering AG had developed a number of hormones, and when Jean Frenay, a representative of Schering, told him the firm had combined two of them, norethisterone acetate and ethinylestradiol into an experimental preparation called SH-513 (containing 2 mg of the former and 0.01 mg of the latter) he asked for enough SH-513 to test it on a number of his patients. Peeters, wrote Frenay to Schering, \"principally thinks of ovulation inhibition for contraceptive purposes.\" Thus the idea of developing SH-513 into a contraceptive pill stemmed from Peeters, not from Schering. In fact, initially Schering's principal gynecologist wanted Peeters to test SH-513 as a treatment for dysmenorrhea. But eventually Peeters got formal permission from Schering to test SH-513 for the purpose of contraception.\n\nPeeters selected from his patients those whose prognosis envisioned the risks of dying in childbirth, of stillbirth, and/or of Rh disease. He told them explicitly that he was developing a new medication, and got their permission to test it on them. The results of his small-scale trial (on no more than 50 fertile married women) led him to conclude that a dose of 3 to 4 mg of norethisterone acetate and 'at least' 0.05 mg of ethinylestradiol was both efficient and had few side effects. Schering then made its SH-639 using this dose, and had it tested in trials in Germany, Australia, Japan and the USA on 14,038 menstrual cycles of 2433 women. The conclusion was an outright recommendation to introduce SH-639 as a hormonal contraceptive.\n\nBut Schering hesitated to introduce it in Germany, fearing comparison with Nazi eugenics, still a painful memory in that country. It was first introduced in Australia, on February 1961, as \"Anovlar\", a name intended to mean 'without ovulation'. The following table shows Anovlar’s introduction times in a number of countries:\n\nThe results of Peeters's research were published as Peeters F., M. Van Roy & R. Oeyen 1960. (Van Roy was Peeters's clinical biologist; Oeyen, his assistant.) Requests for offprints came flooding in from all over the world, especially after the introduction of Anovlar, over 50,000 of them.\n\nHe addressed the Third World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Vienna, September 1961) and the 60th Congress of the North-West-German Gynecological Society (Kiel, 1961). He also spoke at the Second Fertility Congress in Brussels, where he met with Eleanor Mears, co-author of a highly favorable report of a large-scale clinical trial of Anovlar, published in the prestigious \"BMJ\".\n\nIn the early sixties, his reputation was considerable.\n\nBut in his own country, Peeters faced problems. Until 1973, publications on birth control were liable to fall foul of Belgian law, which considered them obscene. In Belgium, Peeters had to keep quiet about his work.\n\nIn addition, Belgium was a very Catholic country, and at the time the Catholic Church's controlling document on hormonal contraception was \"Casti connubii\", which flatly forbade it. Peeters's employ was in the hands of the town council of Turnhout, entirely dominated by the Christian People's Party. The threat of losing his job, which he loved, was real, and he had to tread very carefully as long as the Catholic Church forbade artificial contraception and as long as Turnhout remained monolithically catholic, i.e., throughout his active life.\n\nHowever, since October 1958, John XXIII was pope, and Aggiornamento seemed possible, even in the Catholic Church's view on birth control. Nand Peeters thought so. On May 1, 1963, he was granted a short private audience with John XXIII, from which he came away with the impression \"that the pope provided support for the pill\". At any rate, in 1963 John XXIII established the \"Pontifical Commission on Birth Control\", which continued its work under the aegis of pope Paul VI, though in a much expanded composition. In 1964, Paul VI convened the First European Congress of Catholic Doctors (Malta, 1964), which was almost entirely devoted to birth control. Peeters was one of the speakers.\n\nWhen Paul VI confirmed the Catholic Church's total rejection of birth control by \"artificial methods\" in his \"Humanae vitae\" in 1968, Peeters was greatly disappointed and angry. But he was a devout and committed catholic, and he could not square it with his conscience to publicly distance himself from the teaching of his church.\n\nThe Catholic Church’s ban on birth control as well as the political situation in Turnhout left him no choice but to withdraw into silence. This he did so successfully that his own children knew only vaguely that he had had something to do with Anovlar. That it was he who actually developed it they discovered only in 1995, when Schering, ignorant of Peeters's medical condition, asked him for help in contributing to the eponymous catalog (Staupe & Vieth 1996) of \"Die Pille: Von der Lust und von der Liebe\", an exhibition put on by the German Hygiene Museum.\n\nThe result was that his name fell into oblivion. When he died, only the local Turnhout press reported on his death.\n\nPeeters never accepted his church's absolute prohibition of the pill. He never repudiated his work on Anovlar. On the contrary, he was quietly proud of it. When he was asked to contribute an article on himself in a Dutch version of \"Who's Who\", he cited just one publication, Peeters 1970, his Dutch adaptation of a German work on hormone treatment, intended for doctors. He wanted them to continue to use hormones, including Anovlar, which he discussed in this book without mentioning his role in its development. And he continued to do research, not only on Anovlar, but also on other pills, such as Eugynon, Aconcen and Sequilar. However, he published his results only in medical journals.\n\nMore importantly, he unhesitatingly prescribed the pill when he deemed that a patient's health was threatened by too many pregnancies (too often life-threatening ones—ten or twelve children was not unusual in the Campine in the sixties), by late pregnancies or by the threat of yet another stillbirth, due, e.g., to Rh-disease. He would not have others, whoever they might be, influence his medical judgment, and for him the health of his patient always remained paramount. Also, he defended in no uncertain terms a couple's right to decide on the number of children they would have: \"It is you and your husband who decide the number of your children, and that's not the pope's business.\"\n\nEven so, Peeters remained a fundamentally conservative catholic, who strongly disapproved of the loose mores of the sexual revolution, largely due to the pill, and who agreed with his church that coitus should only take place within marriage.\n\nIn 1964, Ortho Pharmaceutical asked Peeters to participate in a clinical trial of a variant of RhoGAM, its Rho(D) immune globulin. He accepted. Peeters took the lead of a small team of doctors and a great number of midwives, whom he alerted to the problem of Rh-disease and who, aware of his excellent reputation in the region, willingly cooperated. The medication was tested on more than 700 women, and the trial was a resounding success: not a single case of Rh-disease was reported, leading one of his colleagues to say that it made the Campine the first Rh-disease free region in the world.

He served as a delegate for New Jersey to the Continental Congress, where he was one of two delegates from New Jersey to sign the Articles of Confederation.\n\nNathaniel was born in Monmouth Court House, Province of New Jersey, which later became Freehold Borough, New Jersey. He attended the College Of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and graduated in 1751. He then studied medicine before setting up a practice in Monmouth County, New Jersey. His home site is now within the Borough of Freehold.\n\nDr. Scudder was active in civic and militia affairs. When the revolution split the colonies, he supported the rebel cause. He was a member of the county's Committee of Safety, and represented it in the Provincial Congress held in 1774. That same year he was named lieutenant colonel in the county's first regiment of militia. In 1776 he was elected to a one-year term as Monmouth County's first member of the newly constituted New Jersey Legislative Council, and in 1780 he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly.\n\nIn 1777, Scudder became the colonel of his militia regiment and that fall was sent as a delegate to the Continental Congress. During the summer of 1778, he was particularly busy and finally abandoned his medical practice altogether. He split his time between the Congress and militia activities. He led his regiment in the Battle of Monmouth in June. He wrote a series of impassioned letters to local and state leaders urging the adoption of the Articles of Confederation and, when New Jersey's legislature approved them in November, he endorsed them for the state at the Congress.\n\nScudder continued both forms of service for several years. Finally, on October 17, 1781, he led a part of his regiment to offer resistance to a British Army foraging party, and was killed in a skirmish near Shrewsbury, New Jersey. He is buried in the Tennent Church Graveyard in Manalapan Township. Dr. Scudder was the only member of the Continental Congress to die in battle during the Revolutionary War, and the last Colonel to die in battle.\n\n"}
{"id": "27518715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27518715", "title": "Operation Big Bird", "text": "Operation Big Bird\n\n\"Operation Big Bird\" (Filipino: \"Oplan Big Bird\") was the attempt of the Philippine Government during the presidency of Corazon Aquino to recover the alleged US$7.5 billion of hidden accounts and assets of President Ferdinand Marcos and his family in the Swiss banks. Conceived by Philippine banker Michael de Guzman, it commenced shortly after Marcos was forced into asylum in the United States. Initially, Operation Big Bird did not recover any money with two differing reports by Representative Victorio Chaves and Senator Jovito Salonga. Chaves laid the blame upon Salonga, Solicitor-General Sedfrey Ordoñez and the Swiss bank lawyers. Salonga countered that Ordoñez had prevented the Philippine government from losing a large sum of money. Evidence suggests that de Guzman acted in good faith on behalf of the new government but that a double cross may have been present.\n\nAfter Ferdinand Marcos fled the Philippines, President Aquino's Executive Order No. 1 on February 28, 1986, created the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). The mandate of the PCGG was to recover all the ill-gotten wealth of Ferdinand Marcos, his family, relatives, associates, and cronies. Salonga was called to head the PCGG.\n\nOperation Big Bird began when Filipino banker and Chairman of Credit Manila, de Guzman, contacted the Aquino administration and offered his services to recover the Marcos' wealth in the various banks in Switzerland and other countries. De Guzman then was put in touch with Brigadier General Jose T. Almonte and Charlie Avila.\n\nThe banks, financial institutions and other companies that dealt with the Marcos wealth and assets were held in various countries, namely:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmonte receives a call from Malacañang on December 24, 1986, and was called for a meeting with the President to debrief her on what actually happened in Switzerland and Austria. The meeting was confirmed by Ms. Ching Escaler, Aquino's Appointments Secretary (and later Philippine Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva and New York City) on December 29, 1986. Almonte arrived with De Guzman in Malacañang, and was met first by Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo who stalled the two along with Justice Secretary Ordoñez from meeting the President.\n\nMeanwhile, on October 21, 1988, a US Federal Grand Jury in New York indicts Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos for a US$268 million racketeering scheme, siphoning the Philippine Treasury of US$103 million, and defrauding US banks of US$165 million. By November 3, Imelda returns to Hawaii after Doris Duke posted a US$5 million bail.\n\nThe Philippine Government thus lost its chance to recover the money in the Marcos Swiss accounts through 'Operation Big Bird. The whole fiasco was then brought into light by the Philippine House of Representatives' Committee on Public Accountability in mid-1989, under the Chairmanship of Cong. Victorico \"Concoy\" Chaves (2nd District, Misamis Oriental).\n\nThe Chaves Report suggested that the Philippine Government would have immediately recovered the $213 million in July 1986 from Credit Suisse and its affiliates had the operation not been stopped by PCGG Chairman Salonga and Solicitor-General Ordoñez, and that this would have \"paved the way to the recovery of the other deposits of the Marcoses with the Swiss banks\" which was estimated by the Chaves Report to be at least $3 billion.\n\nOn the side of De Guzman and Gen. Almonte however, they also lay the blame on Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo, and Philippine Ambassador to Bern, Luis Ascalon, aside from Ordoñez and Salonga. Jovito Salonga, who by 1989 was already the Senate President, and Ordoñez who became Justice Secretary, have fully denied these accusations.\n\nThe Chaves Report also rejected the view of the Swiss attorneys and PCGG Chairman Jovito R. Salonga that they had saved the Philippine Government from a massive theft. It concluded that if the funds were remitted to the Vienna bank to the account of Philippine government, whose authorized joint signatories were Solicitor-General Ordoñez and Gen. Almonte, there was no realistic chance that De Guzman would have stolen the money. In addition to this the Exportfinanzierungsbank in Vienna was also strictly regulated by the Austrian Federal Market Authority (FMA), and that the bank's board even had Almonte, Ordoñez, and Amb. Alejandro Melchor - ensuring the Philippine government's interest in the bank protected. And finally, De Guzman expected to receive a commission of $40 million (i.e. a 20% commission on the $213 million) if the monies were recovered, and thus he had an interest in ensuring that recovery did take place.\n\nOn December 20, 1990, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland decided that the US$213 Million along with other banking documents should be transferred to the Philippine government, with conditions however.\n\nOn August 10, 1995, the PCGG filed with the District Attorney in Zurich, Switzerland, an additional request for the immediate transfer of the deposits to an escrow account in the Philippine National Bank (PNB). The request was granted. On appeal by the Marcoses, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, in a decision dated December 10, 1997, upheld the ruling of the District Attorney of Zurich granting the request for the transfer of the funds. In 1998, the funds were remitted to the Philippines in escrow.\n\nOn December 10, 1997 under the Swiss Federal Act of International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (IMAC), the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, issued the final decision to transfer the fund to the Sandiganbayan which now grew to US$540 Million due to interest.\n\nAlso in 1997 the Philippine Senate's Blue Ribbon Committee and the House of Representatives' Committee on Good Government, would again review the saga of Operation Big Bird, with the same conclusion. Aquino's Vice President, Salvador Laurel would reflect that this their administration's greatest failure.\n\nStarting April 1998 up to July of that year, the Swiss authorities started transferring the identified Marcos money in Swiss banks to an escrow account in the PNB.\n\nOn July 29, 1999, Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Francis E. Garchitorena denies the motion to release US$150 million from the funds to pay Marcos human rights victims.\n\nOn October 27, 1999, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee held a special hearing in the Philippine Consulate in Honululu. In the hearing, businessman Enrique Zobel testified that in early 1989, he met with Marcos as he was for asking a US$250 million loan from him. Zobel in turn, refused it unless there was a financial backing. Marcos later produced documents of a Vatican trust in gold accounts to pay off the loan.\n\nOn February 4, 2004, the Marcos money which now grew to US$683 million, was finally transferred by PNB to the Bureau of the Treasury.\n\nAccording to the Agrarian Reform Law, part of the retrieved Marcos wealth will be utilized for the government's agrarian reform program, and the remaining part for the compensation of the victims of the Marcos dictatorship. Once all pending legalities were settled regarding the US$683 Million in escrow, the fund was finally transferred to the Department of Agrarian Reform and Department of Agriculture.\n\nHowever, by 2005, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) reports that the portion of the money was diverted by the Arroyo administration for the President's campaign during the 2004 elections. This led to Senate Blue Ribbon Committee inquiry concluding that Pres. Arroyo mismanaged the fund - which then became known as the Fertilizer Fund scam.\n\n\n"}

As the first Malay graduate MP, he was also highly regarded as Cikgu Sha'ari, for his role as educator.\n\nSha'ari was born in Kuala Pilah, Negri Sembilan, Federated Malay States (now Malaysia). \nHe was an ethnic Malay of Minangkabau descent and was the eldest of six siblings. He was educated at the Malay School in Kuala Pilah and completed his primary education in the sixth grade (Darjah 6) during the Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1942–1945.\n\nAfter the war, Sha'ari completed his primary education in Singapore at Outram School (now Outram Secondary School) in less than three years. He later had his secondary education at Victoria School and on obtaining his Senior Cambridge Certificate, joined the Teachers' Training College (now National Institute of Education) and started his teaching career in 1957.\n\nSha'ari taught in various primary schools between 1954 and 1960.

The Government's implementation of a large-scale public housing programme caused many residents from largely rural areas to be relocated to various parts of the island. There was a strong need to establish closer rapport with the people, especially in the Malay community and help them understand the need for better public housing.\n\nAs one of the first few Singaporean Malay scholars in the 1960s, Sha'ari was approached by the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, to join the People's Action Party (PAP) and to contest in the republic's general elections. Dedicated to teaching and his students, it took much persuasion before Sha'ari agreed to join politics. He strongly believed in a strong foundation in education among the younger generation of citizens, and being in Parliament would enable him to continue his work and do more for the nation.\n\nIn February 1968 Sha'ari retired temporarily from Government Service to enable him to stand as a PAP candidate for Kampong Chai Chee in the 1968 Singapore General Elections.

That same year he contested in the General Elections in Bedok constituency and was returned with a majority vote of nearly 75 percent.\n\nOn 28 September 1978, as the Member of Parliament for Bedok Constituency, he officially opened Bedok View Secondary School, the 139th school built by the government and the first government secondary school to be built within Bedok New Town.\n\nIn February 1977 Sha'ari rejoined the Ministry of Education as an aided Education Officer.

He is the owner of stationery chain Ryman, the homewares specialist Robert Dyas and lingerie retailer Boux Avenue.\n\nThe 2017 \"Sunday Times Rich List\" estimated his wealth at £286 million, listing him as the 406th richest person in the UK.\n\nIn May 2018, Solent University in Southampton named Paphitis as their new Chancellor. He will assume the role in October 2018.\nPaphitis was inaugurated as the university's Chancellor on October 11 2018. He will serve a minimum of three years. Paphitis succeeded Lord West of Spithead.\n\nTheodoros Paphitis was born on 24 September 1959 in Limassol. He is the second of three brothers, with elder brother Marinos and younger brother George. They also share two half-brothers. Paphitis moved to London with his parents and Marinos when he was nine years old. He attended Ambler Primary School in Islington and Woodberry Down Comprehensive School in Manor House, where he battled with dyslexia, but began his entrepreneurial activities by running the school's tuck shop at the age of 15.\n\nPaphitis took a job as a tea boy and filing clerk at a City of London insurance broker. Wanting more money, he discovered his passion for retailing and sales when at 18 he worked as a sales assistant for Watches of Switzerland in Bond Street.\n\nAged 21, he joined Legal & General selling commercial mortgages, which taught him to read other businesses' balance sheets.\n\nAged 23, he set up a property finance company with close friend and business associate Mark Moran, and kept going when the friend left in partnership with Hanover Druce, making his first money on the rise of the 1980s commercial property markets. Spotting the rise in mobile telephones, he bought into NAG Telecom, becoming chairman alongside fellow director Tony Kleanthous. Paphitis gained a large market share for NAG by negotiating concessionary positions in Ryman stationery stores.\n\nWhen Ryman went bankrupt, Paphitis approached the administrators and bought the company. He turned it around by improving relations with suppliers, and enthusing the management team, cementing his reputation for turning failing companies into highly successful and profitable businesses. His ventures now include Ryman, Robert Dyas and Boux Avenue. He co-owns Red Letter Days with fellow \"Dragons' Den\" businessman Peter Jones. In 2006, he sold his equity stake in the UK and EU segment of the global lingerie brand, La Senza, for a reported £100m.\n\nIn 2008, Paphitis was one of several interested parties in bidding for failed retail chain Woolworths. However he later pulled out because of unrealistic numbers quoted by the administrators.\n\nIn March 2011, Paphitis set up a new lingerie chain, Boux Avenue which by the end of 2013 had grown to 21 stores in the UK with a further four internationally.\n\nIn July 2012, he bought the hardware retailer Robert Dyas. Paphitis said: \"It is a business which fits well with my investment criteria.\"\n\nAs chairman from 1997, Paphitis took Millwall out of administration and on to the 2004 FA Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium. He is perhaps best known for his work to reduce football hooliganism, and appointing as Millwall manager Dennis Wise, and together they guided the club to their first official appearance in the final of the FA Cup and into European football. After almost eight years at the helm of Millwall, Paphitis stepped down from his role as chairman in 2005.\n\nPaphitis is a director and part-owner of Isthmian League side Walton & Hersham. Paphitis' other companies became sponsors of the League's cup competitions with Robert Dyas sponsoring cup tournaments. Boux Avenue became title sponsor of the Boux Avenue Women's Cup.\n\nAfter appearing on series four of the BBC \"Back to the Floor\" series while chairman at Millwall FC, Paphitis was approached to become one of the \"dragons\" in the second series of the BBC Two entrepreneurship series \"Dragons' Den\" in 2005 and left the programme after the 2012 season.\nPaphitis was known as a straight-talking but approachable and sincere 'dragon' who made many investments on the show, both alone and jointly with other dragon investors. In February 2013, he announced that he would be leaving the show.\n\nIn 2010, Paphitis had a three-part television series on BBC Two called \"Theo's Adventure Capitalists\". The series followed British businesses looking to enter new markets in Brazil, India and Vietnam. The series was supported by the Open University.\n\nIn 2011, Paphitis presented the seven-part BBC Two series called \"Britain's Next Big Thing\". The series examined the stories of artists, scientists, manufacturers and brand owners looking to sell their products and services to UK retailers including Boots and Liberty.\n\nAfter time away from television to concentrate on business, Paphitis returned with appearances on BBC's \"Question Time\" and ITV's \"The Agenda\". In March 2014, he appeared in \"Famous, Rich and Hungry\", a two-part BBC documentary series which aimed to promote awareness of British people living in poverty, and raise money for Sport Relief.\n\nPaphitis lives with his wife Debbie in Weybridge, Surrey. They have two sons and three daughters, including twins, and four grandchildren.\n\nPaphitis attributes his success to his natural common sense, and his favourite motto is a famous business school motto: \"KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid\". He has said, \"There are three reasons to be in business. To make money, to have fun, and to make money.\"\n\nPaphitis is a keen fan of cars. His car collection has a series of personalised number plates, including RYM4N on his Maybach. On 13 June 2017, the burglar who stole Paphitis' Land Rover received a jail sentence of two and a half years.\n\nPaphitis has been criticised for some of his views on women. In 2008, he was quoted by Kira Cochrane of \"The Guardian\" newspaper as saying that although women may refuse to take maternity leave, \"their brains turn to mush\" after the pregnancy and \"they take three months off\".\n\nPaphitis voted for Brexit in 2016, describing the EU as a \"failed experiment\".\n\n"}

{"id": "313155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313155", "title": "Till Eulenspiegel", "text": "Till Eulenspiegel\n\nTill Eulenspiegel (, Low German: \"Dyl Ulenspegel\" ) is the protagonist of a German chapbook published in 1515 (a first edition of c. 1510/12 is preserved fragmentarily) with a possible background in earlier Middle Low German folklore.\n\nEulenspiegel is a native of Brunswick whose picaresque career \ntakes him to many places throughout the Holy Roman Empire. \nHe plays practical jokes on his contemporaries, especially scatological in nature, exposing vices at every turn.\nHis life is set in the first half of the 14th century, and the final chapters of the chapbook describe his death from the plague of 1350.\nHis name translates to \"owl mirror\", and the frontispiece of the 1515 chapbook, as well as his alleged tombstone in Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein, display the name in rebus writing, by an owl and a hand mirror. There is a suggestion that the name is in fact a veiled pun on a Low German phrase translating to \"wipe-arse\".\n\nRetellings of the Eulenspiegel tradition have been published in modern literature, since the later 19th century. Notably, \"The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak\" by Charles De Coster (1867) transfers the character to the context of the Protestant Reformation and the Dutch Revolt. The Ulenspiegel (modern Dutch: \"Tijl Uilenspiegel\") from this novel became a symbol of Flemish independence.\n\nAccording to the chapbook, Eulenspiegel was born in Kneitlingen near Brunswick around 1300. As a vagrant (\"Landfahrer\"), he travelled through the Holy Roman Empire, especially Northern Germany, but also the Low Countries, Bohemia, and Italy. \nHe is said to have died in Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein, near Lübeck and Hamburg, of the Black Death in 1350.\n\nThe first known chapbook on Eulenspiegel was printed in c. 1510–1512 in Strasbourg. It is reasonable to place the folkloristic origins of the tradition in the 15th century, although, in spite of often-repeated suggestions to the effect \"that the name 'Eulenspiegel' was used in tales of rogues and liars in Lower Saxony as early as 1400\", 15th-century references to a Till Eulenspiegel turn out to be surprisingly elusive. \nThe text of the first extant edition, printed by Johannes Grüninger, is in the High German language. \nThere has been a debate surrounding the possible existence of an older Low German edition, now lost.\nThis version has been attributed to Hans Dorn, the only known printer active in Brunswick at the beginning of the 16th century (active from at least 1502). Sodmann (1980) in support of this hypothesis adduced the woodcut of a fool on horseback holding a hand mirror used by Dorn in later prints, as the title illustration of his \"Liber vagatorum\" and \"Grobianus\", which may originally have served as the title illustration of the lost Eulenspiegel edition.\n\nThere are several suggestions as to the author of the 1510 chapbook, none of which has gained mainstream acceptance. \nCandidates include Thomas Murner, Hermann Bote, Hieronymus Brunschwig, or an author collective surrounding Johannes Grüninger, including Thomas Murner, Johannes Adelphus, Tilemann Conradi and Hermannus Buschius.\nThe author of the 1515 edition in a short preface identifies himself only as \"N\". He gives the year 1500 as the date when he originally began to collect the tales, stressing the difficulty of the project and how he wanted to abandon it several times, saying that he is now publishing it after all to \"lighten the mood in hard times\". The preface also announces the inclusion of material from Pfaff Amis and Pfaff vom Kahlenberg, but no such material is present in the 1515 edition.\nThe literal translation of the High German name \"Eulenspiegel\" is \"owl mirror\" (hence \"owle-glasse\"). It is both innocuous and indicative of his character and has been explained as a garbled form of an expression for \"wipe-the-arse\": \n\nDespite of the name's High German meaning, the book's hero acts out the Plattdeutsch version of his name: ulen, \"to sweep\" or \"clean\", and Spiegel, \"mirror\", which - to the very day - is German speaking hunter's jargon for \"hind parts\" or \"backside\", so that in the original Plattdeutsch, his surname means \"wipe my a*se\", in essence, \"kiss my a*se\".\n\nMany of Till's pranks are scatological in nature, and involve tricking people into touching, smelling, or even eating Till's excrement.\nScatological stories abound, beginning with Till's early childhood (in which he rides behind his father and exposes his rear-end to the townspeople) and persisting until his death bed (where he tricks a priest into soiling his hands with feces).\n\nIn modern scholarship, there have been some attempts to find evidence for the historicity of Till Eulenspiegel's person. \nHucker (1980) mentions that according to a contemporary legal register of the city of Brunswick one \"Till van Cletlinge\" (\"Till from/of Kneitlingen\") was incarcerated there in the year 1339, along with four of his accomplices, for highway robbery.\nIn Mölln, the reported site of Eulenspiegel's death and burial in the plague year of 1350, a memorial stone was commissioned by the town council in 1544, now on display in an alcove on the outside wall of the tower of St. Nicolai church. The stone is inscribed in Low German, as follows:\nThe inscription (including the date of 1350) was allegedly copied from an older tombstone, now lost. This older tombstone is referred to in the chapbook of 1515, and it is mentioned as still being extant in 1536.\nThe 1544 stone is mentioned by Fynes Moryson in his \"Itinerary\" of 1591.\nMoryson also reports that in his time, the citizen of Mölln held a yearly festival in Eulenspiegel's honour, on which occasion they would present the clothes worn by Eulenspiegel when he died.\n\nThe two earliest printed editions, in Early New High German, were printed by Johannes Grüninger in Strasbourg. The first edition was unknown before sixteen folia of printing proofs \nwere discovered in 1971 in the binding of a Latin edition of Reynard.\nHonegger () dated these pages to 1510/11 based on the type used, but this date has since been called into question. \nOnly a single specimen of the first edition has been preserved, discovered in 1975. Thirty folia are missing, including the title page. \nA previous owner has replaced the missing pages by pages torn from an Eulenspiegel edition of c. 1700.\nIt was most likely published in 1512. The sixteen folia discovered by Honegger are likely printing proofs for this edition.\nIt consists of 100 folia with 66 woodcuts of high quality.\n\nThe 1515 edition was also printed by Grüninger in Strasbourg. Its full title reads:\nThe text is divided into 95 chapters (numbered to 96 as chapter number 42 is missing).\nThe 1515 edition is decidedly inferior, missing many of the illustrations of the older edition, and showing signs of careless copying of the text.\nIt is uncertain how many of these chapters were present in the earlier edition of 1510/12, although some of the chapters appear to be later additions. The initials of the final six chapters form the \"acrostic\" \"ERMANB\", which has been taken as a hidden reference to the book's author.\nThe first chapters are dedicated to Till's childhood. In chapter nine, Till leaves his mother and begins his life as a vagrant. He takes up diverse occupations, but each chapter ends with his moving on to another place.\nThe final seven chapters are dedicated to his death and burial.\n\nIn the chapbooks, Eulenspiegel is presented as a trickster who plays practical jokes on his contemporaries, exposing vices at every turn, greed and folly, hypocrisy and foolishness. As Peter Carels notes, \"The fulcrum of his wit in a large number of the tales is his literal interpretation of figurative language.\" (Previously, Goethe made a similar observation.) Although craftsmen are featured as the principal victims of his pranks, neither the nobility nor the pope is exempt from being affected by him.\n\nA third Strasbourg edition, of 1519, is better again and is usually used in modern editions to provide the sections that are missing in the surviving 1510/12 copy.\n\nThe \"Antwerp group\" of Eulenspiegel editions comprises a number of Flemish, French and English publications. It is only slightly younger than the Strasbourg editions, these books were probably printed from before 1520, first in Antwerp by Jan van Doesborch.\nIt is possible that the first English translation was printed by van Doesborch as early as 1520. In this edition the name \"Ulenspiegel\" is rendered \"Howleglas\" (as it were \"owl-glass\").\nLater English editions, derived from the Antwerp group, were printed by William Copland in London, in 1547 and 1568.\n\n\"Owleglasse\" is mentioned in Henry Porter's \"The Two Angry Women of Abington\" (1599) and again in Ben Jonson's comedic play \"The Alchemist\" (1610).\n\nThe first modern edition of the chapbook of 1519 is by Lappenberg (1854). Lappenberg was not yet aware of the existence of the 1515 edition.\nThe 1515 and 1519 editions were published in facsimile by Insel-Ferlag in 1911 and 1979, respectively.\nAn English translation by Paul Oppenheimer was published in 1972.\n\nEditions of Eulenspiegel in German, Dutch, Flemish, French and English remained popular throughout the early modern period. By the late 17th century, Eulenspiegel and his pranks had become proverbial, with the French adjective \"espiègle\" \"impish, mischievous\" derived from his name.\nThe German noun \"Eulenspiegelei\" (as it were \"owlglassery\") is recorded in the early 19th century.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, German satirists adopted episodes for social satire, and in the nineteenth and early twentieth-century versions of the tales are bowdlerized, to render them fit for children, who had come to be considered their chief natural audience, by expurgating their many scatological references.\n\n\"The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak\", an 1867 novel by Belgian author Charles De Coster, has been translated, often in mutilated versions, into many languages. \nIt was De Coster who first transferred Ulenspiegel from his original late medieval surroundings to the Protestant Reformation. In this version, Ulenspiegel was born in Damme, West Flanders and became a Protestant hero of the Dutch Revolt. The author gives him a father, Claes, and mother, Soetkin, as well as a girlfriend, Nele, and a best friend, Lamme Goedzak. In the course of the story Claes is taken prisoner by the Spanish oppressors and burned at the stake, while Soetkin goes insane as a result. This tempts Thyl to start resistance against the Spanish oppressors. Thanks to the 1867 novel, Ulenspiegel has become a symbol of Flemish nationalism, with a statue dedicated to him in Damme.\n\nRichard Strauss wrote the tone poem \"Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche\", Op. 28, in 1894-1895.\nIn 1902 Emil von Reznicek adapted the story into an opera: \"Till Eulenspiegel\". In 1913 Walter Braunfels adapted the story into an opera \"Ulenspiegel\". The Ballets Russes adapted the story into a ballet in 1916, later re-adapted by George Balanchine for Jerome Robbins at New York City Ballet.\n\nA French edition, \"Les Aventures de Til Ulespiègle\", was published by Constantin Castéra in 1910.\nIn 1927 Gerhart Hauptmann wrote the verse \"Till Eulenspiegel\".\nDutch comics artist George van Raemdonck adapted the novel into a comic strip in the 1920s. In the 1940s Ray Goossens made a gag-a-day comic about Uilenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak. \nWladimir Vogel was a Russian composer who wrote a drama-oratorio Thyl Claes in the late 30s or early 40s, derived from De Coster's book.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1950 a German satirical magazine was called \"Ulenspiegel\".\nThe satirical magazine \"Eulenspiegel\" was published from 1954 in Berlin, East Germany.\nUlenspiegel was mentioned in Mikhail Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\" as a possible prototype for the black cat character Behemoth.\nIn 1956 the film \"Les Aventures de Till L'Espiègle\" was made by Gérard Philipe and Joris Ivens, which adapted De Coster's novel. (English title: \"Bold Adventure\"). The film was a French-East German co-production.\n\nWilly Vandersteen drew two comic book albums about Uilenspiegel, \"De Opstand der Geuzen\" (\"The Rebellion of the Geuzen\") and \"Fort Oranje\" (\"Fort Orange\"), both drawn in a realistic, serious style and pre-published in the Belgian comics magazine \"Tintin\" between 1952 and 1954. They were published in comic book album format in 1954 and 1955. The stories were drawn in a realistic style and in some instances followed the original novel very closely, but sometimes followed his own imagination more.\nKibbutz theatre director and producer Shulamit Bat-Dori created an open-air production of \"Till Eulenspiegel\" at Mishmar HaEmek, Israel, in 1955 that drew 10,000 viewers.\n\nIn 1961 the BRT (nowadays the VRT) made a children's TV series, \"Tijl Uilenspiegel\".\nIn 1973 Walter van der Kamp directed \"Uilenspiegel\", a Dutch film.\nRainer Simon directed \"Tijl Eulenspiegel\" in 1975, which was an East-German production.\n\"Ulenspiegel (Legenda o Tile)\", was a 1976 Soviet film, based on De Coster's novel, and directed by Aleksandr Alov and Vladimir Naumov, \"The Legend of Till Ullenspiegel\" (1976).\nThe Soviet composer Nikolai Karetnikov and his librettist filmmaker Pavel Lungin adapted De Coster's novel as the samizdat opera \"Till Eulenspiegel\" (1983), which had to be recorded piece-by-piece in secret and received its premiere (1993) only after the Soviet Union collapsed.\n\nMichael Rosen adapted the story into a 1989 children's novel, illustrated by Fritz Wegner: \"The Wicked Tricks of Till Owlyglass\", .\nIn 2003 Eberhard Junkersdorf adapted the story into a feature-length animated film.\nIn 2014 Christian Theede directed the film \"Till Eulenspiegel\".\nClive Barker incorporated elements of the Till Eulenspiegel story in his play \"Crazyface\".\n\nDaniel Kehlmann in his novel \"Tyll\" (2017) places Tyll \"Ulenspiegel\" in the context of the Thirty Years' War.\n\nThere are three museums in Germany featuring Till Eulenspiegel. One is located in the town of Schöppenstedt in Lower Saxony, which is nearby his assumed birthplace Kneitlingen. \nThe second is located in the supposed place of his death, the city of Mölln in Schleswig-Holstein, and the third in Bernburg (Saale), Sachsen-Anhalt. In the town of Damme, Belgium, there is also a museum honoring him, and there is a fountain and statue featuring Till Eulenspiegel in the Marktplatz of Magdeburg, capital city of Sachsen-Anhalt.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n"}

She is the only Bond girl to actually marry 007. In the film version, Tracy is played by actress Diana Rigg.\n\nBorn Teresa Draco in 1943, she is the only child of Marc-Ange Draco, the head of the Union Corse, a powerful Corsican crime syndicate – not quite as large as SPECTRE, but with substantially larger \"legal\" operations, including Draco Construction. Teresa goes by \"Tracy\" because she feels \"Teresa\" does not suit her (as she introduced herself to Bond, \"Teresa is a saint; I'm known as Tracy\").\n\nTracy's mother died in 1955; her father then sent her to a boarding school in Switzerland. Deprived of a stable home life, Tracy joined the \"international fast set\", committing \"one scandal after another\"; when Draco cut off her allowance, Tracy committed \"a greater folly\" out of spite. She later married Italian Count Giulio di Vicenzo who, during their marriage, got hold of a large portion of her money before eventually leaving her; he subsequently died while driving a Maserati in the company of one of his mistresses. During this marriage, Tracy had a child, who later died of spinal meningitis.\nDesperate with grief for her child, Tracy attempted suicide by walking into the sea in Portugal, only to be saved by James Bond.\n\nWhen her father meets Bond, he pleads with Bond to continue to see her, claiming that their relationship had changed her for the better. Bond initially refuses, but he changes his mind when Marc-Ange offers his resources for anything Bond desires. Since the events of \"Thunderball\" and the demise of SPECTRE, Bond had been hunting for Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and at one point was willing to retire from MI6 because he felt the hunt was folly and that his services and abilities could be used better. Using Draco's resources, however, Bond is able to track Blofeld to Switzerland. In return, Bond continues to see Tracy and eventually falls in love with her. Tragedy strikes on their wedding day, however, when Blofeld and his henchwoman Irma Bunt shoot at Bond and Tracy in a drive-by shooting. Tracy is shot in the head and killed.\n\nIn the film, Tracy drives a red 1969 model Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible.\n\nIn Fleming's novels, Bond is a broken man after Tracy's death. In \"You Only Live Twice\", he has begun drinking heavily, which has affected his work; M is forced to acknowledge that he is no longer fit for service. However he decides to give Bond one last chance and assigns him to an intelligence-related diplomatic affair in Japan. This in turn leads to a duel to the death with Blofeld in the climax of the novel, and Bond is finally awarded his revenge. In the aftermath, however, he is left with amnesia.\n\nIn the films, James Bond is tracking Blofeld in the pre-title credits sequence of \"Diamonds Are Forever\". The film does not explain why nor does it mention Tracy. Originally, it had been planned that \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" would end with Bond and Tracy driving away from their wedding. The scenes where she was shot were filmed at the same time with the intention that they would form the pre-title sequence of \"Diamonds Are Forever\". This was rendered inviable when George Lazenby left the role.\n\nSubsequent films reference the fact that Bond was previously married, but only fleetingly:\n\n\n\n\nTracy's wedding dress is now kept at the Admiral Hotel in Milan, along with a big collection of \"James Bond\" and \"Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang\" items.\n"}
