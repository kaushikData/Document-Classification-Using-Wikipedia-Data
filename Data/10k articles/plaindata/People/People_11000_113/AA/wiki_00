In 1909, during the beginning revolution in Mexico, he joined the Partido Antirreeleccionista (Anti-Reelection party), and supported Francisco I. Madero. In 1913 he fought in the rank of a second lieutenant under General Cándido Aguilar (División de Oriente) against Victoriano Huerta, who substituted him temporarily as military commander and as governor of Veracruz in 1915. On June 30, 1917, in the rank of a Brigadier General, he followed Carlos Tejada as Governor of the State of Mexico, supported by the Club Democrático Progresista. During this period, he was two times absent because of military reasons. The first time, Joaquín García Luna acted in place of him from September 6, 1918, to March 4, 1919.

Born in New Hampshire, United States and raised primarily in Quebec, Canada, she has written and directed many National Film Board of Canada documentaries on First Nations issues.\n\nObomsawin's described \"the basic purpose [of my films] is for our people to have a voice[...] no matter what we're talking about whether it has to do with having our existence recognised, or whether it has to do with speaking about our values, our survival, our beliefs, that we belong to something beautiful, that it's O.K. to be an Indian, to be a native person in this country.\" Her best known documentary is \"\", about the 1990 Oka Crisis, Quebec.\n\nObomsawin was born in New Hampshire on Abenaki Territory. When she was six months old, her mother returned to the Odanak reserve north east of Montreal where she lived until she was 7. During this period she lived with her mother's sister Jesse Benedict and her husband Levi who had six children of their own. Théophile Panadis, her mother's cousin, initiated her into the history of the Abenaki Nation and taught her many songs and legends. Obomsawin and her parents then left Odanak for Trois-Rivières, where they were the only Native family. Cut off, speaking little French and no English, Obomsawin held fast to the songs and stories she had learned on the reserve.\n\nAfter moving to Montreal in the late 1950s, having learned English during a two-year stay in Florida, she performed as a singer and a storyteller, making appearances on reservations, in prisons and schools, and at music festivals. She has one child, Kisos Obomsawin, born in 1969.\n\nObomsawin directed her first documentary for the NFB, \"Christmas at Moose Factory\", in 1971. As of August 2017, she has directed 50 films with the NFB, with her documentary film \"Our People Will Be Healed\", about the Helen Betty Osborne Ininiw Education Resource Centre in Norway House Cree Nation, premiering in the Masters programme of the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nHer previous film was the 2016 documentary \"We Can't Make the Same Mistake Twice\", exploring a human rights complaint filed against the Canadian government over discrimination against First Nation children, which had its world premiere on September 13 at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nObomsawin's 2014 documentary \"Trick or Treaty?\" was the first film by an indigenous filmmaker to screen in the Masters programme at the Toronto International Film Festival. Obomsawin began conceptualizing the film in 2010 when she was invited by Stan Louttit, Grand Chief of the Mushkegowuk Council, to film a conference the band was hosting about Treaty No. 9.\n\nObomsawin's 2013 documentary \"Hi-Ho Mistahey!\", about Shannen Koostachin, a First Nations education activist, premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nHer 2012 documentary \"The People of the Kattawapiskak River\" on the Attawapiskat housing crisis was conceived when Obomsawin was present in the community in 2011, working on another film for the NFB.\n\nIn 2010, she completed a short drama \"When All the Leaves are Gone\", about her experiences attending public school in Quebec.\n\nIn 2009, she completed the documentary \"Professor Norman Cornett: \"Since when do we divorce the right answer from an honest answer?\" looking at the dismissal of unorthodox McGill University religious studies lecturer Norman Cornett, which will have its world premiere at the Hot Docs film festival.\n\nObomsawin's recent credits include \"Gene Boy Came Home,\" about Aboriginal Vietnam War veteran Eugene Benedict. In 2006, she completed \"WABAN-AKI: People from Where the Sun Rises\" a look at the people and stories from her home reserve of Odanak. In 2005, Ms Obomsawin completed her short drama \"Sigwan\", following a young girl who is aided by the animals of the forest. Her 2003 NFB documentary \"Our Nationhood\", chronicles the determination and tenacity of the Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation to use and manage the natural resources of their traditional lands. The Mi'gmaq of Esgenoopetitj (Burnt Church), New Brunswick were the subject of her 2002 documentary, \"Is the Crown at war with us?\", exploring a conflict with the Department of Fisheries and non-native fishers over fishing rights.\n\nThe 2000 NFB release \"Rocks at Whiskey Trench\" was Obomsawin's fourth film in her series about the 1990 Oka crisis. The first, \"\" (1993), was a feature-length film documenting the 1990 Mohawk uprising in Kanehsatake and Oka, which has won 18 international awards. It was followed by \"My Name is Kahentiiosta\" (1995), a film about a young Kahnawake Mohawk woman who was arrested after the 78-day armed standoff, and \"Spudwrench – Kahnawake Man\" (1997), profiling Randy Horne, a high-steel worker from the Mohawk community of Kahnawake. \nObomsawin's films also include: \"Incident at Restigouche\" (1984), a powerful depiction of the Quebec police raid of a Micmac reserve; \"\" (1986), the disturbing examination of an adolescent suicide; \"No Address\" (1988), a look at Montreal's homeless; as well as \"Mother of Many Children\" (1977).\n\nObomsawin first came to the attention of the NFB in the mid-1960s, when she held fundraising concerts to pay for the construction of a swimming pool in Odanak. Children in her community were no longer able to swim in the Saint Francis River, but were not allowed to use a pool in a neighbouring community, which was for white residents only. Obomsawin's success in raising funds for a construction of a pool for Odanak children was interviewed about it by the CBC-TV's \"Telescope\" series, which was seen by NFB producers Joe Koenig and Bob Verrall.\n\n\"It was from there the National Film Board (NFB) saw it and I was invited by some producers to talk to some of the filmmakers there,\" said Obomsawin. \"I discovered that they had a studio that only catered to [the] classroom, with educational film strips.\"\n\nThey invited the singer/storyteller to the Film Board to work as an advisor on a film about Aboriginal people. She went on to direct films of her own, while continuing to perform and fight for justice for her people.\n\nObomsawin is a member of Film Fatales independent women filmmakers.\n\nIn 1960, Obomsawin made her professional debut as a singer-songwriter in New York City.

She also managed her own stage at the Mariposa Folk Festival in the 1960s. Her 1988 album \"Bush Lady\" featured traditional songs of the Abenaki people, as well as original compositions.\n\nFor over 25 years, Obomsawin has worked as an engraver and printmaker, with exhibitions in Canada and Europe. Mother and child imagery is prominent in her work, which also combines material from her own dreams with animal spirits and historical events. Her work was exhibited at the Maison Lacombe in Quebec in 2007.\n\nIn May 2017 Obomsawin received an honorary doctorate from McGill University's School of Continuing Studies. That same month, she was named a Commander in the newly created Order of Montreal, recognizing individuals who have contributed to the development of Montreal.

She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nAnn Bancroft was born in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, and grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota. Bancroft spent two years in Kenya in her fifth and sixth grades. Bancroft began leading wilderness expeditions when she was 8-years-old when she convinced her cousins to join her on backyard expeditions. She described her family as one of risk takers. Bancroft struggled with dyslexia from an early age, but she nevertheless graduated High School and was accepted at the University of Oregon where she graduated with a Physical Education Degree in 1981. Bancroft was a camper and staff member at YMCA Camp Widjiwagan in Ely, MN. Bancroft also taught Physical Education and Special Education in St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Bancroft became a wilderness instructor and a gym teacher in Minneapolis (at Clara Barton Open School) and St. Paul.\n\nAnn Bancroft founded the Ann Bancroft Foundation in 1991. The Ann Bancroft foundation supports the Wilderness Inquiry group and Bancroft currently teaches at Wilderness Inquiry. The Wilderness Inquiry group allows individuals and families to go on outdoor adventures, and the adventures are open to people of all ability levels. Bancroft currently co-owns an exploration company, Bancroft Arnesen Explore, with Liv Arnesen. Bancroft has been on expeditions on the Ganges River in India, crossed Greenland, traveled to the North Pole, and crossed the South Pole.\n\nBancroft gave up her physical education and special education teaching posts in 1986 in order to participate with the \"Will Steger International North Pole Expedition\". She arrived at the North Pole together with five other team members after 56 days using dogsleds. This made Bancroft the first woman to reach the North Pole on foot and by sled.\n\nShe was also the first woman to cross both polar ice caps to reach the North and South Poles, as well as the first woman to ski across Greenland. In 1992-1993, Bancroft led a four-woman expedition to the South Pole on skis; this expedition was the first all-female expedition to cross the ice to the South Pole.\n\nIn 2001, Ann and Norwegian adventurer Liv Arnesen became the first women to ski across Antarctica.\n\nIn March 2007, Bancroft and Liv Arnesen took part in a trek across the Arctic Ocean to draw attention to the problem of global warming. The two explorers were followed be millions of school children. However, according to \"The Washington Post\", the expedition was called off \"after Liv Arnesen suffered frostbite in three of her toes, and extreme cold temperatures drained the batteries in some of their electronic equipment.\"\n\nIn 2017, Bancroft led an expedition on the Ganges River as part of the \"Access Water Initiative Series.\" The Ganges River expedition's purpose was to raise awareness of the importance of clean water and that waste will travel downstream. This expedition was a 60-day trip on 1,500 miles of waterway.\n\nBancroft plans to boat down the Mississippi river in 2018 with Arnesen and other female explorers. Future expeditions will be conducted on every continent. This initiative aims to encourage children to protect their waterways, which is a vital resource. In 2018, Bancroft will paddle down the 2,320 mile Mississippi River. Future trips include Africa in 2019, Oceania in 2021, South America in 2023, Europe in 2025, and Antarctica in 2027.\n\nBancroft is openly gay and in 2006, she publicly campaigned against a proposed amendment to the Minnesota Constitution to prohibit any legal recognition of marriages or civil unions between members of the same sex.\n\nBancroft also supports awareness of Access Water, Winter Warm-Up challenges, and Global Warming\n\n\n\n"}

Murray described her character as...\nThe titular second episode of the first series and the penultimate episode of the second series focus on Cassie; the former focuses on her mental state and the latter focuses on her relationship with roommate Chris Miles (Joe Dempsie). The show's producers and writers described her centric episode in an interview with \"The Independent\" as being about \"how she gets through her day without eating ... how she feels and what her tactics are\", and campaigned to prevent any announcement of any counselling helplines during the episode's credits because they \"didn't want a little preachy drama where everyone hugs at the end\"; instead, the producers hoped that people would recognize their own faults in Cassie. One reviewer described Cassie as being \"as pale as \"Hamlet\"s Ophelia and arguably twice as mad\".\"\"'\n\nThe viewer is reintroduced to Cassie five years after series two in \"Pure\", in which she is shown to have changed in many ways. Where before she was bubbly, cheerful and unashamedly quirky, she is now a shadow of her former self, appearing tired and withdrawn, living in a shared flat in London and working as a waitress in a café to make ends meet. She avoids social contact with her co-workers and flatmates, and refuses to take drugs when offered them (as opposed to her affinity towards them in the past), and secludes herself in her room. There is (season 4 episode 2) a drawing which strongly resembles Cassie posted at the front of Sophia's room. This could be a joke made by the producers of the show.\n\nAt the beginning of the first series, Cassie is recently discharged from hospital after a suicide attempt off-screen. Her friend Michelle Richardson (April Pearson) arranges for her to take Sid Jenkins' (Mike Bailey) virginity at a party. The two talk and even briefly kiss, although Cassie reveals she took a \"shit load\" of pills and passes out. The gang leave the party in order to get her to the hospital, although as soon as Tony parks up, she regains consciousness.\n\nCassie's central episode develops her eating disorder; her sexually-stimulated parents are introduced, who are usually too busy having sex in order to pay attention to her issues. She informs them that it is her last clinic day. She is then picked up by the clinic taxi driver, Allan, with whom she seems to have a close relationship, and he promises not to tell anyone Cassie has put weights in her underwear in order to fool the clinic into thinking she has gained weight. She is sent to her final group therapy, where fellow patient Madison Twatter tells the group about a student named Sid Jenkins who has not paid him back for the drugs he supplied Sid with. \n\nIn college, Cassie runs into Sid at the canteen, and they talk. Having developed a crush on him on the previous episode, she reveals to him how she is able to get away with hiding the fact that she is not eating, but he is not impressed with it, and protests. When she states that \"no-one cares,\" he responds \"I care.\" Cassie also warns Sid that Mad also has his ID card. Throughout the episode, Cassie keeps seeing the word 'EAT!' on post-it notes, the plate of chips that Sid gives her and on text messages. This is implied to be a hallucination as when she asks Sid about it (assuming he sent the texts), Sid proves that he has not texted her. Cassie then calls Allan. She tells him someone keeps telling her to eat, and he suggests she is imagining the texts because she is mentally sending them to herself, because she wants to eat. Cassie gives in and eats a burger as the episode closes.\n\nIn \"Chris\", Cassie gives Sid more hints about her affection towards him and asks him on a date. However, in \"Sid\", he is grounded so Cassie tells him she will come over to his house. However, she is stood up due to Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) convincing Sid to accompany him and Michelle at his choir performance, and when Sid admits he was with Michelle, Cassie lashes out at him. Later on she attempts suicide by intaking a large amount of pills mixed with vodka. When Sid tries to visit her in hospital, Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson) forces him to leave. In \"Michelle\", Sid visits rehab in order to make amends with Cassie and she accepts his apology, but Sid is dismayed when she reveals has a boyfriend, Simon (James Buckley).\n\nIn \"Effy\", Sid calls her late at night after a fight with Tony and the two kiss. However, Sid stands her up again to rescue Tony and his sister Effy (Kaya Scodelario) from an overdose. In the finale, her parents move with her to Elgin, Scotland. She postpones her plans after discovering Sid loves her through a letter he wrote at the beginning of the episode, and the series ends with the pair holding hands on the same park bench Cassie attempted suicide on. It is implied that Sid lost his virginity to her at the start of the second series.\n\nIn the second series, Cassie is in a long-distance relationship with Sid; the relationship becomes strained when Sid begins to think Cassie has been unfaithful. He angrily accuses her of cheating, mistaking her closeness with her gay Scottish friend. Sid smashes his laptop in frustration and it is left ambiguous whether they have broken up or not, though the next morning, Cassie has blocked Sid's mobile number. After Sid's father Mark (Peter Capaldi) dies, Sid travels to Scotland to meet her as Cassie simultaneously travels back to Bristol to meet Sid. Frustrated at Cassie's disappearance and emotionally confused by his father's death, Sid begins a relationship with Michelle in the latter's central episode, after she finds him at the edge of a cliff, possibly to attempt suicide. However, Cassie catches them kissing in Sid's bedroom and keeps a cool head, although it is shown to have a huge impact on her in the next few episodes.\n\nAs a result of Sid's relationship with Michelle, Cassie becomes extremely promiscuous (with men and women) and mentally unstable: in \"Chris\", her actions result in her roommate Chris Miles (Joe Dempsie) losing his job as a junior property salesman and cause a significant amount of tension between him and his girlfriend Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson) after Angie, Chris' ex-girlfriend and psychology teacher returns to Bristol; and in \"Effy\", she attributes her addiction to \"mindless sex\" to her failed relationship with Sid. After Sid becomes aware of her actions, he confronts her about her promiscuity, apologises for dating Michelle, and tells her he loves her. They reconcile.\n\nCassie's subplot in Chris' last three episodes of series 2 focuses on her friendship with him. She witnesses Chris suffering from two subarachnoid haemorrhages, the second fatal, taking his life in Cassie's central episode. She is traumatized and flees to New York City. There, she meets a kind young Iowan named Adam (Stephen Michael Kane), with whom she forms a strong platonic friendship when he offers her a place to stay in his apartment. He later leaves the apartment to find his ex-girlfriend at Cassie's suggestion and, distraught, Cassie gets a job as a waitress at Adam's old diner in Manhattan. The ultimate scene of the second series depicts Sid wandering through Times Square looking for her and ends with him turning to look inside the diner.\n\nCassie is briefly referred to by Doug in series 6 when he mentions to Liv that he once danced for a girl to help her get through an exam, referring to Cassie's centric episode in the second series. However he does not mention her by name.\n\nCassie is revisited five years later in series 7 in a feature-length episode, \"Pure\". It is revealed that Sid did indeed find her and that the pair spent several years travelling around America, although she does not mention him by name. After ending the relationship, she moved back to England, though she moves into a shared flat in London instead of heading back to her hometown. She works as a waitress in a café, and later discovers a website titled 'Oblivion', filled with candid shots of her.\n\n"}

Among their most well-known designs is the Eames Lounge Chair. They also worked in the fields of industrial and graphic design, fine art, and film. Ray Kaiser Eames and Charles Eames worked together as creative partners.\n\nCharles Ormond Eames, Jr., (June 17, 1907 – August 21, 1978) was an American designer, architect and film maker. In creative partnership with his spouse Ray Kaiser Eames he is responsible for groundbreaking contributions in the field of architecture, furniture design, industrial design, manufacturing and the photographic arts. He briefly studied architecture at Washington University in St. Louis on an architecture scholarship. After two years of study, he left the university. Many sources claim that he was dismissed for his advocacy of Frank Lloyd Wright and his interest in modern architects. The university reportedly dropped him because of his \"too modern\" views. Other sources, less frequently cited, note that while a student, Charles Eames also was employed as an architect at the firm of Trueblood and Graf. The demands on his time from this employment and from his classes led to sleep-deprivation and diminished performance at the university.\n\nWhile at Washington University, he met his first wife, Catherine Woermann, whom he married in 1929. A year later, they had a daughter, Lucia Jenkins.\n\nIn 1930, Charles began his own architectural practice in St. Louis with partner Charles Gray. They were later joined by a third partner, Walter Pauley.\n\nCharles Eames was greatly influenced by the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen (whose son Eero, also an architect, would become a partner and friend). At the elder Saarinen's invitation, Charles moved in 1938 with his wife Catherine and daughter Lucia to Michigan, to further study architecture at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he would become a teacher and head of the industrial design department. In order to apply for the Architecture and Urban Planning Program, Eames defined an area of focus—the St. Louis waterfront. Together with Eero Saarinen he designed prize-winning furniture for New York's Museum of Modern Art \"Organic Design in Home Furnishings\" competition. Their work displayed the new technique of wood moulding (originally developed by Alvar Aalto), that Eames would further develop in many moulded plywood products, including chairs and other furniture, splints and stretchers for the US Navy during World War II.\n\nIn 1941, Charles and Catherine divorced, and he married his Cranbrook colleague Bernice (\"Ray\") Kaiser, who was born in Sacramento, California. He then moved with her to Los Angeles, California, where they worked and lived until their deaths. In the late 1940s, as part of the \"Arts & Architecture\" magazine's \"Case Study\" program, the Eameses designed and built the groundbreaking Eames House, Case Study House #8, as their home. Located upon a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and hand-constructed within a matter of days entirely of pre-fabricated steel parts intended for industrial construction, it remains a milestone of modern architecture.\n\nCharles Eames died of a heart attack on August 21, 1978, while on a consulting trip in his native Saint Louis, and was buried in the Calvary Cemetery there. He now has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971, Charles Eames gave the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University. At the lectures, the Eames viewpoint and philosophy are related through Charles' own telling of what he called \"the banana leaf parable\", a banana leaf being the most basic eating utensil in southern India. He related the progression of design and its process where the banana leaf is transformed into something fantastically ornate. He explains the next step and ties it to the design process by finishing the parable with:\nRay-Bernice Alexandra Kaiser Eames, née Kaiser (December 15, 1912 – August 21, 1988), was an American artist, designer, and filmmaker. In creative partnership with her spouse Charles Eames she was responsible for groundbreaking contributions in the field of architecture, furniture design, industrial design, manufacturing and the photographic arts. She was born in Sacramento, California to Alexander and Edna Burr Kaiser, and had a brother named Maurice. She spent her early childhood years with her parents in their apartment, and then moved to a bungalow outside of the town. Her parents taught her the quality of enjoyment which later led to inventions in furniture design and toys. Her parents also instilled the value of enjoyment of nature. After having lived in a number of cities during her youth and after her father's death, in 1933 she graduated from Bennett Women's College in Millbrook, New York, and moved to New York City, where she studied abstract expressionist painting with Hans Hofmann. She was a founder of the American Abstract Artists group in 1936 and displayed paintings in their first show a year later in 1937 at Riverside Museum in Manhattan. One of her paintings is in the permanent collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art. Ray lived alone in New York City until she was called home to be with her ailing mother, who died in 1940.\n\nIn September 1940, Ben Baldwin, an architect and friend, recommended that she should begin studies at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. She learned a variety of arts, not limiting herself to abstract painting. She worked with Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Charles Eames, and others on the display panels for the exhibition \"Organic Design in Home Furnishings\" at Museum of Modern Art. Ray married Charles Eames in 1941. Settling in Los Angeles, California, Charles and Ray Eames began an outstanding career in design and architecture.\n\nThe design process between Ray and Charles was strongly collaborative. After marriage the couple moved to California to continue their molded plywood furniture design and, in a later period, plastic. The graphic and commercial artwork can be clearly attributed to Ray, she designed twenty-six cover designs for the journal Arts & Architecture during 1942 to 1948, and a major part of the Eames furniture advertisements at Herman Miller (since 1948).\n\nIn the late 1940s, Ray Eames created several textile designs, two of which, \"Crosspatch\" and \"Sea Things\", were produced by Schiffer Prints, a company that also produced textiles by Salvador Dalí and Frank Lloyd Wright. Two of her textile patterns were distinguished with awards in a textile competition (organized by MoMa). She worked on graphics for advertising, magazine covers, posters, timelines, game boards, invitations and business cards. Original examples of Ray Eames textiles can be found in many art museum collections. The Ray Eames textiles have been re-issued by Maharam as part of their Textiles of the Twentieth Century collection.\n\nAfter Charles's death in 1978, the Eames Office was disbanded. Ray Eames worked on several unfinished projects (e.g. a German version of the \"Mathematica\" exhibition), was a consultant to IBM, published books, and administered the Eames archive and estate.\n\nRay Eames died in Los Angeles in 1988, ten years to the day after Charles. They are buried next to each other in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.\n\nRay Eames had a joyful and rigorous work ethic at the \"Eames office\". She called it \"shop\"- a place where they worked and did early production work. At the office, they employed local people, war veterans, and housewives. Eames office was a diversified workplace. The Eameses also believed in \"learning by doing\"- before introducing a new idea at the Eames Office, Charles and Ray explored needs and constraints of the idea extensively.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Eameses continued their work in architecture and modern furniture design. As with their earlier molded plywood work, the Eameses pioneered technologies, such as fiberglass furniture, plastic resin chairs, and the wire mesh chairs designed for Herman Miller. From the beginning, the Eames furniture has usually been listed as by Charles Eames. In the 1948 and 1952 Herman Miller bound catalogs, only Charles' name is listed, but it has become clear that Ray was deeply involved and was an equal partner with her husband in many projects. In August 2005 Maharam fabrics reissued Eames designed fabrics; Sea Things (1947) pattern and Dot Pattern. Dot Pattern was conceived for The Museum of Modern Art’s “Competition for Printed Fabrics” in 1947. The Eames fabrics were mostly designed by Ray, as were the Time-Life Stools. In 1979, the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded Charles and Ray with the Royal Gold Medal. At the time of Charles' death they were working on what became their last production, the Eames Sofa, which went into production in 1984.\n\nCharles and Ray channeled Charles' interest in photography into the production of 125 short films. From their first film, the unfinished \"Traveling Boy\" (1950), to \"Powers of Ten\" (re-released in 1977), to their last film in 1982, their cinematic work was an outlet for ideas, a vehicle for experimentation and education. The couple often produced short films in order to document their interests, such as collecting toys and cultural artifacts on their travels. The films also record the process of hanging their exhibits or producing classic furniture designs. Some of their other films cover more intellectual topics. For example, one film covers the purposely mundane topic of filming soap suds moving over the pavement of a parking lot. \"Powers of Ten\" (narrated by physicist Philip Morrison), gives a dramatic demonstration of orders of magnitude by visually zooming away from the earth to the edge of the universe, and then microscopically zooming into the nucleus of a carbon atom.\n\nThe Eameses also conceived and designed a number of exhibitions. The first of these, \"\" (1961), was sponsored by IBM, and is the only one of their exhibitions still extant. The \"Mathematica\" exhibition is still considered a model for science popularization exhibitions. It was followed by \"A Computer Perspective: Background to the Computer Age\" (1971) and \"The World of Franklin and Jefferson\" (1975–1977), among others.\n\nThe design office of Charles and Ray Eames functioned for more than four decades (1943–1988) in the former Bay Cities Garage at 901 Washington Boulevard in Venice, Los Angeles, California. Through the years, its staff included many notable designers: Henry Beer and Richard Foy, now co-chairmen of CommArts, Inc.; Don Albinson; Deborah Sussman; Annette Del Zoppo; Peter Jon Pearce; Harry Bertoia; and Gregory Ain, who was Chief Engineer for the Eameses during World War II.\n\nEames products were also manufactured on Washington Boulevard until the 1950s. Among the many important designs originating there are the molded-plywood DCW (Dining Chair Wood) and DCM (Dining Chair Metal with a plywood seat) (1945); Eames Lounge Chair (1956); the Aluminum Group furniture (1958); the Eames Chaise (1968), designed for Charles's friend, film director Billy Wilder; the playful Do-Nothing Machine (1957), an early solar energy experiment; and a number of toys.\n\nIn 1943 Ray and Charles developed a leg splint. This was is response to medical officers serving in World War II combat zones reported the need for emergency transport splints. The Eameses created their splints from wood veneers, which they bonded together with a resin glue and shaped into compound curves using a process involving heat and pressure. Using the material they had for the furniture in the guest bedroom of their apartment. With the introduction of plywood splints, they were able to replace problematic metal traction splints that had side effects of inducing gangrene due to impairment of blood circulation.\n\nArchitecture:\n\n- Meyer House, Huntleigh, Missouri, 1936-1938\n\n- St. Mary's Church, Helena, Arkansas, 1934\n\n- St. Mary’s Catholic Church, Paragould, Arkansas, 1935\n\n- Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Competition, 1947 (St. Louis Gateway Arch by Eero Saarinen won the competition)\n\n- Eames House, Case Study House 8, Pacific Palisades, California, 1949\n\n- Entenza House, Case Study House 9, Pacific Palisades, California, 1949\n\n- Billy Wilder House, Beverly Hills, California, 1950\n\n- Herman Miller Showroom, Los Angeles, California, 1950\n\n- Kwikset House, 1951 (Never actually built)\n\n- Max and Esther De Pree House, Zeeland, Michigan, 1954\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA documentary about the couple titled \"\" was released on November 18, 2011 as part of the American Masters series on PBS television and on YouTube from PBS as Cd1 and Cd2.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He showed his talent for fresco painting at an early age and painted in several Roman palaces, among them being that of Prince Torlonia. Under Gregory XVI he worked for three years in the Vatican.\n\nThe occupation of Rome by French forces in 1849 apparently persuaded Brumidi to emigrate, having joined the short-lived risorgimental Roman Republic, and he sailed for the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen in 1852. Taking up his residence in New York City, the artist painted a number of portraits. Subsequently, he undertook more important works, the principal being a fresco of the Crucifixion in St. Stephen's Church, for which he also executed a \"Martyrdom of St. Stephen\" and an \"Assumption of Mary\". He also executed frescoes at Taylor's Chapel, Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nIn 1854 Brumidi went to Mexico, where he painted an allegorical representation of the Holy Trinity in the Mexico City cathedral. On his way back to New York he stopped at Washington D.C. and visited the Capitol. Impressed with the opportunity for decoration presented by its vast interior wall spaces, he offered his services for that purpose to Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs. This offer was accepted, and about the same time Meigs was commissioned as a captain of cavalry.\n\nHis first art work in the Capitol Building was in the meeting room of the House Committee on Agriculture. At first he received eight dollars a day, which Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War of the United States, helped increase to ten dollars. His work attracting much favourable attention, he was given further commissions, and gradually settled into the position of a Government painter. His chief work in Washington was done in the rotunda of the Capitol and included the \"Apotheosis of George Washington\" in the dome and the Frieze of American History, which contains allegorical scenes from American history. His work in the rotunda was left unfinished at his death, but he had decorated many other sections of the building, most notably hallways in the Senate side of the Capitol now known as the Brumidi Corridors.\n\nBrumidi's \"Liberty\" and \"Union\" paintings are mounted near the ceiling of the White House entrance hall.\n\nIn the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he pictured St. Peter and St. Paul. Brumidi was a capable, if conventional painter, and his black and white modeling in the work at Washington, in imitation of bas-relief, is strikingly effective. He decorated the entrance hall of Saleaudo, located at Frederick, Maryland, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nA Brumidi fresco appears behind the altar in St. Ignatius Church in Baltimore, Maryland. Another, of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga receiving communion from Saint Charles Borromeo, hangs over the high altar of St Aloysius Church in Washington, D.C.\n\nBrumidi died in Washington, D.C., and was interred at Glenwood Cemetery. When he was buried, his grave was unmarked. The location of Brumidi's grave was lost for 72 years. It was rediscovered, and on February 19, 1952, a marker was finally placed above it.\n\nForgotten for many years, Brumidi's role was rescued from obscurity by Myrtle Cheney Murdock.\n\nOn June 10, 2008, Congress passed, and on September 1, 2008, President George W. Bush signed, Public Law 110-59 (122 Stat. 2430), which posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to Constantino Brumidi, to be displayed in the Capitol Visitor Center, as part of an exhibit honoring him.\n\n1.\"Broumidis.\" \"EI\" Magazine of European Art Center (EUARCE) 6st issue 1994 p.13 & 39-41\n\n\n"}

One of the highest-paid actresses in India, Padukone is the recipient of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards. She features in listings of the nation's most popular personalities, and \"Time\" named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018.\n\nPadukone, the daughter of the badminton player Prakash Padukone, was born in Copenhagen and raised in Bangalore. As a teenager, she played badminton in national level championships but left her career in the sport to become a fashion model. She soon received offers for film roles and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the Kannada film \"Aishwarya\". Padukone then played a dual role in her first Bollywood release, the romance \"Om Shanti Om\" (2007), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Padukone received praise for portraying the lead roles in the romance \"Love Aaj Kal\" (2009) and the drama \"Lafangey Parindey\" (2010), but her performances in the romance \"Bachna Ae Haseeno\" (2008) and the comedy \"Housefull\" (2010) were met with negative reviews.\n\nThe romantic comedy \"Cocktail\" (2012) marked a turning point in Padukone's career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies. She established herself with starring roles in the romantic comedies \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" and \"Chennai Express\" (both 2013), the heist comedy \"Happy New Year\" (2014), and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period dramas \"Bajirao Mastani\" (2015) and \"Padmaavat\" (2018), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films. Padukone's acclaimed portrayal of a character based on Juliet in Bhansali's tragic romance \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" (2013) and a headstrong architect in the comedy-drama \"Piku\" (2015) earned her two Filmfare Awards for Best Actress. Her first project in Hollywood came with the action film \"\" (2017).\n\nAlongside her acting career, Padukone participates in stage shows, has written columns for an Indian newspaper, is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products, and is vocal about issues such as feminism and depression. She has designed her own line of clothing for women and is the founder of the Live Love Laugh Foundation, which creates awareness on mental health in India. Padukone is married to her frequent co-star Ranveer Singh.\n\nPadukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen, Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents. Her father, Prakash Padukone, is a former badminton player of international repute, and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent. Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer. Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association. The family relocated to Bangalore, India when Padukone was a year old. She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College. She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career.\nPadukone has admitted to being socially awkward as a child and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, \"I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep.\" Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, \"I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all.\" In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.\n\nEarly in her career, Padukone gained recognition with a television commercial for the soap Liril and modelled for various other brands and products. In 2005, she made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Suneet Varma and won the \"Model of the Year\" award at the Kingfisher Fashion Awards. Padukone's fame increased when she appeared in a highly popular print campaign for the 2006 Kingfisher Calendar; the designer Wendell Rodricks commented, \"Since Aishwarya Rai, we haven't had a girl as beautiful and fresh.\" Rodricks had spotted her at a Ganjam jewellery class he was teaching and signed her up with the Matrix agency. At the age of 21, Padukone relocated to Mumbai and stayed at her aunt's home. That year, she gained wider recognition by featuring in the music video for Himesh Reshammiya's song \"Naam Hai Tera.\"\n\nPadukone soon began to receive offers for film roles. Believing herself to be too inexperienced as an actor, she instead enrolled for a course at Anupam Kher's film academy. Following much media speculation, the director Farah Khan, who had noticed her in Reshammiya's music video, made the decision to cast her for a role in \"Happy New Year\".\n\nPadukone announced in 2006 that she would make her film debut with \"Aishwarya\", a Kannada film directed by Indrajit Lankesh. The romantic comedy was a remake of the Telugu film \"Manmadhudu\", and she was cast in the title role opposite the actor Upendra. The film proved to be a major commercial success. RG Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com was appreciative of Padukone's screen presence but added that \"she needs to work on her emotional scenes.\"\n\nBy the end of 2006, Farah Khan's \"Happy New Year\" was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the reincarnation melodrama \"Om Shanti Om\" (2007). Set against the backdrop of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual rolesShantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, \"I've grown up watching [Shah Rukh] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him ... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him.\" In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt \"were more graceful\" and \"completely different from today's actors.\" However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty. For one of the songs in the film, \"Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, \"mesmeriz[ed] audiences\" by using \"hasta mudras\" (hand gestures). \"Om Shanti Om\" was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of . Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reviewed, \"Deepika has all it takes to be a top starthe personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as [Shah Rukh] and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air!\" At the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, Padukone was awarded the Best Female Debut Award and received her first nomination in the Best Actress category.\nBollywood Hungama reported that the success of \"Om Shanti Om\" proved a breakthrough for Padukone. She followed this success with the role of Gayatri (one of star Ranbir Kapoor's love interests), a feisty student in Australia who moonlights as a cab driver in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy \"Bachna Ae Haseeno\" (2008). The film was a financial success, but Namrata Joshi of \"Outlook\" wrote that Padukone's performance was disappointing; \"She is mannequin-like and utterly lacks fire and zing.\"\n\nPadukone's first release of 2009 came alongside Akshay Kumar in the Nikhil Advani-directed kung fu comedy \"Chandni Chowk To China\", in which she portrayed the dual roles of Indian-Chinese twin sisters Sakhi and Suzy. Produced by Warner Bros., it had one of the widest international releases ever given to an Indian film. Padukone learned the Japanese martial art form of jujutsu and performed her stunts without the use of a body double. Despite the hype, \"Chandni Chowk To China\" emerged as a major financial failure with worldwide earnings of on a budget of . Film critics were generally disappointed with the picture and Padukone's performance; Justin Trout of \"Orlando Weekly\" noted, \"She is so wasted in \"Chandni Chowk\", my mind often wandered back to \"Om Shanti Om\" during her scenes, possibly as a defense mechanism.\"\n\nThat same year, Padukone featured in an item number (for a song called \"Love Mera Hit Hit\") in the drama \"Billu\", following which she appeared alongside Saif Ali Khan in the romantic drama \"Love Aaj Kal\" from the writer-director Imtiaz Ali. The film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth and had Padukone play the part of Meera Pandit, a head-strong career woman. With a worldwide gross of , \"Love Aaj Kal\" proved to be the third highest-grossing film of 2009. Aniruddha Guha of \"Daily News and Analysis\" said that Padukone \"delivers the best of her four performances so far\" and Nikhat Kazmi of \"The Times of India\" mentioned her as \"definitive and strong.\" At the 55th Filmfare Awards Padukone received a nomination for Best Actress.\n\nPadukone had five film releases in 2010. Her first role was in Vijay Lalwani's psychological thriller \"Karthik Calling Karthik\", where Padukone was cast as the supportive girlfriend of a depressed man (played by Farhan Akhtar) who goes through a series of changes after receiving mysterious phone calls every morning. Derek Elley of \"Variety\" found the film to be \"thinly plotted\" but added that \"the uncomplicated ingenuousness of Padukone ... helps make the tall tale convincing.\" Commercially, the film performed poorly. Her most economically profitable film that year was Sajid Khan's -grossing comedy film \"Housefull\" in which she featured alongside an ensemble cast including Akshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh, Lara Dutta, Arjun Rampal, Jiah Khan, and Boman Irani. Raja Sen described the film as a \"festival of bad acting\" and attributed Padukone's poor performance to her \"plasticky expressions.\"\nPradeep Sarkar's drama \"Lafangey Parindey\" (2010) saw Padukone star opposite Neil Nitin Mukesh in the role of Pinky Palkar, a blind girl determined to win a skating competition. In preparation for her role, she observed the interactions of blind people and rehearsed scenes while blindfolded. Writing for \"The Hindu\", Sudhish Kamath was particularly impressed by Padukone and wrote that she \"exercises considerable restraint\" in playing her part. Later that year, \"Hindustan Times\" published that the film helped change people's perception of Padukone, with focus directed on her acting prowess rather than her appearance. Her next role was opposite Imran Khan in the Danish Aslam-directed romantic comedy \"Break Ke Baad\". CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand found the film to be \"reasonably engaging\" and noted that it was \"watchable largely for the performance of its leading lady.\" Both \"Lafangey Parindey\" and \"Break Ke Baad\" underperformed at the box office.\n\nPadukone's final release of 2010 was Ashutosh Gowarikar's period film \"Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey\" opposite Abhishek Bachchan. Based on the book \"Do and Die\" by Manini Chatterjee, the film is a retelling of the 1930 Chittagong armoury raid. Bachchan featured as the revolutionary leader Surya Sen and Padukone played Kalpana Dutta, his confidante. Padukone said that she did not research for the role as there were \"hardly ... any reference points as to what Kalpana looked like other than a few photos,\" and relied completely on Gowarikar's direction. A review published in \"The Telegraph\" was appreciative of Padukone's portrayal, and the film received a generally positive critical reception. Despite this, it was a major commercial disappointment.\n\nPadukone began 2011 with an item number in Rohan Sippy's \"Dum Maaro Dum\". The song was a remixed version of the iconic song \"Dum Maro Dum,\" from the 1971 film \"Hare Rama Hare Krishna\", which featured Zeenat Aman. Padukone referred to it as \"the wildest song any actress has done;\" the song's \"suggestive lyrics\" and \"raunchy moves\" attracted controversy including a court case for indecency. Her next film was Prakash Jha's socio-political drama \"Aarakshan\", co-starring Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Manoj Bajpayee and Prateik Babbar, which dealt with the political issue of caste-based reservations in India. Trade journalists had high expectations for the film which ultimately flopped at the box office. Critical reaction was largely negative, though Pratim D. Gupta mentioned Padukone as the most \"refreshing thing about [the] movie.\" Her final appearance that year was in Rohit Dhawan's comedy-drama \"Desi Boyz\" alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham and Chitrangada Singh, a role that failed to propel her career forward. The series of poorly received films led critics to perceive that Padukone had \"[lost] her sparkle.\"\n\nIn an interview for \"The Indian Express\", Padukone said that her starring role in the 2012 Homi Adajania-directed romantic comedy \"Cocktail\" marked a significant turning point in her career. Raja Sen of Rediff.com opined that she had successfully proved to be a \"stunning girl who can also act.\" Set in London, \"Cocktail\" tells the story of a software engineer (played by Saif Ali Khan) and his relationship with two temperamentally different womenan impulsive party girl (Veronica, played by Padukone) and a submissive girl next door (Meera, played by Diana Penty). During the script narration, the producer Dinesh Vijan offered Padukone the choice of which woman to play; she decided on Veronica to expand her horizons as an actress. Portraying the role was a creative and physical challenge for her, and to achieve the physical requirements of her character she exercised extensively and followed a rigorous diet. Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but particularly praised Padukone's performance; Devesh Sharma of \"Filmfare\" credited her as the \"soul of the film\" and wrote that she \"excels in every scene, whether as a material girl who enjoys sex, drugs and rock and roll or as the jealousy ridden girl out to destroy herself.\" \"Cocktail\" earned Padukone Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare, Screen, and IIFA. The film proved to be a box office hit as well.\n\nIn 2013, Padukone established herself as a leading actress of contemporary Hindi cinema by featuring in four of the top-grossing productions of the year. She collaborated with Saif Ali Khan for the fourth time (alongside John Abraham and Jacqueline Fernandez) in Abbas-Mustan's \"Race 2\", an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to \"Race\" (2008). The film received predominantly negative reviews, but with a total collection of , it proved to be a commercial success. In a scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that both Padukone and Fernandez \"strut around like wound-up automatons that are all decked-up but have nowhere to go.\"\nAyan Mukerji's romantic comedy \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" was Padukone's next film release. Co-starring opposite Ranbir Kapoor, she was cast as Naina Talwar, a \"shy wallflower,\" which marked a departure from the glamorous characters that she had a reputation for portraying. Film critics praised her performance, though their response to the film was mixed. Raja Sen thought that the film \"lacked a good story\" but added that Padukone \"acts within herself and eschews exaggeration, and the results are impressive ... This may be her most self-aware performance so far\". The pairing of Padukone with her former boyfriend was anticipated, and the film emerged as a major commercial success. Her next appearance was opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Rohit Shetty's action-comedy film \"Chennai Express\". She played Meenalochini Azhagusundaram, a Tamil girl on the run from her father (a local don), which required that she adopt a Tamil accent. Critical opinion on her accent was mixed, but her performance received praise; film critic Aseem Chhabra wrote, \"Padukone is delightful in the filmbeautiful, smiling, and often a lot more playful and funny than Khan.\" \"Chennai Express\" earned over to emerge as Padukone's highest-grossing release to that point, and alongside \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" it ranks among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.\n\nPadukone next played opposite Ranveer Singh in \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\", an adaptation of the Shakespearean tragedy of \"Romeo and Juliet\" from director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Her role was Leela, a Gujarati girl based on the character of Juliet. Initially titled \"Ram-Leela\", the film's title was changed after a court case was registered against Bhansali, Padukone, and Singh for \"offending the religious sentiments\" of the Hindu community by showcasing sex and violence under a title that referred to the life of Rama. \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" released among protests across several states in India, but was generally well received by critics. Meena Iyer of \"The Times of India\" mentioned Padukone as \"breathtaking\", and writing for \"Deccan Chronicle\", Khalid Mohamed concluded that \"it’s Deepika Padukone whom the film belongs to. Looking drop dead gorgeous and going at her part with a wallop, she’s the prime asset of \"Ram-Leela\".\" The film earned worldwide, making it Padukone's fourth consecutive success of the year. Her performances in \"Chennai Express\" and \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" won her several awards, including the Screen Award for Best Actress for both films and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the latter.\n\nIn 2014, Padukone featured opposite Rajinikanth in the Tamil film \"Kochadaiiyaan\", a period drama that was shot using motion capture technology. She was paid for two days worth of work in it. In Homi Adajania's widely praised satire \"Finding Fanny\", Padukone played a young widow who takes a road trip with her dysfunctional friends (played by Arjun Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, Dimple Kapadia and Pankaj Kapur) in search of a woman named Fanny. The film was screened at the 19th Busan International Film Festival; critic Anuj Kumar of \"The Hindu\" wrote that Padukone successfully \"takes off the fineries of Bollywood and you can sense the freedom from baggage in her performance\". Later that year, she starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan for the third time in Farah Khan's renewal of \"Happy New Year\". She played a bar dancer who trains a group of underachievers for a dance competition. Sanjukta Sharma of \"Mint\" found her role to be of minimal importance that required her only to be \"a pretty thing to be laughed at and pitied\", but the film became one of her most successful, earning over worldwide.\n\nFollowing an appearance in Homi Adajania's online video on feminism, entitled \"My Choice\", Padukone took on the role of a headstrong Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in Shoojit Sircar's comedy-drama \"Piku\" (2015). She was drawn to the depiction of a realistic father-daughter bond, which she thought was rare in Hindi cinema. Reviews for the film were positive; Tanmaya Nanda of \"Business Standard\" praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves \"what she is capable of when given something more to do than look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties\". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she \"holds \"Piku\" together with a restrained star turn\". With a worldwide gross of over , \"Piku\" emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen.\n\nLater in 2015, Padukone played the part of a businessperson who helps Ranbir Kapoor's character overcome his conflicts in Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama \"Tamasha\". Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she \"is so potent in \"Tamasha\", it’s almost as if you can hear her heartbeat across the screen\". In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in \"Bajirao Mastani\", a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I, while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. To play the warrior-princess Mastani, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding, and the martial art form of kalaripayattu. With a revenue of over , \"Bajirao Mastani\" proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. Anupama Chopra found Padukone \"riveting\", but Subhash K. Jha thought that she was \"way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough\". The film was showcased at the International Film Festival of India; at the 61st Filmfare Awards, \"Bajirao Mastani\" was named Best Film and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year.\n\nThe action film \"\" (2017), in which Padukone played the lead female role of Serena Unger, opposite Vin Diesel, marked her first project in Hollywood. Critical reception of the film was mixed. Tirdad Derakhshani of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" termed the film a \"repetitious heap of remarkably tedious CGI-enhanced action scenes\" and thought that Padukone's talent was wasted in it. Conversely, Frank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" believed that she had successfully \"outclassed\" Diesel to \"practically [steal] the film\". The film earned over US$345 million worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office. Padukone received three nominations at the Teen Choice Awards and followed it with an item number in the romantic drama \"Raabta\".\n\nIn 2018, Padukone portrayed Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen who commits \"jauhar\" (self-immolation) to protect herself from the Muslim invader Alauddin Khilji, in the period drama \"Padmaavat\"; it marked her third collaboration with Bhansali and Singh. She was challenged by the need to convey her character's courage through silence and considered it to be the most emotionally exhausting role of her career. She read history books on the era and researched the various historical depictions of Padmavati. Right-wing Hindu groups speculated that the film portrayed a romantic liaison between Padmavati and Khilji; they protested violently and placed a bounty to behead Padukone and Bhansali. Following a deferment in release, the film was cleared for exhibition after several modifications were made to it. Anna M. M. Vetticad of \"Firstpost\" criticised the film's glorification of \"jauhar\", but credited Padukone for managing to \"eke something out of the stereotype-ridden writing\". Ankur Pathak of \"HuffPost\" too took note of the film's regressive theme but thought that Padukone had played her part with \"restrained elegance\". With an estimated budget of , \"Padmaavat\" is the most expensive Hindi film, and with earnings of , it is Padukone's highest-grossing release and one of Indian cinema's biggest grossers.\n\nPadukone is next set to reprise the role of Serena Unger in the fourth instalment of the \"xXx\" film series. She has also committed to star as the acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal in a biopic by Meghna Gulzar, which will mark her first production venture.\n\nPadukone shares a close bond with her family, and visits them regularly in her hometown of Bangalore. She lives by herself in Prabhadevi, a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and admits to missing the presence of her family there. She says, \"I miss them, but luckily I have a life of my own, which keeps me from getting homesick. I wouldn’t want them to uproot their lives from Bengaluru just to be with me.\" A practicing Hindu, Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to temples and other religious shrines.\n\nWhile filming \"Bachna Ae Haseeno\" in 2008, Padukone began a romantic relationship with co-star Ranbir Kapoor. She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the nape of her neck. She has said that the relationship had a profound effect on her, transforming her into a more confident and social person. The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years. The couple broke up a year later; she professed in an interview to feeling betrayed for a long time. In a 2010 interview, Padukone accused him of infidelity, and Kapoor later admitted to it. They reconciled their friendship while working on \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\". Padukone subsequently became reticent to discuss her personal life, but in 2017, she fondly spoke of her relationship with her frequent co-star Ranveer Singh. In November 2018, the couple married in traditional Konkani and Sindhi ceremonies at Lake Como, Italy.\nIn addition to acting, Padukone has written opinion columns and has been involved with women's health and fitness magazines. She has also supported charitable organisations, and has performed for stage shows. In 2009, she was hired by \"Hindustan Times\" to write weekly columns for their lifestyle section; through these columns she interacted with her fans and passed details of her personal and professional life. That year, she participated in the World 10K Bangalore marathon, which raised in support of 81 NGOs. In 2010, Padukone adopted the Maharashtrian village of Ambegaon as part of NDTV's Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity. She visited Indian \"jawans\" (troops) in Jammu, for an Independence Day special episode of NDTV's reality show \"Jai Jawaan\".\n\nPadukone took part in the opening ceremony of the third season of the Indian Premier League at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. Three years later, she performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, and Pitbull for the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League. In 2014, she participated in a concert tour across North America, entitled \"SLAM! The Tour\", in which she performed alongside her co-stars from \"Happy New Year\". Padukone has also been involved with the Olympic Gold Quest team, established by her father and Geet Sethi to support Indian athletes at the Olympic Games, along with sports personalities such as Leander Paes and Viswanathan Anand and several other actors. In 2013, she launched her own line of clothing for women, in association with the retail chain Van Heusen. Two years later, Padukone collaborated with the fashion portal Myntra to launch another line under her brand \"All About You\".\n\nPadukone has also been outspoken on issues such as feminism and has said, \"New feminism isn't about being aggressive; it's about reaching the top yet being soft. It's about being you — feminine, strong and full of will power.” In a 2015 interview, Padukone spoke about her personal experience of overcoming depression, and in October that year she formed a foundation to create awareness on mental health in India, named The Live Love Laugh Foundation. The following year, she launched a campaign named More Than Just Sad to assist general physicians in their treatment of patients suffering from depression or anxiety. Also in 2016, the foundation teamed with Facebook and the AASRA organisation to launch multilingual tools and educational resources in Facebook's networking site to support people with suicidal tendencies. Padukone became the brand ambassador for the NGO Indian Psychiatric Society and on her foundation's first anniversary, the two organisations collaborated to launch the video and poster campaign #DobaraPoocho dedicated to victims and survivors of depression.\n\nThe journalist Vir Sanghvi, in 2013, described Padukone as \"strong, someone who makes up her own mind, [and] has motivation within herself.\" She is particularly known in the media as a professional, disciplined performer, whose \"work takes precedence over everything else.\" A reviewer for Rediff.com described her personality as \"simple,\" \"grounded,\" and \"accessible,\" and wrote, \"She takes criticism in her stride, acknowledges her limitations and strives to work hard at getting better. She handles praise with equal composure.\" Ayan Mukerji (the director of \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\") considers her to be \"a woman who will flirt with you but you will love to take her home to meet your mom as well.\" Padukone has maintained a Twitter account since 2010, and launched an official Facebook page in 2013. She is the most followed Asian woman on Twitter.\n\nPadukone is considered among the most popular and high-profile celebrities in India. Analysing her career, Reuters published that after making a successful debut with \"Om Shanti Om\", she featured in a series of films for which critics labelled her as \"wooden\" and \"mocked her accent.\" \"The Indian Express\" added, \"Not too long ago after a few unwise script calls and the public blow up of her high profile relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika was written off. Credit to her much touted professionalism, dedication, discipline and perseverance that she bounced back.\" Following the major success of \"Cocktail\", \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\", and \"Chennai Express\", several media publications began crediting her as the most successful contemporary actress in India. From 2014–2016, she was the highest ranked woman on the Indian edition of \"Forbes\" \"Celebrity 100\" (a list based on the income and popularity of celebrities), peaking at the sixth position in 2016 with an estimated annual earning of . In 2017, \"India Today\" featured her among the nation's 50 most powerful people. The global edition of \"Forbes\" ranked her as the tenth highest-paid actress in the world in 2016 and the following year, the magazine calculated her annual salary to be US$11 million, one of the highest for an Indian celebrity. In 2018, \"Time\" magazine named Padukone one of the 100 most influential people in the world, \"Variety\" featured her in their listing of the 50 most impactful women in the world, and the market research firm YouGov named her the world's thirteenth most admired woman.\n\nPadukone is considered a sex symbol and style icon in India – the media cites her figure, height , smile, and eyes as her distinctive physical features. The actress ranks high on various listings of the most attractive Indian celebrities. In 2008, she topped \"Indian \"Maxim\"\"s \"Hot 100\" list, and in 2012, she was named \"India's Most Beautiful Woman\" by the Indian edition of \"People\" magazine. Padukone was ranked first on \"The Times of India\"s listing of the \"Most Desirable Woman\" in 2012 and 2013, after being ranked third and fourth, respectively, for the preceding two years; she was placed second in 2014 and 2015. In 2010 and 2014, she was named the \"World's Sexiest Woman\" by the Indian edition of \"FHM\". and she was selected by the UK magazine \"Eastern Eye\" as 2016's \"Sexiest Asian Woman\". In 2013, \"Filmfare\" declared her as the winner of the \"Most Fashionable Star\" poll, and credited her as one of the \"few actresses who experiments with colours, cuts and silhouettes.\" In the fitness book \"The Four-Week Countdown Diet\", the actress was cited by Namita Jain as \"the ultimate role model for a healthy, fit and active lifestyle.\"\n\nPadukone is an active celebrity endorser for several brands and products, including Tissot, Maybelline, Coca-Cola, and L'Oreal Paris, among others. In 2014, \"Business Standard\" reported that Padukone earned to per endorsement deal and TAM AdEX named Padukone the most visible face on television in India that year. In 2016, Duff & Phelps estimated her brand value to be US$86 million, the third highest of Indian celebrities.\n\nPadukone has been the recipient of three Filmfare Awards: Best Female Debut for \"Om Shanti Om\" (2007), and two Best Actress awards for \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" (2013) and \"Piku\" (2015).\n\n"}

He was born in 1886 in Adwa, a northern Ethiopian town. In a trip to the port of Massawa, Gebrehiwot and his friends got permission from the captain of a German ship to visit the ship. On departure, he stowed away (this may not have been deliberate, according to Alemayehu Geda, 2004). On arrival, the captain entrusted the young boy to a rich Austrian family, who adopted him. This good fortune opened to him the opportunity to study the German language and to go to school. His exposure to Western education was thorough, and he pursued medical studies at Berlin University. He returned to his country and became private secretary and interpreter to the Emperor Menelik II, who defeated the Italian colonial army in 1896 at the Battle of Adwa. Later on, while the Haile Selassie was still the successor to the throne, he fulfilled important administrative functions. He served as inspector of the important Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway until his premature death in 1919.\n\nHe published two majors works in Amharic, the Ethiopian national language: \"Mengistna ye Hizb Astadadar\", published in 1924 after his death and translated into English in 1995 as \"State and Economy of Early 20th Century Ethiopia\"; and in 1912, \"Atse Menilik na Ethiopia\", which was translated into French in 1993 as \"L'Empereur Menelik et L'Ethiopie\".\n\nProfessor Emeritus of History at Addis Ababa University, Professor Bahru Zewde tells us that the latter book was written with the hopes that Menelik’s successor, Iyasu V would take up his recommendations and proceed to modernize the Ethiopian state.\n\nWhile his recommendations went unheeded by a young prince little interested in the affairs of state, Gebrehiwot went on to exert considerable influence on Ethiopian affairs for the rest of the century. His writings expressed deep concern with national institutions, structural economics, income inequality in development, and trade imbalance between developed and underdeveloped nations. It is for this reason that Addis Ababa University Professor of Economics Dr. Alemayehu Geda calls Gebrehiwot one of the world’s pioneers in the study of \"Development Economics\".\n\nAfter his death at the age of 33, his ideas went on to influence generations of Ethiopian intellectuals. One can clearly distinguish Gebrehiwot’s ideas in the thought processes of the young revolutionaries of the 1970s.\n"}

He is a Christian Zionist and dispensationalist author and television host.\n\nLindsey graduated from Dallas Theological Seminary with a Master of Theology degree, majoring in the New Testament and early Greek literature. With his second wife, Jan, he worked with Campus Crusade for Christ and continued with them until 1969. He then helped a mission in Southern California which continued until 1976. He was also a frequent speaker and Sunday School teacher at Melodyland Christian Center in Anaheim, California. During 1969, he wrote his first, and best-known book, \"The Late, Great Planet Earth\". Published during 1970 by Zondervan, this book became a bestseller. Coming on the heels of the Six-Day War, the book fueled the popularity of dispensationalism and its support of ethnic Jews as the \"chosen people of God\". Many of Lindsey's later writings are sequels or revisions and extensions of his first book. During 1994, he earned his Doctorate of Theology from the California Graduate School of Theology.\n\nLindsey hosted \"International Intelligence Briefing\" on the Trinity Broadcasting Network and serves on the executive board of Christian Voice.\n\n\"International Intelligence Briefing\" was eliminated from broadcasting by TBN for the entire month of December 2005. Lindsey claimed that this was because \"some at the network apparently feel that [his] message is too pro-Israel and too anti-Muslim.\" TBN owner Paul Crouch, however, contended that \"TBN has never been and is not now against Israel and the Jewish people.\" Crouch said that Lindsey's show was pre-empted for Christmas programming. Lindsey countered that this was the first time his show had been preempted for the entire month of December. TBN later admitted that a secondary reason for pre-empting the show was that it \"placed Arabs in a negative light.\"\n\nLindsey resigned from TBN on January 1, 2006, and indicated that he would pursue another television ministry. His new program, \"The Hal Lindsey Report\", emphasizes Biblical prophecy and current events, and is broadcast by the Angel One and DayStar networks. During January 2007, Lindsey announced that he would be returning to the TBN network. \"The Hal Lindsey Report\" is broadcast by TBN with his own financing.\n\nLindsey's claims are based on a dispensationalist interpretation of the implications of Jesus Christ as presented in the four gospels of the New Testament as the divine Son of God and the Jewish Messiah. Lindsey claims from the Bible that Jesus Christ will return from heaven to earth someday and establish eternal peace, happiness, prosperity, and harmony among all people.\n\nLindsey says the Bible contains numerous prophecies that foretell of certain conditions and events that will occur in the world prior to Christ's return. He continues, saying that, as these things occur, they are to serve as signs and reminders that we are in the era that the Bible calls the \"end times\" or \"last days\". Lindsey believes a prophetic event that officially begins the \"end times\" is the regathering of the Jewish people to their ancient homeland to form an independent nation after a prolonged worldwide dispersion. He states that the establishment of the State of Israel during May 1948 is the fulfillment of this major prophecy. He also states that the last seven years of the \"end times\" is a period known as the Tribulation; which is described in the gospel of Matthew and the book of Revelation.\n\nIn \"The Late Great Planet Earth\", Lindsey wrote that the biblical prophets identified certain nations that would ally with other countries to form \"four major spheres of political power\" during the same era that Israel would be reestablished as a nation. Lindsey wrote that these nations and their allies can be identified as: (1) Russia with its allies, (2) China with other nations of the Orient, (3) Egypt with other Middle East countries, and (4) an alliance of Western European nations.\n\nAccording to Lindsey, the alliance of Western European nations is a revived form of the ancient Roman Empire, predicted in the books of Daniel and Revelation symbolically as \"ten horns\" and \"ten kings\". In \"The Late Great Planet Earth\", Lindsey quotes from a 1969 Time Magazine article that the goal of the European Economic Community, which preceded the European Union, was to establish a ten-nation economic community. Lindsey concludes, based on this and other sources, that this alliance will help cause the fulfillment of this prophecy and will ultimately be ruled by the Antichrist. \n\nLindsey noted that the prophets did not refer to the United States of America directly or indirectly. He concluded that this is an indication that the U.S. will no longer be a great geo-political power by the time the Tribulation of the end times arrives.\n\nIn a later book, titled, \"The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon\", he indicated that he believed it was possible that the battle of Armageddon could occur in the not too distant future, stating, \"the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it.\" He noted again that there is no reference to the U.S. in Bible prophecy. He listed a few scenarios that seemed plausible to him at the time: (1) A takeover by Communists, (2) destruction by a surprise Soviet nuclear attack, or (3) becoming a dependent of the 10-nation European community. The book was on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list for more than 20 weeks.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of French general Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet who was guillotined in 1793. \n\nBrunet became Chef de brigade (colonel) of the 13th Light Infantry Demi-brigade on 26 June 1794. This was the same day as the Battle of Fleurus where the 13th Light fought in François Joseph Lefebvre's division. He was still the commanding officer when this unit became the 25th Light Infantry Demi-brigade on 1 July 1796. The 13th Light was in Lefebvre's Advance Guard on 1 October during the Rhine Campaign of 1795.

However accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One account has it that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in Saint-Domingue and asked for Toussaint's advice about plantation management. Louverture's memoirs however suggest that Brunet's troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him. Embarrassed about his trickery, Brunet absented himself during the arrest. He was captured by the British and not released until 1814. \n\n"}

{"id": "1911623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911623", "title": "Lemuel Haynes", "text": "Lemuel Haynes\n\nLemuel Haynes (July 18, 1753 – September 28, 1833) was an American clergyman. A veteran of the American Revolution, Haynes was the first black man in the United States to be ordained as a minister.\n\nHaynes was a native of West Hartford, Connecticut, and was the son of an African American man and a white woman. He spent much of his childhood as an indentured servant in the house of a Granville, Massachusetts farmer. A regular churchgoer, he began to preach as a boy. He served in the militia during the American Revolution, including garrison duty at the recently captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. Haynes also became an anti-slavery activist. In addition to arguing against involuntary servitude and preaching against the slave trade, Haynes also advocated against the colonization movement, arguing that people of African descent living in the United States should be entitled to the same rights as other citizens, and that having them resettle in Africa would not be beneficial.\n\nOrdained in the Congregational church in 1785, Haynes pastored a church in Torrington, Connecticut for three years. In 1788, Haynes left the temporary position at the Torrington congregation to accept a call to pastor the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now West Rutland's United Church of Christ), where he remained for the next 33 years. He them moved to South Granville, New York, where he was pastor of South Granville Congregational Church.\n\nHaynes died in South Granville in 1833, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville.\n\nLittle is known of his early life. He was born on July 18, 1753 at\nWest Hartford, Connecticut, reportedly to a Caucasian mother of some status and a man named Haynes, who was said to be \"of some form of African extraction\".\n\nAt the age of five months, Lemuel Haynes was given over to indentured servitude on the Granville, Massachusetts farm of Deacon David Rose. Part of the indenture required Rose to see to Haynes's education, and by accompanying Rose to church, he became exposed to Calvinistic religious doctrine, including the works of Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and Philip Doddridge, who all became strong influences on Haynes' religious outlook.\n\nFreed in 1774 when his indenture expired, Haynes joined the minutemen of Granville. In 1775, he marched with his militia company to Roxbury, Massachusetts, following the news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1776, he accompanied them in the garrisoning of the recently captured Fort Ticonderoga. He remained on garrison duty until contracting Typhus, which caused him to return home.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Haynes began to write extensively, criticizing the slave trade and slavery. He continued these activities after the war, and also began to prepare sermons, family prayers and other theological works. The Scripture, abolitionism, and republicanism affected his published writings, in which Haynes argued that slavery denied black people their natural rights to \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness\". Paralleling the recent American experience with oppression to the slave experience, Haynes wrote: \"Liberty is equally as precious to a black man, as it is to a white one, and bondage as equally as intolerable to the one as it is to the other\".\n\nAfter his militia service, Haynes studied theology with members of the clergy in Connecticut and Massachusetts. He received his license to preach in 1780, along with a position as temporary 'supply' to his home congregation in Middle Granville. About the same time, he began his many years of service as a missionary in the wilderness of the New Hampshire Grants, soon to be known as the independent Vermont Republic and finally the American state of Vermont.\n\nHaynes was ordained in 1785 and settled at Hemlock Congregational Church in Torrington, Connecticut. He was the first African American ordained in the United States. On March 28, 1788, Haynes left his pastorate at Torrington to accept a call at the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now West Rutland's United Church of Christ), where he served the mostly white congregation for 30 years.\n\nHaynes continued to write and speak about slavery. His contemporary white republican and abolitionist thinkers did see slavery as a liability to the new country, but most argued for eventual slave expatriation to Africa. The American Colonization Society (founded in 1817) was the largest colonization group. Included among its supporters were people such as James Madison, James Monroe, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. The ACS was strongly supported in Vermont. In contrast, Haynes continued to passionately argue along Calvinist lines that God's providential plan would defeat slavery and lead to the harmonious integration of the races as equals.\n\nAfter asking for and accepting dismissal from West Rutland in 1818, he took a temporary post at Manchester. His final pastorate was in South Granville, New York where he was pastor of the South Granville Congregational Church for 11 years from 1822 to 1833.\n\nHaynes died in South Granville, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville. He had composed his own epitaph, which was included on his gravestone as he had requested.\n\nWhile living in Middle Granville in the early 1780s, Haynes met and married Elizabeth Babbitt (1763-1836), a white schoolteacher. Their children included:\n\nMiddlebury College granted Haynes an honorary master of arts in 1804, the first honorary degree ever bestowed upon an African American.\n\nHistorian John Saillant (2003, p. 3) writes that Haynes's \"faith and social views are better documented than those of any African American born before the luminaries of the mid-nineteenth century.\"\n\nLemuel Haynes House, his home for the last 11 years of his life in South Granville, New York, when he was pastor of South Granville Congregational Church was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975. Originally sitting on a parcel of the PAR Farm, it was purchased from Charles Halderman in 2009 by Bo Young and William Foote, formerly of Brooklyn.\n\n\n"}

Her father, Captain Johan Adolph Fibiger, was an army officer; her mother was Margrethe Cecilia Nielsen Aasen. Her elder sister was Ilia Fibiger.\n\nMathilde Fibiger was a novelist who championed women's rights in her first novel, \"Clara Raphael, Tolv Breve\" (\"Clara Raphael, Twelve Letters\"), published in 1851. It is the partially autobiographical story of a young woman, Clara Raphael, who works as a governess in the provinces; it is based in part on Fibiger's experiences as a private tutor on the island of Lolland in 1849. The novel consists largely of letters written by Clara to her friend, Mathilde; Clara's ideas about women living an independent life run counter to the beliefs of the local population, and she resolves to make women's emancipation her life objective. The book created a great deal of controversy on its publication in 1851; while the Danish literary establishment was divided between those who supported her and those who felt that her ideas were too radical, all agreed on the literary merit of her work.\n\nFibiger was the first public figure in Denmark to forward the women's rights issue. She wrote novels, articles and discussion papers since age 20 in 1851.\n\nIn counter opinions in society against women's rights, Fibiger published two pamphlets; \"Hvad er Emancipation?\" (What is Emancipation?) and \"Et Besøg\" (A Visit). Her later novels included \"En Skizze efter det virkelige Liv\" (A Sketch from Real Life, 1853) and \"Minona. En Fortaelling\" (Minona: A Tale, 1854). \"En Skizze efter det virkelige Liv\" is the story of two sisters who were orphaned at an early age, and the men with whom they develop relationships; the older sister rejects her suitor, feeling that men are weak, while the younger sister falls in love. \"Minona\" created new controversy with its complex plot involving unwed mothers and incest; Minona, the chief character, overcomes her incestuous attraction after converting to Christianity.\n\nWhile Fibiger's novels generated critical acclaim, they were not commercially successful, and she began to look for other means to support herself. She supplemented a meager allowance, received from the state, by dressmaking and translating German literary works. In 1863, she began training as a telegraph operator for the Danish State Telegraph service, which had recently decided to hire women as operators under the management of Director Peter Faber. In 1866, she completed her training at the Helsingør telegraph station, and became the first woman to be employed as a telegraph operator in Denmark.\n\nAfter two years in Helsingør, she was transferred to Nysted in 1869 to manage a newly opened station. Not surprisingly, she encountered resistance from male operators, who saw the employment of women as operators as a threat to their livelihood. In spite of her managerial position, her pay at Nysted was scarcely sufficient to enable her to pay her expenses. The following year, she applied for a transfer to the telegraph station in Aarhus.\n\nShe continued to experience difficulties in Aarhus, where the station manager had opposed her assignment. The problems she experienced in her telegraphic work began to affect her health; she died in Aarhus in 1872 at the age of 41. She is remembered today in Denmark not only as a pioneering feminist who wrote in support of women's rights, but also as the woman who opened the door for the employment of women in the Danish State Telegraph service.\n\nSuch was her prominence as an advocate for gender equality, in order to honour it, the \"Dansk Kvindesamfund\" (Danish Women's Society) created \"Mathildeprisen\" (The Mathilde Prize). The Mathilde Prize was established in 1970 and is awarded to both men and women in recognition of work that advances gender equality. Recipients of the prize includes Suzanne Brøgger, Joan-søstrene, Kenneth Reinicke, Anja Andersen and Anja C. Andersen.\n\nA small garden square adjacent to the Women's Museum in central Aarhus is named \"Mathilde Fibigers Have\" in her honor.\n\n"}

He lived in Chicago and Kansas City before moving to Los Angeles in the 1930s and soon became underboss to Jack Dragna in the Los Angeles crime family. His brother Joseph Adamo was also a member of the crime family. Both he and his brother were well connected criminals in San Diego, working with such mobsters as Frank Bompensiero. In 1950, Momo was arrested along with several members of Jack Dragna's family including Tom Dragna (brother), Louis Dragna (nephew), and two men named Frank Paul Dragna (his son and nephew, respectively) after Jack fled the state after being named in the California Crime Commission report as a member of a crime syndicate in Los Angeles. The five of them were taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department, who believed they were responsible for bombing Mickey Cohen's home or knew who was. They were all released without being charged when the police couldn't find evidence of their involvement (Tom built the bomb, but otherwise none of them were involved).\n\nWhen Jack Dragna died in 1956, the Los Angeles crime family cast a vote to see who would become the next boss. Momo was hoping as a long time L.A. Mob leader, he would be elected. However, USC trained lawyer-turned-mobster Frank DeSimone was elected boss in what is believed to be a rigged election. DeSimone demoted Adamo, and Adamo moved to San Diego shortly after. In the same year, Adamo attempted a murder–suicide by shooting his wife Marie Adamo in the head, before shooting himself. Marie ended up surviving. The reason for the attempted murder isn't confirmed, but according to police informants, Adamo's shooting himself and Marie was possibly out of shame from Frank DeSimone raping Adamo's wife while being forced to watch. Other sources have trouble believing the straight laced DeSimone, a USC graduate and a practicing attorney, would have raped a mob associate's wife, or anyone else. Adamo's wife Marie was having an affair during their marriage and an alternative theory given is that Adamo committed these actions after finding out about her affair. Marie Adamo who never talked about the shooting incident publicly, recovered and later married Frank Bompensiero, who was widowed after his wife Thelma died.\n\n"}

{"id": "387165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387165", "title": "Poppaea Sabina", "text": "Poppaea Sabina\n\nPoppaea Sabina (AD 30 – AD 65)—known as Poppaea Sabina the Younger (to differentiate her from her mother) and, after AD 63, as Poppaea Augusta Sabina—was a Roman Empress as the second wife of the Emperor Nero. She had also been wife to the future Emperor Otho. The historians of antiquity describe her as a beautiful woman who used intrigues to become empress.\n\nPoppaea Sabina the Younger was born in Pompeii in AD 30 as the daughter of Titus Ollius and Poppaea Sabina the Elder. Most evidence suggesting Poppaea's Pompeiian origins comes from the 20th century excavations of the town, destroyed in the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79. For instance, legal documents found during excavations in nearby Herculaneum described her as being the owner of a brick- or tile-work business in the Pompeii area. It is very likely that Poppaea's family came from Pompeii, and the common belief is that they might have been the owners of the Casa del Menandro (a house in Pompeii named for the painting of the 4th century BC playwright Menander that is found there).\n\nTitus Ollius was a quaestor in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius. Ollius' friendship with the infamous imperial palace guardsman Lucius Aelius Sejanus ruined him before gaining public office. Titus Ollius was from Picenum (modern Marche and Abruzzo, Italy) and he was an unknown minor character in imperial politics. Titus Ollius died in 31.\n\nPoppaea Sabina the Elder, her mother, was a distinguished woman, whom Tacitus praises as wealthy and \"the loveliest woman of her day\". In 47, she committed suicide as an innocent victim of the intrigues of the Roman Empress Valeria Messalina, having been charged with having committed adultery with former consul Decimus Valerius Asiaticus.\nThe father of Poppaea Sabina the Elder was Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus. This man of humble birth was consul in 9 and was the governor of Moesia from 12 \"-\" 35. Passed during his consulship was the Lex Papia Poppaea, a law meant to strengthen and encourage marriage. Sabinus received a military triumph for ending a revolt in Thrace in 26. From 15 until his death, he served as Imperial Proconsul (or governor) of Greece and in other provinces. This competent administrator enjoyed the friendship of the Emperors Augustus and Tiberius. He died in late December of AD 35 from natural causes. After his death, Poppaea Sabina the Younger assumed the name of her maternal grandfather.\n\nAfter Titus Ollius's death, Poppaea's mother married Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio the Elder, suffect consul, in 24. Her siblings included step-brother Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio the Younger, consul in 56, and half-brother Publius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, suffect consul in 68.\n\nPoppaea's first marriage was to Rufrius Crispinus, a man of equestrian rank. They married in 44, when Poppaea was 14 years old. He was the leader of the Praetorian Guard during the first 10 years of the reign of the Emperor Claudius until 51 when Claudius' new wife Agrippina the Younger removed him from this position. Agrippina regarded him as loyal to the deceased Messalina's memory and replaced him with Sextus Afranius Burrus. Later, under Nero, he was executed. During their marriage, Poppaea gave birth to his son, a younger Rufrius Crispinus, who, after her death, would be drowned by Nero while out on a fishing trip.\n\nPoppaea then married Otho, a good friend of the new Emperor Nero, who was seven years younger than she was. Nero fell in love with Poppaea, and she became Nero's mistress. According to Tacitus, Poppaea divorced Otho in 58 and focused her attentions solely on becoming empress of Rome and Nero's new wife. Otho was ordered away to be governor of Lusitania. (A decade later, he became emperor briefly after Nero's death in succession to Galba.) Suetonius places these events after 59.\n\nAccording to Tacitus, Poppaea was ambitious and ruthless. He reports that Poppaea married Otho to get close to Nero, and then in turn, became Nero's favorite mistress.\n\nTacitus claims that Poppaea was the reason that Nero murdered his mother. Poppaea induced Nero to murder Agrippina in 59 so that she could marry him. Modern scholars, though, question the reliability of this story as Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62. Additionally, Suetonius mentions how Poppaea's husband, Otho, was not sent away until after Agrippina's death, which makes it very unlikely that an already married woman would be pressing Nero to marry her. Some modern historians theorize that Nero's decision to kill Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set Gaius Rubellius Plautus (Nero's maternal second cousin) on the throne rather than as a result of Poppaea's motives.\n\nStill, Tacitus claims that, with Agrippina gone, Poppaea pressured Nero to divorce and later execute his first wife and stepsister Claudia Octavia in order to marry Poppaea. Octavia was initially dismissed to Campania, coincidentally the same general geographic area that Pompeii, Poppaea's place of birth, is located. She was then imprisoned on the island of Pandateria (modern Ventotene), a common place of banishment for members of the imperial family who fell from favor because of a charge of adultery. During his eight-year marriage to Claudia Octavia, Nero produced no children, and in AD 62, Poppaea became pregnant. When this happened, Nero divorced Octavia, claimed she was barren, and married Poppaea 12 days after the divorce.\n\nThe Jewish historian Josephus makes questionable claims of a very different Poppaea. He calls her a deeply religious woman who urged Nero to show compassion to the Jewish people. However, in fact, in 64 she secured the position of procurator of Judaea for Gessius Florus, her friend's husband, who was harmful to the Jews.\n\nShe bore Nero one daughter, Claudia Augusta, born on 21 January 63, who died at four months of age. At the birth of Claudia, Nero honored mother and child with the title of Augusta.\n\nThe cause and timing of Poppaea's death is uncertain. According to Suetonius, while she was awaiting the birth of her second child in the summer of 65, she quarreled fiercely with Nero over his spending too much time at the races. In a fit of rage, Nero kicked her in the abdomen, causing her death. Tacitus, on the other hand, places the death after the Quinquennial Neronia and claims Nero's kick was a \"casual outburst.\" Tacitus also mentions that some writers (now lost) claimed Nero poisoned her, though Tacitus does not believe them. Cassius Dio claims Nero leapt upon her belly, but admitted that he did not know if it was intentional or accidental.\nModern historians, though, keep in mind Suetonius', Tacitus', and Cassius Dio's severe biases against Nero and the impossibility of their knowing private events, and hence recognize that Poppaea may have died due to fatal complications of miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\nWhen Poppaea died in 65, Nero went into deep mourning. Poppaea's body was not cremated but embalmed after the Egyptian fashion. She was given a state funeral and divine honors, and entombed in an as yet unidentified \"Tomb of the Julii\". Nero supposedly burned a year's worth of Arabia's incense production at her funeral.\n\nAfter that in 67, Nero ordered Sporus, a young freedman, to be castrated and then married him; according to Cassius Dio, Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina, and Nero even called him by his dead wife’s name.\n\nAccording to Cassius Dio, Poppaea enjoyed having milk baths. She would have them daily because she was once told \"therein lurked a magic which would dispel all diseases and blights from her beauty.\"\n\nFifteen centuries after her time, Poppaea was depicted in Claudio Monteverdi's last opera \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" (\"The coronation of Poppaea\") of 1642. Her story clearly was chosen to appeal to the titillation favored in the nascent culture of the Venetian public opera theaters, and its prologue immediately explains that it is not a drama that promotes the triumph of virtue. Poppaea is portrayed as cynically plotting to become empress of Rome by manipulating the emperor Nero into marrying her, and her machinations include the execution of Seneca the Younger, who opposes her plans, which are successful at the end of the drama. \n\nPoppaea is a principal character also in Handel's opera \"Agrippina\" of 1709, but as a victim, not a perpetrator, of deceit and manipulation. Here the schemer is Agrippina, Nero's mother, intent on promoting her son's claim to the throne. Poppaea, the ingenue, is portrayed as the object of desire of Claudius, Nero, and Otho, each of whom served for a time as Roman Emperor, whose rivalries Agrippina attempts to leverage to her advantage. Once Poppaea sees through Agrippina's deceit, she responds in kind, but only in order to be united with Otho, portrayed as her one true love. \n\nPoppaea appears as a character in the several cinema and TV versions of Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel \"Quo Vadis\". In the 1951 film version - in which she is played by Patricia Laffan in a widely-praised performance - she is strangled to death by Nero, who blames her for turning his 'loyal subjects' the Roman populace against him. (This form of murder may have been suggested to the screenwriters by Tacitus' claim that Nero had made several unsuccessful attempts at strangling his first wife, Octavia, when drunk.)\n\nAnother portrayal of Poppaea is featured in the 1932 film \"The Sign of the Cross\". She is seen bathing in asses' milk. Daringly for the time, she is portrayed (by Claudette Colbert) as being openly bisexual, suggestively inviting a female slave to bathe with her in the asses' milk, but lusting after Roman soldier Marcus Superbus (Fredric March).\n\nIn the 1976 BBC TV series \"I, Claudius\", Poppaea was played by Sally Bazely.\n\nIn \"Quo vadis\", an international TV mini-series from 1985 based upon a novel by 19th-century Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, Poppaea was portrayed by Cristina Raines. \n\nKara Tointon played Poppaea in 2003's \"Boudica\", also known as \"Warrior Queen\" in the United States.\n\nPoppaea is portrayed by Catherine McCormack in the 2006 BBC docu-drama \"\". In this interpretation, she is kicked to death by Nero after offhandedly and uncritically mentioning a minor glitch during his performance at the Quinquennial Neronia. Her corpse is later shown mounted on display.\n\nRachel Yakar plays the part of Poppaea in the 1979 musical film of L'incoronazione di Poppea directed by Nikolaus Harnoncourt.\n\nIn Mel Brooks' 1968 film \"The Producers\", Leo Bloom is terrified at Max Bialystock when the large man stands over him, and, in reference to the ancient accounts of Poppaea's death, screams \"You're going to jump on me. I know you're going to jump on me – like Nero jumped on Poppaea... Poppaea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me!\"\n\nThe Gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy wrote a song titled \"Poppæa\", inspired by her story, on their myth-based album \"Aégis\".\n\n\n"}

He became a Professor's Assistant at the university. He also earned a Military Reservist degree with an Artillery Lieutenant rank. During World War 1 he served in the military and reached a rank of Artillery Captain. In 1915 he wrote his first publication about automatic weapons. After the war, Hungary was prohibited from weapon development, so he moved to Switzerland and worked for SIG Neuhausen.\nFrom 1928 weapon development was again allowed in Hungary, so Király started to develop automatic weapons for Hungary. SIG refused to release some of Király's research to Hungary as they originally agreed, so Király moved back to Hungary to work with the Danuvia Rt, but he still worked for SIG under contracts in the 1930s. During 1929-44 he was paid from the Danuvia Factory's profit sharings.\n\nIn 1945 Király escaped to Switzerland before the Soviets arrived. In 1947 he moved to the Dominican Republic, where he was employed by the Armeria of San Cristóbal, ran by a fellow Hungarian, Sándor Kovács. Király developed several weapons there, the most successful of which was his Cristóbal Carbine, of which 250,000 were sold. His last design was adopted in 1962, when he was 82.\n\nKirály's career as weapon designer had its beginnings in Switzerland, where he emigrated after World War I. In the 1920s he developed the SIG KE 7 machine gun and the SIG MKMO machine-carbine. The MKMO (and its shortened variant, MKPO) was successfully sold to various countries in 7.63mm and 9mm Mauser and 7.65mm and 9mm Parabellum chamberings.\n\nIn 1929 Király designed an advanced 9×19mm pistol, designated the 'KD Danuvia' of which 20 guns were manufactured for trials.\n\nKirály's most significant development is the lever-delayed blowback working principle, successfully applied in many of his designs. Examples are the machine carbines Danuvia 39.M and Danuvia 43.M, and it is also used in the French FAMAS assault rifle.\nIn 1932 Király designed a self-loading (automatic rifle), which was the first automatic rifle in the world utilizing a muzzle brake (The more famous Simonov Model 1936 featured the first muzzle brake outside Hungary, 4 years later). The Király rifle was very well balanced and weighed less than . It had a well-sealed, dust-proof operating mechanism and came with a small 10-round box magazine.\n\nIn 1933 Király introduced a larger version of his 1932 automatic rifle. This gun weighed , had a heavier and longer barrel, a large 80-round magazine and a muzzle brake.\n\nIn July 1934, the Italians reviewed Danuvia's available arsenal, showed interest, but eventually decided to stay with their own weapons, except for the 12.7mm Gebauer GKM, to which the Italians had no equivalent.\n\nIn 1938, BSA in the United Kingdom acquired the blueprints for Pál Király's submachine gun/machine carbine as well as the rights to manufacture it. Examples were produced in 9mm Mauser Export caliber according to Király's design. BSA estimated that these arms would only cost 5 pounds each to manufacture. However, in the UK, military officials viewed submachine guns as \"gangster weapons\" and therefore inappropriate for regular troops. Plans to manufacture it were shelved.\n\nIn 1939 the Honvédség adopted Király's machine carbine with the Danuvia 39.M designation. A modernized version was adopted in 1943 under the Danuvia 43.M designation. His last Hungarian design, designated Danuvia 44.M was not adopted due to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. His 44.M design was the basis of the Hungarian Kucher K1 Machine Pistol in 1951.\nHe designed the Danuvia 39M and improved it into the Danuvia 43M Submachine gun.\n\nAfter he moved to the Dominican Republic, he designed the .30 Kiraly-Cristobal carbine, which was essentially a copy of his earlier work, specifically the 44M (an improved 43M). He made two more Cristobal carbine versions, the delayed blowback M2 (Cristobal Automatic Carbine) in .30 Carbine and the gas-operated M3 in 7.62×51mm NATO. He patented the latter in 1961 as a competitor to the Belgian FN FAL. His .30 Carbine M2 model was manufactured in about 200,000 exemplars between 1950 and 1966, and \"it remained in service until the late 1980s or early 1990s\". Although a semi-automatic weapon, its design was \"more akin to submachine guns such as the Beretta Model 38 and the Hungarian 39M.\"\n\n"}

He helped develop the video tape recorder while at Ampex and was the founder of Dolby Laboratories.\n\nDolby was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Esther Eufemia (née Strand) and Earl Milton Dolby, an inventor. He attended Sequoia High School (class of 1951) in Redwood City, California. As a teenager in the decade following World War II, he held part-time and summer jobs at Ampex in Redwood City, working with their first audio tape recorder in 1949. While at San Jose State College and later at Stanford University (interrupted by two years of Army service), he worked on early prototypes of video tape recorder technologies for Alexander M. Poniatoff and Charlie Ginsburg. As a non degree-holding \"consultant\", Dolby played a key role in the effort that led Ampex to unveil their prototype Quadruplex videotape recorder in April 1956 which soon entered production.\n\nIn 1957, Dolby received his B.S. in electrical engineering from Stanford. He subsequently won a Marshall Scholarship for a Ph.D (1961) in physics from the University of Cambridge, where he was a Research Fellow at Pembroke College.\n\nAfter Cambridge, Dolby acted as a technical advisor to the United Nations in India, until 1965 when he returned to England, where he founded Dolby Laboratories in London with a staff of four. In that same year, 1965, he officially invented the Dolby Sound System, a form of audio signal processing. His first U.S. patent was not filed until 1969, four years later. The filter was first used by Decca Records in the UK.\n\nDolby was a Fellow and past president of the Audio Engineering Society.\n\nDolby died of leukemia on September 12, 2013, at his home in San Francisco at the age of 80. Dolby was survived by his wife Dagmar, two sons, Tom and David, and four grandchildren. Kevin Yeaman, president and chief executive of Dolby Laboratories, said \"Today we lost a friend, mentor and true visionary.\" Neil Portnow, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, said Dolby had \"changed the way we listen to music and movies for nearly 50 years\" and that Dolby's \"technologies have become an essential part of the creative process for recording artists and filmmakers, ensuring his remarkable legacy for generations to come.\"\n\nIn his will, Dolby bequeathed more than $52 million to Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge, the largest single donation received by the University's current fundraising campaign. In December 2017 it was announced that his family has donated a further £85m from his estate to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory. \n\nThe analog Dolby B noise-reduction system works by compressing and increasing the volume of low-level high-frequency sounds during recording and correspondingly reverses the process during playback. This high-frequency round turn reduces the audible level of tape hiss.\n\n\n\n"}

His 1956 novel \"The Lonely Londoners\" is groundbreaking in its use of creolised English, or \"nation language\", for narrative as well as dialogue.\n\nSamuel Dickson Selvon was born in San Fernando in the south of Trinidad, and is the sixth of seven children. His parents were Indian: his father was a first-generation Christian immigrant from Madras and his mother was a Christian Anglo-Indian. His maternal grandfather was Scottish and his maternal grandmother was Indian. He was educated at Naparima College, San Fernando, before leaving at the age of 15 to work. He was a wireless operator with the local branch of the Royal Naval Reserve from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War. Thereafter, he moved north to Port of Spain, and from 1945 to 1950, worked for the \"Trinidad Guardian\" as a reporter and for a time on its literary page. In this period, he began writing stories and descriptive pieces, mostly under a variety of pseudonyms including Michael Wentworth, Esses, Ack-Ack, and Big Buffer. Much of this early writing is to be found in \"Foreday Morning\" (eds Kenneth Ramchand and Susheila Nasta, 1989).\n\nSelvon moved to London, England, in the 1950s, where he worked as a clerk for the Indian Embassy, while writing in his spare time. His short stories and poetry appeared in various publications, including the \"London Magazine\", \"New Statesman\", and \"The Nation\". In London he also worked with the BBC, producing two television scripts, \"Anansi the Spiderman\", and \"Home Sweet India\".\n\nSelvon was a fellow in creative writing at the University of Dundee from 1975 until 1977. In the late 1970s Selvon moved to Alberta, Canada, and found a job teaching creative writing as a visiting professor at the University of Victoria. When that job ended, he took a job as a janitor at the University of Calgary in Alberta for a few months before becoming writer-in-residence there. He was largely ignored by the Canadian literary establishment, with his works receiving no reviews during his residency.\n\nOn a return trip to Trinidad Selvon died of respiratory failure due to extensive bronchopneumonia and chronic lung disease on 16 April 1994 at Piarco International Airport; his ashes were subsequently interred at the University of the West Indies cemetery, St Augustine, Trinidad.\n\nSelvon married twice: in 1947 to Draupadi Persaud, with whom he had one daughter, and in 1963 to Althea Daroux, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.\n\nSelvon is best known for his novels \"The Lonely Londoners\" (1956) and \"Moses Ascending\" (1975). His novel \"A Brighter Sun\" (1952), detailing the construction of the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway in Trinidad through the eyes of young Indian worker Tiger, was a popular choice on the CXC English Literature syllabus for many years. Other notable works include the collection of stories \"Ways of Sunlight\" (1957), \"Turn Again Tiger\" (1958) and \"Those Who Eat the Cascadura\" (1972). During the 1970s and early 1980s, Selvon converted several of his novels and stories into radio scripts, broadcast by the BBC, which were collected in \"Eldorado West One\" (Peepal Tree Press, 1988) and \"Highway in the Sun\" (Peepal Tree Press, 1991).\n\n\"The Lonely Londoners\", like most of Selvon's later work, focuses on the migration of West Indians to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, and tells, mostly in anecdotal form, the daily experience of settlers from Africa and the Caribbean. Selvon also illustrates the panoply of different subcultures that exist within London, as with any major city, due to class and racial boundaries. In many ways, his books are the precursors to works such as \"White Teeth\" by Zadie Smith and \"The Buddha of Suburbia\" by Hanif Kureishi. Selvon explained: \n\"When I wrote the novel that became \"The Lonely Londoners\", I tried to recapture a certain quality in West Indian everyday life. I had in store a number of wonderful anecdotes and could put them into focus, but I had difficulty starting the novel in straight English. The people I wanted to describe were entertaining people indeed, but I could not really move. At that stage, I had written the narrative in English and most of the dialogues in dialect. Then I started both narrative and dialogue in dialect and the novel just shot along.\"\n\nSelvon's papers are now at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin, USA. These consist of holograph manuscripts, typescripts, book proofs, manuscript notebooks, and correspondence. Drafts for six of his 11 novels are present, along with supporting correspondence and items relating to his career.\n\nSelvon was awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships (in 1955 and 1968), an honorary doctorate from Warwick University in 1989, and in 1985 the honorary degree of DLitt by the University of the West Indies. In 1969 he was awarded the Trinidad & Tobago Hummingbird Medal Gold for Literature, and in 1994 he was (posthumously) given another national award, the Chaconia Medal Gold for Literature. In 2012 he was honoured with a NALIS Lifetime Achievement Literary Award for his contributions to Trinidad and Tobago's literature.\n\n\n\nCritical works on Selvon include:\n\n"}

(The area today is known as Library.) He was the youngest of four children of William and Nancy Rigdon. Rigdon's father was a farmer and a native of Harford County, Maryland.\n\nSidney's father William Rigdon died in 1810.\n\nAccording to an 1875 account attributed to Sidney Rigdon's elder brother, as a child Rigdon had suffered an accident that caused a \"contusion of the brain\". His brother reportedly claimed that he \"always considered Sidney a little deranged in his mind by that accident. His mental powers did not seem to be impaired, but the equilibrium in his intellectual exertions seemed thereby to have been sadly affected. He still manifested great mental activity and power, but he was to an equal degree inclined to run into wild and visionary views on almost every question.\" This account was not published until more than 60 years after the accident.\n\nAccording to an account by his son John M. Rigdon, young Rigdon \"borrowed all the histories he could get and began to read them. ... In this way he became a great historian, the best I ever saw. He seemed to have the history of the world on his tongue's end and he got to be a great biblical scholar as well. He was as familiar with the Bible as a child was with his spelling book. He was never known to play with the boys; reading books was the greatest pleasure he could get. He studied English Grammar alone and became a very fine grammarian. He was very precise in his language.\"\n\nRigdon remained on the farm until his mother sold it in 1818.\n\nOn May 31, 1817, Rigdon was baptized by Rev. Phillips and he became a member of the Peter's Creek Baptist Church of Library, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1818, Rigdon moved to North Sewickley to become an apprentice to Baptist minister Rev. Andrew Clark. Rigdon received his license to preach for the Regular Baptists in March 1819.\n\nRigdon moved in May to Trumbull County, Ohio, where he jointly preached with Adamson Bentley from July 1819. He married Bentley's wife's sister, Phoebe Brooks in June 1820, and remained in Ohio until February 1822, when he returned to Pittsburgh to accept the pastorate of the First Baptist Church there under the recommendation of Alexander Campbell.\n\nRigdon and Bentley had journeyed to meet Campbell in the summer of 1821, to learn more about the Baptist who was encountering opposition to his idea that the New Testament should hold priority over the Old Testament in the Christian church. They engaged in lengthy discussions, with both men joining the Disciples of Christ movement associated with Campbell.\n\nOn January 28, 1822, Rigdon arrived in Pittsburgh to become minister at the First Baptist Church. Rigdon's ministry met with opposition from member Rev. John Winter, and on July 11, 1823, a schism split the congregation, with each side disfellowshipping the other. On October 11, Rigdon was \"excluded from the Redstone Association Baptist Denomination\", of which the First Baptist Church was a member.\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, Rigdon worked as a journeyman tanner in Pittsburgh, while preaching Campbell's Restorationism on Sundays in the courthouse. In 1826, Rigdon became the pastor of the more liberal Baptist church in Mentor, Ohio in the Western Reserve.\n\nMany prominent early Latter Day Saint leaders, including Parley P. Pratt, Isaac Morley and Edward Partridge, were members of Rigdon's congregations prior to their conversion to the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) founded by Joseph Smith.\n\nIn early September 1830, Rigdon's associate, Pratt, was baptized into the Church of Christ founded by Smith (later known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints). In October, Pratt and Ziba Peterson began a mission to preach to the American Indians.\n\nThey visited Rigdon in Ohio. Rigdon read the Book of Mormon, proclaimed its truthfulness, and was baptized into the church. He proceeded to convert hundreds of members of his Ohio congregations. In December 1830, Rigdon traveled to New York, where he met Smith.\n\nRigdon was a fiery orator and he was immediately called by Smith to be the spokesman for the church. He also served as a scribe and helped with Smith's re-translation of the Bible.\n\nRigdon reportedly received visions jointly with Smith. According to one account: \"Joseph would, at intervals, say: 'What do I see?' as one might say while looking out the window and beholding what all in the room could not see. Then he would relate what he had seen or what he was looking at. Then Sidney replied, 'I see the same.' Presently Sidney would say 'what do I see?' and would repeat what he had seen or was seeing, and Joseph would reply, 'I see the same.' This manner of conversation was repeated at short intervals to the end of the vision\".\n\nIn December 1830, Smith said he received a revelation counseling members of the church in New York to gather to Kirtland, Ohio. Many of the doctrines Rigdon's group had experimented with found place in the combined movement, such as living with all things in common.\nIn August 1831, Smith announced that he had received a revelation admonishing Rigdon for exalting himself: \"And now behold, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, am not pleased with my servant Sidney Rigdon; he exalted himself in his heart, and received not counsel, but grieved the Spirit; Wherefore his writing is not acceptable unto the Lord, and he shall make another; and if the Lord receive it not, behold he standeth no longer in the office to which I have appointed him. ... Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips—For behold, verily I say, that many there be who are under this condemnation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority. Wherefore, let the church repent of their sins, and I, the Lord, will own them otherwise they shall be cut off.\"\n\nSmith relocated to Hiram, Ohio, in September 1831. Smith and Rigdon were tarred and feathered at the John Johnson Farm on March 24, 1832. Smith recorded: \"The next morning I went to see elder Rigdon, and found him crazy, and his head highly inflamed, for they had dragged him by his heels, and those too, so high from the earth he could not raise his head from the rough frozen surface, which lascerated it exceedingly; and when he saw me he called to his wife to bring him his razor. She asked him what he wanted of it? and he replied to kill me. Sister Rigdon left the room, and he asked me to bring his razor. I asked him what he wanted of it, and he replied he wanted to kill his wife, and he continued delirious some days.\"\n\n\nOn July 5, 1832, Rigdon taught that \"the keys of the kingdom were taken from us. On hearing this, many of his hearers wept, and when some one undertook to dismiss the meeting by prayer he said praying would do them no good, and the meeting broke up in confusion.\"\n\nIn response, Hyrum Smith traveled to retrieve Joseph Smith, who returned to Kirtland on July 7. Joseph Smith rebuked Rigdon, and publicly prophesied that \"[n]o power can pluck those keys from me, except the power that gave them to me; But for what Sidney has done, the devil shall handle him as one man handles another.\"\n\nReportedly, \"About three weeks after this, Sidney was lying on his bed alone. An unseen power lifted him from his bed, threw him across the room, and tossed him from one side of the room to the other. The noise being heard in the adjoining room, his family went in to see what was the matter, and found him going from one side of the room to the other, from the effects of which Sidney was laid up for five or six weeks. Thus was Joseph's prediction in regard to him verified. \"\n\nOn July 28, Smith re-ordained Rigdon to the high priesthood for \"the Second time\" after Rigdon had \"repented like Peter of old.\"\n\n\nWhen Smith organized the church's First Presidency, he set apart Jesse Gause and Rigdon as his first two counselors. Smith and Rigdon became close partners, and Rigdon tended to supplant Oliver Cowdery, the original \"Second Elder\" of the church.\n\nRigdon became a strong advocate of the construction of the Kirtland Temple. When the church founded the Kirtland Safety Society, Rigdon became the bank's president and Smith served as its cashier. When the bank failed in 1837, Rigdon and Smith were both blamed by Mormon dissenters.\n\nRigdon and Smith moved to Far West, Missouri and established a new church headquarters there.\n\nAccording to one report, while the Mormons were encamped at Adam-ondi-Ahman, Rigdon criticized Smith and others who were engaged in recreational wrestling on Sunday. Rigdon reportedly \"rushed into the ring, sword in hand, and said that he would not suffer a lot of men to break the Sabbath day in that manner.\" Smith \"dragged him from the ring, bareheaded, and tore Rigdon's fine pulpit coat from the collar to the waist\". Reportedly, \"after that Rigdon never countermanded the orders of the Prophet, to my knowledge—he knew who was boss.\"\n\nAs spokesman for the First Presidency, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the Salt Sermon and the July 4th Oration. These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri.\n\nAs a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in Liberty Jail. Rigdon was released on a writ of \"habeas corpus\" and made his way to Illinois, where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839.\n\nSmith and his followers were allowed to escape from Liberty Jail in Missouri as ordered by Lt. Governor Boggs, and so they were released by a sheriff on their way to stand trial. Smith went on to found the city of Nauvoo, Illinois. Rigdon continued to act as church spokesman and gave a speech at the ground-breaking of the Nauvoo Temple. On June 1, 1841, Sidney Rigdon was ordained as a \"Prophet, Seer and Revelator\".\n\nHowever, Smith and Rigdon's relationship began to deteriorate in Nauvoo. Rigdon's participation in church administrative affairs became minimal. He did not reside in Nauvoo and served in a local church presidency in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also in poor health.\n\nIn October, 1843, a Special Conference was called to consider \"the case and standing of Elder Sidney Rigdon\".\n\nJoseph Smith \"stated his dissatisfaction\" with Rigdon. Charges were leveled that Rigdon had correspondence \"of a treacherous nature\" with John C. Bennett, former Governor Carlin, and \"the Missourians\". Rigdon was also accused to \"leaguing with dishonest persons in endeavoring to defraud the innocent\". In \"indirect testimony\" from Porter Rockwell's mother, Rigdon was accused of having had been responsible for informing others about Smith's visit to Dixon and instructing them to arrest him while there.\n\nSmith told the conference that, in light of the charges, Smith requested Rigdon be replaced as First Counselor.\n\nThe \"Times and Seasons\" and the \"History of the Church\" both record that Rigdon addressed the conference, denied the charges and made a \"moving appeal\"; they record \"the sympathies of the congregation were highly excited\". A vote was called and the congregation held that Rigdon would be permitted to retain his position.\n\nAccording to the \"Times and Seasons\", Smith had \"wholly removed suspicion from elder Sidney Rigdon\" and \"expressed entire willingness to have elder Sidney Rigdon retain his station\", despite a \"lack of confidence in his integrity and steadfastness, judging from their past intercourse\". Alternately, the \"History of the Church\" records that Smith replied to the vote by saying, \"I have thrown him off my shoulders, and you have again put him on me. You may carry him, but I will not.\"\n\nWhen Smith began his campaign for the presidency of the United States in 1844, Rigdon was selected as his vice-presidential running mate. After Smith's death, Rigdon was the senior surviving member of the First Presidency. (The other members were John Smith, who was an assistant counselor, and Amasa Lyman, who was a counselor.) During this time, Rigdon was strongly opposed to polygamy and other innovations within the church.\n\nJoseph Smith was killed in 1844. Prior to Smith's death, the First Presidency had made nearly all the major decisions for the church. In 1841, Rigdon had been ordained by Smith as a \"Prophet, Seer and Revelator\", as had all other members of the First Presidency and of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church.\n\nRigdon returned to Nauvoo on August 3, and the next day he announced at a public meeting that he had received a revelation appointing him \"Guardian of the Church.\" The President of the central stake, William Marks, supported Rigdon.\n\nAt an August 8 conference, Rigdon argued that he should be made the \"Protector\" of the church.\" Brigham Young, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles opposed this motion and asserted a claim for the primacy of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The Quorum of Twelve Apostles were scattered throughout the United States and Europe at the time of Smith's death. The members of the quorum available in Illinois, in addition to a gathered assembly, voted to deny Rigdon his claim for church leadership. Rigdon felt this action was done without proper order.\n\nOne month later, on September 8, Rigdon was excommunicated from the church by a Common Council of the Church which had been convened by Presiding Bishop Newel K. Whitney. Rigdon refused to attend this trial after which he, in turn, likewise excommunicated the members of the Twelve. Rigdon fled Nauvoo, claiming that he felt threatened by Young's supporters.\n\nAfter the succession schism, Rigdon solidified and led an independent faction of Latter Day Saints, originally called the \"Church of Christ\", but at one point was called as the Church of Jesus Christ of the Children of Zion. This sect is often referred to as the Rigdonites. The Latter Day Saints who followed Rigdon separated themselves and settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On April 6, 1845, Rigdon presided over a conference of the Church of Christ, which he claimed was the rightful continuation of the church founded by Smith. He then reorganized the First Presidency and called his own Quorum of Twelve Apostles.\n\nAlthough Rigdon's church briefly flourished through the publication of his periodical, \"The Messenger and Advocate,\" quarrels among the Rigdonites led most members of the church to desert the senior leader by 1847. A few loyalists, notably William Bickerton, eventually reorganized the church in 1862 under the name The Church of Jesus Christ.\n\nRigdon lived on for many years in Pennsylvania and New York. He maintained his testimony of the Book of Mormon and clung to his claims that he was the rightful heir to Joseph Smith. He died in Friendship, New York.\n\nFollowing the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, a succession crisis led to schisms within the movement. The Brigham Young branch traveled west to Utah, while Rigdon traveled eastward to Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with more than 16 million members, is the largest existing Mormon denomination. Its members consider Young to be the successor to Joseph Smith.\n\nRigdon's branch faced less success, modernly accounting for only a small fraction of practicing Latter Day Saints.\n\nRigdon has been named as a potential author for the Book of Mormon. According to this theory, Rigdon obtained from a Pittsburgh publisher a manuscript for a historical novel written by Solomon Spalding, and by reworking it and adding a theological component, had created the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe theory that Sidney Rigdon was the true author of the Book of Mormon first appeared in print in an August 31, 1831, article by James Gordon Bennett, who had visited Palmyra/Manchester area and interviewed several residents. The theory of Rigdon's use of a Spalding manuscript first appeared in print in the 1834 book \"Mormonism Unvailed\". The theory also later appeared in 1867 in \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism\" by Pomeroy Tucker in which he says Smith was visited by a \"mysterious stranger\" as early as 1827, who Tucker implies played a role in the creation of the Book of Mormon and later identifies the stranger as Rigdon.\n\nThis theory contradicts the testimony of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to his death and long after he had ceased an affiliation with any of the sects of Mormonism: \"My father, after I had finished saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have told you about the origin of [the Book of Mormon] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew about the origin of [the Book of Mormon] was what Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and the witnesses who claimed they saw the plates have told me, and in all of my intimacy with Joseph Smith he never told me but one story.'\" However, Rigdon's grandson, Walter Sidney Rigdon, stated in an interview that the family knew that the \"Golden Bible\" was a hoax, contrived by Rigdon and Joseph Smith Junior, to make money and that it was based on the Spalding manuscript.\n\nA 2008 computer analysis of the Book of Mormon text supports this theory, although the study does not include Joseph Smith in the author sample on the ground that few pure examples of Smith's writings are extant. Several other significant problems are apparent in the methodology of this computer analysis, specifically the use of closed set methodology instead of open set methodology. For example, the original methodology, when replicated, also assigns Rigdon as the probable author of \"The Federalist Papers\", which were written five years before his birth.\n\n"}

One of the most demanding aspects of many tower climber jobs is hauling materials and tools up to the proper installation height on the tower. In most cases, the climber scales the tower to the desired height and lowers a rope to a ground crew member who then ties it to a needed part on the ground. The tower worker then pulls the piece up and secures the rope before installing the part onto the tower.\n\nTower climbers may be injured or killed by falling objects, structural collapses and equipment failures. Some of the more frequently encountered hazards include falls from great heights; electrical hazards; hazards associated with hoisting personnel and equipment with base-mounted drum hoists; inclement weather; and structural collapse of towers.\n\nWorking on cellphone towers is the deadliest job in the United States, according to a trade publication, and it has been claimed that the tower climbing industry experiences 10 times more death casualties than the construction workers. There were 50 - 100 deaths from falls from communication towers between 2003 and 2011. The head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) once called tower climbing “the most dangerous job in America.”\n"}

The person directing traffic is responsible for maintaining the safety and efficiency of traffic, as well as the safety of road workers, while allowing construction, accident recovery or other tasks to proceed. Traffic guards are commonly used to control traffic when two way roads are reduced to one lane, and traffic must alternate. Their duties are to direct traffic to safer areas where construction or traffic incidents are taking place. In addition they have to moderate the traffic density to not cause traffic jams. They guide motorists to follow the traffic laws; but may not be able to enforce the law. Most traffic guards are seen as construction workers; but in some nations, they dress or perform as security guards and police officers.\n\n\nTraffic guards are employed on highways and expressways. They are trained to set up warning signs and barricades to slow down the speed of traffic in a temporary traffic control zone. Some areas have full-time traffic guard teams for responding to incidents that could risk the safety to motorists. When they are on scene they will set up equipment to warn approaching traffic about the incident.\n\n\nIf construction or maintenance is occurring in an intersection and a law enforcement officer is not used to direct traffic, a traffic guard would control the intersection instead of the traffic light or signs.\n\n\nTraffic guards who are directing traffic during road construction often alternate opposing traffic through a single lane. One direction of traffic is stopped at a time.\n\nCrossings\n\nTraffic guards who are stationed at a crossing with no signal or placed for extra safety at a junction. They stop pedestrians and vehicles from crossing a junction where another thing has the right of way to cross.\n\n\nThese traffic guards are waiting for motorists to leave and enter a complex. They also help pedestrians cross or stop them in front of the complex's entrance. They act as second pair of eyes to keep motorists and pedestrians safe. They may direct street traffic to stop for exiting motorists from the complex and they may not allow in doing that.\n\n\n"}
