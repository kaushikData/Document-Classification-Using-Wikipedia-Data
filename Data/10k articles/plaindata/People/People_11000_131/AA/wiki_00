Ballou has cerebral palsy as a result of an intrauterine stroke, he was diagnosed at six months old. He attended James Madison University, graduating in 2015. He started playing soccer when he was 3 years old, played rec, advanced and travel. He also played on his high school varsity team, and was team captain his junior and senior years.\n\nBallou has been a consistent member of the United States Paralympic National Team since being invited to train with them in March 2007 as a 14-years-old. He has competed at the CP Football World Championships in 2009, 2011, and 2015. He has also represented the United States at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. His best performance with the team was a second-place finish at the 2010 Americas Championship.\n\nBallou was born on May 29, 1992 in Virginia Beach, Virginia and has three sisters. Ballou was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was six months old, after he had a pediatric stroke. As a result of the stroke, when he was an infant, doctors told his parents that he might live his life as a vegetable. The stroke had resulted in him acquiring cerebral palsy and having limited limb functionality on his left side, making it substantially weaker than his right side. To address these physical issues, Ballou had regular physical therapy as a result until he was around a 13-year-old.\n\nBallou attended Norfolk Christian High School in Norfolk, graduating from there in 2011. He went on from there to study International Affairs and Spanish at James Madison University. He graduated in 2015, with a minors in business as well as Latin American and Caribbean Studies. While attending university, he took the spring semester of 2012 off so he could train with the US national team ahead of the London Games. He also studied abroad, spending a semester in Salamanca, Spain. In 2014, he completed an internship for U.S. State Department at the Embassy in Madrid in 2014 as part of his studies. He has continued to be involved with the university following his graduation. In April 2016, he gave a workshop on Paralympic sport at his alma mater's Godwin Hall in Harrisonburg \n\nBallou speaks Spanish and English. He is 5 foot 8 and weighs 155 pounds.\n\nBallou started playing soccer when he was a 3-year-old, playing for a team that included his sister and which his father was the coach of. He was able to compete in sports after he had a tendon transfer on his left foot. Many people in his life encouraged him to participate in sports. Because of his disability, he trained harder on that side of the body and sometimes feels he performs better on that side as a result. He played varsity soccer for Norfolk Christian High School. In 2012, his soccer coaches were Jay Hoffman and Mike Haas.\n\nBallou is a CP7 footballer and a regular fixture on the US National Paralympic Team, where he plays in the midfield.\n\nBallou started playing CP football in 2007 after getting invited to train with the national team in March. At the time, he was a 14-years-old. He came to the attention of national selectors after the head coach of the Virginia Beach Mariners asked his coach if he knew of any players with cerebral palsy and his coach replied with Ballou's name and contact details. Because of the rules for CP football, he was not able to earn his first national team cap until he was a 16-years-old.\n\nThe United States tried but failed to qualify for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. If they had been successful, Ballou would likely have made the roster. He continued his national team career, and was part of the US team that finished 11th at the 2009 World Championships. He continued to get national team calls ups, and was with the US team that finished second at the 2010 Americas Championship. The following year, he participated in the 2011 CPISRA World Championships with the national team. An eighth-place finish at this tournament qualified the United States for the London Games.\n\nBallou spent a lot of time preparing for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. When not with the national team, he trained at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex. Having taken a semester off to prepare for the Games, he spent a lot of time in 2012 training with the national team in Chula Vista, California and was formally chosen by national team head coach Jay Hoffman to be on the London bound national team.\n\nThe 2012 Games were his first, as the national team had not qualified for Beijing. Ballou was one of seven US Paralympians from Virginia competing in London, and his family flew to London to watch him play. Lots of people came to watch the Games, with 80,000 people showing up to the opening ceremonies and 25,000 people showing up to watch his team play Great Britain. The United States was drawn in Group B with Ukraine, Great Britain and Brazil. The Americans did not win a single game, losing all 5 matches they played in. After the Games when he returned to the USA, he was with the team when they met US President Barack Obama. His participation in London gave him the resolve to try to make the roster for the 2016 Games.\n\nIn April 2014, Ballou was invited to participate in a week long national team training camp at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. The camp was being held in preparation for the 7-a-side Football Ciutat de Barcelona in June of that year. In March 2015, he was part of the 14 man roster that participated in the Povoa de Varzim, Portugal hosted Footie 7 – Povoa 2015 tournament. The competition was a warmup for the World Championships that were held in England in June 2015.\n\nBallou was named to the US side for the 2015 Cerebral Palsy World Championships in England in June 2015. Ballou came off the bench to substitute in for Michael Moore in the team's 10 - 0 loss to England. He started in the team's 2 - 1 win against Scotland. In the 7th/8th placement match, Argentine goalkeeper Gustavo Nahuelquin was red carded for kicking Ballou. Teammate David Garza then scored on the penalty kick. Ballou scored his own goal later in the game against Argentina. The United States won the game 4 - 1. This performance qualified the United States for the 2016 Summer Paralympics.\n\nAgain, Ballou was called to participate on the national team after being named to the 14 man squad for the 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto. There, the United States played Canada, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. He played in the team's match against Canada. He spent parts of 2015 and 2016 training full-time in preparation for the Rio Games.\n\nLater that year, Ballou was nominated for the 2015 U.S. Soccer’s Young Disabled Player of the Year alongside teammate Kevin Hensley and US national amputee football team players Nicolai Calabria and Noah Grove. He lost out Hensley in getting the honor.\n\n2016 saw Ballou again getting invitations to play with the US Paralympic Team. He participated national team training camp in Chula Vista, California in early March 2016. Following that, Ballou was part of the US that took part in the 2016 Pre Paralympic Tournament in Salou, Spain. The United States finished 6th after beating Argentina in one placement match 4 - 3 and losing to Ireland 4 - 1. The goals scored in the match against Argentina were the first the USA scored in the tournament, before putting up one more in their match against Ireland. Ballou scored an own goal in the USA's game against Ireland. The tournament featured 7 of the 8 teams participating in Rio. It was the last major preparation event ahead of the Rio Games for all teams participating.\n"}

In 2004, he represented Australia in the International Rules Series. Embley was one of West Coast's vice-captains between 2004 and 2006, and played a key part in West Coast's victory over in the 2006 AFL Grand Final.

He was nominated for the 2000 AFL Rising Star for his efforts against in round 14.\n\nWith John Worsfold having replaced Ken Judge as coach of the club prior to the start of the 2002 season, Embley established himself as a regular part of the Eagles' line-up over the next two seasons, playing in losing elimination finals in both the 2003 and 2004 finals series. He kicked 31 goals in 2003 to finish second in the Eagles' goalkicking behind Phil Matera (62 goals). A 25-disposal, four-goal game against in round eight, 2003, earnt him three Brownlow Medal votes, the first of his career. Embley was named vice-captain of West Coast for the 2004 season, and also represented Australia in that year's International Rules Series. Embley played 18 games for the Eagles in the 2005 season, including all of the Eagles' finals and the Grand Final loss to . He played 23 out of a possible 24 games in the Eagles' 2006 season, playing mainly across the half-forward line and wings. Embley also kicked 31 goals for the season to be the club's second leading-goalkicker behind Quinten Lynch (65 goals). Despite injuries late in the season, Embley played a key role in the team's successful final series. He averaged 26 possessions and kicked five goals across the Eagles' three finals matches, despite playing the semi-final against the with a paralysed vocal chord. He took a game-saving mark in the preliminary final against in a game the Eagles won by 10 points. He was awarded the 2006 Norm Smith Medal as the best-on-ground player in the Eagles' Grand Final win over for his 26-disposal, two-goal effort.\n\nEmbley played only 13 out of a possible 24 games during the 2007 season, missing seven games between rounds 6 and 12 and four games at the end of the season due to a hamstring injury. He was dropped as Eagles vice-captain for the 2007 season. Embley played 42 out of a possible 44 games during the 2008 and 2009 seasons in a shift to a more midfield role. He played his 150th game for the Eagles against the in Round 6, 2008 in a 60-point loss, earning life membership of the club.

Embley played 20 games in 2010, including his 200th game in the AFL against in Round 10. After a strong pre-season, Embley started the 2011 season with two best-on-ground efforts against and , receiving some credit for West Coast's strong start to the season after a wooden spoon the previous year. The round eight Western Derby against was the only match Embley missed through the entire season, playing 24 out of a possible 25 games, and also recording several personal bests, including career-high numbers in disposals, tackles, and Brownlow votes.\n\nIn the 2012 NAB Cup, Embley injured his left shoulder, but played the first two games of the regular season before opting to have surgery, missing much of the Eagles' season as a result. He returned to football via Swan Districts, his first WAFL match since the 2002 season.

He also struggled for consistency during the season—of his eleven matches during the season, he played three consecutive matches only once. Embley spent portions of the season in the WAFL, averaging 23 disposals over five games for Swan Districts. When he did play for West Coast, he was often used as substitute, especially towards the end of the season.

{"id": "237186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237186", "title": "Charles Fourier", "text": "Charles Fourier\n\nFrançois Marie Charles Fourier (; ; 7 April 1772 – 10 October 1837) was a French philosopher, influential early socialist thinker and one of the founders of utopian socialism. Some of Fourier's social and moral views, held to be radical in his lifetime, have become mainstream thinking in modern society. For instance, Fourier is credited with having originated the word \"feminism\" in 1837.\n\nFourier's social views and proposals inspired a whole movement of intentional communities. Among them in the United States were the community of Utopia, Ohio; La Reunion near present-day Dallas, Texas; the North American Phalanx in Red Bank, New Jersey; Brook Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts; the Community Place and Sodus Bay Phalanx in New York State; Silkville, Kansas in Kansas; and several others. Fourier later inspired a diverse array of revolutionary thinkers and writers.\n\nFourier was born in Besançon, France on 7 April 1772. The son of a small businessman, Fourier was more interested in architecture than in his father's trade. He wanted to become an engineer, but the local military engineering school accepted only sons of noblemen. Fourier later said he was grateful that he did not pursue engineering, because it would have consumed too much of his time and taken away from his true desire to help humanity.\n\nWhen his father died in 1781, Fourier received two-fifths of his father's estate, valued at more than 200,000 francs. This inheritance enabled Fourier to travel throughout Europe at his leisure. In 1791 he moved from Besançon to Lyon, where he was employed by the merchant M. Bousquet. Fourier's travels also brought him to Paris, where he worked as the head of the Office of Statistics for a few months. From 1791 to 1816 Fourier was employed in Paris, Rouen, Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux. As a traveling salesman and correspondence clerk, his research and thought was time-limited: he complained of \"serving the knavery of merchants\" and the stupefaction of \"deceitful and degrading duties.\" He took up writing, and his first book was published in 1808 but it only sold few copies. Surprisingly, after six years the book fell into the hands of Monsieur Just Muiron who eventually became Fourier's patron. Fourier produced most of his writings between 1816 and 1821. In 1822, he tried to sell his books again but with no success.\n\nFourier died in Paris in 1837.\n\nFourier declared that concern and cooperation were the secrets of social success. He believed that a society that cooperated would see an immense improvement in their productivity levels. Workers would be recompensed for their labors according to their contribution. Fourier saw such cooperation occurring in communities he called \"phalanxes,\" based upon structures called Phalanstères or \"grand hotels\". These buildings were four-level apartment complexes where the richest had the uppermost apartments and the poorest had a ground-floor residence. Wealth was determined by one's job; jobs were assigned based on the interests and desires of the individual. There were incentives: jobs people might not enjoy doing would receive higher pay. Fourier considered trade, which he associated with Jews, to be the \"source of all evil\" and advocated that Jews be forced to perform farm work in the phalansteries. By the end of his life, Fourier advocated the return of Jews to Palestine with the assistance of the Rothschilds. John K. Roth and Richard L. Rubenstein have seen Fourier as motivated by economic and religious antisemitism, rather than the racial antisemitism that would emerge later in the century.\n\nFourier characterized poverty (not inequality) as the principal cause of disorder in society, and he proposed to eradicate it by sufficiently high wages and by a \"decent minimum\" for those who were not able to work. Fourier used the word civilization in a negative sense and as such \"Fourier's contempt for the respectable thinkers and ideologies of his age was so intense that he always used the terms philosopher and civilization in a pejorative sense. In his lexicon civilization was a depraved order, a synonym for perfidy and constraint ... Fourier's attack on civilization had qualities not to be found in the writing of any other social critic of his time.\"\n\nFor Herbert Marcuse \"The idea of libidinal work relations in a developed industrial society finds little support in the tradition of thought, and where such\nsupport is forthcoming it seems of a dangerous nature. The transformation of labor into pleasure is the central idea in Fourier's giant\nsocialist utopia.\"\n\nHe believed that there were twelve common passions which resulted in 810 types of character, so the ideal phalanx would have exactly 1620 people. One day there would be six million of these, loosely ruled by a world \"omniarch\", or (later) a World Congress of Phalanxes. He had a concern for the sexually rejected; jilted suitors would be led away by a corps of \"fairies\" who would soon cure them of their lovesickness, and visitors could consult the card-index of \"personality types\" for suitable partners for casual sex. He also defended homosexuality as a personal preference for some people. Anarchist Hakim Bey describes Fourier's ideas as follows: \"In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion—this is the famous theory of \"attractive labor.\" Fourier sexualizes work itself—the life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, & activity, a society of lovers & wild enthusiasts.\"\n\nFourier was also a supporter of women's rights in a time period when influences like Jean-Jacques Rousseau were prevalent. Fourier believed that all important jobs should be open to women on the basis of skill and aptitude rather than closed on account of gender. He spoke of women as individuals, not as half the human couple. Fourier saw that \"traditional\" marriage could potentially hurt woman's rights as human beings and thus never married. Writing before the advent of the term 'homosexuality', Fourier held that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and \"androgénité\". He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.\n\nFourier's concern was to liberate every human individual, man, woman, and child, in two senses: education and the liberation of human passion.\n\nOn education, Fourier felt that \"civilized\" parents and teachers saw children as little idlers. Fourier felt that this way of thinking was wrong. He felt that children as early as age two and three were very industrious. He listed the dominant tastes in all children to include, but not limited to:\n\n\nFourier was deeply disturbed by the disorder of his time and wanted to stabilize the course of events which surrounded him. Fourier saw his fellow human beings living in a world full of strife, chaos, and disorder.\n\nFourier is best remembered for his writings on a new world order based on unity of action and harmonious collaboration. He is also known for certain Utopian pronouncements, such as that the seas would lose their salinity and turn to lemonade, and a coincidental view of climate change, that the North Pole would be milder than the Mediterranean in a future phase of Perfect Harmony. \n\nThe influence of Fourier's ideas in French politics was carried forward into the 1848 Revolution and the Paris Commune by followers such as Victor Considerant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He eventually rose to the rank of colonel in Nathaniel Heard's New Jersey militia brigade. From 1776 to 1779 he served in the New Jersey Line of the Continental Army, seeing action at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth.\n\nBrearley resigned from the army in 1779 to serve as the New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice, succeeding Robert Morris. He decided on the famous \"Holmes v. Walton\" case where he ruled that the judiciary had the authority to declare whether laws were unconstitutional or not. He held the seat until 1789.\n\nWhile at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he chaired the Committee on Postponed Parts, which played a substantial role in shaping the final document. The committee addressed questions related to the taxes, war making, patents and copyrights, relations with Indian tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the house. The biggest issue they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input. They adopted the earlier plan for choosing the president by electoral college, and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be \"nineteen times out of twenty\". The committee also shorted the president's term from seven years to four years, freed him to seek reelection, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created the vice president, whose only role was to succeed the president and preside over the senate. This also transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, who was given the power (which had been given to the senate by Rutledge's committee) to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. After signing the Constitution in 1787, he headed up the New Jersey committee that approved the Constitution. In 1789, he was a Presidential elector and on September 25, 1789, he was nominated by President George Washington to be the first federal district judge for the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, a newly created seat. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 25, 1789, and received his commission the following day. He died in that office a few months later.\n\nBrearley was the first Grand Master of the New Jersey Masonic Lodge.\n\nHe is buried in the churchyard of Saint Michael's Episcopal Church in Trenton, New Jersey, and a cenotaph was placed there in 1924.\n\nDavid Brearley High School in Kenilworth, New Jersey, was named in his honor.\n\nBrearley Street in Madison, Wisconsin is named in his honor.\n\nBrearley Crescent in Waldwick, NJ is named in his honor.\n\nBrearley Lodge No.2 Masonic Lodge in Bridgeton,NJ is also named in his honor\n\n"}

On April 29, 2011, he was detained during a protest. On May 25, 2011, his body was delivered to his family, having been badly bruised, along with burn marks, three gunshot wounds, and \nsevered genitals. Hamza's family distributed photos and video of his body to journalists and activists. Shocked by what was depicted, thousands of people showed their support for Hamza online and in street protests.\n\nHamza lived with his parents in the village of al-Jeezah in Daraa Governorate. He enjoyed watching his homing pigeons fly above his house since drought had left him unable to enjoy swimming. He had a reputation for being generous. \"He would often ask his parents for money to give to the poor. I remember once he wanted to give someone 100 Syrian Pounds ($2), and his family said it was too much. But Hamza said, 'I have a bed and food while that guy has nothing.' And so he persuaded his parents to give the poor man the 100,\" his cousin told Al Jazeera.\n\nAl-Jazeera reported that he was not interested in politics, according to an unnamed cousin, but on April 29, 2011, he joined his family in a rally to break the siege of the city of Daraa. \"Everybody seemed to be going to the protest, so he went along as well,\" said his cousin. Hamza walked with friends and family 12 km along the road from al-Jeezah north-west to Saida. Firing began almost as the protesters reached Saida. Hamza's cousin reported: \"People were killed and wounded, some were arrested. It was chaotic we didn't know at that point what had happened to Hamza. He just disappeared.\" One source says that Hamza had been among 51 protesters detained by Air Force Intelligence, which detainees allegedly described as having a reputation for brutal torture.\n\nA video of his body filmed several days after his death showed numerous injuries, including broken bones, gunshot wounds, burn marks, and mutilated genitals. \"The Globe and Mail\" summarized: \"His jaw and both kneecaps had been smashed. His flesh was covered with cigarette burns. His penis had been cut off. Other injuries appeared to be consistent with the use of electroshock devices and being whipped with a cable.\"\n\nFollowing the broadcast, by Al Jazeera, of a video showing Hamza's body there was widespread outrage, both online and amongst the protesters in Syria.\n\nIn response to Al Jazeera's story, the chief of Syria's medical examiners association, Dr. Akram El-Shaar, denied that Hamza was tortured. El-Shaar said that he supervised the autopsy in Damascus and that the boy did not have any sign of torture. He also claimed that Hamza had been shot in the Daraa riot and that all signs of disfigurement were due to decay.\n\nHamza's name became a rallying cry for protesters. A Facebook page honouring him had more than 105,000 followers by May 2011. Following the pattern of demonstrators calling Fridays a \"day of rage\", Saturdays in Syria were called the \"day of Hamza\".\n\nOn May 31, 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton marked his death as a turning point in the Syrian uprising, indicating that it \"symbolises for many Syrians ... the total collapse of any effort by the Syrian government to work with and listen to their own people\".\n\nOn March 14, 2012 \"The Guardian\" released 3,000 emails leaked from Asma al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's wife, and her father, Fawas Akhras. Akhras had emailed Bashar al-Assad, instructing him to respond to allegations that children are tortured in Syria by dismissing it as \"British propaganda\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "866358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=866358", "title": "Edmund Scientific Corporation", "text": "Edmund Scientific Corporation\n\nEdmund Scientific Corporation was a company based in Barrington, New Jersey that specialized in supplying surplus optics and other items via its mail order catalog and Factory Store.\n\nIn 1942, amateur photographer Norman W. Edmund (1916 - 2012) found it hard to find lenses he needed for his hobby. This led him to advertise lenses for sale in photography magazines. It was so successful he founded \"'Edmund Salvage Corporation'\". It soon changed its name to Edmund Scientific and made its name with ads in publications like \"Scientific American\" as a supplier of chipped lenses, war-surplus optics, and low cost scientific gadgetry. Its advertisements caught the attention of hobbyists, amateur astronomers, high school students, and cash-strapped researchers.\n\nEdmund Scientific was part of the post-World War II \"war surplus\" phenomenon, when the U.S. government sold off large quantities of materials. \"Army and Navy Stores\" were a national phenomenon and originally sold military-surplus clothing. Surplus electronics found an outlet in dozens of shops, in New York City's \"Radio Row\" and elsewhere. A few issued catalogs and developed national mail-order businesses. Edmund was, however, the only widely known supplier of surplus optics.\n\nThe core of Edmund's offerings was surplus lenses. These were single-element lenses, shipped in coin envelopes, with the \"approximate\" diameter and focal length stenciled on them. Reflecting their salvage and surplus origins, available diameters and focal lengths did not fall into regular progressions. Edmund published crudely printed, stapled \"books\" describing experiments that could be performed with their lenses, and plans for building telescopes and other optical equipment. Edmund also sold lens \"kits\". The 10-lens kit cost less than US$10 and included a booklet of plans for instruments which could supposedly be built with them.\n\nUnlike Heathkits, which were absolutely complete kits requiring only soldering and assembly, Edmund's \"kits\" consisted of only the lenses. A great deal of skill and effort would have been needed to fashion the telescopes, microscopes, or opaque projectors described. With single-element lenses, the quality of the resulting optics was not high. Edmund even sold high-quality, thick, black cardboard tubes needed for many of the projects.\n\nFollowing Sputnik, Edmund was able to capitalize on a growing national interest in science and astronomy. They expanded their business into a full line of telescopes and telescope kits as well as equipment, parts, and supplies for other scientific fields such as physics, optics, chemistry, microscopy, electronics, and meteorology. They continued to grow as a supplier to teachers and schools with demonstration devices and kits which covered most fields of science.\n\nEdmund's catalog became a source for optical and mechanical parts essential to amateur telescope making, including hard-to-find items such as optical glass blanks, pitch-lap ingredients, and a series of grit abrasives for grinding and polishing astronomical objective mirrors by hand. A compilation of Edmund's earlier pamphlets published as the book \"All About Telescopes\" offered many designs for telescopes of all sizes and configurations, which directed the builder to the relative Edmund catalog part numbers needed for each design. The \"Factory Store\" in Barrington, New Jersey also had a number of bins and shelves full of rare surplus items which never made it into the catalogs.\n\nEdmund's catered to the 1960s generation by expanding and highlighting their line of projectors, color wheels, black lights, filters and other optical devices which could be used by rock bands and in psychedelic light shows. Other items catering to the counterculture were eventually added to the catalog covering the fields of Biofeedback, ESP, Kirlian photography, Pyramid power, and alternative energy.\n\nIn 1971, in the Whole Earth Catalog of items \"relevant to independent education\", Stewart Brand noted: \"Edmund is the best source we know of for low-cost scientific gadgetry (including math and optics gear). [In this category,] many of the items we found independently... turned up in the Edmund catalog, so we were obliged to recommend that in this area we've been precluded.\"\n\nSome sources claim that certain of the original polyhedral dice used in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game system were obtained from Edmund Scientific.\n\nIn the 1970s, as the viability of Edmund's business model waned, Norman Edmund's son Robert Edmund refashioned the business into two new ones, Edmund Scientifics and Edmund Optics. Edmund Scientifics marketed to consumers and specialized in science-themed toys, vaguely high-tech household gadgets, and \"science gifts.\" Edmund Optics did not have a public showroom like Edmund Scientifics, although the two organizations shared the same building. The large back room of Edmund Scientifics still sold military surplus from World War II and other wars well into the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. Some of the items in the surplus room were from German and other non-American militaries. None of these items were in the mail-order catalogs. They also sold other surplus wares of interest to hobbyists, including specialized motors and other miscellaneous electronics, parts from toys, and other household items.\n\nIn line with their focus on optics, Edmund Scientifics's entrance vestibule housed a pale-blue working World War II Japanese submarine periscope. Children were often drawn to this periscope. Drawing on the periscope's popularity, sometime in the 1970s a hall of mirrors, complete with black lights, was installed toward the rear of the building.\n\nThe Barrington, New Jersey, store closed in 2001 after Edmund Scientific was acquired by Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories.\n\nBeginning in 2000, Edmund Optics offered a variety of experimental grade and stock clearance items via a print catalog and online under a separate business named Anchor Optics, but this operation ceased in 2016, and the current Anchor Optics website now redirects to a page at Edmund Optics listing clearance items.\n\nAs of 2017, Edmund Optics continues to offer brand-new stock optics, as well as offering custom and specialized optics to corporations and higher education institutions.\n\nIn 2000 Edmund Scientific was purchased by Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories, a western New York based science supply company. Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories is part of a group of companies that provide science supplies to elementary, middle, and high schools as well as colleges and universities. This group falls under the unofficial umbrella \"VWR Education\" and are owned by VWR International, a multi-national conglomerate with offices in India, China, Europe, Canada and the United States. They are no longer affiliated with Edmund Optics Inc.\n\nAs of 2009, online sales now make up the bulk of Edmund Scientific's revenues. The company still sells telescopes (including an updated version of their Astroscan Telescope), microscopes (mostly they carry the Boreal brand which is manufactured for their parent company Science Kit LLC), surplus optics, magnets and Fresnel lenses. They continue to sell many of their old favorites along with new items such as the Impossiball and hand boilers as well as other science-themed toys, novelty items, gifts and gadgets.\n\nEdmund Scientific has provided items used in television shows such as \"House\", \"MythBusters\", \"24\", \"Modern Marvels\", and motion pictures such as \"Star Trek\", and the 1975 version of \"Escape to Witch Mountain\". Wah Chang, the artist who designed and built several props in the 1960s for the television show, used moiré patterns found in the Edmund Scientific Educator's and Designer's Moiré Kit for the texture used in the Starfleet communicator props.\n\nIn the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Two Bad Neighbors\", Bart Simpson releases locusts from a box labeled \"Edmund Scientific\".\n\n\n"}

He is credited with the 1953 discovery of Gee's golden langur. He is notable as an early influential wildlife conservationist, especially for his 1959 and 1963 surveys and recommendations resulting in the creation of Chitwan National Park, the first of nine national parks in Nepal.\n\nGee was the fourth son of Rev. C. G. Gee, Vicar of Lowick and his wife, daughter of a Colonel Briggs of Hylton Castle. As a tea planter, Gee was part of a highly influential group of British landowners very close to the highest levels of provincial power.\nSoon after India's Independence, Gee was one of the first to assess the threats to endangered species and outline conservation measures to protect them. He believed cattle had no place in a sanctuary and thought they would arouse a sense of surprise, disappointment, and revulsion in tourists who had come looking for wild animals.\n\nLike his contemporaries, Salim Ali and M. Krishnan, Gee was a non-official member of the Indian Board for Wildlife, the apex body that advises the Union Government on wildlife matters. Gee argued in favour of separate wildlife wardens within the Forest Department, who have specific powers in relation to fauna. He wrote extensively on the role of foresters as protectors of wildlife, as he thought it important to rely on their goodwill. He believed conservation success depended on cooperation between foresters and the forest ministers of each state and that the role of the central government was only to advise and assist.\n\nHe is famous for his discovery of the langur species which is named after him, Gee's golden langur. He had heard reports of an unusual coloured primate and he organised an expedition in 1953. He managed to film the langurs near the Sankosh River on the border between Assam and Bhutan. \nHe recommended that the Govindgarh Palace of the Maharaja of Rewa, and its white tiger inhabitants, be made a \"National Trust\", which didn't happen.\n\nIn 1959, the Fauna Preservation Society appointed E.P. Gee to undertake a survey of the Chitwan Valley. Gee, who had spent most of his life in India and was an authority on its wildlife, recommended creation of a national park north of the Rapti River. He also proposed creation of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of ten years. In 1963, after he surveyed Chitwan again, this time for both the Fauna Preservation Society and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Gee recommended extension of the national park to rhinoceros areas to the south of the river. In December 1970, His Majesty King Mahendra approved extension of the national park as recommended, thus creating the first national park in Nepal.\n\nAfter retirement from tea planting in Assam, Gee settled in Shillong, where he assembled one of the finest private orchid collections.\nAfter Independence, sensitive to the nationalism of the new Indian leadership, Gee searched for and emphasized indigenous nature conservation practices, ranging from ancient imperial edicts to village traditions of protecting nesting bird colonies. This cooperative and culturally sensitive style won recognition from Jawaharlal Nehru whom Gee accompanied together with Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and son-in-law Feroze Gandhi on a tour of Kaziranga Wildlife Sanctuary on 20 October 1956. Nehru's forward to Gee's book in February 1964 was one of the only pieces he ever wrote on wildlife conservation. In it he said,\nNehru called for more refuges for vanishing wildlife, but he died in May and Gee died four years later. It was the end of an era.\n\n\n\n"}

Gabbar Singh alias Gabra was born in 1926 in Dang village of Bhind district, a Gujjar by caste. He was written by duo Salim-Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar.\n\nPlayed by Amjad Khan, he is depicted in \"Sholay\" as a dacoit who leads a group in looting and plundering the villages in the region of Ramgarh. He has a sadistic personality and insists on killing whenever required to continue his status and to take revenge on his enemies.The character is considered to be one of the most iconic villains in Indian Cinema. He was featured in the 1991 spoof \"Ramgarh Ke Sholay\", with Amjad Khan portraying a parody version of the character.\n\nThe character Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. The character was also inspired by \"Gunga Jumna\", where Dilip Kumar's character Gunga is a dacoit speaking with a similar dialect, a mix of Khariboli and Awadhi.\n\nDanny Denzongpa was the first choice of Gabbar but had to miss out because he was shooting for Dharmatma in Afghanistan. Amjad Khan was almost dropped from the project because Javed Akhtar found his voice too weak for Gabbar Singh's role but was later convinced. For his preparation for the role Amjad read Abhishapth Chambal, a book on Chambal dacoits written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri (actress Jaya Bhaduri's father). Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but Salim-Javed \"felt he had the audience’s sympathy through roles he’d done before; Gabbar had to be completely hateful.\"\n\nGabbar's language was a mixture of North Indian Khariboli and Hindi, which was something new for the audiences so the dialogues were an instant hit and are still popular in India. Javed Akhtar says that Gabbar seemed to acquire life and vocabulary of his own as he wrote the film. His sadism lies in his choice of words like \"Khurach, khurach (scratch)\" when he talks to Hema Malini.\n\nAmjad shot to stardom with the movie. His mannerisms and dialogues have become an integral part of Bollywood lexicon. \"Sholay\" went on to become a blockbuster, and is the highest grossing movie in India. Although the movie boasted an ensemble cast of superstars including Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan, he stole the thunder with his unorthodox and eerie dialogue delivery that was perfectly opposite to the total lack of empathy his character was supposed to convey. Even after forty seven years people fondly remember his dialogues and mannerisms. He later appeared in advertisements as Gabbar Singh endorsing Britannia Glucose Biscuits (Popularly knowns as \"Gabbar Ki Asli Pasand\"), and it was the first incidence of a villain being used to sell a popular product.\nThe role of Gabbar Singh was so deep-rooted in people's mind those days that Amjad Khan was known for the rest of his life by this role alone and wherever he went he had to speak some dialogues from the film to amuse the public because the dialogues are very popular among the audiences of Indian Cinema.\n\nThe BBC have compared the impact of Gabbar Singh on Bollywood to the impact that Darth Vader later had on Hollywood. According to Anupama Chopra, \"He’s like Darth Vader in \"Star Wars\", pure evil, utterly terrifying and a cool baddie”.\n\nIn 2011, Amitabh Bachchan told a contestant on his \"Kaun Banega Crorepati\" TV show that when Amjad Khan visited their home, his son Abhishek Bachchan ran to him and said \"Papa, Gabbar Singh aaya hai\" (meaning: Father, Gabbar Singh is here!), and Bachchan had to convince his son that Gabbar was just a character played by Khan.\n\nGabbar Singh has been a subject of parodies and jokes innumerable times in the popular Indian media. \"Filmfare\" named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema,\n\nIn \"Jai Hind\" (1994) comedian Senthil says \"Arre O Sambha\" while appearing as a dacoit.\n\nIn 2012 film \"Gabbar Singh\", the character has been referenced by protagonist Venkataratnam Naidu (played by Telugu actor Pawan Kalyan), nicknaming himself after Gabbar Singh's character. Constable Ram Prasad (Ali) is nicknamed 'Samba' after Gabbar Singh's sidekick. The sequel \"Sardaar Gabbar Singh\" (2016 film), Pawan reprises his role, albeit with 'Sardaar' in front of his name, referring to the title given by Gabbar Singh's henchmen. Both Telugu films contain dialogues made famous by Sholay's antagonist, e.g. \"Joh darr gaya... samjho marr gaya\" (Whoever is afraid... they are dead).\n\nIn the 2015 film \"Gabbar is Back\", the protagonist Aditya Singh Rajput (portrayed by Akshay Kumar) resembles Gabbar Singh and he also nicknamed himself after Gabbar's character.\n\n"}

He was one of the main figures of the Brabant Revolution (1789–1790) against the Austrian rule of Joseph II. This revolution led to the short-lived existence of the United States of Belgium with himself as Prime Minister (11 January 1790 – 2 December 1790).\n\nHe was the son of Nicolas van der Noot, Lord of Vreschem, and is distantly related to the current Marquess of Assche.\n\nTwo lawyers, Jan Frans Vonck and Hendrik Van der Noot, were the leaders of the revolt but each represented a different faction. The Vonckists were inspired by the French Revolution (1789–1799) and sought a link-up with the people and the patriot army. The Statists led by Van der Noot strived for the restoration of old privileges of the nobility and the church such as the \"Joyous Entry\" and sought cooperation with the Dutch Republic.\n\nIn contrast to Vonck, who was of the opinion that the Belgian people themselves had to fight against the Austrian despot, Van der Noot had more confidence in obtaining foreign support. In 1788 Van der Noot travelled to England, the Dutch Republic and Prussia to get attention for the cause of Brabant liberty. Only Prussia, which itself had beaten the Dutch patriots in 1787, was inclined to support the Belgian patriots as they were at that time anti-Austrian. Van der Noot had less success seeking support from the last Grand Pensionary of Holland, Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel.\n\nIn October 1789 Van der Noot and General Vander Meersch with a small patriot army from Breda captured the entire province of Brabant. In his first concurred (or freed) town, Hoogstraten, Van der Noot published his Manifesto of the Brabant People on 24 October 1789. The document explains why the people of Brabant have the right to disobedience against a ruler. The main argument is that the will of a nation is the highest law and if that is violated by a ruler the nation has the right to revolt against the ruler.\nVan der Noot captured Turnhout, defeating the Austrians in the Battle of Turnhout on 27 October and Ghent was taken on 13 November. On 17 November the imperial regents Albert of Saxony and Archduchess Maria Christina fled Brussels. The remains of the imperial forces withdrew behind the citadel walls of Luxembourg and Antwerp.\n\nVan der Noot declared Brabant independent, and all other provinces of the Austrian Netherlands with the exception of Luxembourg soon followed suit. On 11 January 1790 they signed a pact, establishing a confederation, headed by Van der Noot, under the name \"Verenigde Nederlandse Staten\"/\"États-Belgiques-Unis\" (United States of Belgium).\n\nWhen Prussia abandoned the revolt after the signing the Convention of Reichenbach (27 July 1790) with Austria the fragile state soon came under attack by the Austrian troops of Leopold II, who had succeeded his brother Joseph II after the latter's death on 20 February 1790. In November 1790 Van der Noot had to flee to the Dutch Republic and thereafter to England. In 1792 he made an appeal for cooperation with the French occupiers (1794–1815). He returned to Brabant but was arrested 1796 and imprisoned in 's Hertogenbosch.\n\nHe died in 1826 in Strombeek and his tomb is located in the wall of the vicar's compound of the Sint-Amandsparochie in Strombeek-Bever.\n\n"}

Marmaduke (born John Sappington Marmaduke, March 14, 1833 – December 28, 1887) served as the 25th governor of Missouri from 1885 until his death in 1887. Prior to that, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded cavalry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. On September 6, 1863 Marmaduke killed Confederate Brigadier-General Lucius M. Walker in a duel. Major-General Sterling Price ordered Marmaduke's arrest, but suspended the order because of the impending Union advance on Little Rock, Arkansas. Marmaduke never faced a court martial for the duel.\n\nThe second son among ten children, John S. Marmaduke was born on his father's plantation in Saline County, Missouri. His father, Meredith M. Marmaduke (1791–1864), was the 8th governor of Missouri. His great-grandfather, John Breathitt, had served as the governor of Kentucky from 1832 to 1834, dying in office. Marmaduke attended Chapel Hill Academy in Lafayette County, Missouri and Masonic College in Lexington, Missouri, before attending Yale University for two years and then Harvard University for another year. U.S. Representative John S. Phelps appointed Marmaduke to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1857, placing 30th out of 38 students. He served as a second lieutenant in the 1st United States Mounted Riflemen, before being transferred to the 2d United States Cavalry under Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston. Marmaduke later served in the Utah War and was posted to Camp Floyd, Utah, in 1858–1860.\n\nMarmaduke was on duty in the New Mexico Territory in the spring of 1861 when he received news that Missouri had seceded from the Union. He hastened home and met with his father, an avid Unionist. Afterwards, Marmaduke decided to resign from the United States Army, effective April 1861. Pro-secession Missouri Governor Claiborne F. Jackson, Marmaduke's uncle, soon appointed him as the colonel of the 1st Regiment of Rifles, a unit from Saline County, Missouri, in the Missouri State Guard. Governor Jackson departed Jefferson City, Missouri in June, along with State Guard commander Major-General Sterling Price, to recruit more troops. Marmaduke and his regiment met them at Boonville, Missouri. Within a short time, Price and Jackson left, leaving Marmaduke in charge of a small force of militiamen. Marmaduke realized his troops were not adequately prepared for combat, but Governor Jackson ordered him to make a stand. Federal Brigadier-General Nathaniel Lyon's 1,700 well-trained and equipped soldiers easily routed Marmaduke's untrained and poorly armed force at the Battle of Boonville on June 17, 1861, a skirmish mockingly dubbed \"the Boonville Races\" by Unionists, since Marmaduke's recruits broke and ran after just 20 minutes of battle.\n\nDisgusted by the situation, Marmaduke resigned his commission in the Missouri State Guard and traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the regular Confederate States Army. The Confederate War Department ordered him to report for duty in Arkansas, where he soon was elected lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Arkansas Battalion. He served on the staff of Lieutenant-General William J. Hardee, a former United States Military Academy instructor of infantry tactics. Marmaduke's former Mormon War commander, Albert Sidney Johnston, asked him to join his staff in early 1862. Marmaduke was wounded in action at the Battle of Shiloh as colonel of the 3rd Confederate Regiment, incapacitating him for several months.\n\nIn November 1862, the War Department confirmed Marmaduke's promotion to brigadier-general. His first battle as a brigade commander was at the Battle of Prairie Grove. In April 1863, Marmaduke departed Arkansas with 5,000 men and ten artillery pieces and entered Union-held Missouri. However, he was repulsed at the Battle of Cape Girardeau and forced to return to Helena, Arkansas. Controversy soon followed. In September 1863, he accused his immediate superior officer, Brigadier-General Lucius M. Walker, of cowardice in action for not being present with his men on the battlefield. Walker, slighted by the insult, challenged Marmaduke to a duel, which resulted in Walker's death on September 6, 1863.\n\nMarmaduke later commanded a cavalry division in the Trans-Mississippi Department, serving in the Red River Campaign. During this period, he once again was involved in controversy. Commanding a mixed force of Confederate troops, including Native-American soldiers of the 1st and 2nd Choctaw Regiments, Marmaduke defeated a Union foraging detachment at the Battle of Poison Spring, Arkansas on April 18, 1864. Marmaduke's men were accused of murdering African-American soldiers of the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry (later designated the 79th U.S. Colored Infantry). Marmaduke and other white officers claimed that the accusations of illegal killings were overblown, and blamed any murders that may have happened on the Choctaw troops who, in the words of one Confederate, did \"kill and scalp some\" of the black troops. He was hailed in the Confederate press for what was publicized as a significant southern victory.\n\nMarmaduke commanded a division in Major-General Sterling Price's Raid September–October 1864 into Missouri, where Marmaduke was captured at the Battle of Mine Creek in Kansas (by Private James Dunlavy of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry). While still a prisoner of war at Johnson's Island in Ohio, Marmaduke was promoted to major-general in March 1865. He was released after the war ended. His younger brother, Henry Hungerford Marmaduke, served in the Confederate States Navy, was captured and was imprisoned on Johnson's Island. He later served the federal government in negotiations with South American nations. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Two other Marmaduke brothers died in the American Civil War.\n\nMarmaduke returned home to Missouri and settled in Carondelet, St. Louis. He worked briefly for an insurance company, whose ethics he found contrary to his own. He then edited an agricultural journal, and publicly accused the railroads of discriminatory pricing against local farmers. The governor soon appointed Marmaduke to the state's first Rail Commission. Marmaduke decided to enter politics, but lost the 1880 Democratic nomination for governor to former Union general Thomas T. Crittenden, who had strong support and financial backing from the railroads. Undeterred, Marmaduke ran again for governor four years later, at a time when public opinion had changed, and railroad reform and regulation became more in vogue. Marmaduke conducted a campaign which apologetically highlighted his Confederate service, emphasized alleged abuses of Missourians by Union troops during the Civil War, celebrated the activities of pro-Confederate \"partisan guerrillas\" such as William Clarke Quantrill, claimed that the Republican Party in Missouri was a tool of \"carpetbaggers\" to oppress \"native\" Missourians, and made overt appeals to white racism. He was elected on a platform officially focused on cooperation between former Unionists and Confederates, promising an agenda which would produce a \"New Missouri.\" He settled potentially crippling railroad strikes in 1885 and 1886. The following year, Marmaduke pushed laws through the state legislature that finally began regulating the state's railway industry. He also dramatically boosted the state's funding of public schools, with nearly a third of the annual budget allocated to education.\n\nMarmaduke never married, and his two nieces served as hostesses at the governor's mansion. Like his great-grandfather, he died while serving as governor. He contracted pneumonia late in 1887 and died in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he was buried in Woodland Cemetery.\n\nMarmaduke, Arkansas, is named after him.\n\n\n"}

Boots states that children of Theobald Mathew settled in Ulster, Northern Ireland, when the family property was passed to a senior branch of the family, and from Ulster immigrated to America during the early years of the Scotch-Irish immigration of 1717–1775. Other historians agree that Mathews was an immigrant from Ireland, though they do not speculate on his ancestry.\n\nJohn Mathews settled in Augusta County, Virginia, near Natural Bridge, in 1742. He held a variety of local offices, and served as a captain of Virginia militia in the French and Indian War. He and wife Ann Archer had eleven children, including George, Sampson, Archer, and William. \n\nGeorge Mathews (1739–1812) was a Virginia Burgess and delegate to the First Virginia Convention. He was a brevet brigadier general in the Continental Army, and afterward a governor of Georgia and a representative to the 1st United States Congress. In 1811 he acted as a secret agent for President James Madison, initiating the Patriot War of East Florida.\n\nSampson Mathews (1737–1806) was a Virginia state senator who led the American defense against Benedict Arnold's 1781 Raid of Richmond. He was a founding trustee of Liberty Hall (now Washington and Lee University).\n\nAdditional members of this family who served in the Virginia legislature in the early years of the Republic include Archer Mathews (1744–1796), Sampson Mathews Jr., son of Sampson Mathews, and John Mathews (1768-1849) and James W. Mathews, sons of William Mathews. \n\nGeorge Mathews, Jr. (1774–1836), son of George Mathews, was a judge of the superior courts of the territories of Mississippi and Orleans, and the first presiding judge of the Louisiana Supreme Court when it was established in 1813. \n\nMason Mathews (1803–1878), grandson of William Mathews, was a Virginia Delegate during the American Civil War. He was the last member of this family to be involved in Virginia politics, as Greenbrier County where he lived was taken into West Virginia on its creation in 1863. He and wife Eliza Reynolds had children including Henry, Alexander F., and Virginia Amanda.\n\nHenry M. Mathews (1834–1884) was an attorney general of West Virginia, and governor of West Virginia during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, the first nationwide labor strike.\n\nAlexander F. Mathews (1838–1906) was aide-de-camp to Confederate General Henry A. Wise, and later a West Virginia University regent.\nGeorge G. Mathews Jr. (1855–1944), great-grandson of George Mathews, was US Consul at Pará, Brazil, for President Grover Cleveland, and later a Florida state representative.\n\nWilliam G. Mathews (1877–1923), son of Henry M. Mathews, was a federal judge and clerk of court for Kanawha, West Virginia.\n\nMason M. Patrick (1863–1942), son of Virginia (Mathews) Patrick, was commander of the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and the Interwar Period. He drafted and proposed the 1926 Air Corps Act to Congress, creating the U.S. Army Air Corps from the existing Air Service. In 1947 the Air Corps was made into the United States Air Force.\n\nThere have been scattered other Mathews who have played a role in the public life of Virginia. These include:\nLt. Col. Samuel Mathews (1630–1660), a commonwealth governor of Virginia, who died while in office (1656-1660), was a member of the first branch of the Mathews family to settle in the New World when his father, Captain Samuel Matthews arrived in Jamestown from England around 1622. Mathews County, Virginia, named for the family and home to their residence Mathews Manor, later known as Denbigh Plantation.\n\nThomas Mathews (1742–1812), a Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, was born in Saint Kitts, an island of the West Indies, and came to the Piedmont region of Virginia in the years before the American Revolution. Both Samuel and Thomas Mathews have been connected to the Mathews of Augusta County by some historians, though the connection has not been noted by others.\n\nRobert Israel Mathews (1836-1888), a Confederate soldier in the American Civil War, was born in Warren County, Virginia in 1836./ Robert Israel Mathews was a farmer until the American Civil War broke out. He enlisted in the 49th Virginia Infantry regiment in the Confederate Army, which was commanded by William Smith. The regiment was nicknamed, \"Extra Billy Smith's Boys\" in 1861. Robert fought in the Battle of First Manassas, Battle of Antietam, Battle of Fredericksburg, Battle of Second Bull Run, Battle of Gettysburg, Battle of Chancellorsville, and the Battle of the Wilderness where he would be shot through the jaw. After the war, Robert told stories to his children and his grandchildren, one of the stories thought to be of the Fairfax Court House in 1861 and John Quincy Marr. After his death in 1888, his grandchildren found a pair of boots he wore and the grandchildren donated them to the Front Royal Civil War Museum in Front Royal, Virginia. He was buried in Browntown, Virginia.\n"}

Her father was killed on November 28, 1868, in the Battle of Washita River when the camp of Chief Black Kettle, of which Little Rock was a member, was attacked by the 7th U.S. Cavalry under the command of Lt. Colonel (brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer. Mo-nah-se-tah was among the 53 Cheyenne women and children taken captive by the 7th Cavalry after the battle.\n\nAllegedly, according to Captain Frederick Benteen, chief of scouts Ben Clark, and Cheyenne oral history, Custer had a sexual relationship with the 18-year-old Mo-nah-se-tah during the winter and early spring of 1868-1869. Mo-nah-se-tah gave birth to a child in January 1869, two months after the Washita battle; Cheyenne oral history alleges that she later bore a second child, fathered by Custer, in late 1869. Custer, however, had apparently become sterile after contracting venereal disease at West Point, leading some historians to believe that the father was really his brother Thomas.\n\nAt daybreak on November 27, 1868, the 7th U.S. Cavalry under the command of Lt. Colonel George Custer attacked a Cheyenne camp of 51 lodges on the Washita River in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Custer's troops were able to take control of the village quickly, but it took longer to quell all remaining resistance. Although some women and children were killed, as Custer acknowledged in his report of the battle, some measures were taken to protect noncombatants, with troops directed to take women and children who had been captured to a designated lodge in the village to be held under guard as the battle continued. One of the scouts, Raphael Romero, was sent to assure those women and children who had remained in their lodges during the attack that they would not be harmed. A total of fifty-three women and children were taken captive.\n\nIn 1938, Joseph White Cow Bull, an Oglala Lakota veteran of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, went with David Humphreys Miller to the Little Bighorn battlefield and recounted to him his recollections of the battle. Among his recollections:\n\nWhile we were together in this village [on the Little Bighorn River], I spent most of my time with the \"Shahiyela\" [Cheyenne] since I knew their tongue and their ways almost as well as my own. In all those years I had never taken a wife, although I had had many women. One woman I wanted was a pretty young \"Shahiyela\" named Monahseetah, or Meotxi as I called her. She was in her middle twenties but had never married any man of her tribe. Some of my \"Shahiyela\" friends said she was from the southern branch of their tribe, just visiting up north, and they said no \"Shahiyela\" could marry her because she had a seven-year-old son born out of wedlock and that tribal law forbade her getting married. They said the boy’s father had been a white soldier chief named Long Hair; he had killed her father, Chief Black Kettle , in a battle in the south [Battle of the Washita] eight winters before, they said, and captured her. He had told her he wanted to make her his second wife, and so he had her. But after a while his first wife, a white woman, found her out and made him let her go.\n\nMiller asked White Cow Bull, \"Was this boy still with her here?\" and White Cow Bull answered:\nYes, I saw him often around the \"Shahiyela\" camp. He was named Yellow Bird and he had light streaks in his hair. He was always with his mother in the daytime, so I would have to wait until night to try to talk to her alone. She knew I wanted to walk with her under a courting blanket and make her my wife. But she would only talk with me through the tepee cover and never came outside.\n\n"}

Hart\n\nNathaniel Gray Smith Hart (c. 1784 – January 23, 1813), often Nathaniel G. S. Hart, was a Lexington, Kentucky lawyer and businessman, who served with the state's volunteer militia during the War of 1812. As Captain of the Lexington Light Infantry from Kentucky, Hart and many of his men were killed in the River Raisin Massacre of January 23, 1813, after being taken prisoner the day before following the Battle of Frenchtown in Michigan Territory.\n\nHart was especially well-connected politically and socially. In addition to reading law with Henry Clay, Hart's wife Anna and Clay's wife Lucretia were sisters. Hart's wife Anna Edward Gist was the stepdaughter of Charles Scott, Governor of Kentucky and through her Hart was also a brother-in-law to James Brown, a future Ambassador to France and to James Pindell - a member of the Society of Cincinnati. Many other members of Hart's Kentucky militia unit and its associated troops also came from the elite of Lexington and of the state. The men's deaths in the two Battles of Frenchtown, but especially in the subsequent Massacre captured state and national attention. The phrase \"Remember the Raisin!\" became an American call to arms for the duration of the War.\n\nNathaniel Hart was one of seven children, the second son of Colonel Thomas Hart, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, and his wife Susanna (Gray) Hart.\n\nOriginally from North Carolina, the family had moved to Hagerstown, Maryland, where Nathaniel was born. In 1794 they settled in Lexington, Kentucky as part of the postwar migration west. His father was a highly successful businessman, achieving wealth. Hart's four sisters married men who achieved some renown: Ann married the future US Senator James Brown (who subsequently served as Minister to France); Eliza married the surgeon Dr. Richard Pindell (a member of the Society of the Cincinnati); Susanna married the lawyer Samuel Price, and Lucretia married Henry Clay, future US Senator and Secretary of State.\n\nHart attended Princeton College, where his classmates included William Elliott from western Ontario. Elliott's father was a Loyalist who had resettled in Canada after the Revolutionary War. The two young men were close enough that Elliot stayed with Hart's parents for a time to recover from a serious illness.\n\nAfter Hart's return to Lexington, he read law under Henry Clay, passed the bar, and set up a law practice in the city. Like his father, he became a successful businessman, a ropewalk (hemp rope factory) in the city being among his ventures. Hemp was a commodity crop of central Kentucky. In April 1809, Hart married Anna Edward Gist, the stepdaughter of General Charles Scott, governor of Kentucky, and daughter of Judith Cary Gist Scott and her late husband General Nathaniel Gist. Hart and Anna had two sons, Thomas Hart Jr. and Henry Clay Hart. On January 7, 1812, Hart duelled with Samuel E. Watson at a location on the Indiana side of the Ohio River, near where Silver Creek emptied into the river. This was the site where Henry Clay had duelled with fellow state legislator Humphrey Marshall in 1809.\n\nAt the start of the War of 1812, Hart was commissioned as Captain of the Lexington Light Infantry Company (aka \"The Silk Stocking Boys\") a volunteer unit of the Fayette County, Kentucky militia. He later served as either a Deputy Inspector or as Inspector General of William Henry Harrison's Army of the Northwest. Hart's command was attached to the Fifth Regiment of the Kentucky Volunteer Militia and left for the Northwest in August 1812, where it became part of Army of the Northwest under General James Winchester. In January 1813, a detachment was sent to the defense of Frenchtown, Michigan Territory as part of an effort to retake Detroit from the British. Frenchtown residents had sent word to the Americans asking for relief from an occupying force of the British and their Indian allies.\nDuring the First Battle of Frenchtown on January 18, 1813, the American forces under Lt. Colonel William Lewis were successful in forcing the retreat of the small British force stationed there. The British commander of the Fort Malden garrison in Amherstburg, Colonel Henry Procter, made plans to take back Frenchtown and he ordered troops to the area.\n\nOn the morning of January 22, 1813, Procter's forces, including hundreds of Indian warriors, attacked the American troops and overwhelmed the right flank of regulars under Winchester, forcing him and much of the general staff to surrender. The Kentucky militia under the command of Major George Madison on the left flank fought on and thought the flag of truce presented by the enemy was a British flag of surrender. During this second Battle of Frenchtown, 397 Americans were killed. Hart was wounded and was among the 547 survivors who surrendered to Procter upon orders of Winchester. Not many more than 30 Kentucky troops escaped death or capture.\n\nWilliam Elliott, Hart's former Princeton classmate who had become a Captain in the British Army, promised the wounded man safe passage to Fort Malden, but did not carry out his pledge. Elliot borrowed a horse, bridle and saddle from Major Benjamin Franklin Graves, an American officer, promising to send help to the American wounded, but none arrived. Acting American captain William Caldwell wrote the next month that he heard Elliott tell General Winchester and Major Madison that \"the Indians were very excellent surgeons (and ought to kill all the officers and men).\" In one official letter, the eye-witness says that Elliott's broken promise included an offer to take Hart in Elliott's \"own sleigh to Malden that evening\" and that Hart could stay at Elliott's home for his recovery.\n\nUnable to march with the able-bodied prisoners who were being directed to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian to take him to the fort. Along the way they encountered other Indians, who shot and scalped Hart. Hart and an estimated 30–100 unarmed prisoners were killed by Indians on January 23, the day after the battle, in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre.\n\nThe high fatalities of the Americans in the Battle of Frenchtown and the subsequent Massacre of prisoners became fuel for pro-war political factions known as War Hawks, and for anti-British sentiment of the era. The phrase \"Remember the Raisin!\" entered the lexicon of the day as a flashpoint for popular sentiment, becoming a battle cry for American troops, especially the ones on the western frontier. The fact that many of the murdered men were well-known and well-connected members of Kentucky's elite increased the public outcry. Among the dead was Colonel John Allen, Henry Clay's law-partner and co-counsel in Aaron Burr's conspiracy trial at Frankfort. Hart's death is remembered in modern times as \"The Murder of Captain Hart.\" Major Benjamin Franklin Graves of Lexington was another officer apparently killed while a prisoner of the Potawatomi, who were overseeing him and others marching to Detroit. Many American prisoners disappeared or were killed while being force-marched back to British-held territory.\n\nOwing to their high casualties and status as prisoners, surviving Americans were not able to properly bury their fallen comrades. The remains of the American dead at this site were not interred until months later. In 1818, the remains were transferred from Monroe, Michigan to Detroit. Isaac Baker, an American ensign who survived the Massacre and served as an official US Agent for the prisoners, stated in a report to General Winchester that:\n\nIn 1834, the box containing the commingled American remains (including tomahawked skulls), were moved from their former Detroit resting-place and re-interred in Detroit's City Cemetery. These remains are asserted to have received final burial in the State Cemetery of Frankfort, Kentucky. As late as 1849, a mass grave from the battle was excavated during road construction in Monroe, which developed in the area of the battlefield. Some writers state that those skeletons, along with the City Cemetery remains, were returned to Kentucky for final and proper burial that year. A 2004 archeological investigation at the State Monument found no evidence of remains from men of the River Raisin events.\n\nMatthew Harris Jouett, a man who painted noted portraits of Thomas Jefferson, George Rogers Clark and Lafayette, was one of the Kentucky volunteers and among the survivors of the River Raisin Massacre. The company payroll of $6000 disappeared during the slaughter. Jouett restored the missing funds to the militia, based on his earnings as a painter. He also painted portraits of his fellow soldiers from memory, including Hart and Colonel Allen.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They perform in the tercio de varas which is the first of the three stages in a Spanish bullfight.\n\nThe picador has three main functions:\n\nIf the public feels that a picador is better than the bull the public will whistle, boo or jeer as they see fit. This is because they do not want the bull to lose all its strength and energy as this can lead to a dull bullfight.\n\nThe picador is obliged to give the bull two lances in a first category bullring (Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Zaragoza etc.), but the matador may request that the second be waived in second and third category rings. The bull may receive three lances if it is particularly ferocious.\n\nThe aim of the bull to charge the picador is often cited as the biggest test of its courage. A bull that does not charge may be punished with a black \"banderilla\", which although somewhat longer than a normal \"banderilla\" is largely symbolic and a mark of shame for the breeder. This is very rare.\n\nPrior to 1928, horses did not wear protection and the bull would on occasion disembowel the horse during this stage. In Seville they retain two teams of \"muleteros\", one to drag out the dead bull and the other to drag out any dead horses (this is now just for tradition). These days the horse is surrounded by a \"peto\", a mattress-like protection that greatly minimizes damage taken. However, injuries to the horses often include broken ribs and damage to internal organs.\n\nIn the original days before bullfighting became recognizable in today's form, the picador was the central attraction and his name would be billed on the promotional flyers. In these bullfights the bull would charge the horse and the spectacle was watching the rider's skill in protecting his horse whilst lancing the bull. The picador would lance the bull as many times as necessary. The matador and other bullfighters were on hand to help the picador, to direct the bull to the picador, and finally to finish off the injured bull. It was not until certain foot bullfighters started to bring some flair to their minor roles, to the pleasure of the crowd, that matadors started to become the main attraction, ultimately relegating the picador to a relatively unpopular and minor function.\n\n"}
{"id": "2244363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2244363", "title": "Robert Ryman", "text": "Robert Ryman\n\nRobert Ryman (born May 30, 1930) is an American painter identified with the movements of monochrome painting, minimalism, and conceptual art. He is best known for abstract, white-on-white paintings. He lives and works in New York.\n\nRyman was born in Nashville, Tennessee. After studying at the Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, Cookeville, between 1948 and 1949, and at the George Peabody College for Teachers between 1949 and 1950, Ryman enlisted in the United States army reserve corps and was assigned to an army reserve band during the Korean War. Ryman moved to New York City in 1953, intending to become a professional jazz saxophonist. He had lessons with pianist Lennie Tristano, which later informed his painting. Ryman soon took a day job at the Museum of Modern Art as a security guard to make ends meet, and met the artists Sol LeWitt and Dan Flavin, who were co-workers with him at MoMA. Immediately after quitting his job at MoMA, Ryman spent the next year working in the art division of the New York Public Library. He also met artist Roy Lichtenstein during this period of the 1950s.\n\nCaptivated by the newly acquired abstract expressionist works of Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, Clyfford Still, Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman, Ryman became curious about the act of painting. From 1953 to 1960, he worked at the MoMA as a guard in order to be close to painting. He purchased some art supplies at local store and began experimenting in his apartment in 1955. That year, Ryman finished what he considers his earliest professional work, a largely monochrome painting titled \"Untitled (Orange Painting)\" (1955–59).\n\nRyman had a close relationship with the late conservator Orrin Riley, who would frequently give him advice on archival materials, many times testing the acidity of media the artist was interested in using. He has been interviewed by the television writer and producer Barbaralee Diamonstein twice, once for the book and video production \"Inside New York's Art World\" in 1979 and again for \"Inside the Art World\" in 1993.\n\nIn 1961 the artist married art historian Lucy Lippard. They had a son together, Ethan Ryman, in 1964, who was a sound engineer and recently began making art. This marriage ended in divorce. He later married artist Merrill Wagner. Robert Ryman's sons, Cordy Ryman and Will Ryman are also artists and currently work in New York City.\n\nRyman is often classified as a minimalist, but he prefers to be known as a \"realist\" because he is not interested in creating illusions, but only in presenting the materials he has used in compositions at their face value. As he wrote in a statement for a 2010 exhibition at Pace Wildenstein, \"I am not a picture painter. I work with real light and space, and since real light is an important aspect of the paintings, it always presents some problems.\" The majority of his works feature abstract expressionist-influenced brushwork in white or off-white paint on square canvas or metal surfaces. A lifelong experimenter with media, Ryman has painted and/or drawn on canvas, linen, steel, aluminum, plexiglas, lumasite, vinyl, fiberglass, corrugated paper, burlap, newsprint, wallpaper, jute sacking, fiberplate, a composite material called gator board, feather board, handmade paper, and acrilivin. He has used painted and/or drawn with oil, acrylic, encaustic, Lascaux acrylic, casein, enamel, pastel, oil pastel, graphite, guache, and enamelac. Ryman has also experimented with printmaking, creating etchings, aquatints, lithographs, and silkscreens. His most famous quote is \"There is never any question of \"what\" to paint only \"how\" to paint.\"\n\nBy the time Ryman began working, older artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and Philip Guston had already reduced painting to its essences. In 1955 Ryman began what he considers his earliest professional work, a largely monochrome painting titled \"Orange Painting\" (1955–59). In the late 1960s he created his \"Classico\" series of compositions consisting of multi-panel paintings on a specific type of paper called Classico. For each work in the series, Ryman attached a configuration of heavy, creamy white sheets of the paper to a wall with masking tape, painted the sheets with a shiny white acrylic paint, removed the tape when the sheets were dry, mounted them on foamcore, and reattached them to the wall. The built-up paint edge tracing the outline of masking tape and the ripped paper left behind give witness to the process of creation. The various works in the Classico series differ in the organization of paper sheets, the configuration of tape traces, and the painted shape. Just as the \"Classico\" works were titled after the type of paper used as a medium, the so-called \"Surface Veil\" works from 1970 were named for the brand of fiberglass upon which the smaller pieces in this group were painted. Some of the 12-foot square paintings from the series were executed not on fiber-glass but on cotton or linen. In each of these works the pigment appears to form a membrane over the support due to the differing degrees of opacity and translucence in the white paint juxtaposed with areas where less of it has been applied, leaving the fabric exposed. These disruptions in the painting’s skin often mark the literal pauses between the artist’s working sessions.\n\nFrom 1975 until the late 1990s, Ryman affixed his paintings to the wall with metal brackets. He would design each set of brackets specifically for each piece and have them constructed by a local metals fabricator.\n\nIn 2009 he participated in the art project \"Find Me\", by Gema Alava, in company of artists Lawrence Weiner, Merrill Wagner and Paul Kos.\n\nHe has stated that his paintings' titles are meaningless, and that they only exist as a form of identification. Ryman actually prefers the term of \"name\" for a painting instead of a title because he is not creating a picture or making reference to anything except the paint and the materials. The \"names\" of paintings often come from the names of art supplies, companies, or are just general words that do not carry much connotation.\n\nRyman had his first one-man show at Paul Bianchini's gallery, New York, in 1967 at the age of 36; his first show in Europe came the following year at the Galerie Heiner Friedrich, Munich. One year later, Ryman was included in \"When Attitudes Become Form\", a seminal exhibition of works by Minimalist and Conceptual artists organized by the Kunsthalle Bern. His first one-man show at a museum was in 1972 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, displaying thirty-eight of Ryman’s works from 1965 to 1972. Ryman's works were represented in documentas 5 (1972), 6 (1977), and 7 (1982), in Kassel, in the Venice Biennale (1976, 1978, 1980), and in the Whitney Biennial (1977, 1987, 1995). His first retrospective was organized by the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, in 1974. In 1992, a major touring retrospective of Ryman's paintings was mounted by the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Gallery, including venues such as the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.\n\nRobert Ryman is represented by Pace Gallery in New York, and Xavier Hufkens in Brussels.\n\nThe Hallen für Neue Kunst, a former contemporary art museum in Schaffhausen, Switzerland (closed in 2014) had the largest public collection of Ryman's work, permanently exhibiting 29 pieces created from 1959 to 2007. In 2010 Ryman undertook a major reinstallation of his galleries at Hallen für Neue Kunst. Returning to the museum in 2008 — for the first time in 12 years — to revisit the permanent exhibition of his work that was first installed in 1983, he decided to transform the galleries into a “gesamtkunstwerk” — a synthesis, or total experience, composed of 30 paintings from 50 years of work. \n\nIn 2017, Ryman donated 21 painting to the Dia Art Foundation’s permanent collection, making it the only site with an extensive permanent grouping, featuring works made as early as the late 1950s and continuing up to 2003. Other major museums collecting his works include the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Tate, London; the Art Institute of Chicago and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.\n\nA recipient of numerous honors, Ryman has been awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Scholarship (1973), the Skowhegan Medal from the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (1985). He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters since 1994, and assumed the role of the organization’s Vice President in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, Ryman was awarded the Praemium Imperiale.\n\n2009 saw the publication of \"Robert Ryman: Critical Texts Since 1967\", edited by Vittorio Colaizzi and Karsten Schubert and published by Ridinghouse. The book charts the gradual evolution of the reception of and reaction to Ryman’s art. A comprehensive selection of over 60 essays and exhibition reviews has been collated into one volume, including texts by some of the most influential art historians and critics: Yve-Alain Bois, Donald B. Kuspit, Lucy R. Lippard and others.\n\nRyman's painting \"Bridge\" (1980) sold for $20.6 million at a Christie's auction in 2015.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Marlborough College, Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and Brasenose College, Oxford from which he received a first class bachelor's degree in 1969, and of which he was made an Honorary Fellow in 1999. In 1962, he was selected to attend Camp Rising Sun in upstate New York.\n\nJanvrin entered the Royal Navy in 1964, was commissioned as an acting sub-lieutenant on 1 September 1966, promoted lieutenant on 4 March 1971, and served until 2 July 1975. He subsequently became a member of the Castaways' Club. On leaving the Navy, Janvrin joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He was a Second Secretary in 1975 and was appointed First Secretary at the mission to NATO in 1976. He was officially appointed an Officer of the Diplomatic Service on 7 February 1979. Janvrin was First Secretary in New Delhi from 1981 to 1984, during which time he was made a Member of the 4th Class of the Royal Victorian Order for services during the state visit by The Queen to India.\n\nJanvrin was then Counsellor and Deputy Head of Department for the Personnel Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1985 to 1987.\n\nOn 1 June 1987 he was recruited as Press Secretary to The Queen, though it was initially thought that he would be appointed Assistant Press Secretary. On 19 October 1990 he became Assistant Private Secretary to The Queen, and in 1996 the Deputy Private Secretary. He was promoted to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1994 New Year Honours, and Knight Commander (KCVO) in the 1998 New Year Honours, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1997 New Year Honours. In February 1999 he succeeded Sir Robert Fellowes (later Lord Fellowes) as Private Secretary to the Queen. He was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 2003 New Year Honours.\n\nJanvrin was also a Trustee of the Queen's 80th Birthday Trust and is the chairman of trustees of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.\n\nIn December 2006, it was announced that he would retire in September 2007, to be replaced by Christopher Geidt.

{"id": "635610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=635610", "title": "The Dubliners", "text": "The Dubliners\n\nThe Dubliners were an Irish folk band founded in Dublin in 1962 as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group after its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves The Dubliners. The line-up saw many changes over their fifty-year career, but the group's success was centred on lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew. The band garnered international success with their lively Irish folk songs, traditional street ballads and instrumentals. The band were regulars on the folk scenes in both Dublin and London in the early 1960s, and were signed to the Major Minor label in 1965 after backing from Dominic Behan. They went on to receive extensive airplay on Radio Caroline, and eventually appeared on \"Top of the Pops\" in 1967 with hits \"Seven Drunken Nights\" (which sold over 250,000 copies in the UK) and \"The Black Velvet Band\". Often performing political songs considered controversial at the time, they drew criticism from some folk purists and Ireland’s national broadcaster RTÉ had placed an unofficial ban on their music from 1967 to 1971. During this time the band's popularity began to spread across mainland Europe and they appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in the United States. The group's success remained steady right through the 1970s and a number of collaborations with The Pogues in 1987 saw them enter the UK Singles Chart on another two occasions.\n\nThe Dubliners were instrumental in popularising Irish folk music in Europe, though they did not quite attain the popularity of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem in the United States. They influenced many generations of Irish bands, and their legacy can to this day be heard in the music of artists such as The Pogues, Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly. Much adored in their native country, covers of Irish ballads by Ronnie Drew and Luke Kelly tend to be regarded as definitive versions. One of the most influential Irish acts of the 20th century, they celebrated 50 years together in 2012, making them Ireland's longest surviving musical act. Also in 2012, the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards bestowed them with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The Dubliners announced their retirement in the autumn of 2012, after 50 years of playing, following the death of the last of the founding members, Barney McKenna. However, the surviving members of the group, with the exception of John Sheahan, continued touring under the name of \"The Dublin Legends\". As of 2018, Seán Cannon is the only former member still in this group, following Eamonn Campbell's death in October 2017.\n\nThe Dubliners, initially known as \"The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group\", formed in 1962 and made a name for themselves playing regularly in O'Donoghue's Pub in Dublin. The change of name came about because of Ronnie Drew's unhappiness with it, together with the fact that Luke Kelly was reading \"Dubliners\" by James Joyce at the time. Founding members were Drew, Kelly, Ciarán Bourke and Barney McKenna.\n\nDrew, McKenna and Thomas Whelan had originally teamed up for a fundraising concert and then went on to work in a revue with the Irish comedian John Molloy at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. They used to sing songs between acts.\n\nBefore joining the Dubliners full-time, Kelly had spent some time playing at English folk clubs such as the Jug o'Punch in Birmingham, run by the folk singer Ian Campbell.\n\nThe group played at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963 and that led to them being featured on a BBC programme called Hootenanny. The extra exposure helped them to win a contract with Transatlantic Records, with whom they recorded their first album, called simply \"The Dubliners\". They also recorded their first single featuring \"Rocky Road to Dublin\" and \"The Wild Rover\".\n\nDrew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play Flamenco guitar, and he accompanied his songs on a Spanish guitar. Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995. Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness. Paddy Reilly took Drew's place in 1995. Some of Drew's most significant contributions to the band are the hit single \"Seven Drunken Nights\", his rendition of \"Finnegan's Wake\", and \"McAlpine's Fusiliers\".\n\nLuke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string banjo. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like \"The Black Velvet Band\", \"Whiskey in the Jar\", \"Home Boys Home\"; but also Phil Coulter's \"The Town I Loved So Well\", Ewan MacColl's \"Dirty Old Town\", \"The Wild Rover\", and \"Raglan Road\", written by the famous Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs. While on tour in Germany he collapsed on stage. When Kelly was too ill to play, he was replaced by Seán Cannon. He continued to tour with the band until two months before his death. Kelly died on 30 January 1984. One of the last concerts in which he took part was recorded and released: \"Live in Carré\", recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, released in 1983. In November 2004, the Dublin city council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly. Kelly is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.\n\nCiarán Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar, tin whistle and harmonica. He sang many songs in Irish (\"Peggy Lettermore\", \"Preab san Ól\"). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side. Bourke died in 1988. The band did not officially replace him until his death. \nJohn Sheahan and Bobby Lynch joined the band in 1964. They had been playing during the interval at concerts, and usually stayed on for the second half of the show. When Luke Kelly moved to England in 1964, Lynch was taken on as his temporary replacement. When Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. According to Sheahan, he was never (and still has not been) ever officially asked to join the band. Sheahan is the only member to have had a musical education. Lynch committed suicide in Dublin in 1982.\n\nIn 1996 Ronnie Drew quit the band, and Paddy Reilly came on to replace him. Reilly, a long-time friend of the group, toured with them before on several occasions; he was already a successful solo artist in Ireland, scoring hits with \"The Fields of Athenry\" and \"The Town I Loved So Well\".\n\nIn 2005, Paddy Reilly moved to the United States, and Patsy Watchorn joined the group. Watchorn made a name for himself with The Dublin City Ramblers; like Kelly, he accompanies his songs on the five-string banjo.\n\nThe band toured Europe every year. A planned tour of Denmark two weeks after the death of McKenna on 5 April 2012 went ahead as planned. From the first show in Copenhagen on 18 April onwards he was replaced by the Irish banjo player Gerry O'Connor.\nIn the fall of 2012 the band announced their retirement, effective after their 50th anniversary shows at the end of the year. The Dubliners played their final shows at Vicar Street in Dublin on 28/29/30 December 2012, and made their final TV appearance in the UK on a pre-recorded New Year's Eve edition of Jools Holland Annual Hootenanny' on 31 December. Their last public appearance as the Dubliners was on 27 January 2013 in memory of Barney McKenna.\n\nIn 1987, The Dubliners celebrated their 25th anniversary. They recorded a double CD, produced by Eamonn Campbell, long-time friend and guest musician. He introduced them to The Pogues, and their collaboration resulted in a hit with \"The Irish Rover\". It reached number 8 in the UK singles charts and number 1 in Ireland. In 1990 their final hit single was \"Jack's Heroes/Whiskey in the Jar\", again with The Pogues, which reached number 63 in the UK and number 4 in Ireland. Campbell, who plays the guitar on stage, has been touring with the band ever since. Christy Moore, Paddy Reilly and Jim McCann also featured on the CD; Moore sings a tribute to Luke Kelly, and McCann sings the song \"I Loved the Ground She Walked Upon\", written by Phil Coulter and Ralph McTell. The following year, to coincide with Dublin's millennial celebrations, Radio Telefís Éireann produced an hour-long special on the band and the city's influence on their music, titled \"The Dubliner's Dublin\".\n\nIn 2002, they temporarily reunited with Ronnie Drew and Jim McCann, for their 40th anniversary tour. They made a string of appearances on Irish television throughout this time, including a memorable appearance with Phil Coulter and George Murphy on RTÉ 1.\n\nAfter the tour, Jim McCann was diagnosed with throat cancer and, though he fully recovered, his voice was severely damaged, and he was unable to sing since his illness. Despite this, he regularly acted as MC at folk gigs, notably at The Dubliners reunion shows, and at the 2006 'Legends of Irish Folk' shows (where he also played guitar in the finale).\n\nThe band celebrated their 50th anniversary with an extensive year-long European tour and the release of a live DVD recorded live at Dublin's Vicar Street featuring Chris Kavanagh from the Band \"The Legend of Luke Kelly\" as a special guest. The tour continued in the wake of the death of the final founding member Barney McKenna, although the band announced that the final shows of the tour, to be held 28–30 December also at Vicar Street would be the band's final shows in which the band were joined by former band member Jim McCann.\n\nThe Dubliners became well known, not just in Ireland but also as pioneers for Irish folk in Europe and also (though less successful) in the United States. Their 1967 recordings of \"Seven Drunken Nights\" and \"The Black Velvet Band\" were released on the fledgling Major Minor label, and were heavily promoted on pirate radio station Radio Caroline. The result was that both records reached the top 20 in the UK pop charts. A third single, \"Maids, When You're Young Never Wed an Old Man\" reached number 43 in December 1967. It was their last UK hit single till they recorded with The Pogues in 1987.\n\nIn 1974, Ronnie Drew decided to quit the band, to spend more time with his family. He was replaced with Jim McCann. Before joining the band McCann had a TV show in the early seventies called \"The McCann man\". He is best known for his incarnations of \"Carrickfergus\", Makem's \"Four Green Fields\", and \"Lord of the Dance\". He stayed with the band until 1979 when he left to start a solo career; then Ronnie Drew rejoined the band. First Ronnie went to Norway to record two songs in the Norwegian language with the Norwegian band Bergeners.\n\nThe Dubliners also gained popularity amongst famous musicians such as Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd's drummer Nick Mason, who were all self-proclaimed Dubliners fans.\n\nIn the 1960s, The Dubliners sang rebel songs such as \"The Old Alarm Clock\", \"The Foggy Dew\" and \"Off to Dublin in the Green\". However, the conflict in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards led them to drop most of these from their repertoire. They resumed performing such songs occasionally towards the end of their career. They have also recorded satirical protest songs against nuclear weapons such as \"The Button Pusher\" and \"Protect and Survive\", feminist songs such as \"Don't Get Married\", and socialist songs such as \"Joe Hill\".\n\nOn 8 February 2012, The Dubliners received a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at the 2012 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12893980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12893980", "title": "Zofia Potocka", "text": "Zofia Potocka\n\nZofia Potocka née \"Clavone\" (; 11 January 1760 – 24 November 1822) was a Greek slave courtesan and a Russian agent, later a Polish noble. She was famous in contemporary Europe for her beauty and adventurous life. During the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92), she was the lover of the Russian commander prince Grigory Potemkin and acted as an agent in Russian service. \n\nCompatriots of her time wrote: \"She was beautiful as a dream, a child of southern countries. All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women.\"\n\nPotocka was born in 1760 January 1 (January 11, New Style) in the Turkish city of Bursa to Constantine Clavone, a poor Greek cattle merchant, and Maria Clavone. In 1772, when Zofia was 12 years old, she moved to the Greek district of Phanar in Constantinople with her parents and sisters. \n\nAround 1775, when Zofia was 15 years old, her father Constantine died under mysterious circumstances. Her mother married an Armenian, who also died. During the great fire in Constantinople, their house burned down. In this difficult time for them, her mother Maria sought support from foreign embassies. \n\nIn May 1777, when Zofia was not yet 17 years old, Maria sold her two daughters to the Polish Ambassador, Boskamp Lyasopolskomu. The ambassador was known to procure girls for the Polish king. Learning about their supposed noble origin and seeing the beauty of the girls, the Ambassador agreed to help. The sister were claimed to descent from the noble aristocratic family Pantalisa Mavrokordato, who stemmed from the royal family of Greece and was related by blood to the rulers of Byzantium. \n\nZofia and her sister settled in his palace and was given lessons in French. Reportedly, the ambassador kept her as his mistress for a time, and then prostituted her. Boskamp-Lyasopolsky arranged for her sister to be sold as a wife to a Turkish Pasha, but he promised her mother to arrange marriage for Zofia in Europe. \n\nThe Polish Count Major Józef Witt learned the purpose of the trip and her ancient lineage. He made an offer, bought her from Boskamp-Lyasopolsky and married her in 1779. \nJózef Witt was the son of the commandant of the fortress Kamianetska, and the couple lived a year in Kamianets-Podilskyi, before departing for Europe in 1781.\n\nZofia reportedly made a sensational success when being introduced to the aristocracy by her spouse in the drawing room receptions of Europe in the palaces of Berlin and Hamburg, Vienna, Rome, Venice and, most famously, in Paris. She was celebrated as \"The most beautiful woman in Europe\" and known for her expression: \"My eyes aches\".\nHer beauty and admired ability to improvise herself out of difficult situations resulted in an admiration and love affairs with several of the most powerful personalities of Europe at the time, which attracted a lot of attention. She was regarded as fashionable decoration at every party in high society in the cities they visited and was courted by monarchs and ministers. \nAt the beginning of their European tour, the couple visited Warsaw. In early March 1781, she was called to court to be introduced to King Stanislas Augustus. After Warsaw, they visited Berlin, where Zofia was introduced to the King of Prussia Frederick II. In the resort town of Spa, Zofia was introduced to the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, who was reportedly so fascinated and impressed by her that he ordered Mozart to compose music on the Turkish harem theme. \nIn one of his letters to his sister, the French queen Marie Antoinette, Joseph II recommended the Witte couple to her. \n\nZofia saw Marie Antoinette at Petit Trianon, which at that time was being rebuilt in a landscaped park. This was possibly what Zofia was inspired to create a similar park. Reportedly, Marie Antoinette was charmed by her and spoke of her as her adopted daughter. During her stay in Paris, Zofia became the lover of both of the French king's brothers; the Count of Provence, later King Louis XVIII, and the Comte d'Artois, the future French king Charles X respectively. \n\nOn November 17, 1781 Zofia gave birth in Paris to a son. When this news reached the Polish king, she personally visited Kamianets and congratulated her father-in-law Josef Witt with the birth of a grandson, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General and volunteered to be the godfather of the newborn. \n\nIn 1782, the couple returned to Kamianets visiting Vienna, Moravia, Slovakia and Galicia on the way. In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. \n\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92), she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of Catherine the Great, which lasted until his death. At least during the Siege of Khotyn, her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin. Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of Cherson, and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations. In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress.\n\nIn February 1796, Zofia arrived in Uman and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. In April 17, 1798, in Tulchin, she remarried Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. \n\nDuring her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and Olga (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, Szczęsny Jerzy Potocki, who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw. She also had an affair with the Russian governor, Nikolai Novosiltsov. Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish \"Illuminati\" and died in March 15, 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. \nAs a widow, she was by law only entitled to her dowry and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers. \n\nAs a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother.\n\nIn the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for Berlin to consult German doctors, where she died. \n\nShe left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. \n\nZofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in Talne with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church.\n\nZofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.\n\n"}
