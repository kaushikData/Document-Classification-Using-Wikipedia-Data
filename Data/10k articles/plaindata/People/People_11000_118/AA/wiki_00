He was the son of Akamukai (Many Swans), chief of the Biters band, and following the death of his father in 1871, Aatsista-Mahkan took control of the band. He was known for his generosity and kindness, and for his loyal protection of his family.\n\nIn 1877, he was a signatory to Treaty 7, but he and his people continued to follow the bison until 1881, when he and his people were designated to settle on a reserve, 60 miles east of today's Calgary, Alberta.\n\nRunning Rabbit was born into a prominent family. His older brother Many Swans, who took their father's name, was chief of Biters band of Siksikas to which they belonged. As a teenager and young warrior, Running Rabbit had not performed any great deeds worthy of recognition until his brother lent him an amulet said to have spiritual powers made from a mirror decorated with eagle feathers, ermine skins, and magpie feathers. Running Rabbit was successful during his first ever raid as a warrior, gaining himself two enemy horses which he captured and gifted to Many Swans. Similar success during following expeditions resulted in Many Swans giving Running Rabbit the amulet as a gift. Word of Running Rabbit's success spread throughout the Biters band and many referred to him as the \"young chief\" before he earned or was appointed any leadership position in the band.\n\nDuring the autumn of 1871, chief Many Swans, the chief of the Biters band of the Siksika nation and brother of Running Rabbit, died resulting in Running Rabbit being appointed as chief of the biters. During his career as a band chief he was noted for his kindness, generosity and intelligence.\n\nDue to his intelligence and kindness, Running Rabbit was often looked upon to settle disputes within the band and nation. One incident happened during the early 1870s along the Oldman River where a man from the biters band accidentally killed one of Crowfoot's daughters with a loaded gun. The man hid from Crowfoot who sought to kill him in retaliation in Running Rabbit's teepee. Running Rabbit stressed to Crowfoot that the killing was an accident and gave Crowfoot some horses as added compensation. Though usually peaceful in settling disputes Running Rabbit resorted to violence when the well being of his family was threatened, a noted incident involved Running Rabbit shooting a fellow Indian for beating his blind brother with a whip.\n\nRunning Rabbit signed Treaty No.7 with the Canadian government alongside other Siksika nation chiefs including Crowfoot and Old Sun. The treaty promised the Blackfoot Confederacy reserve lands, hunting rights, trapping rights, and annual provisions/and or payments from the Queen in exchange for all of the traditional territory of the confederacy with the exception of lands set aside for reservations. Running Rabbit was recognized as a minor Siksika chief and was listed as having 90 followers. Running Rabbit and his band continued to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle until the last bison herds within the area were destroyed in 1881, resulting in his band and others of the Siksika nation settling on their previously set aside reserve 60 miles east of Calgary Alberta. On the reservation Running Rabbit was noted for trying to adapt to a new lifestyle which was forced upon them, becoming a noted farmer in 1887.\n\nIn 1892 after the death of head chief No-okska-stumik (Three Bulls), Running Rabbit was appointed as one of the two head chiefs of the Siksika nation alongside fellow chief Old Sun. He remained known for his wisdom, kindness and progressiveness. In 1898 he had made enough money harvesting hay to buy a high top buggy. Running Rabbit died in 1911.\n"}

He earned a mathematics degree in Naples.\n\nBeneduce was a socialist. Nevertheless, he managed to connect with high finance figures and to collaborate with the Italy's fascist regime. He served at different posts, including statistician, teacher, demographer, agricultural and insurance specialist.\n\nHe served as a university professor of statistics and demography until 1919. He contributed to the establishment of the national institution of insurance (INA), which was founded in 1912. He also headed the INA from 1917 to 1919. During World War I, he was asked to established an institution that would help the veterans in finding jobs. As a result, he involved in founding the related body, Opera Nazionale Combettenti (ONC).\n\nHe was appointed head of two state-run credit bodies: Consorzio di Credito per le Opere Pubbliche (Crediop) in 1919 and Istituto di Credito per le Opere di Pubblica Utilita (ICIPU) in 1924.

However, he retained his membership on the boards of various companies until his death.\n\nBeneduce and Luigi Rossi recorded detailed statistics about Italian citizens, who had migrated to the US, but returned to Italy between 1905 and 1906. Beneduce was instrumental in the nationalization of life insurance in Italy. His activities in the finance sector of Italy shaped the industrial development of the country between the 1920s and the 1990s. One of his significant activities in this regard was the reorganization of the bankrupted Italian banking system. In addition, he was the mentor of many eminent financiers and technocrats, who reconstructed Italy after World War II. He also developed Mussolini's deflation policy.\n\nBeneduce had three daughters whose names reflected his socialist orientation: Idea Nuova Socialista, Italia Libera, and Vittoria Proletaria. One of his daughter, Idea, married Enrico Cuccia, a significant financier.\n\nBeneduce died in Rome on 26 April 1944.\n"}

UFO historian Jerome Clark calls him \"one of the most skilled investigators in the history of UFO research.\" He was the main investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in the 1970s.\n\nHendry earned a B.A. in astronomy from the University of Michigan in 1972.\n\nHendry was hired for CUFOS by the organization's founder, J. Allen Hynek, who was seeking a full-time investigator with scientific expertise and an open-minded attitude, and who was neither a debunker nor a \"UFO believer\".\n\nAs the chief investigator for CUFOS during most of the 1970s, Hendry personally investigated over 1000 UFO reports. He was able to find mundane explanations for the vast majority of UFO cases, but he also judged a small percentage of cases to be unexplained. One of the most famous \"unexplained\" cases he investigated was the Val Johnson Incident in 1979, in which a deputy sheriff in Minnesota experienced a \"collision\" with an unknown object which damaged his patrol car and left him temporarily unconscious. Hendry was the primary ufologist to investigate the case; in 1980 he debated the incident with well-known UFO debunker Philip Klass at a symposium held at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nHe was reluctant to speculate as to origins of the unexplained cases, and argued they might be explainable with further data, leading some researchers to label Hendry a \"closet skeptic\". At the same time, a few noted skeptics and debunkers who had praised Hendry's scientific rigor subjected him to strong criticism for his conclusion that a handful of well-documented UFO reports seemed to defy analysis, and might represent genuine anomalies. Hendry suggested that the criticism from both camps were little more than \"ad hominem\" attacks, since they typically paid little or no attention to the substance of his research.\n\nHendry's \"magnum opus\" was \"The UFO Handbook\", a guide for other UFO investigators. In the book, Hendry castigates many mainstream scientists for what he sees as their neglecting UFO studies, but he also had strong criticism for many amateur UFO investigators, who he thought did the subject more harm than good. Clark characterized Hendry's appraisal of ufology in general as \"deeply pessimistic\", concluding that the subject was all but paralyzed by infighting, a lack of cooperation and standardization, and dubious claims. \"The UFO Handbook\" even earned the praise of arch-skeptic Philip J. Klass, who in a review published in \"The Skeptical Inquirer\" described the book as \"one of the most significant and useful books on the subject ever published.\" In an undated PBS interview (sometime after 1994, based on publication dates of a few cited books), Klass again recommends Hendry's book, calling it \"Once [sic] of the best.\"\n\nIn a 1978 presentation at Walsh College, Hendry said \"Maybe I'm the most skeptical of the people at the center. I'm in this thing to get an answer to the UFO question, whatever it is. If it's sociological, fine. If it's extra-terrestial, fine. But I know there's no blanket explanation at this time. I've never seen a UFO and that's probably a good thing, because people might question my motives if I were personally involved.\" His presentation also included information on identifying flying objects.\n\nIn the early 1980s CUFOS experienced some financial difficulties, and as a result the organization could no longer afford a full-time researcher. In addition, Hendry had come to the conclusion that the methodologies used to study UFOs were ultimately frustrating, inconclusive and futile. As a result, Hendry left CUFOS and has largely avoided further involvement in UFO studies.\n\n"}

Film director Bernal wanted to cast theatre and radio actors in \"Himala\", so theatre director Rolando Tinio recommended the casting of Quiambao. She was chosen for the role of Sepa, a disciple of the lead character Elsa, played by famous actress Nora Aunor. Her role in \"Himala\" earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Gawad Urian Awards in 1982. A restored version of \"Himala\" was screened at the 2012 Venice Film Festival to mark its 20th anniversary.\n\nThree decades later, Quiambao was cast as Lusing in the 2012 film, \"Diablo\", which was directed by Mes de Guzman and produced by his wife, Rhea Operaña de Guzman.

In 2012, she won \"Best Actress in the New Breed category\" at the 8th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival. In a later interview, Quiambao described her reaction to winning the honor, \"I was strangely calm,” she recalled. “I didn’t feel cold; I didn’t cry. I was glad that the trophy was presented to me by Iza [Calzado]. I’ve worked with her a number of times on TV and in the movies. I love that girl.\" She also said that she was thrilled to see other veteran Filipino actors win Cinemalaya awards that years, including Anita Linda and Eddie Garcia, which she called \"the night of senior citizens.\"\n\nQuiambao suffered a heart attack on June 28, 2013 while attending the premiere of the one-act play, \"Pamamanhikan\", which she was performing in as part of the \"Virgin Labfest 9\" theatre festival.

{"id": "12864908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12864908", "title": "Chica da Silva", "text": "Chica da Silva\n\nFrancisca da Silva de Oliveira (c. 1732-1796), known in history by the name Chica da Silva whose romanticized version/character is also known by the spelling \"Xica da Silva\" was a Brazilian woman who became famous for becoming rich and powerful despite having been born into slavery. Her life has been a source of inspiration for many works in television, films, music, theater and literature. She is popularly known as \"the slave who became a queen\". The myth of Chica da Silva is often conflated with the historical accounts of Francisca da Silva de Oliveira.\n\nFrancisca da Silva de Oliveira was a parda woman born in Vila do Príncipe (nowadays Serro), in the north of the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil between 1730 and 1735. Not unlike many other regions in Brazil, this region's population was majority afro-descended peoples, with slaves outnumbering whites by a large margin. People in the town made a living either through gold or diamond mining. She lived mainly in Arraial do Tijuco (nowadays known as Diamantina) and was the daughter of a Portuguese man, Antônio Caetano de Sá and an enslaved African woman, Maria da Costa, who was probably from the Gulf of Guinea or Bahia. The region of Minas Gerais was unique in that it had a fairly diverse population in comparison to other slave regions on the Brazilian coast, Caribbean, and the United States.\n\nKnown as \"Francisca parda\" while enslaved, Francisca's first owner was Domingos da Costa, who was from Milho Verde. After Costa, Francisca was sold to Sergeant Manuel Pires Sardinha, with whom she had her first son, Simão Pires Sardinha. Although Sardinha listed Simão as one of his heirs, Sardinha never officially declared paternity of Simão. Francisca's third master was João Fernandes de Oliveira, a diamond mine owner and mining Governor of Arraial do Tijuco, one of the richest persons of Colonial Brazil. Because Francisca later added \"da Silva\" as a surname, it is often incorrectly concluded that she was once owned by a José da Silva de Olivera. The name, however, was very common among the Portuguese at the time and offered a fresh start.\n\nSources suggest that Francisca was granted her freedom, either by José da Silva de Oliveira at the request of João Fernandes or that she was given her freedom directly by João Fernandes when he bought her from Pires Sardinha in 1753. After being granted her freedom, Chica officially changed her name to Francisca da Silva de Oliveira in order to erase her history as a slave. This was hugely beneficial for her son Simão Pires Sardinia who later in life was able hide his mothers slave ancestry and his status of being an illegitimate son in order to receive the prestigious Portuguese title, \"the knight of the Order of Christ.\" \n\nFrancisca and João soon started a relationship. Despite not being officially married, they lived together for several years and had 13 children: Francisca de Paula (1755); João Fernandes (1756); Rita (1757); Joaquim (1759); Antonio Caetano (1761); Ana (1762); Helena (1763); Luiza (1764); Antônia (1765); Maria (1766); Quitéria Rita (1767); Mariana (1769); José Agostinho Fernandes (1770). Soon after, Chica became an independent owner of a house in Tejuco on Opera Street. The house was adorned with many luxuries including an extensive garden, her own personal chapel, and furniture like bathtubs, armoires, mirrors and canopy beds, that were rare to households at the time. Chica was also the owner of many slaves who both helped her in the house and worked in the mines in the region. Chica also presented herself in a very ostentatious manner in order to help differentiate herself from the other mixed people in society. People often showed their status through their material items, which for Chica included her clothing, home, slaves, and change in name. By the end of her life she also included Dona at the beginning of her name for a more prestigious title.\n\nIn 1770, João Fernandes had to return to Portugal and took along with him the 4 sons he had with Chica as well as Chica's two other sons Placid Pires Sardinha and Simão Pires Sardinha, whom were granted noble titles by the Portuguese Court. Their daughters remained with Chica in Brazil and were sent to then renowned Convent of Macaúbas. Even after the departure of João to Portugal, Chica retained her prestige. She was a member of the \"São Francisco do Carmo\" Brotherhood (exclusive to whites), \"Mercês\" Brotherhood (exclusive to mulattaoes) and of \"Rosário\" Brotherhood (exclusive to Africans).\n\nChica da Silva died in 1796. She was buried at the Church of São Francisco de Assis, a privilege that only wealthy whites enjoyed.\n\nIn eighteenth century Brazil, colonizers and slaves were both overwhelmingly male. Portuguese men had traveled to Brazil alone to seek wealth, as Portuguese women were often banned from migrating. In part due to love affairs and children born between Portuguese men and African and/or mulatta slave women, freed former slaves were predominately female. Stereotypes about non-white women were abundant during the colonial period and while gender, race and color worked together to systemically disadvantage negro women, some individuals—such as Chica—used their perceived hyper-sensuality to invert gender and power relations. Once socially mobile, these women were seen as even more dominant than their masters.\n\nChica's legacy was often misused to symbolize Brazil's so called \"racial democracy.\" Currently, however, scholars maintain that she used miscegenation and her connections as a tool to achieve a higher social status, as did other African Brazilians at the time. Historian Júnia Ferreira Furtado sustains that concubinage and marriage between white male and black female in colonial Brazilian society was a way found by the enslaved to change their social position and to escape racism :\n\nJoão Fernandes and Chica da Silva's relationship was a scandal in colonial Brazilian society. Chica da Silva, formerly enslaved, had become one of the most powerful women in colonial America. Chica was banished from the parish church, which was reserved for Caucasians only. To show the locals Chica's power, João Fernandes built a luxurious church attended just by herself. However, as Furtado discloses, Chica attended brotherhoods exclusive to whites, as a way to try to fit into the status quo and be aware of its schemes against her and her people.\n\nContrary to what was propagated, Chica also owned slaves, and is only known to have freed one of them. Historians view this as the main difference between the experience of Africans in Brazil and their counterparts in the United States. While in the US, African-American former slaves had a more unified movement, in Brazil they tried to integrate into white society as mixed-race people saw that \"whitening\" themselves was a way to escape from their slave past. Although slaves didn't have any choice if the master or mistress decided to use them as sex objects, some were able to use the situation, especially in regard to their offsprings who were part European. The colonial Portuguese mentality was also more tolerant than the US Anglo-Saxon one on race when it had to do with their mixed-race offsprings. Whereas Anglo-Saxon slave holders forced their own race-mixed offsprings into slavery and sold them to other masters as well, making a profit from them, Luso-Brazilians generally freed their own mixed-race children and often granted them nobility titles. This happened perhaps because of the lack of Portuguese women that migrated to Brazil.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19412520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19412520", "title": "Early life of Lord Byron", "text": "Early life of Lord Byron\n\nGeorge Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron of Rochdale, better known as the poet Lord Byron, was born 22 January 1788 in Holles Street, London, England, and raised by his mother in Aberdeen, Scotland. His life was complicated by his father, who died deep in debt when he was a child. He was able to work his way through school, and his life advanced after he inherited both his great-uncle's title in 1798 and the Newstead Abbey estate.\n\nByron was the son of Captain John \"Mad Jack\" Byron and his second wife, the former Catherine Gordon, heiress of Gight in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The Byron family had a spotted history, with a history of inconstancy and debt, and the fifth Lord Byron gained reputations of being a whoremaster and a murderer. The poet's father, John Byron, was the first child of Vice-Admiral John \"Foulweather Jack\" Byron, the second son of the fourth Lord Byron. Like the rest of his family, his personal history was one of turmoil; he was one of nine children and was sent to a military school when it became clear that he was unfit for academia. He gambled profusely until his parents refused to pay off his debts, and he soon developed a reputation for womanising and exploiting his companions for money. In 1778, when 22, he ran off to France with the already married Amelia D'Arcy, the heiress of the Earl of Holderness and of Baroness Conyers and the current Marchioness of Carmarthen. He married her in 1779; they had three children, of whom only their daughter Augusta Leigh survived. Conyers died in 1784, and John Byron, in debt and deprived of his wife's £4000 a year income, went to Bath in search of another rich wife. Here he met Catherine Gordon, who was called his \"Golden Dolly\" for her fortune of £23,000; she was a direct descendant of James I of Scotland.\n\nThe Gordon family, like the Byron family, had a history of turmoil and death; her grandfather drowned in 1760, her sister Abercromby died in 1777, her father drowned in Bath Canal in 1779, her other sister Margaret died in 1780, and her mother died in 1782. Her parents, to preserve the family name, had introduced a clause in their will that required the husband of their daughter to take the Gordon name as his own, which John Byron was eager to do. The two married in Bath, 13 May 1785. By July the newly-weds had settled at Gight where John Byron ran through most of the £23,000 Catherine had brought to their marriage. Soon after, he sold her property, the Castle of Gight, for £18,690 to pay off his debts. In March 1786 they went through a second marriage ceremony and John Byron became John Byron Gordon to fulfil the need to sell the estate in Gight. By the end of 1786, Catherine had lost her fortune and her land to John Byron's creditors but she never blamed him for her loss. In July 1787 John fled from the Isle of Wight, where the couple had been living to avoid creditors, to Paris. He was joined there the following September by Mrs Byron who was pregnant. In December she returned to London whilst Byron's father remained on the move to avoid creditors.\n\nMayne states that George Gordon Byron was born 22 January 1788 in a house on 24 Holles Street in London. On the other hand, Robert Charles Dallas in his \"Recollections\" states that Byron was born in Dover. In 1790, John Byron and Gordon moved to Aberdeen, but this was not to last, as John wrote to his sister, \"She is very amiable at a distance; but I defy you and all the Apostles to live with her two months, for if anybody could live with her, it was me\". Byron's parents then decided to live in separate houses upon the same street to see if the distance would allow them to bear each other, which left Byron to be raised by his mother and a nursemaid, Agnes Gray. His parents would meet regularly until they realised that their separation did not solve their problems; John Byron would come to talk to his son, but after being allowed to take Byron to his house to spend one night, he realised that he could not tolerate either Byron or his mother any longer. Shortly thereafter, John left Scotland to live with his sister Fanny (Frances) Leigh at Valenciennes, France, the place where he would die in 1791. After John Byron's death, Gordon claimed that she \"ever sincerely loved\" Byron, and she despaired at her loss.\nCatherine Gordon was taught to read at a young age and had a passion for literature, a passion she shared with her son. Byron would read through the Bible, focusing predominantly on the Old Testament, and he would also read works dealing with history or narrative tales like the \"Arabian Nights\". However this passion for reading was not the only passion mother and child shared; Catherine was also known for having a violent temper. The son inherited his mother's temper but he would not speak while he experienced various fits. On one occasion, the young Byron bit off a piece of a china saucer during his \"silent rage\". Byron's problems were compounded by his mother's lack of money, especially with her having to provide for her delinquent husband. When word reached her that John Byron had died, she cried out loud enough for her neighbourhood to hear. However, her troubles were not over, for in his final moments John Byron had incurred even more debt, which burdened his widow to the point of having to move to another home in worse conditions.\n\nWithout money, she was instead forced to send her son to a day-school at the Long Acre of Aberdeen. Byron did not learn anything at the school, and his mother was forced to hire a series of tutors who taught him literature until he was able to enter the Aberdeen Grammar School in 1798. It was here that Byron became fascinated with politics and began to practice writing narratives. Not everything taught to Byron was met with appreciation; Byron was brought up under Scottish Calvinistic influences including predestination, which encouraged a pessimistic view of life. His mother felt that Byron took in \"the gloomiest Calvinistic tenets\" and believed that she was also \"broken against the rock of Predestination.\"\n\nIn 1796, Byron suffered from scarlet fever, and his mother took him to the Scottish Highlands to stay in the mountains until his recovery. This experience affected Byron greatly, as he described in his poetry, especially his memory of the mountain of Lochnagar and a girl named Mary. He soon fell in love with another Mary, a cousin, and would still think of her until he was 27. On 21 May 1798, the death of Byron's great-uncle, the \"wicked\" Lord Byron, allowed the 10-year-old to become the 6th Baron Byron; he inherited the Rochdale estate in Lancashire, and Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, coming under the care of his relative, Frederick Howard, Earl of Carlisle. Byron noticed no difference in how he was treated until the first time he was given the title \"dominus\" (meaning 'lord') in class; he was struck speechless and burst into tears while the other schoolchildren sat in amazement. However, little money came with the inheritance, as his great-uncle had already squandered most of his fortune; the fifth Lord Byron had sold the Rochdale estate illegally, and more money had to be put into a legal battle to restore Rochdale to Byron.\n\nAlthough Newstead was in not in a state that allowed Byron and his mother to live there, they were able to move nearby Nottingham during August 1798. The residence formed by the ruins of Newstead Abbey adjoined by a large house served as an inspiration of Gothic themes and his belief that there are layers of history that are part of objects in life. During his early moments at Newstead, Byron was attended to by a nurse, May Gray, who developed a reputation for \"perpetually beating him\", which shocked the residents of Nottingham. These beatings occurred as she attempted to educate Byron on religion, after which she abandoned the young boy in the dark. This darkness particularly frightened Byron, as Gray led him to believe that the house was haunted at Gray's prompting. Byron's mother did not find out about these incidents until after Gray was dismissed in 1799.\n\nWhen Byron was born, he suffered from lameness and a twisted foot. After Gray was fired, Byron was put in the care of a \"trussmaker to the General hospital\", a man named Lavender, in hopes that he could be cured; however, Lavender instead abused the boy and would occasionally use him as a servant. After Byron exposed Lavender as a fool, Gordon took her son to visit Doctor Matthew Baillie in London. They took up residence at Sloane Terrace during the summer of 1799, and there Byron started to receive treatment, such as specially designed boots. This medical treatment amounted to £150 a year with 2 guineas per school visit by the physician. Not all of Byron's experiences at Nottingham were for the worse, as Byron was popular among his relatives, such as his great-aunt Frances Byron and her Mrs Parkyns, and among the gentry, middle class, and other important individuals of Nottingham society.\n\nIn August 1799, Byron entered the school of William Glennie, an Aberdonian in Dulwich. Glennie was Byron's first \"serious teacher\", but also one with whom Catherine Gordon would constantly squabble, especially over the control of her son's schedule. Catherine's actions alienated her from both Glennie and Lord Carlisle, with Byron unable to do anything but observe. Regardless of his suffering, Byron was able to perform his \"first dash into poetry\" in 1800; he wrote a love poem in honour of his cousin, Margaret Parker, \"one of the most beautiful of evanescent beings\"., and she would inspire another poem two years later when she died at the age of 15. Byron also refused to let his lameness prevent him from participating in any of the usual physical activities that schoolboys engage in, and on one occasion threw his leg brace into a pond in defiance.\n\nIn 1801, his mother declared \"he must go to a public school\", and Byron was soon after sent to Harrow. His experience at Harrow was dissatisfying to Byron as his lame foot, his lack of money, and his previously neglected education caused to say later that \"I always \"hated\" Harrow till the last year and a half.\" The Headmaster, Dr Joseph Drury, believed that Byron was \"a wild mountain colt\" who had a \"supersensitive vanity\", and as a result placed him under the individual tutorial guidance of his own son Henry Drury, an assistant master, until he could be placed in a class of boys that were his own age. In response to the harsh treatment that he felt that he received at Harrow from the schoolmasters and some of the fellow students, Byron wrote to his mother in 1804: \"I will cut myself a path through the world or perish in the attempt. Others have begun life with nothing and ended Greatly. And shall I who have a competent if not a large fortune, remain idle, No, I will carve myself the passage to Grandeur, but never with Dishonour.\"\n\nWhile at Harrow, Byron became close to John FitzGibbon, second Earl of Clare, and with George John, fifth Earl De la Warr, and Byron retained memories of both. Clare in particular was Byron's favourite, and, after one meeting in which they could spend only five minutes together, Byron afterwards could \"hardly recollect an hour of my existence which could be weighted against them\". Byron had other friends at Harrow, including John Wingfield, Edward Noel Long, (grandson of Edward Long) and George, Duke of Dorset, all of whom appear in Byron's \"Childish Recollections\". Only Long would continue to Cambridge with Byron. These friendships meant a lot to Byron, and when his friends started dying he claimed that \"some curse hangs over me. I never could keep alive even a dog that I liked, or that liked me\". Not all of Byron's relationships encouraged him to stay at the school. Byron's early loves included Mary Duff and Margaret Parker, his distant cousins, and Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at Harrow. Byron refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 due to his love for Chaworth. In Byron's later memoirs, according to Byron's biographer Fiona MacCarthy, \"Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings\". He returned to Harrow in January 1804. By Easter of that year he had begun to correspond with his half-sister, Augusta. His early letters to her illustrate his earnest desire to establish an affectionate friendship with 'a Friend to whom I can confide.'\nHowever, his time at Harrow was not spent just in idleness or with his friends; Byron busied himself by reading books; history was his primary subject, followed by biography, poetry, philosophy, and other topics. He was originally supposed to be an orator, and he would read various passages in aloud for others. However, Byron's attitude caused problems between him and the administration at Harrow (markedly, he led a rebellion among the boys against the new headmaster, the Revd Dr George Butler) and during the 1804 Christmas holidays, Byron, at Drury's prompting, wanted to leave the school. However, Carlisle intervened and Byron stayed at Harrow until July 1805. He was accepted at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he went up the following October.\n\nWhile not at school or college, Byron lived with his mother at Burgage Manor in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Although there was some antagonism between mother and son, Byron cultivated friendships with Elizabeth Pigot and her brother, John, with whom he staged two plays for the delight of the community, along with Augusta Mary Byron, his half-sister. During this time, with the help of Elizabeth Pigot, who copied many of his rough drafts, he was encouraged to write his first volumes of poetry. \"Fugitive Pieces\" was the first, printed by Ridge of Newark, which contained poems written when Byron was only 14. However, it was promptly recalled and burned on the advice of his friend, the Reverend Thomas Becher, on account of its more amorous verses, particularly the poem \"To Mary\". The second edition impression of the book, called \"Poems on Various Occasions\" printed in January 1807, was given to John Pigot as a gift that he cherished until his death.\n\nInstead of Cambridge, Byron originally wanted to go to Christ Church, Oxford but there were no vacancies. Instead, he chose Cambridge at Drury's recommendation. The choice did not matter, since college life in general did not suit his personality. He wrote in his diary, \"I was so completely alone in this new world that it half broke my spirits... It was one of the deadliest and heaviest feelings of my life that I was no longer a boy\". However, this did not mitigate his contempt towards the other students, and he quickly grew dissatisfied with the society surrounding Cambridge: \"It is the \"Devil\" or at least his principal residence. They call it the University, but any other appellation would have suited it better, for Study is the last pursuit of the Society\".\n\nHe spent his time with Long, and the two would swim, ride, read, and talk with each other. However, they shared a fear of becoming overweight, and this marked the beginning of Byron's \"Thinning Campaign\". Long was not Byron's only companion during this time; he had a short-lived friendship with John Edleston, a fifteen-year-old choirboy. About his \"protégé\" he wrote, \"He has been my \"almost constant\" associate since October, 1805. His \"voice\" first attracted my attention, his \"countenance\" fixed it, and his \"manners\" attached me to him for ever.\" The boy gave Byron a carnelian ring, in return for saving his life, and to which Byron wrote \"The Cornelian\" in October 1806:\nThe two planned to live together after Edleston grew older, but the two parted and Byron would never see the boy again as Edleston died from consumption in 1811. As well as spending time with friends, Byron did join in with the rest of the community; however, he did not enjoy this time because, as he said, \"I could not share in the commonplace libertinism of the place and time without disgust. And yet this very disgust, and my heart thrown back upon itself, threw me into excesses perhaps more fatal than those from which I shrunk, as fixing upon one (at a time) the passions which, spread amongst many, would have hurt only myself\".\n\nLord Byron (main article)\n\n"}

He constantly denied the Egyptian national team all scoring opportunities. Chaouchi was only 23 years of age at the time of the play-off and played in place of suspended Lounès Gaouaoui. It was only Chaouchi's third cap during the unforgettable night in Al Merreikh Stadium, Omdurman (Sudan). In 2010, Chaouchi was known to have been Algeria's highest-paid footballer, earning roughly around 13 million Algerian dinars.\n\nChaouchi was not employed by an soccer team during the 2013-14 season, and has not been called up by the Algerian national team since 2010.\n\nBorn in Bordj Ménaïel, Boumerdès, Chaouchi was born to Houria and Rachid Chaouchi a former goalkeeper himself that played for JS Bordj Ménaïel. It was his father Rachid Chaouchi that noticed Faouzi's talent when he watched him play with other children in their neighbourhood. A few days later Faouzi asked his father if he could sign the authorization form so that he could join the JS Bordj Ménaïel youth team. According to his mother he abandoned his education in favour of having a career in what he loved most – football, which angered her at the time, but acknowledged that she knew he had a great future ahead of him in football at the time.\n\nChaouchi began his career playing for his hometown club JS Bordj Ménaïel. He was the captain of the team during the 2005/06 season. His good form that season, conceding just seven goals in 32 games, had begun to create interest from other clubs.\n\nChaouchi signed for JS Kabylie from Inter-Régions club JS Bordj Ménaïel in 2006. It was confirmed that the goalkeeper was joining after agreeing terms and signing a three-year contract. He was pleased to be joining such a club \n\nHe won the Algerian Championnat National in 2008, which was his greatest achievement as well as the highlight of his three season spell at the club from 2006 to 2009. He is also remembered by the canary fans for scoring a penalty against Cotonsport Garoua in the CAF Champions League with a powerful shot. He was nicknamed “The Canary” by the supporters of the club and is fondly remembered.\n\nWhilst at JS Kabylie, Chaouchi was rumoured to be leaving the club at the end of the season and had talks with various clubs such as Lille OSC, ES Sétif and MC Alger. Chaouchi had a string of discipline problems with manager's and the team president since replacing Gaouaoui in the starting line up in the 2007/08 season.\n\nChaouchi signed for ES Sétif in June 2009, after the club won the race to recruit the goalkeeper who was known for his outstanding performances at JS Kabylie, where he had shown his abilities and his dramatic shot stopping. He was also known for his extrovert humour prior to making his move to ES Sétif.\n\nIn December 2009, Chaouchi helped his side win the North African Cup of Champions tournament by beating ES Tunis in the final, after a penalty shoot-out. Chaouchi was selected as the best goalkeeper in the tournament. On 1 May 2010, Chaouchi played in the final of the Algerian Cup (coupe d'Algerie) against CA Batna by winning 3–0 and helping the club lift the Algerian Cup for the first time in twenty years and the seventh in their history, with the last being in 1989. The Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika presented the trophy with the head of state presenting the medals.\n\nIn 2009, a number of European clubs had shown an interest in Chaouchi, predominantly Olympique de Marseille. In 2010, during an interview a few days after the win against CA Batna in the Algerian Cup final he was asked if he had received any new offers from clubs abroad, he replied by confirming that his agent had been informed that representatives from Olympique de Marseille will be attending the friendly between the Republic of Ireland and Algeria in Dublin on 28 May 2010 to have another look at him. whilst also confirming that he is still in contact with French club Le Mans since the previous transfer window. He also confirmed he had just received a proposal from a club in the gulf, but didn't want to mention the club as he had no interest in joining any Arabian clubs as he wanted to join an ambitious club based in Europe.\n\nOn 17 October 2010, there were reports that Chaouchi was involved in a car accident. These reports were verified, stating that Chaouchi was involved in a minor car accident whilst visiting family and friends in his home-town Bordj Ménaïel. According to the reports he did not sustain any serious injuries, but the car was damaged beyond repair.\n\nOn 30 November, the Ligue National de football disciplinary committee decided to give a one match ban to Chaouchi, and a fine of 20.000,00 Algerian dinars along with Khaled Lemmouchia for contesting the decision of the penalty against AS Khroub, which ended 3–3. He was suspended for the game against MC Oran.\n\nOn 19 July 2011, Chaouchi joined MC Alger, signing a one-year contract with the club. In June 2012, Chaouchi flew to Turkey to negotiate contract offers with newly promoted Süper Lig clubs Elazığspor and Kasımpaşa S.K..\n\nChaouchi received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on 4 February 2008 for training which was due to be held in France, after his good form for club JS Kabylie did not go unnoticed by the national team coach Saâdane. On 26 March 2008, he made his debut for Algeria in a friendly against DR Congo coming on as a substitute at half-time for Lounès Gaouaoui.\n\nOn 18 November 2009, Chaouchi was selected to play fierce rivals Egypt in what was to be the most important game of his football career, the reward being the remaining African place for the 2010 World Cup finals as first-choice goalkeeper Lounès Gaouaoui was ruled out through suspension.\n\nIn December 2009, Chaouchi was selected by Saâdane to play in the 2010 African Cup of Nations hosted in Angola. He was normally regarded as second-choice goalkeeper under coach Rabah Saâdane, who had been using Lounès Gaouaoui as his first-choice goalkeeper,\nbut due to Chaouchi's heroic performance in Khartoum and Lounès Gaouaoui withdrawing from the 2010 African Cup of Nations due to an attack of acute appendicitis, Rabah Saâdane did not hesitate in using Chaouchi as first-choice goalkeeper in the 2010 African Cup of Nations. Chaouchi's sending off in the semi-final against Egypt for receiving two cautions along with his head-butting of referee Coffi Codjia saw him earn a suspension for 3 matches and $10,000 fine from CAF.\n\nChaouchi started his country's first match of the World Cup against Slovenia and was at fault for the Slovenian winner scored by captain Robert Koren. The goalkeeper allowed the shot to squirm past his body, condemning Algeria to a 1–0 defeat. He was replaced by Rais M'Bohli for the match against England.\n\n\n"}

On January 31, 2011, he was sent to Egypt by President Barack Obama to negotiate a resolution to the popular protests against the regime that had swept the country. A White House spokesman said that Wisner had vast experience in the region as well as close relationships with many Egyptians in and out of government. The New York Times reports that he is a personal friend of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. Speaking on the BBC on February 5, 2011, he exceeded statements issued by the White House to date and insisted that President Mubarak should be allowed to remain in office despite widespread calls for him to step down.\n\nHe works as an international-affairs advisor at the firm of Squire Patton Boggs in Washington, DC.\n\nWisner was born in New York on July 2, 1938. He joined the State Department as a Foreign Service Officer in December 1961.\n\nIn 1976, at the beginning of the Carter administration, he served under Cyrus Vance as Deputy Executive Secretary of the Department of State. Among his overseas assignments, Wisner served as the United States Ambassador to Zambia (1979–82); Egypt (1986–91), the Philippines (1991–92), and India, 1994–97.\n\nDuring his tenure in Lusaka he played the role of point man for the Constructive Engagement policy of assistant secretary of state for African affairs Chester Crocker. Wisner worked well with Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda and helped to rebuild bilateral relations between Zambia and the USA after a 1980 spy scandal at the U.S. embassy in Lusaka. Crocker's efforts contributed to the organization and successful discussions at the February 1984 Lusaka Conference regarding conflicts in Angola and Namibia.\n\nAfter retiring from government service in 1997, Wisner joined the board at a subsidiary of Enron, the former energy company and served on the board of American International Group (AIG).\n\nIn late 2002, Wisner co-chaired an independent working group which developed a model for the US's post-conflict role in Iraq, should an invasion occur. Their published recommendations included: establishment of law and order through the retraining of the Iraqi army, focusing on the distribution of humanitarian assistance and reestablishment of vital services, and the importance of avoiding the appointment of exiled Iraqi opposition leaders to dominant positions in the new government.\n\nWisner is an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. In 2012 he succeeded Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the board of trustees of International House, a cultural-exchange residence and program center in New York City. He also serves on the advisory board of the National Security Network, and on the board of Refugees International. He went on to become a member of the board for EOG Resources. In June 2013, Wisner joined the advisory board of Ergo, a global intelligence and advisory firm. Wisner is Chair of the Board of The Arab Gulf States Institute.\n\nIn early 2011, the Obama administration asked Wisner to carry views to Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, including advice that Mubarak should resign to defuse the crisis. Wisner was unsuccessful in convincing Mubarak to do so. Four days later, after a day in which Mubarak allies took violent reprisal against democracy activists, Wisner spoke to a security conference in Europe and called it \"crucial\" that Mubarak stay on in the interest of \"stability\". The State Department immediately disavowed his comments and said Wisner had not been serving as an envoy but as a conduit for certain administration views.\n\n"}

Denver\n\nJames William \"Jim\" Denver (October 23, 1817 – August 9, 1892) was an American politician, soldier and lawyer. He served in the California state government, as an officer in the United States Army in two wars, and as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from California. He served as secretary and Governor of the Kansas Territory during the struggle over whether or not Kansas would be open to slavery. The city of Denver, Colorado, is named after him.\n\nJames W. Denver was born near Winchester, Virginia. He attended public schools and moved to Ohio with his parents in 1830, settling near Wilmington. In 1841 he taught school in Missouri, and in 1844 he graduated from the law school of the University of Cincinnati. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law near Xenia, Ohio. He moved to Platte City, Missouri, in 1845, where he continued his law practice and acting career.\n\nIn 1847, during the Mexican–American War, he recruited a company for the 12th U.S. Volunteer Infantry and was commissioned a captain, serving under General Winfield Scott. After the war in 1850, Denver traveled to California, where he became a trader. Denver killed newspaper editor Edward Gilbert in a duel on August 2, 1852. Later that same year, he was elected to the California State Senate. He was later appointed as Secretary of State of California. In 1854 he was elected to the United States Congress as representative from California, serving from March 4, 1855 – March 3, 1857. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1856. On April 17, 1857, President James Buchanan appointed him as Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nOn June 17, 1857, Denver was appointed by Buchanan as Secretary of the Kansas Territory. In December 1857 he was appointed as Territorial Governor. On the day that Denver assumed the territorial governorship, citizens in the territory voted on the Lecompton Constitution, which opened the territory to slavery. The vote offered a choice only between full slavery and limited slavery in the territory and was thus largely boycotted by Free-Staters who were in favor of abolishing slavery. The pro-slavery constitution passed by an overwhelming margin. Later it was discovered that several thousand votes were cast fraudulently by \"Border Ruffians\" who had crossed into the territory from Missouri in order to cast pro-slavery ballots (The vote was overturned by a subsequent election in August 1858, and Kansas was later admitted to the Union, in 1861, as a free state. See Bleeding Kansas for details.).\nIn November 1858, while Denver was still serving as territorial governor, William Larimer, Jr., a land speculator from Leavenworth, planted the townsite of \"Denver City\" along the South Platte River in Arapaho County in western Kansas Territory (the present-day state of Colorado). Larimer chose the name \"Denver\" to honor the current territorial governor with the intention that the city would be chosen as the county seat of Arapaho County. It was actually William McGaa and William Larimer who got the settlement of St. Charles at the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River to change its name to Denver in hope of becoming the county seat.\n\nDenver retired as territorial governor in November 1858 and was reappointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs, serving until his resignation on March 31, 1859.\n\nA few months after the start of the American Civil War in early 1861, President Abraham Lincoln commissioned Denver a brigadier general in the volunteer army on August 14. In November 1861, he was ordered to report to Fort Scott in Kansas and in December, he assumed command of all Federal troops in Kansas. During March and April 1862 he commanded the District of Kansas until he was transferred to the District of West Tennessee. On 16 May 1862, Denver assumed command of the 3rd Brigade/5th Division under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in the midst of the Siege of Corinth. The very next day Denver's brigade participated in the fight for Russell's House. Though his brigade suffered no casualties in this engagement it was nonetheless one of the two brigades leading the attack. On May 27 General Sherman again selected Denver's brigade to be one of the leading units in an attack against the Double Log House. Denver and Morgan L. Smith's brigade successfully stormed the log cabin turned block house. During this engagement Major General Ulysses S. Grant was present on the battlefield and indicated his approval of the handsome manner in which the troops behaved. After the fall of Corinth Denver continued in command of his brigade, serving on garrison duty in Mississippi. During the early stages of the Vicksburg Campaign Denver was in command of the 1st Division, XVI Corps until his resignation from the Union Army on March 5, 1863.\n\nAfter the war, Denver practiced law in Washington, D.C., and Wilmington, Ohio; he and his family lived in the Rombach Place while residing in Wilmington. He served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1876, 1880, and 1884. He was mentioned as a possible Democratic presidential nominee in 1876 and 1884, although his name was never offered into formal nomination.\n\nDenver reportedly visited Denver, Colorado in 1875 and 1882, but complained that his visits received little affection from the residents of the city named after him. The second visit makes Denver the only person to have spent time in his or her namesake city after it became a U.S. state capital.\n\nHe died in Washington, D.C. in 1892 and is buried in Sugar Grove Cemetery in Wilmington, Ohio.\n\nHis son, Matthew R. Denver, was a U.S. Congressman from Ohio from 1907–1913.\n\n\n"}

Returning to Paris in 1797, he wrote for \"La Quotidienne\" but was forced to emgirate again after 18 Fructidor, not without first spending two months in the Prison du Temple. He returned to France again after 18 Brumaire, but soon afterwards left for Saint-Domingue as secretary to general Leclerc on the Saint-Domingue expedition. On his return from the expedition, he was made head of the bureau des théâtres under the interior minister thanks to the protection of Savary. Soon after this, however, he left once again to follow admiral Villaret de Joyeuse to Martinique.\n\nEsménard then came back to France for good, where he received favours from the imperial government for services rendered - censor of theatres and libraries, censor of the \"Journal de l'Empire\" and chef de division to the ministry of police. In 1810, he was elected to the Académie française.\n\nFor having published a satirical article against one of Napoleon's envoys to Russia in the \"Journal de l'Empire\", he was exiled to Italy for a few months. On his return trip he died in a carriage accident at Fondi, near Naples.\n\nEsménard is best known for the didactic and descriptive poem entitled \"La Navigation\", first published in 8 verses in 1805, then re-edited to 6 verses in 1806. It is a precise work, drawn from observations made by the author in the course of his travels. Its versification, however, is monotonous and it is marked by a total absence of action and movement.\n\nEsménard wrote \"Le triomphe de Trajan\", a three-act opera with music by Jean-François Lesueur, on the life of Trajan but full of flattering allusions to Napoleon I of France.

His parents were Frenchman Juan Francisco Duquesne, originally from Montpellier, and Clara Ignacia de la Madrid, from Bogotá. He attended the \"Colegio Mayor y Seminario de San Bartolomé\" graduating in 1774 in canon law and theology. Remarkable for his day and studies, during his dissertation on philosophy Duquesne treated the natural sciences.\n\nFrom 1775 to 1795 Duquesne was assigned to the indigenous villages Lenguazaque and Gachancipá and studied Muysccubun, the language of the Muisca. This was the first recorded study of the almost extinct language as education in the language was forbidden by the authorities of the Spanish Empire in 1577 and in 1638 the last bilingual school was closed. After ten years of service in Lenguazaque, as of July 13, 1785 Duquesne was working in the parrochy of the church in Gachancipá.\n\nIn 1795 Duquesne published his work \"Disertación sobre el calendario de los muyscas, indios naturales de este Nuevo Reino de Granada\" (\"Dissertation about the calendar of the Muyscas [sic], native indians of this New Kingdom of Granada\"). In this work he unraveled the complex lunisolar Muisca calendar. José Celestino Mutis handed Duquesne's work over to the famous natural scientist Alexander von Humboldt who visited the Colombian territories in 1801.\n\nAfter publishing his work on the Muisca calendar, the Muisca numerals and grammar of the Chibcha language, Duquesne was appointed canon of the cathedral of Bogotá, by Charles IV, the King of Spain in 1800.

He attended the University of Chicago, graduating in 1941.\n\nHe worked as a chemist at the Clinton Laboratories (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) during the World War II Manhattan Project, engaged in separating, identifying and characterizing the radioactive elements produced by nuclear fission. In 1945, he, together with Jacob A. Marinsky and Charles D. Coryell, isolated the previously undocumented rare-earth element 61. Marinsky and Glendenin produced promethium both by extraction from fission products and by bombarding neodymium with neutrons. They isolated it using ion-exchange chromatography. Publication of the finding was delayed until later due to the war. In September 1947, Marinsky and Glendenin announced the discovery at a meeting of the American Chemical Society. Upon the suggestion of Coryell's wife, the team named the new element for the titan Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and was punished for the act by Zeus. They had also considered naming it \"clintonium\" for the facility where it was isolated.\n\nIn 1945, Glendenin and 154 other Manhattan Project scientists signed the Szilárd petition. The petition urged President Harry S. Truman not to use the first atomic bomb \"without restriction\", urging him instead to \"describe and demonstrate\" its power and give Japan \"the opportunity to consider the consequences of further refusal to surrender\".\n\nIn 1949, Glendenin earned his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

{"id": "304736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304736", "title": "Marsh Arabs", "text": "Marsh Arabs\n\nThe Marsh Arabs ( \"ʻArab al-Ahwār\" \"Arabs of the Marshlands\"), also referred to as the Maʻdān ( \"dweller in the plains\") or shroog (, \"those from the east\")—the latter two often considered derogatory in the present day—are inhabitants of the Tigris-Euphrates marshlands in the south and east of Iraq as well as in the Hoveyzieh marshes of Southwest Iran.\n\nComprising members of many different tribes and tribal confederations, such as the Āl Bū Muḥammad, Ferayghāt, Shaghanbah and Banī Lām, the Maʻdān had developed a unique culture centered on the marshes' natural resources. Many of the marshes' inhabitants were displaced when the wetlands were drained during and after the 1991 uprisings in Iraq.\n\nThe term Maʻdān was used disparagingly by desert tribes to refer to those inhabiting the Iraqi river basins, as well as by those who farmed in the river basins to refer to the population of the marshes.\n\nThe Maʻdān speak a local variety of Mesopotamian Arabic and traditionally wore a variant of normal Arab dress: for males, a \"thawb\" (\"long shirt\"; in recent times, occasionally with a Western-style jacket over the top) and a \"keffiyeh\" (\"headcloth\") worn twisted around the head in a turban, as few could afford an \"ʻiqāl\".\n\nThe society of the Marsh Arabs was divided into two main groups by occupation. One group bred and raised water buffalo while others cultivated crops such as rice, barley, wheat and pearl millet; they also kept some sheep and cattle. Rice cultivation was especially important; it was carried out in small plots cleared in April and sown in mid-May. Cultivation seasons were marked by the rising and setting of certain stars, such as the Pleiades and Sirius.\n\nSome branches of the Maʻdān were nomadic pastoralists, erecting temporary dwellings and moving buffalo around the marshes according to the season. Some fishing, especially of species of barbel (notably the binni or \"bunni\", \"Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi\"), was practised using spears and datura poison, but large-scale fishing using nets was until recent times regarded as a dishonourable profession by the Maʻdān and was mostly carried out by a separate low-status tribe known as the \"Berbera\". By the early 1990s, however, up to 60% of the total amount of fish caught in Iraq's inland waters came from the marshes.\n\nIn the later twentieth century a third main occupation entered Marsh Arab life; the weaving of reed mats on a commercial scale. Though they often earned far more than workers in agriculture, weavers were looked down upon by both Maʻdān and farmers alike: however, financial concerns meant that it gradually gained acceptance as a respectable profession.\n\nThe majority of Marsh Arabs are Twelver Shiʿi Muslims, though in the marshes small communities of Mandaic-speaking Mandaeans (often working as boat builders and craftsmen) live alongside them. The inhabitants' long association with tribes within Persia may have influenced the spread of the Shī‘ī denomination within the marshes. Wilfred Thesiger commented that while he met few Marsh Arabs who had performed the Hajj, many of them had made the pilgrimage to Mashhad (thereby earning the title \"Zair\"); a number of families also claimed descent from Muhammad, adopting the title of \"sayyid\" and dyeing their \"keffiyeh\" green.\n\nThe Maʻdān carried out the majority of their devotions in private as there were no places of worship within the Marshes; some were known to visit Ezra's Tomb, one of the few religious sites of any kind in the area.\n\nAs with most tribes of southern Iraq, the main authority was the tribal shaikh. To this day, the shaikh of a Marsh Arab group will collect a tribute from his tribe in order to maintain the \"mudhif\", the tribal guesthouse, which acts as the political, social, judicial and religious centre of Marsh Arabic life. The \"mudhif\" is used as a place to settle disputes, to carry out diplomacy with other tribes and as a gathering point for religious and other celebrations. It is also the place where visitors are offered hospitality. Although the tribal shaykh was the principal figure, each Maʻdān village (which may have contained members of several different tribes) would also follow the authority of the hereditary \"qalit\" \"headman\" of a tribe's particular section.\n\nBlood feuds, which could only be settled by the \"qalit\", were a feature of Marsh Arab life, in common with that of the Arab bedouin. Many of the Marsh Arabs' codes of behaviour were similar to those of the desert tribes.\n\nMost Marsh Arabs lived in arched reed houses considerably smaller than a \"mudhif\". The typical dwelling was usually a little more than two meters wide, about six meters long, and a little less than three meters high, and was either constructed at the waterside or on an artificial island of reeds called a \"kibasha\"; a more permanent island of layered reeds and mud was called a \"dibin\". Houses had entrances at both ends and a screen in the middle; one end was used as a dwelling and the other end (sometimes extended with a \"sitra\", a long reed structure) was used to shelter animals in bad weather. A \"raba\" was a higher-status dwelling, distinguished by a north-facing entrance, which also served as a guesthouse where there was no \"mudhif\". Traditional boats (the \"mashoof\" and \"tarada\") were used as transport: the Maʻdān would drive buffalo through the reedbeds during the season of low water to create channels, which would then be kept open by constant use, for the boats.\n\nThe marsh environment meant that certain diseases, such as schistosomiasis and malaria, were endemic; Maʻdānī agriculture and homes were also vulnerable to periodic droughts and flooding.\n\nThe origins of the Maʻdān are still a matter of some interest. British colonial ethnographers found it difficult to classify some of the Maʻdān's social customs and speculated that they might have originated in India.\n\nMany scholars have proposed historical and genetic links between the Marsh Arabs and the ancient Sumerians based on shared agricultural practices and methods of house-building. There is, however, no written record of the marsh tribes until the ninth century, and the Sumerians lost their distinct ethnic identity by around 1800 BCE, some 2700 years before. Others, however, have noted that much of the culture of the Maʻdān is in fact shared with the desert bedouin who came to the area after the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate, and that it is therefore likely that they are descended from this source, at least in part.\n\nA 2011 Study showed that Marsh Arabs have a high concentration of Y-chomosomal Haplogroup J-M267 and mtDNA haplogroup J having the highest concentration, with haplogroups H, U and T following. According to this study, Marsh Arabs have the following haplogroups.\n\nThe marshes had for some time been considered a refuge for elements persecuted by the government of Saddam Hussein, as in past centuries they had been a refuge for escaped slaves and serfs, such as during the Zanj Rebellion. By the mid-1980s, a low-level insurgency against Ba'athist drainage and resettlement projects had developed in the area, led by Sheik Abdul Kerim Mahud al-Muhammadawi of the Al bu Muhammad under the \"nom de guerre\" Abu Hatim.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the expansion of irrigation projects had begun to disrupt the flow of water to the marshes. However, after the First Gulf War (1991), the Iraqi government aggressively revived a program to divert the flow of the Tigris River and the Euphrates River away from the marshes in retribution for a failed Shia uprising. This was done primarily to eliminate the food source(s) of the Marsh Arabs and to prevent any remaining militiamen from taking refuge in the marshes, the Badr Brigades and other militias having used them as cover. The plan, which was accompanied by a series of propaganda articles by the Iraqi regime directed against the Ma'dan, systematically converted the wetlands into a desert, forcing the residents out of their settlements in the region. Villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned.\n\nThe majority of the Maʻdān were displaced either to areas adjacent to the drained marshes, abandoning their traditional lifestyle in favour of conventional agriculture, to towns and camps in other areas of Iraq or to Iranian refugee camps. Only 1,600 of them were estimated to still be living on traditional \"dibins\" by 2003. The western Hammar Marshes and the Qurnah or Central Marshes had become completely desiccated, while the eastern Hawizeh Marshes had dramatically shrunk. The Marsh Arabs, who numbered about half a million in the 1950s, have dwindled to as few as 20,000 in Iraq, according to the United Nations. An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 have fled to refugee camps in Iran.\n\nObserver Middle East correspondent Shyam Bhatia who spent two weeks with the Marsh Arabs in 1993 wrote the first eye witness account of Iraqi army tactics at the time of draining the marshes, bombing Marsh villages and then sowing mines in the water before retreating. Bhatia's extensive reportage won him the title of International Reporter of the Year, although exclusive film footage of the time he spent in the area has never been projected.\n\nWith the breaching of dikes by local communities subsequent to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ending of a four-year drought that same year, the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery. The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50% of 1970s levels, with a remarkable regrowth of the Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes and some recovery of the Central Marshes.\n\nEfforts to restore the marshes have led to signs of their gradual revivification as water is restored to the former desert, but the whole ecosystem may take far longer to restore than it took to destroy. Only a few thousand of the nearly half million Marsh Arabs remain in the area in Maysan Governorate, Dhi Qar Governorate and Basra Governorate. Most of the rest that can be accounted for are refugees living in other Shi'i areas in Iraq, or have emigrated to Iran, and many do not wish to return to their former home and lifestyle, which despite its independence was characterised by extreme poverty and hardship. A report by the United States Agency for International Development noted that while some Maʻdān had chosen to return to their traditional activities in the marshes, especially the Hammar Marshes, within a short time of reflooding, they were without clean drinking water, sanitation, health care or education facilities. In addition, it is still uncertain if the marshes will completely recover, given increased levels of water extraction from the Tigris and Euphrates.\n\nMany of the resettled Marsh Arabs have gained representation through the Hezbollah Movement in Iraq; others have become followers of Muqtada al-Sadr's movement, through which they gained political control of Maysan Governorate. Political instability and local feuds, aggravated by the poverty of the dispossessed Marsh Arab population, remain a serious problem. Rory Stewart observed that throughout history, the Maʻdān were the pawn of many rulers and became expert dissimulators. The tribal chiefs are outwardly submissive and work with the coalition and Iraqi officials. Behind the scenes, the tribes engage in smuggling and other activities.\n\nPietro Della Valle (1586–1652) is cited in Gavin Young's \"Return to the Marshes\" as the earliest modern traveler to write about Mesopotamia and probably the first to introduce the word \"Madi\", which he spelled \"Maedi,\" to the Western world.\n\nYoung also mentions George Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle (1799–1891) as having spent time with the Madan in 1824 and reported in detail on the marsh inhabitants. Of the men Keppel wrote, \"The Arab boatmen were as hardy and muscular-looking fellows as ever I saw. One loose brown shirt, of the coarseness of sack-cloth, was the only covering of the latter. This, when labour required it, was thrown aside, and discovered forms most admirably adapted to their laborious avocations; indeed, any of the boatmen would have made an excellent model for an Hercules; and one in particular, with uncombed hair and shaggy beard, struck us all with the resemblance he bore to statues of that deity.\" Of the women Keppel observed, \"They came to our boat with the frankness of innocence and there was a freedom in their manners, bordering perhaps on the masculine; nevertheless their fine features and well-turned limbs produced a \"tout ensemble\" of beauty, not to be surpassed perhaps in the brilliant assemblies of civilized life.\"\n\nAnother account of the Maʻdān in English was jointly published in 1927 by a British colonial administrator, Stuart Edwin Hedgecock, and his wife. Gertrude Bell also visited the area. T. E. Lawrence passed through in 1916, stopping at Basra and Ezra's Tomb (Al-Azair), and recorded that the Marsh Arabs were \"wonderfully hard [...] but merry, and full of talk. They are in the water all their lives, and seem hardly to notice it.\"\n\nThe way of life of the Marsh Arabs was later described by the explorer Wilfred Thesiger in his classic \"The Marsh Arabs\" (1964). Thesiger lived with the Marsh Arabs for months at a time over a seven-year period (1951–1958), building excellent relationships with virtually all he met, and recording the details of day-to-day life in various regions of the marshes. Many of the areas that he visited have since been drained. Gavin Maxwell, the Scottish naturalist, travelled with Thesiger through the marshes in 1956 and published an account of their travels in his 1957 book \"A Reed Shaken by the Wind\" (later republished under the title \"People of the Reeds\"). The journalist and travel writer Gavin Young followed in Thesiger's footsteps, writing \"Return to the Marshes: Life with the Marsh Arabs of Iraq\" (1977; reissued 2009).\n\nThe first extensive scholarly ethnographic account of Marsh Arab life was \"Marsh Dwellers of the Euphrates Delta\" (1962), by Iraqi anthropologist S. M. Salim. An ethnoarchaeological study of the material culture of the Marsh Arabs has been published by Edward L. Ochsenschlager: \"Iraq's Marsh Arabs in the Garden of Eden\" (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2004).\n\nRory Stewart described the Marsh Arabs and his experiences as deputy governor in the Maysan province (2003–2004) in his 2006 book, \"The Prince of the Marshes\" (also published under the title \"Occupational Hazards\").\n\nIn 2011, Sam Kubba published \"The Iraqi Marshlands and the Marsh Arabs: The Ma'dan, Their Culture and the Environment\". The Iraqi Marshlands and the Marsh Arabs details the rich cultural legacy and lifestyle that survives today only as a fragmented cultural inheritance.\n\nIn German, there are Sigrid Westphal-Hellbusch und Heinz Westphal, \"Die Ma'dan: Kultur und Geschichte der Marschenbewohner im Süd-Iraq\" (Berlin: Duncker und Humblot, 1962). Sigrid Westphal Hellbusch and her husband Heinz Westphal wrote a comprehensive study on the Madan based on research and observation obtained while living with Madan tribes. These observations outline how the Madan diverge from other Shia communities.\n\nFilms about Marsh Arabs:\n\n\n"}

As of the 2014 season, he is the youngest player to have appeared in CPL matches.\n\nFrom McBean, north of Couva, Pooran attended Naparima College in San Fernando, and played for the school's cricket team. A left-handed wicket-keeper/batsman, he represented Trinidad and Tobago at various underage and schoolboys tournaments, and made his national under-19 debut at the 2012 regional tournament, aged only 16.\n\nPooran debuted for the West Indies under-19s in October 2013, in a bilateral series against the Bangladesh under-19s, and went on to play at the 2014 Under-19 World Cup. The team's vice-captain and primary wicket-keeper, he scored 303 runs from six matches, ranking fourth for total runs and leading the West Indies' averages.\n\nThis included half-centuries against Canada and India, and an innings of 143 runs against Australia (from a team total of 208 all out), which was the highest score of the tournament and was subsequently described as \"one of the most memorable innings under pressure in the tournament's history\". Pooran's innings was the highest ever under-19 ODI score against Australia, and his 136-run ninth-wicket partnership with Barbadian Jerome Jones was a record for all under-19 matches.\n\nBefore playing at international under-19 level, Pooran had played four matches for Trinidad and Tobago in the domestic one-day Regional Super50 competition, in February and March 2013.\n\nPrior to the inaugural 2013 CPL season, he was selected in the squad of the Red Steel, Trinidad's CPL franchise, and aged 17, was the youngest player in the competition. On debut against the Guyana Amazon Warriors, he scored 54 from 24 balls, an innings which included six sixes and was noted for its \"clean, calm stroke play\" and \"uninhibited aggression\".

Between college and graduate school, she worked in agricultural development as a consultant for CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) in Italy, and then became a Fulbright scholar in Cote d’Ivoire. After her year in Africa, she returned to the United States to attend Harvard University, where she received her PhD in molecular biology. She did her doctoral work in the laboratory of Dr. Kami Ahmad, where she ultimately published her dissertation, \"Histone dimers on the move: Nucleosome assembly systems for H2A and H2AV in \"Drosophila\".\" \n\nDudnik had personally felt the effects of lack of access to scientific resources in developing countries when doing her Fulbright work in Côte d'Ivoire, where she was working to breed better varieties of rice. There, she saw a gap between a wealth of scientific talent and a dearth of access to research equipment to put that talent to use. When she returned to the United States to pursue her doctoral degree, she worked to bridge that gap. She led a group of fellow students in collecting surplus biological equipment and supplies at Harvard University to send to labs in developing countries to support the research they were doing at their local institutions. This effort became the basis of Seeding Labs, which formally launched in 2007 when Dudnik was awarded the Echoing Green fellowship. A year later, Seeding Labs was established as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in 2008.\n\nDudnik and her team have since expanded Seeding Labs beyond equipment transfer, developing exchange programs to train scientists from developing countries in America. She has promoted the organization's vision as a TEDGlobal Fellow, a PopTech Social Innovation Fellow, and at the World Economic Forum. They have received funding and support from a combination of government organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, academic institutions like Harvard University, and private companies like Merck.\n\nDudnik has written on the need to build scientific capacity in developing countries to take on the world's most pressing health challenges for outlets like \"Scientific American,\" \"Time\", and \"Quartz\", drawing attention to the lack of funding and research support for countries in the global South.

He moved to Ishigaki Island as a young adult, and became the chief of Ōhama Village (today part of Ishigaki City) soon afterward. His influence soon extended over all of Ishigaki Island, and beyond, to other islands in the Yaeyama Islands group. At some point late in the 15th century, the nearby Miyako Islands were divided between two influential families, the Nakasone and Kaneshigawa, who were fighting one another for dominance of the area. Seeking to take advantage of the chaos and disunity, Akahachi proposed an invasion of the Miyako Islands. However, Nakasone Toyomiya led a counterattack against Akahachi, overwhelming his forces and moving on to attack Yonaguni Island as well.\n\nAt this time, the Ryukyu Kingdom, based at Shuri on Okinawa Island, did not yet have direct control over the Yaeyama or Miyako Islands, but merely expected tribute to be paid.

After Nakasone conquered Yaeyama, a force of roughly 3,000 Ryukyuan troops was sent by King Shō Shin in 1500, and the rebellion was suppressed with the annexation of the Sakishima Islands.\n\nWhile official records and histories produced by the Ryukyu Kingdom label Oyake Akahachi as a rebel and a traitor, locally on Ishigaki and the surrounding islands he is known as a hero who sought to secure their freedom and independence.

Both his parents came from bourgeois families active in the wine retailing industry. Palloy was educated at the \"College d'Harcourt\", where many of the students were from upper-class liberal backgrounds. He left school at the age of fifteen to join the French Royal Army as a cadet and then as an officer. On leaving this career at the age of twenty, he married the daughter of a building contractor and joined the trade himself, eventually taking over his new family's business. By 1789 he had made the company one of the largest building firms in Paris, employing 400 workers.\n\nWhen the Bastille fell on 14 July 1789 there was some debate as to what should replace it, or indeed if it should remain as a monument to the past. However, Palloy knew exactly what he wanted to do and by that evening had begun the process of dismantling the structure; he secured the contract to demolish the building two days later. Most of the building was removed over the subsequent months by approximately 1,000 workers. The dimension stones were reused for the construction of the Pont de la Concorde.\n\nAlthough Palloy did not receive the official payment for several years, he knew how to profit from the possession of such an iconic structure in the meantime. Staff conducted tours, for a fee, to show the public around the basements and dungeons with skeletons as props. Palloy labelled himself a patriot and emphasised the symbolism of the Bastille, writing speeches, painting pictures, and even arranging celebratory festivals and theatrical reconstructions of the day the Bastille fell. He sold other parts as souvenirs including replica Bastilles made from the \nstones of the building itself. He even sent examples of these miniatures to each of the 83 departments asking only to be reimbursed for transport and postage.\n\nIn early 1794 Palloy was held in prison on charges of embezzlement and of being a Hébertist but was released after two months.

He is also a former Member of Parliament and mutineer, having led a mutiny of Trinidad and Tobago Regiment in 1970. He was born the son of a sugar cane worker and housewife in March 1946. His early education was at Presentation College, Chaguanas, where he gained a Grade I Cambridge School Certificate. He later won a cadetship to the prestigious British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst between 1964 and 1966.\n\nAs a Lieutenant in the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, he led an army mutiny in 1970. In the midst of Black Power riots, the People's National Movement government led by Eric Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency April, 1970 and arrested several Black Power leaders and Trade Unionists. In a move to prevent Williams from using the military against the masses, a portion of the Regiment stationed at Teteron (on the Chaguaramas Peninsula), led by Lieutenants Shah and Rex Lassalle mutinied. In response, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard fired on the mutineers who returned to Teteron Barracks, abandoning their foray into Port of Spain. After ten days the mutineers surrendered. The leaders were court-martialed and Shah and Lasalle were jailed. They both went on to win their appeals at the local Court of Appeal, and judges at the Privy Council in London, England, ruled against the State's appeal in July, 1972. Shah, Lassalle and all the other mutineers were freed within 24 hours of that ruling.\n\nAfter being released from prison Shah joined the Trade Union movement leading the ICFTU, a body of cane farmers who sought to displace the government recognised organisation,TICFA. He, George Weekes and Basdeo Panday went on to found the United Labour Front in 1975 as a labor confederation and transformed it into a political party in 1976. During general election later that year, the ULF secured 10 of the 36 seats in Parliament and became the official Opposition. Basdeo Panday was appointed Leader of the Opposition, but following a bitter row in the party, Shah was able to displace him, and served as Leader of the Opposition between August 9, 1977 and March 31, 1978 when Panday regained control of the party.\n\nShah went on to lead the cane farmers and won an election to head the Trinidad Islandwide Cane Farmers' Association (TICFA), in 1998. He has been chairman of that organisation to date. Shah also served as editor of the \"Trinidad and Tobago Mirror\" newspaper for 17 years and today serves as an op-ed columnist in the \"Trinidad Express\" newspaper. He is also known as the man who founded the prestigious annual Clico Trinidad & Tobago International Marathon, an event that spawned road running throughout the Caribbean. He remained chairman of the organising committee until he stepped down in 2005.

He is one of the most successful musicians in Ukraine and has a degree in theoretical physics. By the year 2016, he had released 9 studio albums together with his band, Okean Elzy: \nand also one (1) acoustic album \"Tviy format\" (Your format, 2003).\nVakarchuk was born in Mukachevo, in western Ukraine, raised in a family of scientists. His mother and father were both university professors of physics. His father Ivan Vakarchuk is also former Education Minister.\n\nVakarchuk founded the band Okean Elzy (\"Ocean of Elza\"), in 1994 as an undergraduate at Lviv University. At this university he earned a Ph.D. in the field of supersymmetry. After graduation Vakarchuk moved to Kiev.\n\nIn 2005 Vakarchuk answered all questions correctly and won the grand prize (1 million hryvnias) for the first time on the Ukrainian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, called Khto khoche staty milyonerom? – Pershyi milyon.

Their performance in Kiev's Olympiyskiy Stadium broken the record for the largest number of people attending a concert by a Ukrainian band — over 75 thousand.\n\nIn 2015 Vakarchuk took part in the Yale World Fellows international fellowship program at Yale University.\n\nVakarchuk stated multiple times in 2017 that he had no political ambitions.. However, in 2018 he joined Stanford University as a visiting scholar, focusing on politics and leadership. Later that year he appeared at several political-themed conferences, speaking alongside established Ukrainian politicians . This led public to view him as a potential candidate for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election, where he is one of the frontrunners according to the opinion polls.\n\nVakarchuk also takes an active part in social and cultural projects, and is the founder of the Charity Fund \"Lyudi Maybutnyogo\" (People of the Future).

{"id": "338289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338289", "title": "The Tramp", "text": "The Tramp\n\nThe Tramp (\"Charlot\" in several languages), also known as The Little Tramp, was British actor Charlie Chaplin's most memorable on-screen character and an icon in world cinema during the era of silent film. \"The Tramp\" is also the title of a silent film starring Chaplin, which Chaplin wrote and directed in 1915.\n\nThe Tramp, as portrayed by Chaplin, is a childlike, bumbling but generally good-hearted character who is most famously portrayed as a vagrant who endeavors to behave with the manners and dignity of a gentleman despite his actual social status. However, while he is ready to take what paying work is available, he also uses his cunning to get what he needs to survive and escape the authority figures who will not tolerate his antics. Chaplin's films did not always portray the Tramp as a vagrant, however. The character (\"The little fellow,\" as Chaplin called him) was rarely referred to by any names on-screen, although he was sometimes identified as \"Charlie\" and rarely, as in the original silent version of \"The Gold Rush\", \"The little funny tramp\".\n\nThe character of the Tramp was originally created by accident while Chaplin was working at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, when dressing up for the short film \"Mabel's Strange Predicament\" starring Mabel Normand and Chaplin. In a 1933 interview, Chaplin explained how he came up with the look of the Tramp:\n\nThat was actually the first film featuring the Tramp but a different film, shot later but with the same character, happened to be released two days earlier. The Tramp debuted to the public in the Keystone comedy \"Kid Auto Races at Venice\" (released on February 7, 1914; \"Mabel's Strange Predicament\", shot earlier, was released on February 9, 1914). Chaplin, with his Little Tramp character, quickly became the most popular star in Keystone director Mack Sennett's company of players. Chaplin continued to play the Tramp through dozens of short films and, later, feature-length productions. (In only a handful of other productions did he play characters other than the Tramp).\n\nThe Tramp was closely identified with the silent era, and was considered an international character. When the sound era began in the late 1920s, Chaplin refused to make a talkie featuring the character, partly due to how the character was supposed to be American, and Chaplin himself had a strong and obvious British accent. The 1931 production \"City Lights\" featured no dialogue. Chaplin officially retired the character in the film \"Modern Times\" (released February 5, 1936), which appropriately ended with the Tramp walking down an endless highway toward the horizon. The film was only a partial talkie and is often called the last silent film. The Tramp remains silent until near the end of the film when, for the first time, his voice is finally heard, albeit only as part of a French/Italian-derived gibberish song. This allowed the Tramp to finally be given a voice but not tarnish his association with the silent era.\n\nIn \"The Great Dictator\", Chaplin's first film after \"Modern Times\", Chaplin plays the dual role of a Hitler-esque dictator, and a Jewish barber. Although Chaplin emphatically stated that the barber was not the Tramp, he retains the Tramp's moustache, hat, and general appearance. Despite a few silent scenes, including one where the barber is wearing the Tramp's coat and bowler hat and carrying his cane, the barber speaks throughout the film (using Chaplin's own British accent), including the passionate plea for peace that has been widely interpreted as Chaplin speaking as himself.\n\nIn 1959, having been editing \"The Chaplin Revue\", Chaplin commented to a reporter (regarding the Tramp character) \"I was wrong to kill him. There was room for the Little Man in the atomic age.\"\n\nA vaudeville performer named Lew Bloom created a similar tramp character which inspired Chaplin. According to Bloom, he was \"the first stage tramp in the business\".\n\nThe physical attributes of the Tramp include a pair of baggy pants, a tight coat, a small bowler hat, a large pair of shoes, a springy and flexible cane and the famous small mustache. The Tramp walks strangely and uncomfortably because of the ill-fitting clothing; either he is wearing secondhand clothes, or they are originally his but he cannot afford new ones. The Tramp may have seen better days, but he maintains the attitude and demeanor of a high-class individual; as long as he acts like one he can believe that he is one, and is able to keep his hope that some day he actually will be again.\n\nTwo films made in 1915, \"The Tramp\" and \"The Bank\", created the characteristics of Chaplin's screen persona. While in the end the Tramp manages to shake off his disappointment and resume his carefree ways, the pathos lies in the Tramp's having a hope for a more permanent transformation through love, and his failure to achieve this.\n\nThe Tramp was usually the victim of circumstance and coincidence, but sometimes the results worked in his favor. In \"Modern Times\", he picks up a red flag that falls off a truck and starts to wave it at the truck in an attempt to return it, and by doing so, unknowingly and inadvertently becomes the leader of a group of protesting workers, and ends up in jail because of it. While in jail he accidentally eats “nose powder” (i.e., cocaine), which causes him to not return to his jail cell; but when he eventually does, he fights off some jailbreakers attempting to escape, thus saving the life of the warden. Because of this, the warden offers to let him go, but the Tramp would rather stay in jail because it is better than the outside world.\n\nChaplin's social commentary, while critical of the faults and excesses created by industrialization, also shows support for and belief in the “American Dream.\" In \"Modern Times\", Chaplin creates a “portrayal consistent with popular leftist stereotypes of wealthy union leaders and oppressed workers in the 1930s.” While the Tramp and his fellow workers sweat on the assembly line, the president of the Electro Steel Company works on a puzzle and reads the funnies in the newspaper. The obsession of working with efficiency and assembly-line productivity ultimately drives the Tramp mad. This could be seen as “an attack on the capitalist rationalization of production.” However, “the film also guardedly affirms American middle-class, particularly its optimism.” For example, one sequence depicts the Tramp's dream in which he and the gamine live a traditional middle-class lifestyle.\n\nThe Tramp and the gamine find a rundown shack to live in. The gamine cooks a cheap breakfast, and then the Tramp is off to work, while the gamine stays to maintain the home—an allusion to a middle-class setting. By the ending of \"Modern Times\", “the film seems tailored to please the middle-class optimist.” Due to all of their failings the final scene had the gamine stating, “What's the use of trying?”, and the Tramp replying “Buck up—never say die.” In his silent films, Chaplin uniquely deployed critical social commentary. “What makes \"Modern Times\" decidedly different from Chaplin's previous three films are the political references and social realism that keep intruding into Charlie's world.” “No comedian before or after him has spent more energy depicting people in their working lives.” “Though there had been films depicting the lives of immigrants and urban workers, no filmmaker before Chaplin had created their experience so humanly and lovingly.”\n\nChaplin used not one but two similar-looking characters to the Tramp in \"The Great Dictator\" (released October 15, 1940); however, this was an all-talking film (Chaplin's first). The film was inspired by the noted similarity between Chaplin's Tramp (most notably his small mustache) and that of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Chaplin used this similarity to create a dark version of the Tramp character in parody of the dictator. (In his book \"My Autobiography\", Chaplin stated that he was unaware of the Holocaust when he made the film; if he had been, he writes, he wouldn't have been able to make a comedy satirizing Hitler). In his autobiography, Chaplin identifies the barber as the Tramp. A noticeable difference is that the barber has a streak of grey in his hair, whereas the Tramp had always been depicted as having dark hair. Also, the barber lacks the ill-fitting clothes of the Tramp, and is clearly portrayed as having a profession. His character does share much of The Tramp's character, notably his idealism and anger on seeing unfairness.\n\n\"The Tramp\" is also a short film starring Chaplin as the titular main character. In the film, a hobo exchanges the Tramp's sandwich for a brick, so the Tramp must eat grass. The same hobo later bothers a farmer's daughter, and the Tramp comes to her aid with the help of the brick. When two more hobos show up, the Tramp throws all three into a lake. The grateful girl takes the Tramp home, where he fails as a farmhand. He again helps drive off the hobos (who are now trying to break into the house). The girl's fiancé arrives. Though a hero, Charlie—knowing he must go—writes a farewell note and leaves again for the open road.\n\nThe film also stars Edna Purviance, Lloyd Bacon, and Leo White.\n\n\"The Tramp\" was released on April 11, 1915, through Essanay Studios.\n\n\n"}

He has appeared at most major jazz clubs and festival venues, and recorded under his own name for such record labels as RCA, Contemporary, Pinnacle, Blackhawk, Criss Cross, SteepleChase, Chesky, and HighNote.\n\nIn contrast to his signature recordings during the RCA/BMG years (1996–2003), where much of his focus was on projects involving large ensembles, big bands and chamber orchestras, Harrell's more recent works demonstrate his skills as a leader of a tight, smaller unit. Harrell has made four albums with the current quintet of six years, which comprises tenor saxophonist Wayne Escoffery, pianist Danny Grissett, bassist Ugonna Okegwo who has performed with Harrell since 1997, and drummer Johnathan Blake. The group is noted for the strong chemistry between the musicians and the distinctive sound achieved primarily through Harrell's compositions. Harrell's current quintet differs from previous editions of quintets he has formed and worked with, in the use of Fender Rhodes and acoustic piano. Harrell's 2012 recording, \"Number Five\", received his seventh SESAC Jazz Award.\n\nIn June 2012, Harrell debuted his nine-piece chamber ensemble at the Highline Ballroom as part of the Blue Note Jazz Festival. Harrell arranged the music of Debussy, Ravel, and his own compositions for this ensemble, which consists of trumpet, soprano and tenor saxophones, c-flute and bass flute, violin, cello, acoustic guitar, piano, bass, and drums. The Tom Harrell Chamber Ensemble has since performed at the Village Vanguard, Autumn Jazz Festival in Bielsko Biala, the Jazz Standard, the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival, the Scripps Auditorium in San Diego, and Soka University Performing Arts Center in Aliso Viejo, CA. Harrell considers the arrangements and compositions some of the most challenging works he has written to date.\n\nIn 2013, Harrell formed a piano-less sextet with two basses called \"Colors of a Dream\", which comprises himself on trumpet and flugelhorn, Wayne Escoffery on tenor saxophone, Jaleel Shaw on alto saxophone, Johnathan Blake on drums, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Esperanza Spalding doubling on bass and vocal. The group debuted at the Village Vanguard during its six-night run starting March 26, 2013 and the second night's performance was webcast for live streaming by NPR. A studio album by the same name was released on October 22, 2013 for which Harrell received his eighth SESAC Jazz Awards the following year.\n\nHarrell also recorded with TRIP, a piano-less quartet featuring saxophonist Mark Turner, bassist Ugonna Okegwo and drummer Adam Cruz in 2013. The group first performed in Rochester, New York, and at the Jazz Standard during Dave Douglas' Festival of New Trumpet Music (FONT) in October 2012. Harrell premiered the suite with six sections he wrote specifically for this group. TRIP reconvened a year later at the Village Vanguard and made a studio recording the following week. The quartet released the self-titled album \"TRIP\" on August 12, 2014.\n\nHarrell's work as composer and jazz soloist has been published in books by Hal Leonard, Jamey Aebersold, Sher Music, and Gerard and Sarzin.\n\n\nWith Art Farmer\nWith John McNeil\n\nWith Gordon Brisker\n\nWith Donald Brown\nWith Thomas Chapin\nWith Harold Danko\n\nWith Bill Evans\nWith George Gruntz\nWith Charlie Haden\nWith Lee Konitz\nWith Joe Lovano\nWith Charles McPherson\nWith Idris Muhammad\nWith Gerry Mulligan\nWith Cecil Payne\nWith Horace Silver\nWith Jim Hall\nWith Steve Swallow\nWith Phil Woods\n\n\n"}

The Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as \"a neo-Nazi white supremacist\" known for \"extremely violent rhetoric advocating genocide of non-whites\". He has identified himself using a variety of aliases to the media, although most sources correctly provide his first name as Andrew.\n\nAs a member of the hacker group Goatse Security, Auernheimer exposed a flaw in AT&T security that compromised the e-mail addresses of iPad users. In revealing the flaw to the media, the group also exposed personal data from over 100,000 people, which led to a criminal investigation and indictment for identity fraud and conspiracy. Auernheimer was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison, of which he served approximately 13 months before the conviction was vacated by a higher court.\n\nIn 2016, Auernheimer was responsible for sending thousands of white-supremacist flyers to unsecured web-connected printers at multiple universities and other locations in the U.S. Since his release from prison, he has lived in a variety of locations in Eastern Europe. In 2017, it was reported that he was acting as webmaster for the neo-Nazi website \"The Daily Stormer\".\n\nAuernheimer claimed responsibility for the reclassification of many books on gay issues as pornography on Amazon's services in April 2009. Amazon said that he was not responsible for the incident. Even before the Amazon incident, several media publications profiled him regarding his hacking and trolling activities, including \"The New York Times\", in which he claimed to be a member of a hacker group called \"the organization,\" making $10 million annually. He also claimed to be the owner of a Rolls-Royce Phantom. After the \"Times\" story on Auernheimer was published, reporters sought him out for commentary on hacking-related stories. Gawker published a story on the Sarah Palin email hacking incident and prominently featured Auernheimer's comments in the title of the story.\n\nIn 2008, Auernheimer claimed responsibility in a \"New York Times\" interview for harassing the author and game developer Kathy Sierra in response to her \"touchy\" reaction to receiving threatening comments on her blog. This included posting a false account of her career online, including charges that she was a former sex worker, along with her home address and Social Security number. The post instigated further harassment and abuse of Sierra, which led her to withdraw from online activity for several years.\n\nHe is a member of the Gay Nigger Association of America, an anti-blogging trolling group who take their name from the 1992 Danish movie \"Gayniggers from Outer Space\". Members of Goatse Security involved with the iPad hack are also members of GNAA. He was also formerly GNAA's president.\n\nAuernheimer is a member of the group of computer experts known as \"Goatse Security\" that exposed a flaw in AT&T security which allowed the e-mail addresses of iPad users to be revealed. Contrary to what it first claimed, the group revealed the security flaw to Gawker Media before AT&T had been notified, and also exposed the data of 114,000 iPad users, including those of celebrities, the government and the military. The group's actions rekindled public debate on the disclosure of security flaws. Auernheimer maintains that Goatse Security used common industry standard practices and has said that \"we tried to be the good guys\". Jennifer Granick of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has also defended the methods used by Goatse Security.\n\nThe FBI opened an investigation into the incident, which led to a criminal complaint in January 2011 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nShortly after the investigation was opened, Auernheimer's home in Arkansas was raided by the FBI and local police. The FBI search was related to its investigation of the AT&T security breach, but he was subsequently detained on state drug charges. Police allege that, during their execution of the search warrant related to the AT&T breach, they found cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, and Schedule 2 and 3 pharmaceuticals. He was released on a $3,160 bail pending state trial. After his release on bail, he broke a gag order to protest what he maintained were violations of his civil rights. In particular, he disputed the legality of the search of his house and denial of access to a public defender. He also asked for donations via PayPal, to defray legal costs.\n\nIn January 2011, all drug-related charges were dropped immediately following Auernheimer's arrest by federal authorities. The U.S. Justice Department announced that he would be charged with one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization and one count of fraud. Although his co-defendant, Daniel Spitler, was quickly released on bail, Auernheimer was initially denied bail because of his unemployment and lack of a family member to host him. He was incarcerated in the Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City before being released on $50,000 bail in late February 2011. \n\nA federal grand jury in Newark, New Jersey, indicted Auernheimer with one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computers and one count of identity theft in July 2011. In September 2011, he was freed on bail and raising money for his legal defense fund.\n\nOn November 20, 2012, Auernheimer was found guilty of one count of identity fraud and one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization.\n\nOn November 29, 2012, Auernheimer wrote an article in \"Wired\" entitled \"Forget Disclosure – Hackers Should Keep Security Holes to Themselves,\" advocating the disclosure of any zero-day exploit only to individuals who will \"use it in the interests of social justice.\"\n\nIn a January 2013 TechCrunch article, he likened his prosecution to that of Aaron Swartz, writing\n\nOn March 18, 2013, after being found guilty of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization, Auernheimer was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $73,000 in restitution. Just prior to his sentencing, he posted an \"Ask Me Anything\" thread on Reddit; comments such as \"I hope they give me the maximum, so people will rise up and storm the docks\" and \"My regret is being nice enough to give AT&T a chance to patch before dropping the dataset to Gawker. I won't nearly be as nice next time\" were cited by the prosecution the next day in court as justification for the sentence.\n\nLater in March 2013, civil rights lawyer and George Washington University Law School faculty Orin Kerr joined Auernheimer's legal team, free of charge.\n\nAuernheimer was serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood Low, a low-security federal prison in Pennsylvania, and was scheduled for release in January 2016. On July 1, 2013, his legal team filed a brief with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that his convictions should be reversed because he had not violated the relevant provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nOn April 11, 2014, the Third Circuit issued an opinion vacating Auernheimer's conviction, on the basis that the venue in New Jersey was improper. While the judges did not address the substantive question on the legality of the site access, they were skeptical of the original conviction, noting that no circumvention of passwords had occurred and that only publicly accessible information was obtained. He was released from prison on April 11, 2014.\n\nIn October 2014, Auernheimer published an article in the neo-Nazi blog \"The Daily Stormer\" in which he revealed himself to be a white nationalist. He displayed photographs of his tattoos, one in the shape of a swastika. He described his prison time as \"thousands of hours yelling the Eddas at the top of my lungs and scrawling runes on the concrete walls.\" In 2012, he told \"Gawker\" that he had Jewish ancestry, and also claimed to have converted to Mormonism. According to \"Gawker\", \"Auernheimer deploys a peculiar rhetorical strategy that he's learned to work to his advantage: he peppers his conversation with bizarre but true facts and historical references—he has an encyclopedic knowledge of ancient Greek history, world religions and contemporary U.S. anti-government extremists, among other things—then hits you with dubious details about his own life.\"\n\nAccording to \"PandoDaily\", Auernheimer was living in Lebanon as of 2014 in order to avoid prosecution in the United States. In 2016, he told an interviewer that he was living in Kharkiv, Ukraine. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, he was reported to have left Ukraine in 2017 for Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria, self-proclaimed republic in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn October 2015, Auernheimer published the names of U.S. government employees who were exposed by the Adult FriendFinder and Ashley Madison data breaches. He told CNN, \"I went straight for government employees because they seem the easiest to shame.\" \n\nHe has also been involved in the release of the undercover Planned Parenthood videos, which were under a temporary restraining order. The \"Washington Post\" quoted him as saying he did it \"For the lulz.\"\n\nIn a pair of incidents in 2016, Auernheimer sent flyers adorned with racist and anti-Semitic messages to thousands of unsecured printers across the U.S.; flyers bearing swastikas and promoting \"The Daily Stormer\" were sent to several universities. He also claimed responsibility for 50,000 flyers sent to printers across the U.S., urging the killing of black and Jewish children and praising Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in a pair of terrorist attacks in Norway in 2011. He claimed to have used a tool to scour the Internet for unsecured printers, finding over a million vulnerable devices.\n\nAn email leak by BuzzFeed News in October 2017 revealed that weev was in contact with Breitbart News personality Milo Yiannopoulos, who had asked weev for advice on an article about the alt-right. It was also revealed that Yiannopoulos had asked his editor for permission for weev to appear on his podcast, which was rejected as the editor did not want Breitbart to associate with a \"legit racist\".\n\nIn 2017, Auernheimer was reported to be working as the webmaster for \"The Daily Stormer\". Despite his neo-Nazi affiliations, Auernheimer's mother has stated that he is partly of Jewish descent.\n\nAuernheimer has referenced the neo-Nazi slogan the Fourteen Words in various computer transactions. He has explicitly discussed the topic on social media, including asking his supporters \"Do you know the 14 Words?\"\n\n\n"}
