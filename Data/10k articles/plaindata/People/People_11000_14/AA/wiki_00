The deaths resulted in a lawsuit against the Ramada and its owners. The drownings came at a time when many area hotels were being constructed without deep ends in their pools, or were renovating their pools to remove them, according to hospitality industry professionals.\n\nThe victims, twin brothers George and Vincent Chin (16) and their brother Winston (13), were from Brooklyn, New York. They were traveling with their uncle Steven Yee, who had paid for the three boys, two of their siblings, and his own three children to join him in a tour group to Boston.\n\nThe tour buses arrived at the Ramada Rolling Green Hotel in Andover just off Route 133 at around 9:30 PM. Yee took a shower, while the boys, who did not know how to swim, went to the pool. The pool had a sign posted stating that it closed at 10 PM; it also stated that no one under 14 was allowed in the pool without adult supervision. No lifeguard was on duty, and Massachusetts law does not require one at hotel pools. Nor did the pool have a fence or a ladder in the deep end. Andover town law did not require fences around indoor pools; however, Ramada corporate standards did, the Chin family alleged that state law also required it. Their cousin began video-taping them as they played in the pool. The water was nine feet deep in the deep end.\n\nAccording to police, at one point Vincent and Winston began moving toward the deep end, until the water was above their heads; their siblings thought they were just playing, but when they did not emerge, their siblings began yelling for help and threw them a life preserver. George dived into the pool in a rescue attempt, while his cousin went into the hotel to try to find someone to help. A pool maintenance man would later testify that he saw them playing in the pool but did not mention this fact to co-workers or managers. At the time, the night manager and another employee were on the way to the pool to close it, but stopped to chat with the pool maintenance man, delaying their arrival. By the time they came to the pool, they found the boys already submerged. The night manager jumped into the pool and pulled them out. However, the employees lacked aquatic rescue skills and could not render further assistance.\n\nVincent was taken to Lawrence General Hospital in the neighboring town of Lawrence, while Winston was taken to St. John's Hospital (now Saints Medical Center) in Lowell; both were declared dead on arrival. George was still alive when removed from the pool, and was taken by helicopter to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where he was pronounced dead at 6:18 AM the following morning. The parents flew to Boston that day to identify the bodies and arrange their return to New York.\n\nAbout 500 mourners attended the boys' funeral, which was held on 13 April at the Wah Wing Sang Buddhist funeral home. Mayor David Dinkins spoke briefly. The Brooklyn Chinatown branches of the Lions Club and Kiwanis, together with the Chinese-American Voters' Association, started a fund to provide aid to the family, as the father was then unemployed. Ramada Rolling Green and its owners offered the Chin family a $1.8 million settlement in January 1996, which they rejected. Instead, they filed a wrongful death and negligence suit. They hoped to spark changes in Massachusetts law to require lifeguards at hotel pools, in the way that law in New York City already did. Jury selection was completed on January 29. During deliberations, one member of the jury was dismissed for reading a newspaper article about the case. The remaining members of the jury failed to reach a verdict. On February 16, presiding judge Nancy Gertner declared a mistrial.\n"}

{"id": "24859777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24859777", "title": "Amadeus Arkham", "text": "Amadeus Arkham\n\nAmadeus Arkham is a fictional character in DC Comics. He was the founder of Arkham Asylum and is the uncle of Jeremiah Arkham.\n\nHe was created in 1984 for the entry for Arkham Asylum in \"Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe\" #1. The story was retold and expanded in 1989 in \"\". The graphic novel is interspersed with flashbacks to Arkham founder Amadeus Arkham's life and childhood. The character recently appeared in DC's The New 52 as a protagonist of \"All Star Western\" alongside Jonah Hex.\n\nThe \"Who's Who\" entry establishes that the Asylum was named after Elizabeth Arkham, the mother of founder Amadeus Arkham. The original name of the asylum was Arkham Hospital. Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham's mother, having suffered from mental illness most of her life, committed suicide (it was later revealed that her son actually euthanized her and repressed the memory). Amadeus Arkham decided, then, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not suffer as his mother had. Prior to the period of the hospital's remodeling, Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in Metropolis, where he, his wife Constance and daughter Harriet had been living for quite some time.\n\nUpon telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Arkham received a call from the police notifying him that serial killer Martin \"Mad Dog\" Hawkins — referred to Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital — had escaped from prison, and sought his considered opinion on the murderer's state of mind. Shortly afterward, Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the raped and mutilated bodies of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room with Hawkins' nickname carved on Harriet's body.\n\nThe shock of the murders brings back the memory of killing his mother. For many years, Elizabeth suffered delusions that she was being tormented by a supernatural creature and would call to her son to protect her. One day, however, he finally sees what his mother saw - a great bat, a spectre of death. Taking a pearl-handled straight razor from his pocket, he cuts his mother's throat to end her suffering. He then blocks out the memory and attributes her death to suicide.\n\nTraumatized, Amadeus puts on his mother's wedding dress and takes out the pearl-handled razor. It is vaguely implied that Arkham cannibalizes his family's remains in a shamanic ritual. Kneeling in the blood of his family, he vows to bind the evil spirit of \"The Bat,\" which he believes inhabits the house, through ritual and sorcery. He treats Hawkins for months until finally electrocuting him in a shock therapy session. This incident is treated as an accident by the authorities. Soon after, Arkham freefalls into madness. He continues his mission even after he is incarcerated in the Asylum himself after trying to kill his stockbroker in 1929; he scratches the words of a binding spell into the walls and floor of his cell with his fingernails and constantly belts out \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in a loud voice until the day he dies.\nDecades later Dr. Cavendish, another doctor in the asylum, believes he is a reincarnation of Amadeus and frees the inmates. Towards the end of the story, he takes another doctor, Dr. Adams, hostage, dresses himself in the dress of Amadeus' mother and relates Arkham's history to Batman before attempting to strangle him. Dr. Adams saves Batman by killing Cavendish with the same razor Amadeus used to kill his mother.\n\nAmadeus' role in creating the asylum, Mad Dog's history with Amadeus and Amadeus' murder of Mad Dog and descent into madness have become canon and are the origin of Arkham Asylum in all incarnations of the asylum since.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Amadeus Arkham is re-established as having been the partner of the bounty hunter Jonah Hex. Amadeus was a psychologist who specializes in criminal behavior and lived in a mansion with his mother. Amadeus often partners up with Jonah Hex in an effort to solve a series of murders that were committed by the Gotham Ripper and even uncovered a child slavery operation run by Thurston Moody of the Court of Owls.\n\n\n"}

At the age of 11, he was adopted by firearms craftsman Arisaka Nagayoshi, from whom he took his family name. After the Meiji Restoration, he enlisted in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. In 1891, he caught the attention of General Murata Tsuneyoshi, designer of the Murata Rifle, the standard Japanese Army rifle, and was appointed to a position in the Tokyo Arsenal. \n\nIn 1897, Arisaka completed work on the Type 30 Rifle, an improvement on the Murata Rifle, which was adopted by the Japanese Army as its standard weapon in time for the Boxer Rebellion. In 1898, he also completed design work on the Type 31 75mm Mountain Gun, and his name became known in the world of artillery as well as small arms. However, his earlier designs were not well received by combat troops. The Type 30 Rifle was regarded as underpowered and lacked lethality. The Type 31 guns lacked recoil buffers and had poor accuracy. \n\nIn 1903, Arisaka was appointed head of the Army Technical Bureau. He oversaw a committee charged with improving older models, including the Type 30 Rifle. The chief designer on the project was Captain Nambu Kijirō, who would later attain fame as a weapons designer on his own. The result of this project was the famous Type 38 Rifle, otherwise known as the “Arisaka Rifle”, which was issued to front line infantry troops just in time for the end of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. The ruggedness of the Type 38 rifle was praised by combat troops, although the issue of its small caliber was not addressed until much later. The Type 38 Rifle, and its various modified versions, continued to be used by the Japanese military until the end of World War II.\n\nThroughout the Russo-Japanese War, Arisaka continued to work on improvements and variations to his rifles, and at the request of Chief of the General Staff Yamagata Aritomo, he also worked on designs for large caliber siege weapons and fortress guns. In 1906, Arisaka was awarded with the Order of the Golden Kite (2nd Class) and promoted to lieutenant general. In 1907, he was further elevated to the \"kazoku\" peerage when he was made a baron (\"danshaku\"). In 1910, he was awarded with the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class).\n\nArisaka died in 1915, and his grave is at the Yanaka Cemetery in Tokyo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11619411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11619411", "title": "Bahira", "text": "Bahira\n\nBahira (, ), or Sergius the Monk to the Latin West, was an Arab Arian, Nestorian or possibly Gnostic Nasorean monk who, according to Islamic tradition, foretold to the adolescent Muhammad his future as a prophet. His name derives from the Syriac \"bḥīrā\", meaning “tested (by God) and approved”.\n\nThe story of Muhammad's encounter with Bahira occurs in the works of the early Muslim historians Ibn Hisham (died 833 CE), Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi (784-855), and Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (839-923), whose versions differ in some details. The young Muhammad, then either nine or twelve years old, met Bahira in the town of Bosra in Syria while travelling with a Meccan caravan, accompanying his uncle Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. When the caravan passed by his cell, the monk invited the merchants to a feast. They accepted the invitation, leaving the boy to guard the camel. Bahira, however, insisted that everyone in the caravan should come to him. Then a miraculous occurrence indicated to the monk that Muhammad would become a prophet.\n\nThe movement of a cloud that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day drew Bahira's attention. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's uncle (Abu Talib), warning him to preserve the child from the Jews (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the Byzantines (in al-Tabari's version). Both Ibn Sa'd and al-Tabari write that Bahira found the announcement of the coming of Muhammad in the original, unadulterated gospels, which he possessed.\n\nA similar tradition is attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the works of the early ahadith compiler ‘Abd al-Razzaq al-San‘ani, in which the unnamed figure is a rabbi of Tayma instead of a Christian Syrian monk. The rabbi warns Abu Talib against bringing Muhammad to Syria, as he predicts that Muhammad will be killed by the Syrian Jews if they proceed. Abu Talib returns back to Mecca with his nephew. Later Islamic writers gave the rabbi the name of Bahira.\n\nIn the Christian tradition Bahira became a heretical monk, whose errant views inspired the Qur'an. Bahira is at the center of the \"Apocalypse of Bahira\", which exists in Syriac and Arabic which makes the case for an origin of the Qur'an from Christian apocrypha. Certain Arabist authors maintain that Bahira's works formed the basis of those parts of the Qur'an that conform to the principles of Christianity, while the rest was introduced either by subsequent compilers such as Uthman Ibn Affan or contemporary Jews and Arabs.\nThe names and religious affiliations of the monk vary in different Christian sources. For example, John of Damascus (d.749), a Christian writer, states that Muhammad \"having chanced upon the Old and New Testaments and likewise, it seems, having conversed with an Arian monk, devised his own heresy.\"\n\nFor Abd-al-Masih al-Kindi, who calls him Sergius and writes that he later called himself Nestorius, Bahira was a Nasorean, a group usually conflated with the Nestorians. After the 9th century, Byzantine polemicists refer to him as Baeira or Pakhyras, both being derivatives of the name Bahira, and describe him as an iconoclast. Sometimes Bahira is called a Jacobite or an Arian. The early Christian polemical biographies of Muhammad share in claiming that any supposed illiteracy of Muhammad did not imply that he received religious instruction solely from the angel Gabriel, and often identified Bahira as a secret, religious teacher to Muhammad.\n\n"}

Her career has spanned nearly five decades, beginning in the 1970s as the lead vocalist of the funk band Rufus. Khan received public attention for her vocals and image. Known as the Queen of Funk, Khan was the first R&B artist to have a crossover hit featuring a rapper, with \"I Feel for You\" in 1984. Khan has won ten Grammys and has sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide.\n\nIn the course of her solo career, Khan has achieved three gold singles, three gold albums and one platinum album with \"I Feel for You\". With Rufus, she achieved four gold singles, four gold albums, and two platinum albums. She has collaborated with Ry Cooder, Robert Palmer, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Guru, and Mary J. Blige, among others. In December 2016, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked her as the 65th most successful dance artist of all time. She was ranked at number 17 in VH1's original list of the \"100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll\". She has been nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; she was first nominated as member of Rufus in 2011.\n\nChaka Khan was born Yvette Marie Stevens on March 23, 1953 into an artistic, bohemian household in Chicago, Illinois. The eldest of five children born to Charles Stevens and Sandra Coleman, she has described her father as a beatnik and her mother as \"able to do anything.\" She was raised in the Hyde Park area, \"an island in the middle of the madness\" of Chicago's rough South Side housing projects. Her sister Yvonne later became a successful musician in her own right under the name Taka Boom. Her only brother, Mark, who formed the funk group Aurra, also became a successful musician. She has two other sisters, Zaheva Stevens and Tammy McCrary.\n\nKhan was raised as a Catholic. She attributed her love of music to her grandmother, who introduced her to jazz as a child. Khan became a fan of rhythm and blues music as a preteen and at eleven formed a girl group, the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, a strong supporter of the movement, and joined the Black Panther Party after befriending fellow member, activist, and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. Though many think that she was given the name Chaka while in the Panthers she has made it clear that her name Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi was given to her at age 13 by a Yoruba Baba. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy). She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with Cash McCall's group Lyfe, which included her then-boyfriend Hassan Khan.\n\nShe was asked to replace Baby Huey of Baby Huey & the Babysitters after Huey's death in 1970. The group disbanded a year later. While performing in local bands in 1972, Khan was spotted by two members of a new group called Rufus and soon won her position in the group (replacing rock n roll singer Paulette McWilliams). They later signed with ABC Records in 1973. Prior to signing with the label, she married Khan, changing her stage name to \"Chaka Khan\".\n\nIn 1973, Rufus released their eponymous debut album. Despite their fiery rendition of Stevie Wonder's \"Maybe Your Baby\" from Wonder's acclaimed \"Talking Book\" and the modest success of the Chaka-led ballad \"Whoever's Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)\", the album failed to garner attention. That changed when Wonder himself collaborated with the group on a song he had written for Khan. That song, \"Tell Me Something Good\", became the group's breakthrough hit, reaching number-three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1974, later winning the group their first Grammy Award. The single's success and the subsequent follow-up, \"You Got the Love\", which peaked at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, helped their second parent album, \"Rags to Rufus\", go platinum, selling over a million copies. From 1974 to 1979, Rufus released six platinum-selling albums including \"Rufusized\", \"Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan\", \"Ask Rufus\", \"Street Player\" and \"Masterjam\". Hits the group scored during this time included \"Once You Get Started,\" \"Sweet Thing,\" \"Hollywood,\" \"At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up),\" and \"Do You Love What You Feel.\"\n\nThe band gained a reputation as a live performing act, with Khan becoming the star attraction, thanks to her powerful vocals and stage attire—which sometimes included Native American garb and showing her midriff. Most of the band's material was written and produced by the band itself with few exceptions. Khan has also been noted for being an instrumentalist playing drums and bass; she also provided percussion during her tenure with Rufus. Most of her compositions were collaborations with guitarist Tony Maiden. Relations between Khan and the group, particularly between her and Andre Fischer, became stormy. Several members left with nearly every release. While Khan remained in the group, she signed a solo contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1978. While Khan was busy at work on solo material, Rufus released three albums without her participation including 1979's \"Numbers\", 1980's \"Party 'Til You're Broke\", and 1983's \"Seal in Red\".\n\nIn 1978, Warner Bros. Records released Khan's solo debut album, which featured the crossover disco hit, \"I'm Every Woman\", written for her by singers-songwriters Ashford & Simpson. The success of the single helped the album go platinum, selling over a million copies. Khan also featured on Quincy Jones's hit, \"Stuff Like That\", also released in 1978, which also featured Ashford & Simpson as co-writers, along with Jones and several others. Ashford & Simpson performed with Khan on the song.\n\nIn 1979, Khan reunited with Rufus to collaborate on the Jones-produced \"Masterjam\", which featured their hit \"Do You Love What You Feel\", which Khan sang with Tony Maiden. Despite her sometimes-acrimonious relationship with some of her bandmates, Khan and Maiden have maintained a friendship over the years. In 1979 she also dueted with Ry Cooder on his album \"Bop Till You Drop\". In 1980, while Rufus released \"Party 'Til You're Broke\", again without Khan, she released her second solo album, \"Naughty\", which featured her on the cover with her six-year-old daughter Milini. The album yielded the disco hit \"Clouds\" and the R&B ballad \"Papillon\".\n\nAlso in 1980, Khan had a cameo appearance as a church choir soloist in \"The Blues Brothers\" starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Khan released two albums in 1981, the Rufus release, \"Camouflage\" and the solo album \"What Cha' Gonna Do for Me\". The latter album went gold. The same year, Khan appeared on three tracks on Rick Wakeman's concept album \"1984\". In 1982, Khan issued two more solo albums, the jazz-oriented \"Echoes of an Era\" and a more funk/pop-oriented self-titled album \"Chaka Khan\". The latter album's track, the jazz-inflected \"Be Bop Medley\", won Khan a Grammy and earned praise from jazz singer Betty Carter who loved Khan's vocal scatting in the song.\n\nIn 1983, following the release of Rufus's final studio album, \"Seal in Red\", which did not feature Khan, the singer returned with Rufus on a live album, \"Stompin' at the Savoy - Live\", which featured the studio single, \"Ain't Nobody\", which became the group's final charting success reaching number 22 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B chart, while also reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom. Following this release, Rufus separated for good.\n\nIn 1984, Khan released her sixth studio album, \"I Feel for You\". The title track, the first single released, was originally written and recorded by Prince in 1979 and had also been recorded by The Pointer Sisters and Rebbie Jackson. Khan's version featured a harmonica solo by Stevie Wonder and an introductory rap by Grandmaster Melle Mel. It became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and United Kingdom and helped to relaunch Khan's career. \"I Feel for You\" topped not only the U.S. R&B and dance charts, but achieved great success on the U.S. pop chart and reached No. 1 in the U.K. The song reached No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in December 1984 and remained on that chart for 26 weeks, well into 1985. Additionally, it hit No. 1 on the Cash Box chart. It was listed as \"Billboard\"′s No. 5 song for 1985 and netted Prince the 1985 Grammy Award for Best R&B Song. In addition to the song's successful radio airplay and sales, a music video of Khan with breakdancers in an inner-city setting enjoyed heavy rotation on television and helped to solidify Khan's notoriety in popular culture.\n\nOther singles that helped the \"I Feel For You\" album go platinum included \"This is My Night\" and the ballad \"Through the Fire\", the latter of which was also successful on the adult contemporary chart. Khan was featured in Steve Winwood's 1986 number-one hit, \"Higher Love\". That same year, a duet was planned with Robert Palmer for the song \"Addicted To Love\". However, her manager declined to release the duet, citing the desire to not have too much product from her in the marketplace at one time. She was still credited for the vocal arrangements in the album's liner notes, and the song became an international hit. Khan followed up the success of the \"I Feel For You\" album with 1986's \"Destiny\" and 1988's \"CK\". Khan found more success in the late 1980s with a remix album, \"\", which reached the top ten on the British albums chart. As a result, she performed regularly in the U.K., where she maintained a strong fan base.\n\nIn 1990, she was a featured performer on another major hit when she collaborated with Ray Charles and Quincy Jones on a new jack swing cover of The Brothers Johnson's \"I'll Be Good to You\", which was featured on Jones's \"Back on the Block\". The song reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&B chart, later winning her and Ray Charles a Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance By a Duo or Group. Khan returned with her first studio album in four years in 1992 with the release of \"The Woman I Am\", which was a success due to the R&B songs \"Love You All My Lifetime\" and \"You Can Make the Story Right\".\n\nKhan also contributed to soundtracks and worked on a follow-up to \"The Woman I Am\" she titled \"Dare You to Love Me\", which was eventually shelved. In 1995, she and rapper Guru had a hit with the duet \"Watch What You Say\", in the U.K. That same year, she provided a contemporary R&B cover of the classic standard, \"My Funny Valentine\", for the \"Waiting to Exhale\" soundtrack. In 1996, following the release of her greatest-hits album, \"\", Khan abruptly left Warner Bros. after stating the label had neglected her and failed to release \"Dare You to Love Me\".\n\nIn 1998, Khan signed a contract with Prince's NPG Records label and issued \"Come 2 My House\", followed by the single \"Don't Talk 2 Strangers\", a cover of a 1996 Prince song. She later went on a tour with Prince as a co-headlining act. In 2000, Khan departed NPG and in 2004 released her first jazz covers album in twenty-two years with 2004's \"ClassiKhan\". She also covered \"Little Wing\" with Kenny Olson on the album \"\". Three years later, after signing with Burgundy Records, Khan released what many critics called a \"comeback album\" with \"Funk This\", produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis & Big Jim Wright. The album featured the hit, \"Angel\", and the Mary J. Blige duet, \"Disrespectful\". The latter track went to number one on the U.S. dance singles chart, winning the singers a Grammy Award, while \"Funk This\" also won a Grammy for Best R&B Album. The album was also notable for Khan's covers of Dee Dee Warwick's \"Foolish Fool\" and Prince's \"Sign o' the Times\". In 2008, Khan participated in the Broadway adaptation of \"The Color Purple\" playing Ms. Sofia to Fantasia Barrino's Celie.\n\nIn December 2004, Chaka Khan was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music during the inauguration of its president, Roger H. Brown.\n\nIn a 2008 interview Khan said that she, unlike other artists, felt very optimistic about the current changes in the recording industry, including music downloading. \"I'm glad things are shifting and artists – not labels – are having more control over their art. My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven't seen the light of day that people need to hear. This includes Robert Palmer's original recording of 'Addicted to Love' – which they took my vocals off of! We are working on getting it (and other tracks) all back now.\" In 2009, Khan hit the road with singers Anastacia and Lulu for Here Come the Girls.\n\nIn 2009, Chaka was guest singer with the song \"Alive\" on jazz drummer Billy Cobham's album \"Drum ' n voice 3\". In 2010, she contributed to vocals for Beverley Knight's \"Soul Survivor\", collaborated with Clay Aiken on a song for the kids show \"Phineas and Ferb\", and performed two songs with Japanese singer Ai on Ai's latest album \"The Last Ai\". Khan continues to perform to packed audiences both in her native United States and overseas.\n\nOn May 19, 2011, Khan was given the 2,440th Hollywood Walk of Fame star plaque on a section of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her family was present when the singer accepted the honor, as was Stevie Wonder, who had written her breakout hit \"Tell Me Something Good\". On September 27, 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame committee announced that Khan and her former band Rufus were jointly nominated for induction to the hall. It was the collective's first nomination 13 years after they were first eligible. The group were nominated partly due to Khan's own storied reputation, including her own solo career in conjunction with her years with Rufus. Recently, Khan rerecorded her song, \"Super Life\", under the title \"Super Life: Fear Kills, Love Heals\" with Eric Benet, Kelly Price, and Luke James in tribute to Trayvon Martin, a teenager who was killed on February 26. A number of celebrities also joined in the recording including Loretta Devine, Terry Crews, Eva Pigford, and reporter Kevin Frazier.\n\nOn December 6, 2012, Chaka Khan made a controversial decision to perform at a benefit for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF originally invited Stevie Wonder, however after a successful lobbying campaign by the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, Wonder withdrew and was replaced by Khan who was able to raise $14 million for the IDF. This support contrasted with her earlier support for the Black Panther Party that publicly supported a Free Palestine.\n\nOn July 27, 2013, Khan was honored 40 years after signing her first recording contract with a ceremonial renaming of Blackstone Avenue between 50th and 51st street (where her former high school, Kenwood Academy, sits) as Chaka Khan Way and on July 28 the city declared the day Chaka Khan Day. She performed at Millennium Park's Pritzker Pavilion on the 28th. In August 2014, Khan served as grand marshal at the 85th annual Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic in her hometown of Chicago.\n\nOn August 27, 2015, Khan was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 21 of \"Dancing with the Stars\". She was paired with professional dancer Keo Motsepe. Khan and Motsepe were the first couple eliminated from the competition on September 21, 2015.\n\nIn July 2016, she canceled concert performances and entered rehab.\n\nIn June 2018 she released a new single called \"Like Sugar\", a collaboration with Major Lazer member Switch. An album featuring the song is expected to be released later this year.\n\nKhan will serve as Grand Marshal in the 2019 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 2019 in Pasadena, California.\n\nKhan has been married twice and is the mother of two, daughter Indira Milini and son Damien Holland. Her first marriage was to Hassan Khan, in 1970, when she was 17, which ended in divorce a short time later. Milini's birth was the result of a relationship between Khan and Rahsaan Morris. Khan married her second husband, Richard Holland, in 1976. The marriage reportedly caused a rift between Khan and several members of Rufus, in particular, Andre Fischer. Holland wanted her to tone down her sexy stage image, but she refused. He filed for divorce in 1980, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" Khan dated a Chicago-area schoolteacher in the mid-1980s in the middle of her solo stardom. Following their separation, Khan moved to Europe, first settling in London, later buying a residence in Germany. She lived in Germany for a while \"in a little village in the Rhine Valley\" and also in Mannheim.\n\nKhan is vegan, saying she adopted the diet to lose weight and combat high blood pressure and Type-2 diabetes. In the past, Khan struggled with drug abuse and alcoholism. Her drug use, which at times included cocaine and heroin, ended in the early 1990s. Khan had an on-and-off struggle with alcoholism until 2005 declaring herself sober. In 2006, her son Damien Holland was accused of murder after 17-year-old Christopher Bailey was shot to death. Khan testified on her son's behalf. Holland claimed the shooting was an accident and was found not guilty. Though she sang at both the 2000 Democratic and Republican conventions, Khan says that she is more of a \"Democratic-minded person\".\n\nIn December 2011, she won permanent custody of her granddaughter by son Damien Holland, Daija Jade Holland, after reporting that Daija's mother, Holland's girlfriend, was unable to raise her due to her drug addiction.\n\nKhan was featured in a 2013 episode of \"Celebrity Ghost Stories\" where she told the story of a shadow man who followed her on tour for years, until she met a guardian angel who admonished her to change her life or die.\n\nTo date, Khan has won 10 Grammy Awards, including two as a member of Rufus. She has received 22 Grammy Award nominations, including three as a member of Rufus.\n\n\nTo date, she has had four American Music Award nominations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She described her experiences living in Germany during the Second World War in two books: \"The Past is Myself\" (1968) and \"The Road Ahead\". She was educated at St Margaret's School, Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n\nChristabel Mary Burton was born in Totteridge, Hertfordshire to Anglo-Irish parents. Her mother, Christabel Harmsworth, was the sister of Lords Northcliffe, Harmsworth, and Rothermere. Christabel Mary won a scholarship to Oxford, but decided instead to study music in Germany. While there she met Peter Bielenberg (1911–2001), two years her junior, who was studying law with a view to joining his father's practice in Hamburg. \n\nThey married in 1934 and she took German citizenship, which required her to relinquish her British citizenship. The Bielenbergs lived initially in Hamburg, then moved to Berlin and had three sons, Nicholas, Christopher, and John. The heavy Allied bombing raids led Mrs Bielenberg and her children to leave the city, and they eventually settled in the village of Rohrbach, near Furtwangen im Schwarzwald, in the Black Forest.\n\nBoth Christabel and Peter Bielenberg were opposed to Nazism and following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, participated in anti-Nazi activities. Peter Bielenberg was a close friend of Adam von Trott zu Solz, who was involved in the Stauffenberg bomb plot against Hitler of 1944, and as a result of his suspect political views and this close association he was arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned in Ravensbrück concentration camp following the failure of the plot. In an effort to secure his release, Christabel Bielenberg asked to be interviewed by the Gestapo in order to convince them of her and her husband's political naivety and innocence. She was successful and he was released to a punishment unit but mistakenly allowed leave before joining it. He managed to slip away and remained in hiding near his family until the fighting ended.\n\nAfter the war, she returned to Britain with her children, later visiting Germany as a foreign correspondent for \"The Observer\". In 1948, the family settled in Tullow, County Carlow, Ireland, buying a dilapidated farm called \"Munny House\", which they transformed into a commercial success. As well as writing her autobiography she became involved with the Irish Peace Marches of the 1970s and lectured in Germany. She was made a Commander of the German Federal Order of Merit and was also awarded a Gold Medal of Merit by the European Parliament.\n\nHer experiences during the Second World War were made into the BBC television drama serial \"Christabel\" (1988), adapted from her memoir by Dennis Potter. Elizabeth Hurley starred in the title role. In 1974 Christabel described her experiences of attempting to shelter Jews hiding from persecution in the television series \"The World at War\".\n\nChristabel Bielenberg sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill for a portrait in clay. The correspondence file relating to the Bielenberg bust is held in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation's Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the terracotta remains in the collection of the artist.\n\nShe had three sons, Nicholas, John and Christopher (\"Kim\"). Nick's son Andy is a historian at University College Cork; Nick's son Kim works as a journalist in Dublin. Nicholas's wife was Charlotte, daughter of Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg.\n\n"}

{"id": "31912046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31912046", "title": "Egyptians", "text": "Egyptians\n\nEgyptians (  ; \"\"; ; \"Ni/rem/en/kīmi\") are an ethnic group native to Egypt and the citizens of that country sharing a common culture and a common dialect known as Egyptian Arabic.\n\nEgyptian identity is closely tied to geography. The population of Egypt is concentrated in the lower Nile Valley, the small strip of cultivable land stretching from the First Cataract to the Mediterranean and enclosed by desert both to the east and to the west. This unique geography has been the basis of the development of Egyptian society since antiquity.\n\nThe daily language of the Egyptians is the local variety of Arabic, known as Egyptian Arabic or \"Masri. \"Additionally, a sizable minority of Egyptians living in Upper Egypt speak Sa'idi Arabic. Egyptians are predominantly adherents of Sunni Islam with a Shia minority and a significant proportion who follow native Sufi orders. A considerable percentage of Egyptians belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, whose liturgical language, Coptic, is the most recent stage of the indigenous Egyptian language and is still used in prayers along with Arabic.\n\nEgyptians receive or have received several names:\n\nThere are an estimated 92.1 million Egyptians. Most are native to Egypt, where Egyptians constitute around 91% of the population.\n\nApproximately 84–90% of the population of Egypt are Muslim adherents and 10–15% are Christian adherents (10–15% Coptic, 1% other Christian) according to estimates. The majority live near the banks of the Nile River where the only arable land is found. Close to half of the Egyptian people today are urban; most of the rest are fellahin that are native, along with descendants of several Arab tribes living in rural towns and villages. A large influx of fellahin into urban cities, and rapid urbanization of many rural areas since the early 20th century, have shifted the balance between the number of urban and rural citizens. Egyptians also form smaller minorities in neighboring countries, North America, Europe and Australia.\n\nEgyptians also tend to be provincial, meaning their attachment extends not only to Egypt but to the specific provinces, towns and villages from which they hail. Therefore, return migrants, such as temporary workers abroad, come back to their region of origin in Egypt. According to the International Organization for Migration, an estimated 2.7 million Egyptians live abroad and contribute actively to the development of their country through remittances (US$7.8 billion in 2009), circulation of human and social capital, as well as investment. Approximately 70% of Egyptian migrants live in Arab countries (923,600 in Saudi Arabia, 332,600 in Libya, 226,850 in Jordan, 190,550 in Kuwait with the rest elsewhere in the region) and the remaining 30% are living mostly in Europe and North America (318,000 in the United States, 110,000 in Canada and 90,000 in Italy).\n\nA sizable Egyptian diaspora did not begin to form until well into the 1980s, when political and economic conditions began driving Egyptians out of the country in significant numbers. Today, the diaspora numbers nearly 4 million (2006 est). Generally, those who emigrate to the United States and western European countries tend to do so permanently, with 93% and 55.5% of Egyptians (respectively) settling in the new country. On the other hand, Egyptians migrating to Arab countries almost always only go there with the intention of returning to Egypt; virtually none settle in the new country on a permanent basis.\n\nPrior to 1974, only few Egyptian professionals had left the country in search for employment. Political, demographic and economic pressures led to the first wave of emigration after 1952. Later more Egyptians left their homeland first after the 1973 boom in oil prices and again in 1979, but it was only in the second half of the 1980s that Egyptian migration became prominent.\n\nEgyptian emigration today is motivated by even higher rates of unemployment, population growth and increasing prices. Political repression and human rights violations by Egypt's ruling régime are other contributing factors (see ). Egyptians have also been impacted by the wars between Egypt and Israel, particularly after the Six-Day War in 1967, when migration rates began to rise. In August 2006, Egyptians made headlines when 11 students from Mansoura University failed to show up at their American host institutions for a cultural exchange program in the hope of finding employment.\n\nEgyptians in neighboring countries face additional challenges. Over the years, abuse, exploitation and/or ill-treatment of Egyptian workers and professionals in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Iraq and Libya have been reported by the Egyptian Human Rights Organization and different media outlets. Arab nationals have in the past expressed fear over an \"'Egyptianization' of the local dialects and culture that were believed to have resulted from the predominance of Egyptians in the field of education\" (see also Egyptian Arabic – Geographics).\n\nThe Egyptians for their part object to what they call the \"\" of their culture due to Saudi Arabian petrodollar-flush investment in the Egyptian entertainment industry. Twice Libya was on the brink of war with Egypt due to mistreatment of Egyptian workers and after the signing of the peace treaty with Israel. When the Gulf War ended, Egyptian workers in Iraq were subjected to harsh measures and expulsion by the Iraqi government and to violent attacks by Iraqis returning from the war to fill the workforce.\n\nThe degree to which Egyptians identify with each layer of Egypt's history in articulating a sense of collective identity can vary. Questions of identity came to fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as \"Pharaonism\"). After Egyptians gained their independence from Great Britain, other forms of nationalism developed, including secular Arab nationalism as well as Islamism.\n\n\"Pharaonism\" rose to political prominence in the 1920s and 1930s during the British occupation, as Egypt developed separately from the Arab world. A segment of the most Westernized upper class argued that Egypt was part of a Mediterranean civilization. This ideology largely developed out of the country's lengthy pre-Islamic pre-Arab history, the relative isolation of the Nile Valley and the mostly homogeneous indigenous non-Arab genetic ancestry/ethnicity of the inhabitants, regardless of current religious identity. One of Pharaonism's most notable advocates was Taha Hussein who remarked \"Pharaonism is deeply rooted in the spirits of the Egyptians. It will remain so, and it must continue and become stronger. The Egyptian is Pharaonic before being Arab.\"\n\nPharaonism became the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists of the pre-war and inter-war periods. In 1931, following a visit to Egypt, Syrian Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri remarked that \"[Egyptians] did not possess an Arab nationalist sentiment; did not accept that Egypt was a part of the Arab lands, and would not acknowledge that the Egyptian people were part of the Arab nation.\" The later 1930s would become a formative period for Arab nationalism in Egypt, in large part due to efforts by Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese intellectuals.\n\nArab-Islamic political sentiment was fueled by the solidarity felt between Egyptians struggling for independence from Britain and those across the Arab world engaged in similar anti-imperialist struggles. In particular, the growth of Zionism in neighboring Palestine was seen as a threat by many Egyptians and the cause of resistance there was adopted by rising Islamic movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood as well as the political leadership including King Faruq I and Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas. Nevertheless, a year after the establishment of the League of Arab States in 1945, to be headquartered in Cairo, Oxford University historian H. S. Deighton was still writing:\n\nIt was not until the Nasser era more than a decade later that Arab nationalism, and by extension Arab socialism, became a state policy and a means with which to define Egypt's position in the Middle East and the world, usually articulated vis-à-vis Zionism in the neighboring new state of Israel. Nasser's politics was shaped by his conviction that all the Arab states were contending with anti-imperialist struggles and thus solidarity between them was imperative for independence. He viewed the earlier Egyptian nationalism of Saad Zaghlul as too inward-looking and saw no conflict between Egyptian patriotism (\"wataniyya\") and Arab nationalism (\"qawmiyya\").\n\nFor a while Egypt and Syria formed the United Arab Republic (UAR). When the union was dissolved, Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971, when Egypt adopted the current official name, the Arab Republic of Egypt. The Egyptians' attachment to Arabism was particularly questioned after the 1967 Six-Day War. Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives, and the country became disillusioned with Arab politics. Although the Arabism instilled in the country by Nasser was not deeply embedded in society, a certain kinship with the rest of the Arab world was firmly established and Egypt saw itself as the leader of this larger cultural entity. Nasser's version of pan-Arabism stressed Egyptian sovereignty and leadership of Arab unity instead of the eastern Arab states.\n\nNasser's successor Anwar el-Sadat, both through public policy and his peace initiative with Israel, revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. According to Dawisha, the terms \"Arab\", \"Arabism\" and \"Arab unity\", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent. (See also Liberal age and Republic sections.) However, despite Sadat's systematic attempts to root out Arab sentiment, Arab nationalism in Egypt remained a potent force.\n\nDuring this era, in 1978, Egyptian-American sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim studied the national discourse between 17 Egyptian intellectuals relating to Egypt's identity and peace with Israel. He noted that in 18 articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality in the conflict opposed, while in eight articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality supported and only in three articles written by author Louis Awad was Arab identity rejected and neutrality supported. Egyptian scholar Gamal Hamdan stressed that Egyptian identity was unique, but that Egypt was the center and \"cultural hub\" of the Arab world, arguing that \"Egypt in the Arab world is like Cairo in Egypt.\" Hamdan further contended \"We do not see the Egyptian personality, no matter how distinct it may be, as anything other than a part of the personality of the greater Arab homeland.\"\n\nMany Egyptians today feel that Egyptian and Arab identities are inextricably linked, and emphasize the central role that Egypt plays in the Arab world. Others continue to believe that Egypt and Egyptians are simply not Arab, emphasizing indigenous Egyptian heritage, culture and independent polity, pointing to the perceived failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies. Egyptian anthropologist Laila el-Hamamsy illustrates the modern-day relationship between the two trends, stating: \"in light of their history, Egyptians ... should be conscious of their national identity and consider themselves, above all, Egyptians. How is the Egyptian, with this strong sense of Egyptian identity, able to look himself as an Arab too?\" Her explanation is that Egyptianization translated as Arabization with the result being \"an increased tempo of Arabization, for facility in the Arabic language opened the windows into the rich legacy of Arabic culture. ... Thus in seeking a cultural identity, Egypt has revived its Arab cultural heritage.\"\n\nEgyptian critics of Arab nationalism contend that it has worked to erode and/or relegate native Egyptian identity by superimposing only one aspect of Egypt's culture. These views and sources for collective identification in the Egyptian state are captured in the words of a linguistic anthropologist who conducted fieldwork in Cairo:\n\nIn the Early Dynastic Period, Egyptians spoke the Archaic Egyptian language. In antiquity, Egyptians spoke the Egyptian language. It constitutes its own branch of the Afroasiatic family. The Coptic language is the direct descendant of the Egyptian language, written in Coptic alphabet.\n\nArabic was adopted by the rulers of Egypt after the Arab invasion and gradually came to replace Coptic as the spoken language. Spoken Coptic was mostly extinct by the 17th century but may have survived in isolated pockets in Upper Egypt as late as the 19th century.\n\nThe official language of Egypt today is Arabic. The spoken vernacular is known as Egyptian Arabic, while Modern Standard Arabic is reserved for more formal contexts as is the case in all Arab countries.\n\nThe recorded history of Egyptian Arabic as a separate dialect begins in Ottoman Egypt with a document by a 17th-century author writing about the peculiarities of the speech of the Egyptian people. This suggests that the language by then was spoken by the majority of Egyptians. It is represented in a body of vernacular literature comprising novels, plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Classical Arabic is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture, as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated.\n\nWhile a huge majority of the Egyptian Arabic dialect is derived from the formal Arabic language, it has also been highly influenced by many other languages such as French, Turkish and the old Egyptian language. This is widely thought to be the effects of being the victim of several invasions, including that of the Ottoman Empire as well as the French invasion. As each nation came and went, the Egyptians kept the few words and phrases that made the language seem easier.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the Egyptian dialect is the most understood version of the Arabic language amongst the Arab world. This is because Egyptian movies have been the most influential in the Arabic movie industry and is therefore the most widespread. As a result, most Arabic countries have grown up listening to the dialect and therefore have no trouble understanding it, even though they actually speak their own.\n\nOriginally the Egyptians wrote in hieroglyphics. At first the meaning of the hieroglyphics was unknown; until one day in the year 1799 Napoleón Bonaparte's soldiers dug up the Rosetta stone. The Rosetta Stone was found broken and incomplete. It features 14 lines of hieroglyphic script, 32 lines in Demotic and 53 lines of Ancient Greek.\n\nAncient Egypt saw a succession of thirty dynasties spanning three millennia. During this period, Egyptian culture underwent significant development in terms of religion, arts, language and customs.\n\nEgypt fell under Hyksos rule in the Middle Bronze Age. The native nobility managed to expel the conquerors by the Late Bronze Age, thereby initiating the New Kingdom. During this period, the Egyptian civilization rose to the status of an empire under Pharaoh Thutmose III of the 18th dynasty. It remained a super-regional power throughout the Amarna Period as well as during the 19th and 20th dynasties (the Ramesside Period), lasting into the Early Iron Age.\n\nThe Bronze Age collapse that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay, and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined, falling into the comparative obscurity of the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt. The 25th dynasty of Nubian rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC, and in 525 BC, Egypt fell under Persian rule.\n\nAlexander the Great was greeted as a liberator when he conquered Egypt in 332 BC. The Late Period of ancient Egypt is taken to end with his death in 323 BC. The Ptolemaic dynasty ruled Egypt from 305 BC to 30 BC and introduced Hellenic culture to Egyptians. 4,000 Celtic mercenaries under Ptolemy II had even attempted an ambitious but doomed coup d'état around the year 270 BC.\n\nThroughout the Pharaonic epoch (viz., from 2920 BC to 525 BC in conventional Egyptian chronology), divine kingship was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.\n\nThe role of the king was considerably weakened after the 20th dynasty. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain Ma'at, the principle of truth, justice and order, and to enhance the country's agricultural economy by ensuring regular Nile floods. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father Osiris. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.\n\nThe attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of ancient Egyptian society. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the Great Pyramids. The ancient Egyptian word for tomb \" means 'House of Eternity.' The Egyptians also celebrated life, as is shown by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.\nAnother important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners—those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of \"rmṯ\" or \"the people\" (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians' more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom, when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed Nubia through Jebel Barkal and parts of the Levant.\n\nThe Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of \"Ta-Meri\" (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat—a view most clearly expressed by the admonitions of Ipuwer in reaction to the chaotic events of the Second Intermediate Period. Foreigners in Egyptian texts were described in derogatory terms, e.g., 'wretched Asiatics' (Semites), 'vile Kushites' (Nubians), and 'Ionian dogs' (Greeks). Egyptian beliefs remained unchallenged when Egypt fell to the Hyksos, Assyrians, Libyans, Persians and Greeks—their rulers assumed the role of the Egyptian Pharaoh and were often depicted praying to Egyptian gods.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. The calendar revolved around the annual Nile Inundation (\"akh.t\"), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian \"fellahin\" calculate the agricultural seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner.\n\nThe importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation were the basis of Egypt's formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god Hapy and dedicated a \"Hymn to the Nile\" to celebrate it. \"km.t\", the Black Land, was as Herodotus observed, \"the gift of the river.\"\n\nWhen Alexander died, a story began to circulate that Nectanebo II was Alexander's father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs. The new Ptolemaic rulers, however, exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created between Egyptians and Greeks. The local priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the Dynastic age. Egyptians continued to practice their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors. The language of administration became Greek, but the mass of the Egyptian population was Egyptian-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.\n\nThe Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period's vernacular literature was composed in the demotic phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by great native pharaohs such as Ramesses II. Prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks, and frequent revolts by the Egyptians took place throughout the Ptolemaic period. A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about to fill a spiritual void as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and weary due to successive waves of foreign invasions.\n\nWhen the Romans annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, but Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, Greeks and Jews occupied the middle stratum, while Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, were at the bottom. Egyptians paid a poll tax at full rate, Greeks paid at half-rate and Roman citizens were exempt.\n\nThe Roman emperor Caracalla advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying \"genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech.\" This attitude lasted until AD 212 when Roman citizenship was finally granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched. The Romans, like the Ptolemies, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite. The Egyptian peasants, pressed for maximum production to meet Roman quotas, suffered and fled to the desert.\n\nThe cult of Isis, like those of Osiris and Serapis, had been popular in Egypt and throughout the Roman Empire at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years. The main temple of Isis remained a major center of worship in Egypt until the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in the 6th century, when it was finally closed down. Egyptians, disaffected and weary after a series of foreign occupations, identified the story of the mother-goddess Isis protecting her child Horus with that of the Virgin Mary and her son Jesus escaping the emperor Herod.\n\nConsequently, many sites believed to have been the resting places of the holy family during their sojourn in Egypt became sacred to the Egyptians. The visit of the holy family later circulated among Egyptian Christians as fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt\" (Hosea 11:1). The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition. According to tradition, Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the early 40s of the 1st century, under the reign of the Roman emperor Nero. The earliest converts were Jews residing in Alexandria, a city which had by then become a center of culture and learning in the entire Mediterranean \"oikoumene\".\nSt. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first Patriarch. Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of New Testament writings appeared in Oxyrhynchus (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of Decius. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor Diocletian persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians.\n\nThis event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or Coptic Church. It became known as the 'Era of the Martyrs' and is commemorated in the Coptic calendar in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of monasticism, for which the Egyptians, namely St. Antony, St. Bakhum, St. Shenouda and St. Amun, are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.\n\nThe Catachetical School of Alexandria was founded in the 3rd century by Pantaenus, becoming a major school of Christian learning as well as science, mathematics and the humanities. The Psalms and part of the New Testament were translated at the school from Greek to Egyptian, which had already begun to be written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of demotic characters. This stage of the Egyptian language would later come to be known as Coptic along with its alphabet. The third theologian to head the Catachetical School was a native Egyptian by the name of Origen. Origen was an outstanding theologian and one of the most influential Church Fathers. He traveled extensively to lecture in various churches around the world and has many important texts to his credit including the \"Hexapla\", an exegesis of various translations of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAt the threshold of the Byzantine period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor Theodosius I, Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of Constantinople after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptians temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.\n\nOne of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The Council of Chalcedon convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire's determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ's person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the Miaphysite doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts' upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek Melkites had both theological and national implications. As Coptologist Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians \"paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek. Coptic art developed its own national character, and the Copts stood united against the imperial power.\"\n\nBefore the Muslim conquest of Egypt, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius was able to reclaim the country after a brief Persian invasion in AD 616, and subsequently appointed Cyrus of Alexandria, a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.\n\nMeanwhile, the new religion of Islam was making headway in Arabia, culminating in the Muslim conquests that took place following Muhammad's Passing on. In AD 639, the Arab general 'Amr ibn al-'As marched into Egypt, facing off with the Byzantines in the Battle of Heliopolis that ended with the Byzantines' defeat. The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that most Egyptians did not put up heavy resistance against the Arabs.\n\nThe new Muslim rulers moved the capital to Fustat and, through the 7th century, retained the existing Byzantine administrative structure with Greek as its language. Native Egyptians filled administrative ranks and continued to worship freely so long as they paid the jizya poll tax, in addition to a land tax that all Egyptians irrespective of religion also had to pay. The authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was for the first time nationally recognized.\n\nAccording to al-Ya'qubi, repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Muslim Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the Umayyads and Abbasids. The greatest was one in which disaffected Muslim Egyptians joined their Christian compatriots around AD 830 in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the Arabs. The Egyptian Muslim historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam spoke harshly of the Abbasids—a reaction that according to Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly can be seen \"within the context of the struggle between proud native Egyptians and the central Abbasid caliphate in Iraq.\"\n\nThe form of Islam that eventually took hold in Egypt was Sunni, though very early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity. Just as Egyptians had been pioneers in early monasticism so they were in the development of the mystical form of Islam, Sufism. Various Sufi orders were founded in the 8th century and flourished until the present day. One of the earliest Egyptian Sufis was Dhul-Nun al-Misri (i.e., Dhul-Nun the Egyptian). He was born in Akhmim in AD 796 and achieved political and social leadership over the Egyptian people.\n\nDhul-Nun was regarded as the Patron Saint of the Physicians and is credited with having introduced the concept of Gnosis into Islam, as well as of being able to decipher a number of hieroglyphic characters due to his knowledge of Coptic. He was keenly interested in ancient Egyptian sciences, and claimed to have received his knowledge of alchemy from Egyptian sources.\n\nIn the years to follow the Arab occupation of Egypt, a social hierarchy was created whereby Egyptians who converted to Islam acquired the status of mawali or \"clients\" to the ruling Arab elite, while those who remained Christian, the Copts, became dhimmis. In time the power of the Arabs waned throughout the Islamic Empire so that in the 10th century, the Turkish Ikhshids were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire.\n\nEgyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the Shiite Fatimids from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the Egyptian dialect of Arabic, which was to eventually slowly supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language.\n\nAl-Azhar was founded in AD 970 in the new capital Cairo, not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the Ayyubid period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper\n\nThe Mamluks of Egypt (AD 1258–1517) as a whole were, some of the most enlightened rulers of Egypt, not only in the arts and in providing for the welfare of their subjects, but also in many other ways, such as efficient organisation of law and order and postal services, and the building of canals, roads, bridges and aqueducts. Though turbulent, often treacherous and brutal in their feuds, and politically and economically inept, the later Mameluks maintained the splendour and artistic traditions of their predecessors. The reign of Kait Bey (1468-1496) was one of high achievement in architecture, showing great refinement of taste in the building of elegant tombs, mosques and palaces. It was a period in which learning flourished.\n\nTheir rule is generally regarded as one under which Egyptians, Muslims and Copts, greatly suffered. By the 15th century most Egyptians had already been converted to Islam, while Coptic Christians were reduced to a minority. The Mamluks were mainly ethnic Circassians and Turks who had been captured as slaves then recruited into the army fighting on behalf of the Islamic empire. Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of Mohamed Ali. Historian James Jankwoski writes:\n\nEgyptians under the Ottoman Turks from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term \"atrak\" (Turks) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk Beys took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.\n\nThe only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim \"'ulama\" or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. It is also believed that during the time of Ottoman period of Egypt, native Egyptians were allowed and required to join the army for the first time since the Roman period of Egypt, particularly Copts who were civil servants at the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha.\n\nModern Egyptian history is generally believed to begin with the French expedition in Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. The French defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the Battle of the Pyramids, and soon they were able to seize control of the country.\n\nThe French occupation was short-lived, ending when British troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. The Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the French Revolution which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence.\n\nWhen Napoleon invited the Egyptian \"ulama\" to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense of nationalism and a patriotic desire for national independence from the Turks. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt's ecology, society and economy, \"Description de l'Égypte\", was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition.\n\nThe withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by Mohammed Ali, an Ottoman officer of Albanian ethnicity. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim \"ulama\" as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably cotton, rice and sugar-cane), increased industrialization, and a new educational system—the results of which are felt to this day.\n\nIn order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country's army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the Levant, Sudan and against the Wahabis in Arabia. Many Egyptians student missions were sent to Europe in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa'a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.\n\nThe period between 1860–1940 was characterized by an Egyptian \"nahda\", renaissance or rebirth. It is best known for the renewed interest in Egyptian antiquity and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt's autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.\n\nThe first Egyptian renaissance intellectual was Rifa'a el-Tahtawi. In 1831, Tahtawi undertook a career in journalism, education and translation. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral philosophy. In them he introduces his students to Enlightenment ideas such as secular authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or \"good Egyptian\"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.\n\nTahtawi was instrumental in sparking indigenous interest in Egypt's ancient heritage. He composed a number of poems in praise of Egypt and wrote two other general histories of the country. He also co-founded with his contemporary Ali Mubarak, the architect of the modern Egyptian school system, a native Egyptology school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars like Suyuti and Maqrizi, who studied ancient Egyptian history, language and antiquities. Tahtawi encouraged his compatriots to invite Europeans to come and teach the modern sciences in Egypt, drawing on the example of Pharaoh Psamtek I who had enlisted the Greeks' help in organizing the Egyptian army.\nAmong Mohammed Ali's successors, the most influential was Isma'il Pasha who became khedive in 1863. Ismail's reign witnessed the growth of the army, major education reforms, the founding of the Egyptian Museum and the Royal Opera House, the rise of an independent political press, a flourishing of the arts, and the inauguration of the Suez Canal. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt, including villages, which meant that native Egyptians came to exert increasing political and economic influence over their country. Several generations of Egyptians exposed to the ideas of constitutionalism made up the emerging intellectual and political milieu that slowly filled the ranks of the government, the army and institutions which had long been dominated by an aristocracy of Turks, Greeks, Circassians and Armenians.\n\nIsmail's massive modernization campaign, however, left Egypt indebted to European powers, leading to increased European meddling in local affairs. This led to the formation of secret groups made up of Egyptian notables, ministers, journalists and army officers organized across the country to oppose the increasing European influence.\n\nWhen the British deposed of Ismail and installed his son Tawfik, the now Egyptian-dominated army reacted violently, staging a revolt led by Minister of War Ahmed Urabi, self-styled el-Masri ('the Egyptian'), against the Khedive, the Turko-Circassian elite, and the European stronghold. The revolt was a military failure and British forces occupied Egypt in 1882. Technically, Egypt was still part of the Ottoman Empire with the Mohammed Ali family ruling the country, though now with British supervision and according to British directives. The Egyptian army was disbanded and a smaller army commanded by British officers was installed in its place.\n\nEgyptian self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.\n\nSheikh Muhammad Abduh, the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar Mufti, was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the modernist interpretations of Islam that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were Mustafa Kamil and Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one.\"\n\nEgyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 Dinshaway Incident, when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-colonial resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal \"Umma\" (the Nation, 1907) headed by Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, and the more radical, pro-Islamic \"Watani\" Party (National Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of Daqahliya in 1872. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi's reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: \"El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds.\"\n\nBoth the People and National parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until World War I, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British protectorate) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed and the People's Party. Prominent among these was Saad Zaghlul who led the new movement through the Wafd Party. Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to Malta, the Egyptian people staged their first modern revolution. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.\n\nThe Wafd Party drafted a new Constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary representative system. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded. New forces that came to prominence were the Muslim Brotherhood and the radical Young Egypt Party. In 1920, Banque Misr (Bank of Egypt) was founded by Talaat Pasha Harb as \"an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only\", which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians and helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses.\nUnder the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa'a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to Muhammad Abduh and Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, were Qasim Amin, Muhammad Husayn Haykal, Taha Hussein, Abbas el-'Akkad, Tawfiq el-Hakeem, and Salama Moussa. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, secularism, an evolutionary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society. This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a Golden Age of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country's interests center stage.\n\nWhen Egyptian novelist and Nobel Prize laureate Naguib Mahfouz died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt's golden age had died. In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as \"Mon Égypte\", Mahfouz had this to say:\n\nIncreased involvement by King Farouk in parliamentary affairs, government corruption, and the widening gap between the country's rich and poor led to the eventual toppling of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament through a \"coup d'état\" by a group of army officers in 1952. The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and later put under house arrest by Gamal Abdel Nasser, the real architect of the 1952 movement, mass protests by Egyptians erupted against the forced resignation of what became a popular symbol of the new regime.\n\nNasser assumed power as President and began a nationalization process that initially had profound effects on the socioeconomic strata of Egyptian society. According to one historian, \"Egypt had, for the first time since 343 BC, been ruled not by a Macedonian Greek, nor a Roman, nor an Arab, nor a Turk, but by an Egyptian.\"\n\nNasser nationalized the Suez Canal leading to the 1956 Suez Crisis. Egypt became increasingly involved in regional affairs until three years after the 1967 Six-Day War, in which Egypt lost the Sinai to Israel, Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat. Sadat revived an \"Egypt Above All\" orientation, switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the Infitah economic reform policy. Like his predecessor, he also clamped down on religious and leftist opposition alike.\n\nEgyptians fought one last time in the 1973 October War in an attempt to liberate Egyptian territories captured by Israel six years earlier. The October War presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai. In 1977, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel leading to the signing of the 1978 peace treaty, which was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians, in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat was assassinated in Cairo by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad in 1981, and was succeeded by Hosni Mubarak.\n\nHosni Mubarak was the president from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011, when he resigned under pressure of popular protest. Although power was ostensibly organized under a multi-party semi-presidential system, in practice it rested almost solely with the president. In late February 2005, for the first time since the 1952 coup d'état, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates, most prominently Ayman Nour. Most Egyptians were skeptical about the process of democratization and feared that power might ultimately be transferred to the president's first son, Gamal Mubarak.\n\nIn 2003, the Egyptian Movement for Change or simply \"Kefaya\" (Arabic for \"Enough!\") was founded as a grassroots mobilization of Egyptians seeking a return to democracy, a transparent government and greater equality and freedom.\n\nAfter the resignation of Hosni Mubarak presidential powers were transferred to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, who relinquished power on 30 June 2012 when Mohamed Morsi became the first democratically elected head of state in Egyptian history. He was ousted in a revolution a year after and is on trial.\n\nIn the presidential elections on 26–28 May 2014, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi won in a landslide, capturing 22 million of the nearly 23 million votes counted.\n\nEgyptian culture boasts five millennia of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the Near East and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of Hellenism, Christianity and Islamic culture. Today, many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern Western culture, itself influenced by Ancient Egypt.\n\nToday, Egyptians carry names that have Egyptian, Arabic, Turkish, and Greek origins (especially Coptic ones) among others. The concept of a surname is lacking in Egypt. Rather, Egyptians tend to carry their father's name as their first middle name, and stop at the 2nd or 3rd first name, which thus becomes one's surname. In this manner, surnames continuously change with generations, as first names of 4th or 5th generations get dropped.\nIt is not entirely unusual for families of Egyptian origin (especially Coptic ones) to have names or family names beginning with the Egyptian masculine possessive pronoun \"pa\" (generally \"ba\" in Arabic, which lost the phoneme in the course of developing from Proto-Semitic). For example, Bayoumi (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy) \"of Fayyoum\", Fayyoum meaning \"of the big water (yom)\", Basyouni (of Aswan), Bashandi, Bakhoum (\"the eagle\"), Bekhit, Bahur (\"of Horus\") and Banoub (\"of Anubis\").\n\nThe name Shenouda, which is very common among Copts, means \"child of God\". Hence, names and many toponyms may end with \"-nouda\", \"-noudi\" or \"-nuti\", which means \"Of God\" in Egyptian and Coptic. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as Minyawi from Minya and Suyuti from Asyut; or from one of the local Sufi orders such as el-Shazli and el-Sawy. More examples of prominent surnames are Qozman and Habib.\n\nWith the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became Hellenized and Arabized, meaning they were altered to sound Greek or Arabic. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix \"-ios\" to Egyptian names; for example, Pakhom to Pakhomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article \"el\" to names such as Baymoui to el-Bayoumi.\n\nNames starting with the Egyptian affix \"pu\" (\"of the place of\") were sometimes Arabized to \"abu\" (\"father of\"); for example, Busiri (\"of the place of Osiris\") occasionally became Abusir and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shamy (\"the Levantine\") indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Dewidar indicating an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri (\"the Egyptian\") suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are more likely to retain indigenous names given their relative isolation throughout the Egyptian people's history.\n\nWith French influence, names like Mounier, Pierre, and many others became common, particularly in the Christian community.\n\nBeginning in the predynastic period, some differences between the populations of Upper and Lower Egypt were ascertained through their skeletal remains, suggesting a gradual clinal pattern north to south.\nWhen Lower and Upper Egypt were unified \"c\". 3200 BC, the distinction began to blur, resulting in a more homogeneous population in Egypt, though the distinction remains true to some degree to this day. Some biological anthropologists such as Shomarka Keita believe the range of variability to be primarily indigenous and not necessarily the result of significant intermingling of widely divergent peoples.\n\nKeita describes the northern and southern patterns of the early predynastic period as \"northern-Egyptian-Maghreb\" and \"tropical African variant\" (overlapping with Nubia/Kush) respectively. He shows that a progressive change in Upper Egypt toward the northern Egyptian pattern takes place through the predynastic period. The southern pattern continues to predominate in Abydos, Upper Egypt by the First Dynasty, but \"lower Egyptian, Maghrebian, and European patterns are observed also, thus making for great diversity.\"\n\nA group of noted physical anthropologists conducted craniofacial studies of Egyptian skeletal remains and concluded similarly that \"the Egyptians have been in place since back in the Pleistocene and have been largely unaffected by either invasions or migrations. As others have noted, Egyptians are Egyptians, and they were so in the past as well.\"\n\nGenetic analysis of modern Egyptians reveals that they have paternal lineages common to indigenous North-East African populations primarily and to Near Eastern peoples to a lesser extent—these lineages would have spread during the Neolithic and were maintained by the predynastic period.\nUniversity of Chicago Egyptologist Frank Yurco suggested a historical, regional and ethnolinguistic continuity, asserting that \"the mummies and skeletons of ancient Egyptians indicate they were Africans of the Afro-Asiatic ethnic grouping\". He writes:\n\"Certainly there was some foreign admixture [in Egypt], but basically a homogeneous African population had lived in the Nile Valley from ancient to modern times... [the] Badarian people, who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a [Nile Valley] continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-[Nile Valley] population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was a distinct Afro-Asiatic African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.\"\n\nA 2006 bioarchaeological study on the dental morphology of ancient Egyptians by Prof. Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent Southwest Asian and southern European populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the , which clustered very closely with the Badarian series of the predynastic period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:\n[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced dentitions that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a–c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing phenetic distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD ¼ 0.050), 11–12th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th–30th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... Gebel Ramlah [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from Badari based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.\n\n\n"}

His subsequent disappearance has been subject to controversy and speculation by journalists and scholars.\n\nLyushkov was born in Odessa in the Russian Empire in 1900. His Jewish father supported him and his siblings as a tailor. He began his education in 1908 in a state-owned, six-classroom school, continuing there until 1915. While in school, he was influenced by his brother (a member of the Bolshevik underground) to join the Bolshevik Party and take part in the Russian Revolution several years later.\n\nIn April 1919, he received political training in Kiev for the Ukrainian People's Republic. During this time, the Russian Civil War broke out and after his graduation in September of that year, Lyushkov was assigned to the Bolshevik 14th Army for political work, where he saw combat against Poles and the White Russian forces of Anton Denikin. By then, he was a fully-fledged political commissar and had received the Order of the Red Banner.\n\nIn November 1920, he joined the Cheka of Odessa, which became known for its ruthlessness. He also served in Moscow and Ukraine. When the Cheka was disbanded and reformed into the GPU (the Государственное политическое управление НКВД РСФСР or \"State Political Directorate\"), Lyushkov rose even further. Around 1930, he carried out an industrial espionage assignment in Germany, where he monitored activities within the Junkers aviation company, bringing him the favour of Joseph Stalin. This success led to his working again within the USSR, now as a member of the NKVD (the Народный комиссариат внутренних дел or \"People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs\"). He was quickly transferred to preferential positions such as his posting as the NKVD chief in the Sea of Azov-Black Sea region as well as being awarded the Order of Lenin \"for exemplary performance of tasks of the Party and government.\" He was also made a deputy of the Supreme Soviet and a member of the Central Committee.\n\nDuring the time of the Moscow Trials, he was the one who led the interrogations of Zinoviev and Kamenev. Later, he earned a reputation as \"an arrogant, arbitrary and sadistic bully...\" On 31 July 1937, he received his final posting, as the NKVD chief in the Russian Far East, where he had direct command over \"20,000–30,000 élite NKVD troops.\"\n\nWhen he was given the post, he was, according to a later interview with Japanese military officials, given personal orders to aid in the elimination of specific officials as a part of the Great Purge: Vsevolod Balitsky (the former NKVD chief in the Far East, whom Lyushkov was replacing), Vasily Blyukher (a Marshal of the Soviet Union), and A. I. Lapin (the Far East Air Corps Commander). Balitsky, Blyukher, and Lapin all fell victim to the Great Purge. Balitsky's arrest and execution resulted from evidence gathered by Lyushkov. Blyukher's arrest and subsequent death resulted from blame being assigned to him for Lyushkov's defection. Lapin committed suicide while imprisoned.\n\nPrompted by his Japanese interrogators, Lyushkov gave one of the earliest explanations of the circumstances of the Great Purge, arguing that he had been merely appeasing Stalin and that he had no choice but to carry out his orders. Lyushkov, immediately upon arriving in Khabarovsk, saw that Balitsky had been arrested and sent to Moscow for trial and execution.\n\nHowever, his time in the post proved to be short. When the Great Purge was near its peak and NKVD boss Nikolai Yezhov was gradually losing power, Lyushkov received a summons to return to Moscow, but strongly suspected that it would mean his own arrest and execution, since his own two predecessors in his post, Terenty Deribas and Balitsky, had both been purged. Balitsky had been convicted on information from Lyushkov himself, whom he had considered a friend.\n\nBy then, Lyushkov had been promoted to \"third-rank commissar of state security\" (комиссар госбезопасности 3-го ранга) or \"Commissar 3rd Class\", the approximate equivalent of a major-general in the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nIn preparation for his defection, Lyushkov arranged for his Jewish wife, Inna, to leave the country with his eleven-year-old daughter, for the daughter to receive medical treatment in Poland. The plan was for Inna to embed a secret codeword into a telegram, which would signal to Lyushkov that it was safe for him to leave the Soviet Union.\n\nUnder unknown circumstances, however, Inna and her daughter were captured. Though the daughter's fate remains unknown, Inna was kept at the Lubyanka prison and tortured for information throughout late 1938 before eventually being executed. Other members of Lyushkov's family were arrested and imprisoned in Siberian gulags. While his mother and brother were both killed, his sister survived her imprisonment.\n\nOn 13 June 1938, Lyushkov defected from the Soviet Union by crossing the border into Manchukuo with valuable secret documents about the Soviet military strength in the region, which was much greater than the Japanese had realised. He was the highest-ranking secret police official to defect; he also had the greatest inside knowledge about the purges within the Soviet Red Army because of his own participation in carrying them out.\n\nHis defection was initially kept a state secret by Japan, but the revelation of his defection was judged to have a high propaganda value, so the decision was made to release the news to the world. A press conference was arranged at a Tokyo hotel on 13 July, a month after Lyushkov had defected. He \"categorically denied Moscow's allegation that he was an imposter\" but some news agencies, such as the \"New York Times\" wondered if he was telling the truth.\n\nDuring subsequent interviews and interactions with Japanese military personnel, Lyushkov adopted an anti-Stalinist position. However, his professed political views remained socialistic in nature according to the recollections of some Japanese intelligence officers, with Lyushkov calling himself a Trotskyite, but some Japanese officers believed that he had later become a liberal communist. Though Lyushkov was anti-Stalinist, he was resistant to the idea of creating a new regime led by Russian émigrés. He was, however, willing to include them in a proposed plan for the assassination of Stalin.\n\nA resistance group of Russian emigrants would travel across the Turkish-Soviet border when Stalin would travel south to a resort in Sochi, which he had visited previously to swim in the Matsesta River. Lyushkov's intimate knowledge of NKVD procedures and the way Stalin's guard detail would be organised encouraged the Japanese to support the plan. However, a Soviet agent had infiltrated the group of Russian exiles and foiled the plan, which was considered the only serious attempt to assassinate Stalin.\n\nLyushkov was able to detail the strength of the Red Army in the Far East, Siberia and Ukraine, simultaneously providing Soviet military radio codes. He was considered highly intelligent and dedicated, producing great volumes of written material, but there was some uncertainty about his ability to provide useful information specific to military operations.\n\nAs he spent more time in Japan, his hard work impressed the Japanese intelligence officers with whom he had been assigned to work. The staff of the Imperial Japanese Army had concerns, however, about his psychological state, especially pertaining to the status of his wife and daughter, about whom he had heard no news since his defection. After a failed search by Japanese intelligence agents for his family, a plan to both pacify and \"domesticate\" Lyushkov was decided upon: he would be paired with a woman, both to distract him from the question of his family's status and to keep him rooted in Japan. An eventual match was found after Lyushkov refused several White émigré women.\n\nAt some point, he began to make plans to travel to the United States and contacted an American publisher about a possible autobiography that he would write. He had concerns that he might be prevented from leaving Japan and went as far as to negotiate a written safe-conduct guarantee.\n\nAfter Germany's capitulation, Lyushkov was sent on 20 July 1945 to work for the Japanese Kwantung Army's Special Intelligence authorities in the puppet state of Manchukuo. On 9 August 1945, the Soviet invasion of Manchuria commenced and Lyushkov vanished in the confusion of the assault, where he was reportedly last seen in a crowd at a Dairen train station.\n\nOther theories hold that he was captured by the Red Army or that he was killed on the orders of a Japanese Special Intelligence officer to prevent him from giving away Japanese military secrets to the Soviet Union. Lyushkov's ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23472745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23472745", "title": "Interrogation of Saddam Hussein", "text": "Interrogation of Saddam Hussein\n\nThe Interrogation of Saddam Hussein began shortly after his December 2003 capture, while the deposed President of Iraq was held at the United States Camp Cropper detention facility at Baghdad International Airport. Beginning in February 2004, the interrogation program, codenamed Operation Desert Spider, was controlled by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents. Standard FBI FD-302 forms filed at the time were declassified and released in 2009 under a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request filed by the National Security Archive. Saddam, identified as \"High Value Detainee #1\" in the documents, was the subject of 20 \"formal interviews\" followed by five \"casual conversations.\" Questioning covered the span of Saddam's political career, from 2003 when he was found hiding in a \"spider hole\" on a farm near his home town of Tikrit, back to his role in a failed 1959 coup attempt in Iraq, after which he had taken refuge in the very same place, one report noted.\n\nDetailed questioning covered the Iran–Iraq War and his use of chemical weapons against Iranians. Saddam denied repeated assertions by his interrogator of a current weapons of mass destruction capability in Iraq, yet had resisted U.N. weapons inspections because he \"was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities than the repercussions of the United States for his refusal to allow U.N. inspectors back into Iraq,\" according to the reports. The former leader reportedly maintained that he did not collaborate with Al-Qaeda, as had been suggested by George W. Bush administration officials in support of its policy of regime change in Iraq. Saddam said he feared Al-Qaeda would have turned on him, and was quoted calling Osama bin Laden a \"zealot.\" The face-to-face sessions were conducted by Assyrian American George Piro, an FBI supervisory special agent (SSA), one of only a few FBI agents who spoke Arabic fluently. Saddam was led to believe that his interrogator was a high-ranking U.S. government official with direct access to U.S. President George W. Bush, when in reality he was in a relatively low-level position at the time.\nPiro discussed the interrogation process during an interview on the television news magazine \"60 Minutes\" in January 2008.\nIn an official statement, a senior FBI official in Piro’s chain of command characterized the perceived success of their interrogation of Saddam Hussein as one of the agency's top accomplishments in its 100-year history.\n\nIn 1957, at the age of 20, Saddam Hussein joined the nascent Ba'ath Party, which was founded on a socialist form of Pan-Arabism. After participating in an unsuccessful 1959 assassination attempt on then Prime Minister of Iraq Abd al-Karim Qasim, Saddam became a fugitive, and eventually fled to Syria and then Egypt. Following the Ba'athists overthrow of the prime minister in the February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état, and the counter-coup half a year later, Saddam was jailed in Iraq from 1964 to 1966. The Ba'ath party returned to power after another successful coup in 1968. General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, a relative of Saddam Hussein, became President, and Saddam became his deputy. In 1979, Saddam Hussein displaced General Bakr, and a little more than a year later, he ordered Iraqi troops to invade Iran, starting the Iran–Iraq War that would continue until 1988. Iraq's 1990 Invasion of Kuwait led to the 1991 Gulf War. In 1998, Saddam halted Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission weapons inspections imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War, and kept U.N. inspectors out until 2002. In March 2003, the United States led an invasion of Iraq that quickly toppled the government. Saddam fled the capital of Baghdad shortly before it fell in mid April, and disappeared; he was finally captured on December 13 of that year by U.S. soldiers. Saddam remained in U.S. military custody throughout his subsequent criminal trial. On November 5, 2006, Saddam was found guilty of crimes against humanity, and was turned over to the Iraqi Interim Government for his execution by hanging just before the end of that year, on the 30th of December.\n\nWhen Saddam was initially questioned, he gave his U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps interrogators only evasive or rhetorical answers.\nControl of his interrogation was soon transferred from the military intelligence interrogators, who are typically represented in the field by less experienced junior officers trained to obtain operational intelligence,\nover to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), because of their broader experience and capabilities.\nWhile Saddam's official status was initially undetermined pending legal review, the U.S. Defense Department announced that he was classified as a prisoner of war on January 9, 2004.\nAfter Saddam was declared a prisoner of war, he had to be repatriated to his home country of Iraq after cessation of hostilities, according to the International Red Cross, who monitors compliance with the Geneva Conventions.\nThe U.S. Government had also announced that it wanted to turn him over to a new Iraqi government for a public trial with international observers. The CIA realized early on that covert officers conducting the interrogations could end up being called as witnesses in a future court proceeding, and invited the FBI to take a more active role.\nControl of the interrogation was finally transferred to FBI agents, who are trained to interview suspects in preparation for prosecutions. The combined interrogation team was composed of CIA analysts and FBI agents, intelligence analysts, language specialists, and a behavioral profiler.\n\nThe FBI began documenting sessions they characterized as \"formal interviews\" beginning on February 7. There is little public information available on the interrogations prior to this date since the operations were secret, but one unnamed U.S. official described the process as \"a chess game,\" because Saddam was facing a possible death sentence, and had little incentive to speak. Several experts speaking publicly at the time made similar assessments, and set low expectations for the information that could be obtained from Saddam. Although it was speculated that the CIA would employ multiple interrogators using good cop/bad cop role play,\nthe FBI used a single primary interrogator, SSA George Piro, who built up a rapport with Saddam over time. Piro said that their bond became so strong that he saw Saddam tear up when they said goodbye for the last time.\n\nPiro described how he seated Saddam with \"his back against the wall\" to reinforce that psychological impression, but denied using any of the enhanced interrogation techniques approved for use by the CIA, because he said it was against FBI policy, and would not have worked in this case. In the 2008 \"60 Minutes\" interview, he revealed details of how he took total control over the prisoner's situation to create a dependence that he would use to obtain cooperation. He also listened patiently as his subject gave his recollections and interpretation of historical events, appealing to Saddam's sense of self-importance to obtain information. Prisoner of war status placed certain constraints on the permissible interrogation techniques; for example, threats of punishment or offers of improved conditions in return for cooperation were prohibited, according to Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on the Geneva Conventions who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAlthough the FBI reports were generally written in a narrative fashion, they occasionally provided direct quotations attributed to Saddam Hussein, translated from Arabic to English by the FBI. Some of these quotes were highlighted in secondary source accounts of the reports, including these (grouped by subject in rough chronological order):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of press reports describe the Iraqi dictator admitting to a catastrophic miscalculation, having misled the United States into believing Iraq still possessed biological and chemical weapons. According to the \"Associated Press\": \"Saddam Hussein told an FBI interviewer before he was hanged that he allowed the world to believe he had weapons of mass destruction because he was worried about appearing weak to Iran\".\n\nThis interpretation has been challenged by journalist Solomon Hughes, writing: \"You might remember that we invaded Iraq because Saddam did have WMD, but was pretending he didn't. Now it turns out we invaded Iraq because Saddam did not have WMD, but pretended he did.\"\n\nHow did Saddam let the world believe Iraq had WMD by denying he had WMD? How does this story work? It doesn't, because the [Associated Press] report is false. FBI agent Pinto's actual record of a casual conversation with Saddam reads: \"Even though Hussein claimed Iraq did not have WMD, the threat from Iran was a major factor as to why he did not allow the return of the UN inspectors. Hussein stated he was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq's weaknesses and vulnerabilities than the repercussions of the United States for his refusal to allow UN inspectors back into Iraq.\" So in 1998 Saddam resisted the UN weapons inspectors because he did not want to look weak in front of Iran, with whom he had fought a vicious eight-year war. This is not the same as pretending to have WMD. Saddam did not want to look like he could be pushed around by the UN lest his neighbours scent weakness, but his government repeatedly—and accurately—denied having WMD.\n\nThe chronology of the reported meetings between Piro and Saddam in 2004:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "365451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365451", "title": "Itamar Franco", "text": "Itamar Franco\n\nItamar Augusto Cautiero Franco (; June 28, 1930July 2, 2011) was a Brazilian politician who served as the 33rd President of Brazil from December 29, 1992 to December 31, 1994. Previously he was Vice President of Brazil from 1990 until the resignation of President Fernando Collor de Mello. During his long political career Franco also served as Senator, Mayor, Ambassador and Governor. At the time of his death he was a Senator from Minas Gerais, having won the seat in the 2010 election.\n\nFranco was born prematurely at sea, aboard a ship traveling between Salvador and Rio de Janeiro, being registered in Salvador. On his father's side he was of partial German descent (the Stiebler family from Minas Gerais), while on the mother's side he was of Italian descent, with both of his maternal grandparents having emigrated to Brazil from Italy. His mother's name was \"Itália\", which means \"Italy\" in Portuguese. Franco's father died before his birth.\n\nHis family was from Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, where he grew up and became a civil engineer in 1955, graduating from the School of Engineering of Juiz de Fora.\n\nEntering politics in the mid-1950s, Franco first served as alderman and deputy mayor of Juiz de Fora, before getting elected as mayor (1967 to 1971 and again from 1973 to 1974). He resigned as mayor in 1974 and ran successfully for the Federal Senate as a representative of Minas Gerais. He soon became a senior figure in the MDB (Movimento Democrático Brasileiro – Brazilian Democratic Movement he was deputy leader twice, in 1976 and 1977), the official opposition to the military regime that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. Re-elected as a senator in 1982, he was defeated in an attempt to be elected governor of Minas Gerais in 1986 as a candidate of the Liberal Party (PL). During his tenure he was one of the key figures of (then failed) initiative to immediate restoration of the direct elections for President. During his Senate term, Franco served as PL leader in that chamber.\n\nAs a member of the National Constituent Assembly which began on February 1, 1987, Franco voted for severance of relations between Brazil and countries that develop a policy of racial discrimination (as was then the case of South Africa), the establishment of the writ of mandamus Collective; 50% more pay for overtime after a forty-hour work-week, the legalization of abortion, the continuous shift of six hours of notice proportional to length of service, the union unity, popular sovereignty, the nationalization of subsoil, the nationalization of the financial system of a limiting the payment of external debt burden and creating a fund to support land reform.\n\nMeanwhile, he voted against propositions to reintroduce the death penalty, confirming the presidential system and extension of President José Sarney's term, whom he opposed and called for removal for an alleged corruption. When Franco became President, Sarney became one of his allies.\n\nIn 1989, Franco left PL and joined the small PRN (National Reconstruction Party) to be selected the running-mate of the presidential candidate Fernando Collor de Mello. A main reason behind Franco's selection was that he represented one of the largest states (in contrast to Collor, who was from small state of Alagoas), and publicity he gained during his call for impeachment against President José Sarney for alleged corruption.\n\nCollor and Franco won a very narrow election against a man who would later become President (2003–2010), Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nOnce in office, Franco broke with Collor, threatening a resignation several times, as he disagreed with some of the President's policies, especially regarding privatization, voicing his opposition openly.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 29, 1992, Collor was charged with corruption and was impeached by the Congress. Under the Brazilian Constitution, an impeached president's powers are suspended for 180 days. As such, Franco served as acting president from October 2, 1992 until Collor resigned on December 29, at which point he formally took office as president.\n\nWhen he became acting President, despite having been Vice President for nearly three years, polls showed that the majority of the population did not know who he was.\n\nFranco took power as Brazil was in the midst of a severe economic crisis, with inflation reaching 1,110% in 1992 and rocketing to almost 2,400% in 1993. Franco developed a reputation as a mercurial leader, but he selected as his Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who launched the \"Plano Real\" that stabilized the economy and ended inflation.\n\nIn an unusual gesture, moments before taking office, Franco handed senators a piece of paper on which he had listed his personal net worth and properties. Initially, his approval rating reached 60 percent.\n\nAfter the troubled Collor Presidency, Franco quickly installed a politically-balanced cabinet and sought broad support in Congress.\n\nDuring his Presidency, in April 1993, Brazil held a long-announced referendum to determine the political system (remaining a Republic or restoration of the Monarchy) and the form of government (presidential or parliamentary system). The Republican and presidential system prevailed by large majorities respectively. Franco always preferred the parliamentary government.\n\nIn 1993, Franco resisted calls from various military and civilian offices to shut down the Congress (described by some sources as a \"coup attempt\").\n\nHis administration is credited for restoring integrity and stability in government, particularly after the troubled Collor presidency. The President himself kept his reputation of honesty, and his personal style was viewed as very different from Collor's, who practiced \"an imperial and ceremonious presidential role\". On the other hand, Franco's own personal behavior was sometimes described as temperamental and eccentric.\n\nIn late 1993, Franco offered a resignation in order to call an earlier election, but Congress turned it down.\n\nAt the end of term, Franco's job approval rating soared to nearly 80–90 percent.\nUntil May 2016, Franco remained the last President of Brazil not to have been elected as such.\n\nDespite being sometimes described as a \"man with limited diplomatic skills\", Franco is credited with launching of idea of a free trade zone covering the whole of South America, which was praised by such leaders as U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nAlso during his Government, Brazil ratified important pacts (for example the Tlatelolco Treaty and a quadripartite agreement also involving Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency on full-scope safeguards), which set Brazil on the nonproliferation path.\n\nFranco was barred from running for a full term in 1994. Whenever a Brazilian vice president serves part of a president's term, it counts as a full term, and at the time Brazilian presidents were barred from immediate reelection. Fernando Henrique Cardoso became the official (sometimes described as Franco's hand-picked) candidate to succeed Franco and was elected President in late 1994. Franco, however, soon became a severe critic of Cardoso's government and disagreed with the privatization program. Thereafter, he served as the Ambassador to Portugal in Lisbon and then as Ambassador to the Organization of American States in Washington, DC, until 1998.\nFranco considered a presidential run in 1998, but ultimately backed off after constitution changes allowed Cardoso to run again. However, he was elected governor of Minas Gerais in 1998 against the Cardoso-supported incumbent in a landslide, and as soon as he took office, he enacted a moratorium on state debt payments, worsening the national economic crisis. Itamar Franco served in the governor's seat until 2003 (declining to seek reelection and supporting the eventual winning candidate Aécio Neves) and was then the ambassador to Italy, until leaving the position in 2005. During the 2002 presidential election, Franco endorsed Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who got elected, even if he, again, declined to run himself.\n\nHaving unsuccessfully sought, at age 76, the PMDB presidential nomination in 2006, he backed Geraldo Alckmin against Lula, despite having been considered again, despite his advanced age, as a candidate for President in 2010.\n\nFranco ran instead for to be a Senator from Minas, and won the race along with Neves.\n\nFranco was divorced in 1971 and had two daughters. Before and during his presidency, he had a reputation as a ladies' man, and his personal life was a subject of huge public interest.\n\nHe authored some 19 published works, ranging from discussions on nuclear energy to short stories.\n\nHaving been diagnosed with leukemia, Franco was admitted to the Albert Einstein Hospital, in São Paulo, on May 21, 2011. On June 28, his condition worsened and he developed severe pneumonia, being taken to ICU and placed under mechanical ventilation. He died in the morning of Saturday, July 2, 2011, after suffering a stroke. Seven days of mourning were declared by President Dilma Rousseff. After lying in state in the town of Juiz de Fora, his political base, and in Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, his body was cremated on Monday, July 4, 2011, in Contagem, in the metropolitan area of that city.\n\n"}

He became the first Indonesian musician to chart on \"Billboard\" 200 when his album, \"My Favorite Things\", debuted at number 174.\n\nA child prodigy, Joey Alexander taught himself to play jazz at age six, by listening to his father's classic jazz albums. He won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Master-Jam Fest when he was nine.\n\nIn 2014, Wynton Marsalis invited him to play at Jazz at Lincoln Center, which, according to \"The New York Times\", made him an \"overnight sensation\". He released his first album, \"My Favorite Things\", in 2015 at age 11. Joey Alexander played at the Montreal and Newport Jazz Festivals in 2015, and has performed for Herbie Hancock, Bill Clinton, Wendy Kiess, and Barack Obama.\n\nJosiah Alexander Sila was born in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, to parents Denny Sila and Farah Leonora Urbach, who ran an adventure tourism business. His father was an amateur musician, and both parents were fans of jazz, particularly Louis Armstrong. He is the nephew of the rock singer Nafa Urbach, and the Indonesian musician and songwriter Alam Urbach. He learned about jazz by listening to classic albums his father gave him. By age six, he had taught himself to play piano using a miniature, electric keyboard his father brought home for him, learning by ear compositions such as Thelonious Monk's \"Well, You Needn't\" and other songs from his father's jazz collection. He later said learning the instrument came naturally to him, and considers his ability \"a gift from God\". He cites as influences John Coltrane, Harry Connick Jr., Bill Evans, and Herbie Hancock, and he particularly admires Clifford Brown, Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, Brad Mehldau, Lee Morgan, Horace Silver, and McCoy Tyner.\n\nDue to the unavailability of jazz education in his home town, he participated in jam sessions in Bali and Jakarta, where his family moved after disbanding their tourism business so he could live near Indonesia's top jazz musicians. When he was eight, he played for Herbie Hancock when Hancock was visiting Jakarta as a UNESCO goodwill ambassador. Hancock told Joey Alexander that he believed in him, and Joey Alexander later called that time \"the day I decided to dedicate my childhood to jazz\". At age 9, he won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Master-Jam Fest, an all-ages jazz competition in Odessa, Ukraine, which included 43 musicians from 17 nations. In 2014, he and his family moved to New York City to pursue a career in music.\n\nJazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, learned about Joey Alexander after a friend suggested he watch a YouTube video clip of him playing compositions by Coltrane, Monk and Chick Corea. Marsalis praised Joey Alexander as \"my hero\" on his Facebook page, and invited him to appear at his organization's gala in May 2014, when he was 10. It marked Joey Alexander's United States debut. He received positive reviews for his performance, particularly for his solo version of the Monk song \"'Round Midnight\". \"The New York Times\" said he became an \"overnight sensation\" after the performance. Allen Morrison of \"Down Beat\" magazine said of the performance: \"If the word 'genius' still means anything, it applies to this prodigy. He played his own solo variations on 'Round Midnight' with a breathtaking precocity and mastery of several decades of piano style.\" Marsalis said of him: \"There has never been anyone that you can think of who could play like that at his age. I loved everything about his playing – his rhythm, his confidence, his understanding of the music.\" Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, widow of tennis player Arthur Ashe, invited Joey Alexander to perform at the Arthur Ashe Learning Center gala, where he played for a crowd that included former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Moutoussamy-Ashe introduced him to Gordon Uehling III, founder of the CourtSense Tennis Training Center, who has allowed Joey Alexander and his family to stay at his estate in Alpine, New Jersey.\n\nJoey Alexander played at A Great Night in Harlem at the Apollo Theater, a performance honoring Herbie Hancock. His performance at the University of the District of Columbia garnered viral attention on the internet, drawing more than 500,000 views on Facebook. He also played in a concert with students of the Juilliard School, the proceeds of which funded his continuing stay in New York City. The concert, which received national media attention on NBC News, was successful enough for him to obtain an O-1B visa, which is granted to \"individuals with extraordinary ability\". He also gave concert performances in 2014 at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival and the International Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta.\n\nJoey Alexander's debut album, \"My Favorite Things\", was released on 12 May 2015, on the Harlem-based label Motéma Music and produced by Jason Olaine. He was 11 at the time of its release. He began recording the album in October 2014. He arranged all the songs on the album, which includes renditions of \"'Round Midnight\", Coltrane's \"Giant Steps\" and Billy Strayhorn's \"Lush Life\". It also includes an original composition called \"Ma Blues\", which was inspired by Bobby Timmons' \"Moanin'\". \"My Favorite Things\" featured Alexander alongside Russell Hall, Alphonso Horne and Sammy Miller, as well as guest performers Larry Grenadier and Ulysses Owens. He had several performances in 2015, including one at the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and another at the Newport Jazz Festival in August. Newport producer George Wein is reluctant to sign alleged child prodigies, but made an exception after Moutoussamy-Ashe took Joey Alexander to Wein's Manhattan apartment to play for him. Wein said he distinguished himself with \"the maturity of his harmonic approach\". The Jazz at Lincoln Center has expressed interest in incorporating Joey Alexander into its educational outreach efforts, hoping to encourage young people to listen to jazz music.\n\nIn February 2016, Joey Alexander was a runner-up through his nomination for the Grammy Awards Best Jazz Instrumental Album (for \"My Favorite Things\") and Best Improvised Jazz Solo (for \"Giant Steps\"). He performed live at the Premiere Ceremony, the pre-telecast ceremony at the Grammy Awards.\n\nIn September 2016, Joey Alexander released his second album \"Countdown\", named after the John Coltrane track.

{"id": "7131726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7131726", "title": "Kanang anak Langkau", "text": "Kanang anak Langkau\n\nPW1 Temenggong Datuk Kanang anak Langkau, SP, PGB, PGBK, PBS (Rt) (2 March 1945 – 3 January 2013) was a Malaysian hero and soldier from the Iban Dayak community in Sarawak. He was in the Royal Ranger Regiment and Regimental Sergeant Major of 8 Renjer (8th Rangers) of the Malaysian Army with his tag number of 901378. He was awarded the Panglima Gagah Berani and Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa medals from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Ahmad Shah on 3 June 1981. He is the sole recipient of both the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa and Pingat Gagah Berani, and was the last living recipient of the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa. In the annals of the Malaysian Military History, no one person was more decorated than Kanang anak Langkau of the Ranger Corps. He is one of the very few survivors ever conferred the \"Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa\" (Valour Award) whilst still alive and a \"Pingat Gagah Berani\" (the Bravery Medal). No other person has ever received two gallantry awards in the history of the Malaysian Armed Forces. No other Corps can boast of a warrior of his stature but the Ranger Corps.\n\nKanang anak Langkau was born on 2 March 1945 in Julau, Sarawak. He entered military service with the British Army, as an Iban Tracker, attending Jungle Warfare School in Ulu Tiram in early 1962. Kanang was attached to the 42 Commando serving during the Brunei Revolt and during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. He later served with the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment. He was absorbed into the Sarawak Rangers which eventually became part of the Malaysian Rangers when Malaysia was proclaimed on 16 September 1963.\n\nKanang joined the Sarawak Rangers as an Iban tracker on 21 April 1962. (He was among those recruited by the late Bennett Jarrow). Sarawak Rangers was then part of the British Army and later absorbed into the Malaysian Army’s Royal Ranger Regiment upon the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 between the then Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah (then North Borneo) and Sarawak with Singapore ceded later and Brunei opted not to join.\n\nIn an operation in the Korbu Forest Reserve at Fort Legap on 1 June 1979 whilst on a mission tracking the enemy, Sergeant Kanang's group came across a temporary enemy resting camp. Sergeant Kanang ak Langkau from the 8th Battalion Royal Rangers immediately launched an attack on that enemy camp, an enemy that far outnumbered the Kanang's group. In this fierce contact with the enemy, two of the Rangers went down, mortally wounded. Five of the enemy were killed, enemy equipment too were captured. He was conferred the highest gallantry award, the \"Pingat Gagah Berani\" by his Majesty the King.\n\nIn an incident in Tanah Hitam, Perak on 8 February 1980 a soldier was killed. Kanang leading a platoon was sent to track the enemy down and destroy them. For eleven days they tracked the enemy until they stumbled upon a much larger enemy force at Ladang Kinding, Sungei Siput, Perak.\n\nThe tracking skills of Kanang and his courage led him successfully to follow up on the enemy. The enemy was cunning and skillful in the use of the ground to their advantage. The lay of the land at that time was an obstacle as they were in very difficult terrain. The enemy was very adept at concealment, with the years piled on fighting the British and the Malayans before that. The tactics used by the enemy to throw off Kanang and his group off their trail was never ending. Due to the courage of Kanang and his tracking skills, the Rangers managed to keep up with the enemy. Even as some of his men were disheartened, he kept their morale up by encouraging them.\n\nSince the death of the soldier 11 days he managed to doggedly track and identify the enemy's exact route of escape. On the evening of 19 February 1980 at around 1500, after conducting a reconnaissance with great caution and care, his platoon managed to estimate the location of the enemy, which was located not very far from their location.\n\nActually they were inside the location of the enemy, as they were at the foot of the hill. They only realized that they were inside the enemy's location when they found a communication cord from the enemy sentry's location. This cord was running from the sentry's location to the enemy's main force. This cord is normally attached to a small bush or empty cans which make noise when pulled. This way the main force can be alerted by the sentry when an enemy approaches.\n\nAt that moment, Sergeant Kanang was approximately 8 meters from the enemy sentry's location. Realizing that, he launched the assault towards the right by firing towards the right of the enemy along with his platoon. After launching the attack to the right, it suddenly struck everyone that the enemy's main force was on the left, below the slope of the hill. Without losing his senses, he switched the direction of fire to the left, at the same time changing the direction of the assault to the left.\n\nThey ploughed into the enemy but a large force of the enemy managed to escape. The platoon and Kanang managed to bag five Communist Terrorists on that day. Even with that success, they were saddened by the loss of one of their group who was killed and one more seriously wounded. Whilst trying to rescue his wounded friends, Sergeant Kanang himself was repeatedly shot, he took three rounds from the enemy into his body. The will to live and fight another day was strong, he was in comma for two months in hospital but recuperated and was back on active duty. His fellow Ibans say Kanang died but came alive again!\n\nKanang’s battle cry ‘Agi Idup Agi Ngelaban’ (Still Alive, Still Fighting) inspired his men and other soldiers to fight to death in the defence of the nation. It is believed among the Ibans that this battle cry originated from the famous Iban warrior by the name of Libau \"Rentap\" who fought the Rajah of Sarawak, James Brooke at Skrang and Sadok Hill.\n\nThe son-in-law Of Libau \"Rentap\" named Layang was known to be the first Iban to kill (bedengah in Iban) a British officer in Sarawak by the name of Alan Lee at the battle of Lintang Batang at the newly built Skrang fort. It was this incident that caused the Brooke to refuse pardon or accept Rentap's surrender like the other Iban chiefs during that time, notably the sons of Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana \"Bayang\" by the name of Nanang and his second brother Luyoh who turned rebels against the Brooke government for killing their third brother Ajie at the battle of Sungai Langit in Padeh. Nanang was later appointed Orang Kaya Pemancha to replace his father, for his surrender and his assistance to defeat his fellow Iban chief Libau \"Rentap\" at Sadok Hill who he followed just before that surrender. The cannon named \"Bujang Timpang Berang\" (One Shoulder Guy) marked with the year 1515 was actually obtained by Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana \"Bayang\" in a ngayau expedition to Sambas, Kalimantan and inherited by his sons.\n\nLibau \"Rentap\" was only defeated after three repeated punitive expeditions by the Brooke force at Sadok Hill but he never surrendered to the White Man like his fellow countrymen did at that material time. He died as a hero and was accorded a warrior or chieftain cremation on a platform above the ground (called \"dilumbong\" in Iban) at the Sibau Hill in Pakan Sarawak and his bones were installed inside a jar in a traditional Iban ceremony called \"ngerapoh\" for safe keeping by his family vis-a-vis a normal burial under the ground for ordinary persons. In recent time, his bones were put inside a proper coffin and a sungkup hut built at the same Sibau Hill which can be visited by tourists.\n\nIndeed, the ngayau or headhunting spirit of the Ibans for which they were legendary before the practice ceased, is still very much in the blood and body of Kanang and other heroes from Sarawak.\n\nFor his bravery, Kanang was awarded the nation’s two highest awards Sri Pahlawan Perkasa (SP) and the Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) by His Majesty the King Yang Di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ahmad Shah in June 1981.\n\nHe retired as Warrant Officer One (WOI) after serving the army for more than 21 years.\n\nA book entitled Kanang, The Story of a Hero was written about his military service and used as a literature text book in the Malaysian national secondary school.\n\nPrior to Kanang, Awang anak Raweng who was an Iban Scout from Sarawak in Borneo, won the George Cross for gallantry as recorded in the London Gazette on 20 November 1951.[1] The only Sarawakian who was bestowed with the highest British gallantry award. King George bestowed the 83-year-old veteran from Nanga Skrang, Sri Aman with the George Cross on 20 November 1951 in recognition of his bravery in fighting the communists all by himself after he and four other British army personnel were ambushed in Kluang, Johor on 27 May 1951. Please note Nanga Skrang is the original place of the famous Iban warrior Libau \"Rentap\" during the James Brooke era.\n\nKanang retired after 21 years of service as a First Warrant Officer. He was the Temenggong (paramount chief) of the Iban in Sri Aman, his place of residence. He was awarded the Officer of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak (PBS) \"(Malay: Pegawai Bintang Sarawak)\" in 1987.\n\nMalaysia’s most decorated war hero Kanang Anak Langkau could have died as a pauper as his military services – helping to liberate Malaya (and later Malaysia) from the communists were not respected as a hero should be until he and few other war heroes made noise complaining that they had been treated shabbily both by the Federal Government and Sarawak State Government.\n\nTheir contributions were not financially recognized – not even a sen and their welfare were not taken care of, as compared to financial rewards and other perks given to communist terrorists who surrendered.\n\nThere were six holders of Sri Pahlawan (SP) Gagah Perkasa (the Gallantry Award) from Sarawak, and with the death of Kanang Anak Langkau, there is one SP holder in the person of Sgt. Ngalinuh (an Orang Ulu).\n\nThe heroes were 21 holders of Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) with 16 survivors. Of the total, there are fourteen (14) Ibans, one Bidayuh, one Kayan, one Malay and two Chinese army officers. But the majorities in the Armed Forces are Malays, according to a book – Crimson Tide over Borneo. The youngest of the PGB holder is ASP Wilfred Gomez of the Police Force.\n\nKanang Anak Langkau was the holder of both the SP and PGB. Their contributions were initially not rewarded, not even a sen except they received pensions like other retired civil servants.\n\nThe heroes were not even invited to attend national day celebrations.\n\nAngered by the ill-treatment, Kanang even refused ‘Datukship’ offered to him saying he was a poor man and could not afford to receive the title of ‘Datukship’.\n\nTheir woes got the attention of the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lubok Antu in Sarawak Mr. Jawah Gerang who raised the issue in Parliament some time in the 1980s. Approved by the government, a PGB holder was given a monthly allowance of RM300 and a SP holder RM400.\n\nFor PGB holders like Sgt Dajai Angie, their allowances were backdated to 1973. (Dajai was given the bravery medal in 1971).\n\nIn 2006, a delegation of the heroes from Sarawak met with the Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak and appealed to increase their monthly allowances by RM700.\n\nInstead of accepting their recommendation, Najib who was also the Deputy Prime Minister decided to more than double the increase of the allowance by RM1,600. The issue was brought to Parliament and approved. Thus, a SP holder receives RM2,000 a month, while a PGB holder receives RM1,900 a month.\n\nPromotionwise, only on 1 November 2010, an Iban Officer by the name of Stephen Mundaw was promoted to a Brigadier-General. He was the first Iban to become a General in the Malaysian Army since Sarawak became independent on 22 July 1963 from the British and forming The Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 along with North Borneo (Sabah now) and Singapore which was ceded later. If you want to look further; he was the first Iban General in the long history of the Malaysian Rangers when its predecessor the Sarawak Rangers was formed by Rajah Charles Brooke in 1862. With this promotion, inadvertently, \"an Iban allocation\" might have been created in the Malaysian Army.\n\nFor his knowledge in Iban traditions and customs, Kanang was later made a Temenggong for the Iban community of Sri Aman division and last year he was conferred a Datukship by the state government.\n\nOn 15 April 2009, he made headlines after rescuing a baby orangutan from captivity with his friend, Tay Choon Yong. The baby orangutan was being handed to Semenggoh Wildlife Centre.\n\nOn 24 September 2011, he was conferred the Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak (PGBK) \"(Panglima Gemilang Bintang Kenyalang\"), with the title of Datuk by the Abang Muhammad Salahuddin, the Head of State's 90th Birthday.\n\nIn 2011, Kanang supervised Operation Mai Pulai. This operation involved the locating and exhumation of the remains of 21 Iban Trackers and Sarawak Rangers who were killed during the Second Malayan Emergency. Their remains were exhumed from multiple location on the Malay Peninsula and returned to Sarawak where they were ceremonially reburied in July 2011.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, he collapsed while watching television at home in Sungai Apong, Sri Aman after complaining of chest pains. Immediately rushed to the Sarawak General Hospital, he was pronounced dead at the age of 67.\n\nHe was buried on 6 January with full military honours at the Heroes’ Grave at Jalan Budaya, Kuching.\n\nMeanwhile, messages of condolences and sympathy have been received by the family of the late Kanang from government leaders including from the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak and Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud.\n\nAccording to the Minister of Defence, Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, he will be given a national burial. His coffin, draped in the Jalur Gemilang and the colours of the Malaysian Armed Forces, was first brought to the 1st Infantry Division base located at Bukavu Camp in Penrissen for the family members and friends to perform prayers and miring ceremony (offering ceremony), before being brought to Kuching Civic Centre for the public to pay their last respects. He was buried at the Heroes' Grave in Jalan Taman Budaya, after the funeral prayers at St.Thomas Cathedral in Kuching.\n\nAmong Ibans, Kanang/s acts in the military service is regarded as \"raja berani tau serang\" which is commensurate with the highest widower fee for Great War Leader. Otherwise, his temenggong chieftain title entitled him for the fifth widower fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42154", "title": "Krishna", "text": "Krishna\n\nKrishna (, ; ) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu and also as the supreme God in his own right. He is the god of compassion, tenderness, and love in Hinduism, and is one of the most popular and widely revered among Indian divinities. Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as \"Krishna Leela\". He is a central character in the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and as the universal supreme being. His iconography reflects these legends, and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young man with Radha or surrounded by women devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.\n\nThe synonyms of Krishna have been traced to 1stmillenniumBCE literature. In some sub-traditions, Krishna is worshipped as \"Svayam Bhagavan\", and this is sometimes referred to as Krishnaism. These sub-traditions arose in the context of the medieval era Bhakti movement. Krishna-related literature has inspired numerous performance arts such as Bharatnatyam, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Manipuri dance. He is a pan-Hindu god, but is particularly revered in some locations such as Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, the Jagannatha aspect in Odisha, Mayapur in West Bengal, Dwarka and Junagadh in Gujarat, in the form of Vithoba in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, Nathdwara in Rajasthan, and Guruvayur in Kerala. Since the 1960s, the worship of Krishna has also spread to the Western world and to Africa, largely due to the work of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).\n\nThe name \"Krishna\" originates from the Sanskrit word \"\", which is primarily an adjective meaning \"black\", \"dark\", or \"dark blue\". The waning moon is called Krishna Paksha, relating to the adjective meaning \"darkening\". The name is also interpreted sometimes as \"all-attractive\".\n\nAs a name of Vishnu, Krishna is listed as the 57th name in the \"Vishnu Sahasranama\". Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted in idols as black- or blue-skinned. Krishna is also known by various other names, epithets, and titles that reflect his many associations and attributes. Among the most common names are \"Mohan\" \"enchanter\"; \"Govinda\" \"chief herdsman\", and \"Gopala\" \"Protector of the 'Go'\", which means \"Soul\" or \"the cows\". Some names for Krishna hold regional importance; \"Jagannatha\", found in Puri Hindu temple, is a popular incarnation in Odisha state and nearby regions of eastern India.\n\nKrishna is represented in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out of which he is formed, both in India and in southeast Asia. In some texts, his skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (\"Jamun\", a purple-colored fruit).\n\nKrishna is often depicted wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, and playing the bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg bent in front of the other in the \"Tribhanga\" posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman \"Govinda\". Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic and seductive man with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.\nIn other icons, he is a part of battlefield scenes of the epic \"Mahabharata\". He is shown as a charioteer, notably when he is addressing the Pandava prince Arjuna character, symbolically reflecting the events that led to the \"Bhagavad Gita\"a scripture of Hinduism. In these popular depictions, Krishna appears in the front as the charioteer, either as a counsel listening to Arjuna, or as the driver of the chariot while Arjuna aims his arrows in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.\n\nAlternate icons of Krishna show him as a baby (\"Bala Krishna\", the child Krishna), a toddler crawling on his hands and knees, a dancing child, or an innocent-looking child playfully stealing or consuming butter (\"Makkan Chor\"), holding Laddu in his hand (\"Laddu Gopal\") or as a cosmic infant sucking his toe while floating on a banyan leaf during the Pralaya (the cosmic dissolution) observed by sage Markandeya. Regional variations in the iconography of Krishna are seen in his different forms, such as Jaganatha in Odisha, Vithoba in Maharashtra, Shrinathji in Rajasthan and Guruvayoorappan in Kerala \n\nGuidelines for the preparation of Krishna icons in design and architecture are described in medieval-era Sanskrit texts on Hindu temple arts such as \"Vaikhanasa agama\", \"Vishnu dharmottara\", \"Brihat samhita\", and \"Agni Purana\". Similarly, early medieval-era Tamil texts also contain guidelines for sculpting Krishna and Rukmini. Several statues made according to these guidelines are in the collections of the Government Museum, Chennai.\n\nThe earliest text containing detailed descriptions of Krishna as a personality is the epic \"Mahabharata\", which depicts Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu. Krishna is central to many of the main stories of the epic. The eighteen chapters of the sixth book (\"Bhishma Parva\") of the epic that constitute the \"Bhagavad Gita\" contain the advice of Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield. The \"Harivamsa\", a later appendix to the \"Mahabharata\" contains a detailed version of Krishna's childhood and youth.\n\nThe \"Chandogya Upanishad\", estimated to have been composed sometime between the 8th and 6thcenturiesBCE, has been another source of speculation regarding Krishna in ancient India. The verse (III.xvii.6) mentions Krishna in \"Krishnaya Devakiputraya\" (Sanskrit: कृष्णाय देवकीपुत्राय) as a student of the sage \"Ghora\" of the \"Angirasa\" family. This phrase, which means \"To Krishna the son of Devaki\", has been mentioned by scholars such as Max Müller as a potential source of fables and Vedic lore about Krishna in the \"Mahabharata\" and other ancient literature only potential, because this verse could have been interpolated into the text, or the Krishna Devakiputra, could be different from the deity Krishna. These doubts are supported by the fact that the much later age \"Sandilya Bhakti Sutras\", a treatise on Krishna, cites later age compilations such as the \"Narayana Upanishad\" but never cites this verse of the Chandogya Upanishad. Other scholars disagree that the Krishna mentioned along with Devika in the ancient Upanishad is unrelated to the later Hindu god of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" fame. For example, Archer states that the coincidence of the two names appearing together in the same Upanishad verse cannot be dismissed easily.\n\nYāska's \"Nirukta\", an etymological dictionary published around the 6thcenturyBCE, contains a reference to the Shyamantaka jewel in the possession of Akrura, a motif from the well-known Puranic story about Krishna. Shatapatha Brahmana and \"Aitareya-Aranyaka\" associate Krishna with his Vrishni origins.\n\nIn \"Ashṭādhyāyī\", authored by the ancient grammarian Pāṇini (probably belonged to the 5th or 6thcenturyBCE), \"Vāsudeva\", son of Vasudeva, and \"Arjuna\", as recipients of worship, are referred to together in the same \"sutra\".\nMegasthenes, a Greek ethnographer and an ambassador of Seleucus I to the court of Chandragupta Maurya towards the end of 4thcenturyBCE, made reference to Herakles in his famous work Indica. This text is now lost to history, but was quoted in secondary literature by later Greeks such as Arrian, Diodorus, and Strabo. According to these texts, Megasthenes mentioned that the Sourasenoi tribe of India, who worshipped Herakles, had two major cities named Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river named the Jobares. According to Edwin Bryant, a professor of Indian religions known for his publications on Krishna, \"there is little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the Yadu dynasty to which Krishna belonged\". The word Herakles, states Bryant, is likely a Greek phonetic equivalent of Hari-Krishna, as is Methora of Mathura, Kleisobora of Krishnapura, and the Jobares of Jamuna. Later, when Alexander the Great launched his campaign in the northwest Indian subcontinent, his associates recalled that the soldiers of Porus were carrying an image of Herakles.\n\nThe Buddhist Pali canon and the Ghata-Jâtaka (No.454) polemically mention the devotees of Vâsudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities and may be a garbled and confused version of the Krishna legends. The texts of Jainism mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about Tirthankaras. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient Buddhist and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important in the religious landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of ancient India.\n\nAround 180 BCE the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage bearing images of deities that are now interpreted as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India. The deities displayed on the coins appear to be Vishnu's avatars Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vasudeva-Krishna with attributes of the Shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress on top of the deity is actually a misrepresentation of a shaft with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).\nThe ancient Sanskrit grammarian Patanjali in his \"Mahabhashya\" makes several references to Krishna and his associates found in later Indian texts. In his commentary on Pāṇini's verse 3.1.26, he also uses the word \"Kamsavadha\" or the \"killing of Kamsa\", an important part of the legends surrounding Krishna.\n\nA pillar with a Brahmi script inscription was discovered by colonial era archaeologists in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Using modern techniques, it has been dated to between 125 and 100BCE, and traced to an Indo-Greek who served as an ambassador of the Greek king Antialcidas to a regional Indian king. Named after the Indo-Greek, it is now known as the Heliodorus pillar. Its inscription is a dedication to \"Vasudeva\", another name for Krishna in the Indian tradition. Scholars consider the \"Vasudeva\" to be referring to a deity, because the inscription states that it was constructed by \"the \"Bhagavata\" Heliodorus\" and that it is a \"\"Garuda\" pillar\" (both are Vishnu-Krishna-related terms). Additionally, the inscription includes a Krishna-related verse from chapter11.7 of the \"Mahabharata\" stating that the path to immortality and heaven is to correctly live a life of three virtues: self-temperance (\"damah\"), generosity (\"cagah\" or \"tyaga\"), and vigilance (\"apramadah\").\n\nThe Heliodorus inscription is not an isolated evidence. Three Hathibada inscriptions and one Ghosundi inscription, all located in the state of Rajasthan and dated by modern methodology to the 1stcenturyBCE, mention Samkarsana and Vasudeva, also mention that the structure was built for their worship. These four inscriptions are notable for being some of the oldest-known Sanskrit inscriptions.\n\nA Mora stone slab found at the Mathura-Vrindavan archaeological site in Uttar Pradesh, held now in the Mathura Museum, has a Brahmi inscription. It is dated to the 1stcenturyCE and lists five Vrishni heroes: Balarama, Krishna, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and Samba. Another terracotta plaque from the same site shows an infant being carried by an adult over his head, similar to the legend about Krishna's birth.\n\nMany Puranas tell Krishna's life story or some highlights from it. Two Puranas, the \"Bhagavata Purana\" and the \"Vishnu Purana\", contain the most elaborate telling of Krishna's story, but the life stories of Krishna in these and other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, has been the most popular and widely studied part of this text.\n\nThis summary is a mythological account, based on literary details from the \"Mahābhārata\", the \"Harivamsa\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Vishnu Purana\". The scenes from the narrative are set in ancient India, mostly in the present states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, and Gujarat. The legends about Krishna's life are called \"Krishna charitas\" (IAST: Kṛṣṇacaritas).\n\nIn \"Krishna Charitas\", Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, King Vasudeva of the Yadava clan in Mathura. Devaki's brother is a tyrant named Kansa. At Devaki's wedding, according to Puranic legends, Kansa is told by fortune tellers that a child of Devaki would kill him. Kansa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kansa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Durga, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda Baba and his wife Yasoda near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.\n\n \nThe legends of Krishna's childhood and youth describe him as a cow herder, a mischievous boy whose pranks earns him the nickname a \"Makhan Chor\" (butter thief), and a protector who steals the hearts of the people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna lifts the Govardhana hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from devastating rains and floods.\nOther legends describe him as an enchanter and playful lover of the gopis (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, especially Radha. These metaphor-filled love stories are known as the \"Rasa lila\" and were romanticised in the poetry of Jayadeva, author of the Gita Govinda. They are also central to the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping Radha Krishna.\nKrishna's childhood illustrates the Hindu concept of \"lila\", playing for fun and enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to the banks of the Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the \"prakṛti\" matter and the impermanent body.\n\nThis \"lila\" is a constant theme in the legends of Krishna's childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts as if he were playing a game. This quality of playfulness in Krishna is celebrated during festivals as Rasa-lila and Janmashtami, where Hindus in some regions such as Maharashtra playfully mimic his legends, such as by making human gymnastic pyramids to break open \"handis\" (clay pots) hung high in the air to \"steal\" butter or buttermilk, spilling it all over the group.\n\nKrishna legends then describe his return to Mathura. He overthrows and kills the tyrant king, \"his uncle\" Kansa after quelling several assassination attempts by Kansa. He reinstates Kansa's father, Ugrasena, as the king of the Yadavas and becomes a leading prince at the court. In one version of the Krishna story, as narrated by Shanta Rao, Krishna after Kansa's death leads the Yadavas to the newly built city of Dwaraka. Thereafter Pandavas rise. Krishna befriends Arjuna and the other Pandava princes of the Kuru kingdom. Krishna plays a key role in the \"Mahabharata\".\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes eight wives of Krishna that appear in sequence as (Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Nagnajiti (also called Satya), Bhadra, and Lakshmana (also called Madra). According to Dennis Hudson, this is a metaphor where each of the eight wives signifies a different aspect of him. According to George Williams, Vaishnava texts mention all Gopis as wives of Krishna, but this is spiritual symbolism of devotional relationship and Krishna's complete loving devotion to each and everyone devoted to him. His wife is sometimes called Rohini, Radha, Rukmini, Svaminiji or others. In Krishna-related Hindu traditions, he is most commonly seen with Radha. All of his wives and his lover Radha are considered in the Hindu tradition to be the avatars of the goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Gopis are considered as Radha's many forms and manifestations.\n\nAccording to the epic poem \"Mahabharata\", Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, but on the condition that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his \"Gandiv\" (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\nIt is stated in the Indian texts that the legendary Kurukshetra War leads to the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. After Duryodhana's death, Krishna visits Gandhari to offer his condolences when Gandhari and Drutarashtra visited Kurukshtra, as stated in Stree Parva. Feeling that Krishna deliberately did not put an end to the war, in a fit of rage and sorrow Gandhari said, 'Thou were indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other, therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen !' According to the \"Mahabharata\", a fight breaks out at a festival among the Yadavas, who end up killing each other. Mistaking the sleeping Krishna for a deer, a hunter named Jara shoots an arrow that fatally injures him. Krishna forgives Jara and dies. The pilgrimage (\"tirtha\") site of Bhalka in Gujarat marks the location where Krishna is believed to have died. It is also known as \"Dehotsarga\", states Diana L. Eck, a term that literally means the place where Krishna \"gave up his body\". The \"Bhagavata Purana\" in Book 11, chapter 31 states that after his death, Krishna returned to his transcendent abode directly because of his yogic concentration. Waiting gods such as Brahma and Indra were unable to trace the path Krishna took to leave his human incarnation and return to his abode.\n\nThere are numerous versions of Krishna's life story, of which three are most studied: the \"Harivamsa\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Vishnu Purana\". They share the basic storyline but vary significantly in their specifics, details, and styles. The most original composition, the \"Harivamsa\" is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna's life as a poor herder but weaves in poetic and allusive fantasy. It ends on a triumphal note, not with the death of Krishna. Differing in some details, the fifth book of the \"Vishnu Purana\" moves away from \"Harivamsa\" realism and embeds Krishna in mystical terms and eulogies. The \"Vishnu Purana\" manuscripts exist in many versions.\n\nThe tenth and eleventh books of the \"Bhagavata Purana\" are widely considered to be a poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the \"Harivamsa\". Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (\"lila\"), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in \"Harivamsa\", but is a symbolic universe in the \"Bhagavata Purana\", where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.\n\nThe date of Krishna's birth is celebrated every year as Janmashtami. \n\nAccording to Guy Beck, \"most scholars of Hinduism and Indian history accept the historicity of Krishna - that he was a real male person, whether human or divine, who lived on Indian soil by at least 1000 BCE and interacted with many other historical persons within the cycles of the epic and puranic histories.\" Yet, Beck also notes that there is an \"enormous number of contradictions and discrepancies surrounding the chronology of Krishna's life as depicted in the Sanskrit canon.\"\n\nLanvanya Vemsani states that Krishna can be inferred to have lived between 3227 BCE - 3102 BCE from the Puranas. A number of scholars, such as A. K. Bansal, B. V. Raman places Krishna's birth year as 3228 BCE. A paper presented in a conference in 2004 by a group of archaeologists, religious scholars and astronomers from Somnath Trust of Gujarat, which was organised at Prabhas Patan, the supposed location of the where Krishna spent his last moments, fixes the death of Sri Krishna on 18 February 3102 BC at the age of 125 years and 7 months. \n\nIn contrast, according to mythologies in the Jain tradition, Krishna was a cousin of Neminatha, the 22nd Tirthankara of the Jains. Neminatha is believed in the Jain tradition to have been born 84,000 years before the 9th-centuryBCE Parshvanatha.\n\nA wide range of theological and philosophical ideas are presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. Ramanuja, a Hindu theologian whose works were influential in Bhakti movement, presented him in terms of qualified monism (Vishishtadvaita). Madhvacharya, a Hindu philosopher whose works led to the founding of Haridasa sect of Vaishnavism, presented Krishna in the framework of dualism (Dvaita). Jiva Goswami, a saint from Gaudiya Vaishnava school, described Krishna theology in terms of Bhakti yoga and Achintya Bheda Abheda. Krishna theology is presented in a pure monism (advaita, called \"shuddhadvaita\") framework by Vallabha Acharya, who was the founder of Pushti sect of vaishnavism. Madhusudana Sarasvati, an India philosopher, presented Krishna theology in nondualism-monism framework (Advaita Vedanta), while Adi Shankara, who is credited for unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism, mentioned Krishna in his early eighth-century discussions on Panchayatana puja.\n\nThe \"Bhagavata Purana\", a popular text on Krishna considered to be like a scripture in Assam, synthesizes an Advaita, Samkhya, and Yoga framework for Krishna but one that proceeds through loving devotion to Krishna. Bryant describes the synthesis of ideas in Bhagavata Purana as,\n\nWhile Sheridan and Pintchman both affirm Bryant's view, the latter adds that the Vedantic view emphasized in the Bhagavata is non-dualist with a difference. In conventional nondual Vedanta all reality is an interconnected and one, the Bhagavata posits that the reality is interconnected and plural.\n\nAcross the various theologies and philosophies, the common theme presents Krishna as the essence and symbol of divine love, with human life and love as a reflection of the divine. The longing and love-filled legends of Krishna and the gopis, his playful pranks as a baby, as well as his later dialogues with other characters, are philosophically treated as metaphors for the human longing for the divine and for meaning, and the play between the universals and the human soul. Krishna's \"lila\" is a theology of love-play. According to John Koller, \"love is presented not simply as a means to salvation, it is the highest life\". Human love is God's love.\n\nOther texts that include Krishna such as the \"Bhagavad Gita\" have attracted numerous \"bhasya\" (commentaries) in the Hindu traditions. Though only a part of the Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\", it has functioned as an independent spiritual guide. It allegorically raises through Krishna and Arjuna the ethical and moral dilemmas of human life, then presents a spectrum of answers, weighing in on the ideological questions on human freedoms, choices, and responsibilities towards self and towards others. This Krishna dialogue has attracted numerous interpretations, from being a metaphor of inner human struggle teaching non-violence, to being a metaphor of outer human struggle teaching a rejection of quietism to persecution.\n\nThe worship of Krishna is part of Vaishnavism, a major tradition within Hinduism. Krishna is considered a full avatar of Vishnu, or one with Vishnu himself. However, the exact relationship between Krishna and Vishnu is complex and diverse, with Krishna sometimes considered an independent deity and supreme. Vaishnavas accept many incarnations of Vishnu, but Krishna is particularly important. Their theologies are generally centered either on Vishnu or an avatar such as Krishna as supreme. The terms Krishnaism and Vishnuism have sometimes been used to distinguish the two, the former implying that Krishna is the transcendent Supreme Being.\n\nAll Vaishnava traditions recognise Krishna as the eighth avatar of Vishnu; others identify Krishna with Vishnu, while traditions such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Vallabha Sampradaya and the Nimbarka Sampradaya regard Krishna as the \"Svayam Bhagavan\", the original form of Lord or the same as the concept of Brahman in Hinduism. Gitagovinda of Jayadeva considers Krishna to be the supreme lord while the ten incarnations are his forms. Swaminarayan, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampraday, also worshipped Krishna as God himself. \"Greater Krishnaism\" corresponds to the second and dominant phase of Vaishnavism, revolving around the cults of the Vasudeva, Krishna, and Gopala of the late Vedic period. Today the faith has a significant following outside of India as well.\n\nThe deity \"Krishna-Vasudeva\" (\"\" \"Krishna, the son of Vasudeva\") is historically one of the earliest forms of worship in Krishnaism and Vaishnavism. It is believed to be a significant tradition of the early history of Krishna religion in antiquity. Thereafter, there was an amalgamation of various similar traditions. These include ancient Bhagavatism, the cult of Gopala, of \"Krishna Govinda\" (cow-finding Krishna), of Balakrishna (baby Krishna) and of \"Krishna Gopivallabha\" (Krishna the lover). According to Andre Couture, the Harivamsa contributed to the synthesis of various characters as aspects of Krishna.\n\nThe use of the term bhakti, meaning devotion, is not confined to any one deity. However, Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, particularly among the Vaishnava sects. Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the concept of \"lila\", meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\nThe bhakti movements devoted to Krishna became prominent in southern India in the 7th to 9thcenturies CE. The earliest works included those of the Alvar saints of the Tamil country. A major collection of their works is the \"Divya Prabandham\". The Alvar Andal's popular collection of songs Tiruppavai, in which she conceives of herself as a gopi, is the most famous of the oldest works in this genre.\nThe movement originated in South India during the 7thCE, spreading northwards from Tamil Nadu through Karnataka and Maharashtra; by the 15thcentury, it was established in Bengal and northern India. Early Bhakti pioneers include Nimbarka (12th or 13thcentury CE), but most emerged later, including Vallabhacharya (15thcentury CE) and (Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. They started their own schools, namely Nimbarka Sampradaya, Vallabha Sampradaya, and Gaudiya Vaishnavism, with Krishna as the supreme god.\n\nIn the Deccan, particularly in Maharashtra, saint poets of the Varkari sect such as Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Janabai, Eknath, and Tukaram promoted the worship of Vithoba, a local form of Krishna, from the beginning of the 13thcentury until the late 18thcentury. In southern India, Purandara Dasa and Kanakadasa of Karnataka composed songs devoted to the Krishna image of Udupi. Rupa Goswami of Gaudiya Vaishnavism has compiled a comprehensive summary of bhakti called Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu.\n\nIn South India, the acharyas of the Sri Sampradaya have written reverentially about Krishna in most of their works, including the Thiruppavai by Andal and Gopala Vimshati by Vedanta Desika.\n\nTamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala states have many major Krishna temples, and Janmashtami is one of the widely celebrated festivals in South India.\n\nBy 1965 the \"Krishna-bhakti\" movement had spread outside India after Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (as instructed by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura) traveled from his homeland in West Bengal to New York City. A year later in 1966, after gaining many followers, he was able to form the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The purpose of this movement was to write about Krishna in English and to share the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy with people in the Western world by spreading the teachings of the saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the biographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the mantra he received when he was given diksha or initiation in Gaya was the six-word verse of the \"Kali-Santarana Upanishad\", namely \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare; Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare\". In Gaudiya tradition, it is the \"maha-mantra\", or great mantra, about Krishna bhakti. Its chanting was known as \"hari-nama sankirtana\".\n\nThe \"maha-mantra\" gained the attention of George Harrison and John Lennon of The Beatles fame, and Harrison produced a 1969 recording of the mantra by devotees from the London Radha Krishna Temple. Titled \"Hare Krishna Mantra\", the song reached the top twenty on the UK music charts and was also successful in West Germany and Czechoslovakia. The mantra of the Upanishad thus helped bring Bhaktivedanta and ISKCON ideas about Krishna into the West. ISCKON has built many Krishna temples in the West, as well as other locations such as South Africa.\n\nKrishna is found in southeast Asian history and art, but to a far less extent than Shiva, Durga, Nandi, Agastya, and Buddha. In temples (\"candi\") of the archaeological sites in hilly volcanic Java, Indonesia, temple reliefs do not portray his pastoral life or his role as the erotic lover, nor do the historic Javanese Hindu texts. Rather, either his childhood or the life as a king and Arjuna's companion have been more favored. The most elaborate temple arts of Krishna are found in a series of \"Krsnayana\" reliefs in the Prambanan Hindu temple complex near Yogyakarta. These are dated to the 9thcentury CE. Krishna remained a part of the Javanese cultural and theological fabric through the 14thcentury, as evidenced by the 14th-century Penataran reliefs along with those of the Hindu god Rama in east Java, before Islam replaced Buddhism and Hinduism on the island.\n\nThe medieval era arts of Vietnam and Cambodia feature Krishna. The earliest surviving sculptures and reliefs are from the 6th and 7thcentury, and these include Vaishnavism iconography. According to John Guy, the curator and director of southeast Asian arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Krishna Govardhana art from 6th/7th-century Vietnam at Danang, and 7th-century Cambodia at Phnom Da cave in Angkor Borei, are some of the most sophisticated of this era.\n\nKrishna iconography has also been found in Thailand, along with those of Surya and Vishnu. For example, a large number of sculptures and icons have been found in the SiThep and Klangnai sites in the Phetchabun region of northern Thailand. These are dated to about the 7th and 8thcentury, from both the Funan and Zhenla periods archaeological sites.\n\nIndian dance and music theatre traces its origins and techniques to the ancient \"Sama Veda\" and \"Natyasastra\" texts. The stories enacted and the numerous choreographic themes are inspired by the mythologies and legends in Hindu texts, including Krishna-related literature such as \"Harivamsa\" and \"Bhagavata Purana\".\n\nThe Krishna stories have played a key role in the history of Indian theatre, music, and dance, particularly through the tradition of \"Rasaleela\". These are dramatic enactments of Krishna's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. One common scene involves Krishna playing flute in rasa leela, only to be heard by certain gopis (cowheard maidens), which is theologically supposed to represent divine call only heard by certain enlightened beings. Some of the text's legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in Gita Govinda.\n\nKrishna-related literature such as the \"Bhagavata Purana\" accords a metaphysical significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of \"Krishna Lila\" is an act of remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of \"para bhakti\" (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.\n\nClassical dance styles such as Kathak, Odissi, Manipuri, Kuchipudi and Bharatnatyam in particular are known for their Krishna-related performances. Krisnattam (Krishnattam) traces its origins to Krishna legends, and is linked to another major classical Indian dance form called Kathakali. Bryant summarizes the influence of Krishna stories in the \"Bhagavata Purana\" as, \"[it] has inspired more derivative literature, poetry, drama, dance, theatre and art than any other text in the history of Sanskrit literature, with the possible exception of the \"Ramayana\".\n\nThe Jainism tradition lists 63 \"Śalākāpuruṣa\" or notable figures which, amongst others, includes the twenty-four \"Tirthankaras\" (spiritual teachers) and nine sets of triads. One of these triads is Krishna as the \"Vasudeva\", Balarama as the \"Baladeva\", and Jarasandha as the \"Prati-Vasudeva\". In each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a \"Vasudeva\" with an elder brother termed the \"Baladeva\". Between the triads, \"Baladeva\" upholds the principle of non-violence, a central idea of Jainism. The villain is the \"Prati-vasudeva\", who attempts to destroy the world. To save the world, \"Vasudeva-Krishna\" has to forsake the non-violence principle and kill the \"Prati-Vasudeva\". The stories of these triads can be found in the \"Harivamsa Purana\" (8thcentury CE) of Jinasena (not be confused with its namesake, the addendum to \"Mahābhārata\") and the \"Trishashti-shalakapurusha-charita\" of Hemachandra.\n\nThe story of Krishna's life in the \"Puranas\" of Jainism follows the same general outline as those in the Hindu texts, but in details they are very different: they include Jain \"Tirthankaras\" as characters in the story, and generally are polemically critical of Krishna, unlike the versions found in the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Vishnu Purana\". For example, Krishna loses battles in the Jain versions, and his \"gopis\" and his clan of Yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named Dvaipayana. Similarly, after dying from the hunter Jara's arrow, the Jaina texts state Krishna goes to the third hell in Jain cosmology, while his brother is said to go to the sixth heaven.\n\nVimalasuri is attributed to be the author of the Jain version of the \"Harivamsa Purana\", but no manuscripts have been found that confirm this. It is likely that later Jain scholars, probably Jinasena of the 8thcentury, wrote a complete version of Krishna legends in the Jain tradition and credited it to the ancient Vimalasuri. Partial and older versions of the Krishna story are available in Jain literature, such as in the \"Antagata Dasao\" of the \"Svetambara\" \"Agama\" tradition.\n\nIn other Jain texts, Krishna is stated to be a cousin of the twenty-second \"Tirthankara\", Neminatha. The Jain texts state that Naminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the \"Bhagavad Gita\". According to Jeffery D. Long, a professor of religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the \"Bhagavad Gita\" as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.\n\nThe story of Krishna occurs in the Jataka tales in Buddhism. The \"Vidhurapandita Jataka\" mentions \"Madhura\" (Sanskrit: Mathura), the \"Ghata Jataka\" mentions Kamsa, Devagabbha (Sk: Devaki), Upasagara or Vasudeva, Govaddhana (Sk: Govardhana), Baladeva (Balarama), and Kanha or Kesava (Sk: Krishna, Keshava).\n\nLike the Jaina versions of the Krishna legends, the Buddhist versions such as one in \"Ghata Jataka\" follow the general outline of the story, but are different from the Hindu versions as well. For example, the Buddhist legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole, after she is born, so no future husband could reach her. Krishna's father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. The siblings of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries. In the Buddhist version of the legend, all of Krishna's siblings grow to maturity.\n\nKrishna and his siblings' capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna interaction is missing in the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by the hand of a hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.\n\nAt the end of this \"Ghata-Jataka\" discourse, the Buddhist text declares that Sariputta, one of the revered disciples of the Buddha in the Buddhist tradition, was incarnated as Krishna in his previous life to learn lessons on grief from the Buddha in his prior rebirth:\n\nWhile the Buddhist Jataka texts co-opt Krishna-Vasudeva and make him a student of the Buddha in his previous life, the Hindu texts co-opt the Buddha and make him an avatar of Vishnu. The 'divine boy' Krishna as an embodiment of wisdom and endearing prankster forms a part of the pantheon of gods in Japanese Buddhism.\n\nKrishna is mentioned as \"Krishna Avtar\" in the Chaubis Avtar, a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to Guru Gobind Singh.\n\nBahá'ís believe that Krishna was a \"Manifestation of God\", or one in a line of prophets who have revealed the Word of God progressively for a gradually maturing humanity. In this way, Krishna shares an exalted station with Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Muhammad, Jesus, the Báb, and the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nAhmadiyya, a 20th century Islamic movement, consider Krishna as one of their ancient prophets. Ghulam Ahmad stated that he was himself a prophet in the likeness of prophets such as Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad, who had come to earth as a latter-day reviver of religion and morality.\n\nKrishna worship or reverence has been adopted by several new religious movements since the 19thcentury, and he is sometimes a member of an eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures. For instance, Édouard Schuré, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and occult movements, considered Krishna a \"Great Initiate\", while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual teacher for humanity along with Buddha.\n\nKrishna was canonised by Aleister Crowley and is recognised as a saint of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica in the Gnostic Mass of Ordo Templi Orientis.\n\n\n\n"}

She has lived in exile in the United States since 1979.\n\nHaving founded and headed several international non-governmental organizations focused on advancing the status of women, Afkhami has been an advocate of women's rights since the 1970s. She has lectured and published extensively on the international women's movement, women's human rights, women in leadership, women and technology, the status of women in Muslim-majority societies and on women's participation in civil society-building and democratization. Her books have been translated into multiple languages and distributed internationally.\n\nAt 17, Afkhami joined a trade union and successfully challenged a breach of her rights as a worker when an employer laid her off temporarily then rehired her to avoid paying for the vacation she had earned. She credits this incident with giving her the belief that organizing could bring about social change.\n\nIn 1975, Afkhami was asked to join the cabinet of the Iranian government and became Minister of Women's Affairs. The post had not existed in Iran before and the only other person holding such a position was Françoise Giroud in France.\n\nIn 2001, Afkhami published Leading to Choices: A Leadership Training Handbook for Women to encourage women to be leaders in their families, communities, and countries. It has been translated into 20 languages. In 2010, she published \"Leading to Action: A Political Participation Handbook for Women\". The manuals have been used for training around the world, reaching thousands.\n\nAfkhami and her sister Farah Abrahimi were featured in the PBS series \"Destination America\" in 2005. At the time Afkhami became Minister of Women's Affairs, her sister was a leader in the students' movement demanding the overthrow of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\n\nIn 1969, two years after returning to Iran as a professor of literature and Chair of the Department of English at the National University of Iran, Afkhami was drawn into Iran's women's movement and founded the Association of University Women.

She remained there for ten years, during which time she worked for Iranian women's rights.\n\nWhile Afkhami was Minister of Women's Affairs, Iran's legislation granted women equal rights as regards divorce; raised the minimum age of marriage; supported women's employment with maternity leave and childcare provision; and built upon the family laws of 1967.\n\nAfkhami has served as a member of Iran's High Council of Family Planning and Welfare and on the boards of trustees of Kerman University and Farah University for Women. She has written that \"[w]omen's empowerment is a process, a holistic approach that involves raising consciousness, building skills and reforming unjust laws that limit women's education, their employment, their participation in decision making and, above all, their opportunities for economic independence.\"\n\nWhen Iran's Islamic Revolution began in 1979, Afkhami was at the United Nations in New York negotiating the establishment of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). She was charged \"in absentia\" with \"Corruption on Earth and warring with God.\" She has never returned to Iran, living instead in exile, although she has said she would like to return to help rebuild Iran if its political system changed.\n\nShe contributed the piece \"A future in the past, the prerevolutionary women's movement\" to the 1984 anthology \"\", edited by Robin Morgan.\nIn 1994, she published \"Women in Exile\", a collection of portraits of activist women in political exile.\n\nAfkhami then joined the international women's rights movement, saying: \"The conditions women have in common outrank and outvalue those that set them apart.\" She became an advisor to Human Rights Watch and the Vice-President and Executive Director of [The Sisterhood is Global?]. Since then, she has written \"Towards Global Feminism\".\n\nAfkhami has served on a number of boards and committees of international organizations including the Steering Committee of the World Movement for Democracy (1999-2010), the International League for Human Rights (2000-2006), the Global Fund for Women (1998-2007), Gender At Work (2003-2008), Women Leaders Intercultural Forum (2010) and Global Women's Action Network for Children (2006-2009)., Global Fund for Women (1998-2007), International Museum of Women (2000-2014), Realizing Rights: The Ethical Globalization Initiative (2002-2010), and Women's Human Rights Net (2000-2004).\n\nShe currently serves on the Advisory Committee of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch, the Board of the Foundation for Iranian Studies, and the Board of Trustees for the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery\n\nAfkhami believes that religion and feminism are not incompatible (\"Women ought not to be forced to choose between freedom and God\"). Nonetheless, culture and religion can be problematic in terms of women's human rights: \"We must pose the question: why is it that the denial of the most rudimentary rights to civil treatment for women is always based on some fundamental point of culture? Is this culture real, or is it a fetish that is used to maintain some economic, social, or simply psychological privilege?\"\n\nShe has taken a stand against cultural relativism and Islamic exceptionalism, stating clearly that human rights are universal and must supersede religious frameworks: \"At the center of [the] conflict is the dilemma of Muslim women's human rights – whether Muslim women have rights because they are human beings, or whether they have rights because they are Muslim women.\"\n\nLooking back on the changes which occurred in Iran just before the revolution, Afkhami said: \"It seems to me that our main mistake was not that we did not do other things which we should have done. Our main mistake was that we created conditions in which the contradictions related to modernity, progress, equality, and human rights, especially women's rights, increased and the reaction to our work put perhaps too much pressure on the country's social fabric.\" She has publicly supported the Iranian One Million Signatures campaign to end discriminatory laws against women by promoting a book written by Iranian activist Noushin Ahmadi Khorasani. She believes that the movement is a new phase within a century-long cause.\n\nAfkhami's life and work in the women's movement in Iran, breaking with tradition, and living in exile are the topics of the 2012 \"Voice of America Persian biopic.\n\nChicago Council on Global Affairs, \"Election 2016 and the Global Women's Movement\", Chicago, IL (November 1, 2016) (Moderated by Fay Hartog-Levin with Catherine Bertini and Ellen Chesler.)\n\nRoosevelt Institute, \"Women and Girls Rising Conference\", New York, NY (September 11, 2014) (Moderated by LaShawn R.

{"id": "8715240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8715240", "title": "Malek Boutih", "text": "Malek Boutih\n\nAbdelmalek \"Malek\" Boutih (; born 27 October 1964) is a French retired politician and activist who served as a member of the National Assembly from 2012 to 2017, representing the Essonne department. He previously was the Socialist Party's National Secretary for Social Issues (French: \"Secrétaire national chargé des questions de société\") from 2003 to 2008.\n\nHe also has had a long association with SOS Racisme, a civil rights organisation with close ties to the Socialist Party. He joined in 1984 while a student at the University of Nanterre and served as Vice President from 1985 to 1992 and as President from 1999 to 2003. Boutih is known for his honesty and generosity; he is appreciated on both sides of the aisle for his patriotism and frankness. President Nicolas Sarkozy asked him to enter the French Government in 2007 but he refused, preferring to focus on his social activism.\n\nMalek Boutih was born in a clinic in the wealthy neighbourhood of Neuilly-sur-Seine, although his family did not live there. He later chose to return to Neuilly-sur-Seine to attend La Folie-Saint-James high school (\"lycée\"). He was born of Algerian parents from Kabylie. His father was an FLN sympathiser and after independence, his parents went to France seeking work. His father worked in the building industry and his mother as a cleaner. At the age of 9 months old he contracted poliomyelitis while his family was living in the slums of Nanterre, and later, Boulogne-Billancourt. He endured multiple operations until the age of 12 years. As a Deputy, he gave financial support to the Antony rehabilitation centre where he was cared for as a child.\n\nAt the beginning of his study of Law at the University of Nanterre and at the \"École supérieure de journalism de Paris\", he became involved in activism and community work. In 1983 he took part in the March for Equality and Against Racism. Joining SOS Racisme in 1984, he became its vice-president from 1985 to 1992 and founded the Grigny \"Maison des Potes\" (\"mate's house\" — emergency accommodation) and the \"Banlieues du Monde\" association. He was editor-in-chief of the newspaper \"Pote à Pote\" (\"Mate to Mate\") for several years.\n\nOn 6 February 1990, he appeared on the TV talk show \"Ciel, mon mardi !\", a program that specialised in confrontation between people with opposing views.\n\nHis time as head of SOS Racisme was marked by the creation of the discrimination test and the first convictions in cases against racial discrimination in employment, housing and entry to night clubs. His greatest triumph being the validation of the use of discrimination tests by the Court of Cassation. In the fight against racism and its rooks, he focussed on education at tackled urban ghettos with two priorities: mixing the population and fighting against violence. Finally, in 2002 he was one of the first to sound the alarm on the rise of anti-semitism in France, in the guise of anti-Zionism.\n\nA regular critic of its elder, rival anti-racism organisation MRAP, in 2003 Malek Boutih declared \"that there are several kinds of anti-racism in France, notable that of MRAP who march to cries of 'Death to the Jews!'\". In September 2006, he was convicted, fined €1,000 and order to pay €1 damages by the Paris \"tribunal correctionel\" for defamation of MRAP.\n\nHe takes a position against separatism, ghetto mentality and positive discrimination. He states:\n\nSince the Treaty of Lisbon came into force on 1 December 2009, there has been a legal basis for the protection of minorities in Europe and hence in France.\n\nFor Malek Boutih, the children of immigrants have taken root in French society. They are French. To affirm that national identity is a sort of political rallying cry for that generation. Thus he hopes to persuade young people who are French, but have been convinced by the signals they are given (they are blacks, they are Arabs [\"Beurs\"]…) that they are not French, indeed they cannot even claim to be. According to him, France must finally recognize that integration has well and truly taken place and the country is now of mixed blood. He condemns religious extremism.\n\nDuring his time as head of SOS Racisme, he conducted an ongoing fight against violence in poor suburbs which he branded \"self-destructive and nihilist\" in his \"Propositions pour un véritable Plan Marshall pour les Banlieues\" (\"Proposals for a real Marshall Plan for the Suburbs\") because it was preventing the emancipation of a generation and could only end in failure. He refused to support violence as being the only response to marginalisation and preferred political, trade-union and community actions. Only the political commitment of that generation would allow the spiral of violence to end, according to him, and along with it the ethnic and geographic discrimination they suffered.\n\nA member of the Socialist Party since 1986, when his leadership of SOS Racisme ended he was appointed to the party's national hierarchy at the 2003 Congress of Dijon as National Secretary for Social Issues, a post that did not previously exist, despite never having had an elected position. The post was renewed at the Le Mans Congress in 2005. He had responsibility for immigration, the fight against racism, AIDS and drug addiction.\n\nHe wrote a report on immigration, \"Une nouvelle politique de l'immigration\" (2004) (\"A new politics of immigration\"), called for by the national leadership of the party to define an official line on the subject. His goal was to convince the public that immigration was an essential contribution to France when it was properly controlled and organised. He declared himself in favour of quotas in line with a strategy of codevelopment creating a legal stream of immigration and regulating flows of migrants. This report was distributed by the Socialist Party leadership.\n\nFollowing the Le Mans Congress, faced with a social crisis and questions of national identity, he defended the ideal of a \"mixed-blood Republic\" (\"République métissée\"). According to him, Effectively he believes that the Republic is an idea that cannot remain fixed and that it should lean towards an ideal which \"brings together the tradition of all that is best in French history, Republican history, but which also looks to the future, which accepts France's place in the world, which accepts the new generations of French people, which accepts diversity not as a handicap but as a treasure\".\n\nIn his report on drug addiction, \"Cannabis : contrôler l'usage pour protéger les citoyens\" (2006) (\"Cannabis: Controlling usage to protect citizens\"), Malek Boutih advocates taking public control of the market so as to combat the mafia, cannabis being, according to him, \"the cornerstone of ghettoisation and insecurity in working-class neighbourhoods\". This idea was taken into the platform of the Socialist Party in 2007 in the form of \"public regulation\".\n\nClose to Julien Dray, also a former member of SOS Racisme, he supported Ségolène Royal as Socialist Party candidate in the 2007 French Presidential election. The new President, Nicolas Sarkozy, asked him to join his government, which he refused to do, affirming that there was no question of him \"taking responsibilities in this government\", all the while underlining \"the reciprocal respect\" which characterised his relationship with Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nHe was not reappointed to the National Secretariat of the party in December 2008 and was summoned on 25 January 2009 by Pouria Amirshahi to clarify his attitude after his criticisms of the party's plan for the financial crisis and his numerous accolades of Nicolas Sarkozy. \"Malek Boutih should choose which side he's on.\"\n\nMalek Boutih was chosen as candidate for the Charente's 4th constituency in the 2007 Legislative elections on 1 July 2006 at the national congress of the Socialist Party.\n\nAlmost all of the elected Socialists in the department made publicly known their hostility to his candidature and their willingness to block him since he was parachuted into the position. The First Federal Secretary had effectively organised a consultative vote in the constituency between candidates Martine Pinville and Jeanne Filloux, before Malek Boutih's appointment. Selected by the local party members, Martine Pinville chose to keep her candidature with the official support of the Socialist Party, thus she was excluded at the national committee meeting of 22 May 2007, along with her alternate candidate, the outgoing Socialist deputy Jean-Claude Beauchaud.\n\nBoutih was eliminated in the first round of the elections, coming third with 15.65% of the vote (9.54% of enrolled voters, although 12.5% was needed to progress to the second round), behind the UMP Mayor of Angoulême, Philippe Mottet (35.58% of the vote) and the dissident Socialist Martine Pinville (21.04%, 13% of enrolled voters). Boutih singled out the First Secretary François Hollande, accusing him of \"throwing him to the wolves\". In the second round, the Socialist Party supported Martine Pinville who was elected with 57.03% of the vote.\n\nHe felt that he had been beaten by his own party and severely criticised its leaders \"who formed a clique that disliked society as it was, who cannot see themselves as part of it and who cling to the melancholy of the 1970s. Where we come from it's Good Bye Lenin!\" He rebuked them for having skimmed over the debate on diversity and not having taken it up seriously, like other subjects of real concern to French people: violence, work, the right to social emancipation, identity.\n\nMalek Boutih was chosen as a candidate in Essonne's 10th constituency following a vote of party members. He began his campaign using the words and images of Jean-Luc Mélenchon and in his campaign materials, despite Mélenchon supporting François Delapierre, the candidate for the Left Front in the same constituency. He led in the first round on 10 June 2012 with 34.56% of the vote and was elected on 17 June with 56.84% of the vote against the Radical Party candidate, Marianne Duranton (43.16%).\n\nIn February 2015 the Prime Minister Manuel Valls named Malek Boutih as parliamentarian assigned to consider the analysis and prevention of \"new generations turning to terrorism in connection with jihadist networks\". This report was handed over in June 2015, titled \"Génération radicale\" (\"Radical Generation\"). One of its major conclusions was:\n\nWarmly welcomed by members of the opposition, but more discretely by the Socialist majority, this report was criticised especially for its sources, such as Frigid Barjot and for the prominence granted to Pierre Bellanger, founder and CEO of radio station Skyrock where Boutih worked as Manager of Institutional Relations. For Libération the report \"caricatures young people as thirsty for recognition, radicalised and inured to violence\" and the daily laughs at certain suggestions such as creating \"night clubs run by associations and publicly financed\" to avoid people being turned away.\n\nIn between the two rounds of the Socialist Party Primary to select a Presidential candidate, Malek Boutih vehemently attacked Benoît Hamon maintaining that he would be \"in harmony with an Islamo-Leftist fringe [to whom] he would make a discreet electoral appeal\" and branded him the candidate for \"Indigènes de la République\" (an anti-racist, anti-colonial, anti-Zionist party accused of racism, anti-semitism, homophobia and antifeminism). These remarks divided the supporters of Manuel Valls.\n\nOn 30 March, he announced on Europe 1 that he would support the candidate for En Marche!, Emmanuel Macron, from the first round of the presidential election.\n\nIn anticipation of the 2017 Legislative elections, he sought nomination as a candidate for \"La République en marche !\". The nomination was refused and he competed in the election as an independent. He was eliminated in the first round with 12.39% of the vote.\n\nMalek Boutih is also an administrator of the \"Collège des personnalités qualifiées du Paris Saint-Germain\".\n\nHe is Manager of Institutional Relations at the radio station Skyrock.\n\nHe received the medal of a knight of the National Order of Merit in 2001. In 2003, he received the prize awarded by the Senate for 'political discovery of the year'.\n\nHe personally supports the Geneva Initiative, an alternative peace plan envisaging the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\nIn 2016, he received the \"Prix de la laïcité\" (\"Secular Prize\").\n\n"}

(), was a Spanish Dominican lay sister, mystic and visionary, known popularly as \"La Siervita\" (the Little Servant). She lived a life which was austere and simple, and many miracles were attributed to her, as well as levitation, ecstasy, bilocation, the stigmata, clairvoyance and healing, among others.\n\nDe León died with a reputation for sanctity and is one of the most revered of the natives of the Canary Islands, together with Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur and José de Anchieta. The cause for her canonization has been submitted to the Holy See for review.\n\nDe León was born on March 23, 1643, in the town of El Sauzal, located on the island of Tenerife, one of the Spanish Canary Islands, to Andrés de León y Bello and María Delgado y Perera, a humble family of noble origin, although in decline. She was of possible Guanche ancestry.\n\nShe was their youngest child, having two sisters and a brother. According to the chronicles of the time, she was a woman of delicate features and a sweet face.\n\nFrom an early age, De León showed mystical inclinations, especially in her feelings and great devotion to a miraculous image of the baby Jesus that was in the Church of St. Peter in her hometown. This image supposedly would open the doors of the church for her when she went to pray before it. There was also a laurel tree which would grow only under her care.\n\nWith the death of De León's father in 1646, poverty overtook the family. Around this time, a couple from mainland Spain, who had relocated to the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, where the husband was to practice medicine, had decided that they wanted another child to care for, along with their own child. Her mother, María Delgado, was convinced to give up her daughter by the doctor's wife with the promise of a better life for the child. Two years later, the couple made plans to move to New Spain, with the intention of taking Mary with them. Before this could happen, she was recovered by her birth mother, who had learned of this plan. Delgado, however, died shortly after this, and her daughter was taken in by a good friend of her mother who lived in La Orotava.\n\nWhen De León was reaching her teenage years, two local woman, who had the reputation of leading simple lives, came to her foster mother, with a letter supposedly from the girl's maternal aunt, Catalina Delgado, which said that she and her husband wished to care for the care, and the bearers should accompany her to their farm. They then took her back to the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, where one of them approached a man in a back alley of the city. De León quickly realized that she was in danger and made her escape. She went to her aunt's home, where she was received and cared for by her and her uncle.\n\nLiving there, De León gradually took over the care of the farm, doing the hardest jobs and organizing its operations. She would rise at dawn and spend the entire day at work, never showing signs of fatigue. Her spiritual qualities soon became apparent, as she treasured solitude and embraced the lowliest work. She led a life of strict penance, wearing the simplest clothing and sleeping on the floor. Over time, the farm flourished and her uncle, Miguel Pérez, felt that she should be the one to inherit their land. He drew up a will for this on 23 March 1665. Mary was torn. She felt a desire to live a religious form of life, one in which she could do the most needed work, living in total poverty, without even the dowry her inheritance would have provided. Finally she declared her intention to enter a monastery as a lay sister, a decision which her aunt and uncle accepted.\n\nInitially De León's guardians wanted her to enter the local monastery of the Poor Clares as the servant of their daughter, a choir nun in that community. She chose, however, to enter the monastery of the nuns of the Dominican Second Order, although she originally wanted to belong to the Order of Discalced Carmelites, as she was very devoted to their foundress, St. Teresa of Jesus. As there had not yet been established any monasteries of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in the Canary Islands, De León entered the Dominican Order, due to a mysterious dream she had.\nIn February 1668, De León was admitted to the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine of Siena in San Cristóbal de La Laguna, located next to the Plaza del Adelantado in the center of the city, as a lay sister. There she was to care for an elderly nun of the community, Sister Jacobina de San Jerónimo Suárez, O.P. From that point on she would live within the monastery walls until her death, having never left the cloister. It was during this time that many miracles were attributed to her. One particular episode was one in which a devotional medal with the image of Our Lady of Solitude which she owned was reassembled spontaneously after having been broken into pieces several days before. Another possible episode of levitation was described by other nuns. As with other mystics, De León experienced ecstasy, during which the emission of light could be seen coming from her face. There were also reports of a marked heat emanating from her body, especially when receiving the Eucharist.\n\nDe León had a great friendship with the famous pirate Amaro Rodríguez Felipe, popularly known as the corsair \"Amaro Pargo\", whose sister was also a lay sister in the monastery and who shared a cell with De León. The privateer claimed to have experienced a great miracle through De León. Pargo recounted that he was assaulted by an individual when he was in Cuba. At the very instant when the attacker would have plunged his dagger into the body of the pirate, the figure of De León appeared, interceding and preventing Pargo's death. This phenomenon, known as ubiquity or bilocation, and associated with many saints, is the capacity to be in two places simultaneously.\n\nDe León also had a great friendship with the Franciscan friar and mystic Fray Juan de Jesús, who was her spiritual director and who gave her much counsel in pursuing the spiritual life.\n\nDe León died in monastery cloister on 15 February 1731, having lived within its walls for 63 years without leaving. Before her death, she fell into an ecstasy and died keeping a pulse and the pupils of her eyes clear for more than 24 hours. In her side, next to her heart, was found a wound, such as the one which would have been left by the side of Christ. Three years later her body was exhumed and was found incorrupt, whole and flexible. Her palate and tongue were preserved fresh and rosy, and jasmine-scented blood issued from her mouth.\n\nDe León's incorrupt body is still preserved in the Monastery of St. Catherine, where she lived out her life and died. Every 15 February (the anniversary of her death), her body is placed on public display in a glass-covered coffin, which was donated by the pirate Amaro Pargo, who was present at the exhumation. Because of the large numbers of pilgrims and devotees who desire to see her incorrupt body, the coffin is also displayed on the following Sunday.\n\nA formal inquiry into De León's life for possible canonization was begun in the 19th century, but soon ceased. The cause was reopened in 1992 and has been submitted to the Vatican. It remains pending. Supporters of her cause are dismayed by this lack of progress, despite a document from 1771 which lists 1,251 miracles attributed to her intercession.\n\nAlthough she has not yet been officially canonized, veneration of Sister Mary of Jesus has become the equivalent in the Canary Islands in cult of Saint Teresa of Jesus in the rest of Spain, Saint Catherine of Siena in Italy and Saint Rose of Lima in Peru and Latin America.\n\nMiracles associated with De León are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is best remembered for her work as a social and political activist for the YWCA in China from 1917 to 1943. Returning to New York, she served as the executive director of the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy from 1946 to 1951 and contributed to the journal \"Far East Reporter\" from 1953 until her death from lung cancer in 1989.\n\nRussell was outspoken on the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s and wrote many works and articles documenting it. In 1971, she was one of the inaugural members of the United States-China People's Friendship Association.\n\nOf British and Scottish descent, Russell was born in Hayward, California. Her parents were Thomas Russell and Lelia May (née Smalley); siblings included Jean, Thomas, Lloyd, Lelia, and David. Russell studied at University of California, Berkeley, where she began her affiliation with the Young Women's Christian Association, and here she met Mary Ingle Bentley (1878–1940), who became her life companion. She studied for her master's degree at Columbia University.\n\nRussell arrived in China in 1917. Upon arrival, she studied the language in Nanjing, and was subsequently appointed by the YWCA at a post in Changsha in Hunan. She worked in Changsha from 1919 to 1924, and later from 1928 to 1930, and again in 1932 to 1933. When Changsha was invaded by the revolutionary army of Chiang Kai-shek in 1930, Russell refused to leave the city and was mistakenly thought to have perished; a memorial service was held for her.\n\nDuring the 1930s, a turbulent and dangerous time to work in China during civil war and war with Japan, she worked mainly at the headquarters of the YWCA in Shanghai. She participated in a Marxist study group which included the likes of Rewi Alley, Lily Haass, Talitha Gerlach and Cora Deng.\n\nRussell departed China in 1943, and began working for the YWCA in Passaic, New Jersey the following year. She was appointed executive director of the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy in 1946, which she held for 6 years. In 1953, Russell began lecturing on contemporary China and began working on a self-published journal, \"Far East Reporter\", which she contributed to until her death in 1989. The \"Far East Reporter\" was described as a \"magazine devoted to friendship and better understanding between the people of the U.S. and China\".\n\nIn the early 1950s, she was accused of being a member of the Communist Party and was called to appear before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. \"The New York Times\" writes that she \"invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against involuntary self-incrimination when asked if she was a member\". Russell was outspoken on the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s and wrote many works and articles documenting it. She pointed out that the \"Chinese view the Cultural Revolution as a protracted struggle requiring many campaigns and revolutions in the cultural sphere, but that they are confident of victory and place their hope in China's young people, the tens of millions who will carry on the struggle\". In New York in the summer of 1971, Russell was one of the inaugural members of the US–China Peoples Friendship Association (USCPFA), and revisited the country in 1972.\n\nShe was diagnosed with lung cancer in early summer 1989 and died at her home in New York on November 8, 1989 at the age of 96. After her death, she was described as a \"truly remarkable person\", who \"led an extraordinary life of social and political activism\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "328642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328642", "title": "Michel Micombero", "text": "Michel Micombero\n\nGeneral Michel Micombero (August 26, 1940 – July 16, 1983) was a Burundian politician and soldier who ruled the country as its first president and \"de facto\" dictator for the decade between 1966 and 1976. He was a member of the Tutsi ethnic group.\n\nBeginning his career as an officer in the Burundian army, Micombero studied in Belgium and rose to prominence for his role in helping to foil an attempted coup d'état in October 1965 where ethnic Hutu soldiers attempted to overthrow the country's (Tutsi) monarchy. After becoming prime minister in July 1966, Micombero led two further coup d'états against the monarchy, which he perceived as too moderate, and installed himself as president in November 1966. \n\nAs President, Micombero ruled Burundi as a military dictator. He led a one-party state which centralised the country's institutions and adopted a neutral stance in the Cold War. Dissent was repressed and, in 1972, an attempt to challenge Micombero's power led to a genocide against the Hutu population in which around 100,000 people, mainly Hutus, were killed. His regime finally collapsed in 1976 when he was ousted in a coup d'état by Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. Micombero went into exile in Somalia where he died in 1983.\n\nMicombero was born in Rutovu, Bururi Province in Belgian-ruled Ruanda-Urundi on 26 August 1940. His parents were peasants from the Hema people, part of the Tutsi ethnic group. Micombero studied at Catholic mission schools in Burundi and, in 1960, joined the Burundian military which was being formed ahead of planned independence in 1962. As part of his training, he was sent to study at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels, Belgium to train as an officer. At the time of the independence of the Kingdom of Burundi in July 1962, he held the rank of captain.\n\nIn early post-independence Burundi, the Tutsi-dominated monarchy of Mwambutsa IV attempted to balance the interests of Tutsi with those of the Hutu majority. In 1963, Micombero joined the ruling Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party which, though dominated by Tutsi, also tried to attract Hutu members. In June, Micombero was named State Secretary for Defense, making him head of the military at the age of 23. In October 1965, a group of ethnic Hutus attempted to overthrow the Burundian monarchy. Their attempt, though unsuccessful, led to Mwambutsa IV fleeing into exile. Micombero led the repression against the coup's perpetrators. In July 1966, a second coup d'état brought the king's son, Ntare V, to power and suspended the national constitution. However, when Ntare was on a state visit to the neighbouring Republic of the Congo in November 1966, a third coup d'état abolished the monarchy and a republic was proclaimed on 28 November. As a colonel, Micombero took power as the country's first President in December 1966.\n\nAs President of Burundi, Micombero ruled through UPRONA as a one-party state. His ideology of \"democratic centralism\" brought all the country's institutions and media under the regime's control. His regime combined ideas from the socialist ideology of Tanzania with other doctrines from Joseph-Désiré Mobutu's regime in the Congo. As a Cold War leader, he was able to play off both Communist and Western powers against one another.\n\nMicombero became increasingly paranoid after suffering an injury in a road accident in 1967. He was widely believed to be an alcoholic. Various plots against the regime were discovered and unrest remained. His base of support became increasingly restricted to Tutsi in the northern and central regions of Burundi.\n\nIn April 1972, a major rebellion broke out among the Hutu in the south at the encouragement of the Tanzanian regime. In subsequent ethnic violence, as many as 1,000 Tutsi were killed. The reaction of the Micombero regime was to launch a genocidal campaign against the Hutu in the region in which around 100,000 people are thought to have been killed. The deposed king Ntare, said to have led the rebellion, was murdered. In 1973, after further violence, the Congolese Mobutu regime had to intervene to prevent Tanzanian invasion. Following the end of the crisis, Micombero introduced a new constitution allowing him to run for a further seven-year term. He also laid the foundation for the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries the same year, along with the governments of Rwanda and Congo. \n\nIn November 1976, opponents of Micombero's regime, led by Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, led a successful coup d'état. Micombero himself was arrested and a second republic was declared under the dictatorship of Bagaza which would last until 1987.\n\nMicombero was exiled from Burundi in 1977. He took up residence in Somalia, then ruled by dictator Siad Barre who was a close friend. He gained a degree in economics from the University of Somalia in 1982. He died of a heart attack in 1983.\n\n"}

Featherstone committed several mob killings before he was convicted in 1986 of a murder he had not committed. Facing almost 25 years in jail, he became an informant and brought down Coonan's gang.\n\nFeatherstone was born on West 43rd St., one of nine children. His mother helped with the Veterans of Foreign Wars and his father was a United States Customs Service officer. He had blond hair and was often said to be baby-faced. He served in the Vietnam War as member of the Green Berets aged just 17 after lying about his age. He served as a stock clerk. To his disappointment, he did not see combat, although he was circumcised by his friends in a drunken prank. He received a medical discharge in 1967 after just a year, claiming to have hallucinations.\n\nWhen a group from New Jersey entered Hell's Kitchen called the Riley brothers a fight started with the outsiders, Featherstone returned with a rifle and shot one of the brothers John Riley in the arm, for which he was arrested and probationed. He shot dead Linwood Willis in a confrontation outside a bar in 1971, but was found not guilty due to insanity. He spent time in a series of mental hospitals, being released in 1975. He would act out frequently while in the hospitals, leading to him being restrained and injected with thorazine. He began spending time in saloons like Club 596 and Sunbrite that were hangouts for the Westies.\n\nFeatherstone's penchant for violence and intimidation caught the eye of Coonan and Featherstone became Coonan's right-hand man by 1976. Mickey Spillane, the mob leader in Hell's Kitchen at the time, was shot five times outside his apartment in August 1977, and Featherstone was arrested but acquitted for his killing. The police suspected him of a series of mob contract killings. He went on trial with Coonan for the killing of a barman, but they were acquitted in December 1979 after one witness killed himself and another refused to testify. He was finally jailed after using fake currency at a massage parlor - he was traced because the girl remembered seeing his name tattooed on his forearm. Featherstone did time in the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield Missouri on the psychiatric ward in 1982. He was a model prisoner, seen daily picking fine lint off of his perfectly made bunk to pass inspection, and starting arguments with others for not polishing their door frame brass. The institution kept Featherstone working on the ward, out of General Population, for his own safety. In February 1982, he was sentenced to six years in jail for counterfeiting.\n\nFeatherstone and Coonan had a falling out over the latter's alliance with the Gambino crime family, which Featherstone saw as a betrayal of all the Irish-Americans in Hell's Kitchen.\n\nFeatherstone was convicted in March 1986 for the April 1985 murder of Michael Holly, despite being innocent of this particular murder, which was a revenge attack probably carried out by another of the Westies, Billy Bokun. He was shocked at receiving his sentence of 25 years in prison, and concluded that he had been framed by his own gang. Rather than serving his sentence he instead told prosecutors that Bokun had committed the murder, and he became an informant. His wife Sissy co-operated with the District Attorney's office to tape incriminating conversations with gang members, including Bokun. In September 1986, Judge Alvin Schlesinger overturned Featherstone's conviction. His testimony at Coonan's racketeering trial during 1987-8 helped to bring down Coonan's gang. He pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge and received a suspended sentence of five years probation from Judge Robert W. Sweet due to his cooperation with the authorities. He was freed in December 1988 and went into a witness protection program.\n\n"}

Arnold had changed sides in September 1780, after his plot was exposed to surrender the key Continental Army outpost at West Point. He spent the rest of 1780 recruiting Loyalists for a new regiment called the American Legion. Arnold was then sent to Virginia with 1,600 men in late December by General Sir Henry Clinton, with instructions to raid Richmond and then establish a strong fortification at Portsmouth.\n\nHe landed in Virginia on January 4, 1781 and raided Richmond the next day. They raided a few nearby communities, then returned to Portsmouth, where the troops established fortifications. They remained there until late March, when 2,000 reinforcements arrived, led by General William Phillips. Phillips took command of the forces and Arnold served under him, as they resumed raiding operations aimed at potentially establishing a permanent presence at Richmond. They fought off a spirited militia defense in the Battle of Blandford in late April, and the timely arrival of Continental forces under the Marquis de Lafayette prevented the taking of Richmond. Phillips continued to raid, but was ordered to Petersburg to effect a junction with General Charles Cornwallis, who was marching up from North Carolina. Phillips died on May 13 of a fever, and Arnold was briefly in command again until Cornwallis arrived a week later. Arnold returned to New York, suffering from a recurrence of gout.\n\nFrench and American movements to encircle Cornwallis at Yorktown became apparent to General Clinton, so he sent Arnold on a raiding expedition in early September to New London, Connecticut in an attempt to draw American resources away from Virginia. Arnold raided the port, but a detachment of his troops was involved in the bloody Battle of Groton Heights at a fort across the Thames River. The operation was the last command that Arnold held. General Cornwallis had been released on parole after his surrender at Yorktown, and he and Arnold sailed for England in December.\n\nDuring his command of British troops, Arnold did not gain a great deal of respect from other officers. His actions in Virginia and Connecticut were criticized, and allegations circulated in New York that he was primarily interested in money. On his arrival in England, he was also unable to acquire new commands, either in the army or with the British East India Company. He resumed his business and trade activities, and died in London in 1801.\n\nBenedict Arnold was born in 1741 into a well-to-do family in the port city of Norwich in the colony of Connecticut. He was interested in military affairs from an early age, serving briefly (without seeing action) in the colonial militia during the French and Indian War in 1757. He embarked on a career as a businessman, first opening a shop in New Haven and then engaging in overseas trade. He owned and operated ships, sailing to the West Indies, New France, and Europe. When the British Parliament began to impose taxes on its colonies, Arnold's businesses began to be affected by them and the resulting opposition, which he eventually joined. In 1767, he married a local woman with whom he had three children, one of whom died in infancy. She died in 1775, and Arnold left his children under the care of his sister Hannah at his home in New Haven.\n\nArnold had distinguished himself early in the war, participating in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775 and then boldly leading a raid on Fort Saint-Jean near Montreal. He then led a small army from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Quebec City on an expedition through the wilderness of present-day Maine, where he was wounded in the climactic Battle of Quebec on December 31, 1775. After leading an ineffectual siege of Quebec until April 1776, he took over the military command of Montreal. He directed the American retreat from there on the arrival of British reinforcements, and his forces formed the rear guard of the retreating Continental Army as it headed south toward Ticonderoga. Arnold then organized the defense of Lake Champlain, and led the Continental Navy fleet that was defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island.\n\nDuring these actions, Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress. He established a decent relationship with George Washington, commander of the army, as well as with Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates, both of whom had command of the army's Northern Department at different times during 1775 and 1776. However, an acrimonious dispute arose with Moses Hazen, commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment, which boiled into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776. Only action by Gates, his superior at Ticonderoga, prevented his own arrest on countercharges leveled by Hazen. He also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton, two lower-level officers with political connections. His conflict with them resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part. Brown was particularly vicious, publishing a handbill that claimed of Arnold, \"Money is this man's God, and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country\".\n\nIn December 1776, Washington sent Arnold to coordinate the defense of Rhode Island after the British occupied Newport. No offensive action was possible, due to inadequate supplies and militia training. In February 1777, Arnold was passed over by Congress for promotion to major general—along with several other brigadiers. While en route to Philadelphia to discuss the matter, he stopped in New Haven to visit his family, and fought in the rearguard Battle of Ridgefield against a British raiding party in which his left leg was injured once again. In Philadelphia, Arnold threatened to resign over the issue of rank, but demurred when it was learned that Ticonderoga had fallen. He was sent north to assist in the defense of the Hudson River valley, and he helped lift the Siege of Fort Stanwix in August, and then played key roles in the two Battles of Saratoga in September and October. He was stripped of his command after the first battle in a dispute with General Gates, who had come to see Arnold as a competitor for rank and glory. Midway through the second battle, he rode to the battlefield anyway and led the troops in a spirited attack on two British redoubts, suffering serious injuries to his leg.\n\nArnold recovered from his injuries, though he walked with a cane for the rest of his life, and Washington gave him the military command of Philadelphia after the British withdrew from the city in May 1778. There his actions increased political opposition to him, and further inquiries were made into his affairs. He also began consorting with Loyalist sympathizers, and married Peggy Shippen, the daughter of one such man. Shortly after, he opened negotiations with British General Sir Henry Clinton, mediated by British Major John André, offering his services to their side.\n\nHe resigned his Philadelphia command in anger after poor treatment by Congress and local opponents. He then sought the command of West Point, the key Continental Army base on the Hudson River, and acquired it in July 1780. He began to comply with plans to make it easier for the British to defeat West Point, systematically weakening its defenses. The plot was exposed in September 1780 when American forces captured Major André; Arnold fled to New York and was given a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army. Major André was hanged as a spy, greatly upsetting the British.\n\nThe British gave Arnold a brigadier general's commission (one grade below his Continental Army rank) with an annual income of several hundred pounds, but they only paid him £6,315 ($350,000 in 2016) plus an annual pension of £360 ($19,000 in 2016) because his plot failed. He and his wife settled in New York, where the Loyalist elites at first snubbed them, but they were eventually overcome by Peggy's charm. Arnold began recruiting a new Loyalist regiment called the American Legion, enrolling his young sons in the unit (at least on paper). In spite of it Loyalists and other defectors did not flock in larger numbers as Arnold and Clinton hoped. Clinton then assigned Arnold to lead an expedition to the Chesapeake Bay. As his force began to take shape in November and December, rumors swirled in the city that many officers were refusing to serve under him. Many of the British soldiers in New York held Arnold responsible for the death of the popular Major André. Furthermore no British officer would serve under him.\n\nArnold's preparations for the Chesapeake Bay expedition interrupted a scheme to kidnap him which was hatched by George Washington and Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee. Pursuant to the plan, Lee's sergeant major John Champe staged a \"desertion\" from Lee's unit in New Jersey to British lines in New York late in October 1780, and convinced Arnold to take him on as a senior noncommissioned officer. Champe was supposed to make contact with covert operatives working in New York, with whom he would work to kidnap Arnold. After observing Arnold's habits, a plan was developed to be executed on the night of December 11. Arnold ordered his troops to embark on transports on December 11—including Champe—thus scuttling the attempt. Champe participated in the start of the expedition, and finally managed to escape several weeks later and return to Lee's unit. Washington and Lee rewarded him richly, and convinced him to retire from military service so that he would not risk hanging for his role in the affair if he was captured.\n\nArnold's force of 1,600 troops arrived off Virginia on January 1, 1781, landing on January 4. They captured Richmond by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills. This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, initiating Arnold's return to Portsmouth to hold the port there. The relative inactivity of holding the port led Arnold to request a change of command. Reinforcements arrived in March, led by William Phillips who had served under Burgoyne at Saratoga, and he took over the command. However, Clinton did not issue orders recalling Arnold, so he accompanied Phillips on new raiding expeditions into the Virginia countryside. The force advanced on Petersburg, where they defeated a militia force led by Baron von Steuben at the Battle of Blandford in late April. The arrival at Richmond of the Marquis de Lafayette and 900 Continental troops sent by General Washington to oppose Arnold prompted Phillips to begin making his way back to Portsmouth. While en route, they were ordered to return to Petersburg by Charles Cornwallis, the commander of the British southern army, where he would join them with his force. Phillips fell ill on the way and died of a fever at Petersburg on May 12.\n\nArnold commanded the army only until May 20, when Cornwallis arrived to take over. One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold, \"there are many officers who must wish some other general in command\". Cornwallis disregarded advice proferred by Arnold to locate a permanent base away from the coast that might have averted his later surrender at Yorktown. Shortly after Cornwallis's arrival, Arnold suffered a severe attack of gout and returned to New York.\nDuring Arnold's time in Virginia, two things happened that had a negative impact on his reputation. He wrote a letter to Lord George Germain, the British colonial secretary, criticizing Clinton's conduct of the war. Word of this communication reached Clinton, and Arnold was met with a frosty reception on his return to New York, and with assignments to perform menial administrative tasks. Arnold attempted to make amends, writing to Germain, \"I find my letter has given umbrage; I am extremely sorry for it.\"\n\nThe second incident was a dispute with his naval counterpart on the Chesapeake, Captain Thomas Symonds, over the distribution of prizes captured during the various expeditions. Symonds was so incensed by Arnold's attitude that he refused to leave port to respond to reports of transports carrying Lafayette's troops on the bay. The incident became widely known when Arnold got back to New York, prompting one officer to write, \"[Arnold] has hurt himself by discovering too much fondness for cash ... if he is attached to the latter ... he is no acquisition for us.\"\n\nArnold's stint in Virginia also demonstrated that he was a target of Patriot wrath and revenge. Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson issued a large reward for his capture, and Washington gave orders to Lafayette to summarily hang Arnold should he be captured. Lafayette had shadowed Arnold and Phillips when they went to Petersburg to join with Cornwallis. After Phillips died, Arnold tried to open communications with the marquis; the letters were returned unopened by Lafayette. Washington wrote to Lafayette, \"Your conduct… meets my approbation… in refusing to correspond with Arnold.\" In conversation with one of Lafayette's officers sent to confer on prisoner exchanges, Arnold is said to have asked what would happen to him should he be captured. The response was, \"We should cut off the leg which was wounded in the country's service, and we should hang the rest of you.\" (The Boot Monument at the Saratoga National Historical Park honors his role there with a representation of his left boot, but it does not name him.)\n\nOn his return to New York in June, Arnold made a variety of proposals for continuing to attack economic or military targets (including West Point) in order to force the Americans to end the war. Clinton was not interested in most of his aggressive ideas, but the arrival of 3,000 new Hessian troops led him to relent. He authorized an expedition against the port of New London, Connecticut, near Arnold's childhood home of Norwich. Arnold's force of more than 1,700 men raided and burned New London on September 4, not long after the birth of his second son, and they captured Fort Griswold, causing damage estimated at $500,000. British casualties were high; nearly one quarter of the force sent against Fort Griswold was killed or wounded, a rate at which Clinton claimed he could ill afford more such victories. Arnold only reported 44 killed and 127 wounded in his official report, but there were unofficial whispers that between 400 and 500 casualties had occurred, with at least one claim that it had been like \"a Bunker Hill expedition\".\n\nThe capture of Fort Griswold was followed by the British slaughtering the surviving garrison after the Americans had surrendered. Of a garrison numbering about 150, more than 130 were killed or seriously wounded. Stephen Hempstead was one of the American survivors; he stated, \"After the massacre, they plundered us of everything we had, and left us literally naked.\" Hempstead was among the wounded and reported that he was placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The wagon was allowed to run down the hill, where it crashed into a tree, throwing some of the wounded men off the wagon and aggravating their injuries.\nArnold was not in a position to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.\n\nEven before the surrender of Cornwallis in October, Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord Germain his thoughts on the war in person. When word reached New York of the surrender, Arnold renewed the request, which Clinton then granted. On December 8, 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England. In London, he aligned himself with the Tories, advising Germain and King George III to renew the fight against the Americans. In the House of Commons, Edmund Burke expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold \"at the head of a part of a British army\" lest \"the sentiments of true honor, which every British officer [holds] dearer than life, should be afflicted.\" To Arnold's detriment, the anti-war Whigs had gotten the upper hand in Parliament, and Germain was forced to resign, with the government of Lord North falling not long after.\n\nArnold then applied to accompany General Carleton, who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years, and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism. One particularly harsh critic said that Arnold was a \"mean mercenary, who, having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge.\" In turning him down for an East India Company posting, George Johnstone wrote, \"Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct, the generality do not think so. While this is the case, no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company.\"\n\nArnold saw no further military duty, despite repeated attempts to gain command positions in the British Army or with the British East India Company. He resumed business activities, engaging in trade while based in Saint John, New Brunswick and then London. He died in London in 1801, and was buried without military honors.\n\n"}

He was a Chief of the Sak-kaw-wen-o-wak Plains Cree, notable for his role as the leader of his people during the signing of Treaty 6 in 1876. He was born circa 1796 to a French father, Bernard Belanger (b.c. 1760), and a Nakoda mother,\nKakakewachin (b. 1765) near Slave Lake in what is now the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Due to the dwindling buffalo population caused by excessive hunting, he was forced to look for new strategies to ensure the survival of his people and their culture. The loss of the buffalo threatened his people and he believed that the only way to save his people would be to negotiate with the Canadian Government. He held great influence over his people and it was due to this influence that he, and his close ally Ahtahkakoop, were able to argue successfully for the adoption of Treaty 6 by his fellow Cree. Mistawasis made history as the first signatory of Treaty 6. After the treaty was signed he remained an ally of the Canadian government until his death.\n\nThe exact date of Mistawasis’ birth is disputed. Estimations indicate that may have been born sometime between 1796 and 1813. The location of his birth was in the area of Slave Lake, Saskatchewan. He was born to a French father by the name of Bernard Belanger and a woman of Assiniboine descent. His birth name was Pierre Belanger, though it was rarely used in his adulthood. He had siblings, though the exact number is unknown, one of them went by the same name as their father, Bernard Belanger. Mistawasis married Iskwesis Sitipinatowe and had at least two children. He then married married Ann Awasis Mashe Nah Sho Wishk (b. 1800) and had 5 children. \n\nThe Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) would utilize his prowess as a provider, commonly trading for buffalo meat in exchange for other goods. He also worked as a freighter for the HBC. He was known to some as Piwapiskomostos, a name meaning \"Iron Buffalo\". He received this name after a hunting accident where he was tossed from horseback onto one of the buffalo he was hunting. Despite this he sustained no injuries from the encounter, earning him the moniker of Piwapiskomostos. The famous Cree Chief Pitokwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) is his maternal nephew.\n\nThe American buffalo’s habitat once ranged in the general area from the American east coast, south-west to near Mexico, and northwards to Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories. They are the largest land mammals found on the continent of North America. The Buffalo’s first contact with Europeans most likely occurred in the 1500s when they were spotted by Spanish conquistadors. Estimates suggest that at this time there was roughly 25-30 million wild buffalo living in North America. This number would dwindle severely to less than 100 in the American Great Plains states by the 1880s, with between 10-15 million dying over a ten-year period. In Canada the buffalo were most commonly hunted for the purpose of acquiring their skins or for preserving the animals meat for later ingestion in the form of pemmican. The fur trade was especially detrimental to populations as the hunters would, more often than not, prioritize acquiring the furs of the females over that of the males. This was due to their relative lightness as well as the ability to tan the furs at a quicker rate then the males. The majority of hunts were carried out in the winter, due to the buffalo’s hair growing thicker in this time of the year. Winter happened to coincide with the buffalo’s breeding season, meaning that many of the buffalo killed had a high possibility of being in some stage of pregnancy at the time. Being that buffalo only have one calf per year, the removal of large numbers of pregnant buffalo significantly weakened the animal’s ability to naturally replenish its population.\n\nOne of the most important features of the Cree’s way of life was the buffalo. It was a resource which was used extensively by the Cree for many different purposes. Its meat was used as food for personal sustenance as well as for trade with the Hudson’s Bay Company. Its skin was used in the construction of living quarters. It was also used by the various indigenous groups of the region to make clothing, amounting to roughly two buffalo skins per person per year to be dedicated to the production of new clothing. The animal’s bones were often used to create most of the tools used by the Cree people. Buffalo were important for trade with the Hudson’s Bay Company as this trade was the only possible way for the Cree to acquire such useful goods as guns, as well as the ammunition needed to use the weapons. The Cree would hunt buffalo often without horses, to over come the difficulties associated with this they would often herd the animals into corrals so they could then kill them in a more manageable way.\n\nThe sudden decrease in buffalo further destabilized the region by causing the Cree to trespass into Blackfoot territory in search of buffaloes. This trespassing would often lead to skirmishes between the two groups which could often end in loss of life on both sides. This fighting included numerous battles which resulted in the deaths of many Cree warriors. The Cree and Blackfoot would see peace in 1857, though it was short lived and war was restarted in 1860. The Cree would continue to use the war as a means to venture west, in search of the buffaloes which no longer existed in their homelands. The war would then continue in a sporadic and destructive nature until a permanent peace was finally signed in 1871. The war had caused extensive loss of life for the Cree and failed to result in the expansion of their territory to the buffalo rich areas of the west.\n\nThe sudden loss of an abundance of buffalo caused fear to spread throughout native communities in the 1870s. It was from this fear, and a hope for the future, that Mistawasis began to think about what he wanted his people’s future to look like. It was from this perspective that Mistawasis and other leaders of the Cree communities began to believe that negotiation with the Canadian Crown Authorities would be their best course of action. One of the items Mistawasis hoped to acquire for his people was access to education. He perceived a European education as important to the future survival of his people and attempted to gain access to this through the Canadian government. He wanted to ensure that his people would be provided not only with school houses but also the teachers to operate and instruct in them. It was due to this belief that his peoples' way of life was disappearing along with his hope of an improved future that caused him to attend the negotiations at Fort Carlton in late August 1876. The British crown was represented by several men with British Treaty Commissioner Alexander Morris taking the leading role. Mistawasis argued for the treaty as a necessity for acquiring food by claiming that \"Our way of living is gone, there are no more buffalo, we have to find a new way to feed our people.\" During much of the treaty negotiation process, Mistawasis' points of view were shared by his friend and ally Ahtahkakoop. Ahtahkakoop, like Mistawasis, was also concerned about the decrease in available buffalo. Ahtahkakoop was also quite interested in obtaining an education for his people, as well as help in gaining a better understanding of agriculture to fill the void in food left by the disappearance of the buffalo. Mistawasis and Ahtahkakoop were met with resistance by other Chiefs of the Cree nation. The Cree Chief Poundmaker disagreed with the ideas of Mistawasis. He was supported by other dissenting opinions of Chiefs Young Chipewyan, and The Badger. Poundmaker’s main argument against the signing of the treaty was his belief that the Canadian government would only adhere to the Cree demands in exchange for hegemony over all of the Cree’s lands, a price he did not want to pay. Mistawasis countered the argument of the chiefs who shared Poundmaker’s outlook by challenging them to provide a better solution that what the Canadians were offering. Mistawasis further argued \"…that the Great White Queen Mother has offered us a way of life when the buffalo are no more. Gone they will be before many snows have come to cover our heads or graves if such should be.\" He further argued that the queen would \"stop the senseless wars among our people, against the Blackfoot, Peigans, and Bloods.\" He also believed that by allying himself with the Queen that he could restrict the sale of alcohol to his people, a goal that he was personally passionate about. On top of all this he argued that none of them could hope to survive in the face of the increasing flow of immigrants from the east on their own. Mistawasis ended his argument by declaring \"I for one will take the hand that is offered.\" Ahtahkakoop shared the same sentiments as Mistawasis. After presenting his points to the other Chiefs, Mistawasis became the first of the men gathered to sign Treaty 6. The other Cree Chiefs were swayed by the word of Mistawasis and Ahtahkakoop and agreed to sign the treaty, which would from then on be known as Treaty 6. Treaty 6 would later be added onto by other members of the Cree nation at Fort Pitt in September 1876.\n\nWhen the initial stage of Treaty 6 was complete it contained many provisions which were favorable to the Cree people. It contained all rights and protections previously awarded in Treaties One through Five. This meant that the Cree were entitled to: monetary compensation/assistance from the federal government, the establishment of reserve lands which were off limits to outsiders, they would be fully provided with farm equipment, and finally that their Chiefs would receive uniforms and medals befitting their positions. In addition to these basic tenets it also contained some additional decrees. In response to the dwindling buffalo populations, the Cree were promised protection if they were to suffer from famine during their conversion to agriculture, in other words the Canadian Government agreed to send food relief in times of need. The other major provision added to Treaty 6 was that each Indian agent would maintain a fully stocked medicine chest to be utilized by the Cree in the event of any disease outbreaks.\n\nAfter the signing of Treaty 6, Mistawasis maintained a close relationship to the crown authorities. He used his power to attempt to stop the flow of alcohol into his people’s territory, his work in doing so was one of the reasons the Canadian Government created the Northwest Mounted Police, to help in this venture. He is also responsible for the establishment of Mistawasis First Nation, which was named after him. Mistawasis would later allow a Presbyterian Mission to be established on his reserve. Mistawasis maintained a positive relationship with the Canadian Government during the 1885 Riel Rebellion, when he offered to defend the city of Prince Albert from any incursion by Riel. Mistawasis was in attendance at the unveiling of the Joseph Brant Memorial in 1886. During this visit to Ontario he met Prime Minister John A. MacDonald, and became enamored with the culture and technology of Canada.\n\nLike his birth date, the exact date of Mistawasis’ death is also not known, although his final resting place is in the cemetery of the Presbyterian church built on his reserve. Dates of 1886, 1896, and 1903 have all been given as the true date. After his death he was succeeded as chief by George Dreaver, who remained Chief until he passed away in 1938. George was then succeeded by his son, and Mistawasis' grandson, Joe Dreaver who served as Chief of Mistawasis First Nation for 25 years.\n\nThe City of Saskatoon named its newest vehicular bridge the Chief Mistawasis Bridge on June 21, 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "30933488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30933488", "title": "Prophets and messengers in Islam", "text": "Prophets and messengers in Islam\n\nProphets in Islam () include \"messengers\" (\"rasul\", pl. \"rusul\"), bringers of a divine revelation via an angel (Arabic: , malāʾikah); and \"prophets\" (\"nabī\", pl. \"anbiyāʼ\"), lawbringers that Muslims believe were sent by God to every person, bringing God's message in a language they can understand. Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the six articles of the Islamic faith, and specifically mentioned in the Quran.\n\nMuslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, Adam (ادم), created by Allah (الله). Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 prophets in Judaism and many prophets of Christianity are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish Elisha is called Eliyas, Job is Ayyub, Jesus is Isa, etc. The Torah given to Moses (Musa) is called \"Tawrat\", the Psalms given to David (Dawud) is the \"Zabur\", the Gospel given to Jesus is \"Injil\".\n\nUnique to Islam is Muhammad (Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh), who Muslims believe is the \"Seal of the Prophets\" (\"Khatam an-Nabiyyin\", i.e. the last prophet); and the Quran, revealed to Muhammad but not written down by him, which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by God from distortion or corruption, destined to remain in its true form until the Last Day. Muslims believe Muhammad to be the last prophet, although after the prophets there are still saints (though some modern schools, such as Salafism and Wahhabism, reject the theory of sainthood).\n\nIn Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the Oneness of God, worshipping of that one God, avoidance of idolatry and sin, and the belief in the Day of Resurrection or the Day of Judgement and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final \"Islamic prophet and messenger\" of God, who would be named \"Ahmed and Muhammad\". \n\nThis narrative is found in \"Chapter of the Ranks\", Qur'an, 61:6 as Allah asked Jesus to remind the Children of Israel but they accused him of the prophecy:\n\nوَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَـٰبَنِى إِسْرَٰعِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبينٌ \n\n\"wa-idh qāla ‘Īsā ’b·nu Maryama: \"yā Banī Israā‘īla innī Rasūlu ’llāhi ilay-kum muṣaddiqal li-mā bayna yadayya mina ’t-Tawraāti wa-mubash·shiram bi-Rasūlin ya’tī mim ba‘dī ’s·mu-huū Aḥmadu, fa-lammā jaā’a-hum bi’l-bayyināti, qālū \"hādhā siḥrum mubīn!\"\"\n\nIn Arabic and Hebrew, the term \"nabī\" (Arabic plural form: أَنْبِيَاء \"anbiyāʼ\") means \"prophet\". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term \"nubuwwah\" (Arabic: نُبُوَّة meaning \"prophethood\") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms \"rasūl\" (Arabic plural: رُسُل \"rusul\") and \"mursal\" (ِArabic singular: مُرْسَل \"mursal\"; plural: مُرْسَلُون \"mursalūn\") denote \"messenger with law given/ received by GOD\" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic \"message\" (ِArabic singular: رِسَالَة \"risālah\"; plural: رِسَالَات \"risālāt\"), appears in the Quran in ten instances.\n\nThe Syriac form of \"rasūl Allāh\" (literally: \"messenger of God\"), \"s̲h̲eliḥeh d-allāhā\", occurs frequently in the apocryphal \"Acts of St. Thomas\". The corresponding verb for \"s̲h̲eliḥeh\"—\"s̲h̲alaḥ\", occurs in connection with the prophets in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nThe words \"prophet\" (Arabic: ) and \"messenger\" (Arabic: ) appear several times in the Old Testament and the New Testament.\n\nThe following table shows these words in different languages:\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the word \"nabi\" (\"spokesperson, prophet\") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word \"mal'akh\" (\"messenger\") refers to Angels in Judaism. According to Judaism, Haggai, Zaqariah, and Malachi were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian exile. With them, the authentic period of \"Nevuah\" (\"prophecy\") died, and nowadays only the \"Bath Kol\" (בת קול, lit. \"daughter of a voice\", \"voice of God\") exists (Sanhedrin 11a).\n\nIn the New Testament, however, the word \"messenger\" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet. \"Messenger\" may refer to Jesus, to his Apostles and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the Book of Malachi, speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet John the Baptist (Yahya).\n\nIn Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of charity, prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived. The Quran itself calls Islam the \"religion of Abraham\" (Ibrahim) and refers to Jacob (Yaqub) and the Twelve Tribes of Israel as being Muslim.\n\nThe Quran says\nIslam teaches that prophets were \"protected from sin\" by God, so unlike lesser human beings they cannot commit a sin. The Quran speaks of the \"Islamic prophets\" as being the greatest human beings of all time. A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam. Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40. Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle. \n\nThe Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:\n\nBiblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, Joseph (Yusuf) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish Hebrew Bible, the Greek Old Testament and the Greek New Testament, in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is \"God's practice\" (\"sunnat Allah\") to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. \"We have made the evil ones friends to those without faith.\" \"Assuredly God will defend those who believe.\" Thus the Islamic Isa did not die on the cross like the Christian thought about Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.\n\nThe prophets and messengers \"share no divine attributes\", and possess \"no knowledge or power\" other than that granted to them by God.\n\nMuslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran states: \"There is a Messenger for every community\" The \"hadith\" reports that the Prophet Muhammad said that there were approximately 124,000 prophets and 313 messengers (\"a good number\"). According to scholars such as Ibn Kathir and Shu'ayb al-Arna'oot the narration is weak, if not fabricated.\n\nMost mainstream Sunni scholars agree that prophets were males only. Still, some like Ibn Hazm, Qartubi, Ibn Hajir, and al Ash‘ari thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophethood. Also, Ibn Hajir interprets the Hadith \"Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran; and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh.\" He said perfection is prophethood, hence his claim that Mary and Asiya were prophets.\n\nThe revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind, all these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an article of faith in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either corrupted or lost. Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.\n\nThe Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:\n\nThe Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of \"wisdom\" or \"knowledge\" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it. It also mentions that Joseph and Moses both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying Goliath; Lot (Lut received wisdom whilst prophesying in Sodom and Gomorrah; John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth; and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.\n\nAll messengers mentioned in the Quran are also prophets, but not all prophets are messengers.\n\nTo believe in God's messengers (Rusul) means to be convinced that God sent men as guides to fellow human beings and jinn (khalq) to guide them to the truth.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Community does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words \"warner\" (\"nadhir\"), \"prophet\", and \"messenger\" as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues. The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes Mirza Ghulam Ahmad also known as Mirza Qadiani (1835–1908) as such a “prophet” of gods and the promised Messiah and Imam Mahdi of the latter days. The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement rejects his status as a prophet, instead considering him to be a renewer of the faith. However, all other Muslims and their scholars argue and firmly establish that the Ahmadiyya community are not even Muslim due to the fact their beliefs violate the Muslim belief in Muhammad as the \"Seal of the Prophets\" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).\n\nThe Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God (Allah) sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Qur'an discuss this:\n\n\nNumerous other people have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, exegesis, commentary. These people include:\n\n\n"}

A pro-slavery extremist and an early advocate of secession, he was a \"Fire-Eater\".\n\nRhett published his views through his newspaper, the \"Charleston Mercury\".\n\nHe was born Robert Barnwell Smith in Beaufort, South Carolina, United States. He later studied law.\n\nHe was a member of the South Carolina legislature in 1826 until 1832. He was extremely pro-slavery in his views. At the end of the Nullification Crisis in 1833, he told the South Carolina Nullification Convention:\n\nIn 1832, Rhett became South Carolina attorney general and served until 1837. He was then elected US Representative and served until 1849. In 1838, he changed his last name from Smith to that of a prominent colonial ancestor, Colonel William Rhett. He objected vehemently to the protectionist Tariff of 1842.\n\nOn July 31, 1844, he launched the Bluffton Movement, which called for South Carolina to return to nullification or else declare secession. It was soon repudiated by more moderate South Carolina Democrats, including even Senator John C. Calhoun, who feared it would endanger the presidential candidacy of James K. Polk.\n\nRhett opposed the Compromise of 1850 as against the interests of the slave-holding South. He joined fellow Fire-Eaters at the Nashville Convention of 1850, which failed to endorse his aim of secession for the whole South. After the Nashville Convention, Rhett, William Lowndes Yancey, and a few others met in Macon, Georgia on August 21, 1850, and formed the short-lived Southern National Party. In December 1850, he was became US Senator to complete the term left by the death of Calhoun. He continued to advocate secession in response to the Compromise, but in 1852, South Carolina refrained from declaring secession and merely passed an ordinance declaring a state's right to secede. Disappointed, he resigned his Senate seat.\n\nHe continued to express his fiery secessionist sentiments through the \"Charleston Mercury\", now edited by his son, Robert Jr.\n\nThe 1860 Democratic National Convention met in Charleston, South Carolina and a large bloc of Southern delegates walked out when the platform was insufficiently pro-slavery. That led to the division of the party and separate Northern and Southern nominees for President, which practically guaranteed the election of an anti-slavery Republican, which in turn triggered declarations of secession in seven states. During the 1860 presidential campaign, a widely-credited report in the \"Nashville Patriot\" said that the outcome was the intended result of a conspiracy by Rhett, Yancey, and William Porcher Miles hatched at the Southern Convention in Montgomery, Alabama, in May 1858.\n\nAfter the election of the Republican Party's Abraham Lincoln, Rhett was elected to the South Carolina Secession Convention, which declared secession in December. He was chosen as deputy from South Carolina to the Provisional Confederate States Congress in Montgomery. He was one of the most active deputies and was the chairman of the committee that reported the Confederate States Constitution. He was then elected to the Confederate House of Representatives. He received no higher office in the Confederate government and returned to South Carolina. During the rest of the American Civil War, he sharply criticized the policies of President Jefferson Davis.\n\nAfter the war. Rhett settled in Louisiana. Contrary to rumors, he was not a delegate to the 1868 Democratic National Convention, but it was his son, Robert Rhett Jr., who had shared his father's editorship responsibilities. He died in St. James Parish, Louisiana, and is interred at Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston.\n\nRhett was of English ancestry. On his mother's side, he was related to U.S. Representative Robert Barnwell (his great-uncle) and Senator Robert Woodward Barnwell (son of Robert). A cousin of the Barnwells was the wife of Alexander Garden.\n\nThe Robert Barnwell Rhett House was declared to be a National Historic Landmark in 1973.\n\n\n\n"}

His \"Infidel home missionary tour\" was an incident in Charles Darwin's education, leaving Darwin with a memory of \"the Devil's Chaplain\" as a warning of the dangers of dissent from Church of England doctrine.\n\nHe was the sixth son of John and Elizabeth Taylor, born at Walnut Tree House, Edmonton, London, on 18 August 1784. His father, an ironmonger in Fenchurch Street, London, died when he was young, leaving him under the guardianship of his uncle, Edward Farmer Taylor of Chicken Hall, Bridgnorth, Shropshire. Having been at school under John Adams at Edmonton, he was articled as house pupil to Samuel Partridge, then house surgeon at the Birmingham General Hospital. In Birmingham Taylor underwent a religious conversion, after hearing Edward Burn preach.\n\nIn 1805 Taylor continued as a medical student, walking Guy's and St. Thomas's hospitals in London under Sir Astley Paston Cooper and Henry Cline, and was admitted a member of the College of Surgeons in 1807. Under the influence of Thomas Cotterill, perpetual curate of Lane End, Staffordshire, he decided to study for the church.\n\nTaylor studied at St John's College, Cambridge for three years to qualify as a clergyman. At that time the University of Cambridge was dominated by the established Church of England and most students were preparing for positions in the Anglican church. The Revd. Charles Simeon got Taylor his first curacy, but five years after ordination Taylor abandoned orthodox Christianity for evangelism and then eccentric anti-clericalism.\n\nTaylor set up a \"Christian Evidence Society\" and lectured in London pubs dressed in elaborate vestments, attacking the Anglican liturgy and the barbarities of the Establishment for what he called its \"Pagan creed\". At this time blasphemy was a criminal offence against the faith \"by law established\", and he was sentenced to a year in gaol. In his cell he wrote \"The Diegesis\", attacking Christianity on the basis of comparative mythology and attempting to expound it as a scheme of solar myths.\n\nHe was an advocate of the Christ myth theory and has been described as a \"staunch defender of the mythicist thesis\".\n\nUpon his release, with his book newly published, he joined forces with the Radical Richard Carlile for an \"infidel home missionary tour\". On Thursday 21 May 1829, they arrived in Cambridge, strolled round the colleges, and in the evening attended Holy Trinity Church for a hell-fire sermon by the Revd. Simeon, which they sneered at as \"one of the worst imaginable for the morals of mankind\".\n\nNext day they rented lodgings for a fortnight above a print shop in Rose Crescent from the unsuspecting landlord William Smith, as their \"Infidel Head-Quarters\". By noon they had sent a printed challenge to the Vice-Chancellor, the leading Doctors of Divinity, the heads of all the colleges and the Revd. Simeon:\n\nThey then went around the University precincts, with Taylor immaculately dressed in university cap and gown greeting old friends, giving out circulars and seeking out freethinkers.\n\nOn the Saturday morning an anticipated article about their mission failed to appear in the morning paper. The university Proctors who were in charge of discipline interrogated the landlord, then demanded his lodging-house licence. Smith refused to hand it over, and appealed to the Vice-Chancellor, \"most deferentially\" asking the reason as he had not violated any regulations, and the licence had been granted its annual renewal the day before, but received no reply. The Vice-Chancellor and Proctors revoked the licence and made the lodgings out of bounds, posting a notice in the butteries of all the colleges to warn the students, among them Charles Darwin, then in his second year.\n\nThe Radical pair responded to this \"paltry spite\" the next day by putting a public notice on the door of the University Library, challenging a university that \"punishes the innocent... crushes the weak... oppresses [and] persecutes\", taking away half the livelihood of Smith, with his wife and six children. On Monday all the students were talking about this iniquitous situation, and a group of \"young men\" prepared vigilante action against the Radicals to avenge the landlord. Carlile and Taylor heard of this, and on Tuesday apologised to the landlord, prodded the authorities to restore his licence, and slipped out of town. They were satisfied that they had uncovered \"about fifty... young collegians, who were somewhat bold in vowing Infidelity among each other\", though few would \"break... the shackles\" of their education and they would have \"a most painful conflict to endure.\"\n\nTheir tour included Lancashire, and at a meeting in Bolton they met Eliza Sharples, who was to continue propagating their message in performances at the Rotunda while they were imprisoned.\n\nAmidst public unrest in July 1830 when Charles X of France was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the Tory government of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Carlile gave Taylor a platform in the Blackfriars Rotunda, a ramshackle building on the south bank of the River Thames where republican atheists gathered. Several times a week Taylor dressed in \"canonicals\", staged infidel melodramas, preaching bombastic sermons to artisans. Two Sunday sermons on \"The Devil\" caused particular outrage when he pronounced \"God and the Devil... to be but one and the self-same being... Hell and Hell-fire... are, in the original, nothing more than names and titles of the Supreme God.\" He was then dubbed \"The Devil's Chaplain\", and thousands of copies of his ceremonies were circulated in a seditious publication, \"The Devil's Pulpit\". As the Tory government collapsed in November, Taylor preached against the establishment while a revolutionary tricolour flew from the roof of \"The Rotunda\".\n\nAt the start of April 1831 Taylor was again indicted for blasphemy over two Easter sermons in the last days of \"The Rotunda\". He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Horsemonger Lane Gaol whence he sent protesting letters to \"The Times\", but his pleas were snubbed by the Home Secretary William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. In a letter to W.Watts, Taylor described his physical decline and fear that \"the Christians have determined to kill me... I never expect to leave this Bastile but Heels foremost. Your greatly obliged Murdered Friend, Robert Taylor.\" (Despite his fears, he lived until 1844. The letter is now in the possession of Larry M. Wright, author of 'Christianity Astrology and Myth'.)\n\nBy January 1832 a \"new occupation of the building\" was promoted around London. From prison Taylor wrote that \"the spirit of the Rotunda lives\", and \"it opens with new spirit, with new attraction, with all that is lovely and virtuous in woman to grace it.\" From 9 February Eliza Sharples appeared as \"Isis\", the \"Lady of the Rotunda\", giving theatrically presented lectures which energetically decried Christianity, the priesthood, and the political establishment. In the first lecture she said she was \"neither of Taylor nor Carlisle; neither of Owen nor St Simon\", but would \"be the little busy bee extracting honey from all their doctrines\". There were soon claims that her lectures were, at least in part, written by Taylor and Carlisle. Her fiery presentations initially attracted attention, but interest fell away and her lectures finished at the end of April.\n\nTaylor would be remembered by Charles Darwin as a warning example of a social pariah. In 1857 as he worked towards the publication of his theory he wrote \"What a book a Devil's Chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low & horridly cruel works of Nature!\" in what Desmond and Moore argue is a reference to Taylor's nickname. However the term \"the Devil's Chaplain\" goes back to Chaucer who has his Parson say \"Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that syngen evere placebo.\"\n\nAs the reaction to Darwin's theory developed in March 1860 he described his close ally Thomas Huxley as his \"good and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel – i.e. the devil's gospel.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In his statement, made after historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi announced he had discovered in the Defense Agency library in Tokyo documentary evidence that the Imperial Japanese Army established and ran \"comfort stations\", he essentially admitted that the Japanese Imperial Army had been involved, directly and indirectly, in the establishment of \"comfort facilities\", and that coercion had been used in the recruitment and retention of the women. His subsequent call for historical research and education aimed at remembering the issue became the basis for addressing the subject of forced prostitution in school history textbooks.\n"}
