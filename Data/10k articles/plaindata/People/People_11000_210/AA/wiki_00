It was reported, though no proof is forthcoming, that Mme. Filleul had been the mistress of Louis XV and most royal genealogists give hers as his daughters, although never recognized. Her husband became one of the king's secretaries, and Mme. Filleul made many friends, among them Jean-François Marmontel. Their eldest daughter, Marie Françoise Julie Filleul (Château de Longpré, 1751Paris, 1822) married at the Château de Menars in 1767 Abel François Poisson, marquis de Vandières et de Marigny (1727–1781), the brother of Madame de Pompadour; Adélaïde-Émilie married on 30 January 1779 Alexandre Sébastien de Flahaut de La Billarderie, comte de Flahaut de La Billarderie, a soldier of some reputation, who was many years her senior.\n\nIn Paris she soon gathered round her a salon, in which the principal figure was Charles Maurice de Talleyrand. There are many allusions to their liaison in the diary of Gouverneur Morris, who was another of her lovers. In 1785 was born her son Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut, who was generally known to be Talleyrand's son. Mme de Flahaut fled from Paris in 1792 and joined the society of \"émigré\"s at Mickleham, Surrey, described in Mme. d'Arblay's \"Memoirs\". Her husband remained at Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he was arrested on 29 January 1793 and guillotined. Mme. de Flahaut now supported herself by writing novels, of which the first, \"Adèle de Sénanges\" (London, 1794), which is partly autobiographical, was the most famous.\n\nShe presently left London for Switzerland, where she met Louis Philippe, duke of Orleans. She travelled in his company to Hamburg, where she lived for two years, earning her living as a milliner. She returned to Paris in 1798, and on 17 October 1802 she married Dom José Maria de Sousa Botelho Mourão e Vasconcelos (Porto, 9 March 1758Paris, 1 June 1825), Portuguese minister plenipotentiary in Paris, 2nd Lord of the Majorat of Mateus, who was previously married in Lisbon on 23 November 1783 to Dona Maria Teresa de Noronha, of the Lords of the Majorat of os Apréstimos, by whom he had an only son, future 1st Count of Vila Real. Her husband was recalled in 1804, and was offered the Saint Petersburg embassy; but in the next year he resigned, to settle permanently in Paris, where he had many friends, among them the historian Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi. He spent his time chiefly in the preparation of a beautiful edition of the \"Lusiads\" of Luís de Camões, which he completed in 1817.\n\nMme. de Souza lost her social power after the fall of the First Empire, and was deserted even by Talleyrand, although he continued his patronage of Charles de Flahaut. Her husband died in 1825, and after the accession of Louis Philippe she lived in comparative retirement till her death. She brought up her grandson, Charles, duc de Morny, her son's natural son by Queen Hortense. Among her later novels were \"La Comtesse de Fargy\" (1822) and \"La Duchesse de Guise\" (1831). Her complete works were published between 1811 and 1822.\n"}

His younger brothers are Jomari Yllana, Ryan Yllana and Paulie Yllana.\n\nHe was married to actress Jacqui Manzano (born March 31, 1981) with four children: Mikaela, Andee, Jaime and Nathan.\n\nHe is a member of Scouts Royale Brotherhood (SRB) International Service Fraternity and Sorority under the banner of the Alpha Delta Chapter.\n\nHe started in show business in 1984 with talent manager the late Douglas Quijano. He then auditioned for the teen TV variety show \"That's Entertainment\" after attempting a career as a professional basketball player. He started with support roles in both comedy and drama. He was nominated by different award-giving bodies as Best Supporting Actor in the movie \"Itanong Mo sa Buwan\", starring opposite Jaclyn Jose and directed by Chito Rono.\n\nHis turning point in show business came in 1991, when he was given the role of Dino Tengco, the mentally disabled son of the crazy politician couple Barbara and Anding Tengco in the ABS-CBN satirical sitcom \"Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata\". He was awarded Best Comedy Actor by Star Awards in 1992 for his efforts. He was subsequently launched as a solo comedian and had several successful comedy films to his name, among them \"Dino, Abangan ang Susunod Na...\" (his launching movie), \"Pempe ni Sara at Pen\" (with Kris Aquino and Vandolph) and \"Milyonaryong Mini\" (with John Estrada and Sheryl Cruz). He also became part of the sitcoms \"Ober da Bakod\" (GMA Network) and \"Palibhasa Lalake\" (ABS-CBN).

He was known by the \"kunyas\" Abu Aqeel and Abu Yazid.\n\nHe was born c.581, the second son of Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad; hence he was a brother of Ali. He was said to be an expert in genealogy.\n\nHe married Fatima bint Al-Walid from the Abdshams clan of the Quraysh. He had seven sons: Muhammad, Muslim, Ja'far, Musa, Abdul Rahman, Abdullah and Abu Saeed; and a daughter, Ramla.\n\nAfter Muhammad departed from Mecca, Aqeel sold the houses of his Muslim relatives among the inhabitants of the city.\n\nHe fought on the side of the polytheists at the Battle of Badr, where he was taken prisoner. Muhammad is reported to have told his companions on the Day of Badr: \"Indeed I am aware that men from Banu Hashim, and others also, have been brought out under compulsion with no wish to fight us. If any of you encounters one from Banu Hashim then do not kill him\" Umar said that he should be handed over to Ali to have his head cut off; but Muhammad approved of Abu Bakr's opinion that he should be released on ransom. Since Aqeel had no money, he had to be redeemed by his uncle Abbas for 500 \"dinars\" or 40 ounces of gold. When Muhammad told him that Abu Jahl had been killed, Aqeel conceded that nobody would now challenge Muhammad's authority: \"Either people will be affected by your words, or you will dominate them by force.\"\n\nAqeel emigrated to Medina in mid-629, a year after Khaybar. Nevertheless, Muhammad granted him a pension of 140 \"wasqs\" from Khaybar. Aqeel and his children, due to their close relationship with Muhammad, were forbidden to receive anything from the alms tax.\n\nHe fought in the Battle of Mu'tah. It is said that soon after this, he fell ill and \"was not mentioned at\" the conquest of Mecca, the ambush at Hunayn or the siege of Ta'if. However, an alternative tradition indicates that he did in fact fight at Hunayn. When his wife asked him what plunder he had brought back from this battle, he replied: \"This needle. You can sew your garments with it,\" and he gave her his bloodstained sword. Later Muhammad ordered anyone who had taken anything from the plunder to return it. Aqeel told Fatima, \"By Allah, I think your needle is gone!\" and threw his sword into the plunder.\n\nLater Aqeel married a woman from the Jusham clan. When he was wished the traditional Arab wedding congratulation, \"May you live in harmony and have many sons,\" he responded, \"Say rather what Allah's Messenger said: 'May Allah bless you and bestow blessings upon you.'\"\n\nAqeel donated a carpet to the mosque in Medina. On Fridays it was spread out up the west wall. When the shadow of the wall covered the whole carpet, Umar knew it was time to come out for the midday prayer.\n\nAqeel was the fourth husband of Fatima, a sister of Hind bint Utbah. She was a wealthy woman who paid Aqeel to manage her property. She was said to be \"recalcitrant\" towards him; she often asked him about her father and uncle, who had been killed by the Muslim army. Aqeel once told her that they were in Hell, and their quarrel was so severe that Uthman assigned Muawiyah and Abd Allah ibn Abbas to mediate between them.\n\nAqeel was the man who found Umm ul-Banin to marry Ali.\n\nIn old age he became blind. He died in the caliphate of Muawiyah I, at the age of 96.\n\nDescendants of Aqeel are numerous and spread out across Yemen, parts of Oman and Somalia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39320762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39320762", "title": "Ariel Castro kidnappings", "text": "Ariel Castro kidnappings\n\nThe Ariel Castro kidnappings took place between 2002 and 2004 when three young women — Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Georgina \"Gina\" DeJesus — were kidnapped by Ariel Castro and held captive in his home in the Tremont neighborhood of Cleveland, in the U.S. state of Ohio. They were subsequently imprisoned until May 6, 2013, when Berry escaped with her six-year-old daughter and contacted the police. Knight and DeJesus were rescued by responding officers and Castro was arrested within hours.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, Castro was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison without the possibility of parole. One month into his sentence, Castro committed suicide by hanging himself with bedsheets in his prison cell.\n\nAriel Castro was born on July 11, 1960, in Yauco, Puerto Rico, to Pedro Castro and Lillian Rodriguez. When he was a child, his parents divorced. Shortly after the divorce, Castro moved to the mainland with his mother and three siblings. The family first settled in Reading, Pennsylvania, and later moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Castro's father and several other extended family members were living. Castro had nine siblings. According to Castro's uncle, his family knew the DeJesus family and had lived in the same West Cleveland neighborhood. Castro was a 1979 graduate of Cleveland's Lincoln-West High School.\n\nCastro met his future girlfriend, Grimilda Figueroa, when his family moved into a house across the street from hers in the 1980s. They lived with both sets of parents, but moved into their own home at 2207 Seymour Avenue in 1992. Their home was a two-story, , four-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a unfinished basement built in 1890 and remodeled in 1956. According to Figueroa's sister, Elida Caraballo, when the couple moved into their new home, \"all hell started breaking loose\". Caraballo and her husband Frank claim Castro beat Figueroa, breaking her nose, ribs, and arms. He also threw her down a flight of stairs, cracking her skull. In 1993, Castro was arrested for domestic violence but was not indicted by a grand jury.\n\nFigueroa moved out of the home in 1996 and secured custody of her four children. Police assisted in the move and detained Castro, but did not pursue charges. Castro continued to threaten and attack Figueroa after she left him, according to Caraballo. A 2005 filing by Figueroa in Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court accused Castro of inflicting multiple severe injuries on her and of \"frequently abduct[ing]\" her daughters. A temporary restraining order against Castro was granted, but was dismissed a few months later. Figueroa died in 2012 due to complications from a brain tumor.\n\nBefore his arrest at the age of 52, Castro worked as a bus driver for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District until he was fired for \"bad judgment\", including making an illegal U-turn with children on his bus, using his bus to go grocery shopping, leaving a child on the bus while he went for lunch, and leaving the bus unattended while he took a nap at home. He was earning $18.91 per hour when he was discharged. At the time of his arrest, Castro's home was in foreclosure due to three years (2010–12) of unpaid real estate taxes.\n\nAll of Castro's victims were kidnapped after accepting a ride from Castro. He drove each to his home, lured them inside, took them to the basement, and restrained them. The house at 2207 Seymour Avenue, where they were held, was located in Cleveland's residential Tremont neighborhood, where they had all disappeared. It has since been demolished.\n\nMichelle Knight (born April 23, 1981) disappeared on August 23, 2002, after leaving a cousin's house. She was 21 years old at the time. On the day of her disappearance, she was scheduled to appear in court for a child custody case involving her son, who was in the custody of the state.\n\nFollowing Knight's rescue, police acknowledged that limited resources had been spent on investigating her disappearance, in part because she was an adult. Knight was believed to have run away voluntarily due to anger over losing custody of her son. According to Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba, she \"was the focus of very few tips\". Her removal from the National Crime Information Center database fifteen months after she disappeared has been criticized. Cleveland Police and the FBI maintain that her inclusion or exclusion had no bearing on her rescue.\n\nAmanda Marie Berry (born April 22, 1986) disappeared on April 21, 2003, the day before her 17th birthday. She was last heard from when she called her sister to tell her that she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue. The FBI initially considered Berry a runaway until a week after her disappearance, when an unidentified male used her cell phone to call her mother, saying, \"I have Amanda. She's fine and will be coming home in a couple of days\".\n\nBerry was featured in a 2004 segment of Fox's \"America's Most Wanted\" (re-aired in 2005 and 2006), which linked her to Gina DeJesus, who by that point had also gone missing in Cleveland. Berry and DeJesus were profiled on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and \"The Montel Williams Show\", where in 2004 self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne told Berry's mother, Louwana Miller, that her daughter was dead and that she was \"in water\". This pronouncement devastated her mother, causing her to take down pictures and give away Berry's computer. However, Miller continued to search for Berry until her death from heart failure in 2006. After Berry was found alive in 2013, Browne received criticism for the false declaration that Berry was dead.\n\nIn July 2012, Robert Wolford, a prison inmate who previously lived in Tremont, claimed to have information about the location of Berry's body and led police to an empty lot on Cleveland's West Side, where a fruitless search was conducted. Wolford was sentenced in January 2013 to four-and-a-half years in prison for obstruction of justice, making a false report, and making a false alarm.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, Berry gave birth to a daughter at 2207 Seymour Avenue. DNA evidence has confirmed that Castro was the biological father of the child.\n\nGeorgina \"Gina\" Lynn DeJesus (born February 13, 1990) went missing at age 14. She was last seen at a payphone at about 3 p.m. on April 2, 2004, on the way home from her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain Avenue. DeJesus and her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene, had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied they could not and the two girls parted ways. Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.\n\nDeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an AMBER Alert was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father. He said in 2006, \"The Amber Alert should work for any missing child … Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law\".\n\nA year after DeJesus' disappearance, the FBI released a composite sketch and description of a male suspect, described as \"Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, , , with green eyes, a goatee and possibly a pencil-thin beard\". According to court records, Castro was , ; he had brown eyes and a goatee.\n\nDeJesus was featured in the aforementioned \"America's Most Wanted\" segment, which linked her to Berry. The disappearances received regular media attention over the years, continuing into 2012, while the families held public vigils. Castro attended at least two of these vigils, reportedly participated in a search party, and tried to get close to the DeJesus family. While a journalism student in 2004, Castro's son Anthony interviewed DeJesus's mother for an article about the disappearances in the \"Plain Press\". Police kept an active investigation open, offering a $25,000 reward for information.\n\nAfter Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women \"speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war, of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of emotional abuse, of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom\". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were \"emptied infrequently\". They were fed one meal a day, and allowed to shower twice a week at most.\n\nKnight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times, and had induced miscarriages each time through beatings: hitting with dumbbells, punching, and slamming her against walls. Starvation was also included. Knight's grandmother told reporters that she would require facial reconstruction surgery due to the beatings she endured; she also lost hearing in one ear. At one point, Knight had a pet dog while in captivity, but Castro killed the dog by snapping its neck after it bit him while trying to protect Knight. DeJesus told law enforcement she was raped but did not believe she was ever impregnated.\n\nIn December 2006, Castro allegedly ordered Knight to assist in the birth of Berry's child, which took place in a small inflatable swimming pool, and threatened to kill Knight if the baby did not survive. At one point, the baby stopped breathing, but Knight was able to resuscitate her. Castro occasionally took the child out of the house, including to visit his mother; the girl called Castro \"daddy\" and Castro's mother \"grandmother\". In 2013, he showed one of his adult daughters a picture of the child and said that she was his girlfriend's daughter from another man. He had told others who saw her that she was his granddaughter.\n\nAccording to a statement from Cleveland Police, officers visited Castro's home only once following the kidnappings to discuss an unrelated incident. Castro did not appear to be home at the time and was later interviewed elsewhere. Although neighbors claimed to have called the police about suspicious activity observed at the home, police have said they have no record of any such calls. Castro's son Anthony reported that there were certain areas of the house that were inaccessible due to being locked. He also mentioned an occasion where, three weeks before the women's escape, Castro asked him if Berry would ever be found. Anthony said he told Castro that Berry was likely dead, to which Castro responded: \"Really? You think so?\"\n\nNBC affiliate WKYC reported that during Castro's interrogation, he recalled each of the three abductions in great detail and indicated that they were unplanned crimes of opportunity. According to WKYC's sources, Castro did not have an \"exit plan\" and believed that he would eventually be caught. He referred to himself as \"coldblooded\" and a sex addict. Police found a suicide note in Castro's home in which he allegedly discussed the abductions and wrote that his money, videos and possessions should be given to the kidnapped women if he were caught.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, Berry was finally able to make contact with Castro's neighbors, leading to her escape with her 6-year-old daughter, and the rescue of DeJesus and Knight by authorities. According to police, when Castro left the house that day, Berry realized that he failed to lock the home's \"big inside door\", although the exterior storm door was bolted. She did not attempt to break through the outer door because \"she thought [Castro] was testing her\", according to the police report. Previously, Castro tested the women by leaving the house partially unlocked and exits unsecured. If they attempted to escape, he beat them. Instead, Berry screamed for help when she saw neighbors through the screen. \n\nNeighbor Angel Cordero responded to the screaming but was unable to communicate with Berry, because he spoke little English. Another neighbor, Charles Ramsey, joined Cordero at the house's front door during the rescue. A hole was kicked through the bottom of the storm door, and Berry crawled through, carrying her daughter; Ramsey said Berry told him that she and her child were being kept inside the house against her will. Upon being freed, she went to the house of another Spanish-speaking neighbor and called 9-1-1, saying;\n\nResponding police officers entered Castro's house. As they walked through an upstairs hallway with guns drawn, they announced themselves as Cleveland Police. After peeking out from a slightly opened bedroom door, Knight entered the hallway and leaped into an officer's arms, repeatedly saying, \"You saved me.\" Soon afterward, DeJesus entered the hallway from another room. Knight and DeJesus walked out of the home, and all three women, plus the child, were taken to MetroHealth Medical Center. Berry and DeJesus were released from the hospital the next day. Knight was discharged four days later, on May 10.\n\nCastro was arrested on May 6, 2013. He was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape on May 8, which carry prison sentences of ten years to life in Ohio. Two of Castro's brothers were also initially taken into custody, but were released on May 9 after police announced that they had no involvement in the kidnappings.\n\nCastro made his first court appearance at the Cleveland Municipal Court on May 9, where bail was set at $2 million per kidnapping charge, adding to a total of $8 million. Additional charges were reported to be pending, including aggravated murder (for intentional induction of miscarriages), attempted murder, assault, a charge for each alleged instance of rape, and a kidnapping charge for each day each captive was allegedly held. On May 14, Castro's attorneys said he would plead \"not guilty\" to all charges if indicted for kidnapping and rape.\n\nA Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment against Castro on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his alleged role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a death penalty specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings.\n\nAfter entering a not guilty plea for Castro on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against Castro were indisputable, \"it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty\". He noted, \"We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community\". Castro was found competent to stand trial on July 3.\n\nOn July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007. It brought the total to 977 counts: 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 of rape, seven of gross sexual imposition, six of felonious assault, three of child endangerment, two of aggravated murder, and one of possession of criminal tools. On July 17, Castro pleaded not guilty to the expanded indictment.\n\nCastro pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a plea bargain which called for consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 1,000 years, all without parole. Under the plea deal, Castro forfeited his right to appeal, and could not profit in any way due to his crimes. He also forfeited his assets, including his home, which prosecutors said would be demolished. Castro was told by Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Russo, \"You will not be getting out. Is that clear?\" to which Castro responded, \"I do understand that, your honor.\" Castro also made comments about his \"addiction to pornography\" and \"sexual problem\", but was cut off by Judge Russo, who said such issues could be discussed at the August 1 sentencing hearing. A law firm representing Berry, DeJesus, and Knight released a statement that the three women were \"relieved by today's plea. They are satisfied by this resolution to the case, and are looking forward to having these legal proceedings draw to a final close in the near future\".\n\nAt the sentencing hearing on August 1, Castro was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government. Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for twenty minutes, in which he said he was \"a good person\" and \"not a monster\", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had \"practiced the art of masturbation\" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that \"most\" of the sex he had with them \"was consensual\". He shifted between an apologetic tone and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as his victims themselves, insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: \"I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home\".\n\nThe sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: \"You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget.\"\n\nOn July 9, 2013, Knight, Berry, and DeJesus broke their public silence for the first time since their rescue by releasing a video statement thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said the women \"still have a strong desire for privacy\" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal. The Cleveland Courage Fund, a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life, had collected approximately $1.05 million at the time of the video's release. Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic Chevrolet Monte Carlo from the year Berry was born. He kept the car after her kidnapping, in case she was still found alive. After her rescue, Berry called her grandfather, and asked if he still had the car, which he did, although it was in need of restoration from having gone unused. Several automotive shops offered to perform the restoration for free.\n\nIn an interview with \"People\" magazine on the first anniversary of her rescue, Knight discussed some of her ordeals as well as her life leading up to her abduction. Since her rescue, she legally changed her first name to Lily, and began to get several tattoos as her way of coping with the healing process. Knight also revealed that her son was adopted by his foster parents while she was in captivity, and that while she wanted to see him, she does not want to bring him into the ordeal she has had to deal with, and planned to see him after he becomes an adult. Knight planned to open a restaurant, dreamed of getting married — which she did in 2016 — and adopt children. Knight also planned to reunite with Berry and DeJesus in the future, but began focusing on getting her own life back on track. Berry and DeJesus received honorary diplomas from John Marshall High School in 2015.\n\nAs part of the plea bargain, the house where Castro lived, and where he had held the women captive, was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons, which she said represented missing children, to the gathered crowd.

Prison staff performed CPR on Castro before he was taken to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The following day, Franklin County coroner Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary autopsy had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-erotic asphyxiation rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead. Castro was not on suicide watch at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.\n\nA consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that \"all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment.\" The Ohio State Highway Patrol also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.\n\n\n"}

Patrick Comerford Law and his wife, Frances \"nee\" Arbuthnot. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. From 1864 to 1872, he served in the Royal Scots Fusiliers.\n\nLaw began to act, making his professional stage debut in 1872 at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. He then toured the British provinces and played at London's Surrey Theatre for two years, after which joined the German Reed Entertainments in London in 1874. While performing with the German Reeds, he wrote nineteen short comic theatre works performed by the company. In 1877, Law married actress Fanny Holland, with whom he appeared with the German Reeds at the Gallery of Illustration and St. George's Hall. The couple had a son named Hamilton Patrick John Holland Law (born 1879).\n\nSome of Law's plays for the German Reeds include \"A Night Surprise\" in 1877 (under the pseudonym, \"West Cromer\"), \"A Happy Bungalow\" (1877), with music by Charles King Hall; \"Cherry Tree Farm\" (1881) and \"Nobody’s Fault\" (1882), both with music by Hamilton Clarke. In 1881, he wrote \"Uncle Samuel\", a curtain raiser for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company played at the Opera Comique, with music by George Grossmith. It played, together with \"Patience\", in 1881, and Law appeared in the role of John Bird. Law later appeared on stage at the Savoy Theatre as Mr. Wranglebury in the companion piece \"Mock Turtles\" in 1882, and as Major Murgatroyd in \"Patience\" in 1882, filling in for Frank Thornton.\n\nDuring a two-year period, from 1879 to 1881, Law and Holland performed on tour as \"Mr. & Mrs. Arthur Law's Entertainment,\" but the venture proved unsuccessful. He retired from acting following a final engagement at Savoy Theatre, in 1881, to turn his attention completely to writing.\n\nHis first \"serious\" drama, \"Hope\", was produced at London's Standard Theatre in 1882. That year he also wrote a musical farce, \"Mr. Guffin's Elopement\", in collaboration with George Grossmith, for Toole's Theatre, starring J. L. Toole. In 1885, Grossmith and Law wrote \"The Great Tay-Kin\", produced at Toole's.\n\nLaw wrote dozens of other plays. His best known include an adaptation of \"The Mystery of a Hansom Cab\", produced at the Princess's Theatre in 1888; \"The Judge\", produced at Terry's Theatre in 1890; \"The Magic Opal\" (an operetta with music by Isaac Albéniz) played at the Lyric Theatre and the Prince of Wales's Theatre in 1893; \"The New Boy\" at Terry's and the Vaudeville Theatre in 1894; \"The Sea Flower\" at the Comedy Theatre in 1898, \"A Country Mouse\" at the Prince of Wales's in 1902; \"The Bride and Bridegroom\" at the New Theatre in 1904; and \"Artful Miss Dearing\" at Terry's in 1909.\n\nA few of Law’s plays were also produced on Broadway, including \"The New Boy\" in 1894 at the Standard Theatre and \"A Country Mouse\" in 1902 at the Savoy Theatre. He also created the scenic design for \"The Bachelor\", by Clyde Fitch, in 1909 at the Maxine Elliott Theatre.\n\nLaw died in Parkstone, a suburb of Poole, Dorset, England at the age of 69.\n\n"}

{"id": "6140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6140", "title": "Claudius", "text": "Claudius\n\nClaudius (; ; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October 54 AD) was Roman emperor from 41 to 54. A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first (and until Trajan, only) Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37.\n\nClaudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius's and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire began the conquest of Britain (if the earlier invasions of Britain by Caesar and Caligula's aborted attempts are not counted). Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many senators. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife. After his death in 54 AD (at the age of 63), his grand-nephew, step-son, and adopted son Nero succeeded him as Emperor. His 13-year reign (slightly longer than Nero's) would not be surpassed by any successors until that of Domitian, who reigned for 15 years. \n\nHe was a descendant of the Octavii Rufi (through Gaius Octavius), Julii Caesares (through Julia Minor and Julia Antonia), and the Claudii Nerones (through Nero Claudius Drusus). He was a step-grandson (through his father Drusus) and great-nephew (through his mother Antonia Minor) of Augustus. He was a nephew of Tiberius through his father, Tiberius' brother. Through his brother Germanicus, Claudius was an uncle of Caligula and a great-uncle of Nero.\n\nClaudius was born on 1 August 10 BC at Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France). He had two older siblings, Germanicus and Livilla. His mother, Antonia, may have had two other children who died young.\n\nHis maternal grandparents were Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, Augustus' sister, and he was therefore the great-great grandnephew of Gaius Julius Caesar. His paternal grandparents were Livia, Augustus' third wife, and Tiberius Claudius Nero. During his reign, Claudius revived the rumor that his father Drusus was actually the illegitimate son of Augustus, to give the appearance that Augustus was Claudius' paternal grandfather.\n\nIn 9 BC, his father Drusus unexpectedly died on campaign in Germania, possibly from illness. Claudius was then left to be raised by his mother, who never remarried. When Claudius' disability became evident, the relationship with his family turned sour. Antonia referred to him as a monster, and used him as a standard for stupidity. She seems to have passed her son off to his grandmother Livia for a number of years.\n\nLivia was a little kinder, but nevertheless often sent him short, angry letters of reproof. He was put under the care of a \"former mule-driver\" to keep him disciplined, under the logic that his condition was due to laziness and a lack of will-power. However, by the time he reached his teenage years his symptoms apparently waned and his family took some notice of his scholarly interests.\n\nIn 7 AD, Livy was hired to tutor him in history, with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus. He spent a lot of his time with the latter and the philosopher Athenodorus. Augustus, according to a letter, was surprised at the clarity of Claudius' oratory. Expectations about his future began to increase.\n\nHis work as a budding historian damaged his prospects for advancement in public life. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, Claudius began work on a history of the Civil Wars that was either too truthful or too critical of Octavian—then reigning as Augustus Caesar. In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have convinced them that Claudius was not fit for public office. He could not be trusted to toe the existing party line.\n\nWhen he returned to the narrative later in life, Claudius skipped over the wars of the second triumvirate altogether. But the damage was done, and his family pushed him into the background. When the Arch of Pavia was erected to honor the Imperial clan in 8 BC, Claudius' name (now Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus after his elevation to paterfamilias of Claudii Nerones on the adoption of his brother) was inscribed on the edge—past the deceased princes, Gaius and Lucius, and Germanicus' children. There is some speculation that the inscription was added by Claudius himself decades later, and that he originally did not appear at all.\n\nWhen Augustus died in 14 AD, Claudius—then 23—appealed to his uncle Tiberius to allow him to begin the \"cursus honorum\". Tiberius, the new Emperor, responded by granting Claudius consular ornaments. Claudius requested office once more and was snubbed. Since the new Emperor was no more generous than the old, Claudius gave up hope of public office and retired to a scholarly, private life.\n\nDespite the disdain of the Imperial family, it seems that from very early on the general public respected Claudius. At Augustus' death, the \"equites\", or knights, chose Claudius to head their delegation. When his house burned down, the Senate demanded it be rebuilt at public expense. They also requested that Claudius be allowed to debate in the Senate. Tiberius turned down both motions, but the sentiment remained.\n\nDuring the period immediately after the death of Tiberius' son, Drusus, Claudius was pushed by some quarters as a potential heir. This again suggests the political nature of his exclusion from public life. However, as this was also the period during which the power and terror of the commander of the Praetorian Guard, Sejanus, was at its peak, Claudius chose to downplay this possibility.\n\nAfter the death of Tiberius, the new emperor Caligula (the son of Claudius' brother Germanicus) recognized Claudius to be of some use. He appointed Claudius his co-consul in 37 in order to emphasize the memory of Caligula's deceased father Germanicus. Despite this, Caligula relentlessly tormented his uncle: playing practical jokes, charging him enormous sums of money, humiliating him before the Senate, and the like. According to Cassius Dio Claudius became very sickly and thin by the end of Caligula's reign, most likely due to stress. A possible surviving portrait of Claudius from this period may support this.\n\nOn 24 January 41, Caligula was assassinated in a broad-based conspiracy involving the Praetorian commander Cassius Chaerea and several senators. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the assassination, although it has been argued that he knew about the plot—particularly since he left the scene of the crime shortly before his nephew was murdered. However, after the deaths of Caligula's wife and daughter, it became apparent that Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the Imperial family.\nIn the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the German guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including many of his friends. He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named Gratus found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him \"princeps\". A section of the guard may have planned in advance to seek out Claudius, perhaps with his approval. They reassured him that they were not one of the battalions looking for revenge. He was spirited away to the Praetorian camp and put under their protection.\n\nThe Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government, but this eventually devolved into an argument over which of them would be the new \"princeps\". When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval, but he refused, sensing the danger that would come with complying. Some historians, particularly Josephus, claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the Judaean King Herod Agrippa. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role so it remains uncertain. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.\n\nClaudius took several steps to legitimize his rule against potential usurpers, most of them emphasizing his place within the Julio-Claudian family. He adopted the name \"Caesar\" as a cognomen, as the name still carried great weight with the populace. In order to do so, he dropped the cognomen \"Nero\" which he had adopted as \"paterfamilias\" of the Claudii Nerones when his brother Germanicus was adopted out. As Pharaoh of Egypt, Claudius adopted the royal titulary \"Tiberios Klaudios, Autokrator Heqaheqau Meryasetptah, Kanakht Djediakhshuemakhet\" (\"Tiberius Claudius, Emperor and ruler of rulers, beloved of Isis and Ptah, the strong bull of the stable moon on the horizon\").\n\nWhile Claudius had never been formally adopted either by Augustus or his successors, he was nevertheless the grandson of Augustus' sister Octavia, and so he felt that he had the right of family. He also adopted the name \"Augustus\" as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific \"Germanicus\" to display the connection with his heroic brother. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term \"filius Drusi\" (son of Drusus) in his titles, in order to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.\n\nSince Claudius was the first Emperor proclaimed on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate, his repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as Seneca). Moreover, he was the first Emperor who resorted to bribery as a means to secure army loyalty and rewarded the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard that had elevated him with 15,000 sesterces. Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their wills, and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, however, issuing coins with tributes to the Praetorians in the early part of his reign.\n\nPliny the Elder noted, according to the 1938 Loeb Classical Library translation by Harris Rackham, \"... many people do not allow any gems in a signet-ring, and seal with the gold itself; this was a fashion invented when Claudius Cæsar was emperor.\"\n\nClaudius restored the status of the peaceful Imperial Roman provinces of Macedonia and Achaea as senatorial provinces.\n\nUnder Claudius, the Empire underwent its first major expansion since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of Thrace, Noricum, Pamphylia, Lycia, and Judea were annexed (or put under direct rule) under various circumstances during his term. The annexation of Mauretania, begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, and the official division of the former client kingdom into two Imperial provinces. The most far-reaching conquest was that of Britannia\".\nIn 43 AD, Claudius sent Aulus Plautius with four legions to Britain (\"Britannia\") after an appeal from an ousted tribal ally. Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its material wealth – particularly mines and slaves. It was also a haven for Gallic rebels and the like, and so could not be left alone much longer. Claudius himself traveled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements and elephants. The latter must have made an impression on the Britons when they were displayed in the large tribal centre of Camulodunum, modern day Colchester. The Roman \"colonia\" of \"Colonia Claudia Victricensis\" was established as the provincial capital of the newly established province of Britannia at Camulodunum, where a large Temple was dedicated in his honour.\n\nHe left after 16 days, but remained in the provinces for some time. The Senate granted him a triumph for his efforts. Only members of the Imperial family were allowed such honours, but Claudius subsequently lifted this restriction for some of his conquering generals. He was granted the honorific \"Britannicus\" but only accepted it on behalf of his son, never using the title himself. When the Briton general Caractacus was captured in 50 AD, Claudius granted him clemency. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.\n\nClaudius conducted a census in 48 that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens (adult males with Roman citizenship; women, children, slaves, and free adult males without Roman citizenship were not counted), an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket citizenship. These colonies were often made out of existing communities, especially those with elites who could rally the populace to the Roman cause. Several colonies were placed in new provinces or on the border of the Empire to secure Roman holdings as quickly as possible.\n\nClaudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law. He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system.\n\nHe extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 in order to ensure a more experienced jury pool.\n\nClaudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of Rhodes from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted Ilium (Troy) from taxes. Early in his reign, the Greeks and Jews of Alexandria sent him two embassies at once after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous \"Letter to the Alexandrians\", which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but also forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to Josephus, he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the Jews in the Empire.\n\nOne of Claudius's investigators discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the city of Tridentum (the modern Trento) were not in fact citizens. The Emperor issued a declaration, contained in the \"Tabula clesiana\", that they would be considered to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be laying false claim to membership of the Roman equestrian order were sold back into slavery.\n\nNumerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius' reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. A famous medical example is one promoting yew juice as a cure for snakebite. Suetonius wrote that he is even said to have thought of an edict allowing public flatulence for good health. One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the temple of Aesculapius on Tiber Island to die instead of providing them with medical assistance and care, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who were thus abandoned and recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take care of them were liable to be charged with murder.\n\nClaudius embarked on many public works throughout his reign, both in the capital and in the provinces. He built two aqueducts, the Aqua Claudia, begun by Caligula, and the Anio Novus. These entered the city in 52 AD and met at the Porta Maggiore. He also restored a third, the Aqua Virgo.\nHe paid special attention to transportation. Throughout Italy and the provinces he built roads and canals. Among these was a large canal leading from the Rhine to the sea, as well as a road from Italy to Germany – both begun by his father, Drusus. Closer to Rome, he built a navigable canal on the Tiber, leading to Portus, his new port just north of Ostia. This port was constructed in a semicircle with two moles and a lighthouse at its mouth. The construction also had the effect of reducing flooding in Rome.\n\nThe port at Ostia was part of Claudius' solution to the constant grain shortages that occurred in winter, after the Roman shipping season. The other part of his solution was to insure the ships of grain merchants who were willing to risk travelling to Egypt in the off-season. He also granted their sailors special privileges, including citizenship and exemption from the Lex Papia-Poppaea, a law that regulated marriage. In addition, he repealed the taxes that Caligula had instituted on food, and further reduced taxes on communities suffering drought or famine.\n\nThe last part of Claudius' plan was to increase the amount of arable land in Italy. This was to be achieved by draining the Fucine lake, which would have the added benefit of making the nearby river navigable year-round. A tunnel was dug through the lake bed, but the plan was a failure. The tunnel was crooked and not large enough to carry the water, which caused it to back up when opened. The resultant flood washed out a large gladiatorial exhibition held to commemorate the opening, causing Claudius to run for his life along with the other spectators. The draining of the lake continued to present a problem well into the Middle Ages. It was finally achieved by the Prince Torlonia in the 19th century, producing over of new arable land. He expanded the Claudian tunnel to three times its original size.\n\nBecause of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the Emperor sat among the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as holder of the power of Tribune (the Emperor could not officially serve as a Tribune of the Plebes as he was a Patrician, but it was a power taken by previous rulers). He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including Imperator) at the beginning of his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also put the Imperial provinces of Macedonia and Achaea back under Senate control.\n\nClaudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:\n\nIn 47 he assumed the office of \"censor\" with Lucius Vitellius, which had been allowed to lapse for some time. He struck the names of many senators and equites who no longer met qualifications, but showed respect by allowing them to resign in advance. At the same time, he sought to admit eligible men from the provinces. The Lyon Tablet preserves his speech on the admittance of Gallic senators, in which he addresses the Senate with reverence but also with criticism for their disdain of these men. He even jokes about how the Senate had admitted members from beyond Gallia Narbonensis (Lyons, France), i.e. himself. He also increased the number of Patricians by adding new families to the dwindling number of noble lines. Here he followed the precedent of Lucius Junius Brutus and Julius Caesar.\n\nNevertheless, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius reduced the Senate's power for the sake of efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an Imperial Procurator after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to Imperial appointees and freedmen. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the Emperor.\n\nSeveral coup attempts were made during Claudius' reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. Appius Silanus was executed early in Claudius' reign under questionable circumstances. Shortly after, a large rebellion was undertaken by the Senator Vinicianus and Scribonianus, the governor of Dalmatia, and gained quite a few senatorial supporters. It ultimately failed because of the reluctance of Scribonianus' troops, which led to the suicide of the main conspirators.\n\nMany other senators tried different conspiracies and were condemned. Claudius' son-in-law Pompeius Magnus was executed for his part in a conspiracy with his father Crassus Frugi. Another plot involved the consulars Lusiius Saturninus, Cornelius Lupus, and Pompeius Pedo.\n\nIn 46, Asinius Gallus, the grandson of Asinius Pollio, and Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus were exiled for a plot hatched with several of Claudius' own freedmen. Valerius Asiaticus was executed without public trial for unknown reasons. The ancient sources say the charge was adultery, and that Claudius was tricked into issuing the punishment. However, Claudius singles out Asiaticus for special damnation in his speech on the Gauls, which dates over a year later, suggesting that the charge must have been much more serious.\n\nAsiaticus had been a claimant to the throne in the chaos following Caligula's death and a co-consul with the Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus mentioned above. Most of these conspiracies took place before Claudius' term as Censor, and may have induced him to review the Senatorial rolls. The conspiracy of Gaius Silius in the year after his Censorship, 48, is detailed in the section discussing Claudius' third wife, Messalina. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius' reign. Needless to say, the responses to these conspiracies could not have helped Senate-emperor relations.\n\nClaudius was hardly the first emperor to use freedmen to help with the day-to-day running of the Empire. He was, however, forced to increase their role as the powers of the \"princeps\" became more centralized and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the Senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.\n\nThe secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedman. Narcissus was the secretary of correspondence. Pallas became the secretary of the treasury. Callistus became secretary of justice. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under Polybius until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for the Emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius' stead before the conquest of Britain.\n\nSince these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being placed in the hands of former slaves. If freedmen had total control of money, letters, and law, it seemed it would not be hard for them to manipulate the Emperor. This is exactly the accusation put forth by the ancient sources. However, these same sources admit that the freedmen were loyal to Claudius.\n\nHe was similarly appreciative of them and gave them due credit for policies where he had used their advice. However, if they showed treasonous inclinations, the Emperor did punish them with just force, as in the case of Polybius and Pallas' brother, Felix. There is no evidence that the character of Claudius' policies and edicts changed with the rise and fall of the various freedmen, suggesting that he was firmly in control throughout.\n\nRegardless of the extent of their political power, the freedmen did manage to amass wealth through their positions. Pliny the Elder notes that several of them were richer than Crassus, the richest man of the Republican era.\n\nClaudius, as the author of a treatise on Augustus' religious reforms, felt himself in a good position to institute some of his own. He had strong opinions about the proper form for state religion. He refused the request of Alexandrian Greeks to dedicate a temple to his divinity, saying that only gods may choose new gods. He restored lost days to festivals and got rid of many extraneous celebrations added by Caligula. He re-instituted old observances and archaic language.\n\nClaudius was concerned with the spread of eastern mysteries within the city and searched for more Roman replacements. He emphasized the Eleusinian mysteries which had been practiced by so many during the Republic. He expelled foreign astrologers, and at the same time rehabilitated the old Roman soothsayers (known as haruspices) as a replacement. He was especially hard on Druidism, because of its incompatibility with the Roman state religion and its proselytizing activities.\n\nClaudius forbade proselytizing in any religion, even in those regions where he allowed natives to worship freely.\n\nIt is also reported that at one time he expelled the Jews from Rome, probably because the Jews within the city caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters. Claudius also presided over many new and original events. Soon after coming into power, Claudius instituted games to be held in honor of his father on the latter's birthday. Annual games were also held in honour of his accession, and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed Emperor.\n\nClaudius organised a performance of the Secular Games, marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Augustus had performed the same games less than a century prior. Augustus' excuse was that the interval for the games was 110 years, not 100, but his date actually did not qualify under either reasoning. Claudius also presented naval battles to mark the attempted draining of the Fucine Lake, as well as many other public games and shows.\n\nAt Ostia, in front of a crowd of spectators, Claudius fought a killer whale which was trapped in the harbour. The event was witnessed by Pliny the Elder:\n\nClaudius also restored and adorned many public venues in Rome. At the Circus Maximus, the turning posts and starting stalls were replaced in marble and embellished, and an embankment was probably added to prevent flooding of the track. Claudius also reinforced or extended the seating rules that reserved front seating at the Circus for senators. Claudius rebuilt Pompey's Theatre after it had been destroyed by fire, organising special fights at the re-dedication which he observed from a special platform in the orchestra box.\n\nSuetonius and the other ancient authors accused Claudius of being dominated by women and wives, and of being a womanizer.\n\nClaudius married four times, after two failed betrothals. The first betrothal was to his distant cousin Aemilia Lepida, but was broken for political reasons. The second was to Livia Medullina, which ended with Medullina's sudden death on their wedding day.\n\nPlautia Urgulanilla was the granddaughter of Livia's confidant Urgulania. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, the daughter of Sejanus.\n\nClaudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius repudiated the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was allegedly one of his own freedmen. This action made him later the target of criticism by his enemies.\nSoon after (possibly in 28), Claudius married Aelia Paetina, a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, Claudia Antonia. He later divorced her after the marriage became a political liability, although Leon (1948) suggests it may have been due to emotional and mental abuse by Paetina.\n\nSome years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39, Claudius married Valeria Messalina, who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter, Claudia Octavia. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as Britannicus, was born just after Claudius' accession.\n\nThis marriage ended in tragedy. The ancient historians allege that Messalina was a nymphomaniac who was regularly unfaithful to Claudius—Tacitus states she went so far as to compete with a prostitute to see who could have the most sexual partners in a night—and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth. In 48, Messalina married her lover Gaius Silius in a public ceremony while Claudius was at Ostia.\n\nSources disagree as to whether or not she divorced the Emperor first, and whether the intention was to usurp the throne. Under Roman law, the spouse needed to be informed that he or she had been divorced before a new marriage could take place; the sources state that Claudius was in total ignorance until after the marriage. Scramuzza, in his biography, suggests that Silius may have convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed, and the union was her only hope of retaining rank and protecting her children. The historian Tacitus suggests that Claudius's ongoing term as Censor may have prevented him from noticing the affair before it reached such a critical point. Whatever the case, the result was the execution of Silius, Messalina, and most of her circle.\n\nClaudius did marry once more. The ancient sources tell that his freedmen put forward three candidates, Caligula's third wife Lollia Paulina, Claudius's divorced second wife Aelia Paetina and Claudius's niece Agrippina the Younger. According to Suetonius, Agrippina won out through her feminine wiles.\nThe truth is probably more political. The attempted coup d'état by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian but not the Julian family. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not yet have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy.\n\nAgrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Emperor Nero) was one of the last males of the Imperial family. Coup attempts could rally around the pair and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. It has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage, to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches. This feud dated back to Agrippina's mother's actions against Tiberius after the death of her husband Germanicus (Claudius's brother), actions which Tiberius had gladly punished. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son.\n\nNero was married to Claudius' daughter Octavia, made joint heir with the underage Britannicus, and promoted; Augustus had similarly named his grandson Postumus Agrippa and his stepson Tiberius as joint heirs, and Tiberius had named Caligula joint heir with his grandson Tiberius Gemellus. Adoption of adults or near adults was an old tradition in Rome, when a suitable natural adult heir was unavailable as was the case during Britannicus' minority. Claudius may have previously looked to adopt one of his sons-in-law to protect his own reign.\n\nFaustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, who was married to Claudius's daughter Claudia Antonia, was only descended from Octavia and Antony on one side – not close enough to the Imperial family to prevent doubts (although that did not stop others from making him the object of a coup attempt against Nero a few years later). Besides which, he was the half-brother of Valeria Messalina and at this time those wounds were still fresh. Nero was more popular with the general public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.\n\nThe historian Suetonius describes the physical manifestations of Claudius' affliction in relatively good detail. His knees were weak and gave way under him and his head shook. He stammered and his speech was confused. He slobbered and his nose ran when he was excited. The Stoic Seneca states in his \"Apocolocyntosis\" that Claudius' voice belonged to no land animal, and that his hands were weak as well.\n\nHowever, he showed no physical deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated he was a tall, well-built figure of \"dignitas\". When angered or stressed, his symptoms became worse. Historians agree that this condition improved upon his accession to the throne. Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his life.\n\nModern assessments of his health have changed several times in the past century. Prior to World War II, infantile paralysis (or polio) was widely accepted as the cause. This is the diagnosis used in Robert Graves' Claudius novels, first published in the 1930s. Polio does not explain many of the described symptoms, however, and a more recent theory implicates cerebral palsy as the cause, as outlined by Ernestine Leon. Tourette syndrome has also been considered a possibility.\n\nAs a person, ancient historians described Claudius as generous and lowbrow, a man who sometimes lunched with the plebeians. They also paint him as bloodthirsty and cruel, overly fond of gladiatorial combat and executions, and very quick to anger; Claudius himself acknowledged the latter trait, and apologized publicly for his temper. According to the ancient historians he was also overly trusting, and easily manipulated by his wives and freedmen. But at the same time they portray him as paranoid and apathetic, dull and easily confused.\n\nClaudius' extant works present a different view, painting a picture of an intelligent, scholarly, well-read, and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice. Thus, Claudius becomes an enigma. Since the discovery of his \"Letter to the Alexandrians\" in the last century, much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies.\n\nClaudius wrote copiously throughout his life. Arnaldo Momigliano states that during the reign of Tiberius – which covers the peak of Claudius' literary career – it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was to either write about the new empire or obscure antiquarian subjects. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both.\n\nBesides the history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included \"Tyrrhenica\", a twenty-book Etruscan history, and \"Carchedonica\", an eight-volume history of Carthage, as well as an Etruscan dictionary. He also wrote a book on dice-playing. Despite the general avoidance of the Republican era, he penned a defense of Cicero against the charges of Asinius Gallus. Modern historians have used this to determine the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history.\nHe proposed a reform of the Latin alphabet by the addition of three new letters, two of which served the function of the modern letters \"W\" and \"Y\". He officially instituted the change during his censorship but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste. Since Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) harshly criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches, it is not hard to imagine the nature of Suetonius' charge.\n\nNone of the works survive but live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius' autobiography once and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus uses Claudius' arguments for the orthographical innovations mentioned above and may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of Pliny's \"Natural History\".\n\nThe influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. The speech is meticulous in details, a common mark of all his extant works, and he goes into long digressions on related matters. This indicates a deep knowledge of a variety of historical subjects that he could not help but share. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by Julius Caesar. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.\n\nHis censorship seems to have been based on those of his ancestors, particularly Appius Claudius Caecus, and he used the office to put into place many policies based on those of Republican times. This is when many of his religious reforms took effect, and his building efforts greatly increased during his tenure. In fact, his assumption of the office of Censor may have been motivated by a desire to see his academic labors bear fruit. For example, he believed (as most Romans did) that his ancestor Appius Claudius Caecus had used the censorship to introduce the letter \"R\" and so used his own term to introduce his new letters.\n\nThe consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison—possibly contained in mushrooms or on a feather—and died in the early hours of 13 October 54 AD.\n\nNearly all implicate his final wife, Agrippina, as the instigator. Agrippina and Claudius had become more combative in the months leading up to his death. This carried on to the point where Claudius openly lamented his bad wives, and began to comment on Britannicus' approaching manhood with an eye towards restoring his status within the imperial family. Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.\n\nSome implicate either his taster Halotus, his doctor Xenophon, or the infamous poisoner Locusta as the administrator of the fatal substance. Some say he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at dinner, and some have him recovering only to be poisoned again. Among contemporary sources, Seneca the Younger ascribed the emperor's death to natural causes, while Josephus only spoke of rumors on his poisoning.\n\nIn modern times, some authors have cast doubt on whether Claudius was murdered or merely succumbed to illness or old age. Some modern scholars claim the near universality of the accusations in ancient texts lends credence to the crime. Claudius' ashes were interred in the Mausoleum of Augustus on 24 October 54 AD, after a funeral similar to that of his great-uncle Augustus 40 years earlier.\n\nAlready, while alive, he received the widespread private worship of a living Princeps and was worshipped in Britannia in his own temple in Camulodunum.\n\nClaudius was deified by Nero and the Senate almost immediately. Those who regard this homage as cynical should note that, cynical or not, such a move would hardly have benefited those involved, had Claudius been \"hated\", as some commentators, both modern and historic, characterize him. Many of Claudius' less solid supporters quickly became Nero's men. Claudius' will had been changed shortly before his death to either recommend Nero and Britannicus jointly or perhaps just Britannicus, who would have been considered an adult man according to Roman law only a few months later.\n\nAgrippina had sent away Narcissus shortly before Claudius' death, and now murdered the freedman. The last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius' correspondence—most likely so it could not be used against him and others in an already hostile new regime. Thus Claudius' private words about his own policies and motives were lost to history. Just as Claudius had criticized his predecessors in official edicts (see below), Nero often criticized the deceased Emperor and many of Claudius' laws and edicts were disregarded under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them.\n\nSeneca's Apocolocyntosis mocks the deification of Claudius and reinforces the view of Claudius as an unpleasant fool; this remained the official view for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all, and realigned with his birth family. Claudius' temple was left unfinished after only some of the foundation had been laid down. Eventually the site was overtaken by Nero's Golden House.\n\nThe Flavians, who had risen to prominence under Claudius, took a different tack. They were in a position where they needed to shore up their legitimacy, but also justify the fall of the Julio-Claudians. They reached back to Claudius in contrast with Nero, to show that they were good associated with good. Commemorative coins were issued of Claudius and his son Britannicus, who had been a friend of the Emperor Titus (Titus was born in 39, Britannicus was born in 41). When Nero's Golden House was burned, the Temple of Claudius was finally completed on the Caelian Hill.\n\nHowever, as the Flavians became established, they needed to emphasize their own credentials more, and their references to Claudius ceased. Instead, he was lumped with the other emperors of the fallen dynasty. His state cult in Rome probably continued until the abolition of all such cults of dead Emperors by Maximinus Thrax in 237–238. The \"Feriale Duranum\", probably identical to the festival calendars of every regular army unit, assigns him a sacrifice of a steer on his birthday, the Kalends of August. And such commemoration (and consequent feasting) probably continued until the Christianization and disintegration of the army in the late 4th century.\n\nThe main ancient historians Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio all wrote after the last of the Flavians had gone. All three were senators or \"equites\". They took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the Princeps, invariably viewing him as being in the wrong. This resulted in biases, both conscious and unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to rely on second-hand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of Augustus' letters, which had been gathered earlier). Suetonius painted Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and attributing the objectively good works to his retinue.\n\nTacitus wrote a narrative for his fellow senators and fitted each of the emperors into a simple mold of his choosing. He wrote of Claudius as a passive pawn and an idiot in affairs relating to the palace and often in public life. During his censorship of 47-8 Tacitus allows the reader a glimpse of a Claudius who is more statesmanlike (XI.23-25), but it is a mere glimpse. Tacitus is usually held to have 'hidden' his use of Claudius' writings and to have omitted Claudius' character from his works. Even his version of Claudius' Lyons tablet speech is edited to be devoid of the Emperor's personality. Dio was less biased, but seems to have used Suetonius and Tacitus as sources. Thus the conception of Claudius as the weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was preserved for the ages.\n\nAs time passed, Claudius was mostly forgotten outside of the historians' accounts. His books were lost first, as their antiquarian subjects became unfashionable. In the 2nd century, Pertinax, who shared his birthday, became emperor, overshadowing commemoration of Claudius.\n\n\nIn literature, Claudius and his contemporaries appear in the historical novel \"The Roman\" by Mika Waltari. Canadian-born science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt reimagined Robert Graves' Claudius story, in his two novels, \"Empire of the Atom\" and \"The Wizard of Linn\".\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

Harney reportedly inspired the creation in 1994 of the Shundahai Network, which works for environmental justice and nuclear disarmament. The Shundahai Network plays a key role in organizing non-violent civil disobedience aimed at bringing about the closure of the Nevada Test Site, which is located on Western Shoshone land.\n\nHarney devoted his life to working to save the land on which his people have survived for thousands of years. The Newe people and Newe Sogobia have been referred to as \"the most bombed people on Earth\" and \"the most bombed place on Earth\" as the United States Government has exploded more than 1,000 nuclear weapons at the Nevada Test Site, which is located on Western Shoshone land. The government has dumped highly radioactive nuclear waste there.\n\n\"The food that my people survived on is not here no more on account of this nuclear weapon that we have developed,\" Harney explains. \"The pine nuts aren't here no more, the chokecherries aren't here, the antelope aren't here, the deer aren't here, the groundhog aren't here, the sagehen aren't here.\"\n\nSometimes called \"The hardest working man in shamanism\", Harney, for many years, spent most of his time travelling around the world spreading a message about the dangers of nuclear energy and the problems facing our Mother Earth. \"The Mother Earth provides us with food, provides us with air, provides us with water. We, the people, are going to have to put our thoughts together, to save our planet here. We've only got one water, one air, one Mother Earth.\" Among other excursions, he visited mutated children in Kazakhstan hospitals who lived close to the Russian nuclear test \nsite. He received the 2003 International Nuclear Free Future Solutions award.\n\nHarney's formal education ended when he ran away from Indian boarding school at the age of nine because of his feelings of how his schoolmates were mistreated by their teachers. However, he was able to talk to students, government officials, and members of the public about toxins of all kinds: chemicals from mining and industry, and, worst of all, nuclear fallout and radiation poisoning from nuclear testing, nuclear waste storage, and nuclear waste transportation that takes place over regular railroads and highways.\n\nHe spoke out about the contamination of our water and shared with people a vision that he experienced several years ago. \"I was praying to the water and the spirit of the water told me, 'Pretty soon, I'm going to look like clean water, but no one is going to use me'. I didn't really understand what I was told until I went to Kazakhstan in Russia. Kazakhstan is where Russia tested nuclear bombs for many years. Over there I saw water that looks like clean water, but people can't drink it because it is contaminated with radiation ... [t]he nature put all the living things here for us to take care of, not to destroy them, but to work with them so that we may live with them for many more years.\"\n\nHarney stated a firm belief in communication with the natural elements and all living things and numerous other people have witnessed the results of his work, including rain in drought areas, dry springs which started flowing once more, plants flourishing where they were sparse before and the return of animals that had not been seen in their native habitats for many years .\n\n\"We have to come back to the Native way of life. The Native way is to pray for everything. Our Mother Earth is very important. Everything survives on our Mother, the only Mother we've got. We can't just misuse her and think she's going to continue. Let's not destroy the Mother Earth. Let's take care of her and she will take care of us.\"\n\nShortly before his death, Harney completed arrangements for the publication of his second book, \"The Nature Way\", in which he shares the traditional knowledge that his people, the Newe, have followed since time immemorial. In 1994 he founded the Shundahai Network (\"shundahai\" translates to \"peace and harmony with all creation\") where he remained as board chair until his death. He was also the founder and director of Poo Ha Bah, a traditional healing center in Tecopa, California.\n\n\"I have established Poo-Ha-Bah for all the people. Poo-Ha-Bah in my language is a very important word--it's talking about Doctor Water. It's really important to have healing water here, not only as a human--a lot of animal life have used healing water, a lot of different ways. My people have always traveled for many miles to get into different kinds of healing waters. This is something that we all need, and this is one reason I have looked for healing water and I finally found one in Tecopa, California. I am pretty sure that we all will enjoy the healing water if we ask the healing water to help us with our illness of all different kinds. This is something that our people have talked about for many, many years.\"\n\nHarney was a proponent of universal inclusion and individual spiritual empowerment, \"We need your help. Who ever you are, whatever color you are, wherever you come from on this Mother Earth of ours. We've only got this one Earth and we all have to take care of it. So I am asking all of you people throughout the world to unite yourselves together. Give us a helping hand so we can take care of all the living things.\"\n\nHarney's experiences with victims of the nuclear industry throughout the world, and particularly the \"Downwinders\" of the Western United States, along with the powerful message he carried of peace and respect for our planet, lent unique credibility to his words. Typical of his international work was acting as keynote speaker at the Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Conference, in 2001, in Nagasaki, Japan, where he was able to speak with other still-recovering survivors of nuclear war .\n\nTrained from childhood in the traditional Newe ways of medicine and spirituality (the two are not viewed separately), Harney noted the extinction of medicinal plants due to the toxins of mining, and the disappearance of many birds and other animals that once roamed the Newe homelands. Beginning in 1957, he worked with medicine women of Battle Mountain, Nevada, running the Sundance Ceremony and sweat lodges as well as helping sick people. As a medicine person, he also worked steadily to preserve and protect the sacred sites and burial grounds of his people. He was raised to view all life as sacred. \"Everything is alive and has a spirit to it. The rocks, the mountains, streams, animals, plants, birds, oceans, and so forth,\" he says.\n\nHarney warned of a quickly approaching time when the Earth is so contaminated by the results of human activity that all the water on the planet will be toxic to all forms of life. His vision, however, was not fatalistic. He remained convinced that humans have the power to turn things around, saying \"The water has a life, and we have to pray for it. All the water that comes from the Mother Earth, that's her blood.\".\n\nHarney affirmed that healing and well-being are everyone's business, and that no one is powerless. \"Yes, you can. All of us are gifted. We just need to open up the gifts by praying in our own way, singing our own songs and talking to everything out there with love and respect. Don't feel foolish. This is how everything has been sustained for millions of years. This will open up a totally new world for you. Amazing things will happen if you are patient. This is how we will heal ourselves and our Mother Earth.\"\n\nHe died of cancer which had metastasized into his bones.\n\n\n"}

He made his living by exhibiting himself for money; he appeared in many European countries and attracted the interest of scientists and laypeople, including royalty. After his death, portions of his skeleton found their way into museums, where some parts still remain.\n\nCajanus was born in Paltamo, Oulu, Finland, the son of a clergyman. Finland was at that time part of Sweden, and Cajanus was often referred to as the \"Swedish Giant\". Estimates of his adult height vary and range as high as . Jan Bondeson, a medical professional and author who has researched and written on Cajanus, suggests that his true height was around , supported by contemporaneous accounts in the \"London Annual Register\". Various unconfirmed versions of his early life exist, but tax records indicate he may have left the country in 1723 or soon afterward, and Finnish and Swedish tradition recounts that he joined the bodyguard of Frederick William I of Prussia, which was composed of unusually tall soldiers and was nicknamed the Potsdam Giants.\n\nCajanus lived for some years at the court of August II of Poland, where he served as a cavalry soldier. Following the king's death in 1733 he appears to have moved on, and according to Theophilus Cibber spent time in Germany before arriving in London, where he is recorded as having appeared at Drury Lane in February 1734, playing the part of Gargantua in the pantomime \"Cupid and Psyche\", and in several other productions. He exhibited himself for money in various places in London, billed as the \"Swedish Giant\". His portrait was painted twice during his stay in England by the artist Enoch Seeman; one of these portraits is now in the National Museum of Finland and depicts him in his Polish soldier's uniform, with an inscription stating his height as . In 1735 he traveled to Paris, where he exhibited himself to paying audiences and was received privately at Versailles by Louis XV, the queen and the dauphin. Later he took up residence in Amsterdam, where he lived from 1735 to 1741 as the guest of the landlord of the Blauw Jan, an inn where natural curiosities could be seen and traded. After an unsuccessful spell as a moneylender Cajanus returned to exhibiting himself, visiting England again in 1741 and 1742 and appearing before a meeting of the Royal Society, where his height was marked against a pillar and reported to be in his shoes. The society's president Martin Folkes observed that Cajanus appeared weak at this meeting, and could not stand for long.\n\nThe publisher Thomas Boreman met Cajanus during his visit to London in 1742 and produced a book purporting to be his biography. \"The History of Cajanus, the Swedish Giant, from his Birth to the Present Time\" was published on 23 September of that year, and advertisements for it encouraged the reader to visit the exhibition opposite the Mansion House where Cajanus himself could be seen.\n\nCajanus was quite popular in the Netherlands. In 1745 Cajanus settled in Haarlem, Netherlands, where he bought the right to live in the Proveniershuis, a sheltered housing unit that provided him with accommodation, meals and medical care. In the following years he wrote and published poetry and became a well-known figure in the town; a line marked on a pillar in the city's Grote Kerk still records his measured height during his residence there.\n\nCajanus died on 27 February 1749, leaving a large sum in his will to pay for a lavish funeral and a burial vault inside the Grote Kerk, with the intention of safeguarding his remains from disturbance. His coffin is said to have been long. Despite his precautions, the vault was later sold, and Cajanus's bones were acquired by museums. Some are still held at the Museum of Anatomy in the University of Leiden. Today the Dutch language still remembers him with the slang term \"Cajanus voeten\", for unusually large feet. In period writings, the term \"Cajaan\" was used to mean a giant.\n\nDaniel Cajanus apparently suffered from gigantism caused by a defect of the pituitary, possibly combined with hypogonadism. This is indicated by the fact that Cajanus' bodily proportions, and especially his strikingly long arms, were consistent with those of eunuchs, and by his apparently limited interest in the opposite sex.\n\nA tendency towards gigantism was displayed more broadly in his family. His sister Agneta, who went to Haarlem after his death to deal with his estate, was depicted as an especially large woman. A distant relative, Israel Cajanus, had extremely large hands and feet and thus probably also suffered from acromegaly.\n\nThe available information about Daniel Cajanus' actual size is somewhat variable, however it is clear that his height reduced somewhat over the course of his life. Investigations into his preserved bones reveal a phenomenon typical of gigantism which explains this reduction: the overproduction of growth hormone leads to a thickening of the cartilage, which wears away in the course of time, leading to symptoms similar to osteoarthritis.

Burnand\n\nSir Francis Cowley Burnand (29 November 1836 – 21 April 1917), usually known as F. C. Burnand, was an English comic writer and prolific playwright, best known today as the librettist of Arthur Sullivan's opera \"Cox and Box\".\n\nThe son of a prosperous family, he was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and was expected to follow a conventional career in the law or in the church, but he concluded that his vocation was the theatre. From his schooldays he had written comic plays, and from 1860 until the end of the 19th century, he produced a series of more than 200 Victorian burlesques, farces, pantomimes and other stage works. His early successes included the burlesques \"Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel\" (1863) and \"The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up\" (1866). Also in 1866, he adapted the popular farce \"Box and Cox\" as a comic opera, \"Cox and Box\", with music by Sullivan. The piece became a popular favourite and was later frequently used by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a curtain raiser; it remains regularly performed today.\n\nBy the 1870s, Burnand was generating a prodigious output of plays as well as comic pieces and illustrations for the humour magazine \"Punch\". Among his 55-stage works during the decade was another frequently revived hit, \"Betsy\" (1879). For \"Punch\", among other things, he wrote the popular column \"Happy Thoughts\", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. Also admired were his burlesques of other writers' works. Burnand was a contributor to \"Punch\" for 45 years and its editor from 1880 until 1906 and is credited with adding much to the popularity and prosperity of the magazine. His editorship of the original publication of \"The Diary of a Nobody\" by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith was a high point of his tenure in 1888–89. Many of his articles were collected and published in book form. His stage successes in the 1890s included his English-language versions of two Edmond Audran operettas, titled \"La Cigale\" and \"Miss Decima\" (both in 1891). His last works included collaborations on pantomimes of \"Cinderella\" (1905) and \"Aladdin\" (1909).\n\nKnown generally for his genial wit and good humor, Burnand was nevertheless intensely envious of his contemporary W. S. Gilbert but was unable to emulate his rival's success as a comic opera librettist. In other forms of theatre Burnand was outstandingly successful, with his works receiving London runs of up to 550 performances and extensive tours in the British provinces and the US. He published several humorous books and memoirs and was knighted in 1902 for his work on \"Punch\".\n\nBurnand was born in central London, the only child of Francis Burnand and his first wife Emma, \"née\" Cowley, who died when her son was eight days old. Burnand senior, a stockbroker, was descended from an old Savoyard family, prominent in the silk trade; his wife was a descendant of the poet and dramatist Hannah Cowley.\n\nBurnand was educated at Eton, where, aged fifteen, he wrote a farce, \"Guy Fawkes Day\", played at Cookesley's house, and subsequently at the Theatre Royal, Worthing. While at Eton, he submitted some illustrations to the comic weekly magazine, \"Punch\", one or two of which were published. In 1854 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where as an undergraduate he sought the approval of the Vice-Chancellor, Edwin Guest, of the establishment of a Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, with a performance of \"Box and Cox\". Guest and his colleagues refused their consent, but Burnand went ahead without it. The members of the club performed a triple bill under stage names to avoid retribution from the university. The club prospered (and continues to the present day); Burnand acted and wrote plays under the name Tom Pierce.\n\nBurnand graduated in 1858. His family had expected that he would study for the bar, but the Burnands held the right to appoint the incumbent of a Church of England parish that became vacant, and it was agreed that he should train for the priesthood. He enrolled at Cuddesdon theological college, where his studies of divinity led him to leave the Anglican church and become a Roman Catholic. This caused a breach between Burnand and his father, but the estrangement did not last long. To the disappointment of Cardinal Manning, leader of the English Catholics, Burnand announced that his vocation was not for the church but for the theatre. Father and son were reconciled, and Burnand returned to his original plan of reading for the bar at Lincoln's Inn.\n\nIn February 1860 Burnand had his first piece performed in the West End, \"Dido the Celebrated Widow\", a musical burlesque of \"Dido and Aeneas\", played at the St James's Theatre. The following month he married an actress, Cecilia Victoria Ranoe (1841–1870), daughter of James Ranoe, a clerk; the couple had five sons and two daughters. He was called to the bar in 1862, and practised for a short time, but his main interest was in writing. In the early 1860s, he edited the short-lived journal \"The Glow-Worm\" and then joined the staff of \"Fun\", edited by H. J. Byron. He parted company with Byron when the magazine rejected his proposed 1863 literary burlesque of a Reynolds serial, entitled \"Mokeanna, or the White Witness\". He showed his manuscript to Mark Lemon, editor of \"Punch\", who accepted it for publication; Burnand remained a \"Punch\" writer for the rest of his career.\n\n\"Dido\" was followed by \"The Îles of St Tropez\" (1860), \"Fair Rosamond\" (1862) and \"The Deal Boatman\" (1863), among many others. His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, \"Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel\" (1863), starring Lydia Thompson in the title role, which found audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For \"Ixion\" this brought him a total of around £3,000. Other notable early works included an opéra bouffe, \"Windsor Castle\" (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including \"Helen, or, Taken from the Greek\", and \"Guy Fawkes, or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons\", both in 1866. Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque \"The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up\", parodying the three-act melodrama by Douglas Jerrold, \"Black-Eyed Susan\"; the show ran for 400 nights at the Royalty Theatre, was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.\nIn 1866, Burnand adapted the popular farce \"Box and Cox\" as a comic opera, \"Cox and Box\", with music by the young composer Arthur Sullivan. The piece was written for a private performance but was repeated and given its first public performance at the Adelphi Theatre in 1867. The reviewer for \"Fun\" was W. S. Gilbert, who wrote\n\n\"Cox and Box\" became a popular favourite and was frequently revived. It was the only work not by Gilbert in the regular repertory of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company during the 20th century and is the only work of Burnand's still frequently staged. Its success encouraged its authors to write the two-act opera, \"The Contrabandista\" (1867), revised and expanded as \"The Chieftain\" (1894), but it did not achieve much popularity in either version.\n\nMore burlesques followed in 1868, including \"Fowl Play, or, A Story of Chicken Hazard\" and \"The Rise and Fall of Richard III, or, A New Front to an Old Dicky\". In 1869, Burnand wrote \"The Turn of the Tide\", which was a success at the Queen's Theatre, and six other stage works during the course of the year.\n\nBurnand's wife Cecilia died in 1870 at age 28, leaving him with seven small children. In 1874 Burnand married her widowed sister, Rosina (d. 1924), who was also an actress. It was at that time illegal in England for a man to marry his dead wife's sister, although such marriages made outside British jurisdiction were recognised as valid; accordingly the wedding ceremony was performed in continental Europe. There were two sons and four daughters of this marriage.\n\nThroughout the 1870s, Burnand maintained a prodigious output. For the stage he wrote 55 pieces, ranging from burlesques to pantomimes, farces and extravaganzas. He was the sole author of most of them, but worked on a few with Thomas German Reed, J. L. Molloy, Henry Pottinger Stephens and even with H. J. Byron. His stage pieces of the 1870s included \"Poll and Partner Joe\" (1871), \"Penelope Anne\" (1871; a sequel to \"Cox and Box\"), \"The Miller and His Man\" (1873; \"a Christmas drawing room extravaganza\" with songs by Sullivan), \"Artful Cards\" (1877), \"Proof\" (1878), \"Dora and Diplunacy\" (1878, a burlesque of Clement Scott's \"Diplomacy\", an adaptation of Sardou's \"Dora\"), \"The Forty Thieves\" (1878; a charity collaboration among four playwrights, including Byron and Gilbert), \"Our Club\" (1878) and another frequently revived hit, \"Betsy\" (1879). He provided a burlesque of \"Robbing Roy\" to the Gaiety Theatre in 1979. Burnand's prolific writing came at some cost in quality. A biographer wrote that he \"was a facile and slapdash writer. False rhymes and awkward rhythms occur frequently in his verse, and his favourite devices included puns, topical references and slang.\"\n\nBurnand also translated or adapted for the London stage several French operettas by Offenbach, Edmond Audran, Charles Lecocq and Robert Planquette. At the same time as his busy theatrical career, he was a member of the staff of \"Punch\" under Lemon and his successors, Shirley Brooks and Tom Taylor, writing a regular stream of genial articles. His best-known work for the magazine was the column \"Happy Thoughts\", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. A. A. Milne considered it \"one of the most popular series which has ever appeared in \"Punch\"\"; alongside it, he rated as Burnand's best comic contributions his burlesques of other writers, such as \"The New History of Sandford and Merton\" (1872) and \"Strapmore\" by \"Weeder\" (1878).\n\nThe third editor of \"Punch\", Tom Taylor, died in July 1880; the proprietors of the magazine appointed Burnand to succeed him. In Milne's view the magazine's reputation increased considerably under Burnand:\n\nA later biographer, Jane Stedman, writes, \"His predecessor, Tom Taylor, had allowed the paper to become heavy, but Burnand's rackety leadership brightened it.\" Burnand, who declared himself \"hostile to no man's religion\", banned \"Punch\"'s previous anti-Catholicism, although he was unable to prevent some antisemitic jokes.\n\nOne of Burnand's biggest successes, both in \"Punch\" and on stage, was satire of the aesthetic movement. His play \"The Colonel\" (1881), based on \"The Serious Family\", a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce that he was able to build the Prince of Wales Theatre. Burnand rushed \"The Colonel\" into production to make sure that it opened several months before Gilbert and Sullivan's similarly themed comic opera, \"Patience\", but \"Patience\" ran even longer than \"The Colonel\". Oscar Wilde, no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing \"Patience\": \"With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of \"The Colonel\"\". For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of \"The Tempest\" entitled \"Ariel\" in October 1883, with music by Meyer Lutz, starring Nellie Farren and Arthur Williams. \"The Times\" complained of the \"flatness and insipidity\" of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original. \"The Observer\" was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.\n\nIn 1884, Burnand wrote \"Paw Claudian\", a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama \"Claudian\" by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills, presented at Toole's Theatre starring J. L. Toole. The same year, he wrote a burlesque of \"Black-Eyed Susan\", called \"Black Eyed See-Usan\", for the Alhambra Theatre. Burnand wrote several musical works around 1889 and 1890 with the composer Edward Solomon, including \"Pickwick\", which was revived in 1894. \"Pickwick\" was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with George Grossmith's \"Cups and Saucers\". Other stage pieces included adaptations for Augustine Daly in New York.\n\nIn 1890, Burnand wrote \"Captain Therèse,\" followed later that year by a very successful English version of Audran's operetta, \"La cigale et la fourmi\" (the grasshopper and the ant) retitled \"La Cigale\", with additional music by Ivan Caryll. In 1891, he produced an English adaptation of Audran's \"Miss Helyett\", retitled as \"Miss Decima\". Burnand's \"The Saucy Sally\" premiered in 1892, and \"Mrs Ponderbury's Past\" played in 1895. Burnand's 1897 comic opera, \"His Majesty\", with music by Alexander Mackenzie, failed despite the contributions of the lyricist Adrian Ross and a Savoy Theatre cast including Ilka Pálmay, George Grossmith and Walter Passmore. The blame was generally held to be Burnand's. \"The Times\" commented, \"Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case.\" Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was \"marked by distinction as well as humour.\" Stedman comments that Burnand's conviction that he, not Gilbert, should have been Sullivan's main collaborator defied the facts: \"The Chieftain\", his rewrite of \"The Contrabandista\" with Sullivan, ran for only 97 performances in 1894, and \"His Majesty\" managed only 61 performances. Nevertheless, Burnand used his position as editor of \"Punch\" to print antagonistic reviews of the plays of Gilbert and refused to give the Gilbert and Sullivan operas reviews in the magazine.\n\nBurnand's last stage works were a collaboration with J. Hickory Wood, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1905, on a pantomime of \"Cinderella\", and he was partly responsible for a pantomime of \"Aladdin\" for the same theatre in 1909. His later contributions to \"Punch\" became increasingly wordy and anecdotal, relying on far-fetched puns, but he was a good judge of talent, and under him the paper prospered. Stedman rates as a high point of his editorship the publication of \"The Diary of a Nobody\" by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith, which was soon turned into book form and has never been out of print. He was reluctant to retire, but was persuaded to do so in 1906, and was succeeded by Owen Seaman. In 1908, Burnand became the editor of \"The Catholic Who's Who\", published by Burns & Oates.\n\nBurnand lived for much of his life in Ramsgate, Kent, on the south coast of England and was a member of the Garrick Club in London. He had a very large circle of friends and colleagues who included William Makepeace Thackeray, Mark Lemon and most writers, dramatists and actors of the day. George Grossmith wrote:\nAfter a winter of bronchitis, Burnand died in 1917 at his home in Ramsgate, at the age of 80. He was buried in the cemetery at St Augustine's Abbey church in Ramsgate.\n\nBurnand's best-known book, \"Happy Thoughts\", was originally published in \"Punch\" in 1863–64 and frequently reprinted. This was followed by \"My Time and What I've Done with It\" (1874); \"Personal Reminiscences of the A.D.C., Cambridge,\" (1880); \"The Incomplete Angler\" (1887); \"Very Much Abroad\" (1890); \"Rather at Sea\" (1890); \"Quite at Home\" (1890); \"The Real Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" (1893); and \"Records and Reminiscences,\" in 1904.\n\n\n\n"}

He became one of the most influential and admired British generals after a series of successes in Canada, West Africa, and Egypt, followed by a central role in modernizing the British Army in promoting efficiency. He served in Burma, the Crimean War, the Indian Mutiny, China, Canada and widely throughout Africa—including his Ashanti campaign (1873–1874) and the Nile Expedition against Mahdist Sudan in 1884–85. Wolseley served as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces from 1895 to 1900. His reputation for efficiency led to the late 19th century English phrase \"everything's all Sir Garnet\", meaning, \"All is in order.\"\n\nLord Wolseley was born into a prominent Anglo-Irish family in Dublin, the eldest son of Major Garnet Joseph Wolseley of the King's Own Scottish Borderers (25th Foot) and Frances Anne Wolseley (\"née\" Smith). The Wolseleys were an ancient landed family in Wolseley, Staffordshire, whose roots can be traced back a thousand years. Wolseley was born at Golden Bridge House, the seat of his mother's family. His paternal grandfather was Rev. William Wolseley, Rector of Tullycorbet, and the third son of Sir Richard Wolseley, 1st Baronet, who sat in the Irish House of Commons for Carlow. The family seat was Mount Wolseley in County Carlow. He had four younger sisters and two younger brothers, Frederick Wolseley (1837–1899) and Sir George Wolseley (1839–1921).\n\nWolseley's father died in 1840 at age 62, leaving his widow and seven children to struggle on his Army pension. Unlike other boys in his class, Wolseley was not sent to England to attend Harrow or Eton, but was instead educated at a local school in Dublin. The family circumstance forced Wolseley to leave school at just 14, when he found work in a surveyor's office, which helped him bring in a salary and continue studying maths and geography.\n\nWolseley first considered a career in the church, but his financial situation meant that he would have needed a wealthy patron to support such an endeavor. Instead he sought a commission in the Army. Unable to afford Sandhurst or buying a commission, Wolseley wrote to the Duke of Wellington for assistance. Wellington, then the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, promised to assist him when he turned 16. However, Wellington apparently overlooked him and did not respond to another letter sent when he was 17. Wolseley unsuccessfully appealed to his secretary, Lord Raglan. The British Army was then recovering from significant casualties in the latest war in South Africa, and Wolseley wrote Raglan, \"I shall be prepared to start at the shortest notice, should your Lordship be pleased to appoint me to a regiment now at the seat of war.\" His mother then wrote the Duke again to appeal his case, and on 12 March 1852, the 18-year-old Wolseley was gazetted as an ensign in the 12th Foot, in recognition of his father's service.\n\nJust a month after he joined the 12th Foot, Wolseley transferred to the 80th Foot on 13 April 1852, with whom he served in the Second Anglo-Burmese War. He was severely wounded when he was shot in the left thigh with a jingal bullet on 19 March 1853 in the attack on Donabyu, and was mentioned in despatches. Promoted to lieutenant on 16 May 1853 and invalided home, Wolseley transferred to the 84th Regiment of Foot on 27 January 1854, and then to the 90th Light Infantry, at that time stationed in Dublin, on 24 February 1854. He was promoted to captain on 29 December 1854.\n\nWolseley accompanied the regiment to the Crimea, and landed at Balaklava in December 1854. He was selected to be an assistant engineer, and attached to the Royal Engineers during the Siege of Sevastopol. Wolseley served throughout the siege, where he was wounded at \"the Quarries\" on 7 June 1855, and again in the trenches on 30 August 1855, losing an eye.\n\nAfter the fall of Sevastopol, Wolseley was employed on the quartermaster-general's staff, assisting in the embarkation of the troops and supplies, and was one of the last British soldiers to leave the Crimea in July 1856. For his services he was twice mentioned in despatches, received the war medal with clasp, the 5th class of the French \"Légion d'honneur\" and the 5th class of the Turkish Order of the Medjidie.\n\nSix months after joining the 90th Foot at Aldershot, he went with it in March 1857 to join the troops being despatched for the Second Opium War. Wolseley was embarked in the transport \"Transit\", which wrecked in the Strait of Banka. The troops were all saved, but with only their personal arms and minimal ammunition. They were taken to Singapore, and from there dispatched to Calcutta on account of the Indian Mutiny.\n\nWolseley distinguished himself at the relief of Lucknow under Sir Colin Campbell in November 1857, and in the defence of the Alambagh position under Outram, taking part in the actions of 22 December 1857, of 12 January 1858 and 16 January 1858, and also in the repulse of the grand attack of 21 February 1858. That March, he served at the final siege and capture of Lucknow. He was then appointed deputy-assistant quartermaster-general on the staff of Sir Hope Grant's Oudh division, and was engaged in all of the operations of the campaign, including the actions of Bari, Sarsi, Nawabganj, the capture of Faizabad, the passage of the Gumti and the action of Sultanpur. In the autumn and winter of 1858–59 he took part in the Baiswara, trans-Gogra and trans-Rapti campaigns ending with the complete suppression of the rebellion. For his services he was frequently mentioned in dispatches, and having received the Mutiny medal and clasp, he was promoted to brevet major on 24 March 1858 and to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 26 April 1859.\n\nWolseley continued to serve on Sir Hope Grant's staff in Oudh, and when Grant was nominated to the command of the British troops in the Anglo-French expedition to China of 1860, accompanied him as the deputy-assistant quartermaster-general. He was present at the action at Sin-ho, the capture of Tang-ku, the storming of the Taku Forts, the Occupation of Tientsin, the Battle of Pa-to-cheau and the entry into Peking (during which the destruction of the Chinese Imperial Old Summer Palace was begun). He assisted in the re-embarkation of the troops before the winter set in. He was Mentioned, yet again, in Dispatches, and for his services received the medal and two clasps. On his return home he published the \"Narrative of the War with China\" in 1860. He was given the substantive rank of major on 15 February 1861.\n\nIn November 1861, Wolseley was one of the special service officers sent to Canada in connection with the \"Trent\" incident.\n\nIn 1862, shortly after the Battle of Antietam, Wolseley took leave from his military duties and went to investigate the American Civil War. He befriended Southern sympathizers in Maryland, who found him passage into Virginia with a blockade runner across the Potomac River. There he met with the Generals Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson. He also provided an analysis on Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The \"New Orleans Picayune\" (10 April 1892) published Wolseley's ten-page portrayal of Forrest, which condensed much of what was written about him by biographers of the time. This work appeared in the \"Journal of the Southern Historical Society\" in the same year, and is commonly cited today. Wolseley addressed Forrest's role at the Battle of Fort Pillow near Memphis, Tennessee in April, 1864 in which black USCT troops and white officers were alleged by some to have been slaughtered after Fort Pillow had been conquered. Wolseley wrote, \"I do not think that the fact that one-half of the small garrison of a place taken by assault was either killed or wounded evinced any very unusual bloodthirstiness on the part of the assailants.\"\n\nWolseley returned to Canada where he became a brevet colonel on 5 June 1865 and Assistant Quartermaster-General in Canada with effect from the same date. He was actively employed the following year in the defence of Canada from Fenian raids launched from the United States. He was appointed Deputy Quartermaster-General in Canada on 1 October 1867. In 1869 his \"Soldiers' Pocket Book for Field Service\" was published, and has since run through many editions. In 1870, he successfully commanded the Red River Expedition to establish Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Territories and Manitoba. Manitoba had entered Canadian Confederation when the Hudson's Bay Company transferred its control of western Canada to the government of the Dominion of Canada. British and Canadian authorities ignored the pre-existing Government of Assiniboia and botched negotiations with its replacement, the \"Métis\"'s rebel Provisional Government headed by Louis Riel. The campaign to put down the rebellion was made difficult by the poor communications at the time. Fort Garry (now Winnipeg), the capital of Manitoba was a small centre separated from Ontario by the rocks and forests of the Canadian Shield region. The easiest route to Fort Garry that did not pass through the United States was through a network of rivers and lakes extending for six-hundred miles from Lake Superior, infrequently traversed by non-aboriginals, and where no supplies were obtainable. The admirable arrangements made and the careful organization of the transport reflected great credit to the commander (Wolseley), who upon his return home was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 22 December 1870, and a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 13 March 1871. Appointed assistant adjutant-general at the War Office in 1871 he furthered the Cardwell schemes of army reform.\n\nIn 1873, Wolseley commanded the expedition to the Ashanti, and, having made all his arrangements at the Gold Coast before the arrival of the troops in January 1874, was able to complete the campaign in two months, and re-embark them for home before the unhealthy season began. This campaign made him a household name in Britain. At the Battle of Amoaful on 31 January of that year Wolseley's expedition faced the numerically superior Chief Amankwatia's army in a four-hour battle. They advanced through thick bush in loose squares, and after five days' fighting, ending with the Battle of Ordashu, entered the capital Kumasi, which he burned. He received the thanks of both houses of Parliament and a grant of £25,000, was promoted to brevet major-general for distinguished service in the field on 1 April 1874, received the medal and clasp and was made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 31 March 1874, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. The freedom of the city of London was conferred upon him with a sword of honour, and he was made honorary DCL of Oxford and LL.D of Cambridge universities. On his return home he was appointed inspector-general of auxiliary forces with effect from 1 April 1874; however, in consequence of the indigenous unrest in Natal, he was sent to that colony as governor and general-commanding on 24 February 1875.\n\nWolseley accepted a seat on the Council of India in November 1876 and was promoted to the substantive rank of major-general on 1 October 1877. Having been promoted to brevet lieutenant-general on 25 March 1878, he went as high-commissioner to the newly acquired possession of Cyprus on 12 July 1878, and in the following year to South Africa to supersede Lord Chelmsford in command of the forces in the Zulu War, and as governor of Natal and the Transvaal and the High Commissioner of Southern Africa. Wolseley with his 'Ashanti Ring' of adherents was sent to Durban. But on arrival in July, he found that the war in Zululand was practically over, and, after effecting a temporary settlement, he went on to the Transvaal. He was promoted to brevet general while serving in South Africa on 4 June 1879. Having reorganized the administration there and reduced the powerful King, Sekhukhune, to submission, he returned to London in May 1880. For his services in South Africa he was awarded the South Africa Medal with clasp, and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 19 June 1880. Finally as if to signify a meteoric rise in Imperial esteem he was appointed Quartermaster-General to the Forces on 1 July 1880.\n\nOn 1 April 1882, Wolseley was appointed Adjutant-General to the Forces, and, in August of that year, given command of the British forces in Egypt under Khedive Tewfik to suppress the Urabi Revolt. Having seized the Suez Canal, he then disembarked his troops at Ismailia and, after a very short campaign, completely defeated Urabi Pasha at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, thereby suppressing yet another rebellion. For his services, he was promoted to the substantive rank of general on 18 November and raised to the peerage as Baron Wolseley, of Cairo and of Wolseley in the County of Stafford. He also received the thanks of Parliament and the Egypt Medal with clasp; the Order of Osmanieh, First Class, as bestowed by the Khedive; and the more dubious accolade of a composition in his honour by poetaster William Topaz McGonagall.\n\nOn 1 September 1884, Wolseley was again called away from his duties as adjutant-general, to command the Nile Expedition for the relief of General Gordon and the besieged garrison at Khartoum. Wolseley's unusual strategy was to take an expedition by boat up the Nile and then to cross the desert to Khartoum, while the naval boats went on to Khartoum. The expedition arrived too late; Khartoum had been taken, and Gordon was dead. In the spring of 1885, complications with Imperial Russia over the Panjdeh Incident occurred, and the withdrawal of that particular expedition followed. For his services there, he received two clasps to his Egyptian medal, the thanks of Parliament, and on 28 September 1885 was created Viscount Wolseley, of Wolseley in the County of Stafford, and a Knight of the Order of St Patrick. At the invitation of the Queen, the Wolseley family moved from their former home at 6 Hill Street, London to the much grander Ranger's House in Greenwich in autumn 1888.\n\nWolseley continued at the War Office as Adjutant-General to the Forces until 1890, when he became Commander-in-Chief, Ireland. He was promoted to be a field marshal on 26 May 1894, and appointed by the Conservative government to succeed the Duke of Cambridge as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces on 1 November 1895. This was the position to which his great experience in the field and his previous signal success at the War Office itself had fully entitled him, but it was increasingly irrelevant. Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley's powers in that office were, however, limited by a new Order in Council, and after holding the appointment for over five years, he handed over the command-in-chief to his fellow field marshal, Earl Roberts, on 3 January 1901. He had also suffered from a serious illness in 1897, from which he never fully recovered.\n\nThe unexpectedly large force required for the initial phase of the Second Boer War, was mainly furnished by means of the system of reserves Wolseley had originated—but the new conditions at the War Office were not to his liking. The fiasco now called Black Week culminated in his dismissal over Christmastide 1900. Upon being released from responsibilities he brought the whole subject before the House of Lords in a speech.\n\nLord Wolseley was Gold Stick in Waiting to Queen Victoria and took part in the funeral procession following the death of Queen Victoria in February 1901. He also served as Gold Stick in Waiting to King Edward during his coronation in August 1902.\n\nIn early 1901, Lord Wolseley was appointed by King Edward to lead a special diplomatic mission to announce the King's accession to the governments of Austria-Hungary, Romania, Serbia, the Ottoman Empire and Greece. During his visit to Constantinople, the Sultan presented him with the Order of Osmanieh set in brilliants.\n\nHe was among the original recipients of the Order of Merit in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and received the order from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. For his service with the Volunteer Force, he was awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration on 11 August 1903. He was also honorary colonel of the 23rd Middlesex Regiment from 12 May 1883, honorary colonel of the Queen's Rifle Volunteer Brigade, the Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment) from 24 April 1889, colonel of the Royal Horse Guards from 29 March 1895 and colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment from 20 July 1898.\n\nIn retirement, he was a member of the council of the Union-Castle Steamship Company.\n\nWolseley was deeply opposed to Sir Edward Watkin's attempt to build a Channel Tunnel. He gave evidence to a parliamentary commission that the construction might be \"calamitous for England\", he added that \"No matter what fortifications and defences were built, there would always be the peril of some continental army seizing the tunnel exit by surprise.\" Various contrivances to satisfy his objections were put forward including looping the line on a viaduct from the Cliffs of Dover and back into them, so that the connection could be bombarded at will by the Royal Navy. For a combination of reasons over 100 years were to pass before a permanent link was made.\n\nWolseley was married in 1867 to Louisa (1843–1920), the daughter of Mr. A. Erskine. His only child, Frances (1872–1936) was an author and founded the College for Lady Gardeners at Glynde. She was heiress to the viscountcy under special remainder, but it became extinct after her death.\n\nIn his later years, Lord and Lady Wolseley lived in a grace-and-favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace. He and his wife were wintering at Villa Tourrette, Menton on the French Riviera, where he fell ill with influenza and died on 26 March 1913.\n\nHe was buried on 31 March 1913 in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, to music played by the band of the 2nd Battalion Royal Irish Regiment, of which he was the first Colonel-in-Chief.\n\nThere is an equestrian statue of Wolseley in Horse Guards Parade in London. This was sculpted by Sir William Goscombe John R.A. and erected in 1920.\nWolseley Barracks, at London, Ontario, is a Canadian military base (now officially known as ASU London), established in 1886. It is on the site of \"Wolseley Hall\", the first building constructed by a Canadian Government specifically to house an element of the newly created Permanent Force. \"Wolseley Barracks\" has been continuously occupied by the Canadian Army since its creation, and has always housed some element of \"The Royal Canadian Regiment\". At present, Wolseley Hall is occupied by the Royal Canadian Regiment Museum and \"the Regiment's\" 4th Battalion, among other tenants. The white pith helmet still worn as part of the full-dress uniform of the RCR (pictured in the caricature above from \"Punch\") is known as a Wolseley helmet. Wolseley is also a Senior Boys house at the Duke of York's Royal Military School.\nField Marshal Lord Wolseley is commemorated by a tablet at St Michael and All Angels Church in Colwich, Staffordshire, a short distance from Shugborough Hall and Wolseley Park at Colwich, near Rugeley. The church was the burial place of the Wolseley baronets of Wolseley Park, the ancestral home of the Wolseley family.\n\nW. S. Gilbert, of the musical partnership Gilbert and Sullivan, deliberately modelled the character of Major-General Stanley in the operetta \"The Pirates of Penzance\" on Wolseley, as did George Grossmith, the actor who first created the role in the opening theatrical run. In another of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas, \"Patience\", Colonel Calverley praises Wolseley in the phrase: \"Skill of Sir Garnet in thrashing a cannibal\".\nThe residential areas of Wolseley in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, located in the west central part of the city and of Wolseley in Saskatchewan, Canada are named after him \nThe town of Wolseley, Western Cape, South Africa, is named after Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley. It was established on the farm Goedgevonden in 1875 and attained municipal status in 1955; prior to this it was known as Ceres Road.\n\nThe Sir Garnet pub in the centre of Norwich, overlooking the historic market place and city hall, is named after Field Marshal Lord Wolseley. The pub opened in about 1861 and adopted the name Sir Garnet Wolseley in 1874, changed after a brief closing (2011–12) to Sir Garnet.\n\nWolseley's uniforms, Field Marshal's baton and souvenirs from his various campaigns are held in the collections of the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Wolseley maintained a deep interest in notable individuals in Early Modern European history, and collected items related to many of them (for example, a box from Sir Francis Drake, a watch related to Oliver Cromwell, a funerary badge for Admiral Horatio Nelson and General James Wolfe's snuff box). These are also held in the collection.\n\nIn recognition of his success, an expression arose: \"all Sir Garnet\" meaning; that everything is in good order.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

At Pendine, Wales he won the Welsh TT in 1925 and the Welsh TT sidecar in 1927 on Brough machines.\n\nIn 1930 he was recruited by the Czech arms manufacturer Frantisek Janecek, founder of the JAWA motorcycle company. Janecek wanted to build a cheaper motor cycle than their current model. Patchett's contacts with the Villiers company enabled a new JAWA model to be designed around the Villiers 175cc two-stroke engine which proved very popular.\nOn the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Patchett returned to England and started work under the auto-engineer George Lanchester at the Sterling Armaments Company in Dagenham, Essex, helping to gear up manufacture of the Lanchester sub-machine gun. On his way out of Prague he managed to throw prototype samples of Janeček's new anti-tank device over the wall of the British Embassy.\n\nBy 1942, he was leading a design team to design a new sub-machine gun to the army's specification which was referred to as the \"Patchett Machine Carbine\". After successfully taking part in extensive army trials in the late 1940s it was adopted by the British Army to replace the Sten gun and known by them as the 9mm Sterling sub-machine gun L2A1. A modified version, the L2A3, was the very popular Sterling Mk IV which saw service until the 1990s.\n\nIn 1966, the British High Court awarded Patchett £116,975 (£ as of 2018) for the British government's use of the machine gun he patented. The same amount was awarded to Sterling, which had sued for half a million pounds. Mr. Justice Lloyd-Jacob referred to Patchett as \"a distinguished inventor and valued designer\" in making the award.\n"}

He was unmourned in Ireland, where he had a reputation as one of the worst and most repressive absentee landlords in the country. His estate in Portumna, County Galway, comprising , yielded 25,000 sterling yearly in rents paid by 1,900 tenants, and was a main target during the 1887 Plan of Campaign fought for fair rents by the Irish Parliamentary Party. \n\nClanricarde's opposition was so obdurate that a minister commented: \"... what right has Clanricarde to be treated better than a lunatic or an orphan?\" The estate papers contain letters from the Earl which provide ample evidence of his heartless attitude. His land agent John Blake was murdered in 1882. In 1888 the Earl wrote to Chief Secretary Balfour \"the western Irish cannot be kept up to their contracts without the threat of eviction.\" \n\nUpon the suggestion of Arthur Balfour, the Irish members of parliament submitted a bill to parliament for expropriation of his estates. The Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman expressed his approval of the bill and denounced Clanricarde in parliament in language described as 'scathing'. Never had Clanicarde visited his estates, despite the many thousands of families that had been evicted from them during that time, resulting in mass destitution. \"So universal is the execration in which this particular nobleman is held by people of every political party that when the question of this bill was put to the vote by the speaker, liberals, liberal unionists and conservatives all voted with the Irish party, only three of the nearly 700 members of the house of Commons opposing the vote, which would otherwise have been unanimous.\"\n\nFrom 1891 onwards the Congested Districts Board attempted to compulsorily purchase the estate but were not successful until 1915.

{"id": "25795594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25795594", "title": "Inuit women", "text": "Inuit women\n\nThe Inuit are the most widespread and perhaps the best known aboriginal people on earth. As a very large indigenous group inhabiting the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia, the Inuit exhibit many variations in cultural practices and customs.\n\nIn Inuit communities, the women play a crucial role in the survival of the group. The responsibilities faced by Inuit women were considered equally as important as those faced by the men. Because of this, the women were given due respect, but are not given an equal share of influence or power.\n\nRecent modernization and urbanization has transformed traditional Inuit culture and influenced the role of women within the culture. These changes include both positive and negative impacts on the overall well-being of Inuit women.\n\nIn Inuit culture, marriage was not a choice, but a necessity. Inuit men and women needed each other to survive. Married couples had to work together to overcome nearly impossible living conditions. Because every individual had to rely on a partner to survive, marriages were often arranged at birth to ensure the survival of the family. Love marriages, or choice marriages, existed, but these were all but arranged because there were usually few eligible partners. A young woman was eligible for marriage after puberty, but a man had to prove he was efficient enough in hunting to support a family before he could marry.\n\nInuit marriages rarely included large ceremonies; couples were often considered married after the birth of their first child. There were monogamous and polygamous marriages, but polygyny was rare because few men could afford to support multiple wives. Families exchanged gifts before marriages, but no official bride price or dowry was paid. Although men were considered the head of the family, both genders could demand a divorce. However, divorce was frowned upon because it was bad for the family and the community as a whole.\n\nSpouses were sometimes traded or exchanged, and women had some say in this process. This was a common alternative to divorce because neither family would be without a component vital to its survival — a mother and a wife. In Inuit culture, the family was typically represented by a \"kudlik\" (lamp) or a hearth, which was the property and responsibility of the wife. This lamp had significant symbolic meaning in the family, the community, and the culture.\n\nHunting and fishing were the primary sources of food for the Inuit people, and men were traditionally responsible for these duties. Women's duties included gathering other sources of food, such as eggs and berries, and preparing the food the hunters brought back. Seals, walrus, whales and caribou were the most common targets of Inuit hunters. Animals killed by the hunters needed to be butchered and frozen quickly, before they went bad or froze before being butchered. Women were traditionally responsible for the butchering, skinning, and cooking of animals taken by the hunters.\n\nIn Inuit culture, it was believed that the women's respect for the animals killed during hunting trips, and subsequent care when butchering them, would ensure successful hunts. Food, as well as other resources, were often shared throughout the community as needed. Women were in charge of the distribution of food to families in the community.\n\nThe Inuit moved with the seasons to maximize their chances of a successful hunt; their entire families often moved with them. Because of this, tools and other items used by the Inuit for hunting and food preparation had to be light and easily transported. Among some Inuit groups this led to the development of complex tools such as light and powerful metal harpoons and wood stoves, which were being used by the late 1800s.\n\nChildbirth and childcare were two of the most important responsibilities for an Inuit woman. Inuit parents showed a very high level of warmth and affection to their children. Inuit children usually began to contribute to the family and community by the age of 12 through activities like picking berries and hunting small game. During this period, they learned skills from their parents through close observation. Learning through observation was the chosen method because it was not practical for children to practice their skills by sewing valuable skins or accompanying men on important hunting trips.\n\nWomen raised boys and girls. Men taught boys certain skills, such as hunting, and women taught girls certain skills, such as sewing. Children were named after family members, often ones who recently died. There were no boys and girls names in Inuit culture, so it was common for a girl to have the name of her grandfather, for example.\n\nChildren were taught at a young age to listen to their parents and respect their elders, and were treated with more autonomy than non-Inuit children. Over disciplining a child was seen as counter productive so children were rarely punished for transgressions. Learning was regarded as a partnership between child and adult, with children being more guided through life than directly taught or lectured.\n\nAdoption was very common in Inuit culture, and it was often very informal. Unwanted babies, or babies a family could not support, could be offered to another family. If the other family accepted, the adoption was complete.\n\nInfanticide was common when conditions were desperate and the group was threatened by starvation. A mother abandoned an infant in hopes that someone less desperate might find and adopt the child before the cold or animals killed it. The belief that the Inuit regularly resorted to infanticide may be due in part to studies done by Asen Balikci, Milton Freeman, and David Riches among the Netsilik, along with the trial of Kikkik. Children who could not be supported by a community due to a lack of resources were often killed as infants. This was seen as best for the culture and prevented the suffering of other family members.\n\nAlong with childbirth and childcare, women were responsible for sewing skins to make clothes; preserving, processing, and cooking food (as mentioned above); caring for the sick and elderly; and helping to build and take care of the family's shelter. Warm, light, and serviceable clothing was perhaps the greatest achievement of the Inuit. For protection against the bitter Arctic winter, it has not been surpassed by even the best modern clothing.\n\nThe clothing created by women was vital because life in Arctic conditions was not possible without extremely well-made clothing to protect from the bitter cold. The clothing was created by the careful sewing of animal skins and furs using ivory needles, which were highly valuable in Inuit society. The process of preparing skins to be sewn together for creating clothes was done by women and was an arduous task. Skins had to be scraped, stretched, and softened before they were ready to be sewn.\n\nIn addition to this, the households Inuit women were expected to help construct and care for could range from igloos, to semi-subterranean sod houses, to tents in the summer months. This required an understanding of complex architectural concepts, as well as the principles of insulation. A good amount of strength was required to construct Inuit shelters. Because of this, Inuit women often worked together and enlisted the help of men to build their homes. For both practical and social purposes, these houses would be built close together or were made large enough for more than one family to live in.\n\nJobs in Inuit culture were not considered men's work or women's work, but the Inuit did believe in men's skills and women's skills. For example, hunting was generally done by the men. Sewing clothes, cooking and preparing food, gathering food outside of hunting, and caring for the home were generally done by women. This does not mean that women never hunted, nor that men never helped with other jobs. This was just how the work was traditionally divided.\n\nWomen hunted and boated for enjoyment or when food was scarce and the community needed extra hunters. Men and women worked together to create a functioning culture. The men would not be able to go hunting without the warm clothes the women sewed for them, and the women would not have enough food without the meat the men brought back from their hunting trips.\n\nBecause of this, the work done by women received equal respect to the work done by men. While men and women generally did different work, one type of work was not considered better or more important than other types. It is easy to think that because men only had one job that they did less work. The truth is that hunting was extremely physically demanding and time consuming, and often required traveling for days or weeks at a time. As a result, the sexual division of labour in Inuit culture was relatively equal in the amount of work done.\n\nWhile women were respected by men, and often treated as equals, they did not have equal power in the community. Important decisions, such as when to migrate and where to, could be made exclusively by men. Inuit people had as little government as any group on earth, but some groups did have tribal councils or groups of elders who made decisions for the community. These councils were almost exclusively male.\n\nBecause of this, the Inuit women had little to no say in some of their communities' most important decisions. Men usually had the final say in issues such as arranging marriages and adoption or infanticide, which have a huge impact on women's lives. Although women had a relatively high position socially, and had significant control of their own home, as well as ceremonially important jobs such as lighting and tending to lamps and distributing food, their power was usually limited to those areas.\n\nIn addition to this, if men were unhappy with how a woman was handling her responsibilities, they could take over or transfer her work to another woman in the community whom they considered more capable. With women having less power, they are often put in difficult positions when they are not involved in the decision-making process. For example, a pregnant woman, or a woman with a newborn child, may not be able to migrate hundreds of miles through Arctic conditions in search of better hunting grounds. Factors such as these are rarely taken into account when men are the sole decision-makers for a community.\n\nAfter contact with other cultures, the Inuit were introduced to new technologies and modernization, which changed their lives drastically. The Inuit are now a modern people and, like almost all indigenous peoples, no longer live the way their ancestors did. This is especially true of Inuit women.\n\nAfter modernization, the Inuit began to move into Arctic towns and participate in wage labor, government employment, community councils, and the acquisition of modern clothing, housing, and vehicles. Male Inuit initially took the lead in assimilation by learning the language of the arriving culture and taking on modern, wage earning jobs; however, a lack of education began to hinder the men's ability to find and keep jobs.\n\nAs a result of this, women began to lead the way in cultural assimilation. Women started by finding work as domestic servants, store clerks, hospital aides, classroom assistants, interpreters, and in weaving and knitting shops. Inuit women tend to go to school more than Inuit men, and this is especially true of college. Some universities in regions where the Inuit are prominent, such as the Nunavut Arctic College, have programs designed specifically for the Inuit people. Women, much more often than men, take advantage of these programs.\n\nBecause Inuit women seek more education and, subsequently, better jobs, they have increasingly taken on the role as primary wage earner for the family. This has caused men to assume responsibilities in the house that were traditionally done by the women, such as raising children and keeping the home in order.\n\nThe \"role reversal\" that has begun to occur in Inuit society has given women a major increase in power and influence. Women have begun to seek more power for themselves, both in decision-making in the family and the culture as a whole. As the primary wage earners, working women are now considered the heads of their families and have the upper hand in making decisions for them. This has complicated the relationship between Inuit men and women. Men have begun to resent women for \"stealing their rightful place as the head of the family\" and may turn to drinking and/or drug abuse to deal with these issues. However, this is not the only reason for men and women to start drinking/gambling/drugs, as you must remember that there has been extensive trauma endured from the 1960s scoop, and Residential schools. It can't all be blamed on woman taking power in a family system. There's lots of support for women to get employed from their family.\n\nReactions such as these perpetuate the cycle (and misinformation like this perpetuates the cycle), as men are less likely to be employed after exhibiting these behaviors. Another change that has begun is that Inuit women have increasingly started to run for political office. Although the positions they seek are often at the community and local levels, this increase in activism reflects the new confidence Inuit women have found in the modern world.\n\nThe second premier of Nunavut was a woman, Eva Aariak, who was one of two female MLAs in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. The current mayor of Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, is a woman, Elisapee Sheutiapik, as is the Member of Parliament for Nunavut, Leona Aglukkaq, who is also the Canadian Minister of Health.\n\nScientists have found that the Inuit people seem to experience more illness and health issues than other groups, especially the women and children, and especially in the post-modernization period. A possible explanation is that the Inuit diet was traditionally high in fat and protein and low in fruits and vegetables.\n\nMore likely explanations include a change in diet after modernization, a decrease in physical activity as traditional jobs such as hunting and constructing homes are practiced less and less, or exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Whatever the cause, diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol are serious problems for the Inuit people. Even more troubling, studies have shown that these issues are worse for women than other groups.\n\nAnother major issue facing the Inuit is that, after modernization, suicide, violence, depression, and substance abuse have become increasingly prevalent. This may be the result of psychological issues stemming from not having a place in society or being torn between modern life and the culture of their ancestors. Sadly, suicide, depression, and substance abuse are increasingly becoming associated with Inuit women.\n\nThe pressure for Inuit women to conform to the dress and behavior of modern Western culture is immense; however, many aspects of modern culture are foreign to the Inuit women and are directly at odds with the traditional practices of their culture. Contemporary Inuit women are trapped between cultures, and the results are devastating to their physical and psychological health.\n\n\n"}

He subsequently met with President Barack Obama, received a Best Moment ESPY Award for 2013, and the United States Senate approved a motion recognizing his role in raising awareness of pediatric brain cancer. The Team Jack Foundation was formed by his parents, Andy and Bri Hoffman, to raise money for pediatric brain research.\n\nHoffman was born and is growing up in Atkinson, Nebraska. His parents are Andy and Bri Hoffman and he has two sisters, Ava and Reese.\n\nOn April 22, 2011 Hoffman was having breakfast with his parents when he became unresponsive. He was rushed to the local hospital in Atkinson, Nebraska, where he had a grand mal seizure lasting 30 minutes.\nHe was then flown to Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, due to the life-threatening seizure. \nHe was subsequently diagnosed with a brain tumor. While at the hospital, Hoffman continued to have up to 10 to 12 seizures per day even though he was taking anticonvulsant medication. On May 20, 2011 he had surgery, but the neurosurgeon could only remove a small portion of the tumor. Subsequent pathology showed that it was a cancerous glioma, pediatric brain cancer. Hoffman's parents then consulted Boston Children's Hospital for a second opinion. Neurosurgeon Liliana Goumnerova told the Hoffmans that she could remove the golf-ball sized tumor.\n\nOn October 10, 2011, Hoffman had a second surgery. Over 90% of the tumor was removed and the seizures stopped.\nSurgery was followed by another 60 weeks of chemotherapy.\nIn October 2013, Hoffman's father reported that an MRI revealed that the remaining tumor was the same as in an MRI done in June, 2013, indicating that the cancerous tumor was not growing.\nAs of April 2014, his cancer was still in remission.\n\nDuring the time between Hoffman's first and second surgeries, his father called Keith Zimmer who was the associate director of Life Skills at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Athletic Department. He wanted to get a picture of his son with his favorite Nebraska football player, Rex Burkhead. Burkhead agreed and met the family in September 2011. He had lunch with the Hoffman family, showed them Memorial Stadium, and decided he wanted to keep in touch with Hoffman. On Friday, October 7, 2011, Burkead called Hoffman before his second surgery to wish him well. The next day Nebraska played Ohio State in a game nationally televised by ABC, and ABC announcers mentioned Hoffman's story. At halftime of the game, Nebraska trailed Ohio State 20-6. At that time Burkhead thought about Hoffman and he said to his teammates \"Jack's not giving up and we're not giving up.\" Nebraska ended up winning the game, 34-27, which was the largest comeback in Nebraska football history.\n\nIn September 2012, Hoffman walked with the Nebraska players on to the field for their game against Wisconsin. In April 2013, as the spring football game neared, Jeff Jamrog (Assistant Athletic Director for Football) had the idea of getting Hoffman into the spring game. He ran the idea by football coach Bo Pelini the night before the game and Pelini approved. Jamrog told the Hoffmans about their plan to get Jack into the game that night and the Hoffmans quickly made a uniform for him to wear the next day.\n\nDuring the game, the Hoffmans were on the sidelines with the team. As the fourth quarter began, the Red team had fourth down and one yard to go on their own 32 yard line. Pelini called timeout and sent Hoffman into the game wearing number 22 (Rex Burkhead's number). As the play began, Nebraska quarterback Taylor Martinez initially guided Hoffman in the right direction and then he ran for a touchdown. When he reached the end zone, the players lifted him onto their shoulders in front of 60,174 people at Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe story leading up to the touchdown run and the video of the run were covered extensively nationally and internationally.\nBy April 16, 2013, a YouTube video of the touchdown run had been viewed over seven million times.\n\nAfter Rex Burkhead met Hoffman, a bond began to grow between him and the Nebraska football team. The players decided to start an initiative to raise money for cancer research they called \"Team Jack.\" Team Jack sold 30,000 T-shirts and collected $275,000 in donations, which they gave to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. The Hoffman family subsequently established the Team Jack Foundation, which has raised almost $1.5 million for pediatric brain cancer research.\n\nOn April 29, 2013, the Hoffman family and Rex Burkhead met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office for 15 minutes. Obama told Hoffman that he was proud of him and gave him a football. When asked about his meeting with the president, Hoffman replied \"I thought it was awesome.\"\n\nIn May, 2013, Upper Deck Company made a \"Star Rookie\" trading card for Hoffman. Upper Deck's sports marketing manager explained why they created the trading card: \"Jack is the type of inspirational athlete who absolutely deserves an Upper Deck rookie card.\" The sale of the cards has brought in $50,000 for the Team Jack Foundation. After attending the May 16, 2014, 19th Annual Dick Vitale Gala, where Hoffman signed a trading card for Dick Vitale, the \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\" wrote: \"Yes, he may be an 8-year-old celebrity, but really, he’d much rather be a regular kid.\"\n\nHoffman won an ESPY Award for Best Moment ESPY Award in 2013.\nHoffman's touchdown run was listed fifth in The Best Emotional Moment in sports for 2013 by \"USA Today\".\nHoffman was also one of five nominees for Sportsman of the Year by \"Sports Illustrated\" in 2013.\n\nSenator Deb Fischer offered a resolution to the Senate that states that pediatric brain cancer is a leading cause of death. The resolution also singles out Hoffman's touchdown run for increasing awareness of pediatric brain cancer:\nOn August 5, 2014, Hoffman found out that his tumor had grown since his April, 2014 MRI. His father reported that in April, there was a spot in his scan, but that they had hoped that it was nothing. Hoffman will likely undergo further chemotherapy or surgery. After consultation with Hoffman's medical team, in mid-August 2014, his parents decided to pursue a clinical trial in Boston involving a genetic therapy approach in part because the cancer has spread to the brain stem making surgery difficult.\n\n"}

{"id": "4683531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4683531", "title": "Jon Sobrino", "text": "Jon Sobrino\n\nJon Sobrino (born 1938) is a Jesuit Catholic priest and theologian, known mostly for his contributions to liberation theology. He received worldwide attention in 2007 when the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a notification for what they termed doctrines that are \"erroneous or dangerous and may cause harm to the faithful.\"\n\nBorn 27 December 1938 into a Basque family in Barcelona, Sobrino entered the Society of Jesus when he was 18. The following year, in 1958, he was sent to El Salvador. He later studied engineering at Saint Louis University, an American Jesuit university, and then theology at Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt in West Germany for his Doctor of Theology (Dr.theol.) degree. Returning to El Salvador, he taught at the Jesuit-run University of Central America (UCA) in San Salvador, which he helped to found.\n\nOn 16 November 1989 he narrowly escaped the murder of the UCA scholars by the Atlacatl Battalion, an elite unit of the Salvadoran Army. By a coincidence, he was away from El Salvador when members of the military broke into the rectory at the UCA and brutally murdered his six fellow Jesuits, Ignacio Ellacuría, Segundo Montes, Juan Ramón Moreno, Ignacio Martín-Baró, Amando López, and Joaquín López y López, and their housekeeper Elba Ramos and her 16-year-old daughter Celina Ramos. The Jesuits were targeted for their outspoken work to bring a resolution to the brutal El Salvador Civil War that left about 75,000 men, women, and children dead, mostly civilians.\n\nInvestigated by the Vatican throughout his career as a professor of theology, he has remained an outspoken proponent of peace, joining protests in 2008 of the continued training of Latin American military officers in torture techniques at the School of the Americas at Fort Benning.\n\nSobrino's main works are \"Jesus the Liberator\" (1991) and its sequel \"Christ the Liberator\" (1999), along with \"Christology at the Crossroads\" (1978), \"The True Church and the Poor\" (1984), \"Spirituality of Liberation\" (1990), \"The Principle of Mercy: Taking the Crucified People from the Cross\" (Orbis, 1994), \"No Salvation Outside the Poor\", and \"Prophetic-Utopian Essays\" (Orbis, 2008).\n\nBecause of the theological positions he took in his works, Sobrino was the subject of a theological notification; a critique statement and an admonishment by the Vatican and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in March 2007.\n\nThe congregation declared that Sobrino placed too great an emphasis on the human nature of Jesus Christ, downplaying Jesus' divine nature, and that his \"works contain propositions which are either erroneous or dangerous and may cause harm to the faithful.\"\n\nWhile certain of his teachings were declared false, the congregation did not condemn or censure him, or prohibit him from teaching or lecturing. However, Federico Lombardi at the Vatican Press Office hinted at the possibility that his bishop or superior in the Jesuit order might choose to take action.\n\nThe congregation emphasized in the notification that it was issued as part of its service \"to the people of God, and particularly to the simple and poorest members of the Church.\" They emphasized the people's \"right to know the truth ... about Christ\" and therefore their corresponding duty to intervene. The notification was premised on Benedict XVI's teaching that \"the first poverty among people is not to know Christ.\"\n\nAccording to the Notification, Sobrino's erroneous propositions concerned: \"1) the methodological presuppositions on which the Author bases his theological reflection, 2) the Divinity of Jesus Christ, 3) the Incarnation of the Son of God, 4) the relationship between Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God, 5) the Self-consciousness of Jesus, and 6) the salvific value of his Death.\"\n\nAt the root of what the Vatican saw as Sobrino's error is his affirmation that \"the 'Church of the poor' is the ecclesial 'setting' of Christology and offers it its fundamental orientation.\" However, the Vatican believes that it is \"only the apostolic faith which the Church has transmitted through all generations that constitutes the ecclesial setting of Christology and of theology in general.\"\n\nContrary to criticisms that the Vatican acted without due consultation and unfairly, the Vatican says that a Notification is made after notifying the author of the statements that are seen to be problematic and after awaiting a reply from the author who is given 3 months whereby to respond.\n\nRetired professor of theology Peter Hünermann (then Tübingen, Germany) declared in April 2007 that the Vatican notification was a \"shock\" for all theologians, because along with Sobrino \"the most distinguished exegetes and systematic theologians – both Catholic and Protestant – stood in the dock\". Supported by more than 100 professors of Catholic theology, Hünermann also demanded an \"intelligent redevelopment\" of the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, because, as successor organization of the Holy Office, it still had the structure of an \"early modern board of censors\".\n\nSobrino's work was reviewed by a number of theologians, including , , Javier Vitoria, Carlo Palacio of Bello Horizonte, and Martin Maier, editor of the German Jesuit periodical \"Stimmen der Zeit\". These theologians found no doctrinal errors in Sobrino's works. It is not apparent that their findings have been considered by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\n"}
{"id": "369656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369656", "title": "Julia Domna", "text": "Julia Domna\n\nJulia Domna (AD 160–217) was a Roman empress of Syrian origins, the second wife of Septimius Severus (reigned 193–211). She was born in Emesa in the Roman province of Syria, into a family of priests of the deity Elagabalus. \n\nAs a powerful political figure and member of the imperial family, Julia received titles such as \"mother of the army camps\". She was famous for her political influence. \n\nAfter Severus' death in 211, his two sons with Julia, Geta and Caracalla, ruled jointly over Rome. Caracalla had Geta assassinated later that year. Julia continued to have a powerful role during the reign of Caracalla. Julia is thought to have committed suicide in 217 upon hearing of the assassination of Caracalla. After her death, her older sister Julia Maesa successfully contended for political power.\n\nJulia Domna was born in Emesa (modern day Homs) in Syria around 160 AD to a family of Arab descent. Her name, Domna, is an archaic Arabic word that means black. She was the youngest daughter of the high-priest of Ba'al Gaius Julius Bassianus and sister to Julia Maesa. Through her sister and Maesa's husband Julius Avitus, Julia Domna had two nieces: Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea, the respective mothers of future Roman emperors Elagabalus and Severus Alexander.\n\nJulia's ancestors were priest kings of the famous temple of Elagabalus. The family had enormous wealth and was promoted to Roman senatorial aristocracy. Before her marriage, Julia inherited the estate of her paternal great-uncle Julius Agrippa, a former leading centurion.\n\nIn the late 180s, Julia married the Libyan Roman general Septimius Severus. The marriage proved happy, and Severus cherished Julia and her political opinions, since she was very well-read and a student of philosophy. They had two sons, Caracalla (Lucius Septimius Bassianus) in 188 and Geta (Publius Septimius Geta) in 189.\n\nAfter the Roman emperor Commodus was murdered without an heir in 192, many contenders rushed for the throne, including Julia's husband, Septimius Severus. An elder senator, Pertinax, was appointed by the praetorian guard as the new emperor of Rome. But when Pertinax would not meet the guard's demands, he too was murdered. Another politician, Didius Julianus, was called to Rome and appointed emperor. Severus, coming from the north into Rome, overthrew Julianus and had him executed. Severus claimed the title of emperor in 193. By offering Clodius Albinus, a powerful governor of Britannia, the rank of Caesar (successor), Severus could focus on his other rival to the throne, Pescennius Niger, whom he defeated at the Battle of Issus in 194. When afterwards Severus declared openly his son Caracalla as successor, Clodius Albinus was hailed emperor by his troops. At the Battle of Lugdunum in 197, Severus defeated and killed Albinus, establishing himself as Emperor. Thus Julia Domna became Empress consort.\n\nUnlike most imperial wives, Julia remarkably accompanied her husband on his military campaigns and stayed in camp with the army. During this time, honorary titles were granted to Julia similar to those given to Faustina the Younger, including \"mater castorum\", mother of the camp, \"mater Augustus\", mother of Augustus, and \"mater patriae, mother of the fatherland.\n\nThe empress was involved in building projects, most notably the \"aedes Vestae\" after the fire of Commodus in 192 destroyed areas of the temple and the home, or Atrium, of the Vestal Virgins; based on numismatic evidence, historical authors, and a laconic inscription found \"in situ\", some scholars agree that Julia funded restorations to the site during Septimius Severus's reign.\n\nJulia was respected and viewed positively for most of her tenure, as indicators and evidence include the coins minted with her portrait, mentioning her with several honorary titles and also simply as \"Julia Augusta\". Julia is said to have exceeded all other Roman empresses in titles and honours. The hairstyle that she used would later be worn by Roman empress Cornelia Salonina and Palmyran queen Zenobia.\n\nWhen Severus died in 211 in Eboracum (York), Julia became the mediator between their two sons, Caracalla and Geta, who were supposed to rule as joint emperors, according to their father's wishes expressed in his will. The two young men were never fond of each other and quarrelled frequently. Geta was murdered by Caracalla's soldiers in the same year. Geta's name was then removed from inscriptions and his image was erased.\n\nDuring his campaign against the Parthian empire in 217, Caracalla was assassinated by a soldier. Julia chose to commit suicide after hearing about the rebellion, perhaps a decision hastened by the fact that she was suffering from breast cancer, as well as a reluctance to return to private life. Her sister Julia Maesa restored the Severan dynasty about a year after Julia Domna's death. Julia Domna's body was brought to Rome and placed in the \"Sepulcrum C. et L. Caesaris\" (perhaps a separate chamber in the Mausoleum of Augustus). Later, however, both her bones and those of Geta were transferred by Julia Maesa to the Mausoleum of Hadrian.\n\nJulia Domna is remembered for encouraging Philostratus to write \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\". Julia is thought to have died before Philostratus could finish his work of eight volumes.\n\n"}

After a spiritual experience at age 13, several years later, she began itinerant preaching, with her elder sister and brother-in law, in Idaho. Later, she was ordained by the Evangelical Church Alliance.\n\nKuhlman met Burroughs Waltrip, a Texas evangelist who was eight years her senior. Shortly after his visit to Denver, Waltrip divorced his wife, left his family and moved to Mason City, Iowa, where he began a revival center called Radio Chapel. Kuhlman and her friend and pianist Helen Gulliford came into town to help him raise funds for his ministry. It was shortly after their arrival that the romance between Burroughs and Kuhlman became publicly known.\n\nBurroughs and Kuhlman decided to wed. While discussing the matter with some friends, Kuhlman had said that she could not \"find the will of God in the matter.\" These and other friends encouraged her not to go through with the marriage, but Kuhlman justified it to herself and others by believing that Waltrip's wife had left him, not the other way around. On October 18, 1938, she secretly married \"Mister,\" as she liked to call Waltrip, in Mason City. The wedding did not give her new peace about their union, however. The couple had no children. Regarding her marriage, in a 1952 interview with the Denver Post, Kuhlman said, \"He charged—correctly—that I refused to live with him. And I haven't seen him in eight years.\" She was divorced by Burroughs Waltrip in 1948.\n\nKuhlman traveled extensively around the United States and in many other countries holding \"healing crusades\" between the 1940s and 1970s. She was one of the most well-known healing ministers in the world. Kuhlman had a weekly TV program in the 1960s and 1970s called \"I Believe In Miracles\" that was aired nationally. She also had a 30-minute nationwide radio ministry of teaching from the Bible and frequently would feature excerpts from her healing services (both music and message). Her foundation was established in 1954, and its Canadian branch in 1970. Late in her life she was supportive of the nascent Jesus movement, and received endorsements by its key leaders, including David Wilkerson and Chuck Smith. \n\nBy 1970 she moved to Los Angeles, conducting healing services for thousands of people each day as an heir to Aimee Semple McPherson. She became well known for her \"gift of healing\" despite, as she often noted, having no theological training. She was friends with Christian television pioneer Pat Robertson and made guest appearances at his Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) and on the network's flagship program \"The 700 Club.\"\n\nIn 1975, Kuhlman was sued by Paul Bartholomew, her personal administrator, who claimed that she kept $1 million in jewelry and $1 million in fine art hidden away and sued her for $430,500 for breach of contract. Two former associates accused her in the lawsuit of diverting funds and of illegally removing records, which she denied and said the records were not private. According to Kuhlman, the lawsuit was settled prior to trial.\n\nMany accounts of medically documented healings were published in her books, which were ghost-written by author Jamie Buckingham of Florida, including her autobiography, which was dictated at a hotel in Las Vegas. Buckingham also wrote his own Kuhlman biography that presented an unvarnished account of her life. An estimated two million people reported they were healed in her meetings over the years.\n\nFollowing a 1967 fellowship in Philadelphia, Dr. William A. Nolen conducted a case study of 23 people who said they had been cured during one of her services. Nolen's long term follow-ups concluded that there were no cures in those cases. One woman who was said to have been cured of spinal cancer threw away her brace and ran across the stage at Kuhlman's command; her spine collapsed the next day and she died four months later.\n\nNolen's analysis of Kulhman came in for criticism from believers. Lawrence Althouse, a physician, said that Nolen had attended only one of Kuhlman's services and did not follow up with all of those who said they had been healed there. Dr. Richard Casdorph produced a book of evidence in support of miraculous healings by Kuhlman. Hendrik van der Breggen, a Christian philosophy professor, argued in favor of the claims. Author Craig Keener concluded, \"No one claims that everyone was healed, but it is also difficult to dispute that significant recoveries occurred, apparently in conjunction with prayer. One may associate these with Kathryn Kuhlman's faith or that of the supplicants, or, as in some of Kuhlman's teaching, to no one's faith at all; but the evidence suggests that some people were healed, even in extraordinary ways.\"\n\nDr. Richard Owellen, a member of the cancer‐research department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital who appeared frequently at Miss Kuhlman's services, testified to various healings that he said he had investigated.\n\nIn 1955, in her late 40s, Kuhlman was diagnosed with a heart problem. She kept a very busy schedule, often traveling across the United States and around the world, holding two- to six-hour long meetings which ended late. In July 1975 her doctor diagnosed her with a minor heart flare-up; in November she had a relapse. As a result, Kuhlman had open-heart surgery in Tulsa, Oklahoma from which she died on February 20, 1976. Kathryn Kuhlman is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. A plaque in her honor is in the main city park in Concordia, Missouri, a town in central Missouri on Interstate Highway 70.\n\nAfter she died, her will led to controversy. She left $267,500, the bulk of her estate, to three family members and twenty employees. Smaller bequests were given to 19 other employees. According to the \"Independent Press-Telegram\", her employees were disappointed that \"she did not leave most of her estate to the foundation as she had done under a previous 1974 will.\" The Kathryn Kuhlman Foundation had continued, but due to lack of funding, in 1982 terminated its nationwide radio broadcasting. Ultimately, the Foundation shut its doors in April 2016. \n\nFor several decades there has been serious debate regarding the authenticity of Kuhlman's ministry. Some would suggest that she was a modern-day prophet exercising the power of God.\nThe debate continues today with many believers upholding Kuhlman as an important forerunner (including proponents of the \"Prosperity Theology\" and \"Faith Healing\" movement, such as Benny Hinn), and with some Christian cessationist apologists.Others argue the opposite: that is, that Kuhlman did not teach core tenents of \"word of faith\" and \"hyper-prosperity\" doctrine; for example she did not teach \"little gods\" doctrine, nor that Jesus suffered the pains of hell and thus needed to be born-again in hell. Significantly, neither did she teach that faith (on the part of the sick person) is always a prerequisite to supernatural healing, as is taught in classic \"word of faith\" doctrine.\n\nStill, she influenced faith healers Benny Hinn and Billy Burke. Hinn has adopted some of her techniques and wrote a book about her.\n\nIn 1981 David Byrne and Brian Eno sampled one of Kuhlman's sermons in their album \"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts\". The track was entitled \"The Spirit Womb,\" a mis-hearing of Kuhlman's actual utterance \"the spirit world.\" When Kuhlman's estate refused to license the use of her voice, the track was re-recorded as \"The Jezebel Spirit\" with an unidentified exorcist's vocal replacing Kuhlman's.\n\nQuestions about her were raised in the Crusaders Series of Christian Comics dealing with True Doctrine in the Church, which are published by Jack Chick.\n\nShe appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson in 1974. Also, she was mentioned on more than one occasion on the \"Mary Tyler Moore \" Show, as well as \"The Carol Burnett Show\".\n\nRuth Buzzi did a character based on Kuhlman on \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh In\".\n\n\n\n"}

After graduating from Emporia Senior High School in 1967, Essex attended Emporia State University, where he dropped out after only one semester. He joined the United States Navy as a dental technician in 1969, stationed in San Diego, California, where he claimed he was subjected to two years of ceaseless racial abuse.\n\nHe went absent without leave (AWOL) from October 19 until November 16, 1970. He was given a general discharge for unsuitability on February 10, 1971, for \"character and behavior disorders\". After his discharge, he became involved with black radicals in San Francisco, California, and later joined the New York Black Panthers.\n\nAt the age of 23 and living in New Orleans, Essex began targeting policemen. On New Year's Eve 1972, Essex parked his car and went down Perdido Street, a block from the New Orleans Police Department. He hid in a parking lot across from the busy central lockup and used a 5-shot Ruger Model 44 .44-caliber semi-automatic carbine to kill Cadet Alfred Harrell, 19. Lt. Horace Perez was also wounded in the attack. Harrell was black, although Essex had claimed he was going to kill \"just honkies\" before beginning his murderous attacks. \n\nEssex evaded being taken into custody by jumping a chain link fence and running across I-10, while setting off firecrackers as a diversion. Essex then ran into Gert Town, an area renowned for high crime and hostility towards police. In Gert Town, Essex broke into the Burkart building, a warehouse and manufacturing plant on the corner of Euphrosine and South Gayoso. Upon entering the building, an alarm alerted police to a break-in at the business. A dog unit with Officers Edwin Hosli Sr. and Harold Blappert responded to the call, not realizing the connection of the break-in to the attack on central lockup.\n\nWhen Officer Hosli went to get his German shepherd out of the back seat of the car, Essex shot him in the back. Essex then started shooting the car, shattering the windshield. Officer Blappert then crawled across the front seat to the radio and called for back-up. Blappert fired four shots at the spot where he saw muzzle flashes from Essex's rifle, then he pulled his partner's body onto the front seat of the car and waited for back-up. When the back-up arrived, they sent two dogs into the building to search for Essex, but Essex had escaped again. Officer Hosli died of his injuries on March 5, 1973.\n\nAt 10:15 a.m. on January 7, 1973, Essex shot grocer Joe Perniciaro with his .44 Magnum carbine and next carjacked Marvin Albert as he sat in his 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle outside his house on South White Street. Essex drove Albert's stolen vehicle to the Downtown Howard Johnson's Hotel at 330 Loyola Avenue in New Orleans' Central Business District, across the street from City Hall and Orleans Parish Civil District Court. After almost hitting a startled motorist in the hotel's parking garage, Essex began to climb the stairs, only to find the fire doors locked on floor after floor.\n\nGaining entry from a fire stairwell on the 18th floor, the top floor of the building, Essex startled three Howard Johnson's employees, all of whom were African-American. Essex told them not to worry, as he was only there to kill white people. The employees promptly notified the authorities. In the hallway in front of room 1829, Essex found 27-year-old vacationing Dr. Robert Steagall and his wife Betty, a couple from Virginia enjoying a belated honeymoon. After a struggle with Dr. Steagall, Essex shot him in the chest and shot Betty in the back of the head. The Steagalls both died of their injuries. In the room, he soaked telephone books with lighter fluid and set them ablaze under the curtains. Essex dropped a Pan-African flag onto the floor beside the bodies of the couple as he left. On the 11th floor, Essex shot his way into several rooms and set more fires. On the 11th floor, he shot and killed Frank Schneider, the hotel's assistant manager, and shot Walter Collins, the hotel's general manager. Collins died in the hospital three weeks later as a result of his gunshot wounds.\n\nThe police and fire department quickly arrived. Two officers tried to use a fire truck's ladder to enter the building, but were shot at by Essex. A few minutes later, Essex shot and killed NOPD Officers Phillip Coleman and Paul Persigo from his perch on the 18th floor. \"Times-Picayune\" photographer G.E. Arnold took an iconic photo as Coleman died of a head wound in Duncan Plaza. Arnold also captured a shot of a wounded Eighth District NOPD officer, Ken Solis, shot in the shoulder and leaning against a tree as another officer, Dave McCann, was trying to stop the bleeding, all while other police and bystanders take cover. While trying to rescue trapped officers, Deputy Superintendent Louis Sirgo was fatally shot in the spine by Essex. Lt. Lewis Townsend, a Tulane medical student, walked into the open field to carry Sirgo out of the line of fire, then returned to class.\n\nSeeing the story on TV, Lt. General Chuck Pitman of the United States Marine Corps offered the use of a CH-46 military helicopter to assist the police officers. The helicopter was loaded with armed men and dispatched to the hotel. By this time, Essex had retreated up to the roof of the building where he and the helicopter exchanged many rounds over many hours. As nightfall came, Essex found cover in a concrete cubicle on the southeast side of the roof. As he stepped out once again in the open to fire again on the helicopter, and after hitting the helicopter's transmission, Essex was barraged with fatal gunfire from police sharpshooters on the roofs of adjacent buildings as well as the automatic weapons aboard the helicopter. An autopsy later revealed more than 200 gunshot wounds.\n\nAfter the smoke had cleared, a tally revealed that Essex had shot 19 people, including 10 policemen. Essex is buried in Plot 47-4-1 (with a headstone) in Maplewood Memorial Lawn Cemetery, Emporia, Kansas.\n\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53852085/mark-james_robert-essex\n\n\n"}

Called the \"High Profile Cop\" of the Delhi Police, Maxwell Pereira's thirty-five year career as a police officer has been highlighted with laurels. He has nine national and four regional award adorning the lapel of his uniform, making him one of the most highly decorated police officers in India. Also a thoroughbred field officer with a reputation for taking the bull by the horns, he has received the Indian Police Medal for Gallantry (1979), the Police Medal for Meritorious Services (1987) and the President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Services (1995).\n\nMaxwell Pereira was born in Salem (under the erstwhile Madras Presidency, now Tamil Nadu), India, on 3 October 1944 - a son to Ligoury Bernard Pereira (of the Bajpe Kuntala-kambla Pereira-Kamath lineage) and Stella Eleanora D'Souza. He received his early education at Mangalore's St. Aloysius School before taking his Bachelor of Science (St. Joseph's graduating class of 1965) and Bachelor of Laws (Govt. Law College - graduating class of 1967) degrees from Bangalore University. Further study led to a Diploma in Business Administration from New Delhi in 1975.\n\nPereira-Kamath began his government service in the year 1970. Prior to this, he managed his father's Coffee Estates in Sakleshpur and was an Advocate in the Bangalore Courts from 1967 to 1970.\n\nKnown for his no-nonsense approach to curbing anti-social elements and rioters and for bringing order to chaotic conditions on city roads in Delhi, Pereira-Kamath belonged to the Union Territories (now AGMUT) Cadre of the Indian Police Service (I.P.S.) He has worked with the Delhi, Sikkim and Mizoram police in various capacities, specialising in criminology, administration, police community relations, traffic management/road safety, and the management of public offices, productivity and personnel. He has attended seminars and conferences in various parts of the world, visiting the countries of Japan, Singapore, the U.K., Canada, and the U.S.A.\n\nMaxwell Pereira was accused by the respected academic Madhu Kishwar of having described the street vendors as 'vermins' even though the Supreme Court of India had declared their profession lawful. Allegedly Ms.Kishwar had approached him while he was still a serving policeman to curb the extortion the vendors faced at the hands of Delhi Police. This accusation was witnessed by millions on the Headlines Today programme anchored by Rahul Kanwal . He denied using the epithet but went on to say that he did consider street vending illegal despite the Supreme Court ruling. Moreover, he refused to acknowledge any error on part of Delhi Police. It is an interesting observation that while street vending might be a lawful profession, operating without a sales permit and a health permit, is definitely unlawful. The Delhi High Court in its judgement of July 2017 has ruled against street venders despite the plea of the association representing the squatters that street vending is the only source of livelihood for 800-900 families.\n\nMaxwell Pereira is the only officer unequivocally commended by repeated Commissions of Enquiry for his role in controlling the riots and carnage against members of the Sikh community during Nov-1984 Riots following the assassination of the then Prime Minister of India Mrs Indira Gandhi. Shri Pereira was especially commended in the Kusum Lata Mittal Report (on fixing specific responsibility on erring police officials) for the firm action taken by him against the advancing Mob determined to attack the Sheesh Ganj Gurdwara Sahib in Chandni Chowk and the Sikhs who had taken shelter within its precincts, by ordering the police under him to open fire, and on the spot rewarding the Head Constable Satish Chander for complying with the orders - thereby making a tremendous impact on the mob which instantly dispersed.\n\n\n"}

Funded and administered by the National Institute of Justice through a cooperative agreement with the University of North Texas Health Science Center's Center for Human Identification, all NamUs resources are provided to law enforcement, medical examiners, coroners, allied forensic professionals, and family members of missing persons.\n\nNo-cost NamUs resources include technology, forensic and analytical services, investigative support, and local, regional, and online training programs. By bringing people, information, forensic science, and technology together, NamUs helps resolve missing and unidentified person cases across the country. Services include:\n\n\nOver 600,000 individuals go missing in the United States every year. Many missing children and adults are quickly found, alive and well. However, tens of thousands of individuals remain missing for more than one year – what many agencies consider “cold cases”. A 2004 Bureau of Justice Statistics study found that each year, 4,400 unidentified bodies are recovered in the United States, with approximately 1,000 of those bodies remaining unidentified after one year. On June 15, 2018, there were over 14,000 missing person cases and over 12,000 unidentified person cases published in NamUs. The number of missing and unidentified remains in the United States has been deemed our nation's silent \"mass disaster over time\".\n\nIn 2003, the National Institute of Justice began funding major efforts to maximize the use of DNA technology in our criminal justice system, including in the investigation of missing and unidentified person cases. By 2005, the institute expanded its efforts with the “Identifying the Missing Summit”, where criminal justice practitioners, forensic scientists, policymakers, and victim advocates defined major challenges in investigating and solving missing and unidentified decedent cases. As a result of that summit, the Deputy Attorney General created the National Missing Persons Task Force, which identified the need to improve access to information that would help solve missing and unidentified person cases. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) was created to meet that need.\n\nIn 2007, the NamUs Unidentified Persons database was launched, providing medical examiners and coroners with a tool to store and share case information with criminal justice professionals and family members of missing persons across the country. The following year, the NamUs Missing Persons (MP) database was launched, and in 2009, the databases were connected for automatic case comparisons, expanding the power of NamUs to make associations between missing and unidentified persons.\n\nIn 2011, daily management of the NamUs program was transitioned to the University of North Texas Health Science Center, with continued administration and oversight by the National Institute of Justice. Management through the Center for Human Identification at the university enhanced NamUs' ability to facilitate DNA services and enhanced the quality and quantity of DNA information entered into NamUs.\n\nIn 2012, an Analytical Division was added to NamUs, offering criminal justice professionals additional resources to locate information on missing persons, locate family members for DNA sample collections and next of kin death notifications, and disposition tips and leads. Also in 2012, the NamUs AFIS/Fingerprint Unit was created, bringing additional in-house forensic services to NamUs, including a collaboration with the FBI's Latent Print Unit to search all unidentified decedent prints through the Next Generation Identification system.\n\nIn late 2015, plans to perform a complete rebuild of the NamUs application began. Stakeholders from the law enforcement, medical examiner, coroner, non-profit, and public sector were interviewed as part of a Discovery Phase to plan the features and functionality of the upgraded system. Development work began in the first quarter of 2016 and culminated in the release of the NamUs 2.0 application in May 2018.\n"}

He has formerly served as governor of Northern Bahr el Ghazal from 27 March 2008 to 2014.\n\nPaul Malong was born in the early year of 1962 in Warawar, a village situated about forty-five kilometers north of Aweil town in the former Northern Bahr el Gazal State. He was born to Aluat (mother) and Awan Anei (father). His father was a chief who governed his kinsmen in the Wun-Anei section of Abiem, situated in current Aweil East State. At eight years old, his father was killed by a member of his community. The family is survived by four children. Malong’s older siblings are deceased. In the order of their birth (excluding the deceased), the children of Anei’s first wife, who is also Malong’s mother, are Agot, Amou, him and Atak.\n\nAs a young man, Malong attended schools in his village. After his father was killed in the late 1965s, Malong moved to Muglad, where he completed primary school in 1969 in Sudan. He completed his intermediate education at St. James in Khartoum, where he participated in the clandestine formation of the Anyanya II movement in the Bahr el Gazal area.\n\nMalong has more than 100 wives.\n\nWhen he left to join the SPLM/A, arriving in July 1984 in Ethiopia, Malong, was transferred to the Steel (Hadit) Battalion of Koryom Division. He went to Officers’ Cadet and graduated with the rank of captain in July the same year. After his graduation he was transferred to Northern Upper Nile around the Maban area. He returned to Itang, which was then the second largest refugee camp in Ethiopia. After a few months of lull, he was recalled and commissioned to the rank of major in October 1985. He was then posted to Southern Blue Nile in the Eagle Battalion, where he spent three years at the battle front.\n\nIn April 2014 he was appointed Chief of General Staff of the Sudan People's Liberation Army by the president of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit. He became army chief, replacing James Hoth Mai.\n\nIn December 2016, he was flown to Nairobi, Kenya for treatment in Nairobi Hospital after he collapsed in Juba.\n\nIn May 2017, President Kiir issued a presidential decree replacing him with General James Ajonga Mawut. He left Juba with his officials, but they did not reach their destination as they were accused of making rebellion. The officials in Yirol lured Gen. Paul Malong and his companions to get back to Juba because the government was in fear that they would sparked a rebellion. But Gen. Paul Malong expelled the accuse, saying to Eye Radio on phone from Yirol, \"I want to live as a normal person, as you know that this month of May is all concerning cultivation; my tractors are already in the fields that is why you have seen me heading to Aweil\". Malong also said, \"Whatever has been said, there is no reality, because if I wanted to have a problem, that problem should be in Juba,\" he told Radio Miraya FM, a United Nations radio station.\n\nDuring the Anti-Nuer pogroms in 2013, much of the killings were carried out by a group known as \"Dot Ke Beny\" (Rescue the President) or \"Mathiang Anoor\" (Brown caterpillar), a militia of Dinkas formed for the protection of president Kiir and Paul Malong Awan. The US pushed for an arms embargo and sanctions on Machar and army chief Paul Malong Awan through the Security Council, but it failed to receive enough votes to pass in December 2016.\n"}

He organized and was the first director of the Perkins Institution.\n\nAn abolitionist, in 1863, he was one of three men appointed by the Secretary of War to the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, to investigate conditions of freedmen in the South since the Emancipation Proclamation and recommend how they could be aided in their transition to freedom. In addition to traveling to the South, Howe traveled to Canada West (now Ontario, Canada), where thousands of former slaves had escaped to freedom and established new lives; he interviewed freedmen as well as government officials in Canada.\n\nHowe was born on Pearl Street in Boston, Massachusetts on November 10, 1801. His father Joseph Neals Howe was a ship-owner and cordage manufacturer. His mother Patty (Gridley) Howe was considered to be one of the most beautiful women of her day.\n\nHowe was educated at Boston Latin School, where he was cruelly treated, and even beaten, according to his daughter. Laura (Howe) Richards later wrote: \"So far as I can remember, my father had no pleasant memories of his school days.\"\n\nBoston in the early nineteenth century was a hotbed of political foment. Howe's father was a Democrat who considered Harvard University a den of Federalists, and refused to allow his sons to enter the university. Accordingly, in 1818, Howe's father had him enrolled at Brown University. Most of his time there was spent engaged in practical jokes and other hi-jinx and, years later, Howe told his children that he regretted that he hadn't more seriously applied himself to his studies. One of his classmates, Alexis Caswell, became a doctor and future president of Brown University; he described Howe by the following: \"He showed mental capabilities which would naturally fit him for fine scholarship. His mind was quick, versatile, and inventive. I do not think he was deficient in logical power, but the severer studies did not seem to be congenial to him.\" After graduating from Brown in 1821, Howe attended Harvard Medical School, taking his degree in 1824.\n\nHowe did not remain in Massachusetts for long after graduating. In 1824, shortly after Howe was certified to practice medicine, he became fired by enthusiasm for the Greek Revolution and the example of his idol Lord Byron. Howe fled the memory of an unhappy love affair and sailed for Greece, where he joined the Greek army as a surgeon.\n\nIn Greece his services were not confined to the duties of a surgeon, but were of a more military nature. Howe's bravery, enthusiasm, and ability as a commander, as well as his humanity, won him the title \"the Lafayette of the Greek Revolution.\" Howe returned to the United States in 1827, to raise funds and supplies to help alleviate the famine and suffering in Greece. Howe's fervid appeals enabled him to collect about $60,000 which he spent on provisions, clothing, and the establishment of a relief depot for refugees near Aegina. He later formed another colony for exiles on the Isthmus of Corinth. Afterwards, Howe wrote an account of the revolt, \"Historical Sketch of the Greek Revolution\", which was published in 1828.\n\nAfter leaving Greece, Howe continued his medical studies in Paris. His enthusiasm for a republican form of government led him to take part in the July Revolution.\n\nIn 1831 he returned to the United States. Through his friend Dr. John Dix Fisher, a Boston physician who had started a movement there as early as 1826 to establish a school for the blind, he had learned of a similar school founded in Paris by Valentin Haüy. A committee organized by Fisher proposed to Howe that he direct the establishment of a New England Asylum for the Blind at Boston. He took up the project with characteristic ardor, and set out at once for Europe to investigate the problem.\nIn America he met and was chosen to bring money to the Polish revolutionaries, thus he left with two missions, to establish schools for the blind and as chairman of the American-Polish Committee at Paris, organized with J. Fenimore Cooper, S. F. B. Morse, and several other Americans living in the city, to support the revolutionaries. The Poles were defeated by the Russians and Howe was to give money to the many, particularly officers, who did not want to return home and harassed people of neighboring countries, while they were given political refuge and crossed over the Prussian border into Prussia. Dr. Howe undertook to distribute the supplies and funds personally, and while in Berlin, he was arrested and imprisoned, but managed to destroy or hide the discriminating letters to the Polish officers. After five weeks, he was released due to the intervention of the United States Minister at Paris.\n\nReturning to Boston in July 1832, Howe began receiving a few blind children at his father's house in Pleasant Street. He gradually developed what became the noted Perkins Institution. In January 1833 the funds available were all spent, but so much progress had been shown that the legislature approved funding, later increased to $30,000 a year, to the institution on condition that it should educate gratuitously twenty poor blind from the state. Collections of funds were also contributed from Salem and Boston. Colonel Thomas Handasyd Perkins, a prominent Boston trader in slaves, furs, and opium, presented his mansion and grounds in Pearl Street as a location for the school in perpetuity. This building was later found unsuitable and Colonel Perkins consented to its sale. In 1839 the institution was moved to the former Mount Washington House Hotel in South Boston. It was henceforth known as the \"Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum (or, since 1877, School for the Blind.\")\n\nHowe was director, and the life and soul of the school; he opened a printing-office and organized a fund for printing for the blind — the first done in the United States. He was a ceaseless promoter of their work. Through him, the Institution became one of the intellectual centers of American philanthropy, and by degrees obtained more and more financial support. In 1837, Howe brought to the school Laura Bridgman, a young deaf-blind girl who later became a teacher at the school. She became famous as the first known deaf-blind person to be successfully educated in the United States. Howe taught Bridgman himself. Within a few years of attendance at Perkins Institution, she learned the manual alphabet and how to write.\n\nDr. Howe originated many improvements in teaching methods, as well as in the process of printing books in Braille. Besides acting as superintendent of the Perkins Institution to the end of his life, he was instrumental in establishing numerous institutions of a similar character throughout the country.\n\nOn 23 April 1843, at the age of 41, he married the younger Julia Ward, the daughter of wealthy New York banker Samuel Ward and Julia Rush (Cutler) Ward. Julia was an ardent supporter of abolitionism and was later active in the cause of Woman's Suffrage. She composed the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" during the American Civil War.\n\nThey had a passionate and stormy marriage. Julia wrote in her diary of Dr. Howe (whom she referred to as \"Chev\"):\n\nChev is one of the characters based upon opposition. While I always seem to work for an unseen friend, he always sees an armed adversary and nerves himself accordingly. So all our lives turn on what I may call moral or personal fiction...\n\nAt one point Samuel requested a legal separation, but Julia refused. Many of their arguments centered on Julia's desire to have a career apart from motherhood. While Dr. Howe was in many ways progressive by the standards of the day, he did not support the idea of married women having any work other than that of wife and mother. He believed that Julia's proper place was in the home.\n\nThe couple had six children: Julia Romana Howe (1844–1886), who married Michael Anagnos, a Greek scholar who succeeded Dr. Howe as director of the Perkins Institute; Florence Marion Howe (1845–1922), an author, wrote a well-known treatise on manners and married David Prescott Hall, a lawyer; Henry Marion Howe (1848–1922), a metallurgist who lived in New York; Laura Elizabeth Howe (1850–1943), a Pulitzer prize-winning author, married Henry Richards and lived in Maine; Maud Howe (1855–1948), a Pulitzer prize-winning author, married John Elliott, an English muralist and illustrator; and Samuel Gridley Howe, Jr. (1858–1863), who died at age five.\n\nLaura and Florence were closest to their father and defended his opposition to Julia's activities outside the home. Florence later took up her mother's mantle as a committed suffragette, making public speeches on the subject and writing the book, \"Julia Ward Howe and the Woman Suffrage Movement\" (1913).\n\nHowe entered publicly into the antislavery struggle for the first time in 1846, when as a \"Conscience Whig\", he was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress against Robert C. Winthrop. He was one of the founders of an antislavery newspaper, the Boston \"Daily Commonwealth\", which he edited (1851–1853) with the assistance of his wife Julia Ward Howe. He was a prominent member of the Kansas Committee in Massachusetts. With Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, George Luther Stearns, Theodore Parker, and Gerrit Smith, he was interested in the plans of John Brown. Although he disapproved of the attack upon Harper's Ferry, Howe had funded John Brown's work as a member of the Secret Six. After Brown's arrest, Howe temporarily fled to Canada to escape prosecution.\n\nAccording to later accounts by Howe's daughter, Florence Hall, the Howes' South Boston home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. This is uncertain, but it is known that Dr. Howe vehemently opposed the Fugitive Slave Law. Two incidents clearly demonstrate this. The first occurred in May 1854, when Dr. Howe along with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Theodore Parker and other abolitionists, stormed Faneuil Hall in order to try to free a captured escaped slave, Anthony Burns. Burns was going to be sent back to his slave owner in Virginia in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Law. The abolitionists hoped to rescue Burns from that fate. Howe declared outside the hall that \"No man's freedom is safe until all men are free.\" Shortly afterward the abolitionists stormed the hall, breaking through the door with a battering ram. A deputy was accidentally shot in the ensuing fracas. Federal troops finally put an end to the attempted raid, and Burns was returned to Virginia. The men did not abandon Burns, however, and within a year of his capture, they had raised enough money to purchase Burns' freedom from his slave owner.\n\nIn another violation of the Fugitive Slave Law, in October 1854, with the help of Capt. Austin Bearse and his brother, Dr. Howe rescued an escaped slave who had entered Boston Harbor from Jacksonville, Florida as a stowaway aboard the brig \"Cameo\". The Boston Vigilance Committee helped the man evade slave-catchers and reach freedom.\n\nIn 1863 during the American Civil War, Dr. Howe was appointed to the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, and traveled both to the Deep South and to Canada to investigate the condition of emancipated slaves. Freedmen in Canada had often reached it via the Underground Railroad. Life in Canada wasn't free from the bigotry that Freedmen and women suffered in the northern states as well as the South, but Howe found that their lives as free people were much improved. He noted that they were enfranchised and their rights protected by the government. Howe noted they were free to earn a living, marry, attend school and church out of the reach of slave-catchers. An account of his interviews and experiences were published in 1864, \"The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West.\" He submitted his report to the Secretary of War, and it became part of the Commission's material for Congress. It contributed to passage of the law establishing the Freedmen's Bureau, considered needed to aid the southern freedmen in transition.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Howe was one of the directors of the Sanitary Commission. The goal of the Sanitary Commission was to raise funds to improve hygiene standards and prevent outbreaks of disease at Union camps, which were breeding grounds for illnesses like dysentery, typhoid and malaria, as well as to provide supplies and medical services to troops.\n\nAt the close of the Civil War, Dr. Howe entered into the work of the Freedmen's Bureau. His work with the Freemen's Bureau served as an extension of his work as an abolitionist. It was the job of the Freedmen's Bureau to help house, feed, clothe, educate and provide medical care to newly freed slaves in the South after the Civil War. In some instances, Bureau staff would also try to aid the freedmen to locate and reunite with relatives who had either fled north or who had been sold away during slavery.\n\nDr. Howe, working with Dorothea Dix, also brought about the establishment of the \"Massachusetts School for Idiot and Feeble-Minded Youth\", the Western Hemisphere's oldest publicly funded institution serving the mentally disabled. He founded the school in 1848 with a $2,500 appropriation from the Massachusetts Legislature. \"Idiot\" was at that time considered a polite term for individuals with mental and intellectual disabilities. Dr. Howe was successful in his attempt to educate the mentally disabled, but this led to other problems. Some commentators argued that the disabled did so well in schools such as Howe's that they should permanently reside there. Dr. Howe was opposed to this, arguing that the mentally disabled had rights and that segregating them from the rest of society would be detrimental.\n\nIn 1866, Howe gave the keynote address at the opening of the New York State Institution for the Blind at Batavia, New York. He shocked the audience by warning about the dangers of segregation based on disability:\n\nWe should be cautious about establishing such artificial communities...for any children and youth; but more especially should we avoid them for those who have natural infirmity...Such persons spring up sporadically in the community, and they should be kept diffused among sound and normal persons...Surround insane and excitable persons with sane people and ordinary influences; vicious children with virtuous people and virtuous influences; blind children with those who see; mute children with those who speak; and the like...\n\nHowe founded the State Board of Charities of Massachusetts in 1863, the first board of the sort in the United States. He served as its chairman from that time until 1874.\n\nHowe made a last trip to Greece in 1866, to carry relief to the Cretan refugees during the Cretan Revolution.\n\nSamuel Howe remained active and politically involved until the end of his life.\n\nIn 1865, Howe openly advocated a progressive tax system, which he referred to as a \"sliding scale of taxation proportionate to income.\" He stated that the wealthy would resist this, but explained that the United States could not become a truly just society while the gap between rich and poor remained so cavernous. Emancipating the slaves and charity work alone were not enough, he insisted, to bridge the inequities, \n\nso long as the labors and drudgery of the world is thrown actively upon one class, while another class is entirely exempt from it. There is a radical injustice in it. And injustice in society is like a rotten timber in the foundation of a house.\n\nIn 1870 he was a member of the commission sent by President Grant to inquire into the practicability of the annexation of Santo Domingo. President Grant wished to annex the island. He was opposed in this effort by Sen.Charles Sumner, a longtime friend and ally of Howe's. In the end, the committee sided with Sumner in opposition to the proposed annexation. Grant was so enraged at having his plans thwarted that he arranged to have Sumner removed from his chairmanship as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nSamuel Gridley Howe died on January 9, 1876. His remains are buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "640856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=640856", "title": "Yūrei", "text": "Yūrei\n\nLike their Chinese and Western counterparts, they are thought to be spirits kept from a peaceful afterlife.\n\nAccording to traditional Japanese beliefs, all humans have a spirit or soul called a 霊魂 (\"reikon\"). When a person dies, the \"reikon\" leaves the body and enters a form of purgatory, where it waits for the proper funeral and post-funeral rites to be performed, so that it may join its ancestors. If this is done correctly, the \"reikon\" is believed to be a protector of the living family and to return yearly in August during the Obon Festival to receive thanks.\n\nHowever, if the person dies in a sudden or violent manner such as murder or suicide, if the proper rites have not been performed, or if they are influenced by powerful emotions such as a desire for revenge, love, jealousy, hatred or sorrow, the \"reikon\" is thought to transform into a \"yūrei\", which can then bridge the gap back to the physical world. The emotion or thought need not be particularly strong or driving, and even innocuous thoughts can cause a death to become disturbed. Once a thought enters the mind of a dying person, their Yūrei will come back to complete the action last thought of before returning to the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nThe \"yūrei\" then exists on Earth until it can be laid to rest, either by performing the missing rituals, or resolving the emotional conflict that still ties it to the physical plane. If the rituals are not completed or the conflict left unresolved, the \"yūrei\" will persist in its haunting.\n\nOftentimes the lower the social rank of the person who died violently, or who was treated harshly during life, the more powerful as a \"yūrei\" they would return. This is illustrated in the fate of Oiwa in the story \"Yotsuya Kaidan\", or the servant Okiku in \"Banchō Sarayashiki\".\n\nIn the late 17th century, a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular, and kaidan increasingly became a subject for theater, literature and other arts. Ukiyo-e artist Maruyama Ōkyo created the first known example of the now-traditional yūrei, in his painting \"The Ghost of Oyuki\". The Zenshō-an in Tokyo houses the largest single collection of \"yūrei\" paintings which are only shown in August, the traditional month of the spirits.\n\nToday, the appearance of yūrei is somewhat uniform, instantly signalling the ghostly nature of the figure, and assuring that it is culturally authentic.\n\n\nWhile all Japanese ghosts are called yūrei, within that category there are several specific types of phantom, classified mainly by the manner they died or their reason for returning to Earth.\n\n\nThere are two types of ghosts specific to Buddhism, both being examples of unfulfilled earthly hungers being carried on after death. They are different from other classifications of yūrei due to their wholly religious nature.\n\n\nIn Japanese folklore, not only the dead are able to manifest their reikon for a haunting. Living creatures possessed by extraordinary jealousy or rage can release their spirit as an ikiryō 生き霊, a living ghost that can enact its will while still alive.\n\nThe most famous example of an ikiryo is Rokujō no Miyasundokoro, from the novel \"The Tale of Genji\". A mistress of the titular Genji who falls deeply in love with him, the lady Rokujō is an ambitious woman whose ambition is denied upon the death of her husband. The jealousy she repressed over Genji transformed her slowly into a demon, and then took shape as an Ikiryō upon discovering that Genji's wife was pregnant. This Ikiryō possessed Genji's wife, ultimately leading to her demise. Upon realising that her jealousy had caused this misfortune, she locked herself away and became a nun until her death, after which time her spirit continued to haunt Genji until her daughter performed the correct spiritual rites.\n\nYūrei often fall under the general umbrella term of obake, derived from the verb bakeru, meaning \"to change\"; thus obake are preternatural beings who have undergone some sort of change, from the natural realm to the supernatural.\n\nHowever, Yūrei differ from traditional \"bakemono\" due to their temporal specificity. The Yūrei is one of the only creatures in Japanese mythology to have a preferred haunting time (the hour of the bull, around 2:00-2:30am, the witching hour for Japan, when the veils between the world of the dead and the world of the living are at their thinnest). By comparison, normal \"obake\" could strike at any time, often darkening or changing their surroundings should they feel the need. Similarly, Yūrei are more bound to specific locations of haunting than the average \"bakemono,\" which are free to haunt any place without being bound to it.\"\"\n\nYanagita Kunio generally distinguishes Yūrei from Obake by noting that Yūrei tend to have a specific purpose for their haunting, such as vengeance or completing unfinished business. While for many Yūrei this business is concluded, some Yūrei such as the famed Okiku remain earthbound due to the fact that their business is not possible to complete. In Okiku's case, this business is counting plates hoping to find a full set, but the last plate is invariably missing or broken according to the different retellings of the story. This means that her spirit can never find peace, and thus will remain a \"jibakurei\".\n\nSome famous locations that are said to be haunted by yūrei are the well of Himeji Castle, haunted by the ghost of Okiku, and Aokigahara, the forest at the bottom of Mt. Fuji, which is a popular location for suicide. A particularly powerful onryō, Oiwa, is said to be able to bring vengeance on any actress portraying her part in a theater or film adaptation.\n\nOkiku, Oiwa, and the lovesick Otsuya together make up the of Japanese culture. These are Yūrei whose stories have been passed down and retold throughout the centuries, and whose characteristics along with their circumstances and fates have formed a large part of Japanese art and society.\n\nThe easiest way to exorcise a yūrei is to help it fulfill its purpose. When the reason for the strong emotion binding the spirit to Earth is gone, the yūrei is satisfied and can move on. Traditionally, this is accomplished by family members enacting revenge upon the yūrei's slayer, or when the ghost consummates its passion/love with its intended lover, or when its remains are discovered and given a proper burial with all rites performed.\n\nThe emotions of the onryō are particularly strong, and they are the least likely to be pacified by these methods.\n\nOn occasion, Buddhist priests and mountain ascetics were hired to perform services on those whose unusual or unfortunate deaths could result in their transition into a vengeful ghost, a practice similar to exorcism. Sometimes these ghosts would be deified in order to placate their spirits.\n\nLike many monsters of Japanese folklore, malicious yūrei are repelled by , holy Shinto writings containing the name of a kami. The ofuda must generally be placed on the yūrei's forehead to banish the spirit, although they can be attached to a house's entry ways to prevent the yūrei from entering.\n\n\n\n"}
