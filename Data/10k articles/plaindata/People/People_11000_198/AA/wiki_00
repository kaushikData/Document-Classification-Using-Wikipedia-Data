He is a former professor and the head of the department of biochemistry at the Bose Institute, Kolkata and an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India and The World Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1988, for his contributions to biological sciences.\n\nBorn on 2 December 1944 in Kolkata, in the Indian state of West Bengal to Bhabaranjan-Malancha couple, Bhattacharyya graduated in chemistry from the University of Calcutta and secured his master's degree in physical chemistry from the same university. Subsequently, he joined the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata and pursued his doctoral studies to secure the degree under the guidance of Uma Shankar Nandi of the Indian Institute of Science. Moving to the US, he completed his post-doctoral studies at the laboratory of Jan Wolff of the National Institutes of Health. He returned to India in 1976 to join Bose Institute as a CSIR pool officer where he shifted to academics as a lecturer in 1978 and continued his service till his superannuation as a professor and head of the department of biochemistry. He has also been associated with Presidency College, Calcutta as a professor at their Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.\n\nBhattacharyya's early work during his post-doctoral studies at Jan Wolff's laboratory were on tubulin and its binding mechanism with antimitotic drugs. Later, he focused his researches on colchicine-tubulin interaction and elucidated the effect of the \"carbonyl group on the side chain of B-ring\" in the irreversible binding of colchicine. He demonstrated the fluorescence of colchicine-tubilin bind which is reported to have offered an alternative to radio-labeled colchicine in pharmacological assays and made the study of the kinetics of colchicine binding easier. He studied the \"mechanism of chaperone-like activity of tubulin and microtubule associated proteins\" and his studies have known to be of significance in the design of lead compounds as well as new drugs for the treatment of cancer. He has published several articles detailing his research findings, has registered patents for his work and has mentored many scholars in their doctoral studies. His scientific career has been documented in an article, \"Dr. Bablu Bhattacharyya: A Journey of Four Decades with Tubulin\", published in 2015. He has also been associated with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Department of Science and Technology, Indian National Science Academy and the Indian Academy of Sciences as a member of their various technical committees.\n\nThe Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1988.

He was strongly influenced by German Expressionism, and was known for his landscapes and portraiture. Important early group exhibitions include The Antipodeans, the exhibition for which Bernard Smith drafted a manifesto in support of Australian figurative painting, an exhibition in which Arthur Boyd, David Boyd, John Brack, Robert Dickerson, John Perceval and Charles Blackman showed; a joint exhibition with Barry Humphries, in which the two responded to Dadaism; and Group of Four at the Victorian Artists Society Gallery with Pugh, John Howley, Don Laycock and Lawrence Daws.\n\nPugh was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1985 for service to Australian Art. In 1990 he was appointed as the Australian War Memorial's official artist at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the Gallipoli landing.\n\nPugh was born in Richmond, Victoria. Both Pugh's parents were amateur painters, and as a young man during the 1940s Pugh attended evening classes at the Swinburne Technical College to study cartoon drawing. Two years later whilst living in Adelaide he took evening classes in life drawing at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts.\n\nPugh served with the AIF in New Guinea during World War II and with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan after the war. A group of Japanese soldiers surrendered to the unit with which Pugh was fighting during a lull in fighting, and on receiving orders to proceed Pugh and others shot and killed them. This incident and the guilt he felt affected his attitude to war (he became a pacifist) and his painting.\n\nAfter serving in World War II, with the financial support of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme, Pugh returned to Melbourne and enrolled in the National Gallery of Victoria Art School.\n\nPugh was heavily influenced by German Expressionism. He read Sheldon Cheney's \"The Story of Modern Art\" (1941) while recuperating in hospital in New Guinea during World War II. Pugh's primary influence was Wassily Kandinsky: \"I can see Kandinsky in everything I do.\" His training at the National Gallery School gave him a strong foundation in drawing and he learned the tonal painting technique, but when he took his teacher William (Bill) Dargie to see the first of Sidney Nolan's Kelly and Dargie's attitude was dismissive, Pugh left the school to develop his own ideas.\n\nIn 1951 Pugh bought of bushland near Cottles Bridge, northeast of Melbourne, which he named \"Dunmoochin\". Pugh at first camped on the site, then built a wattle-and-daub shack.\n\nArtists, potters and others also settled at the site. In order to protect and jointly control the area they formed the Dunmoochin Artists Co-operative with a constitution of 13 articles. It was not a commune in any sense of the word except that the titles were communally held.\nWhen the co-operative eventually disbanded each member took a section of the land. Artists who worked or resided at Dunmoochin have included\nRick Amor,\nFrank Hodgkinson,\nJohn Howley,\nHelen Laycock,\nPeter Laycock,\nMirka Mora,\nKevin Nolan,\nJohn Olsen,\nJohn Perceval,\nAlma Shanahan,\nAlbert Tucker,\nFrank Werther,\nFred Williams\nand Peter and Chris Wiseman.\n\nPugh travelled across the Nullarbor Plain to Perth in 1954 then the Kimberley in 1956. These journeys led to radical changes in his style. Pugh encountered indigenous Australian art for the first time and began utilizing incision, cross-hatching and collage. The work inspired by these journeys was part of the Group of Four Exhibits in 1955 and 1956.\n\nIn 1959 Pugh wrote to Bernard Smith:\nClose observation of nature and its cyclical and savage rhythms became a constant theme in Pugh's painting.\n\nPugh held his first solo show in 1957 at the Victorian Artists Society Gallery, where he displayed landscapes and portraits. The show was well received by critics. Col. Aubrey Gibson, chairman of the National Gallery, was an early patron, as were a group of businessmen led by David Yencken and the businessman Andrew Grimwade. Pugh joined the stable of the Sydney art dealer Rudy Komon. Komon paid his artists a stipend, balanced against sales of their work, and this generosity made them very loyal, as it gave them stability and freedom from daily money worries.\n\nPugh had consistent official support in the crucial early stages of his career. His inclusion in the 1961 Whitechapel and 1963 Tate exhibitions of Australian art gave him international exposure. In 1966 Komon arranged a one-man show for Pugh at the Artists' Guild Gallery in St Louis in the United States; The Commonwealth Institute staged a retrospective of his work in 1970. He was represented in London by Andre Kalman, who showed him in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1979, and with the Athol Gallery on the Isle of Man.\n\nThe Historic Memorials Committee bought his 1964 portrait of the Governor-General Lord De L'Isle and his 1972 portrait of Gough Whitlam.\n\nPugh's fame as an artist grew in the 1970s following the print publication of two radio plays by Ivan Smith: \"Death of a Wombat\" and \"Dingo King\", both of which featured Pugh's drawings and paintings.\n\nPugh worked with the printmaker Stanley Hayter for three months in Paris in 1970. He brought Hayter’s oil viscosity printing technique back to Australia the same year. Pugh and John Olsen purchased an etching press and operated it at Dunmoochin. In 1971 Pugh invited Frank Hodgkinson to move to Dunmoochin and Pugh's \"enthusiasm proved to be a major stimulus for Hodgkinson's printmaking.\"\n\nPugh chaired the Victorian ALP Arts Policy Committee from 1971, and Gough Whitlam appointed Pugh to the Australia Council for the Arts in 1973. Pugh made public his disagreements with Council chairman H C \"Nugget\" Coombes who refused to implement the policy Pugh and his fellow committee members had crafted and then taken through the processes of the Victorian and Federal ALP conferences to become official ALP arts policy. Pugh resigned from the Council in 1974.\n\nPugh's brother and grandnephew had protanope colour vision deficiency and it is probable that he did on biographical, gene pedigree inheritance and other grounds (such as failing the colour vision test when endeavouring to enlist in the Navy).\n\nPugh married three times: to June Byford, Marlene Harvey and Judith Ley. Pugh had two sons with Marlene, Shane and Dailan.\n\nPugh became a pacifist during World War II, while on active service, and retained this position during the Vietnam War. He joined the Labor Party to campaign for the end of Australia's involvement in that War.\nThe marriage to Marlene ended in 1969, they divorced in 1971. In 1970 Pugh met Judith. He became very well known, as he and Judith used his status as a painter to improve that of the ALP. They did this in order to ensure the election of the ALP as Pugh was an anti war activist. They separated in 1980 and divorced in 1981. He lived for some years with Adrianne Strammp, who trained as a painter.\n\nPugh returned to painting full-time after his experience with the Australia Council, and despite suffering three heart attacks and minor ischaemic episodes, continued to paint and make prints until his fatal heart attack in 1990. Pugh established the Dunmoochin Foundation which now forms part of his legacy, and provides residences for artists in his bush property.\n\nPugh also donated Dunmoochin land to the Victorian Conservation Trust (now Trust for Nature) in 1989. Two plants of national significance have been recorded on this land.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1944, Ballard and her son, Donald Ballard, were charged with mail fraud and their court case would eventually be ruled by the US Supreme Court as \"United States v. Ballard\". Ballard's work with the I AM Movement is considered a predecessor to the current new age movement.\n\nEdna Anne Wheeler was born in 1886 in Burlington, Iowa. Her mother was Anna Hewitt Pearce and her father was Edward G. Wheeler, a railway clerk. Ballard became a concert harpist in 1912. In 1916, Ballard married Guy W. Ballard. Two years later, in 1918, she had a child with Guy, named Donald.\n\nThe couple resided in Chicago, Illinois. Ballard began working at the Philosopher's Nook, an occult bookstore. She also served as an editor of \"American Occultists.\" Guy was also interested in the occult, and while hiking at Mt. Shasta in California in September 1931 he met an individual who claimed to be St. Germain. Ballard called Saint Germain an \"ascended master.\" Guy wrote back to Ballard, telling her about his interaction(s) with St. Germain. In 1931, the couple founded the Saint Germain Foundation and Saint Germain Press in Chicago. The called the umbrella over the two organizations the I AM Movement. \n\nBallard's role within the Movement was as \"accredited messenger of the ascended masters,\" alongside Guy. However, Ballard eventually took a step back as Guy led the organizations, serving as the primary messenger for St. Germain and other masters, including Jesus. The Ballard's believed in past lives with Ballard believing she was Elizabeth I and Joan of Arc in her past lives.\n\nIn 1939, Guy died and their son, Donald Ballard became the leader of the I AM Movement. Prior to his father's death, Donald also served as a messenger per the wishes of St. Germain. However, both he and Ballard did not serve as primary messenger. Shortly thereafter, Ballard, Donald and other staff members were charged with mail fraud, with the charge being that the Movement was attempting to defraud mail recipients into joining a religion that was known to be false. Ballard was convicted twice, the second time after a ruling was overturned. The case went to the US Supreme Court and was ruled as \"United States v. Ballard\". \n\nBallard eventually began serving as a messenger for St. Germain and other masters in the fifties and in the sixties she hosted a radio show. \n\nBallard died in February 1971 in Chicago. After her death, the Saint Germain Foundation and press were operated by the board of directors and select \"appointed messengers.\" Additionally, no other Movement members, including appointment messengers, have served as direct messengers of the masters, including St. Germain. During her role as messenger, Ballard left over 2,000 recordings of messages from St. Germain and the masters. \n"}

{"id": "2682894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2682894", "title": "French name", "text": "French name\n\nThis article describes the conventions for using people's names in France, including the norms of custom and practice, as well as the legal aspects.\n\nIn normal polite usage, a person's name is usually preceded by:\nSince 2013, French administration does not use the term \"mademoiselle\" anymore for its documents in favour of \"madame\" regardless of the status and the age of the woman addressed.\n\nDuring the \"Ancien Régime\", a female commoner was always addressed as \"mademoiselle\", even when married, \"madame\" being limited to women of the high nobility, even if they were not married. This practice ceased after the French Revolution.\n\nA traditional address to a crowd of people is \"Mesdames, Messieurs\" or \"Mesdames, Mesdemoiselles, Messieurs\" — whose order of words represents decreasing degrees of respect. An informal variant is \"Messieurs-Dames\"; it is considered as ill-mannered by purists.\n\nIt is normally impolite to address people by their given names unless one is a family member, a friend or a close colleague of comparable hierarchic importance. One also does not address people by their last name only unless in a work environment. Also, contrary to English or German usage, it is considered impolite to address someone as \"monsieur X\" when talking to that person: a mere \"monsieur\" should be used, \"monsieur X\" being reserved for talking about M. X to another person.\n\nWhen speaking of someone, \"monsieur/madame given name family name\", by far the most polite form of address, is generally reserved for the most solemn occasions. \"Monsieur/madame family name\" or \"given name family name\" is polite and used in normal formal occasions, as well as in the formal quality press (\"Le Monde\", \"Le Monde diplomatique\", for example). By contrast, in colloquial usage the family names of personalities are used alone. Formally, a married or widowed woman can be called by the given name of her husband (\"madame (given name of husband) family name\" or \"madame veuve (given name of husband) family name\"); this is now slightly out of fashion, except on formal invitation cards (in France, on a formal invitation card, the traditional formula is always a variant of \"Madame Jean Dupont recevra...\". The traditional use of the first name of the woman's husband is now felt in this context as a way to include the husband as equally inviting alongside his wife, while keeping the tradition of reception being formally held by the wife.\n\nIn the workplace or in academic establishments, particularly in a male-dominated environment, it is quite common to refer to male employees by their family name only, but to use \"madame\" or \"mademoiselle\" before the names of female employees.\n\nA military officer is addressed by his rank (and under no circumstance by \"monsieur\", but a group of officers can be addressed by plural \"messieurs\"). Male officers of the Army, the Gendarmerie and the Air Force are addressed as \"Mon [rank]\" by inferior ranks and deferential civilians. This usage is said not to be the possessive pronoun \"mon\", but an abbreviation of \"monsieur\": consequently, women are not referred to with \"mon\", but with the rank alone (for example \"Général\" rather than \"mon Général\"). Superiors address their inferiors by their rank only, never with \"Mon\".\n\nAs a punishment by Napoléon Bonaparte, Navy officers have not been addressed as \"mon\" since the Battle of Trafalgar. Confusingly, the title generally does not match the rank, but rather an equivalent rank in other forces: \"lieutenant\" is the form of address for an \"enseigne de vaisseau\", \"capitaine\" for a \"lieutenant de vaisseau\", and \"commandant\" for a \"capitaine de corvette\", \"frégate\", or \"vaisseau\".\n\nIn everyday written contexts, ranks are abbreviated.\n\nFrench people have one, two or more given names (first names). One of them (nowadays almost always the first, in the past often the last) is used in daily life (but someone can also choose a usage name that was not given); the others are solely for official documents, such as passport, birth, death and marriage certificates. Thus, one always speaks of \"Jacques Chirac\" and never of \"Jacques René Chirac\"; and \"Henri Philippe Pétain\" is always referred to as Philippe Pétain (or Marshal Pétain), because \"Philippe\" was the given name that he used in daily life. Middle names in the English sense do not exist, and middle initials are never used for second or further given names. For example, although English-speaking scientific publications may cite Claude Allègre as \"Claude J. Allègre\", this is never done in France. Typically, second and further given names may be somewhat old-fashioned, given in honour of the child's grandparents etc., though such practice has now become less common. As with English, however, a person may choose to use any one (or several) of their names, relegating the unused names to the birth certificate. Although using more than one name is nowadays out of fashion, using two or even three of the given names as a compound name was fairly common until the early 20th century.\n\nTraditionally, most people were given names from the Roman Catholic calendar of saints. Common names of this type are \"Jacques\" (James), \"Jean\" (John), \"Michel\" (Michael), \"Pierre\" (Peter), or \"Jean-Baptiste\" (John the Baptist) for males; and \"Marie\" (Mary), \"Jeanne\" (Jane), \"Marguerite\" (Margaret), \"Françoise\" (Frances), or \"Élisabeth\" (Elizabeth) for females. In certain regions such as Brittany or Corsica, more local names (usually of local saints) are often used (in Brittany, for instance, male \"Corentin\" or female \"Anne\"; in Corsica, \"Ange\" (suitable both for males and females, French version corresponding to Corsican \"Angelo\", \"Angela\"). However, given names for French citizens from immigrant communities are often from their own culture, such as \"Mohammed, Karim\", \"Saïd\", \"Toufik\", \"Jorge\", etc. for males, \"Fatima\", \"Fatoumata\", etc. for females. Furthermore, in recent decades it has become common to use first names of English or other foreign origin, mainly in the popular classes of the society, such as \"Kevin\", \"Enzo\", or \"Anthony\" (instead of \"Antoine\" in the upper classes) for males; for females, \"Jessica\", \"Jennifer\", \"Karine\" or \"Barbara\" (instead of \"Barbe\", now out-of-fashion, because it sounds exactly the same as \"barbe\" \"beard\" as in the expression \"la barbe!\" \"What a drag! / How boring!\"). Also, females are often given names like Jacqueline and Géraldine that are feminine forms of traditional common masculine French names.\n\nThe prevalence of given names follows trends, with some names being popular in some years, and some considered definitely out-of-fashion. As an example, few children born since 1970 would bear the name \"Germaine\", which is generally associated with the idea of an elderly lady. However, as noted above, such old-fashioned names are frequently used as second or third given names, because in France the second or further given names are traditionally those of the godparents or the grandparents. Some older names, such as \"Suzanne\", \"Violette\", and \"Madeleine\", have become fashionable again in the upper class and in the upper middle class. Others such as \"Jean\", \"Pierre\", \"Louis\", and \"François\" never really went out of fashion. \"Alexandre\" (Alexander) was never very popular, but is not uncommon in middle and upper classes.\n\nAlmost all traditional given names are gender-specific. However, a few given names, such as \"Dominique\" (see above: completely gender-neutral), \"Claude\" (traditionally masculine), and \"Camille\" (traditionally masculine, now mostly feminine), are given to both males and females; for others, the pronunciation is the same but the spelling is different: \"Frédéric\" (m) / \"Frédérique\" (f). In medieval times, a woman was often named \"Philippe\" (Philippa), now an exclusively masculine name (Philip), or a male \"Anne\" (Ann), now almost exclusively feminine (except as second or third given name, mostly in Brittany). From the middle 19th-century into the early 20th-century, \"Marie\" was a popular first name for both men or women, however, before and after this period it has been almost exclusively given to women as a first given name, even if the practice still exists to give it to males as second or third given name, especially in devout Catholic families.\n\nCompound given names, such as \"Jean-Luc\", \"Jean-Paul\", or \"Anne-Sophie\" are not uncommon. These are not considered to be two separate given names. The second part of a compound name may be a given name normally used by the opposite sex. However, the gender of the compound is determined by the first component. Thus, Marie-George Buffet has a given name considered as female because it begins with \"Marie\", and \"George\" is spelled with a final \"-e\" like all the traditional French female given names, instead of \"Georges\" with \"-es\" for a male. The feminine component in male compound names is mostly \"Marie\", as in Jean-Marie Vianney. In the past, some Frenchmen would have \"Marie\" or \"Anne\" as first name (example: Anne du Bourg), which is still nowadays in practice in rare traditional Catholic families (but then the man will have other given names and one of those will be used in everyday life). Second or third given names, which usually are kept private, may also include names normally used by the opposite gender. For instance, in 2006, 81 Frenchmen have \"Brigitte\" among their given names, 97 \"Catherine\", 133 \"Anne\", and 204 \"Julie\". In addition to the above-described custom of using \"Marie\" for males, this is due to the habit of traditional Catholic French families to give children the names of their godmother and godfather: if there is no counterpart of the opposite gender for the name of the godparent who is not of the same sex as the child, generally the name of the godparent will be left as such. For instance, a male child born to a traditional Catholic family choosing for him the name \"Nicolas\" and whose godparents are called \"Christian\" and \"Véronique\" could be called \"Nicolas Christian Marie Véronique\".\n\nFirst names are chosen by the child's parents. There are no legal \"a priori\" constraints on the choice of names nowadays, but this has not always been the case. The choice of given names, originally limited only by the tradition of naming children after a small number of popular saints, was restricted by law at the end of the 18th century, could be accepted. Much later, actually in 1966, a new law permitted a limited number of mythological, regional or foreign names, substantives (Olive, Violette), diminutives, and alternative spellings. Only in 1993 were French parents given the freedom to name their child without any constraint whatsoever. However, if the birth registrar thinks that the chosen names (alone or in association with the last name) may be detrimental to the child's interests, or to the right of other families to protect their own family name, the registrar may refer the matter to the local prosecutor, who may choose to refer the matter to the local court. The court may then refuse the chosen names. Such refusals are rare and mostly concern given names that may expose the child to mockery.\n\nTo change a given name, a request can be made before a court (\"juge des affaires familiales\"), but except in a few specific cases (such as the Gallicization of a foreign name), it is necessary to prove a legitimate interest for the change (usually that the current name is a cause of mockery or when put together with the surname, it creates a ridiculous word or sentence, e.g.: \"Jean Bon\" sounds \"jambon\" \"ham\", or \"Annick Mamère\" = \"A nique ma mère\", slang for \"she f**ks my mother\").\n\nIn France, until 1 January 2005, children were required by law to take the surname of their father. If the father was unknown, the child was given the family name of the mother. Since 1 January 2005, article 311-21 of the French Civil code permits parents to give their children the name of either their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both - although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, both parents' family names are hyphenated, in alphabetic order, with only the first of their names, if they each have a hyphenated name themselves. A 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requires member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was repeated by the United Nations in 1979. Similar measures were adopted by Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983), Spain (1999), and Austria (2013).\n\nIn France, a person may use a name of a third party (called the common name) in the following circumstances:\n\n\nSince Law No. 2003-516 of 18 June 2003 on the devolution of family names, there is no longer any distinction between the name of the mother and the father. A child may receive the family name of one or the other, or both family names. Decree No. 2004-1159 of 29 October 2004 implemented Law No. 2002-304 of 4 March 2002, provided that children born on or after 1 January 2004 and children changing names, may have or use only the family name of the father or the mother or both family names. However, whichever form is used, a person's name must be used consistently on all identification documents, such as a passport or identity card.\n\nThe ratio of the number of family names to the population is high in France, due to the fact that most surnames had many orthographic and dialectal variants (more than 40 for some), which were registered as separate names around 1880 when \"\" were issued. According to the French Institute for Statistics INSEE, more than 1,300,000 surnames were registered in the country between 1891 and 1990, and about 200,000 have disappeared (mainly orthographic variants). It is believed that the number of family names at any time since 1990 hovers between 800,000 and 1,200,000. Not all family names are of French origin, as many families have some immigrant roots.\n\nAccording to different estimates, 50 to 80 percent of French citizens may bear rare family names (fewer than 50 bearers alive at the census time).\n\nThe list for France is different according to the sources. A list including the births between 1891 and 1990 shows : 1 - Martin, 2 - Bernard, 3 - Thomas, 4 - Petit, 5 - Robert, 6 - Richard, 7 - Durand, 8 - Dubois, 9 - Moreau, 10 - Laurent.\n\nA list of birth between 1966 and 1990 yields: 1 - Martin, 2 - Bernard, 3 - Thomas, 4 - Robert, 5 - Petit, 6 - Dubois, 7 - Richard, 8 - Garcia (Spanish), 9 - Durand, 10 - Moreau.\n\nThis list masks strong regional differences in France and the increasing number of foreign names among the French citizens. Table based on births between 1966 and 1990:\n\nSome French last names include the word \"De-\" (\"of\") or \"Du-\" (contraction for \"de\" + \"le\" = \"of the\"), when it is masculine and \"De la-\" when it is feminine, but there are regional variations : in the North of France \"Du-\" is often rendered by \"Dele-\" and in the South of France \"Del-\". When \"de\" is separated, it is known as a particle. A particle \"de\" should not be alphabetized in name lists, The \"particule\" generally indicates some land or feudal origin of the name, being associated with claims to a place, but this is not always the case. The name de Gaulle, for example, is not a traditional French name with a \"particule\", but a Flemish Dutch name that evolved from a form of \"De Walle\" meaning \"the wall\". \n\nA popular misconception is that the \"particule\" \"De-\" included in the name always indicates membership of the nobility, that is to say, an original separated \"de\" that was linked to the name during the French revolution as \"De-\". That is sometimes true. Almost all nobility titles are of the form [title] <nowiki>[</nowiki>particle [name of the land]: for instance, \"Louis, duc d'Orléans\" (\"Louis, duke of Orléans\"), or simply \"Louis d'Orléans\". However, many non-noble people also have \"particules\" in their names, simply because they indicate some geographic origin or property. An example from current political life is Dominique de Villepin. Former president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's father had his surname legally changed from \"Giscard\" to \"Giscard d'Estaing\" in 1922, claiming the name of a family line extinct since the French Revolution. \n\nAdding a \"particule\" was one way for people of non-noble origins to pretend they were nobles. In the 19th century wealthy commoners buying nobility titles were derisively called \"Monsieur de Puispeu\", a pun on \"depuis peu\" meaning \"since recently\". Similarly, during the French Revolution, when being associated with the nobility was out of favor and even risky, some people dropped the \"de\" from their name, or omitted the mention of their feudal titles (see image). \n\nIn some cases, names with \"particules\" are made of a normal family name and the name of an estate (or even of several estates). Thus, Dominique de Villepin is \"Dominique Galouzeau de Villepin\"; Hélie de Saint Marc is \"Hélie Denoix de Saint Marc\" (in both cases, omitting second or other given names). As in these examples, most people with such long family names shorten their name for common use, by keeping only the first estate name (such as Viscount Philippe Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon, assuming in everyday life the name of Philippe de Villiers) or, in some cases, only the family name. Whether the family name or the estate name is used for the shortened form depends on a variety of factors: how people feel bearing a \"particule\" (people may for instance dislike the connotations of nobility that the \"particule\" entails; on the other hand, they may enjoy the impression of nobility), tradition, etc. For instance, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing is never referred to as \"d'Estaing\", probably because his \"particule\" is a recent addition to the family surname by his father. On the contrary, he is often simply referred to in the press as \"Giscard\".\n\nTraditionally, the \"particule\" \"de\" is omitted when citing the name of a person without a preceding given name, title (\"baron\", \"duc\" etc.), job description (\"général\", \"colonel\", etc.) or polite address (\"monsieur\", \"madame\", \"mademoiselle\"). Thus, one would say \"Monsieur de La Vieuville\", but if calling him familiarly by his last name only, \"La Vieuville\" (note the initial capital letter); the same applies for \"Gérard de La Martinière\", who would be called \"La Martinière\". Similarly, Philippe de Villiers talks about the votes he receives as \"le vote Villiers\". However, this usage is now losing ground to a more egalitarian treatment of surnames; it is, for instance, commonplace to hear people talking of \"de Villiers\". \nNote that American English language medial capital spellings such as \"DeVilliers\" are never used in France.\n\nContrary to popular belief, and also contrary to the practice of some other countries, French women do not legally change names when they marry. However, it is customary that they take their husband's name as a \"usage name\". This is not a legal obligation (it is a \"contra legem\" custom, as French law since the Revolution requiring that no one may be called by any other name than that written on their birth certificate), and not all women decide to do so. However, if they do, they may retain the use of this name, depending on circumstances, even after a divorce. In some cases, the wife, or both spouses, choose to adopt a double-barreled, hyphenated surname made from joining the surnames of both partners. Thus, both partners' surnames coexist with whatever usage name they choose.\n\nThis distinction is important because many official documents use the person's maiden, or legal or true surname, rather than their usage name.\n\nPeople may also choose to use other names in daily usage, as long as they are not impersonating others and as long as their usage name is socially accepted. One example of this is the custom of actors or singers to use a stage name. However, identity documents and other official documents will bear only the \"real name\" of the person.\n\nIn some cases, people change their real name to their stage name; for example, the singer Patrick Bruel changed his name from his birth name of \"Benguigui\". Another example of aliases being turned into true names: During World War II, some Resistance fighters (such as Lucie Aubrac) and Jews fleeing persecution adopted aliases. Some kept the alias as a legal name after the war or added it to their name (Jacques Chaban-Delmas' name was \"Delmas\", and \"Chaban\" was the last of his wartime aliases; his children were given the family surname Delmas).\n\nTruly changing one's last name, as opposed to adopting a usage name, is quite complex. Such changes have to be made official by a \"décret en Conseil d'État\" taken by the Prime Minister after approbation by the Council of State. Requests for such changes must be justified by some legitimate interest, for instance, changing from a foreign name difficult to pronounce in French to a simpler name, or changing from a name with unfavorable connotations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6768468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6768468", "title": "Fritz Moen", "text": "Fritz Moen\n\nFritz Yngvar Moen (17 December 1941 – 28 March 2005) was a Norwegian man wrongfully convicted of two distinct felony murders, serving a total of 18 years in prison. After the convictions were quashed, an official inquiry was instigated to establish what had gone wrong in the authorities' handling of the case, and on 25 June 2007 the commission delivered harsh criticism to the police, the prosecution and the courts in what was immediately termed Norway's worst miscarriage of justice of all time.\n\nMoen was deaf and had a severe speech impediment. He was also partially paralysed, but had normal intelligence and good memory.\n\nMoen was convicted for two separate rapes and murders, both in Trondheim:\n\nThe prosecuting authorities relied on Moen's confession to the murders, which appears to have been coerced by way of intimidation.\n\nBiological samples were collected at both crime scenes and tested with technology available at the time, but the samples were then lost and destroyed for reasons that remain unclear.\n\nWhen Moen was convicted, his defence lawyer, Olav Hestenes, announced: \"For the first time at this desk, I allow myself to say that a travesty of justice has been committed.\"\n\nThe judge, Karl Solberg, reacted furiously and later applauded the court's verdict. Solberg has become notorious for miscarriages of justice, having also been instrumental in the wrongful conviction of Atle Hage, a father who was convicted of incest, took his own life after his release from prison, and was cleared ten years later when his children testified on his behalf.\n\nMoen's lawyer requested a new trial for both cases on 2 January 2000. The court accepted the request for the Sigrid Heggheim case, and on 7 October 2004 judge Wenche Skjæggestad announced that the court had quashed the conviction and acquitted Moen for the rape and attempted murder of Sigrid Heggheim. The court found that the forensic evidence exonerated Moen, and that in any case reasonable doubt should have acquitted him in the first place. Among other things, he had an alibi for the most likely time of the crime. Also, the forensic evidence indicated that the perpetrator had pursued the victim across a field, knocked her down, and then tied her with her own clothes — Moen was partly paralysed and physically incapable of these actions.\n\nThe court rejected the appeal against Moen's conviction in the Torunn Finstad case, and on 13 October 2005, the Norwegian Criminal Cases Review Commission received a preliminary application to review the case. When Moen died on 28 March 2005 of natural causes, it became known that he wanted the case on his behalf to continue.\n\nIn December 2005, it became known that Tor Hepsø, a convicted criminal with a long history of violence, had made a deathbed confession to killing both Sigrid Heggheim and Torunn Finstad. On 15 June 2006, the Criminal Cases Review Commission formally accepted the application, and on 24 August 2006, the Frostating court posthumously acquitted Fritz Moen for the rape and murder of Sigrid Heggheim. It found that the preponderance of evidence made Hepsø a more likely suspect, and that Moen's confession was likely coerced and only included information that had been made public. These two acquittals are widely attributed to the work of Moen's defence lawyer John Christian Elden and private investigator Tore Sandberg.\n\nIn the aftermath of the acquittals, Fritz Moen's lawyers filed a civil suit against the Norwegian government seeking 28 million NOK (€3 million). The case was settled in April 2008 when the presiding judge awarded 20 million NOK. \n\nThe case caused widespread public debate in Norway. There were calls for a formal inquiry into the conduct of the prosecutors and police, and in 2008 the newspaper Aftenposten proposed erecting a bust or statue of Moen in front of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice as a symbol of the responsibilities of the criminal justice system, although there so far has been no sign of this being taken seriously.\n\nOn 25 June 2007 a commission headed by Henry John Mæland, professor of law at the University of Bergen, delivered its findings to the Norwegian Minister of Justice Knut Storberget. The commission stated that the principle of objectivity was violated repeatedly by both the police and the courts. It also found that the most important lesson that could be learned from this case was that the presumption of innocence must be upheld by both the public prosecutors and the courts. Mæland stated that witnesses had been coaxed by the Trondheim police force, while at the same time significant evidence proving Moen's innocence had been withheld from the defence and the courts. \"Some of the evidence has basically been hidden within the police reports,\" Mæland concluded. The justice minister commented during the press conference that \"the commission's report shows that grave errors have been committed leading to grave results.\"\n\nThe commission was appointed on 8 September 2006 by the Norwegian cabinet. Besides Professor Mæland, it consisted of judge Inger Marie Dons Jensen and psychiatrist Ingrid Lycke Ellingsen. Its mandate was to \"find out why Moen was wrongfully convicted and evaluate whether changes are needed in the criminal justice system to avoid wrongful convictions in the future\".\n\nA book called \"Overgrepet\" (Infringement)\",\" by Tore Sandberg, the private investigator involved in Moen's case, was published in October 2007. The book names police officers and other public servants instrumental in Moen's prosecution.\n\nOn 5 February 2008, the Norwegian Parliament's Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs recommended that a commission be appointed to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute for the impeachment of three of the Norwegian Supreme Court justices who presided over the Moen cases. The three were Magnus Matningsdal, Karin Maria Bruzelius and Eilert Stang Lund. However, when the case went to the Standing Committee on Justice, it was closed.\n\n\"Justice:Denied\", the only wrongful conviction magazine in the United States, published an article about Fritz Moen's case in its Spring 2008 issue: \"Exonerated Of Two Murders, Fritz Moen Posthumously Awarded $4 Million\".\n\nThe conclusion of the inquiry recommended there be no investigation to label responsibility to individual police or judicial officers since \"such action would probably lead to the pulverisation of responsibility\".\n\n"}

Garden design is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means \"garden maintenance\". Vita Sackville-West, Gertrude Jekyll and William Robinson were garden designers as well as gardeners.\n\nGarden design is the creation of a plan for the construction of a garden, in a design process. The product is the garden, and the garden designers attempt to optimize the given general conditions of the soil, location and climate, ecological, and geological conditions and processes to choose the right plants in corresponding conditions. The design can include different themes such as perennial, butterfly, wildlife, Japanese, water, tropical, or shade gardens. In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into formal gardens or landscaped park lands, such as at Versailles, France, or Stowe, England. Today, landscape architects and garden designers continue to design both private garden spaces, residential estates and parkland, public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks. Professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers.\n\nThe designer also provides directions and supervision during construction, and the management of establishment and maintenance once the garden has been created. The gardener is the person who has the skill to maintain the garden's design.\n\nThe gardener's labor during the year include planting flowers and other plants, weeding, pruning, grafting, removal of dead flowers, mixing and preparation of insecticides and other products for treating pests, and tending garden compost. Weeds tend to thrive at the expense of the more refined edible or ornamental plants. Gardeners need to control weeds using physical or chemical methods to stop weeds from reaching a mature stage of growth when they could be harmful to domesticated plants. Early activities, such as starting young plants from seeds for later transplantation, are usually performed in early spring.\n"}

He had not designed or manufactured a firearm until he was 52 years old. He was already an expert in polymers as a result of his previous business ventures.\n\nIn 1980 he bought an injection-moulding machine to manufacture handles and sheaths for the field knives he was making for the Austrian army in his garage workshop. His earliest employees were from the camera industry and were experts in producing polymer components. His first pistol took one year to produce from the design and concept stage to production, and he applied for an Austrian patent in April 1981 for the pistol known as the Glock 17.\n\nGlock married Helga Glock in 1958, and they co-founded the family business in 1963. They divorced in 2011 and have been in litigation since.\n\nGlock supports different charities in Austria, having donated over one million euros.\n\nIn July 1999, Glock's tax advisor Charles Ewert hired a French mercenary to murder Glock with a hammer in a car park in an apparent attempt to cover up embezzlement of millions from the Glock company.\nAlthough Glock's injuries included seven head wounds and the loss of about a litre of blood, Glock was able to fend off the attack by striking the hitman twice.

{"id": "511694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511694", "title": "George W. Bush military service controversy", "text": "George W. Bush military service controversy\n\nControversy over George W. Bush's military service in the Air National Guard was an issue that first gained widespread public attention during the 2004 presidential campaign. The controversy centered on Texas Air National Guard, why he lost his flight status, and whether he fulfilled the requirements of his military service contract.\n\nGeorge W. Bush joined the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group of the Texas Air National Guard on May 27, 1968, during the Vietnam War. He committed to serve until May 26, 1974, with two years on active duty while training to fly and four years on part-time duty. In his 1968 Statement of Intent (undated), he wrote, \"I have applied for pilot training with the goal of making flying a lifetime pursuit and I believe I can best accomplish this to my own satisfaction by serving as a member of the Air National Guard as long as possible.\"\n\nFollowing his six weeks of basic training, Bush began 54 weeks of flight training at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. In December 1969, Bush began 21 weeks of fighter interceptor training on the F-102 in Houston at the 147th's Combat Crew Training School, soloing in March 1970 and graduating in June 1970. When he graduated, he had fulfilled his two-year active-duty commitment.\n\nIn November 1970, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, commander of the 111th Fighter Squadron, recommended that Bush be promoted to First Lieutenant, calling him \"a dynamic outstanding young officer\" who stood out as \"a top notch fighter interceptor pilot.\" He said that \"Lt. Bush's skills far exceed his contemporaries,\" and that \"he is a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership. Lt. Bush is also a good follower with outstanding disciplinary traits and an impeccable military bearing.\" Bush was promoted.\n\nAir National Guard members could volunteer for active duty service with the Air Force in a program called Palace Alert, which deployed F-102 pilots to Europe and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand. According to three pilots from Bush's squadron, Bush inquired about this program but was advised by the base commander that he did not have the necessary flying experience (500 hours) at the time and that the F-102 would soon be retired.\n\nBush's four-year part-time obligation to serve required him to maintain his immediate readiness to be recalled to active duty in the event of a national emergency. Bush performed part-time Guard duty as an F-102 pilot through April 1972, logging a total of 336 flight hours.\n\nPrior to April 1972, Bush had fulfilled more than the required hours of service, but with more than two years remaining before his discharge. He volunteered his services on several projects, including a political campaign. After April 1972, Bush may have failed to meet the attendance requirements established for members of the Air National Guard. In mid-1972, he failed to meet the Air Force requirement for an annual physical examination for pilots, and lost his authorization to be a pilot. According to Bush's pay records, he did not attend any drills between mid-April and the end of October 1972. He drilled in Alabama in October and November 1972, and again in January 1973; what duties he performed are unknown. Bush returned to his home unit in Houston and was paid for his service in April 1973 through July 1973; again, what duties he performed are not documented in any way.\n\nOn October 1, 1973, Bush was honorably discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to the Air Force Reserve's inactive reserves in Denver, Colorado. He was discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974, ending his military service.\n\nDuring the 1968–1974 period, Presidents Johnson and Nixon decided against calling up National Guard units for service in Vietnam. However, military documents show during the Vietnam War, almost 23,000 Army and Air Guardsmen were called up for a year of active duty; some 8,700 were deployed to Vietnam.\n\nIn 1999, Ben Barnes, former Democratic Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives and Lieutenant Governor of Texas, gave testimony in a deposition for a lawsuit related to the Texas lottery; and following the deposition, his lawyer issued a statement to the press. According to the statement, Barnes had called the head of the Texas Air National Guard, Brigadier General James Rose, to recommend Bush for a pilot spot at the request of Bush family friend Sidney Adger. The statement also said, \"Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush family asked Barnes' help. Barnes has no knowledge that Governor Bush or President Bush knew of Barnes' recommendation.\" While working as an active fundraiser for John Kerry, Bush's opponent during the 2004 U.S. Presidential campaign, Barnes repeated that he used his political influence to preferentially refer people to the National Guard, including Bush.\n\nBoth George W. Bush and his father have stated that they did not ask Adger to intercede and were unaware of any action he may have taken. Walter Staudt, the colonel in command of Bush's squadron, has stated that he accepted Bush's application without receiving any outside pressure to do so.\n\nIn applying for pilot training, Bush took a standardized test on which he had a low score, in the 25th percentile. In addition, Bush had two arrests for college pranks and four traffic offenses before applying for pilot training. In 2004, former and current military pilots said it was uncommon for an applicant to be accepted into pilot school with such a record, though there was no specific score that disqualified a candidate.\n\nFlight logs released in September 2004 in response to a lawsuit (see below) showed that Bush, who had been flying in the F-102A Delta Dagger, a single-seater interceptor, for most of his career, flew nine times in T-33 trainers in February and March 1972 – nearly twice as many times as he had flown in T-33s in the prior 18 months. The logs also show that on March 12 and April 10 of 1972, Bush took two passes to land his F-102 fighter. Although White House officials could not explain the changes in the flight logs in these final flights, Air Force experts said there could be any of a number of reasons for the change in Bush's flight pattern. Retired Major General Paul A. Weaver, a former head of the Air National Guard, said Bush could have just been practicing landing skills. \"It doesn't mean anything to have multiple approaches,\" Weaver said.\n\nThe final two entries of Bush's official flight logs show him being assigned to work as an instructional pilot in late May 1972 at a Texas Air National Guard base, although he had left for Alabama in mid-May (see below) and his pay records show he was not paid for any work on the two dates of the instructional pilot assignment. Coding on the logs showed these assignments were subsequently deleted from the official record.\n\nBy regulation, all Air Force pilots were required to take and pass an annual physical in order to remain in flight status, in the three months prior to a pilot's birthday (in Bush's case, July 6). Bush did not take this mandatory physical examination in mid-1972. As a result of his failure to take his physical, his flight status was suspended by his commander on August 1, 1972, confirmed by Col Bobby Hodges on September 5, 1972, and confirmed again by a National Guard Bureau order on September 29, 1972, which meant he no longer was authorized to fly as a pilot.\n\nAir National Guard regulations require that \"the local commander who has authority to convene a Flying Evaluation Board will direct an investigation as to why the individual failed to accomplish the medical examination.\" But there are no records of an investigation or of any requests to complete one.\n\nAlthough the previous two physicals that Bush had taken were done by flight surgeons, Bush said in 2000 that he wanted to wait to take the physical until it could be done by his own private doctor. But regulations require that the physical be performed by an Air Force doctor. Air Force flight surgeons were assigned to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, located across town from Maxwell AFB at the Dannelly Field Air National Guard Base at Dannelly Field airport, where Bush was paid for drilling in October and November 1972 and in January 1973, his only drilling dates between April 1972 and April 1973.\n\nAccording to his released military records, after April 1972 Bush never flew again as an Air National Guard pilot.\n\nDuring 2004, Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe and others accused Bush of being absent without leave (AWOL) from the Air National Guard in 1972–73. White House communications director Dan Bartlett and others, who called the charge election-year propaganda, noted that Bush was honorably discharged and that no AWOL charge had ever been made against Bush by the National Guard.\n\nReleased military records show that Bush's documented service record through mid-April 1972 (Bush drilled on the 15th and 16th of that month) was without gaps; the period in question is from May 1972 forward.\n\nOn May 24, 1972, Bush submitted a form requesting a transfer to the 9921st Air Reserve Squadron in Montgomery, Alabama, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Reese R. Bricken. According to the request form, Bush was already in Alabama at work on the Senate campaign of Winton M. Blount, who was a friend of his father. Jimmy Allison, a longtime family friend, helped Bush get the campaign work.\n\nOn May 26, Bricken approved Bush’s application for transfer. Bricken wrote: \"You already understand that this is a Training Category G, Pay Group None, Reserve Section MM proposition.\" As an obligated Reservist, Bush was in Training Category \"fA\", which required a minimum of 48 periods of inactive duty training, and 15 days of active duty training, and was required to remain in that Training Category. Training Category \"G\" offered no training at all. According to Air Force regulations (AFM 35-3, paragraph 14-6), being in \"Training Category A\" meant that \"If a member...will be unable to further train with his unit because of an impending change of residence...he is required to sign a statement that he has been counseled.\" That counseling included notifying Bush of his obligation to find a new unit with which he could fulfill his training obligations.\n\nOn July 31, the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) rejected Bush's transfer request, saying that he could not be reassigned to an Air Reserve Squadron because of his obligated service. Bricken, asked about the matter in 2000, said that Bush made no effort to participate as a Guardsman with the 9921st.\n\nBush remained obligated to train with his Texas unit, or to perform substitute training elsewhere each month. On September 5, 1972, he requested permission to \"perform equivalent duty\" at the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group in Alabama \"for the months of September, October, and November.\" He did not receive approval to do so, though his commanding officer recommended he be granted permission. He would have reported to Lieutenant Colonel William Turnipseed, the base commander, for drills on October 7 and 8, and November 4 and 5 (the September drill dates of the unit had already passed). Bush's grandfather, former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, died of cancer on October 8, and Bush served as a pallbearer at the funeral in Greenwich, Connecticut. Turnipseed has said that he could not recall whether Bush reported on those occasions.\n\nIn 2004, John \"Bill\" Calhoun, a former Alabama Air National Guard officer who had served at the Dannelly Field Air National Guard Base in Montgomery, home of the 187th, said he had seen Bush report for duty \"at least six times\" in the spring and summer of 1972, a period he had not even applied for, and that Bush had in fact spent time in his office. However, the payment and retirement records the White House handed out three days prior to Calhoun's claims show that Bush received no pay or attendance credits during that May to October period.\n\nThe U.S. Senate campaign in Alabama, on which Bush worked, ended on November 7, 1972, when Blount lost overwhelmingly. Released military records show that Bush was paid for service for the days of October 28–29 and November 11–14, 1973, and for January 4–6 and 8–10, 1973, and that he received a dental examination at Dannelly on January 6. All of those dates are outside of the period that was claimed for Bush's service in Alabama. \n\nA 2006 column in the \"Birmingham News\" (Alabama) reported about people who remembered Bush when he was in Alabama, working for the Blount campaign: \"None have specific recollections about Bush and the National Guard. Some heard he was serving but never saw for themselves.\" Opinions of him during his time working on the campaign ranged from good (amiable, well liked, and fond of sports) to bad (bragging about drinking and allegations he trashed a cottage where he was living). Winton Blount's son Tom said \"He was an attractive person, kind of a 'frat boy.' I didn't like him.\"\n\nIn 1972 and 1973, Bush dated Mavanee Bear, another member of Blount's campaign staff. Bear said in 2009 that \"I know [Bush] served\" while in Alabama because he had to regularly reschedule meetings, but also said \"I didn't see him in uniform.\" When later back in Texas, she said she frequently saw him in uniform, stating \"I think he was mostly just flying in circles over Houston.\"\n\nIn a document dated May 2, 1973, Bush's immediate superiors gave him his annual performance review for the period from May 1, 1972, to April 30, 1973. The review stated that \"Lt. Bush has not been observed at this unit during the period of the report.\" Lt. Col. William D. Harris Jr. and Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian also wrote, \"A civilian occupation made it necessary for him to move to Montgomery, Ala. He cleared this base on May 15, 1972 and has been performing equivalent training in a non-flying status with the 187 Tac Recon Gp. Dannelly ANG Base, Alabama.\"\n\nBack in Houston, in late 1972 or early 1973, Bush did unpaid volunteer work for a number of months with an inner-city poverty program, Project P.U.L.L. (Professional United Leadership League), the brainchild of John White, a former professional football player and civic leader.\n\nBush was paid for drilling on April 7–8, 1973. That service presumably occurred at his home base, Ellington Air Force Base, in Houston, in contradiction to the information in his performance review. For May 1973, Bush was paid for service on fifteen days: 1–3, 8–11, 19–20, 22–24, and 29-31. For June, he was paid for five days; for July (his last month of drilling) for 19 days. However there is nothing in the released military documents that shows that he actually reported for duty on those days, or exactly where, or what duties he performed. As of the end of July 1973, Bush had been in the Air National Guard for a little over five years.\n\nOn May 27, 1968, Bush signed a six-year obligation. That required him to complete \"48 scheduled inactive-duty training periods\" each fiscal year (typically consisting of four four-hour periods during one weekend each month), plus a minimum of 15 days of Annual Active Duty Training. For Bush, as a pilot, this was typically split into periods of duty of a few days each during the year.\n\nThe \"Boston Globe\" reported in September 2004 that \"Bush fell well short of meeting his military obligation\", citing examples of Bush failing to meet Air National Guard commitments in 1972 and 1973. Bush's military records show that he was credited for attending Air National Guard drills during 1972 and 1973, but the time frame of these drills (see above) still left questions.\n\nOn July 30, 1973, his last day of paid service in the Texas Air National Guard, Bush signed a statement that \"I have been counseled this date regarding my plans to leave my present Reserve of [sic] assignment due to moving from this area. I understand that: a. If I disassociate from my current Ready Reserve Assignment, it is my responsibility to locate and be assigned to another Reserve Forces unit or mobilization augmentation position. If I fail to do so, I am subject to involuntary order to active duty for up to 24 months under the provisions of AFM 35-3, chapter 14.\"\n\nOn September 5, 1973, Bush requested discharge from Texas Air National Guard service, to be effective on October 1. He wrote, \"I am moving to Boston, Massachusetts to attend Harvard Business School as a full time student.\" Jerry Killian recommended approval of the discharge the following day. Bush had completed five years, four months, and five days toward his six-year service obligation.\n\nOn October 1, 1973, Bush was honorably discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to the Air Force Reserve's inactive reserves in Denver, Colorado. On November 21, 1974, he was discharged from the Air Force Reserve, ending his military service.\n\nIn September 2004, Lawrence Korb, an Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan, after reviewing the payroll records for Bush's last two years of service, concluded that they indicated that Bush did not fulfill his obligations and could have been ordered to active duty as a result.\n\nDuring the 2000 presidential campaign, various military records of Bush were made public by the Bush campaign.\n\nOn February 13, 2004, during Bush's re-election campaign, more than 700 additional pages of documents on Bush's service were released, including those from the National Personnel Records Center, under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. This release was claimed by some to contradict the statement that Bush made on February 8, 2004 to \"Meet the Press\" interviewer Tim Russert, that \"We did [authorize the release of everything] in 2000, by the way.\" In response, Bush contended that he was referring only to documents already in his possession, as opposed to the newly released documents from military sources.\n\nOn June 22, 2004, The Associated Press sued the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force, seeking access to all of Bush's records during his military service.\n\nOn July 8, 2004, the Pentagon reported that the microfilmed payroll records of Bush and numerous other service members had been inadvertently ruined in 1996 and 1997 by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service during a project to salvage deteriorating microfilm. The records lost included those covering July through September 1972, when Bush's claims of service in Alabama were in question, and the Pentagon reported that no paper backups could be found.\n\nOn July 23, 2004, the Pentagon reported that the records it had previously reported destroyed had been found. A Pentagon official said the earlier statement that the records were destroyed was an \"inadvertent oversight.\" The Pentagon released computerized payroll records covering Bush's 1972 service. Like the records released earlier by the White House, the newly released documents did not indicate that Bush performed any drills, in Alabama or elsewhere, during May through September 1972.\n\nOn September 7, 2004, the White House released the flight logs recording the flights done by Bush as a pilot. A Pentagon spokeswoman said the logs were found at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, which is the central repository for veterans' records. She said the logs were found among a batch of records sent to St. Louis from Norton Air Force Base in 1993, which were originally thought to contain records of active-duty officers rather than of National Guardsmen such as Bush.\n\nOn September 24, 2004, under court order resulting from an earlier FOIA lawsuit filed by the Associated Press, the Pentagon released more documents.\n\nOn September 29, 2004, the White House released a November 1974 document, saying it had been in Bush's personnel file and that it had been found by the Pentagon.\n\nOn October 5, 2004, more than a week after a court-imposed deadline to turn over all records of Bush's military service, the Texas Air National Guard produced two previously unreleased documents (four pages of records) that included Bush's orders for his last day of active duty in 1973.\n\nOn October 14, 2004, two weeks after Texas National Guard officials signed an oath swearing they had turned over all records, the Texas National Guard released 31 additional pages of documents found by two retired Army lawyers who went through Guard files under an agreement between the Texas National Guard and The Associated Press, which sued to gain access to the files. A Guard spokesman defended the continuing discoveries, saying Guard officials did not find all of Bush’s records because they were disorganized and in poor shape. \"These boxes are full of dirt and rat [excrement] and dead bugs. They have never been sitting in an uncontrolled climate,\" said Lt. Col. John Stanford. \"It’s a tough task to go through archives that were not set up in a way that you could easily go through them.\"\n\nThe \"Killian documents\" were initially claimed by CBS to have come from the \"personal files\" of the late Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, Bush's squadron commander during Bush's Air National Guard service. They describe preferential treatment during Bush's service, including pressure on Killian to \"sugar coat\" an annual officer rating report for the then 1st Lt. Bush. CBS aired the story on September 8, 2004, amid more releases of Bush's official records by the Department of Defense, including one just the day before as the result of a FOIA lawsuit by the Associated Press.\n\nThe Killian documents are widely considered to be fake. Starting with a Free Republic web posting by Harry MacDougald, a conservative Republican lawyer posting under the blogger name, \"Buckhead.\" MacDougald and multiple fellow bloggers claimed that the formatting shown in the documents used proportional fonts that did not come into common use until the mid-to-late 1990s and alleged that the documents were therefore likely forgeries. While the widely publicized rationale of \"Buckhead\" was technically inaccurate, both related and unrelated serious challenges to the authenticity of the documents nonetheless exist. For instance, it is unlikely that the typewriters available to Killian's secretary could have produced such a document, and the documents contained U.S. Army, rather than U.S. Air Force, jargon.\n\nThe forgery allegations subsequently came to the attention of the mainstream media, especially after experts also questioned the documents' authenticity and lack of a chain of custody. The original documents have never been submitted for authentication. The man who delivered the copies, Lt. Col. Bill Burkett, a former officer in the Texas Army National Guard and outspoken Bush critic, claimed that he burned the originals. Burkett admitted lying to CBS and \"USA Today\" about where he had obtained the papers and eventually expressed doubts of his own about their authenticity.\n\nCBS and Dan Rather initially defended the documents and the report, but on September 20, 2004 – less than two months before Election Day, CBS News stated that it had been \"misled\" and that it could not authenticate the documents and should not have used them. A later \"60 Minutes\" broadcast an interview with Marian Carr Knox, secretary to Killian at the time, who stated that she \"didn't type these memos\", although she stated she had typed memos of similar content. CBS then formed an independent panel headed by former U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and retired Associated Press president Louis D. Boccardi to investigate the story and the handling of the Killian memos. The final report of the panel, while not addressing the authenticity of the documents, faulted many of the decisions made in developing the story, and producer Mary Mapes along with three others were forced to resign from CBS News.\n\nPrior to the panel report being completed, Rather announced the date of his retirement, left \"60 Minutes Wednesday\", stepped down as anchor on March 9, 2006, and then left CBS altogether on June 20, 2006. The CBS news show that had aired the memos, \"60 Minutes Wednesday\", was canceled on May 18, 2005, allegedly due to poor ratings and not because of the memos broadcast.\n\nIn September 2007, Rather sued CBS and its former parent company, Viacom, for US$70 million, claiming that he had been made a \"scapegoat\" over the memos story. His legal fight with CBS ended in January 2010 when the New York State Supreme Court declined to hear his motion to reinstate his lawsuit.\n\n\n"}

This he pursued at the University of the Philippines where he topped his class. Even as a student, he was already immersed in intricate operations of finance and expense, of capital and production, and of management labor handling. He became an active member of the business-oriented Pan Xenia Fraternity. He was also later inducted into Upsilon Sigma Phi as an honorary member.\n\nHe became a member of the Rotary Club of Manila at about the same time that he was also a young professor of economics at the University of the Philippines. Puyat's skill in managing the family business caught the eye of the late President Manuel L. Quezon. At the time, the country was predominantly agricultural in activity and the President was advocating industrialization. Quezon named the young Puyat as dean of the College of Business Administration at the University of the Philippines when he was 33, becoming the youngest dean the UP ever had. An active member of international trades bodies, he acquired international stature in business. The Business Writers’ Association of the Philippines voted him \"Business Leader of the Year\" in 1948 and the Association of Red Feather Agencies voted him \"Civic Leader of the Year\" in 1949. \n\nIn 1953, he received a plaque from the Community Chest of Greater Manila for “ outstanding services as one of the founders, first president and first campaign fund chairman “ of the body. The Philippine Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO) awarded him a certificate of honor for demonstrating national leadership in business, economics, the civic and political fields and for his distinguished service to the youth. \n\nIn the Philippine midterm elections of 1951, he was elected Senator and he served in the Philippine Senate until its closure by Martial Law in 1972. From 1967 he was the Senate President.\n\nAs a legislator, Puyat created a sensation unmarked in political history by his reforms and innovations involving the dispensation of the controversial public works funds.\n\nHe is founder of Manila Banking Corporation (now Chinabank Savings Bank), Manila Bankers Life Insurance Corporation and the Loyola Group of Companies. The Loyola Group of Companies is composed of Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc., Group Developers Inc. and Loyola Memorial Chapels and Crematorium Inc.\n\nHe founded Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc. in 1968 and today it is the oldest Pre-need Company in continuous operation. Group Developers pioneered the concept of memorial parks in the Philippines with its two signature memorial parks in Marikina and Sucat. Loyola Memorial Chapels was the first to use modern cremation technology in the Philippines. Loyola Memorial Chapels has six branches: Commonwealth Avenue Quezon City, 20th Avenue Cubao Quezon City, Marikina, Guadalupe Makati City, Sucat Rd Paranaque City and Los Banos Laguna.\n\nPuyat is the third child of Philippine Pioneer Industrialist Gonzalo Puyat and Nicasia Juco. He was trained early in life by his father, Don Gonzalo, in the trade of manufacturing billiard tables and bowling alleys. Eventually, he assisted in managing the family business of Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, the brand holder of AMF-Puyat, Puyat Steel, and Puyat Vinyl.\n\nPuyat was married to Eugenia Guidote, an accountant and pioneer member of the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants (PICPA), and a trained opera singer (soprano). They had seven children – Gil, Jr. (deceased), Vicente (deceased), Antonio, Victor, Jesusa, Alfonso and Eugenia\n\nIn 1978, he was invested as a member of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. He died, 3 years later, on March 22, 1981 due to cardiac arrest, one of the complications of an asthma attack. He was buried on March 28, 1981 at Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina.\n\nBuendia Avenue, which was formerly named after the Commonwealth Era senator and Aglipayano Nicolas Buendia, is now named after him, but most people tend to use the original name of the road.\n\n"}

{"id": "311102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311102", "title": "Jane Roberts", "text": "Jane Roberts\n\nDorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 – September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, self-proclaimed psychic, and spirit medium, who claimed to channel an energy personality who called himself \"Seth.\" Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the \"Seth Material\", established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena. The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled \"Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090)\", which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations.\n\nRoberts was born in a hospital in Albany, New York and grew up in nearby Saratoga Springs, New York. Her parents, Delmer Hubbell Roberts and Marie Burdo, divorced when she was two years old. With her only child, the young Marie then returned to her own parents, and the home that the family had rented for a number of years: half of a double dwelling in a poor neighborhood in Saratoga Springs. Marie had begun experiencing the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis by 1932, but worked as much as possible. Eventually Roberts' grandfather, Joseph Burdo, with whom she shared a deep mystical identification, was unable to support two extra people, and the family had to rely upon public assistance. Roberts' grandmother was killed in an automobile accident in 1936.\n\nThe next year, her grandfather moved out of the house. By then Marie was partially incapacitated, and the Welfare Department began to furnish mother and daughter with occasional (and often unreliable) domestic help. When Marie became a bedridden invalid, it was Jane’s responsibility to take care of her. This included cooking, cleaning, bringing her the bedpan, and getting up in the middle of the night to refuel the stove. Her embittered mother used to tell Jane that she was going to turn on the gas jets in the middle of the night and kill them both. \"My mother was a real bitch,\" Jane said, \"but she was an energetic bitch. When my mother attempted suicide for about the fifth time, she took a whole mess of sleeping pills and was in the hospital. I went to the welfare lady and said, 'I can’t take it anymore. I’ve just got to leave.'\" Over and over Marie told Jane that she was no good, that the daughter's birth had caused the mother's illness, and that she was disowned and considered no longer her daughter.\n\nThe persistent psychological abuse and mistreatment by her mother resulted in the young girl's deep fear of abandonment. Such situations increased Jane's sense of not being safe, yet also reinforced feelings of independence, for she did not have to feel as dependent upon Marie as she might otherwise. Well before she was 10 years old Jane had developed persistent symptoms of colitis. By her early teens she had an overactive thyroid gland. Her vision was poor; she required very strong glasses (which she seldom wore). For most of 1940 and half of 1941 Jane was in a strictly-run Catholic orphanage in Troy, NY while her mother was hospitalized in another city for treatment of her arthritis. Priests came to the house regularly and support was offered to the fatherless family. Jane's initial bonding to the cultural beliefs of religion was very strong to make up for the lack of a loving, nurturing family.\n\nThe 'troublesome' material remained relatively inactive until her curiosity and ability led her to actively challenge those ideas, while she was also in a situation where the natural fear of abandonment might be suggested, thus clouding her perception of her own reality. This type of limiting psychological suggestion might have resulted from coercive and unintentionally abusive societal interaction perpetuated by the unenlightened and egotistical behavior of individuals around her, which she would later help to unveil, at great length, through the persona of \"Seth\".\n\nFor a time she was left between belief systems. In the summer of 1945, when she was 16 years old, Jane began working at a variety store. It was her first job. That fall she continued on the job after school hours and on an occasional Saturday. After attending public schools she went to Skidmore College from 1947 to 1950 on a poetry scholarship. Roberts' grandfather died when she was age 19. It was a time of severe shock for her. She began to substitute scientific world view for religious belief.\n\nAt that time Jane was dating a man called Walt Zeh, a long-time Saratoga Springs friend. Together they went to the west coast by motorcycle to see Jane’s father who had also come from a broken home. Jane then married Walt and continued to write while taking a variety of other jobs, including society editor for the Saratoga newspaper, and as a supervisor in a radio factory. Walt and Jane lived together for three years. It was then in February 1954 while “cutting up, dancing, and raisin' hell at a party,” that Jane first met the former commercial artist Robert Fabian Butts, Jr. (June 20, 1919 - May 26, 2008). The bachelor had shown up at the shindig on a last-minute impulse. The fourth time they met at another party and, never having dated, Jane 'just looked at him and said, \"Look, I’m leaving Walt, and I'm going to live by myself or I'm going to live with you, so just let me know.\"'\" Eventually the two left town together and Jane filed for divorce. Jane and Rob married on December 27, 1954 at the home of his parents in Sayre, PA.\n\nRoberts wrote in a variety of genres: poetry, short stories, children’s literature, nonfiction, science fiction and fantasy, and novels. She was the only woman invited to the first science-fiction writer's conference in 1956 in Milford, PA. The couple moved to Elmira, NY, in 1960, to find steady part-time work – Rob in the local greeting card company, Jane in an art gallery. Their lives seemed set, their art defined. Now in her 30s, she and her husband began to record what she said were messages from a personality named \"Seth,\" and she wrote several books about the experience.\n\nOn a September evening in 1963, their everyday worldview changed. Roberts sat down at her table to work on poetry; Butts was in his back-room studio, painting. \"It was very domestic, very normal, very unpsychedelic,\" she would later remember. And then \"Between one normal minute and the next, a fantastic avalanche of radical, new ideas burst into my head with tremendous force ... It was as if the physical world were really tissue-paper-thin, hiding infinite dimensions of reality, and I was flung through the tissue paper with a huge ripping sound.\" When she \"came to,\" Roberts found herself scrawling the title of this odd batch of notes: \"The Physical Universe as Idea Construction.\" Before this, she had never had any interest in psychic phenomena, and though her fiction typically dealt with such themes as clairvoyance and reincarnation, intellectually neither she nor Butts believed in extrasensory abilities or that anyone survived death once, let alone many times. Yet soon after this episode, Roberts suddenly began recalling her dreams, including two that were inarguably precognitive, the first, as far as she knew, that she'd ever had. Their curiosity piqued, the couple decided to investigate further, and she managed to land a contract with a New York publisher for a do-it-yourself book on extra-sensory perception.\n\nIn late 1963, Roberts and Butts started experimenting with a Ouija board as part of Roberts' research for the book. According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963 they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality who eventually identified himself as Seth. Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head. The first seven sessions were entirely with the Ouija board. The three-hour session on the evening of Jan. 2, 1964 was the first where she began to dictate the messages instead of using the Ouija board. For a while she still opened her sessions with the board, but finally was able to abandon it after the 27th session on Feb. 19, 1964.\n\nRoberts described the process of writing the \"Seth\" books as entering a trance state. She said Seth would assume control of her body and speak through her, while her husband wrote down the words she spoke. They referred to such episodes as \"readings\" or \"sessions.\" The 26th session on Feb. 18, 1964 was the first held in the presence of another person—a friend.\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1964, Roberts channeled an allegedly recently deceased woman who told Butts that his and his wife's work with Seth was a life-time project, that they would publish his manuscripts, and help spread his ideas. At the 27th session Seth also told the couple how to rearrange the furniture in their apartment which would better suit their energies. Despite feelings of disbelief toward both messages, the couple somewhat reluctantly agreed. Two days afterwards they heard from a psychologist interested in reincarnation to whom they had written three weeks earlier with some session copies enclosed. The psychologist told them that the very fluency of the material suggested that it might come from Roberts' subconscious, though it was impossible to tell. He also cautioned that in some circumstances, amateur mediumship could lead to mental problems.\n\n\"The letter upset me considerably, yet it also objectified some of my own doubts. They were out in the air where I could at least deal with them. As far as we could tell, for all of my stewing and hemming and hawing, there were no alarming changes in my personality. I was doing twice the creative work I had done earlier. I was satisfied with the quality of the Seth Material; it was far superior to anything I could do on my own. If nothing else, I thought the sessions presented a way of making deeply unconscious knowledge available on a consistent basis.\"\n\n\"Because we were so innocent about psychic literature, we weren't hampered by superstitious fears about such [psychic] phenomena. I didn't believe in gods or demons, so I didn't fear them. I wanted to learn. Rob and I had discovered a whole new world together, and we were going to explore it.\n\n\"There was a constant battle, though, as some of our results ran full tilt into my intellectual ideas. In the beginning, I took it for granted that Seth was a subconscious fantasy, personified, because I simply couldn't accept the possibility of \"spirits\" or, for that matter, life after death. Then, after it became obvious that the Seth sessions were going to continue, we kept constant check on my personality characteristics and went to a psychologist – as any sane, red-blooded American would do under such circumstances in those days. Seth seemed far more mature and well-balanced than the psychologist, so finally I stopped worrying. Besides, my personality showed no adverse signs of instability. If anything, I was more competent in handling physical affairs. This is not to say the experience did not cause certain strains and stresses that could accompany any worthwhile venture in an entirely new field.\"\n\nRoberts also purportedly channeled the world views of several other people, including the philosopher William James, Rembrandt, and the Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne, through a process she described as using a typewriter to write \"automatically.\"\n\nFor 21 years until Roberts' death in 1984 (with a one-year hiatus due to her final illness), Roberts held more than 1500 regular or private \"ESP class\" trance sessions in which she spoke on behalf of Seth. Butts served as stenographer, taking the messages down in home-made shorthand, and having others on occasion make recording of some sessions. The messages from Seth channeled through Roberts consisted mostly of monologues on a wide variety of topics. They were published by Prentice-Hall under the collective title \"Seth Material\".\n\nOver the years, hundreds of people witnessed Seth speaking. Some went to the ESP classes Roberts held (Tuesday and some Thursday nights, Sept. 1967 – Feb. 1975) for an evening, others attended for longer periods. (By this time Jane had given up her gallery work, and was teaching nursery school during part of this time.) Outside of the ESP class structure, Roberts gave many personal Seth sessions to various individuals who had written her, asking for help. She never charged for those sessions; however, at some point she did charge $2.50 to $3.50 per ESP class of 5 to 40 people. When the books began to sell in sufficient numbers, she dropped that fee. Book sessions were almost always private, held on Monday and Wednesday evenings without witnesses from 1967 through 1982 (except for Tues and Thurs from Aug. to Nov. 1981).\n\nThe material through 1969 was published in summary form in \"The Seth Material\", written by Roberts from the output of the channeling sessions. Beginning in January 1970, Roberts wrote books which she described as dictated by Seth. Roberts claimed no authorship of these books beyond her role as medium. This series of \"Seth books\" totaled ten volumes. The last two books appear to be incomplete due to Roberts' illness. Butts contributed extensive footnotes, appendices, and other comments to all the Seth books, and thus was a co-author on all of them. These additions describe what was going on in Roberts' and his life at the time of the various sessions, annotated some of Seth's comments in light of contemporary beliefs and materials that Roberts and Butts were reading, described excerpts from some fan mail and letters from professionals commenting on Seth's material about their fields, and, especially later, provided insight as to the many steps of production of multiple books with the publisher. By February 1982 they were still receiving \"from 30 to 50 letters and packages a week\" from readers of their various books. Some of Roberts' earlier and later poetry was occasionally included to show how she had touched upon some of Seth's concepts. Roberts also wrote \"The Oversoul Seven\" trilogy to explore via fiction some of Seth's teachings on the concepts of reincarnation and oversouls.\n\nAccording to Roberts, Seth described himself as an \"energy personality essence no longer focused in physical matter,\" and was independent of Roberts' subconscious. Roberts initially expressed skepticism as to Seth's origins, wondering if he was a part of her own personality. As Seth, Roberts at times appeared stern, jovial or professorial. \"His\" voice was deeper and more masculine sounding than Jane's and was possessed of a distinct, although not identifiable, accent. Unlike the psychic Edgar Cayce, whose syntax when speaking in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts' syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth. Later books continued to develop but did not contradict the material introduced in earlier works. Some \"Practice Elements\" were even given so that the readers could see how a few of the concepts could be practically experienced.\n\nA few contemporary world events were commented upon by Seth, such as the Jonestown Guyana deaths and the Three Mile Island accident.\n\nSeth also provided an alternative creation myth to that of either the Big Bang or Intelligent Design.\n\nRoberts' father died in November 1971 at the age of 68; her mother died six months later at the same age. In early 1982 Roberts spent a month in the hospital for severely underactive thyroid gland, protruding eyes and double vision, an almost total hearing loss, a slight anemia, budding bedsores—and a hospital-caused staph infection. She recovered to an extent, but died two and a half years later in 1984, having been bedridden with severe arthritis—like her mother—for the final year and a half of her life. Roberts had spent 504 consecutive days in a hospital in Elmira, N.Y. The immediate causes of her death were a combination of protein depletion, osteomyelitis, and soft-tissue infections. These conditions arose out of her long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. (Butts believed for some 15 years that in Roberts' case, at least, the young girl's psychological conditioning was far more important—far more damaging, in those terms—than any physical tendency to inherit the disease.) Roberts was cremated the next day, in a process she and Butts had agreed upon several years earlier. After Roberts’ death, lovingly recorded in \"The Way Toward Health\" (1997), Butts continued his work as a guardian of the Seth texts and continued to supervise the publication of some of the remaining material, including \"The Early Sessions,\" and making sure that all of the recordings, manuscripts, notes, and drawings related to the extraordinary encounters with Seth would be given to the Yale Library. Butts remarried, and his second wife, Laurel Lee Davies, supported his work during the more than twenty years that they were together. (Davies had moved to Elmira from California in 1985 at Butts' request to help answer mail and proofread manuscripts. They did not actually marry until 1999.) Butts died of cancer on May 26, 2008. Jane Roberts Butts and Robert F. Butts Jr. are interred together in the Wayne County, NY, Furnaceville cemetery; however, there is another gravestone with their names on it in the Sunnyside cemetery in Tunkhannock, PA. The vitality of the teachings they helped to bring to the world continues. A number of groups have compiled anthologies of quotes from Seth, summarized sections of his teachings, issued copies of Seth sessions on audio tape, and further relayed the material via classes and conventions.\n\nSeth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound. The title jacket of \"The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book,\" published in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library), contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, Dan Millman, Louise Hay, Richard Bach, and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening. In words similar to Williamson's they state: \"Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life.\" Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the University of Chicago, stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material \"launched an era of nationwide awareness\" of the channeling trend. She believes it contributed to the \"self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks.\"\n\nJohn P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that, for each individual: \"you create your own reality.\" (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions which trigger our memories and organize our associations. Eventually those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the \"Seth Material.\" Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at Bradley University, wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called \"unchurched American spirituality,\" related to concepts of reincarnation, \"karma\", free will, ancient metaphysical wisdom, and \"Christ consciousness.\"\n\nSome writers noted, \"Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East… and we've done a little reading on Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, and Taoism, for example, not to mention subjects like shamanism, voodooism, and obeah.\"\n\nThe late amateur physicist Michael Talbot wrote, \"To my great surprise—and slight annoyance—I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both paranormal phenomena and quantum physics.\"\n\nRoberts and the \"Seth Material\" have attracted critiques from outside the paranormal community. The poet Charles Upton, in his collection of essays titled \"The System of Antichrist\", posited that Roberts multiplied the self due to a fear of death. His opinion was that the Seth texts are based on a misunderstanding of both Christianity and of Eastern religions.\n\nProfessor of psychology and noted critic of parapsychology James E. Alcock opined, \"In light of all this, the Seth materials must surely be viewed as less than ordinary. There certainly was the time and talent for fraud to play a role, but we cannot discriminate between that possibility and the possibility of unconscious production—at any rate, given these circumstances, there seems little need to consider the involvement of any supernatural agency.\"\n\nSeth's teaching of a philosophy far more detailed than and not in keeping with traditional Church-authority, God-separate-from Creation, one-mortal-life, Jesus-centered messages has also received its share of criticism from some Christian believers. Various ministries have warned their members about the dangers and deceptions of reading channeled messages from Roberts and others. \"The Seth Material\" has been considered in certain circles to be \"a book entirely written by a demon. A woman simply wrote it down as it was dictated to her by the demon; and, of course, it just destroys everything that is true in terms of God's revelation,\" and as evidence for \"Devil possession.\" Videos such as \"Jane Roberts' Seth Speaks is Anti-Catholic Hate Books – Allowed By The Media\" protested that Seth was \"a demon from hell contacted through a ouija board.\"\n\nScience writer Karen Stollznow has written that much of Roberts work was \"criticized for being a rip-off of Christian and\nEastern philosophy. It comes as no surprise that Seth influenced such authors as Deepak Chopra and Louise Hay.\"\n\nSince Roberts' death, others have claimed to channel Seth. In the introduction to Seth's first dictated book, \"Seth Speaks\", \"he\" says, \"communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [Seth's name for Jane] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material.\" In \"The Seth Material\", Jane Roberts wrote: \"Several people have told me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts.\" At least one person has claimed more recently to channel Roberts.\n\nBooks:\n\n\nShort Stories and novellas:\n\nPoetry Submissions:\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as a co-creator and star of the MTV reality stunt show \"Jackass\", which aired for three seasons from 2000–2002. A year later, Knoxville and his co-stars returned for the in the \"Jackass\" film series, with a second and third installment being released in 2006 and 2010, respectively. \"\" (2013), the first film in the series with a storyline, saw him star as his \"Jackass\" character Irving Zisman. Knoxville has had acting roles in films such as \"Men in Black II\" (2002), \"A Dirty Shame\", \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", \"The Ringer\", and a cameo role as a sleazy corporate president of a skateboard company in \"Lords of Dogtown\" (all 2005), \"The Last Stand\" (2013) and \"Skiptrace\" (2016). He also voiced Leonardo in \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (2014).\n\nKnoxville was born Philip John Clapp in Knoxville, Tennessee. His father, Philip, was a tire/car salesman, and his mother, Lemoyne Clapp (née Houck), taught Sunday school.\n\nKnoxville credits a copy of Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road\", given to him by his cousin, singer-songwriter Roger Alan Wade, with giving him the acting bug.\n\nAfter graduating from South Young High School in 1989 in Knoxville, he moved to California to become an actor. In the beginning, Knoxville appeared mostly in commercials and made several minor appearances as an extra. \n\nWhen the \"big break\" he sought eluded him, he decided to create his own opportunities by writing and pitching article ideas to various magazines. An idea to test self-defense equipment on himself captured the interest of Jeff Tremaine's skateboarding magazine \"Big Brother\", and the stunts were filmed and included in \"Big Brother\" \"Number Two\" video.\n\nKnoxville is responsible for many of the ideas in \"Jackass\", and is often seen as the de facto leader of the crew. The show also stars Jeff Tremaine, Sean Cliver, Spoezy, and Dave Carnie who produced a pilot that used footage from \"Big Brother\" and Bam Margera's CKY videos. \n\nWith help from Tremaine's friend, film director Spike Jonze, they pitched a series to various networks. A deal was made with MTV and \"Jackass\" was born. \n\nKnoxville also participated in the Gumball 3000 for \"Jackass\" along with co-stars Steve-O, Chris Pontius, \"Jackass\" director Jeff Tremaine, and producer Dimitry Elyashkevich. Prior to \"Jackass\" premiering on MTV, Knoxville and company turned down an offer to perform their stunts for \"Saturday Night Live\" on a weekly basis, though Knoxville later hosted a 2005 episode of the show.\n\nKnoxville has been in several feature films, most notably starring opposite Seann William Scott in Jay Chandrasekhar's adaptation of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". He starred in \"\", \"Jackass Number Two\", and \"Jackass 3D\" (which marked the 10th anniversary of the franchise). He played a two-headed alien in the 2002 film \"Men in Black II\".

He guest-starred in a Season 3 episode \"Prank Wars\" on \"Viva La Bam\", in which he and Ryan Dunn trashed Bam Margera's Hummer and performed other pranks. He voiced himself in an episode of \"Family Guy\". He co-produces \"The Dudesons in America\" and the now-canceled \"Nitro Circus\" on MTV.\n\nIn 2010, Knoxville hosted a three-part online video for Palladium Boots titled \"Detroit Lives\". The videos focus on the resurgence of creativity in Detroit. Knoxville guest starred as the voice of Johnny Krill, an extreme sports enthusiast, in \"Extreme Spots\", a 2012 episode of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". Knoxville voiced Leonardo in the 2014 film, \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" but did not appear in the \nsequel.\n\nKnoxville has a production company called Dickhouse Productions, which he owns and operates with Jeff Tremaine and Spike Jonze of the Jackass franchise. Dickhouse's projects include \"The Birth of Big Air\" (2010), a documentary about Mat Hoffman that was part of ESPN's \"30 for 30\" series, and \"The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia\" (2010), both of which have been picked up by Tribeca Films.\n\nIn May 2014, Knoxville (along with \"Jackass\" Executive Producer/H.M.F.I.C. Derek Freda) formally announced the formation of a new production company called 'Hello Junior', which will continue Knoxville's now-longstanding relationship with Paramount Pictures, who have signed an exclusive two-year first-look deal with Knoxville and 'Hello Junior' in the wake of the massive success of \"Bad Grandpa\" in late 2013. \n\nKnoxville was quoted as saying, \"I am over the damn moon about continuing an amazing partnership with Paramount Pictures,\" he said. \"I have many more films to make and bones to break. I am glad I will be doing it for Paramount.\"\n\nKnoxville married Melanie Lynn Cates on May 15, 1995. They have a daughter, Madison (born 1996). His daughter can be heard in the credits for \"Jackass Number Two\", is seen in \"The Making of Jackass Two\" on the special features on the DVD, and was seen in the credits of \"Jackass 3D\", punching Tremaine with a boxing glove. After eleven years of marriage, the couple separated in July 2006. Knoxville filed for divorce on July 3, 2007. The marriage was legally ended in March 2008, with final divorce arrangements settled in July 2009.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, Knoxville announced that he and his girlfriend Naomi Nelson were expecting a baby. Nelson gave birth to a son, Rocko Akira Clapp, on December 20, 2009 in Los Angeles. Knoxville and Nelson married on September 24, 2010. Nelson gave birth to a daughter, Arlo Lemoyne Yoko Clapp, on October 6, 2011, in Los Angeles.\n\nOn January 15, 2009, at the Los Angeles International Airport security workers discovered an inert grenade in his carry-on; he was detained and was cited for carrying a prohibited item into the airport. He was released following the investigation when it was determined that the item was a prop from a commercial, and that an assistant had packed his bag for him.\n\nOn February 4, 2009, Knoxville explained on \"The Howard Stern Show\" how he tore his urethra during a stunt for \"Nitro Circus\" explaining how he had to flush it twice daily. He said this was done by \"sticking a tube into his penis all the way up to his bladder\", referring to the practice of urinary catheterization. Knoxville said the process prevented scar tissue from forming and performed the procedure \"twice a day for three and a half years\" after the injury.\n\n"}

{"id": "32367337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32367337", "title": "Kamal Abbas", "text": "Kamal Abbas\n\nKamal Abbas () is General Coordinator of the Center for Trade Unions and Workers Services (CTUWS), an activist group for independent unions in Egypt. Involved in activism for over 20 years, Abbas has been active in mobilizing worker support during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and its aftermath. His approach emphasizes peaceful strikes and rallies accompanied by demands for better wages and working conditions, as well as more regular elections for union officials, and an independent union system.\n\nHe began his work by organizing a strike at a steel plant in Helwan, Egypt in 1989, for which he was arrested, tortured, and fired. That incident led to his starting the CTUWS and advocating for workers' rights throughout Egypt. Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called Abbas \"a major annoyance\" to President Hosni Mubarak's regime, and \"passionate, methodical and accustomed to police surveillance.\"\n\nIn 2007, Abbas was charged with defamation and sentenced to one year of prison. There was international condemnation of the ruling, with major labor and human rights groups defending Abbas. In February 2012 he was once again sentenced to a prison term, this time six months for \"insulting\" a public official.\n\nAbbas' work gained momentum and attention during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, where he helped mobilize workers in the nationwide movement for civil rights and the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's regime.\n\nAbbas began working in a steel mill in 1975 at the age of 20. While under the Mubarak regime, Abbas began organizing workers, despite unions being dominated by the state-approved Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF). In 1989 he participated in a strike at the Iron and Steel Company plant in Helwan where 19,000 workers sought wage increases and a meal during work. They were met by 10,000 riot police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the striking workers; ultimately the strike was broken up when security forces stormed the plant, resulting on one death, one hundred injuries and hundreds of arrests.\n\nAbbas was arrested four times in the subsequent months, including 45 days of detention in which he was tortured. Following, he was terminated for participating in an “illegal” strike not sanctioned by the official trade union.\n\nSeveral months later in 1990, Abbas co-founded CTUWS in Helwan to support workers and address the lack of independent unions in the private sector. He was guided by the advice of Yusuf Darwish, a long-time communist and labor lawyer, with whom Abbas had previously led the People’s Socialist Party. Abbas had studied world labor movements, looking up to the power of unions in Europe and the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s. Abbas changed his ideological focus from his early ties to Marxist politics, instead focusing CTUWS on practical reform.\n\nAbbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests.\n\nIn 1998 Abbas commented on the July strikes at the Egypt-Helwan Textiles Factory and the Nasr Pharmaceutical plant. Abbas saw the incidents as a test of the future of privatisation. He said, \"People can now see that there is a choice, that they can say no.\"\n\nIn 1999 he spoke out on the need for education and training for workers. He said, \"In Korea, development was based on a comprehensive educational policy. We still do not see this happening here. Even in the new factories, production lines are imported with a foreign expert to run them. They are assembly plants and the Egyptian worker does not have to be very skilled. The Egyptian worker does not gain the kind of knowledge that can make him an interactive part of the production process.\"\n\nIn the 2000 Parliamentary elections, Abbas nominated himself as an independent labor representative for Helwan. Abbas said that his General Union for Mineral, Electrical, and Engineering Industries at first refused to grant him status as a labor representative. According to Abbas, he received it, \"Following a long and exhausting struggle with the general union council.\" He also criticized the candidacy of Minister Sayed Mash'al and supported Safir Nigm for minister of military production in the Helwan area. Abbas argued, \"After Mash'al took over, there was a massive explosion at one of the factories. Five workers died and compensation was inadequate. When workers complained, [Mash'al] had dozens of them sent to jail.\"\n\nIn 2001 Abbas commented on the increasing privatisation of employment and the role of professional committees. He said, \"Approximately 50 per cent of the number of trade union members who make up the current trade union structure belong to and vote for 'professional committees.'\" Drivers in the Helwan district, Abbas said, are members of a professional committee, as are the construction workers in Shubra. \"These are committees that have few functions. For example, a driver will only go to his union when getting his licence because he needs their signature. We cannot consider these committees or their members active components of the trade union structure or the working class.\" He noted the changing nature of political alliances regarding unions: \"And this time around, the left has changed its election programme from calling for the protection of the public sector to focusing on the protection of workers' rights, irrespective of who the management is.\"\n\nIn 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and \"pure\" agricultural work when done by women and minors.\n\nIn 2003 Abbas began seeking formal registration in line with Article 11 of Law 84/2002, which deals with NGO registration, security and public order. Abbas was critical of the registration procedures: \"The law is bad and it is designed to co-opt you under government control. And there has been heavy government pressure. But we decided to try and open negotiations with them. After all, in Egypt you never know what is going to happen—things could get even worse tomorrow.\" Abbas fought attempts to exclude the words \"worker\" and \"trade union\" from the organization name or scope. \"They wanted us to change our name, but we won't, it's internationally recognized. They said the name breaches Article 11. We said no, Article 11 has to do with your goals...They said that our work could breach article 11. 'Your problem is that you speak for workers in disputes, and this we can not allow. There are government agencies and organizations that already do this, and you cannot have face to face meetings [on these issues].'\"\n\nIn 2005 Abbas was critical of how workers' rights were being addressed in the political dialogue. He said, \"Unfortunately, the labour movement's democratic demands are absent from the agenda of change called for by the opposition. Even the political parties that are close to workers' circles—such as the Tagammu and Nasserist parties—are only interested now in the laws that regulate political participation and professional syndicates.\" He told the Egyptian newspaper \"Al-Ahram\", \"Political movements that once upheld the interests of the working class based themselves on public sector workers, most of whom have been liquidated through early retirement schemes...the current environment where workers see people taking on the state and putting up a fight has created a situation in which we can see renewed labour activism of the sort now taking place...I do not think that such a movement would have been possible if it were not for the current movement for political reform.\"\n\nIn 2005 Abbas criticized the negotiations in the Esco workers' protest. He noted that clause 69 of the labor contract, which stipulated workers could be fired if they fail to perform \"essential duties\", was broad enough to permit random firings. Abbas also criticized requirements that protests be approved by the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU). He said, \"Workers go on strike to improve their material conditions. They are not staging a play. They are not rehearsing for some media circus. And they should not be forced to strike within the straitjacket of a preset timetable. This defeats the purpose of the strike because it limits the workers' bargaining power.\"\n\nIn June 2005 Abbas commented on legal issues dealing with the Al-Amrya Weaving and Textile Company. He said, \"The distinction between public and private sector workers will in any case become irrelevant, sooner or later, given that the entire public sector is on the block. What is important in this case is that the Unified Labour Law (12) of 2003 doesn't differentiate between private and public sector workers. Misr Al-Amrya cannot legally argue on the basis of state workers' rights to base salary increments versus private sector workers' non-rights. Which is why, in the end, the company did eventually comply.\"\n\nIn July 2005 Abbas was attacked by plain-clothes Egyptian security forces while demonstrating against human rights abuses by the Mubarak regime. He was badly wounded.\n\nIn 2005 Abbas also criticized the Muslim Brotherhood for being two-faced in their approach to civil rights. \"Egypt has never had democracy. For now the Brotherhood stands for civil rights, but its basic stance is against them. It has one language for the media and another for its followers.\"\n\nIn November 2006 Abbas dismissed the significance of General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) elections, arguing that public sector industrial workers overseen by the GFTU were increasingly few. He recommended switching focus to uninionized private sector workers: \"The minister of investment has openly stated that except for four companies the little that remains of the industrial public sector is for sale...the real battle is to fight for trade union pluralism, to build a new and independent trade union structure.\"\n\nIn November 2007 Abass criticized the government sale of companies to international investors, arguing the transactions led to workers losing their jobs.\n\nIn 2007 he criticized the state of politics, calling the regime illegitimate, and saying that Egypt is \"a suffering society with no way to express itself.\" He speculated that poverty in Cairo could lead to a violent confrontation with the police. Abbas envisioned a charismatic opposition leader who could rise up amidst the tension, but he did not believe such an individual would be part of the labor movement. He said, \"Those who think the labor movement will lead to political change in Egypt are foolish. The movement is still too young. We have to be concerned with the economic conditions of the workers. We can't rush things.\"\n\nIn April 2007 Abbas' CTUWS office was shut down and he was accused of working with \"external forces\" in order to disrupt the country's economy. The government closed CTUWS' Helwan headquarters and two other branches in Nag' Hamadi and Mehala Al-Kobra for \"security reasons\".\n\nIn September 2007 Abbas and another writer were convicted of defamation and public abuse after writer Mohamed Helmy published an article on corruption at the 15th of May Youth Center, where Abbas was a member of the board. The story was published in \"Kalam Sanay'iya\", a magazine published by the CTUWS. The lawsuit for alleged \"slander and defamation of character\" against Abbas—and his co-defendant lawyer Mohamed Helmi—was filed by Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim, chairman of the board of directors at the youth center. Ibrahim filed three petitions against Abbas and claimed that the magazine article \"publicly defamed him as a state-appointed civil servant\". He based his case on Article 188 of the Egyptian code of law, which penalizes false reporting (anyone who \"publishes false news, statements or rumours likely to disturb public order\" may face a prison sentence). Abbas was sentenced to one year in prison.\n\nAbout the incident, Abbas commented to National Public Radio, \"The government is also very sensitive about any links between political powers in Egypt and the labor movement because this would mean that workers might enter with their weight into the democratic movement. They're very scared of this.\"\n\n\"It is clear the judge's decision to give me a one-year jail sentence is political...It is no coincidence that I was sentenced at about the same time as the journalists and editors,\" Abbas told Ahram Weekly. \"The court had regularly adjourned the case since May, deciding to issue a ruling only on 21 September. Prosecuting and sentencing journalists for publishing offences is all part of the government's general crack-down on civil liberties. The government feels threatened by the strikes, especially actions taken by the militant Mehala Al-Kubra textile workers whose latest strike was settled last week. They need a scapegoat for their failed policies. This is why they closed down our offices, refuse to license us and continue to accuse the CTUWS of inciting the strikes. The allegations are flattering but untrue. How could we possibly have incited the tens of thousands of workers who have gone on strike since December?\" he said.\n\nCTUWS criticized the conviction. \"What does it mean when courts seek to imprison citizens, who publish the facts about corruption cases? The allegations against Ibrahim were found to be true and were the basis for the legal decision... Does it mean that the courts are offering immunity to corrupt officials, that they are offering protection against any criticism or disclosure?\"\n\nInternational labor and human rights groups came out in support of Abbas and condemned the court decision. The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ITUC), accused the Mubarak regime of going after opposition groups and media. \"We are very concerned about this latest attack on the CTUWS. We are particularly concerned that these prison sentences follow a long tradition of repression of the CTUWS, an independent civil society organization committed to defending trade union and workers rights in Egypt,\" said Guy Ryder, ITUC general secretary. A coalition of the Italian trade unions sent a letter to Mubarak asking him to \"ensure that CTUWS is not persecuted and demanding that \"this particular case could be reviewed. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network also issued a statement \"expressing its deep concern over the case.\n\nEgyptian labour historian Joel Beinin said, \"The attack on CTUWS is part of the intensification of the assault of the Mubarak regime against its opponents\". Faiza Rady considered the prison sentence an attack on the defence of workers' rights.\n\nAfter Abbas' and Helmy's September conviction, an investigation by the Governor of Cairo found the charges of corruption at the youth center to be true. Cairo Governor Abdel Azim Wazir ordered the entire board of the center to be disbanded.\n\nAbbas appealed his conviction at a Dec. 29 hearing. He and Helmy remained free between the case and the appeal.\n\nIn 2009 Human Rights Watch noted a significant increase \"in the harassment of human rights activists at Cairo airport\", which included the detainment of Abbas.\n\nIn 2010 the Egyptian Minister of Planning created a committee regarding minimum wage, which Abbas criticized for not acting. Abbas supported working with the new committee's goals, which included a minimum annual salary increase of seven per cent. He also criticized the labour complaints committee for not meeting regularly.\n\nIn 2010 Abbas criticized proposals to postpone trade union elections. Abbas criticized the role of the ETUF as \"a governmental institution, not a federation of genuine trade unions. Nor does it represent Egypt's workers in any way.\" Abbas also noted the practice of elected officials busing in members of their constituency to vote.\n\nIn May 2010 Abbas criticized the forced end of a protest in Cairo by workers from Amonsito, the Egyptian Telephone Company and el-Nubaria Agricultural Engineering, who had been protesting for several months. Abbas had said he would submit a complaint to the International Labour Organization about the incident.\n\nIn August 2010 Abbas criticized the constitutionality of military courts being used on civilians working in military production facilities.\n\nAlso in August Abbas criticized ETUF head Megawer of being an appointed labor representative in positions that are mandated to be elected. Abbas also criticized Megawer's affiliation with the National Democratic Party (NDP), suggesting that the ETUF should not be determining eligibility for parliamentary elections. Abbas argued, \"The ETUF has actually granted a number of businessmen and retired officers, from the ruling party, the status of labor representatives when they are not laborers in any way shape or form.\"\n\nDuring the revolution, Abbas made an appeal for new trade unions at Tahrir Square. He said, “On January 30th we met with representative of other independent trade union organizations and we discussed forming a new federation. We then made an announcement in Tahrir square, calling for a new federation. But at the time we had no idea what would happen. Since then this call has been responded to by the workers. The challenge now that the revolution has succeeded is to be able to build a society of social justice.”\n\nIn February 2011 Abbas criticized the elections in federation syndicates for being corrupt with fraud. He said, \"There are 116 verdicts of administrative court annulling the last union elections and we believe members of the federation were involved in acts of violence against the protesters in Tahrir.” Abbas recommended creating independent syndicates, saying, \"We will do as our grandfathers did before 1952 when the first unions were created in Egypt.”\n\nAlso in February, Abbas supported strikes motivated by \"how many billions the Mubarak family was worth.\"\n\nIn May 2011 Abbas celebrated International Workers' Day (also known as \"May Day\"), the international socialist commemoration of workers' rights reform begun in the United States. Abbas deemed that year's celebrations “historic” for marking a break from the ETUF. Abbas also praised the then newly formed Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EITUF). May Day celebrations focused on the free will of Egyptian workers to form independent trade unions, free from state control, and the dismantling of the ETUF.\n\nIn June 2011, Abbas was co-filer of a lawsuit calling for the dissolution of the state-controlled ETUF. The suit called for \"sequestration of the ETUF headquarters, buildings, its Workers' University, cultural institute, hospitals and clinics\" as well as \"barring the ETUF from representing Egypt's workers or unions at international conferences\".\n\nAbbas interrupted the ETUF's Ismail Fahmy during his speech at the International Labour Organization (ILO) June 2011 conference. Abbas criticized the ETUF saying, \"Enough ... all these years ... and crimes enough! ... Enough you killers! ... You participated in the passage of the privatization deals, and facilitated and justified the blatant attacks on the rights of workers ... You defended with impunity Mubarak's regime with its corruption, repression and tyranny, and then you plotted against the killing of the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square!\"\n\nDuring the 2011 revolution Abbas made a video from Tahrir Square telling American workers who were on strike in Wisconsin:\n\"From this place, I want you to know that we stand with you as you stood with us. I want you to know that no power can challenge the will of the people when they believe in their rights. When they raise their voices loud and clear and struggle against exploitation. No one believed that our revolution could succeed against the strongest dictatorship in the region. But in 18 days the revolution achieved the victory of the people….We want you to know that we stand on your side. Stand firm and don’t waiver. Don’t give up on your rights. Victory always belongs to the people who stand firm and demand their just rights. We and all the people of the world stand on your side and give you our full support. As our just struggle for freedom, democracy and justice succeeded, your struggle will succeed. Victory belongs to you when you stand firm and remain steadfast in demanding your just rights.\"\n\nIn March 2011, Abbas participated in a labour panel discussing the future of trade unions following the fall of Mubarak's regime. At the end of the panel, Abbas declared, “the regime has fallen...the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions has fallen! What more do you want? Go create your own unions!”\n\nOn 29 February 2012, the CTUWS reported that Abbas had been sentenced \"in absentia\" to six months in prison for \"insulting\" a public official.\n\n\n"}

This is known as \"kanashibari.\" Even though the Kijimuna are tricksters, they have been known to make friends with humans. However, these relationships often go sour. A kijimuna may offer to carry a human on its back as it leaps through the mountains and over the seas. The kijimuna dislike people passing gas on their backs, however, and will immediately throw the human off, no matter where they were at the moment. The kijimuna also hate octopuses.\n\nThe kijimuna are a common subject in Okinawan folk tales. Many of their stories begin with the kijimuna becoming a human's friend and then ending with the relationship going bad. One story tells of a kijimuna's friend burning down his tree, so the kijimuna fled to the mountains.\n"}

{"id": "11729878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11729878", "title": "Lithuanian name", "text": "Lithuanian name\n\nA Lithuanian personal name, like in mostly European cultures, consists of two main elements: the given name (\"vardas\") followed by family name (\"pavardė\"). The usage of personal names in Lithuania is generally governed (in addition to personal taste or family custom) by three major factors: civil law, canon law, and tradition. Lithuanian names always follow the rules of the Lithuanian language. Lithuanian male names, as well as the rest of words, have preserved the Indo-European masculine endings (\"-as\"; \"-is\"), although the rules are not as rigid as Latvian names, which preserve masculine/feminine endings even for foreign names.\n\nA child in Lithuania is usually given one or two given names. Nowadays the second given name is rarely used in everyday situations, the use of a middle name being considered pretentious. In addition to modern names, parents normally choose a name or names for their child from a long list of traditional names which may be:\n\n\nIt is the most ancient layer of Lithuanian personal names; a majority of them are dual-stemmed personal names, of Indo-European origin. These ancient Lithuanian names are constructed from two interconnected stems, the combination of which has been used to denote certain beneficial personal qualities, for example \"Jo-gaila\" mean \"a strong rider\". Although virtually extinct following the Christianization of Lithuania, they continued to exist as surnames, such as Goštautas, Kęsgaila, Radvila or in their Slavicised versions, as well as in toponyms. The existing surnames and written sources have allowed the reconstruction of names by linguists, such as Kazimieras Būga. During the Interbellum these names returned to popular use after a long period of neglect. Children are often named in honor of the most revered historical Lithuanian rulers, making their names one of the most popular. They include Vytautas, Gediminas, Algirdas, Žygimantas. In line with the double-stemmed names, shorter variants containing only one stem were also used, such as Vytenis and Kęstutis. Since there are few pre-Christian female names attested in written sources, they are often reconstructed from male variants, in addition to the historical Birutė, Aldona, Rimgailė etc.\n\n\nThe use of Christian names in the Lithuanian language long predates the adoption of Christianity by Lithuanians. The linguistic data attest that first Biblical names were started to be used in Aukštaitija as early as in the 11th century. The earliest strata of such names originates from Old Church Slavonic; they were borrowed by Eastern Orthodoxy in their Byzantine versions. The examples of such names are \"Antanas\" (St. Anthony), \"Povilas\" or \"Paulius\" (St. Paul), \"Andrius\" (St. Andrew) and \"Jurgis\" (St. George). The later influx of Christian names came after the adoption of Christianity in 1387. They are mostly borrowed in their Polish versions: \"Jonas\" (St. John), \"Vladislovas\"/\"Vladas\" (St. Ladislaus), \"Kazimieras\"/\"Kazys\" (St. Casimir), etc.\n\n\nThere are popular names constructed from the words for celestial bodies (\"Saulė\" for the Sun, \"Aušrinė\" for Venus), events of nature (\"Audra\" for the storm, \"Aušra\" for the dawn, \"Rasa\" for the dew, \"Vėjas\" for the wind, \"Aidas\" for the echo), plants (\"Linas\"/\"Lina\" for flax, \"Eglė\" for spruce), river names (\"Ūla\", \"Vilija\" for River Neris).\n\n\nSome names were created by the authors of literal works and spread in public use through them. Such names were invented following the rules of the Lithuanian language; therefore it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the name is fictitious and had never existed before. Notably, \"Gražina\", \"Živilė\" by Adam Mickiewicz, \"Daiva\" by Vydūnas, \"Šarūnas\" by Vincas Krėvė and others.\n\n\nThere are some popular names of gods and goddesses from Lithuanian mythology that are used as personal names, such as \"Laima\", goddess of luck, \"Žemyna\", goddess of earth, \"Gabija\", goddess of fire; \"Žilvinas\", a serpent prince from the fairy tale \"Eglė the Queen of Serpents\", \"Jūratė\", goddess of the sea, and \"Kastytis\", from the legend about \"Jūratė and Kastytis\".\n\nA distinctive practice dominated in the ethnic region of Lithuania Minor, then being a part of East Prussia, where Lithuanized German personal names were common, such as \"Ansas\" (Hans), \"Grėtė\" (Gretchen), \"Vilius\" (Wilhelm) among Prussian Lithuanians. Some of them are still in use among Lithuanians at present.\n\nThe choice of a given name is largely influenced by fashion. Many parents may name their child after a national hero or heroine, some otherwise famous person, or a character from a book, film, or TV show. In spite of this, a great number of names used in today's Lithuania have been in use since the ancient times.\n\nLithuanian male and female names are different grammatically. Almost all Lithuanian female names end in the vowels \"-a\" or \"-ė\", while male names almost always end in \"-s\", and rarely in a vowel \"-a\". When the male name ending in \"-a\" has its female counterpart, it ends in \"-ė\", such as \"Jogaila\" and \"Jogailė\". Female double-stemmed Lithuanian names always end in \"-ė\".\n\nDiminutives are very popular in everyday usage, and are by no means reserved for children. The Lithuanian language allows for a great deal of creativity in this field. Most diminutives are formed by adding a suffix. For female names it may be \"-elė\", \"-utė\", \"-ytė\", \"-užė\"; certain suffixes are more common to specific names over the rest.\n\nAlso, as in many other cultures, a person may informally use a nickname (\"pravardė\") in addition to or instead of a given name.\n\nLithuanian surnames, like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally patrilineal, i.e., passed from the father on to his children.\n\nA married woman usually adopts her husband's name. However, other combinations are legally possible. The wife may keep her maiden name (\"mergautinė pavardė\") or add her husband's surname to hers, thus creating a double-barrelled name. It is also possible, though rare, for the husband to adopt his wife's surname or to add his wife's surname to his family name.\n\nFamily names first appeared in Lithuania ca. end of 14th century beginning 15th century and were only reserved to the Lithuanian nobility. They usually derived from patronymics.\n\nThe most striking peculiarity of the historical Lithuanian heraldic system, which is adopted from the Polish one in the Union of Horodlo in 1413, is that a coat of arms does not belong to a single family. A number of unrelated families (sometimes hundreds of them), usually with a number of different family names, may use a coat of arms, and each coat of arms has its own name.\n\nThe use of family names gradually spread to other social groups: the townsfolk by the end of the 17th century, then the peasantry. People from the villages did not have last names until the end of the 18th century. In cases like this their village of origin was usually noted in documents. The process ended only in the mid-19th century, and due partial Polonization of society at the time many names were influenced by Polish form of the name.\n\nBased on origin, several groups of Lithuanian family names may be recognized.\n\nA cognominal surname derives from a person's nickname, usually based a physical or character trait.\n\nExamples: \n\nExamples of occupational surnames: \n\nA toponymic surname usually derives from the name of a village or town, or the name of a topographic feature.\n\nExamples:\n\nA patronymic surname derives from a given name of a person and usually ends in a suffix suggesting a family relation.\n\nExamples:\n\nFor this group of names the use of suffixes that cognate to the Slavic equivalent, such as \"-avičius\" (cognate of \"-owicz\"), \"-auskas\" (cognate of \"-owski\") is common: Jankauskas (cognate of Slavic Jankowski), Adamkevičius (cognate of Adamkowicz), Lukoševičius (cognate of Lukaszewicz).\n\nA number of surnames are diminutives of popular first names.\n\nLithuanian surnames have specific masculine and feminine forms. While a masculine surname usually ends in \"-as\", \"-ys\" or \"-is\", its feminine equivalent ends in \"-ienė\" or rarely \"-uvienė\" for married women and \"-aitė\", \"-utė\", \"-iūtė\" or \"-ytė\" for unmarried ones.\nExamples:\nIn 2003, Lithuanian laws allowed women to use a short form, without disclosing the marital status (ending in -ė instead of -ienė/-aitė/etc.: Adamkus –> Adamkė). These names are used, although traditional forms are still predominant.\nAccording to the Department of Statistics of Lithuania, the most popular feminine family names are:\n\nLithuanians pay great attention to the correct way of referring to or addressing other people depending on the level of social distance, familiarity and politeness. The differences between formal and informal language include:\n\n\"Ponas\" and \"Ponia\" (vocative case \"Pone\", \"Ponia\") are the basic honorific styles used in Lithuanian to refer to a man or woman, respectively. In the past, these styles were reserved to members of the \"szlachta\" and played more or less the same roles as \"Lord\" or \"Sir\" and \"Lady\" or \"Madam\" in English. Since the 19th century, they have come to be used in all strata of society and may be considered equivalent to the English \"Mr.\" and \"Ms.\" There is a separate style, \"Panelė\" (\"Miss\"), applied to an unmarried woman.\n\nThe given name(s) normally comes before the surname. However, in a list of people sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname usually comes first. In many formal situations the given name is omitted altogether.\n\nInformal forms of address are normally used only by relatives, close friends and co-workers. In such situations diminutives are often preferred to the standard forms of given names.\n\n\n"}

In July 1953 she married broadcaster and composer Dawid Engela. She left South Africa in September 1953 for London, and then went via The Hague to Vienna. In January 1954 she started training with Maria Hittorff and Josef Witt.\n\nCoertse made her debut in January 1955 as the \"first flower girl\" in Wagner's \"Parsifal\" at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, Karl Böhm conducting. She also sang in Basle at the Teatro San Carlo. On 17 March 1956 she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera as the Queen of the Night in \"Die Zauberflöte\" by Mozart and remained with the Vienna State Opera until 1978. Her Covent Garden debut was in 1956, in the same role. \n\nHer roles were limited in the United Kingdom as the Equity boycott of South Africa due to Apartheid, prevented its members from having anything to do with South Africa's entertainment industry.\nCoertse sang the soprano part in Bach's \"Matthäus-Passion\" at Fritz Wunderlich's first appearance in Vienna in 1958, when he performed the tenor arias with Julius Patzak singing the Evangelist.

Separated from his father Jo Gray, Hilda took him to grow up with her father at Middle View near Dalgety on the Snowy River. His grandfather brought him up. George Hedger was son of a man that newspaper reports said was the original inspiration for the Banjo Paterson poem \"The Man from Snowy River\". \n\nNoel and Hilda moved to Sydney and he attended a number of technical schools and at the Sydney Technical School passed the Intermediate Certificate He then went to worked in the radio industry culminating in a position at Kriesler as a technician before the War.\n\nGray enlisted in the army in August 1942. During World War II he was trained at the Army School of Radio Physics, whereupon he became a radar technician and Senior Radar Artificer. He also attended No. 6 OCTU.\n\nGray returned to LHQ where he was placed in charge of the Drawing Office and maintenance section. He helped to install the radar defenses on Rottnest Island for Western Australia and was the Senior Radar Artificer at Exmouth Gulf.

He designed and developed printed circuit board production methods that he incorporated into his designed Kriesler Duplex radios, but were not adopted until a later date. A number of patents were taken out on his work and he was sent on a World study tour by Phillips where he introduced his printed circuits to their founder. \n\nGray resigned from Kreisler in 1959 to start a medical electronics business, an ambition he had developed while studying medicine from 1948 - 50.

As the Greeks were still seen as the masters in this field, as in philosophy and most sciences, the leading Roman families often either sent their sons to study these things under a famous master in Greece (as was the case with the young Julius Caesar), or engaged a Greek teacher (under pay or as a slave).\n\nIn the young revolutionary French republic, \"Orateur\" (French for \"orator\", but compare the Anglo-Saxon parliamentary speaker) was the formal title for the delegated members of the Tribunat to the Corps législatif, to motivate their ruling on a presented bill.\n\nIn the 19th century, orators and lecturers, such as Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and Col.

He was an important figure of the July Monarchy in France, and the Minister of Justice in the government of the Papal States, under Pope Pius IX.\n\nRossi was born in Carrara, then under the Duchy of Massa and Carrara. Educated at the University of Pisa and the University of Bologna, he became professor of law at the latter in 1812. In 1815 he gave his support to Joachim Murat and his Neapolitan anti-Austrian expedition: after the latter's fall, he escaped to France, and then proceeded to Geneva, where he began teaching a course of jurisprudence applied to Roman law, the success of which gained him the unusual honour of naturalization as a citizen of Geneva. In 1820 he was elected as a deputy to the cantonal council, and was a member of the diet of 1832; Rossi was entrusted with the task of drawing up a revised constitution, which was known as the \"Pacte Rossi\". This was rejected by a majority of the diet, a result which deeply affected Rossi, and made him accept the invitation of François Guizot to settle in France.\n\nHere he was appointed in 1833 to the chair of political economy in the Collège de France, vacated by the death of Jean-Baptiste Say. He was naturalized as a French citizen in 1834, and in the same year became professor of constitutional law in the faculty of law of the Paris University. In 1836 he was elected a member of the Academy of Political and Moral Sciences, was raised to the French peerage in 1839, and in 1843 became dean of the faculty of law.\n\nIn 1842 Rossi and Count Ferdinand-Charles-Philippe d' Esterno (1805–83) organized the first meetings of what would become the Société d'économie politique.\n\nIn 1845, Guizot appointed Rossi ambassador of France to the Papal States, with a specific mission to discuss the question of the Jesuits. However, the French Revolution of 1848 toppled Guizot's regime, and the revolution in Italy fully severed Rossi's connection with France. Rossi thus remained at Rome and became Minister of the Interior under Pius IX. Rossi's program of liberal reforms, however, never took off, as his brand of conservative liberalism, in which suffrage was to be limited to the well-off and the economic and social disruptions created by industrialization went unaddressed, had narrow appeal.\n\nHis assassination took place on the stairs at the opening of the Parliament in the Palazzo della Cancelleria on 15 November 1848 by a stab wound to the neck. This was one of the causes of the flight from Rome of Pope Pius IX and the beginning of the series of events that led to the proclamation of the Roman Republic.\n\nThe murderer was said to be Luigi Brunetti, the elder son of Angelo Brunetti (or Ciceruacchio), who acted at the instigation of Pietro Sterbini, and with the cooperation of some veterans or \"reduci\" of the conflict in Lombardy. After the murder, the senate adjourned without much sorrow, and little to no attention to the murder victim. That night crowds at the house of Rossi's widow chanted \"Blessed is the hand that stabbed the Rossi\". Sterbini went on to play a prominent role in the Roman Republic in 1849, but fled into exile after its fall, until 1861. In a trial held in 1854, a man by the name of Gabriele Constantini was convicted and executed.\n\nThe city of Carrara erected a statue in honour of Pellegrino Rossi.\n\n\n"}

He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in physics in 1924, the first year in which Caltech awarded this degree, for his thesis on \"the absorption coefficient for slow electrons in gases\". He showed that molecules with similar arrangements of their external electrons have similar cross sections for collisions with slow electrons. These results could not be readily explained with classical physics, and their importance would not be realised until 1966.\n\nOn graduation, Brode became an Associate Physicist at the National Bureau of Standards. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oriel College, Oxford, in England in 1924 and 1925, and then a National Research Council Fellowship, which he used to study at the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1925 and 1926, and then at Princeton University from 1926 to 1927. On returning to the United States, he married Bernice Hedley Bidwell on September 16, 1926. They had two sons.\n\nBrode became an assistant professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1927, and a full professor in 1932. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which enabled him to return to England and study at Cambridge University and Birkbeck College, University of London, in 1934 and 1935. While there, he became friends with the British physicist P.M.S. Blackett. He was impressed by Blackett's cloud chambers, and set his graduate students to work on projects using them, starting with Dale R. Corson.\n\nIn 1941, after the start of World War II, Brode went to work at Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, where he helped develop the proximity fuse. In 1943, he moved with his family to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he was appointed the leader of the E-3 Fusing Group. His wife Bernice was also hired to work at Los Alamos as a human computer in the T (Theoretical) Division. Brode's group consisted of 14 civilians, 12 military officers and 37 enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment. Its task was to develop a fuse that would detonate an atomic bomb at a specified height above the ground. \n\nNormally, bombs are cheap and fuses are relatively expensive, but an atomic bomb is extremely expensive, and any failure of a triggering device is unacceptable. On the other hand, for the same reason, fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb. Brode's E-3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10,000 of failing to detonate within of the required height. The required height was not initially known, as it depended on the yield, which was uncertain. The group investigated both radar proximity fuses and barometric altimeter fuses. Testing was carried out at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia in August 1943 and Muroc Army Air Field in March 1944 using dummy drops from barrage balloons. In the end, a modified APS-13 Monica tail warning radar known as \"Archie\" was employed, and the fuses performed flawlessly in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nAfter the war, Brode returned to teaching at Berkeley. In 1950 he was one of a dozen prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the hydrogen bomb. In 1951 he returned to England for another year, this time at Manchester University as a Fulbright Scholar. Between 1930 and 1943, 15 graduate students conducted their research under his direction. He supervised another 22 between 1946 and 1957. The 37 students included Corson, who became president of Cornell University, and William B. Fretter, who was vice president of the University of California from 1978 to 1983.\n\nIn addition to his research and teaching, Brode occupied a number of other positions. He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California, Clark Kerr from 1960 to 1965, and Charles J. Hitch from 1972 to 1973, and to Angus E. Taylor, the vice-president for academic affairs, from 1967 to 1972. He served on the selection panels for Rhodes, Fulbright and Kennedy scholarships, and for awards from the State Department, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Institute of International Education. He was chairman of the Advisory Board of the Naval Ordnance Test Station from 1948 to 1955, a member of the National Research Council Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) from 1951 to 1957, and chairman of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the American Institute of Physics' Committee on Physics Faculties in Colleges from 1962 to 1965.\n\nAt various times Brode was vice president of the International Union for Pure and Applied Physics and the American Association of University Professors, a member of the Council of the American Physical Society, president of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, chairman of the Physics Division of the National Research Council, associate director for research of the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. delegate to the International Council of Scientific Unions. He was acting director of the Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory from 1964 to 1965 and director of its Education Abroad Program in the United Kingdom from 1965 to 1967.\n\nBrode became a professor emeritus at Berkeley in 1967. He died at his home in Berkeley on February 19, 1986. He was survived by his wife Bernice and his son John. His papers are in the University of California's Bancroft Library.\n\n"}
{"id": "24609629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24609629", "title": "Robert James Lees", "text": "Robert James Lees\n\nRobert James Lees (born 12 August 1849 in Hinckley, Leicestershire – died 11 January 1931 in Leicester) was a British spiritualist, medium, preacher, writer and healer of the late Victorian era and early twentieth century known today for claims that he knew the identity of Jack the Ripper, responsible for the Whitechapel murders of 1888.\n\nThe son of William Lingham Lees (1818–1880) and Elizabeth (née Patch) (1819–1883), Robert Lees was born in Hinckley and spent his early years in Birmingham. It is claimed that, following the death of Prince Albert in 1861 the 13-year-old Lees went into a trance and communicated messages from Albert to Queen Victoria. It is further claimed that Lees lived for a period in Buckingham Palace so that Victoria could regularly talk to her beloved Albert through him. None of these claims have been substantiated. The only Royal connection that has been uncovered between Lees and the Royal Family is a letter dated 23 January 1899 sent to Lees from the Privy Office thanking him for sending the Queen a copy of his book \"Through The Mists\".\n\nIn December 1871 Lees married Sarah Ann Bishop (1850–1912), whom he had first met as a boy while attending a Sunday School class in the Aston district of Birmingham. They had sixteen children, ten of whom survived to adulthood. In 1876 he moved to Manchester where he worked as a journalist for the \"Manchester Guardian\". In 1878 Lees and his family moved to London, where he worked as a journalist in Fleet Street and where he befriended W.T. Stead. He worked on several London-based publications including George Newnes' \"Tit-Bits\" magazine.\n\nLees claimed to have had his first psychic experience aged three. He later wrote:\n\n\"I am personally aware that as a child I cried at being left in the darkness unless I saw a mysterious and to others invisible kilted Highlander who remained beside me talking or singing till I fell asleep. And even now, after a lapse of half a century the vivid memory of his strong but kindly face is as freshly recalled as if he had sat beside me whilst this New Year was born.\"\n\nDespite having had little formal education, Lees wrote a series of spiritualist books which continued to sell many years after his death. He claimed that these books had been dictated to him by friends from the spirit realm, and referred to himself as \"the Recorder\". The best known is the three-volume series 'The Mists Trilogy' (\"Through the Mists\", \"The Life Elysian\", \"The Gate of Heaven\"), written between 1898 – 1931. \"The Heretic\" was written as his only autobiographical novel which was a record of his many years in London. \"An Astral Bridegroom\" was a study into reincarnation.\n\nSkeptics consider his psychic claims to be the result of self-delusion.\n\nAt the time of the Jack the Ripper murders in 1888, Lees was living in the London area. His diary entries for 1888 reveal that on 2 October, during a month when no Ripper murders took place, Lees went to both the City of London Police and Scotland Yard offering his assistance in catching Jack the Ripper. However, he was turned away as a madman on both occasions, though Scotland Yard offered to write to him.\n\nOne story, frequently quoted in books and films on the subject, is that Lees, using his psychic power, led the Police to Jack the Ripper. This story first appeared in print on 28 April 1895, in \"The Chicago Herald\". Another version of the same story was also published in \"The People\" on 19 May 1895.\n\nThe \"Chicago Herald\" article claimed that over a number of years Lees had been troubled by psychic visions of Jack the Ripper killing his victims. Each of these visions came true. Lees became disturbed by the visions and sought medical advice, going abroad as a result, where he no longer had the visions. Back in London, he and his wife Sarah were travelling on an omnibus when a man got on at Notting Hill. Lees turned and told his wife that the man was 'Jack the Ripper'. Even though his wife laughed at him, when the man got off the bus at Marble Arch Lees followed him. Finding a Police Constable on the way Lees told him of his suspicions, but the Constable also laughed at him. After more murders Lees was able to convince the Police of the truth of his visions and led them to a fashionable house in London which was home to a noted physician who had treated members of the Royal Family On being found in incriminating circumstances, the doctor was put in a lunatic asylum under the name of Thomas Mason 124, and a mock funeral held. According to the \"Chicago Herald\", the tale had been related by a Dr. Howard of London, who, when drunk, had told the story to a man who then told the newspaper.\n\nRipperologists disregard the story as a hoax. Obvious errors in the \"Chicago Herald\" story include the claim there had been 17 murders that took place over a number of years, while the actual number of Ripper victims was just five, with the actual murders occurring in just a few months in the Autumn of 1888. Melvin Harris in his book \"Jack the Ripper, The Bloody Truth\" provides convincing evidence that the story was a hoax. He believes that the hoaxers were the 'Whitechapel Club, Chicago', the offices of the Club at that time being behind those of the \"Chicago Herald\". According to Harris the police had \"denied that Lees was involved with the Ripper hunt. In Fact, Robert Lees's own diary entries contradict this part of the tale. They show that he didn't approach the police until October 2, 1888 three days after the murders on the twenty-ninth.\"\n\nIn 1976 the Lees/Ripper story came into prominence again with the publication of Stephen Knight's book \"\". Ian Sharp had rediscovered the \"Chicago Herald\" article while researching Jack the Ripper for a BBC documentary which had been screened before the publication of Knight's book. The publication of \"The Final Solution\" saw the first time that the \"Chicago Herald\" article had officially been quoted in a major publication since \"The People\" had quoted it in 1895.\n\nIn 1902 Lees moved to Ilfracombe in Devon with his family from Plymouth and remained there until about 1928, when he returned to Leicester. Lees died at his home, 'Hazelhurst', Fosse Road South, Leicester, in 1931 at the age of 81 years. His body was cremated at Gilroes Cemetery and his ashes were interred in the grave of his wife in Score Woods Cemetery at Ilfracombe.\n\nA blue plaque to commemorate Lees was commissioned by the Hinckley Civic Society and was unveiled by a descendant of Lees on Saturday 2 May 2009.\n\nRobert James Lees has been depicted in several works on fiction related to the Jack the Ripper case.\n\nIn the 1979 film \"Murder by Decree\" starring Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes, Lees was played by Donald Sutherland.\n\nIn the 1988 ITV mini-series \"Jack the Ripper\" starring Michael Caine, Lees was played by actor Ken Bones.\n\nHe is a character in the comic book \"From Hell\", written by Alan Moore, although he is omitted from its film adaptation. In the graphic novel, Lees is portrayed as a charlatan, though he is ultimately – and unwittingly – instrumental in helping Chief inspector Abberline in identifying the Ripper. Interestingly, though this version of Lees admits privately that his visions were false, he also says that they all turned out to be true.\n\nBooks written by Robert James Lees include:\n\n"}

{"id": "225620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225620", "title": "Sri Chinmoy", "text": "Sri Chinmoy\n\nChinmoy Kumar Ghose, better known as Sri Chinmoy \n(27 August 1931 – 11 October 2007), was an Indian spiritual leader who taught meditation in the West after moving to New York City in 1964. Chinmoy established his first meditation center in Queens, New York, and eventually had 7,000 students in 60 countries. A prolific author, artist, poet, and musician, he also held public events such as concerts and meditations on the theme of inner peace. Chinmoy advocated a spiritual path to God through prayer and meditation. He advocated athleticism including distance running, swimming, and weightlifting. He organized marathons and other races, and was an active runner and, following a knee injury, weightlifter.\n\nChinmoy was the youngest of seven children, born in Shakpura, Boalkhali Upazila, in the Chittagong District of East Bengal, British India (now Bangladesh). He lost his father to illness in 1943, and his mother a few months later. Chinmoy began his serious practice of meditation at the age of 11. In 1944, the 12-year-old Chinmoy joined his brothers and sisters at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, where elder brothers Hriday and Chitta had already established a presence. It was Chitta that gave Chinmoy his name which means 'full of divine consciousness'. \n\nIn the ashram he spent the next 20 years in spiritual practice, including meditation, study in Bengali and English literature, athletics, and work in the ashram's cottage industries. Chinmoy claimed that for about eight years, he was the personal secretary to the General Secretary of the ashram, Nolini Kanta Gupta. Chinmoy translated his writings from Bengali into English.\n\nAccording to Chinmoy, in 1964 he was prompted to move to the United States in response to a \"message from within\" to be of service to people in the West searching for spiritual fulfillment. With the help of Sam Spanier and Eric Hughes, American sponsors connected with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, he emigrated to New York City.\n\nHe successfully applied for a job as junior clerk at the Indian consulate, despite his lack of formal education. He received support and encouragement from his colleagues and bosses and was invited to give talks on Hinduism. He started to give talks at universities and later, at the United Nations.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chinmoy continued giving lectures and talks at universities around the U.S. on spiritual topics. In 1974 he gave lectures in 50 states at 50 universities, and these lectures were published as a six-part book series entitled \"50 Freedom-Boats to One Golden Shore\" (1974). In the 1970s and 1980s he traveled around Europe, Asia, and Australia lecturing at universities, resulting in the publication of \"The Oneness of the Eastern Heart and the Western Mind\". Chinmoy has also published books, essays, spiritual poetry, plays, and commentaries on the Vedas.\n\nIn 1966 Chinmoy opened a Sri Chinmoy Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Up until the late 1970s the main Chinmoy study centers were in New York, Florida and the West Indies. Over the next few decades Sri Chinmoy Centers were opened and established in multiple cities in the US, Europe, Australasia, South Africa and South America eventually totaling 350 centers worldwide. In 1973, the \"New York Times\" wrote that Chinmoy was \"revered in India as one of the few holy men to have reached Nirvikalpa Samadhi, the absolute highest level of consciousness\".\nDuring the 1970s Chinmoy began playing and composing on the flute and esraj. In 1984 he started giving free ‘Peace Concerts’ around the world. The largest ever concert was in Montreal, for 19,000 people.\n\nWhile in America in the 1970s, Chinmoy attracted followers such as musicians Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin, Narada Michael Walden, Roberta Flack, Clarence Clemons, and Boris Grebenshchikov. Chinmoy offered the musicians a disciplined spiritual path that forbade the use of drugs and alcohol and encouraged music and poetry as expressions of thankfulness to the Divine.\n\nSantana and McLaughlin stayed with Chinmoy for a number of years before leaving. In 1973 they released an album based on Chinmoy's teachings, titled \"Love Devotion Surrender\". McLaughlin was a Chinmoy follower from 1970 to 1975. In 1971 he formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra, named for the spiritual name Chinmoy had given him. McLaughlin introduced Santana to the guru, and Santana and his wife Deborah were subsequently Chinmoy followers from 1972 to 1981. Santana said, \"Without a guru I serve only my own vanity, but with him I can be of service to you and everybody. I am the strings, but he is the musician. Guru has graduated from the Harvards of consciousness and sits at the feet of God.\" Santana released three albums under the spiritual name \"Devadip\" – meaning \"Lamp of God\", \"Eye of God\", and \"Light of God\" – that Chinmoy gave him: \"Illuminations\" (1974), \"Oneness\" (1979), and \"The Swing of Delight\" (1980). In 2000, he told \"Rolling Stone\" that things soured between him and Chinmoy in the 1980s. Santana emphasized that he took much that was good from his years with the guru, even though when he left, Chinmoy \"was pretty vindictive for a while. He told all my friends not to call me ever again, because I was to drown in the dark sea of ignorance for leaving him.\" In 2017 Santana told \"Rolling Stone\", \"I'm really grateful for those 10 years \nI spent with that spiritual master.\"\nSpiritual teacher Frederick Lenz became a follower around 1972, but in 1981 he broke with Chinmoy and became a guru on his own. Spiritual author Lex Hixon was a member of the Sri Chinmoy Centre in the 1970s.\n\nChinmoy advocated \"self-transcendence\" by expanding one's consciousness to conquer the mind's perceived limitations, and this was often applied to athletics. Olympic gold-medalist runner Carl Lewis was advised by Chinmoy. He learned to meditate from Chinmoy, and practices the techniques regularly. A devoted Christian, Lewis stated that his involvement with Chinmoy was a step forward to spiritual fulfillment which strengthened his Christian beliefs. In 2011 Lewis appeared in the short documentary \"Challenging Impossibility\", which features the feats of strength demonstrated by Chinmoy.\n\nAccording to the team's website, members of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team have swum the English Channel over 40 times. Other Chinmoy-sponsored athletic events include ultra-distance running, including the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race; mountain climbing; and long-distance cycling. In 2010 Ashrita Furman, who holds over 150 Guinness World Records, stated that \"the meditation he learned from Sri Chinmoy helps him to perform beyond his expectations.\"\n\nIn 1987 Sri Chinmoy inaugurated the Sri Chinmoy Oneness Home Peace Run, a symbolic relay style run for peace through many countries of the world where runners carry a flaming torch representing harmony. Sri Chinmoy described his concept as a \"grassroots effort for peace\". The ‘Oneness Home’ theme of the Peace Run, is that people are all peace-longing citizens on one single planet.\n\nIn 1991 Chinmoy initiated the ‘Oneness Heart Tears and Smiles’ humanitarian service which sends food and medicine to those in need. The organisation, which as of 2007 served 136 countries, began with members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre distributing humanitarian aid to needy children and adults worldwide. It works with NGOs or governments, and provides health, medical, and educational supplies to recipient nations. It is served by health professionals and private volunteers on five continents, in programs which provide disaster relief, regional development, and health and medical supplies. The ‘Kids to kids’ program sponsored by the Oneness Heart Tears and Smiles encourages school children to prepare packs of school supplies and toys for disadvantaged children in other communities.\nChinmoy travelled widely, and dedicated his many activities and the events he founded to peace. He met with world figures, and was often described as an ambassador of peace. Chinmoy met Mother Teresa on five separate occasions. On their second meeting in Rome, Italy during October 1994, Chinmoy presented her with an award. During the ceremony Mother Teresa said to Sri Chinmoy: \"I am so pleased with all the good work you are doing for world peace and for people in so many countries. May we continue to work together and to share together all for the glory of God and for the good of man.\" Chinmoy met with Diana, Princess of Wales, at Kensington Palace on May 21, 1997.\n\nHe did not charge fees for his spiritual guidance or music performances. He was respectful towards all religions and religious figures of the world. He attracted an estimated 7,000 students in his lifetime. His path was a contemporary spiritual system of yoga, practised under the guidance of a guru, or spiritual teacher. Chinmoy advocated brahmacharya – celibacy – for both married and unmarried devotees, and focusing on experiencing inner spiritual joy rather than pleasure. According to a 1987 article in \"Hinduism Today\", Chinmoy as a yoga spiritual master was an unmarried celibate. Unlike in some other older traditions, Chinmoy taught that a complete withdrawal from the world was not necessary for spiritual progress, but rather \"a gradual and total Illumination of life\".\nUntil his death in late 2007, Chinmoy was the spiritual leader to thousands of devoted followers worldwide. From the mid-1960s he lived in his world headquarters in Queens, New York City, surrounded by hundreds of his followers who moved to the area. The Chinmoy group was considered to be a cult by some. The 1994 book \"The Joy of Sects\" stated that \"some of his followers left, however, amid accusations that Chinmoy was making sexual advances towards the wives of his disciples\", and in 2005 and 2014 \"San Diego CityBeat\" and \"Salon.com\" each posted a profile of a different female former disciple who alleged inappropriate sexual conduct. In February 2016 PIX 11 News in New York did two segments on Chinmoy, in which one former follower alleged sexual impropriety, while others praised Chinmoy and the Sri Chinmoy Centre's spokesperson stated in a written response that \"Our founder and teacher, Sri Chinmoy, led a life of the utmost purity and integrity\". Chinmoy was never sued or charged with any crime, and his lawyer denied the 2004 allegations at the time. Some journalists and former followers have criticized what they view as Chinmoy's obsessive or aggressive self-promotion. In 2009, Jayanti Tamm published an account of life as a Chinmoy disciple, \"\". Tamm, who was born into Chinmoy's organisation, claimed that Chinmoy predicted she would become his perfect disciple. She was banished from the group when she was 25. The book describes her life in the guru's inner circle and her efforts to break free from his influence. According to the book, Chinmoy banned sex, and most disciples were directed to remain single. The book also states that the guru disparaged secular education, and his prohibitions included the consumption of alcohol, caffeine, and meat; dancing; dating; socializing with outsiders; and owning pets, although he kept a collection of exotic pets in his Queens basement. Tamm notes however that the 7,000 other followers around the world, and others who encountered Chinmoy, are likely to have had different experiences and perceptions.\n\nIn 2007, Chinmoy was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by 51 Icelandic members of Parliament, a Canadian professor, and a number of Czech professors. Over the years Chinmoy had ongoing friendships with Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and Desmond Tutu.\n\nChinmoy died from a heart attack while at his home in Jamaica, Queens, New York on 11 October 2007. Mikhail Gorbachev wrote that his death was \"a loss for the whole world\" and that \"in our hearts, he will forever remain a man who dedicated his whole life to peace.\"\n\nChinmoy taught that rapid spiritual progress could be made by following a path of love, devotion, and surrender. He described divine love as self-offering and self-expansion. This practice of love and devotion to God is known as Bhakti Yoga. His path was not one of earthly renunciation or asceticism, but a middle path where the seeker has the opportunity to renounce, or transform, the negative qualities which stand in the way of union with the Divine. Chinmoy taught that meditation on the heart brings the light of the soul forward to reach the highest reality as soon as possible.\nChinmoy stated: \"We are all seekers, and our goal is the same: to achieve inner peace, light and joy, to become inseparably one with our Source, and to lead lives full of true satisfaction.\"\nAn integral element of Chinmoy's teachings is the understanding of ‘self-transcendence’. Self-transcendence is the practice of having a new goal and going beyond our previous capacities and limits which inevitably gives us joy. Self-transcendence is the goal of making progress in life by becoming a better human being rather than competing with the rest of the world. Chinmoy believes that we are all truly unlimited in spirit.\n\nChinmoy's philosophy he explains is the acceptance of life. By sharing goodwill and inspiration to others and serving mankind the world can be transformed and peace can be achieved. \n\nHe asked his disciples to adopt a vegetarian diet, abstain from recreational drugs including alcohol, and lead a pure and celibate lifestyle. Although influenced by Hinduism, his path catered to an international community of seekers from diverse backgrounds.\n\nChinmoy taught a range of techniques for meditation, especially those for calming and bringing silence to the mind, purifying the thoughts of the mind and meditating on the spiritual heart. Chinmoy explains that by keeping your mind calm and quiet for ten or fifteen minutes, a new experience can begin to dawn within you and this practise of stilling the mind is the root of all spiritual progress.\n\nChinmoy recommended meditation during the quiet atmosphere of the early morning, before starting daily activities. As the traditional Hour of God, between three and four a.m., known as the \"Brahma Muhurta\", may not suit the western lifestyle of keeping late hours, Chinmoy recommended for those newer to meditation to ideally meditate before seven a.m. Chinmoy taught that both prayer and meditation are important, but there is a difference in the result. Prayer is a process of rising up to God and speaking to Him, and meditation is a practice of stilling the mind so that the God-presence can envelop us and commune with us. He also taught that reading spiritual writings or singing soulful songs was useful to prepare for meditation or to remain in a meditative mood after practising meditation. Chinmoy believed that running and physical fitness were a help to the inner spiritual life as well as to the outer life of activity, and encouraged his followers to run daily. Chinmoy regarded the benefits of running as keeping the body fit and clearing the mind; he felt it can also be a form of external meditation.\n\nIn 1970, Chinmoy began giving twice-weekly non-denominational peace meditations at the United Nations for UN delegates, staff, and NGO representatives. In 1976 he stated, \"The ideas of the United Nations are universal peace and universal brotherhood, and the ideals of the United Nations are a oneness-world-family and a oneness-heart.\"\n\nAfter directing the peace meditations, which had been attended by many UN employees and diplomats, for 37 years, more than 700 UN officials, ambassadors, members of the U.S. Congress, and representatives of various religions, paid tributes to Chinmoy following his death during a posthumous celebration at the UN headquarters in New York. During the ceremony at the UN, Daw Aye Aye Thant, the daughter of former UN Secretary-General U Thant, said in her speech:\n\nAn integral part of Chinmoy's teaching is the respect for other paths and religions. Chinmoy wrote:\n\nChinmoy's efforts to promote inter-faith harmony resulted in him being invited to open the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago (1993) and Barcelona (2004) with a silent meditation. During the 2004 Opening Meditation, he said: \"During my opening meditation I am praying for the oneness of all religions.\"\n\nChinmoy said that although he was brought up in the Hindu tradition, he felt that his only religion was the \"Love of God\".\n\nChinmoy began painting in 1974 during a visit to Ottawa, Canada. He called his artwork \"Jharna Kala\", which in Bengali means \"fountain art\". Chinmoy's artwork is inspired by the themes of universal oneness and universal peace.\n\nHis abstract paintings are a mixture of acrylics and pen drawings. Chinmoy used a wide variety of sponges, brushes and colours to paint in a unique spontaneous mystical style with a lot of vigour, strong movement and rhythm. Chinmoy has said that when he paints he finds a spontaneous flow of creativity from the stillness of his meditation that allows him to follow an inner inspiration or ‘streak of light’ to follow.\nIn December 1991 Chinmoy started a new series of art-work entitled \"Dream-Freedom-Peace-Birds\" or ‘Soul Birds’. The bird drawings are often simple zen like sketches that have either one bird or in some paintings hundreds of birds in one large drawing. The soul bird drawings, Chinmoy stated, symbolize humanity's heart cry for freedom.\n\nHis art has been displayed in the Louvre in Paris, the UNESCO offices in Paris, London's Victoria and Albert Museum, the Mall Gallery in London, the Museum of Modern Art in St. Petersburg, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and the United Nations Headquarters. \n\nAccording to his followers, Chinmoy composed thousands of short musical compositions, written with lyrics primarily in Bengali and English. Many of these have been published online under a Creative Commons license at Sri Chinmoy Songs (lyrics and sheet music) and Radio Sri Chinmoy (audio). He released two albums in Jamaica on the Studio One subsidiary label Port-O-Jam. In 1976, Chinmoy released a meditative album on Folkways Records entitled \"Music for Meditation\".\n\nChinmoy also gave hundreds of free peace concerts in notable venues around the world, including London's Royal Albert Hall, New York's Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, Tokyo's Nippon Budokan, the Louvre in Paris, and the Sydney Opera House\n\nChinmoy played a number of different instruments at his concerts including the flute, esraj, piano, cello and other Eastern and Western instruments.\n\nAccording to the Sri Chinmoy Centre, Chinmoy published over 1,300 books including 120,000 poems. Many of these poems are aphorisms – a short but complete spiritual poem or verse, such as \"We are all truly unlimited, if we only dare to try and have faith.\" Chinmoy also published some volumes of longer more classical style poetry. In 2001, Chinmoy recited his poetry at the United Nations, as part of a UN sponsored event of promoting \"Dialogue Among Civilizations Through Poetry\". On 11 September 2010, three of Chinmoy's poems on hope were recited by New York Governor David Paterson at a ceremony to mark the ninth anniversary of 9/11.\n\nChinmoy's inspirational writing has been praised by many, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who wrote: \"These sweet gems of wisdom written by my dear friend Sri Chinmoy are timeless truths full of encouragement, love and goodness. ... These chapters fill us with indomitable hope and enthusiasm for life.\"\n\nIn 1977 the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team was founded; it holds running, swimming, and cycling events worldwide, from fun runs to ultramarathons. Its precursor was the 1976 Liberty Torch Run, a relay in which 33 runners marked America's bicentennial by covering 8,800 miles in 7 weeks through 50 states. This concept was expanded in 1987 to become the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run. The Peace Run is generally held every two years, and the first was launched in April 1987 at the World Trade Center in New York City.\n\nIn 1985 Chinmoy, with the then Mayor of Oxford, inaugurated the first \"Sri Chinmoy Peace Mile\", which is a measured mile in Cutteslowe Park, Oxford giving joggers something against which to measure their progress. There are now numerous \"Peace Miles\" around the world.\n\nMany of Chinmoy's followers run daily for health and physical fitness. Chinmoy himself continued to enter races until his 60s when a knee injury hampered his ability to run; afterwards he turned his attention to tennis and weightlifting.\n\nChinmoy also founded the Self-Transcendence 6- & 10-day Races, which run concurrently in Queens each April, and the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race, described by \"The New York Times\" as the \"Mount Everest of ultramarathons\".\n\nChinmoy began weightlifting in 1985, at the age of 54. His weightlifting included a creative array of objects and machinery designed to challenge his strength and ability. His message to the public in his weightlifting endeavours was that anything is possible if one is able to put aside the limitations of the mind. Bill Pearl, former Mr. Universe, acted as Master of Ceremonies at many of Chinmoy's strength exhibitions. Introducing one of Chinmoy's weightlifting exhibitions in 1999, Bill Pearl wrote: \"Today you are going to see some amazing feats of strength that I myself – and I have been in the industry for fifty-five years – would not even attempt to perform.\" Chinmoy said his motivation for lifting was to inspire others, especially those of an older generation. In 2006 he stated, \"If I can inspire anybody in this world, then I feel that my life is meaningful. With my weightlifting, I am offering my physical strength to inspire people.\"\n\nIn a program created in 1998 known as 'Lifting up the world with a Oneness Heart', Chinmoy lifted people of inspiration while they stood on a platform overhead. Chinmoy described his motivation: 'I lift them up to show my appreciation for their achievements,' Among some of the 7000 people he lifted include: Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Muhammad Ali, Sting, Eddie Murphy, Susan Sarandon, Roberta Flack, Yoko Ono, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Gere Helen Hunt. Twenty Nobel leaureates and a team of sumo wrestlers were also lifted.\n\nIn April 2011, a documentary film about Chinmoy's weightlifting titled \"Challenging Impossibility\" was featured at the Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nTerry Todd, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Texas, concluded that Chinmoy misrepresented the type of lift he claimed to have completed.\n\nA summary of award highlights includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book is an anthology of biographies of 100 influential Muslim personalities whom the author has selected according to their influence on Muslims throughout 15 centuries of Islam.\n\nInfluence is based on their contributions and achievements, which was the main criterion for selection and inclusion in the book. Khan measured the influence of a person by examining their lives and thoughts, and then assessed the nature of their contribution by evaluating what they actually did and what was special or extraordinary about their deeds, actions and accomplishments. In so doing, he claims to be able to determine whether their contributions and achievements had made them national, regional or international figures, and that he could evaluate the intellectual, social, political, economic or cultural importance, value and impact of their contributions and achievements over time.\n\nBy exploring the ideas, thoughts and achievements of the lives of 100 most influential Muslim rulers and conquerors, religious scholars and philosophers, writers and literary figures, scientists and explorers, military generals and freedom fighters, reformers and educationalists, this book goes through Islamic thought, history, culture and civilization.\n\nThe author's selection is representative of all periods from the advent of Islam to modern times, those who belong to a vast area and whose contributions have covered all fields of human knowledge.\n\nThe 100 most influential Muslims include 20 personalities from modern times. The 100 names include; Abū Ḥanīfa, Al-Ghazali, Ibn Arabi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, Abul A'la Maududi, and Malcolm X. Among the 100, the author listed only four females, ‘A’ishah bint Abu Bakr, Khadīja bint Khuwaylid, Fatimah and Rābiʻah al-ʻAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya.\n\nThe book ends with a chronological list of the main events in Islamic history, a select bibliography and two indices, one of names and places and the other of ideas and concepts. It is easy to read and the author avoided using technical language or unnecessary jargon words. The Muslim 100 is aimed primarily at students and lay readers.\n\n\"It is rare to see a publication which includes personalities from both Shia and Sunni schools of thought and which is so much needed in today's turbulent world. This book, I believe will... enrich our understanding of not only the historical but the contemporary history of the Muslim.\" — Ahmed J. Versi, chief editor of \"The Muslim News\".\n\n\n"}

Blanc\n\nVictor Hugo Blanc (August 31, 1897 – December 16, 1968) was a Democratic lawyer and politician from Philadelphia.\n\nBlanc was born in Philadelphia in 1897, the son of Samuel and Pauline Blanc. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Odessa, Russia (modern-day Ukraine). Blanc graduated from West Philadelphia High School before attending the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's degree and a law degree in 1919 and 1923, respectively. While still in college, he served in the United States Navy in World War I.\n\nBlanc had a private law practice before joining the state Attorney General's office. He was active in Philadelphia civic organizations and served as president of the National League of Masonic Clubs in 1938. At the outbreak of World War II, Blanc rejoined the military, this time as an officer in the United States Army Air Corps. After the war, he continued his law practice, moving to work as an assistant district attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney's office in 1950. As an assistant district attorney, Blanc won headlines by investigating police graft. That same year, he was named chairman of the County Board of Public Assistance.\n\nIn 1951, Blanc ran for Philadelphia City Council. Under the city charter adopted earlier that year, Philadelphians elected a seventeen-member city council, with ten members representing districts of the city, and the remaining seven being elected at-large; Blanc ran for one of the at-large seats. He won, part of a Democratic wave that swept the city government out of Republican control for the first time in 67 years. While on city council, Blanc led an investigation into corruption related to construction at Philadelphia International Airport.\n\nBlanc returned to prosecution in 1955 when he won election as District Attorney of Philadelphia, succeeding Richardson Dilworth, who had resigned to run for mayor. Blanc, who won the Democratic primary unopposed, handily defeated Republican Wilhelm Knauer in the general election that November. Two years later, in 1957, he was elected to a four-year term, even though Mayor Dilworth, a fellow Democrat, declined to endorse him. Before that term ended, Governor David L. Lawrence appointed Blanc to the court of common pleas to fill the remaining term of Gerald F. Flood, who had been elected to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. Blanc won election to a full ten-year term on the court in 1961. He developed Alzheimer's disease and was relieved of his duties on the court in 1964. Four years later, he died in Haverford State Hospital at the age of 71. He was buried in Mount Sinai Cemetery in Philadelphia.\n\n"}
{"id": "55748661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55748661", "title": "Victory Altar", "text": "Victory Altar\n\nThe Victory Altar (Korean \"SeungNiJeDan\") is a new religious movement founded in South Korea in 1981. It teaches that Jesus Christ was a false messiah and that the real Christ is its founder, Cho Hee-Seung (1931–2004), “the Victor Christ.” The movement had some 400,000 members in the early 1990s, but declined after Cho was arrested in 1994 and died in 2004; in 2017, membership was evaluated at around 100,000.\n\nCho Hee-Seung was born on August 12, 1931, in Gimpo, in the Gyeonggi province of South Korea. As a Christian, he was incarcerated by North Korea during the Korean War; after his liberation, he was active in Methodism and Presbyterianism. Decisive for Cho’s subsequent religious activities was his encounter with Park Tae-Seon (1915–1990), the founder of the Olive Tree (Jundokwan), a Korean Christian new religion that gathered 1,5 million followers in the 1970s before declining in the subsequent decades, and generated through various schism several other Korean religious movements. In the 1960s and 1970s, Cho operated as a successful missionary for the Olive Tree and founded several churches in South Korea.\nIn 1980, Cho went through a long retreat near Bucheon, South Korea, in one of the Faith Villages of the Olive Tree. Here, in a building known as the “Secret Chamber” (\"MilSil\"), he was initiated by Hong Eup-Bi, a woman member of the Olive Tree who was regarded as a “shaman.” The Victory Altar claims that on October 15, 1980, Hong recognized in Cho “the Victor Christ” and “God incarnated,” which led him to leave the Olive Tree and establish his own new religious movement, the Victory Altar (SeungNiJeDan), in Bucheon. The movement grew rapidly, and on August 12, 1991 the headquarters in Bucheon were completed. In few years, the Victory Altar gathered some 400,000 followers, mostly in South Korea, but with branches in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nBecause of his criticism of Jesus Christ and his own messianic claims, Cho encountered the hostility of Korean Christian churches, which promoted media campaigns against the Victory Altar and accused its founder of various wrongdoings. In 1994, Cho was arrested and spent in jail seven of the last ten years of his life. He was accused both of fraud and of having instigated the murder of six ex-members turned militant opponents of the Victory Altar. Cho was convicted for fraud, found not guilty in a first case about the murders in 1996, then found guilty in a second trial in 2004, and sentenced to death, but again found not guilty on appeal. South Korea has three degrees of judgement: the prosecutor appealed the decision favorable to Cho before the Supreme Court, but Cho died just before the trial, on June 19, 2004. The prosecution of Cho and above all his death, since many followers believed him to be physically immortal, were serious blows for the movement, which started a phase of decline, although by 2017 it still maintained 40 Victory Altars in Korea with some 100,000 followers.\nAccording to the Victory Altar, all the great sacred scriptures of humanity, including the Bible, the classics of Buddhism, and the ancient prophetic books of Korea announce the “original promise” of God, i.e. that humans may achieve physical immortality. This is the only real immortality, and the notion that a soul separated from the body will live eternally in Heaven is a false interpretation of the holy scriptures. It was also part of the message of Jesus Christ, thus evidencing that he was a false prophet, and in fact was “the only son of Satan.” Additional evidence that Jesus Christ was not a divine incarnation comes, according to the Victory Altar, from the fact that he was the son of a Roman soldier named Pantera, who might have raped his mother Mary, and that he married Mary Magdalene, widely regarded as a fallen woman. The sources for these accusations are the Roman anti-Christian philosopher Celsus and the book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, which also influenced the phenomenally successful 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.\nJesus Christ is not part of the succession of divine incarnations and prophets proposed by the Victory Altar. This starts with Adam and Eve, who were divine and immortal and formed the original Trinity with God. Not being omnipotent, however, God could not prevent Satan from capturing Adam and Eve and depriving them of their immortality. 6,000 years, and a succession of divine prophets, were needed before God could overcome Satan and offer again physical immortality to humans. A first set of prophets includes Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Dan. The latter was the legitimate successor of Jacob (as proved, the Victory Altar maintains, by the Biblical Book of Genesis, 49:16) and eventually his tribe, the Danites, migrated to Korea, whose mythical first king was called Dangun, or King Dan. Korea hosted the second set of prophets, including the founder of the Olive Tree, Park Tae-Seon, the woman who initiated Cho, Hong Eup-Bi, and Cho himself, as well as the founders of two other Korean new religions, Choe Je-u of Donghak and Gang Il-Sun of Jeungsanism.\n\nThe crucial role, in the sacred history of humanity as narrated by the Victory Altar, belongs to Cho himself, which through his initiation of 1980 overcame the “blood of Satan,” which is still present in all humans and is identified with the ego, and became “the Victor Christ,\" i.e. a divine incarnation through which God came to Earth, defeated Satan, and finally restored physical immortality for humans.. In fact, Cho was the first Human after Adam who became physically immortal. Although he had to depose (or, rather, transform) his body because of the malice of his opponents, the movement believes that he is still physically present and guides the religious services of the Victory Altar, where his image is projected through videos. Services are held daily, and five yearly feasts are also celebrated: the Victory Day (October 15), Cho’s Birthday, which is called Christmas (August 12), Messiah Day (December 25),Holy Dew Spirit Day (January 1), and Parent Day (May 8).\n\nThe “Holy Dew,” also called in the movement “Hidden Manna,” is a smoke, fog, or fire that, the movement claims. emanated from Cho’s body and portraits during his lifetime and continues to emanate from his photographs today. The Victory Altar insists that the Holy Dew is real and can be captured by cameras. It serves both as evidence of Cho’s divinity and as spiritual nourishment for his followers. According to the Victory Altar, Cho also proved his divine status by complying with the “five covenants” he had promised to his followers: the destruction of world Communism; the stopping of typhoons coming to South Korea; making harvests in Korea abundant; stopping the rainy seasons (June 15-July 15) there; preventing a new Korean war and unifying the two Koreas. The latter covenant, the movement believes, is in the process of being realized, and at any rate Cho has miraculously stopped both the return of Communism to Russia and North Korea's aggression plans against South Korea.\n\nThe main promise of Cho, however, is that at least some humans may recover physical immortality. To this aim, belief in Cho is not sufficient, and the Victory Altar teaches that pretending that mere belief can save is just another of the misconceptions propagated by Jesus Christ. Only those who fully practice the \"Law of Liberty,” by overcoming their ego and identifying with fellow human beings as one, may one day cleanse their blood from Satan’s heritage and become physically immortal. As old members age and die, insisting on physical immortality becomes difficult, which has been suggested as another explanation of the movement’s decline. Many, however, still maintain the hope and proclaim that at least some of them will never die.\n\n"}
{"id": "1038969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1038969", "title": "Wang Hsing-ching", "text": "Wang Hsing-ching\n\nWang Hsing-ching (; born 1946), who has a pseudonym of Nanfang Shuo (南方朔, Nánfāng Shuò), is a journalist, political commentator, and cultural critic. Today, he is the chief editor and writer of \"The Journalist\" magazine (新新聞週刊), with commentaries on current issues in major newspapers. His writings, including Western ideas analysis, social phenomena criticism, and literature comments, are all regarded as very influential. Crediting his intellectual contribution to the society, he is known as \"the most industrious private scholar in Taiwan\".\n\nWang earned his undergraduate degree in the School for Forestry and Resource Conservation, from National Taiwan University and a doctorate degree in Chinese Culture University. The Senkaku (Diaoyutai) Island incident made Wang reach an epiphany to become a journalist. During that period, Wang abandoned his overseas study plan and stayed in Taiwan, starting his career. In the 1970s, Wang was a reporter for the \"Taiwan Times,\" and afterwards worked as a writer, vice general editor, and general editor in \"The China Times\" (中國時報). Although he never received technical university training in journalism, he has more than twenty years of experience in the mass media as a news commentator.\n\nWang, as an author, began with topics mainly concerned about cultural changes, political changes, and the controversies in society. His early works are based on the themes of describing and criticizing cultures and politics, e.g. \"Diguo zhuyi yu Taiwan duli yundong\" (帝國主義與臺灣獨立運動). Later in his career, he started publishing critical book reviews. Recently, Wang has published a series of books about \"Language\". \"Magical Eyes,\" his latest book, (魔幻之眼) is his first published work in the book commentary collection. As a tutor through writing, his analysis focuses on culture, history, thoughts, politics, etc.\n\nWang has never been shy expressing his critical opinions on current affairs. In the summer of 2004, he attended a forum in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center concerning the political issues in Taiwan and the relation across the Taiwan Strait after the Presidential election. He suggested that the two shores of the Strait should make positive interactions in order to solve the rational problems.\n\nAs a journalist and the chief writer of \"The Journalist magazine\", he has his own independent analysis towards the political issues. Not long after President Chen Shuibien gave the speech of \"One State on Each Side\", he wrote critics on it, which was exactly to the point, \"democracy in Taiwan is already moving towards a new and populist type of soft politics of terror\".\n\nIn a public discussion titled \"How to build a mass media culture with \"taste\"? Wang criticized the current mass media culture. He pointed out that if the speakers/interviewees could not state their stance clearly, they had to \"pay the price\" in the sense that reporters might make twist their words to make a story more dramatic. The unethical reporting of some journalists disappointed Wang, and he urged that journalists had to realize that it was shameful to have disregarded the obligation to report the truth.\n\nAt societal level, he emphasized that not only does the mass media deliver information to the public, but it also affects the social structure and the political environment. He noted that journalists should bear in mind that they have great responsibilities to the general public.\n\nParticularly in Taiwan, he put the blame of the current situation on changes in political conditions. During this unstable period, different types of mass media emerged. As advertising plays a greater role in the mass media, it is inevitable that politicians would make use of the mass media for propaganda. However, he said that there are still journalists who stand by their principles, although it remains difficult for them to uphold the journalistic ethics.\n\nIn an RTHK TV program \"Merry Book Worm\" in October 2003, (愈讀愈快樂 (www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/tv/bookworm/20031026.html inactive as of 2008-05-07), 5 Oct 04.) Wang shared his opinions on how to choose suitable books for ourselves. He raised questions on how topics of certain discourses are set, why the topics are written the way they are, and how the written formats differ from author to author, and suggested that these are the aspects we have to think about when we choose books to read. Also, Wang stressed that it is necessary for every author to get the basic and wide-ranging knowledge on different areas before having any discussion or analysis. With his literature commentaries in \"Magical Eyes\" (魔幻之眼), Nanfang Shuo attempts to give his readers a brief overview on his recommended books to help them choose readings.\n\nWang’s views on literature ties in well in the principles in journalism. While literature commenting allows his audience to have a knowledge of what is currently happening in the world, reporters are also doing the same thing: making readers be aware of current affairs. Speaking about journalism, he said that we, as readers, have to be careful about different reporters’ stances and their different perspectives based on various sources. On the other hand, reporters should always bear the obligation to the truth and be objective by relying on the more reliable sources.\n\nIn another interview from Central News Agency (news.pchome.com.tw/life/can/20030408/index-20030408165736010244.html inactive as of 2008-05-07) in Taiwan, Wang pointed out that readers are not encouraged to spend too much time on books which are too difficult to be digested or too easy to read. In the interview, Wang encouraged readers to find the books which would motivate them and those which can give them new perspectives.\nApplying Wang's views on reading, journalism, and news reports, readers should focus their attention on news of particular interest to them, ones which they feel comfortable to read and criticize. Moreover, Wang believes that readers are responsible for the verification of reports.\n\nAs a commentator of literature, Wang welcomes all different genres of books. He firmly believes that all books can be beneficial and that the more one reads, the more one will gain in that field of expertise. He recalled that in his childhood, he was unable to do anything but read.\n\nOne belief of Wang is that wisdom in different aspects are all inter-related. For him, the concepts of literature, history, and social theory can be easily understood. He believes that literature, poetry, politics, and philosophy are mutually related. Having this understanding, Wang likes to use poems to interpret international politics and the economic phenomenon in recent years. This proves that as a commentator of current affairs and as chief writer of \"The Journalist\", he uses literary style to write journalistic articles.\n\nA few years ago, Wang discovered an interest in linguistics. Some of the inspirations of Wang stems from the Chinese classic literature, novels, and prose, while some of them comes from news reports. Researching the origin and history of the common vocabularies, he also investigated the changing process of these vocabularies in society. To him, this changing process can be seen from the use of language in news reports, for the language the reporters used marks the changes in social value.\nIn fact, his motivation and his way to learn about the origins of vocabulary is very applicable to the elements of journalism: both fields require accurate information, and verification by different reliable sources. We can only tell the truth (of events or the origin of vocabularies) after verifications.\n\nWang is a libertarian, and he believes that it is important to be aware of the language ambiguity in understanding readings. As there are some writers who easily confuse readers, with or without intention, great language skills and a critical mind are essential to make yourself clear about what you are reading and what the writers are telling.\n\nWang was one of the committee members to adjudicate the \"20th century 100 greatest Chinese novels\". As the novels revealed to Wang a feeling of sorrow and a sense of pressure, he commented the 20th century Chinese novels as a reflection of Chinese history in the past 100 years which he saw a difficult and suffering period for the intellectuals.\n\n\n"}
